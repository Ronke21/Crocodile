<text>The National Rally ( , RN), known as the National Front from 1972 to 2018 (, , FN), is a French far-right political party, described as right-wing populist and nationalist. It is the single largest parliamentary opposition party in the National Assembly since 2022. Its candidate was defeated in the second round in the 2002, 2017 and 2022 presidential elections. It opposes immigration, advocating significant cuts to legal immigration, protection of French identity, and stricter control of illegal immigration. The party advocates a &quot;more balanced&quot; and &quot;independent&quot; French foreign policy, opposing French military intervention in Africa while supporting France leaving NATO&#x27;s integrated command. It also supports reform of the European Union (EU) and its related organisations, as well as economic interventionism, protectionism, and zero tolerance for breaches of law and order.

The party was founded in 1972, created by the Ordre Nouveau to be the legitimate political vehicle for the far-right movement. Jean-Marie Le Pen was its founder and leader until his resignation in 2011. While its influence was marginal until 1984, the party&#x27;s role as a nationalist electoral force has grown considerably. It has put forward a candidate at every presidential election but one since 1974. In the 2002 presidential election, Jean-Marie Le Pen advanced to the second round but finished a distant second in the runoff to Jacques Chirac. His daughter Marine Le Pen was elected to succeed him as party leader in 2012. She temporarily stepped down in 2017 in order to concentrate on her presidential candidacy; she resumed her leadership after the election. She headed the party until 2021, when she temporarily resigned again. A year later, Jordan Bardella was elected as her successor.

The party has seen an increase in its popularity and acceptance in French society in recent years. It has been accused of promoting xenophobia and antisemitism. While her father was nicknamed the &quot;Devil of the Republic&quot; by mainstream media and sparked outrage for hate speech, including Holocaust denial and Islamophobia, Marine Le Pen pursued a policy of &quot;de-demonisation&quot; of the party by softening its image and trying to frame the party as being neither right nor left. She endeavoured to extract it from its far-right roots, as well as censuring controversial members like her father, who was suspended and then expelled from the party in 2015. Following her election as the leader of the party in 2011, the popularity of the FN grew. By 2015, the FN had established itself as a major political party in France. Sources traditionally label the party as far-right. However, some media outlets have started to refer to the party as &quot;right-wing populist&quot; or &quot;nationalist right&quot; instead, arguing that it has substantially moderated from its years under Jean-Marie Le Pen. 

At the FN congress of 2018, Marine Le Pen proposed renaming the party &quot;Rassemblement National&quot; (National Rally), and this was confirmed by a ballot of party members. Formerly strongly Eurosceptic, the National Rally changed policies in 2019, deciding to campaign for a reform of the EU rather than leaving it and to keep the euro as the main currency of France (together with the CFP franc for some collectivities). In 2021, Le Pen announced that she wanted to remain in the Schengen Area, citing &quot;an attachment to the European spirit&quot;, but to reserve free movement to nationals of a European Economic Area country, excluding residents of and visitors from another Schengen country.

Le Pen reached the second round of the 2017 presidential election, receiving 33.9% of the votes in the run-off and losing to Emmanuel Macron. Again in the 2022 election, she lost to Macron in the run-off, receiving 41.45% of the votes. In the 2022 parliamentary elections, the National Rally achieved a significant increase in the number of its MPs in the National Assembly, from 7 to 89 seats. In June 2024, the party, led by its president Jordan Bardella, won the European Parliament elections in a landslide with 31.4% of the votes. This caused Macron to announce a snap election to try to garner more support for his party, Ensemble. Later that month, an RN-led right-wing coalition topped the first round of the snap French legislative election with a record 33.2% of the votes. On 7 July, the RN also won the popular vote (37.06%) in the second round of the snap election, but only won the third highest number of seats.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The party&#x27;s ideological roots can be traced to both Poujadism, a populist, small business tax protest movement founded in 1953 by Pierre Poujade and on right-wing dismay over the decision by French President Charles de Gaulle to abandon his promise of holding on to the colony of French Algeria, (many , including Le Pen, were part of an inner circle of returned servicemen known as ). During the 1965 presidential election, Le Pen unsuccessfully attempted to consolidate the right-wing vote around presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour. Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, the French far-right consisted mainly of small, extreme movements such as , (GUD), and the (ON).

Espousing France&#x27;s Catholic and monarchist traditions, one of the primary progenitors of the ideology generally promoted by FN was the , founded at the end of the 19th century, and its descendants in the &quot;Restauration Nationale&quot;, a pro-monarchy group that supports the claim of the Count of Paris to the French throne.

=== Early years ===
==== Foundation (1972–1973) ====
While &quot;Ordre Nouveau&quot; had competed in some local elections since 1970, at its second congress, in June 1972, it decided to establish a new political party to contest the 1973 legislative elections. The party was launched on 5 October 1972 under the name National Front for French Unity (&quot;Front national pour l&#x27;unité française&quot;), or Front National. In order to create a broad movement, ON sought to model the new party (as it earlier had sought to model itself) on the more established Italian Social Movement (MSI), which at the time appeared to establish a broad coalition of the Italian hard right. The FN adopted a French version of the MSI tricolour flame as its logo. ON wanted to unite the various French far-right currents, and brought together &quot;nationals&quot; of Le Pen&#x27;s group and Roger Holeindre&#x27;s Party of French Unity; &quot;nationalists&quot; from Pierre Bousquet&#x27;s &quot;Militant&quot; movement or François Brigneau&#x27;s and Alain Robert&#x27;s Ordre Nouveau; the anti-Gaullist Georges Bidault&#x27;s Justice and Liberty movement; as well as former Poujadists, Algerian War veterans, and some monarchists, among others. Le Pen was chosen to be the first president of the party, as he was untainted with the militant public image of the ON and was a relatively moderate figure in the far-right.

The National Front fared poorly in the 1973 legislative elections, receiving 0.5% of the national vote, although Le Pen won 5% in his Paris constituency. In 1973, the party created a youth movement, the &quot;Front national de la jeunesse&quot; (National Front of Youth; FNJ). The rhetoric used in the campaign stressed old, far-right themes and was largely uninspiring to the electorate at the time. Otherwise, its official program at this point was relatively moderate, differing little from the mainstream right&#x27;s. Le Pen sought the &quot;total fusion&quot; of the currents in the party, and warned against &quot;crude activism.&quot; The FNJ were banned from the party later that year. The move towards the mainstream cost it many leading members and much of its militant base.

In the 1974 presidential election, Le Pen failed to find a mobilising theme for his campaign, since many of its platform&#x27;s major issues, such as anti-communism, were shared by most of the mainstream right. Other FN issues included calls for increased French birth rates, immigration reduction (although this was downplayed), establishment of a professional army, abrogation of the Évian Accords, and generally the creation of a &quot;French and European renaissance.&quot; Despite being the only nationalist candidate, he failed to gain the support of the whole of the far-right, as the various groups either rallied behind other candidates or called for voter abstention. The campaign further lost ground when the Revolutionary Communist League made public a report of Le Pen&#x27;s alleged involvement in torture during his time in Algeria. In his first participation in a presidential election, Le Pen won only 0.8% of the national vote.

==== FN–PFN rivalry (1973–1981) ====
Following the 1974 election, the FN was obscured by the appearance of the Party of New Forces (PFN), founded by FN dissidents (largely from the ON). Their competition weakened both parties throughout the 1970s. Along with the growing influence of François Duprat and his &quot;revolutionary nationalists&quot;, the FN gained several new groups of supporters in the late 1970s and early 1980s: Jean-Pierre Stirbois (1977) and his &quot;solidarists&quot;, Bruno Gollnisch (1983), Bernard Antony (1984) and his Catholic fundamentalists, as well as Jean-Yves Le Gallou (1985) and the Nouvelle Droite. Following the death of Duprat in a bomb attack in 1978, the revolutionary nationalists left the party, while Stirbois became Le Pen&#x27;s deputy as his solidarists effectively ousted the neo-fascist tendency in the party leadership. A radical group split off in 1980 and founded the French Nationalist Party, dismissing the FN as becoming &quot;too Zionist&quot; with Le Pen being a &quot;puppet of the Jews.&quot; The far right was marginalised altogether in the 1978 legislative elections, although the PFN came out better off. In the first election for the European Parliament in 1979, the PFN became part of an attempt to build a &quot;Euro-Right&quot; alliance of the continent&#x27;s far-right parties, and was in the end the only one of the two that contested the election. It fielded Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour as its primary candidate, while Le Pen called for voter abstention.

For the 1981 presidential election, both Le Pen and Pascal Gauchon of the PFN declared their intentions to run. However, an increased requirement regarding obtaining signatures of support from elected officials had been introduced for the election, which left both Le Pen and Gauchon unable to participate.

The election was won by François Mitterrand of the Socialist Party (PS), a results that brought the political left to national power for the first time in the Fifth Republic; Mitterrand immediately dissolved the National Assembly and called a snap legislative election. With only three weeks to prepare its campaign, the FN fielded only a limited number of candidates and won only 0.2% of the national vote. The PFN was even worse off, and the election marked the effective end of competition from the party. The Socialists attained their best ever result with an absolute majority in the 1981 legislative election.

The &quot;socialist takeover&quot; led to a radicalisation in centre-right, anti-communist, and anti-socialist voters.

=== Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s leadership ===
==== Electoral breakthrough (1982–1988) ====

While the French party system had been dominated by polarisation and competition between the clear-cut ideological alternatives of two political blocs in the 1970s, the two blocs had largely moved towards the centre by the mid-1980s. This led many voters to perceive the blocs as more or less indistinguishable, particularly after the Socialists&#x27; &quot;austerity turn&quot; (&quot;tournant de la rigueur&quot;) of 1983, in turn inducing them to seek out to new political alternatives. By October 1982, Le Pen supported the prospect of deals with the mainstream right, provided that the FN did not have to soften its position on &quot;key issues.&quot; In the 1983 municipal elections, the centre-right Rally for the Republic (RPR) and the centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF) formed alliances with the FN in a number of towns. The most notable result came in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, where Le Pen was elected to the local council with 11% of the vote. Subsequent by-elections kept media attention on the party, which was for the first time able to pose as a viable component of the broader right. In a by-election in Dreux in October 1983, the FN won 17% of the vote. With the choice of defeat to the political left or dealing with the FN, the local RPR and UDF agreed to form an alliance with the FN, causing a national sensation; together, they won the second round with 55% of the vote. The events in Dreux were a monumental turning point in the rise of the FN.

Le Pen protested the &quot;media boycott&quot; against his party by sending letters to President Mitterrand in mid-1982. Following an exchange of letters with Le Pen, Mitterrand instructed the heads of the main television channels to give equitable coverage to the FN. In January 1984, the party made its first appearance in a monthly poll of political popularity, in which 9% of respondents held a &quot;positive opinion&quot; of the FN and some support for Le Pen personally. The next month, Le Pen was, for the first time, invited on a prime-time television interview programme, which he himself later deemed &quot;the hour that changed everything&quot;.

In the June 1984 European elections, the FN won 11% of the vote and ten seats, in a contest that was considered to have a low level of importance by the public, which played to the party&#x27;s advantage. The FN, notably, made inroads in both right-wing and left-wing constituencies, and finished 2nd in a number of towns. While many Socialists had arguably exploited the party in order to divide the right, Mitterrand later conceded that he had underestimated Le Pen. By July, 17% of opinion poll respondents held a positive opinion of the FN.

By the early 1980s, the FN featured a mosaic of ideological tendencies and attracted figures who were previously resistant to the party. The party managed to draw supporters from the mainstream right, including some high-profile defectors from the RPR, the UDF, and the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP). In the 1984 European elections, eleven of the 81 FN candidates came from these parties, while the party&#x27;s list also included an Arab and a Jew - although in unwinnable positions. Former collaborators were also accepted in the party, as Le Pen urged the need for &quot;reconciliation&quot;, arguing that forty years after the war the only important question was whether or not &quot;they wish to serve their country&quot;. The FN won 8.7% overall support in the 1985 cantonal elections, netting over 30% in some areas.

For the 1986 legislative elections, the FN took advantage of the new, proportional representation system and won 9.8% of the vote and 35 seats in the National Assembly. Many of these seats were filled by a new wave of &quot;respectable&quot; political operatives, &quot;notables&quot;, who had joined the party after its 1984 success. The RPR won a majority with smaller, centre-right parties, and thus avoided the need to deal with the FN. Although FN was unable to exercise any real political influence, the party could project an image of political legitimacy. Several of its legislative proposals were controversial and had a socially reactionary and xenophobic character, among them attempts to restore the death penalty, expel foreigners who &quot;proportionally committed more crimes than the French&quot;, restrict naturalisation, introduce a &quot;national preference&quot; for employment, impose taxes on the hiring of foreigners by French companies, and privatise Agence France-Presse.

The party&#x27;s time in the National Assembly effectively came to an end when Jacques Chirac reinstated the two-round system of majority voting for the next election. In the regional elections held on the same day, FN won 137 seats, and gained representation in 21 of the 22 French regional councils. The RPR depended on FN support to win presidencies in some regional councils, and the FN won vice-presidential posts in four regions.

==== Consolidation (1988–1997) ====
Le Pen&#x27;s campaign for the presidential election unofficially began in the months following the 1986 election. To promote his statesmanship credentials, he made trips to South East Asia, the United States, and Africa. The management of the formal campaign, launched in April 1987, was entrusted to Bruno Mégret, one of the new &quot;notables&quot;. With his entourage, Le Pen traversed France for the entire period and, helped by Mégret, employed an American-style campaign. Le Pen&#x27;s presidential campaign was highly successful; no candidates came close to rival his ability to excite audiences at rallies and boost ratings at television appearances. Using a populist tone, he presented himself as the representative of the people against the &quot;gang of four&quot; (RPR, UDF, PS, Communist Party), while the central theme of his campaign was &quot;national preference&quot;. In the 1988 presidential election, Le Pen won an unprecedented 14.4% of the vote, and double the votes of 1984.

In the snap 1988 legislative elections, the FN was hurt by the return two-ballot majority voting, by the limited campaign period, and by the departure of many &quot;notables&quot;. In the election, the party retained its 9.8% support from the previous legislative election, but was reduced to a single seat in the National Assembly. Following some anti-Semitic comments made by Le Pen and the FN newspaper &quot;National Hebdo&quot; in the late 1980s, some valuable FN politicians left the party. Soon, other quarrels left the party without its remaining member of the National Assembly. In November 1988, general secretary Jean-Pierre Stirbois, who, together with his wife Marie-France, had been instrumental in the FN&#x27;s early electoral successes, died in a car accident, leaving Bruno Mégret as the unrivalled, de facto FN deputy leader. The party only got 5% in the 1988 cantonal elections, while the RPR announced it would reject any alliance with the FN, a rejections that now included the local level.

In the 1989 European elections, the FN held on to its ten seats, winning 11.7% of the vote.

In the wake of FN&#x27;s electoral success, the immigration debate, growing concerns over Islamic fundamentalism, and the &quot;fatwa&quot; against Salman Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini, the 1989 &quot;affaire du foulard&quot; was the first major test of the relations between the values of the French Republic and Islam. Following that success, surveys found that French public opinion was largely negative towards Islam. In a 1989 legislative by-election in Dreux, FN candidate Marie-France Stirbois, campaigning mostly on an anti-Islamism platform, returned a symbolic FN presence to the National Assembly. By the early 1990s, some mainstream politicians began also employing anti-immigration rhetoric. In the first round of the 1993 legislative elections, the FN soared to 12.7% of the overall vote, but did not win a single seat due to the nature of the electoral system. In the 1995 presidential election, votes for Le Pen rose to 15% of the total.

The FN won an absolute majority (and thus the mayorship) in three cities in the 1995 municipal elections: Toulon, Marignane, and Orange. Le Pen then declared that his party would implement its &quot;national preference&quot; policy, with the risk of provoking the central government and being at odds with the laws of the Republic. The FN&#x27;s elected representatives pursued interventionist policies with regards to the new cultural complexion of their towns by directly influencing artistic events, cinema schedules, and library holdings, as well as cutting or halting subsidies for multicultural associations. The party won Vitrolles, its fourth town, in a 1997 by-election, where similar policies were subsequently pursued. Vitrolles&#x27; new mayor , who ran in place of her husband Bruno, went further in one significant measure, introducing a special 5,000-franc allowance for babies born to at least one parent of French (or EU) nationality. The measure was ruled illegal by a court, whicn also sentenced her to a suspended prison sentence, a fine, and a two-year ban from public office.

==== Turmoil and split of the MNR (1997–2002) ====

In the 1997 legislative elections, the FN polled its best-ever result with 15.3% support in metropolitan France. The result showed that the party had become established enough to compete without its leader, who had decided not to run, in order to focus on the 2002 presidential election. Although it won only one seat in the National Assembly, in Toulon, it advanced to the second round in 132 constituencies. The FN was arguably more influential at that time than it had been in 1986 with its 35 seats. While Bruno Mégret and Bruno Gollnisch, favoured tactical cooperation with a weakened centre-right following the left&#x27;s victory, Le Pen rejected any such &quot;compromise.&quot; In the tenth FN national congress in 1997, Mégret stepped up his position in the party as its rising star and a potential leader following Le Pen. Le Pen however refused to designate Mégret as his successor-elect, and instead made his wife Jany the leader of the FN list for the upcoming European election.

Mégret and his faction left the FN in January 1999 and founded the National Republican Movement (MNR), effectively splitting the FN in half at most levels. Many of those who joined the new MNR had joined the FN in the mid-1980s, in part from the &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot;, with a vision of building bridges to the parliamentary right. Many had also been particularly influential in intellectualising the FN&#x27;s policies on immigration, identity, and &quot;national preference&quot;. Following the split, Le Pen denounced them as &quot;extremist&quot; and &quot;racist&quot;. Support for the two parties was almost equal in the 1999 European election, as the FN polled its lowest national score since 1984 with just 5.7%, and the MNR won 3.3%. The effects of the split, and competition from more moderate nationalists, resulted in their combined support being lower than the FN result of 1984.

==== Presidential run-off (2002) ====

For the 2002 presidential election, opinion polls had predicted a run-off between incumbent President Chirac and Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin. In a shock outcome, Le Pen outperformed Jospin (by 0.7%) in the 1st round, placing second and advancing to the runoff. This resulted in the first presidential run-off since 1969 without a leftist candidate and the first ever with a candidate from the far-right. To Le Pen&#x27;s advantage, the election campaign had increasingly focused on law-and-order issues, helped by media attention on a number of violent incidents. Jospin had also been weakened due to the competition between an exceptional number of leftist parties. Nevertheless, Chirac did not even have to campaign in the second round, as widespread anti-Le Pen protests from the media and public opinion culminated on May Day in a demonstration of 1.5 million participants across France. Chirac also refused to debate with Le Pen, and the traditional televised debate was cancelled. In the end, Chirac won the presidential run-off with an unprecedented 82.2% of the vote, with 71% of his votes—according to polls—cast simply &quot;to block Le Pen&quot;. Following the presidential election, the main centre-right parties merged to form the broad-based Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). The FN failed to hold on to Le Pen&#x27;s support for the 2002 legislative elections, in which it got 11.3% of the vote. It nevertheless outpolled Mégret&#x27;s MNR, which had fielded the same number of candidates but won a mere 1.1% support.

==== Decline (2003–2010) ====

A new electoral system of two-round voting had been introduced for the 2004 regional elections, in part in an attempt to reduce the FN&#x27;s influence in regional councils. The FN won 15.1% of the vote in metropolitan France, almost the same as in 1998, but its number of councillors was almost halved due to the new system. For the 2004 European elections, too, a new system less favourable to the FN had been introduced. The party regained some of its strength from 1999, earning 9.8% of the vote and seven seats.

For the 2007 presidential election, Le Pen and Mégret agreed to join forces. Le Pen came 4th in the election with 11% of the vote, and the party won no seats in the legislative election of the same year. The party&#x27;s 4.3% support was the lowest score since the 1981 election and only one candidate, Marine Le Pen in Pas de Calais, reached the runoff -where she was defeated by the Socialist incumbent. These electoral defeats partly accounted for the party&#x27;s financial problems. Le Pen announced the sale of the FN headquarters in Saint-Cloud, &quot;Le Paquebot&quot;, and of his personal armoured car. In 2008, a French court handed Le Pen a three-month suspended sentence and a €10,000 fine for remarks he made in 2005 that contravened France&#x27;s law against Holocaust denial. Twenty permanent employees of the FN were also dismissed in 2008.

In the 2010 regional elections the FN appeared to have re-emerged on the political scene after surprisingly winning almost 12% of the overall vote and 118 seats.

=== Marine Le Pen&#x27;s leadership ===
==== Revival of the FN (2011–2012) ====

Jean-Marie Le Pen announced in September 2008 that he would retire as FN president in 2010. Le Pen&#x27;s daughter Marine Le Pen and FN executive vice-president Bruno Gollnisch campaigned to succeed Le Pen, with Marine&#x27;s candidacy backed by her father. On 15 January 2011, it was announced that Marine Le Pen had received the two-thirds vote needed to become the new leader of the FN. She embarked on a project to transform the FN into a &quot;mainstream party&quot; by softening its xenophobic image. Opinion polls showed the party&#x27;s popularity increase under Marine Le Pen, and in the 2011 cantonal elections the party won 15% of the overall vote (up from 4.5% in 2008). However, due to the French electoral system, the party only won 2 of the 2,026 seats that were up for election.

At the end of 2011, the National Front withdrew from the far-right Alliance of European National Movements and joined the more moderate European Alliance of Freedom. In October 2013, Bruno Gollnisch and Jean-Marie Le Pen resigned from their position in the AENM.

For the 2012 presidential election, opinion polls showed Marine Le Pen as a serious challenger, with a few polls even suggesting that she could win the first round of the election. In the event, Le Pen came 3rd in the first round, scoring 17.9% – the best showing ever in a presidential election for the FN at that time.

In the 2012 legislative election, the National Front won two seats: Gilbert Collard and Marion Maréchal.

In two polls about presidential favourites, conducted in April and May 2013, Marine le Pen polled ahead of president François Hollande but behind Nicolas Sarkozy.

==== Electoral successes (2012–2017) ====
In the municipal elections held on 23 and 30 March 2014, lists officially supported by the National Front won mayoralties in 12 cities: Beaucaire, Cogolin, Fréjus, Hayange, Hénin-Beaumont, Le Luc, Le Pontet, Mantes-la-Ville, the 7th arrondissement of Marseille, Villers-Cotterêts, Béziers and Camaret-sur-Aigues. While some of these cities were in southern France (like Fréjus) which traditionally votes more for right-wing parties than the rest of the country, others were located in northern France, where Socialist Party had been strong until the 2010s. Following these elections, the National Front had, in cities of over 1,000 inhabitants, 1,546 and 459 councilors at two different levels of local government.

The international media described the results as &quot;historic&quot;, and &quot;impressive&quot;, although the &quot;International Business Times&quot; suggested that &quot;hopes for real political power remain a fantasy&quot; for the National Front.
The National Front received 4,712,461 votes in the 2014 European Parliament election, finishing first with 24.86% of the vote and 24 of France&#x27;s 74 seats. This was said to be &quot;the first time the anti-immigrant, anti-EU party had won a nationwide election in its four-decade history.&quot; The party&#x27;s success came as a &quot;shock&quot; in France and the EU.

==== Presidential and parliamentary election, rebranding (2017–2022) ====

On 24 April 2017, a day after the first round of the presidential election, Marine Le Pen announced that she would temporarily step down as the party&#x27;s leader in an attempt to &quot;unite voters.&quot; In the second round of voting, Le Pen was defeated 66.1% to 33.9% by her rival Emmanuel Macron of En Marche!

During the following parliamentary elections, the FN received 13.02% of the vote, a little lower than the 13.07% of the 2012 elections. The party appeared to have suffered from a demobilisation of its voters from the previous vote. Nonetheless, eight deputies (six FN and two affiliated) were elected, the best number for the FN in a parliamentary election using a majoritarian electoral system since its creation. Marine Le Pen was elected to the National Assembly for the first time, while Gilbert Collard was re-elected. FN&#x27;s 23-year-old Ludovic Pajot became the youngest ever member of the French parliament.

In late 2017, Florian Philippot left the FN and formed The Patriots, on the grounds that the FN had &quot;softened&quot; its position on leaving the EU and abandoning the Euro.
At the conclusion of the 11 March 2018 party congress in Lille, Marine Le Pen proposed renaming the party to &quot;Rassemblement national&quot; (National Rally) while keeping the flame as its logo. The new name was put to a vote among all party members. &quot;Rassemblement national&quot; had already been used as the name of a French party, the Rassemblement National Français, led by the radical-right lawyer Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour. His presidential campaign in 1965 had been managed by Jean-Marie Le Pen. The name had also been used by the FN previously, for its parliamentary group between 1986 and 1988. However, the name change faced opposition from an already-existing party named &quot;Rassemblement national&quot;, whose president, Igor Kurek, described it as &quot;Gaullist and republican right&quot;: the party had previously registered its name with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2013. On 1 June, Le Pen announced that the name change was approved by party adherents with 80.81% in favour.

During that party congress, Steve Bannon, former advisor to Donald Trump before and after his 2016 election, gave what has been described as a &quot;populist pep talk&quot;. Bannon advised the party members to &quot;Let them call you racist, let them call you xenophobes, let them call you nativists. Wear it like a badge of honor. Because every day, we get stronger and they get weaker. ... History is on our side and will bring us victory.&quot; Bannon&#x27;s remarks brought the members to their feet.

In January 2019, ex-Sarkozy minister Thierry Mariani and former conservative lawmaker Jean-Paul Garraud, left Les Republicains (LR) and joined the National Rally.

During a 2021 debate, Marine Le Pen was called &quot;soft&quot; on Islam by the Minister of the Interior in Macron&#x27;s government, Gérald Darmanin. Marine Le Pen called for a &quot;national-unity government&quot; that would include persons such as Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, former LR officials, and souverainistes on the left, such as former economy minister Arnaud Montebourg.

In the months before the 2021 French regional elections, political commentators noted an increased moderation in the FN&#x27;s platform that aimed to attract conservative voters, as well as a new image being promoted by the party as a force of &quot;la droite populaire&quot;, i.e. the popular right, the social right. The party, nonetheless, fared badly in these elections.

In the 2022 French presidential election, Le Pen again reached the 2nd round with 23.15% of the votes, though she was defeated by incumbent Macron, after receiving 41.45% of the votes in the run-off.

In the 2022 French legislative election, for which polling had indicated that FN would win only between 15 and 45 seats in the National Assembly, the party received 18.68% of the votes in the first round and won 89 seats in the second round, a significant increase from the previous total of 8 seats. The 89 seats enabled the National Rally to form a parliamentary group, for which at least 15 deputies are required, for the first time since 1986, when the national assembly was elected by proportional voting. The result made the party the 3rd largest party in the assembly and the largest parliamentary opposition group.

=== Jordan Bardella&#x27;s leadership ===

Jordan Bardella was elected president of the RN on 5 November 2022, ending Marine Le Pen&#x27;s period as president of the party. Le Pen remained president of the RN&#x27;s parliamentary group.

====2024 European parliament election====

In the 2024 European parliamentary elections, the RN won the most delegates of any single party (30). On 8 July, Bardella became president of the Patriots for Europe, originally founded by Viktor Orbán with the Czech ANO and the Austrian FPÖ parties on a platform of refusing military aid to Ukraine, anti-immigration, and pro-&quot;traditional family&quot; values. The group, the third largest in the parliament, also includes members from the Flemish Vlaams Belang, the Dutch PVV, and the Italian Lega per Salvini Premier.

The National Rally&#x27;s success in the European elections led to the dissolution of the French lower house by Emmanuel Macron on 9 June 2024.

==== 2024 legislative election ====

In June 2024, the party joined with the micro-party &quot;To the right! Friends of Eric Ciotti&quot;, forming the union of the far-right in the 2024 French legislative election. Together, these parties secured the largest share of the vote in the first round with 33.15% of the vote. More voters who reported struggling financially voted for the RN than for any other party.

Based on their first round performance, the RN will receive around €15 million per year in government subsidies for the next five years: each vote in the first round was worth €1.61 per year to the party.

According to opinion polls, the National Rally were expected to get 230-270 seats, close to an absolute majority, However, 2–3 days before the second round, the RN were predicted to win around 170-220 seats. After the exit polls on 7 July, that figure was reduced to 120-170 seats, and the New Popular Front were predicted to win around 150-190 seats, slightly ahead of president Macron&#x27;s Ensemble alliance who were expected to win 140-160 seats. Finally, the RN won only 142 seats, ranking third in the election. 

== Ideology ==
The party&#x27;s ideology has been broadly described by scholars, including James Shields, Nonna Mayer, Jean-Yves Camus, Nicolas Lebourg and Michel Winock as nationalist, far-right (or &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot;) and populist. Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg, following Pierre-André Taguieff&#x27;s analysis, include the party in an old French tradition of &quot;national populism&quot; that can be traced back to Boulangism. National populists combine the social values of the left and the political values of the right, and advocate a referendary republic that would bypass traditional political divisions and institutions. Aiming at a unity of the political (the &quot;demos&quot;), ethnic (the &quot;ethnos&quot;) and social (the &quot;working class&quot;) interpretations of the &quot;people&quot;, they claim to defend the &quot;average Frenchman&quot; and &quot;common sense&quot;, against the &quot;betrayal of inevitably corrupt elites&quot;. The party has been also described as national conservative.

The FN has changed considerably since its foundation, pursuing the principles of modernisation and pragmatism, and adapting to the changing political climate. Its message increasingly influenced mainstream political parties, and some commentators described it as right-wing, moving closer towards the centre-right. In the 2010s, the party attempted to &quot;de-demonise&quot; its image and changed its name to National Rally. A 2022 Kanar survey found that 46% of French voters saw Marine Le Pen as &quot;representing a patriotic Right attached to traditional values&quot;, although 50% saw her as &quot;a danger to democracy&quot;.

=== Society ===
The party opposed the 2016 criminalisation of the use of prostitution in France, on the grounds that it would negatively affect the safety of sex workers.

==== Feminism ====
In the 2002 legislative elections, the first under the new gender parity provision in the French Constitution, Le Pen&#x27;s National Front was among the few parties to come close to meeting the law, with 49% female candidates; Jospin&#x27;s Socialists had 36%, and Chirac&#x27;s UMP had 19.6%. Women voters in France were traditionally more attracted to mainstream conservative parties than the radical right until the 2000s. The proportion of women in the party has risen to 39% by 2017.

==== Law and order ====
In 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen campaigned on a law-and-order platform of zero tolerance, harsher sentencing, increased prison capacity, and a referendum on re-introducing the death penalty. In its 2001 programme, the party linked the breakdown of law and order to immigration, deeming immigration a &quot;mortal threat to civil peace in France.&quot;

Marine Le Pen rescinded the party&#x27;s traditional support for the death penalty with her 2017 campaign launch, instead announcing support for imprisonment &quot;in perpetuity&quot; for the &quot;worst crimes&quot; in February 2017. In 2022, she proposed to hold a referendum on capital punishment in France if she were elected.

=== Immigration ===

Since its early years, the party has called for immigration to be reduced. The theme of exclusion of non-European immigrants was brought into the party in 1978 and became increasingly important in the 1980s.

After the 1999 split, the FN cultivated a more moderate image on immigration and Islam, no longer calling for the systematic repatriation of legal immigrants but still supporting the deportation of illegal, criminal or unemployed immigrants.

Following the Arab Spring (2011) rebellions in several countries, Marine Le Pen campaigned for a halt to the migration of Tunisian and Libyan immigrants to Europe.

In November 2015, the party stated as its goal to have a net legal immigration rate (immigrants minus emigrants) of 10,000 in France per year. Since 2017, that yearly net immigration rate was around 182,000 if one takes into account only people born abroad from non-French parents, but was around 44,000 if one includes also the departures and returns of French expatriates.

In 2022, Marine Le Pen proposed an end to “family reunification” rights for foreigners with residency permits and the end to the right to automatic citizenship for children born in France to foreigners living there. She also supported a referendum on immigration policy.

==== Islam ====
The National Rally has sought to restrict Islamic practice in France. In 2011, Marine Le Pen warned that wearing full face veils are &quot;the tip of the iceberg&quot; of Islamisation of French culture. In 2021, and again in 2022, Le Pen again proposed banning the hijab (headscarf which only covers the head but not face) in public. Le Pen also proposed to ban the production of both halal and kosher meat. Le Pen says she is &quot;against the visibility of Islam&quot; but not Islam per se.
The National Rally is considered Islamophobic by many. The party has connected immigration to Islamic terrorism.

=== Economy ===
At the end of the 1970s, Jean-Marie Le Pen broke away from the anti-capitalist heritage of Poujadism and espoused a market liberal and anti-statist programme which included lower taxes, reducing state intervention, reducing the size of the public sector, privatisation, and scaling back government bureaucracy. Some scholars have characterised the FN&#x27;s 1978 programme as &quot;Reaganite before Reagan&quot;.

The party&#x27;s economic policy shifted from the 1980s to the 1990s from neoliberalism to protectionism. This occurred within the framework of a changed international environment, from a battle between the Free World and Communism, to one between nationalism and globalisation. During the 1980s, Jean-Marie Le Pen complained about the rising number of &quot;social parasites&quot;, and called for deregulation, tax cuts, and the phasing-out of the welfare state. As the party gained growing support from the economically vulnerable, it converted towards politics of social welfare and economic protectionism. This was part of its shift away from its former claim of being the &quot;social, popular, and national right&quot; to its claim of being &quot;neither right nor left – French!&quot; Increasingly, the party&#x27;s program became an amalgam of free market and welfarist policies. By the 2010s, some political commentators described its economic policies as left-wing.

Under Marine Le Pen, the RN has supported economic nationalism, which it calls &quot;economic patriotism&quot;, and it has advocated populist policies, such as tax cuts for people under 30 years old, and cuts in the value-added tax on energy and essential products. The party has supported public services, protectionism, and economic intervention, and opposed the increase in the fuel tax in 2018, and the increase in the retirement age in 2023.

Under Jordan Bardella, the RN has adopted some more pro-market policies, including lower taxes, and simplification of industrial norms. Bardella advocated an audit of public finances as a precursor to determining the 2025 budget. Bardella has sought to use these policies to court business support during the 2024 French legislative election campaign. During this time, Bardella also rescinded the prior RN pledge to repeal the 2023 French pension reform law.

=== Climate ===
Le Pen does not plan to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, but has stated that climate change is &quot;not the priority&quot; of the party. The party is against measures to tackle climate change and protecting the environment. The National Rally has proposed abolition of the European Green Deal, highlighting key policies it opposes such as the 2035 ban on fossil fuel cars.

=== Foreign policy ===
From the 1980s to the 1990s, the party&#x27;s policy shifted from favouring the European Union to turning against it. In 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen campaigned on pulling France out of the EU and re-introducing the franc as the country&#x27;s national currency. In the early 2000s the party denounced the Schengen, Maastricht, and Amsterdam treaties as foundations for &quot;a supranational entity spelling the end of France.&quot; In 2004, the party criticised the EU as &quot;the last stage on the road to world government&quot;, likening it to a &quot;puppet of the New World Order.&quot; It also proposed breaking all institutional ties back to the Treaty of Rome, while it returned to supporting a common European currency to rival the United States dollar. Further, it rejected the possible accession of Turkey to the EU. The FN was also one of several parties that backed France&#x27;s 2005 rejection of the Treaty for a European Constitution. In other issues, Le Pen opposed the invasions of Iraq, led by the United States, both in the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq War. He visited Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in 1990, and subsequently considered him a friend.

Marine Le Pen advocated France leaving the euro (along with Spain, Greece and Portugal) – although that policy was dropped in 2019. She also wants to reintroduce customs borders and has campaigned against allowing dual citizenship. During both the 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis and the 2011 Libyan civil war, she opposed the French military involvements. However, the party supported the 2013 Operation Serval in Mali against Islamist militants in the country, because it was at the request of the Malian government.

Le Pen has praised Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for &quot;fighting radical Islam&quot;, stating that Egypt&#x27;s &quot;ability to separate extremist Islam from the religion sets an example to the rest of the world, including France, of how to deal with poisonous ideologies&quot;. The party has also favourably contrasted the United Arab Emirates&#x27;s opposition to Islamism with the more pro-Islamist position taken by Qatar. The party has advocated closer France–Morocco relations, criticising Macron&#x27;s attempts to deepen ties with Algeria. In January 2023, the National Rally was one of only four parties in the European Parliament that voted against a resolution condemning Morocco&#x27;s treatment of journalist Omar Radi. It praised the 2024 recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara and suggested the French government should have acted sooner.

Le Pen supports the restoration of France-Syria relations and called for cooperation with Israel, the United States, Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia to support the economic recovery of Lebanon from the Lebanese economic crisis. The party supports a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict and welcomed the Abraham Accords. The party has shifted towards more pro-Israel policies over time, particularly following the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. Bardella has expressed opposition to recognition of Palestinian statehood following the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, on the grounds that this would be &quot;recognising terrorism&quot;. Following the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Le Pen suggested that a ceasefire would be impossible without the &quot;dismantling&quot; of Hezbollah.

==== Russia and Ukraine ====
Marine Le Pen described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a &quot;defender of the Christian heritage of European civilisation.&quot; The National Front considers that Ukraine has been subjugated by the United States, through the Revolution of Dignity. The National Front denounces anti-Russian feelings in Eastern Europe and the submission of Western Europe to &quot;Washington&#x27;s&quot; interests in the region. Marine Le Pen is very critical against the threats of sanctions directed by the international community against Russia: &quot;European countries should seek a solution through diplomacy rather than making threats that could lead to an escalation.&quot; She argues that the United States is leading a new Cold War against Russia. She sees no other solution for peace in Ukraine than to organise a kind of federation that would allow each region to have a large degree of autonomy. She thinks Ukraine should be sovereign and free as any other nation.

Luke Harding wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the National Front&#x27;s MEPs were a &quot;pro-Russian bloc.&quot; In 2014, the &quot;Nouvel Observateur&quot; said that the Russian government considered the National Front &quot;capable of seizing power in France and changing the course of European history in Moscow&#x27;s favour.&quot; According to the French media, party leaders had frequent contact with Russian ambassador Alexander Orlov and Marine Le Pen made multiple trips to Moscow. In May 2015, one of her advisers, Emmanuel Leroy, attended an event in Donetsk marking the &quot;independence&quot; of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic.

The RN remains divided on relations with Russia, with Bardella stating that he believed Russia was a threat to French security, while Thierry Mariani suggested it was not a threat to France or Europe. The more pro-Russian Mariani has been described as in conflict with Pierre-Romain Thionnet, who has advocated a more pro-Ukrainian line, with Bardella maintaining a balance between the two positions.

During the 2022 French presidential election, Le Pen supported sending non-lethal defensive aid to Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian War, but not heavy weapons that would make France a &quot;co-belligerent&quot; in the conflict. Similarly, Bardella has expressed support for defense equipment, ammunition and logistical assistance to Ukraine, but maintains opposition to giving long-range missiles to Ukraine or deploying French soldiers there. He is also opposed to Ukrainian NATO membership, suggesting it could escalate the war.

==== European Union ====
Since their entry into the European Parliament in 1979, the National Rally has promoted a message of being pro-Europe, but anti-EU. However, in 2019, the proposal that France leave the Eurozone and the EU was removed from the party&#x27;s manifesto, which has since called for &quot;reform from within&quot; of the union. The party advocates that EU legislation should be initiated by the Council of the EU rather than the European Commission, and that French laws should have primacy over EU laws.

==== NATO ====
The party&#x27;s stance on NATO has varied throughout the years. Under Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s leadership, the party advocated a complete withdrawal from the organization, while under Marine Le Pen&#x27;s leadership, the party has softened its stance to instead advocate leaving NATO&#x27;s integrated military command structure, which France joined in 2009. Jordan Bardella later added that the RN would not advocate withdrawing France from the integrated command while the Russian invasion of Ukraine was ongoing.

=== Electoral reform and referendums ===
The National Rally has advocated for full proportional representation in France, claiming that the two-round system disenfranchises voters. In early 2021, Marine Le Pen, along with centrist politician François Bayrou and green politician Julien Bayou, cosigned a letter asking President Emmanuel Macron to implement proportional representation for future elections.

The party advocates referendums on key issues such as the death penalty, immigration policy, and constitutional change. In 2022, Marine Le Pen stated: &quot;I want the referendum to become a classic operating tool.&quot;

== Controversies ==
=== Opinions on the holocaust, and relations with Jewish groups ===
There has been a difference between Marine Le Pen&#x27;s and her father&#x27;s opinions concerning the Holocaust and Jews. In 2005, Jean-Marie Le Pen wrote in the far-right weekly magazine &quot;Rivarol&quot; that the German occupation of France &quot;was not particularly inhumane, even if there were a few blunders, inevitable in a country of 640,000 square kilometres (250,000 sq. mi.)&quot; and in 1987 referred to the Nazi gas chambers as &quot;a point of detail of the history of the Second World War&quot;. He has repeated the latter claim several times. In 2004, Bruno Gollnisch said: &quot;I do not question the existence of concentration camps, but historians could discuss the number of deaths. As to the existence of gas chambers, it is up to historians to determine&quot;. Jean-Marie Le Pen was fined for these remarks, but Gollnisch was found not guilty by the Court of Cassation. The leader of the party, Marine Le Pen, distanced herself for a time from the party machine in protest at her father&#x27;s comments. In response to her father&#x27;s remarks, Marine Le Pen referred to the Holocaust as the &quot;abomination of abominations&quot;.

During the 2012 presidential election, Marine Le Pen sought the support of Jewish people in France. Interviewed by the Israeli daily newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; about the fact that some of her European senior colleagues had formed alliances with, and visited, some Israeli settlers and groups, Marine Le Pen said: &quot;The shared concern about radical Islam explains the relationship ... but it is possible that behind it is also the need of the visitors from Europe to change their image in their countries ... As far as their partners in Israel are concerned, I myself don&#x27;t understand the idea of continuing to develop the settlements. I consider it a political mistake and would like to make it clear in this context that we must have the right to criticise the policy of the State of Israel – just as we are allowed to criticise any sovereign country – without it being considered anti-Semitism. After all, the National Front has always been Zionistic and always defended Israel&#x27;s right to exist&quot;. She has opposed the emigration of French Jews to Israel in response to radical Islam, explaining: &quot;The Jews of France are Frenchmen, they&#x27;re at home here, and they must stay here and not emigrate. The country is obligated to provide solutions against the development of radical Islam in problematic areas&quot;.

=== Czecho-Russian bank loan ===
In November 2014, Marine Le Pen confirmed that the party had received a €9 million loan from the First Czech Russian Bank (FCRB) in Moscow to the National Front. Senior FN officials from the party&#x27;s political bureau informed Mediapart that this was the first instalment of a €40 million loan, although Marine Le Pen has disputed this. &quot;The Independent&quot; said the loans &quot;take Moscow&#x27;s attempt to influence the internal politics of the EU to a new level&quot;. Reinhard Bütikofer stated, &quot;It&#x27;s remarkable that a political party from the motherland of freedom can be funded by Putin&#x27;s sphere—the largest European enemy of freedom&quot;. Marine Le Pen argued that it was not a donation from the Russian government but a loan from a private Russian bank because no other bank would give her a loan. This loan is meant to prepare future electoral campaigns and to be repaid progressively. Marine Le Pen has publicly disclosed all the rejection letters that French banks have sent to her concerning her loan requests. Since November 2014, she insists that if a French bank agrees to give her a loan, she would break her contract with the FCBR, but she has not received any other counter-propositions. Le Pen accused the banks of collusion with the government. In April 2015, a Russian hacker group published texts and emails between Timur Prokopenko, a member of Putin&#x27;s administration, and Konstantin Rykov, a former Duma deputy with ties to France, discussing Russian financial support to the National Front in exchange for its support of Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea, though this has not coalesced.

=== Links with banned neo-fascist group ===
A 2019 undercover investigation by Al Jazeera uncovered links between high-ranking National Rally figures and Generation Identity, a far-right group. In secretly taped conversations, RN leaders endorsed goals of Generation Identity and discussed plans to &quot;remigrate&quot; immigrants, effectively sending them back to their countries of origin, if the RN came to power. Christelle Lechevalier, a RN Member of the European Parliament (MEP), said that many RN leaders held similar opinions as the GI, but sought to hide them from voters.

=== Alleged payment of party officials with EU funds ===

In December 2023, 28 people, including Marine Le Pen and her father Jean Marie, were ordered to stand trial after they were charged with a scheme which involved paying National Rally party officials through EU funds which were earmarked for European Parliament assistants.

== Organization ==

=== Elected representatives ===
As of February 2023, the National Rally has 88 MPs. They sit in the National Assembly as members of the National Rally group.

=== International affiliation and relations ===
====1980s-2000s====
The FN has been part of several groups in the European Parliament. The first group it helped co-establish was the European Right after the 1984 election, which also consisted of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), its early inspiration, and the Greek National Political Union. Following the 1989 election, it teamed up with the German Republicans and the Belgian Vlaams Blok in a new European Right group, while the MSI left due to the Germans&#x27; arrival. As the MSI evolved into the National Alliance, it chose to distance itself from the FN.

From 1999 to 2001, the FN was a member of the Technical Group of Independents.

In 2007, it was part of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group. Between the mentioned groups, the party sat among the non-affiliated Non-Inscrits. It was part of the Identity and Democracy group, which also includes the Freedom Party of Austria, Italian Northern League, Vlaams Belang, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the Czech Freedom and Direct Democracy, the Dutch Freedom Party, the Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia, the Finns Party, and the Danish People&#x27;s Party.

It was formerly known as the Europe of Nations and Freedom group, during which time it also included the Polish Congress of the New Right, a former member of the UK Independence Party and a former member of Romania&#x27;s Conservative Party. The RN has also been part of the Identity and Democracy Party (formerly the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom) since 2014, which additionally includes Slovakia&#x27;s We Are Family and the Bulgarian Volya Movement, which was later renamed Patriots.eu. After the 2024 European Parliament election, the National Rally joined the Patriots for Europe group with Fidesz, Vox, the Czech ANO 2011, the Portuguese Chega, the Greek Voice of Reason, Latvia First and most former ID members, with Bardella ultimately chairing the group.

During Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s presidency, the party has also been active in establishing extra-parliamentary confederations. During the FN&#x27;s 1997 national congress, the FN established the loose Euronat group, which consisted of a variety of European right-wing parties. Having failed to cooperate in the European Parliament, Le Pen sought in the mid-1990s to initiate contacts with other far-right parties, including from non-EU countries. The FN drew most support in Central and Eastern Europe, and Le Pen visited the Turkish Welfare Party. The significant Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) refused to join the efforts, as Jörg Haider sought to distance himself from Le Pen, and later attempted to build a separate group. In 2009, the FN joined the Alliance of European National Movements; it left the alliance since. Along with some other European parties, the FN in 2010 visited Japan&#x27;s &quot;Issuikai&quot; (&quot;right-wing&quot;) movement and the Yasukuni Shrine.

====2010s====
At a conference in 2011, the two new leaders of the FN and the FPÖ, Marine Le Pen and Heinz-Christian Strache, announced deeper cooperation between their parties. Pursuing her de-demonisation policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the National Front, joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF). The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognised by the European Parliament. The EAF has individual members linked to the Austrian Freedom Party of Heinz-Christian Strache, the UK Independence Party, and other movements such as the Sweden Democrats, Vlaams Belang (Belgian Flanders), Germany (Bürger in Wut), and Slovakia (Slovak National Party).

During her 2012 visit to the United States, Marine Le Pen met two Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives associated with the Tea Party movement, Joe Walsh, who is known for his strong stance against Islam, which Domenic Powell argues, rises to Islamophobia and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul, whom Le Pen complimented for his stance on the gold standard. In February 2017, two more conservative Republican Congressmen, Steve King and Dana Rohrabacher, also met with Le Pen in Paris.

The party also has ties to Steve Bannon, who served as White House Chief Strategist under President Donald Trump, and addressed an RN event in 2018.

The FN allied with the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) in November 2013, after years of the PVV rejecting collaboration with the FN. Similarly, in December 2013, the FN formed an alliance with Matteo Salvini, the new leader of the Lega Nord, which had previously eschewed cooperation with the FN when it was led by Umberto Bossi.

In 2014, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage was critical of the FN, claiming that the FN&#x27;s association with &quot;anti-Semitism and general prejudice&quot; made it impossible for UKIP to join Le Pen&#x27;s efforts for a united right-wing populist European Parliament group despite an invitation from PVV leader Wilders.

In 2017, Marine Le Pen met with and was interviewed for the British radio station LBC by Farage, who praised Le Pen and expressed support for her presidential bid. Prior to the 2019 European Parliament election, Farage&#x27;s Brexit Party initially considered forming a joint group in the next European Parliament, but ultimately once again declined. In 2024, Farage, in his capacity as the leader of Reform UK, distanced himself from the RN, describing its economic agenda as a &quot;disaster&quot; for France.

Though the FN had close contacts with Giorgia Meloni&#x27;s Brothers of Italy (FdI) from 2013 onwards,

the relationship between the RN and FdI became strained in 2022, after Meloni publicly declined to support Le Pen&#x27;s 2022 presidential bid.

In 2023, Meloni complained to French President Emmanuel Macron after he compared her to Le Pen, while Le Pen criticised Meloni&#x27;s illegal immigration policies.

However, in early 2024, Le Pen and Meloni made overtures to one another, declining to rule out future cooperation between their parties. In July 2024, Meloni praised Le Pen&#x27;s alliance with Eric Ciotti and Marion Maréchal during the 2024 French legislative election, congratulated the RN on its success in the first round of the election, and expressed preference for the right-wing alliance in the second round of the election.

In addition, the party has had relations with Krasimir Karakachanov&#x27;s IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement in 2014 and Nenad Popović&#x27;s Serbian People&#x27;s Party since 2021. The RN was critical of the decision to allow the Bulgarian Revival to join the ID Party in 2024.

Since 2018, the RN has had relations with Santiago Abascal&#x27;s Vox in Spain. In 2024, Vox had Le Pen address its conference, despite Vox being a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group; after the election, Vox joined the RN in Patriots for Europe.

In 2019, RN MEPs participated in the first international delegation to visit India&#x27;s Jammu and Kashmir following the decision by Narendra Modi&#x27;s Bharatiya Janata Party government to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. The delegation was not sanctioned by the European Parliament, and consisted mostly of right-wing populist politicians including MEPs from Vox, AfD, the Northern League, Vlaams Belang, the British Brexit Party, and Poland&#x27;s Law and Justice party.

====2020s====
In October 2021, Le Pen met with Fidesz leader and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki from the Law and Justice (PiS) party, and Slovenian Democratic Party leader and Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša. Both PiS and Fidesz had previously rejected cooperation with Le Pen in 2019. Orbán subsequently supported Le Pen during the 2022 French presidential election. Morawiecki later expressed openness to the RN joining the European Conservatives and Reformists Group in February 2024.

Relations with the AfD deteriorated in early 2024, following Le Pen&#x27;s disagreements with the AfD members&#x27; discussions over remigration and the AfD questioning French control of Mayotte. In May 2024, the RN announced it would end its alliance with the AfD in the next European Parliament term.

During the 2024 French legislative election, Israeli minister Amichai Chikli expressed support for Le Pen and the National Rally, and suggested that Likud leader and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared his views, prompting a rebuke by President Macron. Chikli later described his relations with the RN, stating it was &quot;natural that conservative leaders will have good relations with conservative leaders all across the globe&quot;.

== Election results ==
The National Front was a marginal party in 1973, the first election it participated in, but the party made its breakthrough in the 1984 European Parliament election, where it won 11% of the vote and ten MEPs. Following this election, the party&#x27;s support mostly ranged from around 10 to 15%, although it saw a drop to around 5% in some late 2000s elections. Since 2010, the party&#x27;s support seems to have increased towards its former heights. The party managed to advance to the final round of the 2002 French presidential election, although it failed to attract much more support after the initial first round vote. In the late 2000s the party suffered decline in elections. Under Marine Le Pen&#x27;s presidency the party has increased its vote share significantly. The National Front came first in a national election for the first time during the 2014 European elections, when it gained 24% of the vote. During the 2017 presidential election the party advanced to the second round of the election for the second time, and doubled the percentage it received in the 2002 presidential election, earning 34%. In the 2019 European elections the rebranded National Rally retained its spot as first party.

<text>Liliopsida (synonym: Liliatae) is a botanical name for the class containing the family Liliaceae (or Lily Family). It is considered synonymous (or nearly synonymous) with the name monocotyledon. Publication of the name is credited to Scopoli (in 1760): see author citation (botany). This name is formed by replacing the termination &quot;-aceae&quot; in the name Liliaceae by the termination &quot;-opsida&quot; (Art 16 of the ICBN).

Although in principle it is true that circumscription of this class will vary with the taxonomic system being used, in practice this name is very strongly linked to the Cronquist system, and the allied Takhtajan system. These two are the only major systems to use the name, and in both these systems it refers to the group more widely known as the monocotyledons. Earlier systems referred to this group by the name Monocotyledones, with Monocotyledoneae an earlier spelling (these names may be used in any rank). Systems such as the Dahlgren and Thorne systems (more recent than the Takhtajan and Cronquist systems) refer to this group by the name Liliidae (a name in the rank of subclass). Modern systems, such as the APG and APG II systems refer to this group by the name monocots (a name for a clade). Therefore, in practice the name Liliopsida will almost surely refer to the usage as in the Cronquist system.

In summary the monocotyledons were named:
* Monocotyledoneae in the de Candolle system and the Engler system.
* Monocotyledones in the Bentham &amp; Hooker system and the Wettstein system
* class Liliatae and later Liliopsida in the Takhtajan
* class Liliopsida in the Cronquist system (also in the Reveal system).
* subclass Liliidae in the Dahlgren system and the Thorne system (1992)
* clade monocots in the APG system, the APG II system and the APG III system.
Each of the systems mentioned above use their own internal taxonomy for the group.

==Liliopsida in the Takhtajan system==
The Takhtajan system used this internal taxonomy:

* class Liliopsida [ = monocotyledons]
*: subclass Liliidae
*:: superorder Lilianae
*:: superorder Dioscoreanae
*: subclass Commelinidae
*:: superorder Bromelianae

<text>Frederick Carlton Lewis (born July 1, 1961) is an American former track and field athlete who won nine Olympic gold medals, one Olympic silver medal, and 10 World Championships medals, including eight gold. Lewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper whose career spanned from 1979 to 1996, when he last won the Olympic long jump. He is one of six athletes to win gold in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games, and is one of two people to win gold in the same individual athletics event in four Olympic Games, along with USA discus thrower Al Oerter. He is the head track and field coach for the University of Houston.

Lewis topped the world rankings in the 100 m, 200 m and long jump events frequently from 1981 to the early 1990s. He set world records in the 100 m, 4 × 100 m and 4 × 200 m relays, while his world record in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984. His 65 consecutive victories in the long jump over a span of ten years is one of the sport&#x27;s longest undefeated streaks. Lewis broke 10 seconds for the 100 meters fifteen times and 20 seconds for the 200 meters ten times. He also long jumped over 71 times.

His accomplishments have led to numerous accolades, including being voted &quot;World Athlete of the Century&quot; by the International Association of Athletics Federations, &quot;Sportsman of the Century&quot; by the International Olympic Committee, &quot;Olympian of the Century&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Athlete of the Year&quot; by &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; in 1982, 1983, and 1984.

After retiring from athletics, Lewis became an actor and has appeared in a number of films. In 2011, he attempted to run for a seat as a Democrat in the New Jersey Senate, but was removed from the ballot due to the state&#x27;s residency requirement. Lewis owns a marketing and branding company named C.L.E.G., which markets and brands products and services including his own.

==Athletic career==

===Fame as a competitive athlete===

Frederick Carlton Lewis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on July 1, 1961, the son of William Lewis (1927–1987) and Evelyn née Lawler Lewis. His mother was a hurdler on the 1951 Pan-Am team. His elder brother Cleveland Lewis played professional soccer for the Memphis Rogues. His parents ran a local athletics club that provided a crucial influence on both him and his sister, Carol. She became an elite long jumper, finishing ninth at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships.

Lewis was initially coached by his father, who also coached other local athletes to elite status. At age 13, Lewis began competing in the long jump, and he emerged as a promising athlete while coached by Andy Dudek and Paul Minore at Willingboro High School in his hometown of Willingboro Township, New Jersey. He achieved the ranking of fourth on the all-time World Junior list of long jumpers.

Many colleges tried to recruit Lewis, and he chose to enroll at the University of Houston where Tom Tellez was coach. Tellez would thereafter remain Lewis&#x27;s coach for his entire career. Days after graduating from high school in 1979, Lewis broke the high school long jump record with a leap of . By the end of 1979, Lewis was ranked fifth in the world for the long jump, according to &quot;Track and Field News&quot;.

An old knee injury had flared up again at the end of the high school year, and this might have had consequences on his fitness. Lewis worked with Tellez and adapted his technique so that he was able to jump without pain, and he went on to win the 1980 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title with a wind-assisted jump of .

Though his focus was on the long jump, he was now starting to emerge as a talent in the sprints. Comparisons were beginning to be made with Jesse Owens, who dominated sprint and long jump events in the 1930s. Lewis qualified for the American team for the 1980 Olympics in the long jump and as a member of the 4 × 100 m relay team. The Olympic boycott precluded Lewis from competing in Moscow, Russia; he instead participated in the Liberty Bell Classic in July 1980, which was an alternate meet for boycotting nations. He jumped for a bronze medal, and the American 4 × 100 m relay team won gold with a time of 38.61 s. He received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created specifically for the athletes on the 1980 U.S. Summer Olympics team. At year&#x27;s end, he was ranked sixth in the world in the long jump and seventh in the 100 m.

===Breakthrough in 1981 and 1982===
At the start of 1981, Lewis&#x27;s best legal long jump was his high school record from 1979. On June 20, Lewis improved his personal best by almost half a meter by leaping at the TAC Championships while still a teenager.

While marks set at the thinner air of high altitude are eligible for world records, Lewis was determined to set his records at sea level. In response to a question about his skipping a 1982 long jump competition at altitude, he said, &quot;I want the record and I plan to get it, but not at altitude. I don&#x27;t want that &#x27;(A)&#x27; [for altitude] after the mark.&quot; When he gained prominence in the early 1980s, all the extant men&#x27;s 100 m and 200 m records and the long jump record had been set at the high altitude of Mexico City.

Also in 1981, Lewis became the fastest 100 m sprinter in the world. His relatively modest best from 1979 (10.67 s) improved to a world-class 10.21 the next year. But 1981 saw him run 10.00 s at the Southwest Conference Championships in Dallas on May 16, a time that was the third-fastest in history and stood as the low-altitude record. For the first time, Lewis was ranked number one in the world, in both the 100 m and the long jump. He won his first national titles in the 100 m and long jump. Additionally, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States.

In 1982, Lewis continued his dominance, and for the first time it seemed someone might challenge Bob Beamon&#x27;s world record of in the long jump set at the 1968 Olympics, a mark often described as one of the greatest athletic achievements ever. Before Lewis, had been exceeded on two occasions by two people: Beamon and 1980 Olympic champion Lutz Dombrowski. During 1982, Lewis cleared five times outdoors, twice more indoors, going as far as at Indianapolis on July 24. He also ran 10.00 s in the 100 m, the world&#x27;s fastest time, matching his low-altitude record from 1981. He achieved his 10.00 s clocking the same weekend he leapt twice, and the day he recorded his new low-altitude record at Indianapolis, he had three fouls with his toe barely over the board, two of which seemed to exceed Beamon&#x27;s record, the third which several observers said reached . Lewis said he should have been credited with that jump, claiming the track officials misinterpreted the rules on fouls.

He repeated his number one ranking in the 100 m and long jump, and ranked number six in the 200 m. Additionally, he was named Athlete of the Year by &quot;Track and Field News&quot;. From 1981 until 1992, Lewis topped the 100 m ranking six times (seven if Ben Johnson&#x27;s 1987 top ranking is ignored), and ranked no lower than third. His dominance in the long jump was even greater, as he topped the rankings nine times during the same period, and ranked second in the other years.

===1983 and the inaugural World Championships===
The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the governing body of track and field, organized the first World Championships in 1983. Lewis&#x27; chief rival in the long jump was predicted to be the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks. But though Myricks had joined Lewis in surpassing the year before, he failed to qualify for the American team, and Lewis won at Helsinki with relative ease. His winning leap of defeated silver medalist Jason Grimes by .

He also won the 100 m with relative ease. There, Calvin Smith who had earlier that year set a new world record in the 100 m at altitude with a 9.93 s performance, was soundly beaten by Lewis 10.07 s to 10.21 s. Smith won the 200 m title, an event which Lewis had not entered, but even there he was partly in Lewis&#x27; shadow as Lewis had set an American record in that event earlier that year. He won the 200 m on June 19 at the TAC/Mobil Championships in 19.75 s, the second-fastest time in history and the low-altitude record, only 0.03 s behind Pietro Mennea&#x27;s 1979 mark. Observers here noted that Lewis probably could have broken the world record if he did not ease off in the final meters to raise his arms in celebration. Finally, Lewis ran the anchor in the 4 × 100 m relay, winning in 37.86 s, a new world record and the first in Lewis&#x27; career.

Lewis&#x27; year-best performances in the 100 m and long jump were not at the World Championships, but at other meets. He became the first person to run a sub-10 second 100 m at low-altitude with a 9.97 s in Modesto on May 14. His gold at the World Championships and his other fast times earned him the number one ranking in the world that year, despite Calvin Smith&#x27;s world record. At the TAC Championships on June 19, he set a new low-altitude record in the long jump, and earned the world number one ranking in that event. &quot;Track and Field News&quot; ranked him number two in the 200 m, despite his low-altitude record of 19.75 s, behind Smith, who had won gold at Helsinki. Lewis was again named Athlete of the Year by the magazine.

===1984 Summer Olympics: emulating Jesse Owens===

At the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Lewis was entered into four events with realistic prospects of winning each of them and thereby matching the achievement of Jesse Owens at the 1936 Games in Berlin.

Lewis started his quest to match Owens with a convincing win in the 100 m, running 9.99 s to defeat his nearest competitor, fellow American Sam Graddy, by 0.2 s. In his next event, the long jump, Lewis won with relative ease. His behavior in winning this event stoked controversy, even as knowledgeable observers agreed that his tactics were correct. Since Lewis still had heats and finals in the 200 m and the 4 × 100 m relay to compete in, he chose to take as few jumps as necessary to win the event. He risked injury in the cool conditions of the day if he over-extended himself, and his ultimate goal to win four golds might be at risk. He knew that his first jump at was sufficient to win the event. He fouled on his next jump and then passed on his remaining four allotted jumps. Lewis easily won gold, and Gary Honey of Australia settled for the silver medal with a jump of . The public was generally unaware of the intricacies of the sport and had been repeatedly told by the media of Lewis&#x27;s quest to surpass Bob Beamon&#x27;s legendary long jump record of . Lewis himself had often stated it was a goal of his to surpass the mark. A television advertisement with Beamon appeared before the final, featuring the record-holder saying, &quot;I hope you make it, kid.&quot; So, when Lewis decided not to make any more attempts to try to break the record, he was loudly booed. When asked about those boos, Lewis said, &quot;I was shocked at first. But after I thought about it, I realized that they were booing because they wanted to see more of Carl Lewis. I guess that&#x27;s flattering.&quot;

His third gold medal came in the 200 m, where he won with a time of 19.80 s, a new Olympic record and the third fastest time in history. Finally, he won his fourth gold in the 4 × 100 m relay when he anchored the final leg of the race; he broke the tape with a time of 37.83 s, setting a new world record.

====Lack of endorsements and public perception====
Although Lewis had achieved what he had set out to do, matching Jesse Owens&#x27; feat of winning four gold medals in the same events at a single Olympic Games, he did not receive the lucrative endorsement offers that he had expected. The long jump controversy was one reason and his self-congratulatory conduct did not impress several other track stars. Further, Lewis&#x27;s agent Joe Douglas compared him to pop star Michael Jackson, a comparison which did not go over well. Douglas said he was inaccurately quoted, but the impression that Lewis was aloof and egotistical was firmly planted in the public&#x27;s perception by the end of the 1984 Olympic Games.

Additionally, rumors circulated at that time that Lewis was gay. Although he denied the rumors, it likely hurt his marketability. Lewis&#x27; physical appearance at the Games, with a flattop haircut and flamboyant clothing, added fuel to the reports. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter what Carl Lewis&#x27; sexuality is&quot;, high jumper Dwight Stones said. &quot;Madison Avenue perceives him as homosexual.&quot; Coca-Cola had offered a lucrative deal to Lewis before the Olympics, but Lewis and Douglas turned it down, confident that Lewis would be worth more after the Olympics. But Coca-Cola rescinded the offer after the Games. Nike already had Lewis under contract for several years, despite questions about how it affected his amateur status, and he was appearing in Nike television advertisements in print and on billboards. Nike was faced with Lewis&#x27;s new negative image and dropped him after the Games. &quot;If you&#x27;re a male athlete, I think the American public wants you to look macho&quot;, said Don Coleman, a Nike representative. &quot;They started looking for ways to get rid of me&quot;, Lewis said. &quot;Everyone there was so scared and so cynical they did not know what to do.&quot; Lewis and Nike eventually did split, and Lewis signed an endorsement deal with Mizuno. Lewis himself would lay the blame on some inaccurate reporting, especially the &quot;Carl bashing&quot;, as he put it, typified by a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article before the Olympics.

At year&#x27;s end, Lewis was again awarded the top rankings in the 100 m and the long jump and was additionally ranked number one in the 200 m, and for the third year in a row he was awarded the Athlete of the Year title by &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot;.

The Chicago Bulls drafted Lewis in the 1984 NBA draft as the 208th overall pick, although he had played neither high school nor college basketball. Lewis never played in the NBA. A poll on the NBA&#x27;s website ranked Lewis second to Lusia Harris, the only woman to be drafted by the NBA, as the most unusual pick in the history of the NBA Draft. Ron Weiss, the head West Coast scout of the Bulls, and Ken Passon, the assistant West Coast scout, recommended Lewis because he was the best athlete available. Similarly, Lewis was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys as a wide receiver in the 12th round of the 1984 NFL draft, even though he did not play football in college. He never played in the NFL either.

===Ben Johnson and the 1987 World Championships===
After the 1984 Olympics, Lewis continued to dominate track and field, especially in the long jump, in which he would remain undefeated for the next seven years, but others started to challenge his dominance in the 100 m sprint. His low-altitude record had been surpassed by fellow American Mel Lattany with a time of 9.96 s shortly before the 1984 Olympics, but his biggest challenger would prove to be Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics. Johnson would beat Lewis once in 1985, but Lewis also lost to others, while winning most of his races. Lewis retained his number one rank that year; Johnson would place second. In 1986, Johnson defeated Lewis convincingly at the Goodwill Games in Moscow, clocking a new low-altitude record of 9.95 s. At year&#x27;s end, Johnson was ranked number one, while Lewis slipped to number three, having lost more races than he won. He even seemed vulnerable in the long jump, an event he did not lose in 1986, or the year before, though he competed sparingly. Lewis ended up ranked second behind Soviet Robert Emmiyan, who had the longest legal jump of the year at .

At the 1987 World Championships in Athletics in Rome, Lewis skipped the 200 m to focus on his strongest event, the long jump, and made sure to take all his attempts. This was not to answer critics from the 1984 long jump controversy; this was because history&#x27;s second 29 ft long-jumper was in the field: Robert Emmiyan leapt at altitude in May, just 4 cm short of Bob Beamon&#x27;s record. But Emmiyan&#x27;s best that day was a leap of , second to Lewis&#x27; . Lewis cleared four times. 
In the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis anchored the gold-medal team to a time of 37.90 s, the third-fastest of all time.

The 100 m final was the most talked about event and caused the most drama. Johnson had run under 10.00 s three times in the year before Rome, while Lewis had not managed to get under the 10.00 s barrier at all. Lewis looked strong in the heats of the 100 m, setting a Championship record in the semi-final while running into a wind with a 10.03 s effort. In the final, however, Johnson won with a time that stunned observers: 9.83 s, a new world record. Lewis, second with 9.93 s, had tied the existing world record, but that was insufficient.

While Johnson basked in the glory of his achievement, Lewis started to explain away his defeat. He first claimed that Johnson had false-started, then he alluded to a stomach virus that had weakened him, and finally, without naming names, said &quot;There are a lot of people coming out of nowhere. I don&#x27;t think they are doing it without drugs.&quot; He added, &quot;I could run 9.8 or faster in the 100 if I could jump into drugs right away.&quot; This was the start of Lewis&#x27;s calling on the sport of track and field to eliminate the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs. His detractors noted that the problem had been in the sport for many years, and it only became a cause for Lewis once he was actually defeated. In response to the accusations, Johnson replied &quot;When Carl Lewis was winning everything, I never said a word against him. And when the next guy comes along and beats me, I won&#x27;t complain about that either&quot;.

===1988 Summer Olympics===
Lewis not only lost the most publicized showdown in track and field in 1987, he also lost his father. When William Lewis died of cancer at age 60, Lewis placed the gold medal he won for the 100 m in 1984 in his hand to be buried with him. &quot;Don&#x27;t worry&quot;, he told his mother. &quot;I&#x27;ll get another one.&quot; Lewis repeatedly referred to his father as a motivating factor for the 1988 season. &quot;A lot happened to me last year, especially the death of my father. That caused me to re-educate myself to being the very best I possibly can be this season&quot;, he said, after defeating Johnson in Zürich on August 17.

At the Olympic trials in Indianapolis, Lewis won the 100 m finals in 9.78 s, which appeared to be a new world record. However, the race was determined to have been wind-aided, so the record did not count.

The 100 m final at the 1988 Summer Olympics was one of the most sensational sports stories of the year and its unexpected outcome would rank as one of the most infamous sports stories of the century. In the Olympic finals, Johnson won in 9.79 s, a new world record, while Lewis set a new American record with 9.92 s. Three days later, Johnson tested positive for steroids, his medal was taken away and Lewis was awarded gold and credited with a new Olympic record.

In the long jump, Robert Emmiyan withdrew from the competition citing an injury, and Lewis&#x27;s main challengers were rising American long jump star Mike Powell and long-time rival Larry Myricks. Lewis leapt , a low-altitude Olympic best, and none of his competitors could match it. The Americans swept the medals in the event for the first time in 84 years. In the 200 m, Lewis dipped under his Olympic record from 1984, running 19.79 s, but did so in second place to Joe DeLoach, who claimed the new record and Olympic gold in 19.75 s. In the final event he entered, the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis never made it to the track as the Americans fumbled an exchange in a heat and were disqualified.

A subsequent honor would follow: Lewis eventually was credited with the 100 m world record for the 9.92 s he ran in Seoul. Though Ben Johnson&#x27;s 9.79 s time was never ratified as a world record, the 9.83 s he ran the year before was. However, in the fallout to the steroid scandal, an inquiry was called in Canada wherein Johnson admitted under oath to long-time steroid use. The IAAF subsequently stripped Johnson of his record and gold medal from the World Championships. Lewis was deemed to be the world record holder for his 1988 Olympic performance and declared the 1987 100 m World Champion. The IAAF also declared that Lewis had also, therefore, twice tied the &quot;true&quot; world record (9.93 s) for his 1987 World Championship performance, and again at the 1988 Zürich meet where he defeated Johnson. However, those times were never ratified as records. From January 1, 1990, Lewis was the world record holder in the 100 m. The record did not last long, as fellow American and University of Houston teammate Leroy Burrell ran 9.90 s on June 14, 1991, to break Lewis&#x27;s mark. Lewis also permanently lost his ranking as number one for the 200 m in 1988 and for the 100 m in 1989. He also lost the top ranking for the long jump in 1990 but was able to regain it in 1992.

===1991 World Championships: Lewis&#x27; greatest performances===
Tokyo was the venue for the 1991 World Championships. In the 100 m final, Lewis faced the two men who ranked number one in the world the past two years: Burrell and Jamaican Raymond Stewart. In what would be the deepest 100 meters race ever to that time, with six men finishing in under ten seconds, Lewis not only defeated his opponents, he reclaimed the world record with a clocking of 9.86 s. Though previously a world-record holder in this event, this was the first time he had crossed the line with &quot;WR&quot; beside his name on the giant television screens, and the first time he could savor his achievement at the moment it occurred. He could be seen with tears in his eyes afterwards. &quot;The best race of my life&quot;, Lewis said. &quot;The best technique, the fastest. And I did it at thirty.&quot; Lewis&#x27;s world record would stand for nearly three years. Lewis also anchored the 4 × 100 m relay team to another world record, 37.50 s, the third time that year he had anchored a 4 × 100 m squad to a world record.

====Long jump showdown versus Powell====
The 1991 World Championships are perhaps best remembered for the long jump final, considered by some to have been one of the greatest competitions ever in any sport. Lewis was up against his main rival of the last few years, Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990. Lewis had at that point not lost a long jump competition in a decade, winning the 65 consecutive meets in which he competed. Powell had been unable to defeat Lewis, despite sometimes putting in jumps near world-record territory, only to see them ruled fouls or, as with other competitors such as Larry Myricks, putting in leaps that Lewis himself had only rarely surpassed, only to see Lewis surpass them on his next or final attempt.

Lewis&#x27; first jump was , a World Championship record, and a mark bested by only three others beside Lewis all-time. Powell, jumping first, had faltered in the first round, but jumped to claim second place in the second round. Lewis jumped , a wind-aided leap, in the third round, a mark that would have won all but two long jump competitions in history. Powell responded with a long foul, estimated to be around . Lewis&#x27;s next jump made history: the first leap ever beyond Bob Beamon&#x27;s record. The wind gauge indicated the jump was wind-aided, so it could not be considered a record, but it would still count in the competition. was the greatest leap ever under any condition.

In the next round, Powell responded. His jump was measured as ; this time, his jump was not a foul, and with a wind gauge measurement of 0.3 m/s, well within the legal allowable for a record. Powell had not only jumped 4 cm further than Lewis, he had eclipsed the 23-year-old mark set by Bob Beamon and done so at low altitude. Lewis still had two jumps left, although he was now no longer chasing Beamon, but Powell. He leaped , which was a new personal best under legal wind conditions, then a final jump of . He thus lost his first long jump competition in a decade. Powell&#x27;s and Lewis&#x27;s final two jumps still stand as of July 2024 as the top three low altitude jumps ever. The farthest anyone has jumped since under legal conditions is .

Lewis&#x27; reaction to what was one of the greatest competitions ever in the sport was to offer acknowledgment of the achievement of Powell. &quot;He just did it&quot;, Lewis said of Powell&#x27;s winning jump. &quot;It was that close, and it was the best of his life.&quot; Powell did jump as far or farther on two subsequent occasions, though both were wind-aided jumps at altitude: in 1992 and in 1994. Lewis&#x27;s best subsequent results were two wind-aided leaps at , and an under legal conditions while in the qualifying rounds at the Barcelona Olympics.

In reference to his efforts at the 1991 World Championships, Lewis said, &quot;This has been the greatest meet that I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; &quot;Track and Field News&quot; was prepared to go even further than that, suggesting that after these Championships, &quot;It had become hard to argue that he is not the greatest athlete ever to set foot on track or field.&quot; Lewis&#x27;s 1991 outstanding results earned him the ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year, an award he shared with gymnastics star Kim Zmeskal.

===Final years and retirement===

After the heights reached in 1991, Lewis started to lose his dominance in both the sprints and the long jump. Though he anchored a world record 1:19.11 in the rarely run 4 × 200 m relay with the Santa Monica Track Club early in 1992, he failed to qualify for the Olympic team in the 100 m or 200 m. In the latter race, he finished fourth at the Olympic trials behind rising star Michael Johnson who set a personal best of 19.79 s. It was the first time the two had ever met on the track. Lewis did, however, qualify for the long jump, finishing second behind Powell, and was eligible for the 4 × 100 m relay team. At the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, Lewis jumped in the first round of the long jump, beating Powell who did a final-round . In the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis anchored another world record, in 37.40 s, a time which stood for 16 years. He covered the final leg in 9.85 seconds, the fastest officially recorded anchor leg.

Lewis competed at the 4th World Championships in Stuttgart in 1993, but finished fourth in the 100 m, and did not compete in the long jump. He did, however, earn his first World Championship medal in the 200 m, a bronze with his 19.99 s performance. That medal would prove to be his final Olympic or World Championship medal in a running event. Injuries kept Lewis largely sidelined for the next few years, then he made a comeback for the 1996 season.

In 1996, Lewis qualified for the Olympic team in the long jump for the fifth time, the first time an American man has done so. At the 1996 Olympics, injuries to world-record holder Mike Powell and the leading long-jumper in the world, Iván Pedroso, affected their performances. Lewis, on the other hand, was in good form. Though he did not match past performances, his third-round leap of won gold by over second-place finisher James Beckford of Jamaica. He became the third Olympian to win the same individual event four times, joining Danish sailor Paul Elvstrøm and American discus thrower Al Oerter; the three would be joined by American swimmer Michael Phelps in 2016 and swimmer Katie Ledecky in 2024. Lewis&#x27;s nine gold medals also tie him for second on the list of multiple Olympic gold medalists with Paavo Nurmi, Larisa Latynina,Mark Spitz and Katie Ledecky behind Phelps.

Lewis&#x27; jump was also officially declared tied with Larry Myricks for the masters record for the 35–39 age group.

Controversy struck when, as &quot;Track and Field News&quot; put it, &quot;Lewis&#x27; attitude in the whole relay hoo-hah a few days later served only to take the luster off his final gold.&quot; After Lewis&#x27;s unexpected long jump gold, it was noted that he could become the athlete with the most Olympic gold medals if he entered the 4 × 100 m relay team. Any member of the American Olympic men&#x27;s track and field team could be used, even if they had not qualified for the relay event. Lewis said, &quot;If they asked me, I&#x27;d run it in a second. But they haven&#x27;t asked me to run it.&quot; He further suggested on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; that viewers phone the United States Olympic Committee to weigh in on the situation. Lewis had skipped the mandatory relay training camp and demanded to run the anchor leg, which added to the debate. The final decision was to exclude Lewis from the team. Olympic team coach Erv Hunt said, &quot;The basis of their [the relay team&#x27;s] opinion was &#x27;We want to run, we worked our butts off and we deserve to be here. The American relay team finished second behind Canada.

Lewis retired from track and field in 1997.

==Drug testing exoneration==
In 2003, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee&#x27;s director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that revealed that some 100 American athletes had failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000, arguing that they should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics but were nevertheless cleared to compete. Before showing the documents to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Exum tried to use them in a lawsuit against USOC, accusing the organization of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against him and cover-up over the failed tests. His case was summarily dismissed by the Denver federal Court for lack of evidence. The USOC claimed his case &quot;baseless&quot; as he himself was the one in charge of screening the anti-doping test program of the organization and clarifying that the athletes were cleared according to the rules.

Lewis was among the named athletes and Exum&#x27;s documents revealed that at the 1988 Olympics trials he had three positive results on a combined test for pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. All were and are banned in sport due to their activity as stimulants, though at the time all three were available over-the-counter as dietary supplements or treatments for cold and allergy symptoms. The combined concentrations of these stimulants detected in the three successive tests were 2 ppm, 4 ppm and 6 ppm.

Lewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain &quot;ma huang&quot;, the Chinese name for &quot;Ephedra sinica&quot;, an ephedrine-bearing plant which was then marketed as a weight loss aid. Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.

The highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test. The acceptable level has been raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances. According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed in 2003 that &quot;These [levels] are what you&#x27;d see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.&quot;

Following Exum&#x27;s revelations the IAAF affirmed that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration. The federation also reviewed in 1988 the relevant documents with the athletes&#x27; names undisclosed and stated that &quot;the medical committee felt satisfied, however, on the basis of the information received that the cases had been properly concluded by the USOC as &#x27;negative cases&#x27; in accordance with the rules and regulations in place at the time and no further action was taken&quot;.

&quot;Carl did nothing wrong. There was never intent. He was never told &#x27;you violated the rules, said Martin D. Singer, Lewis&#x27;s lawyer, who also said that Lewis had inadvertently taken the banned stimulants in an over-the-counter herbal remedy. In an April 2003 interview, Lewis agreed that he tested positive three times in 1988 but he was let off as that was the normal practice in those times. &quot;The only thing I can say is I think it&#x27;s unfortunate what Wade Exum is trying to do&quot;, said Lewis. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what people are trying to make out of nothing because everyone was treated the same, so what are we talking about? I don&#x27;t get it.&quot;

==Career after retiring from athletics==

===Film and television===
Lewis has appeared in numerous films and television productions. Among them, he played himself in cameos in &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, &quot;Speed Zone&quot;, &quot;Alien Hunter&quot; and &quot;Material Girls&quot;. He made an appearance on &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;. He also played Stu in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Atomic Twister&quot;.

In 2011, Lewis appeared in the short documentary &quot;Challenging Impossibility&quot; which features the feats of strength demonstrated by the late spiritual teacher and peace advocate Sri Chinmoy.
Lewis also appeared in the film &quot;The Last Adam&quot; (2006).

In 2024, Lewis appeared in the fourth season of &quot;Mask Singer: Adivina quién canta&quot;, the Spanish version of &quot;Masked Singer&quot;, under the Panda mask. He was eliminated in the season premiere.

===Bid for New Jersey State Senate===
On April 11, 2011, Lewis filed petitions to run as a Democrat for the New Jersey Senate in the state&#x27;s 8th legislative district in Burlington County. Two weeks later he was disqualified by Lieutenant Governor and secretary of state Kim Guadagno, as he did not meet the state&#x27;s requirement that Senate candidates live in New Jersey for four years. Lewis appealed his decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals; the court initially granted his appeal but a few days later the court reversed itself and Lewis withdrew his name.

===Coaching===
As of 2024, Lewis serves as the head track and field coach at his alma mater, the University of Houston. He was elevated from assistant coach in 2023.

==Personal life==
Lewis has a son named Bakim aka Blew, who is a Director/ Videographer and lives in Houston, Texas.

Lewis became a vegan in 1990, during his late twenties, and has credited his outstanding 1991 results in part to his vegan diet. He has said that it is better suited to him because he can eat a larger quantity without affecting his athleticism, and he believes that switching to a vegan diet can lead to improved athletic performance.

At a 2019 Pan American Games news conference, and in the aftermath of the deadly El Paso and Dayton shootings, Lewis called thenU.S. President Donald Trump &quot;a racist who is prejudiced, misogynistic, who doesn&#x27;t value anyone outside of himself&quot;.

<text>Carlos Castaneda (December 25, 1925 – April 27, 1998) was an American anthropologist and writer. Starting in 1968, Castaneda published a series of books that describe a training in shamanism that he received under the tutelage of a Yaqui &quot;Man of Knowledge&quot; named don Juan Matus. While Castaneda&#x27;s work was accepted as factual by many when the books were first published, the training he described is now generally considered to be fictional.

The first three books—&quot;The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge&quot;, &quot;A Separate Reality&quot;, and &quot;Journey to Ixtlan&quot;—were written while he was an anthropology student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Castaneda was awarded his bachelor&#x27;s and doctoral degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles based on the work he described in these books.

At the time of his death in 1998, Castaneda&#x27;s books had sold more than eight million copies and had been published in 17 languages.

==Early life and education==
According to his birth record, Carlos Castañeda was born Carlos César Salvador Arana, on December 25, 1925, in Cajamarca, Peru, son of César Arana and Susana Castañeda. Immigration records confirm the birth record&#x27;s date and place of birth. Castaneda moved to the United States in 1951 and became a naturalized citizen on June 21, 1957. Castaneda studied anthropology and was awarded his bachelor&#x27;s and doctoral degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles

==Career==
Castaneda&#x27;s first three books—&quot;The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge&quot;, &quot;A Separate Reality&quot;, and &quot;Journey to Ixtlan&quot;—were written while he was an anthropology student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He wrote that these books were ethnographic accounts describing his apprenticeship with a traditional &quot;Man of Knowledge&quot; identified as &quot;don Juan Matus&quot;, an Indigenous Yaqui from northern Mexico. The veracity of these books was doubted from their original publication, and are considered to be fictional by a number of scholars. Castaneda was awarded his bachelor&#x27;s and doctoral degrees based on the work described in these books.

In 1974 his fourth book, &quot;Tales of Power&quot;, chronicled the end of the story of his apprenticeship with Matus. Despite published questions and criticism, Castaneda continued to be popular with the reading public, and subsequent publications appeared describing further aspects of his training with don Juan.

Castaneda wrote that don Juan recognized him as the new &quot;nagual&quot;, or leader of a party of seers of his lineage. He said Matus also used the term &quot;nagual&quot; to signify that part of perception which is in the realm of the unknown yet still reachable by man—implying that, for his own party of seers, Matus was a connection to that unknown. Castaneda often referred to this unknown realm as &quot;non-ordinary reality&quot;.

While Castaneda was a well-known cultural figure, he rarely appeared in public forums. He was the subject of a cover article in the March 5, 1973, issue of &quot;Time,&quot; which described him as &quot;an enigma wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a tortilla&quot;. There was controversy when it was revealed that Castaneda might have used a surrogate for his cover portrait. Correspondent Sandra Burton, apparently unaware of Castaneda&#x27;s principle of freedom from personal history, confronted him about discrepancies in his account of his life. He responded: &quot;To ask me to verify my life by giving you my statistics ... is like using science to validate sorcery. It robs the world of its magic and makes milestones out of us all.&quot; Following that interview, Castaneda completely retired from public view until the 1990s.

===Tensegrity===

In the 1990s, Castaneda once again began appearing in public to promote Tensegrity, described in promotional materials as &quot;the modernized version of some movements called magical passes developed by Indigenous shamans who lived in Mexico in times prior to the Spanish conquest&quot;.

Castaneda, with Carol Tiggs, Florinda Donner-Grau and Taisha Abelar, created Cleargreen Incorporated in 1995, whose stated purpose was &quot;to sponsor Tensegrity workshops, classes and publications&quot;. Tensegrity seminars, books, and other merchandise were sold through Cleargreen.

==Personal life==
Castaneda married Margaret Runyan in Mexico in 1960, according to Runyan&#x27;s memoirs. He is listed as the father on the birth certificate of Runyan&#x27;s son C.J. Castaneda, even though the biological father was a different man. In an interview, Runyan said she and Castaneda were married from 1960 to 1973; however, Castaneda obscured whether the marriage occurred, and his death certificate stated he had never been married.

==Death==
Castaneda died on April 27, 1998 in Los Angeles due to complications from hepatocellular cancer. There was no public service; he was cremated and the ashes were sent to Mexico. His death was unknown to the outside world until nearly two months later, on June 19, 1998, when an obituary, &quot;A Hushed Death for Mystic Author Carlos Castaneda&quot; by staff writer J. R. Moehringer appeared in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

===Castaneda&#x27;s students===
After Castaneda stepped away from public view in 1973, he bought a large multi-dwelling property in Los Angeles which he shared with some of his followers, including Taisha Abelar (formerly Maryann Simko) and Florinda Donner-Grau (formerly Regine Thal). Like Castaneda, Abelar and Donner-Grau were students of anthropology at UCLA. Each subsequently wrote a book about her experiences of Castaneda&#x27;s / don Juan&#x27;s teachings from a female perspective: &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Crossing: A Woman&#x27;s Journey&quot; by Taisha Abelar, and &quot;Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers&#x27; World&quot; by Florinda Donner. Castaneda endorsed both of these books as authentic reports of the sorcery experience of don Juan&#x27;s world.

Around the time Castaneda died, his companions Donner-Grau, Abelar and Patricia Partin informed friends they were leaving on a long journey. Amalia Marquez (also known as Talia Bey) and Tensegrity instructor Kylie Lundahl also left Los Angeles. Weeks later, Partin&#x27;s red Ford Escort was found abandoned in Death Valley. Luis Marquez, Bey&#x27;s brother, went to police in 1999 over his sister&#x27;s disappearance, but could not convince them that it merited investigation.

In 2003, Partin&#x27;s sun-bleached skeleton was discovered by a pair of hikers in Death Valley&#x27;s Panamint Dunes area and identified in 2006 by DNA testing. The investigating authorities ruled the cause of death as undetermined. However, Castaneda often talked about suicide, and associates believe the women killed themselves in the wake of Castaneda&#x27;s death.

== Reception ==
The veracity of these books, and the existence of don Juan, was doubted from their original publication, and there is now consensus among critics and scholars that the books are largely, if not completely, fictional. 

===Early responses===
In the early years after the publication of Castaneda&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge&quot; (1968), there was significant positive coverage and interest in his work. 

&quot;Time Magazine&quot; featured a review of &quot;The Teachings of Don Juan&quot; shortly after its publication. The review acknowledged the controversy and skepticism surrounding Castaneda&#x27;s account but highlighted the book&#x27;s allure, describing it as &quot;an extraordinary narrative.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a review that praised the book&#x27;s captivating storytelling and its portrayal of Don Juan as a &quot;remarkable, almost legendary figure.&quot; &quot;Life Magazine&quot; included a feature article on Castaneda and his experiences with Don Juan, describing the book as &quot;breathtaking&quot; and focusing on the intrigue of his shamanic journey.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewed the book positively, emphasizing its impact on readers and its exploration of consciousness and reality. The &quot;Saturday Review&quot; highlighted the vividness of Castaneda&#x27;s descriptions and his portrayal of Don Juan&#x27;s teachings as thought-provoking and transformative. &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; review of the book acknowledged Castaneda&#x27;s skill as a writer and his ability to create a sense of immersion in his narrative.

===Later responses===
The veracity of Castaneda&#x27;s work has been doubted since their original publication, even while reviewers praised the writing and storytelling. For example, while Edmund Leach praised &quot;The Teachings of Don Juan&quot; as &quot;a work of art,&quot; he doubted its factual authenticity. Anthropologist E. H. Spicer offered a somewhat mixed review of the book, highlighting Castaneda&#x27;s expressive prose and his vivid depiction of his relationship with don Juan. However, Spicer noted that the events described in the book were not consistent with other ethnographic accounts of Yaqui cultural practices, concluding it was unlikely that don Juan had ever participated in Yaqui group life. Spicer also wrote, &quot;[It is] wholly gratuitous to emphasize, as the subtitle does, any connection between the subject matter of the book and the cultural traditions of the Yaquis.&quot;

In a series of articles, R. Gordon Wasson, the ethnobotanist who made psychoactive mushrooms famous, similarly praised Castaneda&#x27;s work, while expressing doubts about its accuracy.

An early unpublished review by anthropologist Weston La Barre was more critical and questioned the book&#x27;s accuracy. The review, initially commissioned by &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, was rejected and replaced by a more positive review from anthropologist Paul Riesman.

Beginning in 1976, Richard de Mille published a series of criticisms that uncovered inconsistencies in Castaneda&#x27;s field notes, as well as 47 pages of apparently plagiarized quotes.

Those familiar with Yaqui culture also questioned Castaneda&#x27;s accounts, including anthropologist Jane Holden Kelley. Other criticisms of Castaneda&#x27;s work include the total lack of Yaqui vocabulary or terms for any of his experiences, and his refusal to defend himself against the accusation that he received his PhD from UCLA through deception.

===Modern perspectives===
According to William W. Kelly, chair of the anthropology department at Yale University:

I doubt you&#x27;ll find an anthropologist of my generation who regards Castaneda as anything but a clever con man. It was a hoax, and surely don Juan never existed as anything like the figure of his books. Perhaps to many it is an amusing footnote to the gullibility of naive scholars, although to me it remains a disturbing and unforgivable breach of ethics.

Sociologist David Silverman sees value in the work even while considering it fictional. In &quot;Reading Castaneda&quot; he describes the apparent deception as a critique of anthropology field work in general—a field that relies heavily on personal experience, and necessarily views other cultures through a lens. He said that the descriptions of peyote trips and the work&#x27;s fictional nature were meant to place doubt on other works of anthropology.

Donald Wiebe cites Castaneda to explain the insider/outsider problem as it relates to mystical experiences, while acknowledging the fictional nature of Castaneda&#x27;s work.

==Existence of Don Juan Matus==
Scholars have also debated &quot;whether Castaneda actually served as an apprentice to the alleged Yaqui sorcerer don Juan Matus or if he invented the whole odyssey.&quot; Castaneda&#x27;s books are classified as non-fiction by their publisher, although there is consensus among critics that they are largely, if not completely, fictional.

Castaneda critic Richard de Mille published two books—&quot;Castaneda&#x27;s Journey: The Power and the Allegory&quot; and &quot;The Don Juan Papers&quot;—in which he argued that don Juan was imaginary, based on a number of arguments, including that Castaneda did not report on the Yaqui name of a single plant he learned about, and that he and don Juan &quot;go quite unmolested by pests that normally torment desert hikers.&quot; &quot;Castaneda&#x27;s Journey&quot; also includes 47 pages of quotes Castaneda attributed to don Juan which were actually from a variety of other sources, including anthropological journal articles and even well known writers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and C. S. Lewis. In response, Castaneda was defended in a letter to the editor by inventor of Core Shamanism, Michael Harner. Walter Shelburne contends that &quot;the Don Juan chronicle cannot be a literally true account.&quot;

According to Jeroen Boekhoven, Castaneda spent some time with Ramón Medina Silva, a Huichol &quot;mara&#x27;akame&quot; (shaman) and artist who may have inspired the don Juan character. Silva was murdered during a brawl in 1971.

<text>Tatarstan, officially the Republic of Tatarstan, sometimes also called Tataria, is a republic of Russia located in Eastern Europe. It is a part of the Volga Federal District; and its capital and largest city is Kazan, an important cultural centre in Russia. The region&#x27;s main source of wealth is oil with a strong petrochemical industry.

The republic borders the oblasts of Kirov, Ulyanovsk, Samara and Orenburg, as well as the republics of Mari El, Udmurtia, Chuvashia and Bashkortostan. The area of the republic is , occupying 0.4% of the total surface of the country. As of the 2021 Census, the population of Tatarstan was 4,004,809.

Tatarstan has strong cultural, linguistic and ethnic ties with its eastern neighbour, Bashkortostan, which is also a republic of Russia.

The official languages of the republic are Tatar and Russian.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Tatarstan&quot; derives from the name of the ethnic group—the Tatars—and the Persian suffix &quot;-stan&quot; (meaning &quot;state&quot; or &quot;country&quot; of, an ending common to many Eurasian countries). Another version of the Russian name is &quot;&quot; (), which was official along with &quot;Tatar ASSR&quot; during Soviet rule.

Turkish sources use the form &quot;Tataristan&quot;, and occasionally in Tatar, it appears as &quot;Tatarıstan&quot; (Татарыстан).

== Geography ==
The republic is located in the center of the East European Plain, approximately east of Moscow. It lies between the Volga River and the Kama River (a tributary of the Volga), and extends east to the Ural Mountains.

Oak is the dominant tree species on 87% of the total area, followed by aspen, linden, birch, and Scots pine. The total forest cover has decreased from 51.2% to 17.1% over the last 300 years.

The Volga-Kama Nature Reserve is situated in Tatarstan.

== Administrative divisions ==
Tatarstan&#x27;s administrative and territorial divisions form 43 municipal districts and 2 urban districts (Kazan and Naberezhnye Chelny), as well as 39 urban settlements and 872 rural settlements.
The republic also recognises cities of republican significance, the list of which is established by the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan. The districts consist of cities of district significance, urban-type settlements and rural settlements with subordinate territories that make up the primary level in the system of administrative-territorial structure of the Republic. Cities of national significance can be geographically divided into districts in the city.

== History ==


=== Middle Ages ===
The earliest known organised state within the boundaries of Tatarstan was Volga Bulgaria (c. 700–1238). The Volga Bulgars had an advanced mercantile state with trade contacts throughout Inner Eurasia, the Middle East, and the Baltic, which maintained its independence despite pressure by such nations as the Khazars, the Kievan Rus, and the Cuman-Kipchaks. Islam was introduced by missionaries from Baghdad around the time of Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s journey in 922.

Volga Bulgaria finally fell to the armies of the Mongol prince Batu Khan in the late 1230s (see Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria). The inhabitants, a large amount of them killed and the rest mixing with the Golden Horde&#x27;s Kipchaks, became known as the Volga Tatars. In the 1430s, the region again became independent as the base of the Khanate of Kazan, a capital having been established in Kazan, up the Volga from the ruined capital of the Bulgars.

The Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the troops of Tsar Ivan the Terrible in the 1550s, with Kazan being taken in 1552. A large number of Tatars were forcibly converted to Christianity and were culturally Russified. Cathedrals were built in Kazan; by 1593 all mosques in the area were destroyed. The Russian government forbade the construction of mosques, a prohibition that was not lifted until the 18th century by Catherine the Great. The first mosque to be rebuilt under Catherine&#x27;s auspices was constructed in 1766–1770.

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, Tatarstan became a centre of Jadidism, an Islamic movement that preached tolerance of other religions. Under the influence of local Jadidist theologians, the Bulgars were renowned for their friendly relations with other peoples of the Russian Empire. However, after the October Revolution, religion was largely outlawed and all theologians were repressed.

=== 20th century ===

During the Civil War of 1918–1920 Tatar nationalists attempted to establish an independent republic (the Idel-Ural State, &quot;Idel&quot; being the name of the Volga in Tatar) along with the neighbouring Bashkirs. Initially supported by the Bolsheviks, the state existed up until March 1918, when high-ranking members of its parliament were arrested by the Bolsheviks (who had turned on the state and denounced it as bourgeois) before the official declaration of its constitution. The Soviets later set up the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which was established on 27 May 1920. The boundaries of the republic did not include a majority of the Volga Tatars. The Tatar Union of the Godless were persecuted in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s 1928 purges.
A famine occurred in the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1921–1922 as a result of the policy of war communism. The famine deaths of between 500,000 and 2 million Tatars in the Tatar ASSR and in the Volga-Ural region in 1921–1922 was catastrophic as half of the Volga Tatar population in the USSR died.

Starting in the 1960s, schools opened in Tatarstan that taught Russian as an official second language, as it was necessary in order to individually advance in the broader Soviet society. By the 1980s, few schools still taught the Tatar language.

=== Present day ===

On 30 August 1990, Tatarstan declared its sovereignty with the &quot;Declaration on the State Sovereignty of the Tatar Soviet Socialist Republic&quot; and in 1992 Tatarstan held a referendum on the new constitution, promoted by Tatarstan&#x27;s President Shaymiyev and supervised by Helsinki Commission staff. Parliament opposition revolved around the Russian faction Narodovlastie (People&#x27;s Power). Some 62% of those who took part voted in favour of the constitution, with ethnic Tatars supporting it much more than Russians. In the new constitution, Tatarstan is defined as a Sovereign State. However, the referendum and constitution were declared unconstitutional by the Russian Constitutional Court. Articles 1 and 3 of the Constitution as introduced in 2002 define Tatarstan as a part of the Russian Federation, removing the &quot;sovereignty&quot; term.

On 15 February 1994, the Treaty &quot;On Delimitation of Jurisdictional Subjects and Mutual Delegation of Authority between the State Bodies of the Russian Federation and the State Bodies of the Republic of Tatarstan&quot; and Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan (&quot;On Delimitation of Authority in the Sphere of Foreign Economic Relations&quot;) were signed. The power-sharing agreement was renewed on 11 July 2007, though with much of the power delegated to Tatarstan reduced.

On 20 December 2008, in response to Russia recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People organisation declared Tatarstan independent and asked for United Nations recognition. However, this declaration was ignored both by the United Nations and the Russian government. On 24 July 2017, the autonomy agreement signed in 1994 between Moscow and Kazan expired, making Tatarstan the last republic of Russia to lose its special status.

=== Ethnic groups ===


There are about 2 million ethnic Tatars and 1.5 million ethnic Russians in Tatarstan, along with significant numbers of Chuvash, Mari, and Udmurts, some of whom are Tatar-speaking. The Ukrainian, Mordvin, and Bashkir minorities are also significant. Most Tatars are Sunni Muslims, but a small minority known as Keräşen Tatars are Orthodox Christians, some of whom regard themselves as being distinct from other Tatars even though most Keräşen dialects differ only slightly from the Central Dialect of the Tatar language.

There is a fair degree of speculation as to the early origins of the different groups of Tatars, but most Tatars no longer view religious identity as being as important as it once was, and the religious and linguistic subgroups have intermingled considerably. Nevertheless, despite many decades of assimilation and intermingling, some Keräşen demanded and were awarded the option of being specifically enumerated in 2002. This has provoked great controversy, however, as many intellectuals have sought to portray the Tatars as homogeneous and indivisible. Although listed separately below, the Keräşen are still included in the grand total for the Tatars. Another unique ethnic group, concentrated in Tatarstan, is the Qaratay Mordvins.

==== Jews ====
Tatar and Udmurt Jews are special territorial groups of the Ashkenazi Jews, which started to be formed in the residential areas of mixed Turkic-speaking (Tatars, Kryashens, Bashkirs, Chuvash people), Finno-Ugric-speaking (Udmurts, Mari people) and Slavic-speaking (Russians) populations. The Ashkenazi Jews first appeared in Tatarstan in the 1830s. The Jews of Udmurtia and Tatarstan are subdivided by cultural and linguistic characteristics into two territorial groups: 1) Udmurt Jews (Udmurt Jewry), who lived on the territory of Udmurtia and the north of Tatarstan; 2) Tatar Jews, or Kazan Jews (Tatar Jewry or Kazan Jewry), who lived mainly in the city of Kazan and its agglomeration.

=== Languages ===
In accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, the two state languages of the republic are Tatar and Russian. According to the 2002 Russian Federal Law (&quot;On Languages of Peoples of the Russian Federation&quot;), the official script is Cyrillic. Linguistic anthropologist Dr. Suzanne Wertheim notes that &quot;some men signal ideological devotion to the Tatar cause by refusing to accommodate to Russian-dominant public space or Russian speakers&quot;, whilst women, in promoting &quot;the Tatar state and Tatar national culture, index their pro-Tatar ideological stances more diplomatically, and with linguistic practices situated only within the Tatar-speaking community... in keeping with normative gender roles within the Tatar republic.&quot;

=== Religion ===

 Islam was the most common faith in Tatarstan, adhered to by 53.8% of the estimated 3.8 million population. Most of the remaining population is either Russian Orthodox Christian or non-religious.

Established in 922, the first Muslim state within the boundaries of modern Russia was Volga Bulgaria from which the Tatars inherited Islam. Islam was introduced by missionaries from Baghdad around the time of Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s journey in 922. Islam&#x27;s long presence in Russia also extends at least as far back as the conquest of the Khanate of Kazan in 1552, which brought the Tatars and Bashkirs on the Middle Volga into Russia.

In the 1430s, the region became independent as the base of the Khanate of Kazan, a capital having been established in Kazan, 170 km up the Volga from the ruined capital of the Bulgars. The Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the troops of Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible in the 1550s, with Kazan being taken in 1552. Some Tatars were forcibly converted to Christianity and cathedrals were built in Kazan; by 1593, mosques in the area were destroyed. The Russian government forbade the construction of mosques, a prohibition that was not lifted until the 18th century by Catherine II.

In 1990, there were only 100 mosques, but by 2004 this number had risen to well over 1,000. as many as 1,398 religious organizations were registered in Tatarstan, of which 1,055 were Muslim. In September 2010, Eid al-Fitr as well 21 May, the day the Volga Bulgars embraced Islam, were made public holidays.

The Russian Orthodox Church is the second largest active religion in Tatarstan, and has been so for more than 150 years, with an estimated 1.6 million followers made up of ethnic Russians, Mordvins, Armenians, Belarusians, Mari people, Georgians, Chuvash and a number of Orthodox Tatars which together constitute 38% of the 3.8 million population of Tatarstan. On 23 August 2010, the &quot;Orthodox monuments of Tatarstan&quot; exhibition was held in Kazan by the Tatarstan Ministry of Culture and the Kazan Eparchy. At all public events, an Orthodox Priest is called upon along with an Islamic Mufti.

The Muslim Religious Board of Tatarstan frequently organizes activities, like the &#x27;Islamic graffiti Contest&#x27; which was held on 20 November 2011.

== Politics ==

Tatarstan&#x27;s unicameral State Council consists of 100 seats: fifty for representatives of the parties and fifty for deputies from the republic&#x27;s localities. The Chairman of the State Council is Farit Mukhametshin, who has served since 27 May 1998. The government is the Сabinet of Ministers. The prime minister of the Republic of Tatarstan is Alexei Pesoshin.

According to the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, the Rais can be elected only by the people of Tatarstan, but due to Russian federal law, this law was suspended for an indefinite term. The Russian law on the election of governors says they should be elected by regional parliaments and that the candidate for Rais can be presented only by the president of Russia.

In December 2022, regional lawmakers voted to change the title of the head of the republic from &quot;president&quot; to &quot;rais&quot; (an Arabic title for &quot;leader&quot;); lawmakers were expected to adopt new amendments to Tatarstan&#x27;s constitution so that it would be in line with the 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia and a federal law in 2021 which abolished regional presidencies. The title of president was seen as the last remaining symbol of federalism following the centralisation reforms under Vladimir Putin. Incumbent president Rustam Minnikhanov originally was to retain the title of president until his term expires in 2025 under transitional agreements, however he became Rais in February 2024.

=== Political status ===
The Republic of Tatarstan is a constituent republic of the Russian Federation. Most of the Russian federal subjects are tied with the Russian federal government by the uniform Federal Treaty (The contract expired in 2017), but relations between the government of Tatarstan and the Russian federal government are more complex and are precisely defined in the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan. The following passage from the Constitution defines the republic&#x27;s status without contradicting the Constitution of the Russian Federation:

== Economy ==
Tatarstan is one of the most economically developed regions of Russia. The republic is highly industrialised and ranks second to Samara Oblast in terms of industrial production per km2.

In 2021, Tatarstan&#x27;s gross regional product was €40 billion, while GRP per capita was €10,000.

The region&#x27;s main source of wealth is oil. Tatarstan produces 32 million tonnes of crude oil per year and has estimated oil reserves of more than 1 billion tons. Industrial production constitutes 45% of the Republic&#x27;s gross regional domestic product. The most developed manufacturing industries are petrochemical industry and machine building. The truck-maker KamAZ is the region&#x27;s largest enterprise and employs about one-fifth of Tatarstan&#x27;s workforce. Kazanorgsintez, based in Kazan, is one of Russia&#x27;s largest chemical companies. Tatarstan&#x27;s aviation industry produces Tu-214 passenger airplanes and helicopters. The Kazan Helicopter Plant is one of the largest helicopter manufacturers in the world. Engineering, textiles, clothing, wood processing, and food industries are also of key significance in Tatarstan.

Tatarstan consists of three distinct industrial regions. The northwestern part is an old industrial region where engineering, chemical, and light industry dominate. In the newly industrial northeast region with its core in the Naberezhnye Chelny–Nizhnekamsk agglomeration, major industries are automobile construction, the chemical industry, and power engineering. The southeast region has oil production with engineering under development. The north, central, south, and southwest parts of the republic are rural regions. The republic has huge water resources—the annual flow of rivers of the Republic exceeds . Soils are widely diverse, with fertile soils covering approximately one-third of the territory that contribute to successful agricultural production. The main agricultural exports from Tatarstan are wheat, barley, and peas. Due to the high development of agriculture in Tatarstan (it contributes 5.1% of the total revenue of the republic), forests occupy only 16% of its territory. The agricultural sector of the economy is represented mostly by large companies as Ak Bars Holding and &quot;Krasnyi Vostok Agro&quot;.

The republic has a highly developed transport network. It mainly comprises highways, railway lines, four navigable rivers — Volga (İdel), Kama (Çulman), Vyatka (Noqrat) and Belaya (Ağidel), and oil pipelines and airlines. The territory of Tatarstan is crossed by the main gas pipelines carrying natural gas from Urengoy and Yamburg to the west and the major oil pipelines supplying oil to various cities in the European part of Russia.

All of these are located in the capital city, Kazan.

== Public spaces ==
Tatarstan takes a unique participatory approach to the development of public spaces that has earned it recognition. The Tatarstan Public Spaces Development Programme aims to create spaces for meeting or recreation. The programme covers a wide spectrum of projects, including streets, squares, parks, river banks, pavilions, and sports facilities.

Since 2016 (and continuing until 2022), the Architecturny Desant Architectural Bureau in Kazan has improved public spaces in each of Tatarstan&#x27;s 45 municipal districts, from large cities to small villages. As of April 2019, the project had revamped 328 public spaces. By creating and rehabilitating public spaces, the programme aims to be a catalyst for positive social, economic, and environmental change.

One notable example is the &quot;Beach&quot; at Almetyevsk, which includes public swimming pools and a terrace. Other examples include an amphitheatre in Black Lake Park, Kazan; the Central Square in Bavly; a children&#x27;s playground in Bogatye Saby village, which has a unique wooden play structure; the Cube container centre in the green beach at Gorkinsko-Ometievsky forest, Kazan; and the square on Festival Boulevard, Kazan.

The programme used an innovative participatory design approach, which later became mandatory for similar projects across Russia. This approach partners specialists with local residents at every stage of the project, from development, to implementation, to the ongoing use of the space.

The Tatarstan Public Spaces Development Programme was announced as one of the six winners of the 2019 Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The jury was impressed by the programme&#x27;s systematic approach and involvement of residents to decide the future of each space.

Each public space expresses the unique identity of that particular place, tying in its history while incorporating traditional materials. Major goals of the projects include improving the quality of life for residents and improving the environment. The Arhitekturnyi Desant team aims to provide a high quality public space, no matter the size of the settlement, including quality design, infrastructure, and materials.

Spending on the public spaces projects is helping the local economy. The number of street furniture manufacturers in the area, for example, has increased from 12 to 75 since the programme started.

<text>The Colossus of Rhodes (; ) was a statue of the Greek sun god Helios, erected in the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name, by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it was constructed to celebrate the successful defence of Rhodes city against an attack by Demetrius I of Macedon, who had besieged it for a year with a large army and navy.

According to most contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood approximately 70 cubits, or high – approximately two-thirds of the height of the modern Statue of Liberty from feet to crown – making it the tallest statue in the ancient world. It collapsed during the earthquake of 226 BC, although parts of it were preserved. In accordance with the Oracle of Delphi, the Rhodians did not rebuild it. John Malalas wrote that Hadrian in his reign re-erected the Colossus, but he was mistaken. According to the Suda, the Rhodians were called Colossaeans (), because they erected the statue on the island.

In 653, an Arab force under Muslim general Mu&#x27;awiya I conquered Rhodes, and according to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Theophanes the Confessor, the statue was completely destroyed and the remains sold. 

Since 2008, a series of as-yet-unrealized proposals to build a new Colossus at Rhodes Harbour have been announced, although the actual location of the original monument remains in dispute.

==Siege of Rhodes==

In the late fourth century BC, Rhodes, allied with Ptolemy I of Egypt, prevented a mass invasion staged by their common enemy, Antigonus I Monophthalmus.

In 304 BC, a relief force of ships sent by Ptolemy arrived, and Demetrius (son of Antigonus) and his army abandoned the siege, leaving behind most of their siege equipment. To celebrate their victory, the Rhodians sold the equipment left behind for 300 talents and decided to use the money to build a colossal statue of their patron god, Helios. Construction was left to the direction of Chares, a native of Lindos in Rhodes, who had been involved with large-scale statues before. His teacher, the sculptor Lysippos, had constructed a bronze statue of Zeus at Tarentum.

==Construction==
Construction began in 292 BC. Ancient accounts, which differ to some degree, describe the structure as being built with iron tie bars to which bronze plates were fixed to form the skin. The interior of the structure, which stood on a white marble pedestal near the Rhodes harbour entrance, was then filled with stone blocks as construction progressed. Other sources place the Colossus on a breakwater in the harbour. According to most contemporary descriptions, the statue itself was about 70 cubits, or tall. Much of the iron and bronze was reforged from the various weapons Demetrius&#x27;s army left behind, and the abandoned second siege tower may have been used for scaffolding around the lower levels during construction.

Philo of Byzantium wrote in &quot;De septem mundi miraculis&quot; that Chares created the sculpture in situ by casting it in horizontal courses and then placing &quot;...a huge mound of earth around each section as soon as it was completed, thus burying the finished work under the accumulated earth, and carrying out the casting of the next part on the level.&quot;

Modern engineers have put forward a hypothesis for the statue&#x27;s construction, based on the technology of the time), and the accounts of Philo and Pliny, who saw and described the ruins.

The base pedestal was said to be at least in diameter, and either circular or octagonal. The feet were carved in stone and covered with thin bronze plates riveted together. Eight forged iron bars set in a radiating horizontal position formed the ankles and turned up to follow the lines of the legs while becoming progressively smaller. Individually cast curved bronze plates square with turned-in edges were joined by rivets through holes formed during casting to form a series of rings. The lower plates were in thickness to the knee and thick from knee to abdomen, while the upper plates were thick except where additional strength was required at joints such as the shoulder, neck, etc.

Archaeologist Ursula Vedder has proposed that the sculpture was cast in large sections following traditional Greek methods and that Philo&#x27;s account is &quot;not compatible with the situation proved by archaeology in ancient Greece.&quot;

==The standing Colossus (280–226 BC)==
After twelve years, in 280 BC, the statue was completed. Preserved in Greek anthologies of poetry is what is believed to be the genuine dedication text for the Colossus.

==Collapse (226 BC)==
The statue stood for 54 years until a 226 BC earthquake caused significant damage to large portions of Rhodes, including the harbour and commercial buildings, which were destroyed. The statue snapped at the knees and fell over onto land. Ptolemy III offered to pay for the reconstruction of the statue, but the Oracle of Delphi made the Rhodians fear that they had offended Helios, and they declined to rebuild it.

==Fallen state (226 BC to 653 AD)==
The remains lay on the ground for over 800 years and, even broken, they were so impressive that many travelled to see them.

The remains were described briefly by Strabo (64 or 63 BC – ), in his work Geography (Book XIV, Chapter 2.5). Strabo was a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian who lived in Asia Minor during the transitional period of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.
Strabo is best known for his work &quot;Geographica&quot; (&quot;Geography&quot;), which presented a descriptive history of people and places from different regions of the world known during his lifetime. Strabo states that:

Pliny the Elder (AD 23/24 – 79) was a Roman author, a naturalist and natural philosopher, a naval and army commander of the early Roman Empire, and a friend of emperor Vespasian. Pliny wrote the encyclopedic &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; (Natural History), which became an editorial model for encyclopedias. The &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; is one of the largest single works to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day and purports to cover the entire field of ancient knowledge. Pliny remarked:

==Destruction of the remains==
The ultimate fate of the remains of the statue is uncertain. Rhodes has two serious earthquakes per century, owing to its location on the seismically unstable Hellenic arc. Pausanias mentions in the &quot;Descriptio Graeciae&quot;, writing ca. 174, how the city was so devastated by an earthquake that the sibyl oracle foretelling its destruction was considered fulfilled. This means the statue could not have survived for long if it had ever been repaired. By the 4th century Rhodes was Christianized, so any further maintenance or rebuilding, if there ever was any before, on an ancient pagan statue is unlikely. The metal would probably have been used for coins and maybe also tools by the time of the Arab wars, especially during earlier conflicts such as the Sasanian wars.

The onset of Islamic naval incursions against the Byzantine Empire gave rise to a dramatic account of what became of the Colossus. In 653, an Arab force under Muslim general Mu&#x27;awiya I raided Rhodes, and according to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Theophanes the Confessor, the remains of the statue constituted part of the booty, being melted down and sold to a Jewish merchant of Edessa who loaded the bronze onto 900 camels. The same story is recorded by Bar Hebraeus, writing in Syriac in the 13th century in Edessa (after the Arab pillage of Rhodes): &quot;And a great number of men hauled on strong ropes which were tied around the brass Colossus which was in the city and pulled it down. And they weighed from it three thousand loads of Corinthian brass, and they sold it to a certain Jew from Emesa&quot; (the Syrian city of Homs).

Ultimately, Theophanes is the sole source of this account, and all other sources can be traced to him. As Theophanes&#x27; source was Syriac, it may have had vague information about a raid and attributed the statue&#x27;s demise to it, not knowing much more. Or the Arab destruction and the purported sale to a Jew may have originated as a powerful metaphor for Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s dream of the destruction of a great statue.

Given the likely previous neglect of the remains and various opportunities for authorities to have repurposed the metal, as well as the fact that, Islamic incursions notwithstanding, the island remained an important Byzantine strategic point well into the ninth century, an Arabic raid is unlikely to have found much, if any, remaining metal to carry away. For these reasons, as well as the negative perception of the Arab conquests, L.I. Conrad considers Theophanes&#x27; story of the dismantling of the statue as likely propaganda, like the destruction of the Library of Alexandria.

==Posture==

The harbour-straddling Colossus was a figment of medieval imaginations based on the dedication text&#x27;s mention of &quot;over land and sea&quot; twice and the writings of an Italian visitor who in 1395 noted that local tradition held that the right foot had stood where the church of St John of the Colossus was then located. Many later illustrations show the statue with one foot on either side of the harbour mouth with ships passing under it. References to this conception are also found in literary works. William Shakespeare&#x27;s Cassius in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (I, ii, 136–38) says of Caesar:

Shakespeare alludes to the Colossus also in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (V.5) and in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; (V.1).

&quot;The New Colossus&quot; (1883), a sonnet by Emma Lazarus written on a cast bronze plaque and mounted inside the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty in 1903, contrasts the latter with:

While these fanciful images feed the misconception, the mechanics of the situation reveal that the Colossus could not have straddled the harbour as described in Lemprière&#x27;s &quot;Classical Dictionary&quot;. If the completed statue had straddled the harbour, then the entire mouth of the harbour would have been effectively closed during the entirety of the construction, and the ancient Rhodians would not have had the means to dredge and re-open the harbour after construction was finished. Additionally, the fallen statue would have blocked the harbour, and since the ancient Rhodians did not have the ability to remove the fallen statue from the harbour, it would not have remained visible on land for the next 800 years, as discussed above. Even neglecting these objections, the statue was made of bronze, and engineering analyses indicate that it could not have been built with its legs apart without collapsing under its own weight.

Many researchers have considered alternative positions for the statue which would have made it more feasible for actual construction by the ancients. There is also no evidence that the statue held a torch aloft; the records simply say that after completion, the Rhodians kindled the &quot;torch of freedom&quot;. A relief in a nearby temple shows Helios standing with one hand shielding his eyes (as if saluting) and it is quite possible that the colossus was constructed in the same pose.
While scholars do not know what the statue looked like, they do have a good idea of what the head and face looked like, as it was of a standard rendering at the time. The head would have had curly hair, similar to the images found on contemporary Rhodian coins.

==Possible locations==

While scholars generally agree that anecdotal depictions of the Colossus straddling the harbour&#x27;s entry point have no historic or scientific basis, the monument&#x27;s actual location remains a matter of debate. As mentioned above the statue is thought locally to have stood where two pillars now stand at the Mandraki port entrance.

The floor of the Fortress of St Nicholas, near the harbour entrance, contains a circle of sandstone blocks of unknown origin or purpose. Curved blocks of marble that were incorporated into the Fortress structure, but are considered too intricately cut to have been quarried for that purpose, have been posited as the remnants of a marble base for the Colossus, which would have stood on the sandstone block foundation.
Archaeologist Ursula Vedder postulates that the Colossus was not located in the harbour area at all, but rather was part of the Acropolis of Rhodes, which stood on a hill that overlooks the port area. The ruins of a large temple, traditionally thought to have been dedicated to Apollo, are situated at the highest point of the hill. Vedder believes that the structure would actually have been a Helios sanctuary, and a portion of its enormous stone foundation could have served as the supporting platform for the Colossus.

==Modern Colossus projects==
In 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that a modern Colossus was to be built at the harbour entrance by the German artist Gert Hof leading a Cologne-based team. It was to be a giant light sculpture made partially out of melted-down weapons from around the world. It would cost up to €200 million.

In December 2015, a group of European architects announced plans to build a modern Colossus bestriding two piers at the harbour entrance, despite a preponderance of evidence and scholarly opinion that the original monument could not have stood there. The new statue, tall (five times the height of the original), would cost an estimated US$283 million, funded by private donations and crowdsourcing. The statue would include a cultural centre, a library, an exhibition hall, and a lighthouse, all powered by solar panels. No such plans were carried out, however, and the website for the project went offline.

<doc id="67147" wikidata="Q202745" url="?curid=67147" title="Neuro-linguistic programming">
<text>Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is a pseudoscientific approach to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy that first appeared in Richard Bandler and John Grinder&#x27;s book &quot;The Structure of Magic I&quot; (1975). NLP asserts a connection between neurological processes, language, and acquired behavioral patterns, and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. According to Bandler and Grinder, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, near-sightedness, allergy, the common cold, and learning disorders, often in a single session. They also say that NLP can model the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire them.

NLP has been adopted by some hypnotherapists as well as by companies that run seminars marketed as leadership training to businesses and government agencies.

No scientific evidence supports the claims made by NLP advocates, and it has been called a pseudoscience. Scientific reviews have shown that NLP is based on outdated metaphors of the brain&#x27;s inner workings that are inconsistent with current neurological theory, and that NLP contains numerous factual errors. Reviews also found that research that favored NLP contained significant methodological flaws, and that three times as many studies of a much higher quality failed to reproduce the claims made by Bandler, Grinder, and other NLP practitioners.

== Early development ==
According to Bandler and Grinder, NLP consists of a methodology termed &quot;modeling&quot;, plus a set of techniques that they derived from its initial applications. They derived many of the fundamental techniques from the work of Virginia Satir, Milton Erickson and Fritz Perls. Bandler and Grinder also drew upon the theories of Gregory Bateson, and Noam Chomsky (particularly transformational grammar).

Bandler and Grinder say that their methodology can codify the structure inherent to the therapeutic &quot;magic&quot; as performed in therapy by Perls, Satir and Erickson, and indeed inherent to any complex human activity. From that codification, they say, the structure and its activity can be learned by others. Their 1975 book, &quot;The Structure of Magic I: A Book about Language and Therapy&quot;, is intended to be a codification of the therapeutic techniques of Perls and Satir.

Bandler and Grinder say that they used their own process of modeling to model Virginia Satir so they could produce what they termed the Meta-Model, a model for gathering information and challenging a client&#x27;s language and underlying thinking. They say that by challenging linguistic distortions, specifying generalizations, and recovering deleted information in the client&#x27;s statements, the transformational grammar concept of surface structure yields a more complete representation of the underlying deep structure and therefore has therapeutic benefit. Also derived from Satir were anchoring, future pacing and representational systems.

In contrast, the Milton-Model—a model of the purportedly hypnotic language of Milton Erickson—was described by Bandler and Grinder as &quot;artfully vague&quot; and metaphoric. The Milton-Model is used in combination with the Meta-Model as a softener, to induce &quot;trance&quot; and to deliver indirect therapeutic suggestion.

Psychologist Jean Mercer writes that Chomsky&#x27;s theories &quot;appear to be irrelevant&quot; to NLP. Linguist Karen Stollznow describes Bandler&#x27;s and Grinder&#x27;s reference to such experts as namedropping. Other than Satir, the people they cite as influences did not collaborate with Bandler or Grinder. Chomsky himself has no association with NLP, with his work being theoretical in nature and having no therapeutic element. Stollznow writes, &quot;[o]ther than borrowing terminology, NLP does not bear authentic resemblance to any of Chomsky&#x27;s theories or philosophies—linguistic, cognitive or political.&quot;

According to André Muller Weitzenhoffer, a researcher in the field of hypnosis, &quot;the major weakness of Bandler and Grinder&#x27;s linguistic analysis is that so much of it is built upon untested hypotheses and is supported by totally inadequate data.&quot; Weitzenhoffer adds that Bandler and Grinder misuse formal logic and mathematics, redefine or misunderstand terms from the linguistics lexicon (e.g., nominalization), create a scientific façade by needlessly complicating Ericksonian concepts with unfounded claims, make factual errors, and disregard or confuse concepts central to the Ericksonian approach.

More recently, Bandler has stated, &quot;NLP is based on finding out what works and formalizing it. In order to formalize patterns I utilized everything from linguistics to holography ... The models that constitute NLP are all formal models based on mathematical, logical principles such as predicate calculus and the mathematical equations underlying holography.&quot; There is no mention of the mathematics of holography nor of holography in general in Spitzer&#x27;s, or Grinder&#x27;s account of the development of NLP.

On the matter of the development of NLP, Grinder recollects:

The philosopher Robert Todd Carroll responded that Grinder has not understood Kuhn&#x27;s text on the history and philosophy of science, &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;. Carroll replies: (a) individual scientists never have nor are they ever able to create &quot;paradigm shifts&quot; volitionally and Kuhn does not suggest otherwise; (b) Kuhn&#x27;s text does not contain the idea that being unqualified in a field of science is a prerequisite to producing a result that necessitates a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; in that field and (c) &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; is foremost a work of &quot;history&quot; and not an instructive text on &quot;creating&quot; paradigm shifts and such a text is not possible—extraordinary discovery is not a formulaic procedure. Carroll explains that a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; is not a planned activity, rather it is an outcome of scientific effort within the dominant paradigm that produces data that cannot be adequately accounted for within the current paradigm—hence a &quot;paradigm shift&quot;, i.e. the adoption of a new paradigm. In developing NLP, Bandler and Grinder were not responding to a paradigmatic crisis in psychology nor did they produce any data that caused a paradigmatic crisis in psychology. There is no sense in which Bandler and Grinder caused or participated in a paradigm shift. &quot;What did Grinder and Bandler do that makes it impossible to continue doing psychology ... without accepting their ideas? Nothing,&quot; argues Carroll.

=== Commercialization and evaluation ===
By the late 1970s, the human potential movement had developed into an industry and provided a market for some NLP ideas. At the center of this growth was the Esalen Institute at Big Sur, California. Perls had led numerous Gestalt therapy seminars at Esalen. Satir was an early leader and Bateson was a guest teacher. Bandler and Grinder have said that in addition to being a therapeutic method, NLP was also a study of communication and began marketing it as a business tool, writing that, &quot;if any human being can do anything, so can you.&quot; After 150 students paid $1,000 each for a ten-day workshop in Santa Cruz, California, Bandler and Grinder gave up academic writing and started producing popular books from seminar transcripts, such as &quot;Frogs into Princes,&quot; which sold more than 270,000 copies. According to court documents relating to an intellectual property dispute between Bandler and Grinder, Bandler made more than $800,000 in 1980 from workshop and book sales.

A community of psychotherapists and students began to form around Bandler and Grinder&#x27;s initial works, leading to the growth and spread of NLP as a theory and practice. For example, Tony Robbins trained with Grinder and utilized a few ideas from NLP as part of his own self-help and motivational speaking programmes. Bandler led several unsuccessful efforts to exclude other parties from using NLP. Meanwhile, the rising number of practitioners and theorists led NLP to become even less uniform than it was at its foundation. Prior to the decline of NLP, scientific researchers began testing its theoretical underpinnings empirically, with research indicating a lack of empirical support for NLP&#x27;s essential theories. The 1990s were characterized by fewer scientific studies evaluating the methods of NLP than the previous decade. Tomasz Witkowski attributes this to a declining interest in the debate as the result of a lack of empirical support for NLP from its proponents.

== Main components and core concepts ==
NLP can be understood in terms of three broad components: subjectivity, consciousness, and learning.

According to Bandler and Grinder, people experience the world subjectively, creating internal representations of their experiences. These representations involve the five senses and language. In other words, our conscious experiences take the form of sights, sounds, feelings, smells, and tastes. When we imagine something, recall an event, or think about the future, we utilize these same sensory systems within our minds Furthermore it is stated that these subjective representations of experience have a discernible structure, a pattern.

Bandler and Grinder assert that behavior (both our own and others&#x27;) can be understood through these sensory-based internal representations. Behavior here includes verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as effective or adaptive behaviors and less helpful or &quot;pathological&quot; ones. They also assert that behavior in both the self and other people can be modified by manipulating these sense-based subjective representations.

NLP posits that consciousness can be divided into conscious and unconscious components. The part of our internal representations operating outside our direct awareness is referred to as the &quot;unconscious mind&quot;.

Finally, NLP uses a method of learning called &quot;modeling&quot;, designed to replicate expertise in any field. According to Bandler and Grinder, by analyzing the sequence of sensory and linguistic representations used by an expert while performing a skill, it&#x27;s possible to create a mental model that can be learned by others.

== Techniques or set of practices ==
According to one study by Steinbach, a classic interaction in NLP can be understood in terms of several major stages including establishing rapport, gleaning information about a problem mental state and desired goals, using specific tools and techniques to make interventions, and integrating proposed changes into the client&#x27;s life. The entire process is guided by the non-verbal responses of the client. The first is the act of establishing and maintaining rapport between the practitioner and the client which is achieved through pacing and leading the verbal (&quot;e.g.&quot;, sensory predicates and keywords) and non-verbal behavior (&quot;e.g.&quot;, matching and mirroring non-verbal behavior, or responding to eye movements) of the client.

Once rapport is established, the practitioner may gather information about the client&#x27;s present state as well as help the client define a desired state or goal for the interaction. The practitioner pays attention to the verbal and non-verbal responses as the client defines the present state and desired state and any resources that may be required to bridge the gap. The client is typically encouraged to consider the consequences of the desired outcome, and how they may affect his or her personal or professional life and relationships, taking into account any positive intentions of any problems that may arise. The practitioner thereafter assists the client in achieving the desired outcomes by using certain tools and techniques to change internal representations and responses to stimuli in the world. Finally, the practitioner helps the client to mentally rehearse and integrate the changes into his or her life. For example, the client may be asked to envision what it is like having already achieved the outcome.

According to Stollznow, &quot;NLP also involves fringe discourse analysis and &#x27;practical&#x27; guidelines for &#x27;improved&#x27; communication. For example, one text asserts &#x27;when you adopt the &quot;but&quot; word, people will remember what you said afterwards. With the &quot;and&quot; word, people remember what you said before and after.&#x27;&quot;

== Applications ==
=== Alternative medicine ===
NLP has been promoted as being able to treat a variety of diseases including Parkinson&#x27;s disease, HIV/AIDS and cancer. Such claims have no supporting medical evidence. People who use NLP as a form of treatment risk serious adverse health consequences as it can delay the provision of effective medical care.

=== Psychotherapeutic ===
Early books about NLP had a psychotherapeutic focus given that the early models were psychotherapists. As an approach to psychotherapy, NLP shares similar core assumptions and foundations in common with some contemporary brief and systemic practices, such as solution focused brief therapy. NLP has also been acknowledged as having influenced these practices with its reframing techniques which seeks to achieve behavior change by shifting its &quot;context&quot; or &quot;meaning&quot;, for example, by finding the positive connotation of a thought or behavior.

The two main therapeutic uses of NLP are, firstly, as an adjunct by therapists practicing in other therapeutic disciplines and, secondly, as a specific therapy called Neurolinguistic Psychotherapy.

According to Stollznow, &quot;Bandler and Grinder&#x27;s infamous &quot;Frogs into Princes&quot; and their other books boast that NLP is a cure-all that treats a broad range of physical and mental conditions and learning difficulties, including epilepsy, myopia and dyslexia. With its promises to cure schizophrenia, depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and its dismissal of psychiatric illnesses as psychosomatic, NLP shares similarities with Scientology and the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR).&quot; A systematic review of experimental studies by Sturt &quot;et al.&quot; (2012) concluded that &quot;there is little evidence that NLP interventions improve health-related outcomes.&quot; In his review of NLP, Stephen Briers writes, &quot;NLP is not really a cohesive therapy but a ragbag of different techniques without a particularly clear theoretical basis ... [and its] evidence base is virtually non-existent.&quot; Eisner writes, &quot;NLP appears to be a superficial and gimmicky approach to dealing with mental health problems. Unfortunately, NLP appears to be the first in a long line of mass marketing seminars that purport to virtually cure any mental disorder ... it appears that NLP has no empirical or scientific support as to the underlying tenets of its theory or clinical effectiveness. What remains is a mass-marketed serving of psychopablum.&quot;

André Muller Weitzenhoffer—a friend and peer of Milton Erickson—wrote, &quot;Has NLP really abstracted and explicated the essence of successful therapy and provided everyone with the means to be another Whittaker, Virginia Satir, or Erickson? ... [NLP&#x27;s] failure to do this is evident because today there is no multitude of their equals, not even another Whittaker, Virginia Satir, or Erickson. Ten years should have been sufficient time for this to happen. In this light, I cannot take NLP seriously ... [NLP&#x27;s] contributions to our understanding and use of Ericksonian techniques are equally dubious. &quot;Patterns I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; are poorly written works that were an overambitious, pretentious effort to reduce hypnotism to a magic of words.&quot;

Clinical psychologist Stephen Briers questions the value of the NLP maxim—a &quot;presupposition&quot; in NLP jargon—&quot;there is no failure, only feedback&quot;. Briers argues that the denial of the existence of failure diminishes its instructive value. He offers Walt Disney, Isaac Newton and J.K. Rowling as three examples of unambiguous acknowledged personal failure that served as an impetus to great success. According to Briers, it was &quot;the crash-and-burn type of failure, not the sanitised NLP Failure Lite, i.e. the failure-that-isn&#x27;t really-failure sort of failure&quot; that propelled these individuals to success. Briers contends that adherence to the maxim leads to self-deprecation. According to Briers, personal endeavour is a product of invested values and aspirations and the dismissal of personally significant failure as mere feedback effectively denigrates what one values. Briers writes, &quot;Sometimes we need to accept and mourn the death of our dreams, not just casually dismiss them as inconsequential.&quot; Briers also contends that the NLP maxim is narcissistic, self-centered and divorced from notions of moral responsibility.

=== Other uses ===
Although the original core techniques of NLP were therapeutic in orientation their generic nature enabled them to be applied to other fields. These applications include persuasion, sales, negotiation, management training, sports, teaching, coaching, team building, public speaking, and in the process of hiring employees.

== Scientific criticism ==
In the early 1980s, NLP was advertised as an important advance in psychotherapy and counseling, and attracted some interest in counseling research and clinical psychology. However, as controlled trials failed to show any benefit from NLP and its advocates made increasingly dubious claims, scientific interest in NLP faded.

Numerous literature reviews and meta-analyses have failed to show evidence for NLP&#x27;s assumptions or effectiveness as a therapeutic method. While some NLP practitioners have argued that the lack of empirical support is due to insufficient research which tests NLP, the consensus scientific opinion is that NLP is pseudoscience and that attempts to dismiss the research findings based on these arguments &quot;[constitute]s an admission that NLP does not have an evidence base and that NLP practitioners are seeking a post-hoc credibility.&quot;

Surveys in the academic community have shown NLP to be widely discredited among scientists. Among the reasons for considering NLP a pseudoscience are that evidence in favor of it is limited to anecdotes and personal testimony that it is not informed by scientific understanding of neuroscience and linguistics, and that the name &quot;neuro-linguistic programming&quot; uses jargon words to impress readers and obfuscate ideas, whereas NLP itself does not relate any phenomena to neural structures and has nothing in common with linguistics or programming. In education, NLP has been used as a key example of pseudoscience.

== As a quasi-religion ==
Sociologists and anthropologists have categorized NLP as a quasi-religion belonging to the New Age and/or Human Potential Movements.

Medical anthropologist Jean M. Langford categorizes NLP as a form of folk magic; that is to say, a practice with symbolic efficacy—as opposed to physical efficacy—that is able to effect change through nonspecific effects (e.g., placebo). To Langford, NLP is akin to a syncretic folk religion &quot;that attempts to wed the magic of folk practice to the science of professional medicine&quot;.

Bandler and Grinder were influenced by the shamanism described in the books of Carlos Castaneda. Concepts like &quot;double induction&quot; and &quot;stopping the world&quot;, central to NLP modeling, were incorporated from these influences.

Some theorists characterize NLP as a type of &quot;psycho-shamanism&quot;, and its focus on modeling has been compared to ritual practices in certain syncretic religions. The emphasis on lineage from an NLP guru has also been likened to similar concepts in some Eastern religions. Aupers, Houtman, and Bovbjerg identify NLP as a New Age &quot;psycho-religion&quot;. Bovbjerg argues that New Age movements center on a transcendent &quot;other&quot;. While monotheistic religions seek communion with a divine being, this focus shifts inward in these movements, with the &quot;other&quot; becoming the unconscious self. Bovbjerg posits that this emphasis on the unconscious and its hidden potential underlies NLP techniques promoting self-perfection through ongoing transformation.

Bovbjerg&#x27;s secular critique echoes the conservative Christian perspective, as exemplified by David Jeremiah. He argues that NLP&#x27;s emphasis on self-transformation and internal power conflicts with the Christian belief in salvation through divine grace.

== Legal disputes ==
===Founding, initial disputes, and settlement (1979–1981)===
In 1979, Richard Bandler and John Grinder established the Society of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) to manage commercial applications of NLP, including training, materials, and certification. The founding agreement conferred exclusive rights to profit from NLP training and certification upon Bandler&#x27;s corporate entity, Not Ltd. Around November 1980, Bandler and Grinder had ceased collaboration for undisclosed reasons.

On September 25, 1981, Bandler filed suit against Grinder&#x27;s corporate entity, Unlimited Ltd., in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Cruz seeking injunctive relief and damages arising from Grinder&#x27;s NLP-related commercial activities; the Court issued a judgment in Bandler&#x27;s favor on October 29, 1981. The subsequent settlement agreement granted Grinder a 10-year license to conduct NLP seminars, offer NLP certification, and utilize the NLP name, subject to royalty payments to Bandler.

===Further litigation and consequences (1996–2000)===
Bandler commenced further civil actions against Unlimited Ltd., various figures within the NLP community, and 200 initially unnamed defendants in July 1996 and January 1997. Bandler alleged violations of the initial settlement terms by Grinder and sought damages of no less than US$10,000,000.00 from each defendant.

In February 2000, the Court ruled against Bandler. The judgment asserted that Bandler had misrepresented his exclusive ownership of NLP intellectual property and sole authority over Society of NLP membership and certification.

===Trademark revocation (1997)===
In December 1997, a separate civil proceeding initiated by Tony Clarkson resulted in the revocation of Bandler&#x27;s UK trademark of NLP. The Court ruled in Clarkson&#x27;s favor.

===Resolution and legacy (2000)===
Bandler and Grinder reached a settlement in late 2000, acknowledging their status as co-creators and co-founders of NLP and committing to refrain from disparaging one another&#x27;s NLP-related endeavors.

Due to these disputes and settlements, the terms &#x27;NLP&#x27; and &#x27;Neuro-Linguistic Programming&#x27; remain in the public domain. No single party holds exclusive rights, and there are no restrictions on offering NLP certifications.

The designations &quot;NLP&quot; and &quot;Neuro-linguistic Programming&quot; are not owned, trademarked, or subject to centralized regulation. Consequently, there are no restrictions on individuals self-identifying as &quot;NLP Master Practitioners&quot; or &quot;NLP Master Trainers.&quot; This decentralization has led to numerous certifying associations.

===Decentralization and criticism===
This lack of centralized control means there&#x27;s no single standard for NLP practice or training. Practitioners can market their own methodologies, leading to inconsistencies within the field. This has been a source of criticism, highlighted by an incident in 2009 where a British television presenter registered his cat with the British Board of Neuro Linguistic Programming (BBNLP), demonstrating the organization&#x27;s lax credentialing. Critics like Karen Stollznow find irony in the initial legal battles between Bandler and Grinder, considering their failure to apply their own NLP principles to resolve their conflict. Others, such as Grant Devilly, characterize NLP associations as &quot;granfalloons&quot;—a term implying a lack of unifying principles or a shared sense of purpose.

<text>Régine Deforges (15 August 1935 – 3 April 2014) was a French author, editor, director, and playwright. Her book &quot;La Bicyclette bleue&quot; was the most popular book in France in 2000 and it was known by some to be offensive and to others for its plagiarism, neither of which was proved.

== Life ==
Deforges was born in Montmorillon, Vienne, Deforges is sometimes called the &quot;High Priestess of French erotic literature&quot;. Deforges was the first woman to own and operate a publishing house in France. Over the years, she has been censored, prosecuted, and heavily fined for publishing &quot;offensive&quot; literature, beginning with Louis Aragon: &quot;Irene&#x27;s Cunt&quot;.

One of her novels, (&quot;The Blue Bicycle&quot;), published in 1981, was France&#x27;s biggest bestseller. In 2000, it was made into a television series. A story of love, obsession, and survival set during the turmoil of World War II, it developed into a successful series of seven books. &quot;La Bicyclette bleue&quot; would go on to cause a major international intellectual property court case. In the initial ruling, Deforges was found guilty of plagiarizing Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s famous novel Gone with the Wind. Deforges freely admitted that the first 70 pages were inspired by Mitchell&#x27;s novel but the whole book was 1200 pages long. She won her case on appeal, and the ruling ordering her to pay damages was reversed. She was formerly president of the Société des Gens de Lettres de France and a member of the Prix Femina jury. She lived in Paris.

Deforges transformed her home town into a &quot;City of Writing&quot;. It has had museums and bookshops with that theme since 2000. The idea that Montmorillon should be a Book town came from Deforges who was then a local councillor. The town had a history of paper-making and her idea received both local and international support. The old medieval quarter of the town attracted six million euros of funding and now brands itself as a book town.

<doc id="67152" wikidata="Q244744" url="?curid=67152" title="Socionics">
<text>In psychology and sociology, socionics is a pseudoscientific theory of information processing and personality types. It incorporates Carl Jung&#x27;s work on &quot;Psychological Types&quot; with Antoni Kępiński&#x27;s theory of information metabolism.

In contrast to the generally accepted views in personality psychology on age-related variability of the human psyche, socionics distinguishes 16 psychophysiological types (sociotypes) which it claims go unchanged throughout a person&#x27;s life. The existence of personality types is extremely controversial in modern personality psychology. 

Socionics was developed in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily by the Lithuanian researcher . The name &quot;socionics&quot; is derived from the word &quot;society&quot;, because believed that each sociotype has a distinct purpose in society.

The central idea of socionics is that information is intuitively divisible into eight categories, called information elements, which a person&#x27;s psyche processes using eight psychological functions. Each sociotype has a different correspondence between functions and information elements, which it posits results in different ways of handling information and distinct thinking patterns. One prevalent idea in socionics is the theory of intertype relations, which is based on the interaction of these functions between types.

Independent authors point to the insufficient empirical validity of socionics both in its basis and in its further development, as well as the practical absence of studies on socionics outside the former USSR. The Commission on Pseudoscience of the Russian Academy of Sciences has placed socionics among such well-known pseudosciences as astrology and homeopathy.

== Purpose ==

Socionics provides a means of predicting the character of relations and degree of business compatibility, information sharing and psychological compatibility of people before their joining in one collective group, i.e. to solve the &quot;inverse task&quot; of sociometry.

According to Aleksandr Bukalov and Betty Lou Leaver, socionics uses Jungian typology, informational model of psyche, and theory of information metabolism for political and sociological analysis.

According to G. Fink and B. Mayrhofer, socionics is considered one of the four most popular models of personality (including cybernetic theory Maruyama, five-factor model, &quot;Big Five&quot; and the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator aka MBTI), deserving special attention because of its importance in the study of personality.

According to J. Horwood, and A. Maw, socionics is a science developed by in the 1970s. and her colleagues worked with Carl Jung&#x27;s personality typologies to develop personality-based relationship profiles. It was found that the nature and development of interpersonal relationships (both professional and personal) are far from random. Instead, they are based on how well suited each individual&#x27;s psychological profiles are to one another, allowing to develop 16 &#x27;socionic types&#x27; predicting and describing the interpersonal relationships between any combination of Jung&#x27;s personality types.

According to R. Blutner and E. Hochnadel, &quot;socionics is not so much a theory of personalities per se, but much more a theory of type relations providing an analysis of the relationships that arise as a consequence of the interaction of people with different personalities.&quot;

Philosopher L. Monastyrsky treats socionics as pre-science. At the same time, L. Monastyrsky himself proposes to pay attention to &quot;the concept of socionic type&quot;.

Philosopher E. Pletuhina defines socionics as the study about the information interaction of the human psyche with the outside world, between people. She also defines it as the doctrine of psychological types of people and the relationships between them, as well as notes that the particular quality of socionics is that it considers the innate qualities of the human psyche, including the personality type, which cannot be arbitrarily changed without prejudice to the mental and physical health.

==History==
The basic structure of socionics was established in the 1960s and 1970s by , along with a group of enthusiasts who met in Vilnius, Lithuania. What resulted from their discussions and &#x27;s personal investigations was an information model of the psyche and of interpersonal interaction based on Jung&#x27;s typology but with eight psychic functions rather than four. &#x27;s first works on socionics were published between 1978 and 1980.

=== Socionics as an academic discipline ===

Through the work of the International Institute of Socionics and other schools of socionics, there are four scientific peer-reviewed journals (on the practical application of the methods of socionics in management, consulting, psychology, pedagogy, education, psychotherapy, and humanities) and an annual International conference on socionics. The Institute gives &quot;popularization and proliferation of socionic knowledge&quot; as one of its goals.

Svetlana V. Ivanova notes that socionics is taught in more than 150 universities in Russia, Ukraine and other CIS and European Union countries. Some universities in Russia (including Altai State Technical University, Bashkir State University,
Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University, 
and Saint Petersburg State University)
Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania, have published or commissioned a number of textbooks and monographs on socionics, or on psychology, pedagogy and management, which socionics and its methods are devoted to specific topics.

Areas of research include educational socionics, sociological socionics, aviation socionics, library socionics, technical socionics, linguistic socionics, penitentiary socionics, and socionics in other subject areas.

Socionics is used in education, not only as a tool for teachers to manage the learning process, but also as a basis for the development and improvement of education and training. Bogdanova claim that a teacher holding socionic knowledge and technologies can consciously collaborate with others and improve professional efficiency. Targeted use of intertype relations helps intensify the didactic process, increase the motivation of students. Socionics is also used to assess the individual psychological and personal qualities to forecast the success of employee career.

Izmailova and Kiseleva found socionics interesting to be applied in advertising and marketing, because it allows you to explain the reasons for the behavior of consumers.

Socionics is a tool for the study of personality and creativity of the writer, the typology of the characters in his works. The method of linguistic-socionic modeling proposed by L. M. Komissarova, used for analysis of individual lexicon of language personality. A translation of socionic characteristics in verbal ones is called the &quot;method of linguistic-socionic modeling&quot; and widely used.

Socionic methods have been proposed for the modeling of information processes in the &quot;human-machine&quot; systems, and practically used to model systems &quot;aircraft operator&quot; in pilots&#x27; training, and other similar areas.

Due to the variety of applications of socionics, its concepts and information models, in the 1990s, Bukalov proposed to distinguish socionics of personality, or differential socionics, and generalized, more abstract integral socionics. Bukalov believes that the concept of information metabolism, cybernetic modeling and general systems theory extends beyond of psychology and sociology, and consider the relationship of technical information devices, and the types of information human interactions as operator with various technical and electronic management systems of major industries, including chemical, nuclear power stations, complex computer complexes with adaptive tunable to a specific operator interfaces.

===Propagation of socionics===

International Institute of Socionics lists a number of academic publications on socionics in English in peer-reviewed journals. Since 2000 socionics as a scientific discipline and a field of research has been recognized in Russia and Ukraine.

=== Pedagogical socionics ===

The concepts and methods of socionics are widely used in pedagogy, this collaboration creates a new scientific branch – pedagogical socionics.

Pletuhina noted that the parent, trainer or teacher, who knows the theory of socionics, who also understands an idea of the &quot;image of a socionics type&quot; and who can determine the child&#x27;s personality type with a sufficient degree of probability can use those opportunities of the individual approaches that socionics provides to raise and educate a child.

The role that socionics takes in the educational process is not limited to being a teacher&#x27;s tool for the managing process. It is also a base for development and improving the educational system and for preparing staff. Teachers armed with socionics technology can consciously establish relationships with other people and increase efficiency of their pedagogical skills. Rational implementation of intertype relationships can push educational process to become more intensive and increase students&#x27; motivation.

Socionics is also researched practical methods and techniques dedicated to evaluation person&#x27;s individual psychological values to prognoses professional success. Keneva, Marchenko, and Minaev argue that socionics might become a theoretical base for personal-oriented educational technologies.

=== Socionics in astronautics ===

In Star City conducted number of science seminars based on socionics methods and person typology to training space crews. Forming space crews by socionics methods was a central topic at the International conference on space researches, at the Space Forum 2011 and at the conference &quot;Piloted flights into Space&quot;.

=== Aviation socionics ===

According to order of the Ministry of transport of Russian Federation Flight Standards Department approved a default application &quot;Training of pilots in the field of human factor&quot;, which expects basic socionics knowledge not only among pilots and other crew members, but also prognosing interaction in air crews by socionics methods.

To improve interaction among crew members, specialists of Saint Petersburg University examined 2330 people by socionics methods, including university students; aircrews of airlines; air traffic controllers; professors from almost all flight academies of Russia; delegates from Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and Estonia.

This database represents result of 10 years of scientific work. In their research, authors are relying on fundamental works of the Kyiv School of Socionics, International Institute of Socionics, publications in journals &quot;Socionics, mentology and personal psychology&quot;, &quot;Management and personnel: management psychology, socionics and sociology&quot;.

According to the experimental results were obtained socionics and sociometric data of air traffic controllers and correlation analyses of its parameters, also was determined the connection&#x27;s intensity between person&#x27;s interaction levels. The practical values of this research is to develop automated module to determine individual characteristic of operators and to evaluate the effectiveness of socionics in the management of air traffic, particular in special cases of flight

==Jung&#x27;s psychological types==

Carl Jung describes four &quot;psychological functions&quot; that are capable of becoming applicable psychically, but to differing degrees in individuals:

* Sensation – all perceptions by means of the sense organs
* Intuition – perception by way of the unconscious, or perception of unconscious events
* Thinking (in socionics, Logic) – judgement of information based on reason
* Feeling (in socionics, Ethics) – judgement of information based on sentiment

In addition to these four types, Jung defines a polarity between introverted and extraverted personalities. This distinction is based on how people invest energy: either into the inner, subjective, psychical world (usually called , soul, by Jung), or toward their outer, objective, physical world (including one&#x27;s body).

By Jung&#x27;s rules, 16 psychological types exist. But in his book &quot;Psychological Types&quot; he described in detail only 8, distinguished by the 8 possible dominant functions. Contrary to Socionics and MBTI, Jung did not conclude that the types had two introverted functions and two extroverted functions. He instead outlined that extroverted personality types had a Dominant extroverted function, with the remaining functions being of varying if lower levels of development that range from being Inferior introverted functions that are necessarily retarded to auxiliary functions that lie in the middle.

==Information metabolism elements (often confused with memetics) ==
In socionics, Jung&#x27;s cognitive functions are always either introverted (focused on refining quality) or extroverted (focused on increasing quantity), and are referred to as &quot;information metabolism elements&quot; (IM Elements). These are said to process &quot;information aspects&quot;. To understand what an information aspect is, it is necessary to understand information metabolism as Augustinavičiūtė understood it.

 states that the human mind uses eight elements of information metabolism (mental functions) to perceive the world, and each of these eight elements reflect one particular aspect of objective reality. In her works she describes aspects of the world based on physical quantities such as potential and kinetic energy, space, time, and their properties.

Often, other socionists have equated these information elements with their definition and according to fundamental physical concepts as well (Matter-Time-Energy-Space).). Matter is compared to Thinking, Energy to Feeling, Space to Sensing, and Time to Intuition. Given the division of aspects of the absolute between Extroverted (&quot;black&quot;) and Introverted (&quot;white&quot;), being four times two, their number is eight.

The 8 socionics symbols ( ) were introduced by while working with Jung&#x27;s typology and remain the dominant method of denoting the functions and the corresponding information aspects that they process. Text-based notation systems are also used, such as Victor Gulenko&#x27;s 8 Latin letters (&#x27;P&#x27; for Pragmatism, &#x27;E&#x27; for Emotions, &#x27;F&#x27; for Force, &#x27;I&#x27; for Ideas, &#x27;L&#x27; for Laws, &#x27;R&#x27; for Relation, &#x27;S&#x27; for Senses, and &#x27;T&#x27; for Time, respectively), or Myers-Briggs notation (Te, Fe, Se, Ne, Ti, Fi, Si, and Ni, respectively).

==The 16 types==
 usually used names like &quot;sensory-logical introvert&quot; (SLI) to refer to the types. In SLI the leading function is introverted sensation and the creative function is extraverted logic. She also introduced the practice of referring to types by the name of a famous person of the type (although types of these persons are not universally agreed upon, with the old name &quot;Napoleon&quot; for the SEE being replaced by &quot;Caesar&quot; after being deemed an inaccurate type assignment). For example, she called the SLI &quot;Gabin&quot; and the SEI &quot;Dumas&quot;. Also sometimes names such as &quot;Craftsman&quot; or &quot;Mediator&quot; are used to express the social role of the type—a convention introduced by socionist Viktor Gulenko in 1995. Given the formal similarities present between Socionics and the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) abbreviations frequently used in English, some prefer to distinguish socionic type names from Myers–Briggs&#x27; names by writing the last letter (J or P) in lower case (for example, ENTp, ESFj)—a practice introduced by Sergei Ganin. This is because the relationship between socionics and Myers–Briggs and Keirseyan types is controversial.

Dmitri Lytov and Marianna Lytova state that &quot;main spheres of application of socionics are almost the same as for the Myers–Briggs Type Theory&quot;, and that observed differences in correlation &quot;represent characteristic stereotypes of the socionics and the Keirsey typology. Others state that MBTI and socionics &quot;correlate in roughly 30% of cases,&quot; and that &quot;there are many subtle differences&quot;. J and P in Socionics and Myers–Briggs are completely different: in Myers–Briggs, J and P stands for the &quot;first extraverted function&quot; (J—extraverted thinking or feeling, P—extraverted sensing or intuition); in Socionics, J and P stands for the &quot;first function&quot; (J—rational (thinking and feeling), P—irrational (sensing and intuition)). This formal conversion is carried out in accordance with the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator.

In dividing the socion according to the four Jungian dichotomies, from this is formed 16 socionic types. The following tables provide a list of types with the names most commonly used in socionics:

The second concept is the functional dimensions. It was introduced by Aleksandr Bukalov. He defined the first dimension as the personal experience (Ex), the second dimension as social norms (Nr), the third dimension as the current situation (St), and the fourth dimension as the globality, or time perspective (Tm). This concept is useful because it best illustrates the difference in cognitive power (imagine measuring capability of 2D v. 3D measuring tool) and roughly describes abilities of each function to process and generate information. Still, definitions of dimensions require further research and clarification. For example, the vulnerable function tends to lose knowledge which have not been used.

== Criticism ==

Psychophysiologist Sergey Bogomaz says there is no reason for considering socionics as a separate science. He considers socionic typology to be a Russian version of post-Jung typology, similar to the Myers-Briggs typology, but distinguished by a greater number of typological features and the formulation of prerequisites for the study of intertype relationships. Bogomaz considers the construction of the theory of intertype relationships to be an undoubted contribution of to the development of Jung typology, but criticized it by stating that there is little experimental data in socionics, there is no empirical verification of many claims, and by having many unsystematic pseudoscientific publications.

Philosopher L. M. Monastirsky identified the use of speculative categories as the first shortcoming of socionics. Secondly, he stated that it lacks clearly defined typing method and each socionics school defines methods of their own. At the same time Monastirsky, recognizing the potential of socionics, proposed to turn to the concept of a socionic type for carrying out some research in the field of the methodology of science.

An important issue in the field of socionics is the problem of convergence between type diagnoses of different analysts. Vladimir Ermak showed that ignorance of model A of the type of information metabolism leads to numerous mistakes in the definition of a socionic type. In the early 2000s, socionic analysts tried to develop more rigorous approaches to type diagnosis.

<text>Kamehameha I (; Kalani Paiʻea Wohi o Kaleikini Kealiʻikui Kamehameha o ʻIolani i Kaiwikapu kauʻi Ka Liholiho Kūnuiākea; to May 8 or 14, 1819), also known as Kamehameha the Great, was the conqueror and first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The state of Hawaii gave a statue of him to the National Statuary Hall Collection in Washington, D.C., as one of two statues it is entitled to install there.

==Birth and childhood==

===Paternity and family history===
Kamehameha (known as Paiʻea at birth), was born to Kekuʻiapoiwa II, the niece of Alapainui, the usurping ruler of Hawaii Island who had killed the two legitimate heirs of Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku during civil war. By most accounts he was born in Ainakea, Kohala, Hawaii. His father was Keōua Kalanikupuapa&#x27;ikalaninui; however, Native Hawaiian historian Samuel Kamakau says that Maui monarch Kahekili II had &quot;hānai&quot; adopted (traditional, informal adoption) Kamehameha at birth, as was the custom of the time. Kamakau believes this is why Kahekili II is often referred to as Kamehameha&#x27;s father. The author also says that Kameʻeiamoku told Kamehameha I that he was the son of Kahekili II, saying, &quot;I have something to tell you: Ka-hekili was your father, you were not Keoua&#x27;s son. Here are the tokens that you are the son of Ka-hekili.&quot;

King Kalākaua wrote that these rumors were scandals and should be dismissed as the offspring of hatred and jealousies of later years. Regardless of the rumors, Kamehameha was a descendant of Keawe through his mother Kekuʻiapoiwa II; Keōua acknowledged him as his son and he is recognized as such by all the sovereigns and most genealogists.

Accounts of Kamehameha I&#x27;s birth vary, but sources place his birth between 1736 and 1761, with historian Ralph Simpson Kuykendall believing it to be between 1748 and 1761. An early source is thought to imply a 1758 dating because that date matched a visit from Halley&#x27;s Comet, and would make him close to the age that Francisco de Paula Marín estimated he was. This dating, however, does not accord with the details of many well-known accounts of his life, such as his fighting as a warrior with his uncle, Kalaniʻōpuʻu, or his being of age to father his first children by that time. The 1758 dating also places his birth after the death of his father.

Kamakau published an account in the &quot;Ka Nupepa Kuokoa&quot; in 1867 placing the date of Kamehameha&#x27;s birth around 1736. He wrote, &quot;It was during the time of the warfare among the chiefs of [the island of] Hawaii which followed the death of Keawe, chief over the whole island (Ke-awe-i-kekahi-aliʻi-o-ka-moku) that Kamehameha I was born&quot;. However, his general dating has been challenged as twenty years too early, related to disputes over Kamakau&#x27;s inaccuracy of dating compared to accounts of foreign visitors. Regardless, Abraham Fornander wrote in his book, &quot;An Account of the Polynesian Race: Its Origins and Migrations&quot;: &quot;when Kamehameha died in 1819 he was past eighty years old. His birth would thus fall between 1736 and 1740, probably nearer the former than the latter&quot;. &quot;A Brief History of the Hawaiian People&quot; by William De Witt Alexander lists the birth date in the &quot;Chronological Table of Events of Hawaiian History&quot; as 1736. In 1888 the Kamakau account was challenged by Samuel C. Damon in the missionary publication; &quot;The Friend&quot;, deferring to a 1753 dating that was the first mentioned by James Jackson Jarves. But the Kamakau dating was widely accepted due to support from Abraham Fornander.

===Concealment and childhood===
At the time of Kamehameha&#x27;s birth, his father, Keōua, along with his half-brother, Kalaniʻōpuʻu, were serving Alapaʻinui, ruler of the island of Hawai’i; Alapaʻinui had brought the brothers to his court, after defeating both of their fathers in the civil war that followed the death of Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku. Keōua had died while Kamehameha was very young, thus the boy was raised in the court of his uncle, Kalaniʻōpuʻu. The traditional &quot;mele&quot; chant of Keakamahana (chiefess and wife of Alapainui) mentions that Kamehameha was born in the month of &quot;ikuwā&quot; (autumn/winter), or around November; Alapai gave the young Kamehameha to Keaka and her sister, Hākau, to raise, once the ruler discovered the infant had indeed survived.

On February 10, 1911, the Kamakau version was challenged by the oral history of the Kaha family, as published in newspaper articles also appearing in the &quot;Kuoko&quot;. After Kamakau&#x27;s history was published again (this time to a wider, English-reading public in 1911 Hawaii), the Kaha version of these events was published by Kamaka Stillman, who had objected to the Nupepa article.

== Conquest of the islands ==

===Hawaii Island===
Kamehameha was raised in the royal court of his uncle Kalaniʻōpuʻu. He achieved prominence in 1782, upon Kalaniʻōpuʻu&#x27;s death. While the kingship was inherited by Kīwalaʻō, Kalaniʻōpuʻu&#x27;s son, Kamehameha was given a prominent religious position as guardian of the Hawaiian god of war, Kūkaʻilimoku. He was also given control of the district of Waipiʻo Valley. The two cousins&#x27; relationship was strained after Kamehameha made a dedication to the gods instead of allowing Kīwalaʻō to do that. Kamehameha accepted the allegiance of a group of chiefs from the Kona district.

The other story took place after the prophecy was passed along by the high priests and high chiefs. When Kamehameha was able to lift the Naha Stone, he was considered the fulfiller of the prophecy. Other ruling chiefs, Keawe Mauhili, the Mahoe (twins) Keoua, and other chiefs rejected the prophecy of Ka Poukahi. The high chiefs of Kauai supported Kiwalaʻo even after learning about the prophecy.

The five Kona chiefs supporting Kamehameha were Keʻeaumoku Pāpaʻiahiahi (Kamehameha&#x27;s father-in-law/grand uncle), Keaweaheulu Kaluaʻāpana (Kamehameha&#x27;s uncle), Kekūhaupiʻo (Kamehameha&#x27;s warrior teacher), and Kameʻeiamoku and Kamanawa (twin uncles of Kamehameha). They defended Kamehameha as the unifier Ka Naʻi aupuni. High Chiefs Keawe Mauhili and Keeaumoku were by genealogy the next in line for aliʻi nui. Both chose the younger nephews Kīwalaʻō and Kamehameha over themselves. Kīwalaʻō was soon defeated in the first key conflict, the Battle of Mokuʻōhai. Kamehameha and his chiefs took over Konohiki responsibilities and sacred obligations of the districts of Kohala, Kona, and Hāmākua on Hawaiʻi island.

The prophecy included far more than Hawaiʻi island. It went across and beyond the Pacific Islands to the semi-continent of Aotearoa (New Zealand). He was supported by his most political wife Kaʻahumanu and father, High Chief Keeaumoku. Senior counselor to Kamehameha, she became one of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s most powerful figures. Kamehameha and his council of chiefs planned to unite the rest of the Hawaiian Islands. Allies came from British and American traders, who sold guns and ammunition to Kamehameha. Another major factor in Kamehameha&#x27;s continued success was the support of Kauai chief Kaʻiana and Captain William Brown of the Butterworth Squadron. He guaranteed Kamehameha unlimited gunpowder from China and gave him the formula for gunpowder: sulfur, saltpeter, and charcoal, all of which are abundant in the islands. Two westerners who lived on Hawaiʻi island, Isaac Davis and John Young, married native Hawaiian women and assisted Kamehameha.

===Olowalu Massacre===
In 1789, Simon Metcalfe had been captaining a fur-trading vessel, the &quot;Eleanora&quot;, while his son, Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe, captained the ship along the Pacific Northwest Coast; the two parties were to rendezvous in the Hawaiian Islands. &quot;Fair American&quot; was held-up when it was captured by the Spanish and then quickly released in San Blas, north of Panamá.

The &quot;Eleanora&quot; finally arrived in 1790, where it was greeted by chief Kameʻeiamoku. During their interactions, the chief is allegedly to have offended or insulted Captain Metcalfe somehow, causing him to strike the chief with a rope&#x27;s end. Sometime later, while docked in Honolua, Maui, a small boat—which was tied to the larger ship, and had a crewman inside—was stolen by native islanders. When Metcalfe discovered where the boat was taken, he sailed directly to the village of Olowalu. There, he confirmed that the boat had been broken-apart and the shipmate murdered. Previously, Metcalfe had resorted to violence when he fired muskets into another village near where he had been anchored, ultimately killing some of the residents. This time, furious, Metcalfe took-aim at Olowalu, ordering all cannons aboard the ship to be moved to one side, facing the island. As the captain initiated his trading calls and greetings to the locals, hundreds of people—men, women, children and elderly—ventured down to the beach to trade, on foot and by canoe. When the islanders were within range, Metcalfe ordered the cannons to be fired on the Hawaiians, killing over 100 of them.

Six weeks later, &quot;Fair American&quot; was stuck near the Kona coast of Hawaii where chief Kameʻeiamoku was living, near Kaʻūpūlehu. Kameʻeiamoku had decided to attack the next foreign ship to avenge the strike by the elder Metcalfe. He canoed out to the ship with his men, where he killed Metcalfe&#x27;s son and all but one (Isaac Davis) of the five crewmen. Kamehameha took Davis into protection and took possession of the ship. &quot;Eleanora&quot; was at that time anchored at Kealakekua Bay, where the ship&#x27;s boatswain had gone ashore and been captured by Kamehameha&#x27;s forces because Kamehameha believed Metcalfe was planning more revenge. &quot;Eleanora&quot; waited several days before sailing off, apparently without knowledge of what had happened to &quot;Fair American&quot; or Metcalfe&#x27;s son. Davis and &quot;Eleanora&#x27;s&quot; boatswain, John Young, tried to escape, but were treated as chiefs, given wives and settled in Hawaii.

===Invasion of Maui===
In 1790, while the aliʻi Kahekili II was on Oʻahu, Kamehameha&#x27;s army invaded Maui with the assistance of John Young and Isaac Davis. Using cannons from the &quot;Fair American&quot;, they defeated Maui&#x27;s army led by Kahekili&#x27;s son Kalanikūpule at the bloody Battle of Kepaniwai .

In 1791, Kahekili, supported by his brother Kāʻeokūlani, aliʻi of Kauaʻi, reconquered Maui and also acquired cannons. In April or May 1791, Kahekili tried to invade the island of Hawaiʻi, but was defeated in a naval battle called Kepuwahaʻulaʻula near Waipiʻo.

===Death of Keōua Kuahuula===
In 1790, Keōua Kūʻahuʻula, who came to rule the districts of Kaʻū and Puna, took advantage of Kamehameha&#x27;s absence in Maui and began raiding the west coast of Hawaii. He also advanced against the district of Hilo, deposing his uncle Keawemaʻuhili. When Kamehameha returned, Keōua escaped to the Kīlauea volcano, which erupted. Many warriors died from the poisonous gas emitted from the volcano.

When the Puʻukoholā Heiau was completed in 1791, Kamehameha invited Keōua to meet with him. Keōua may have been dispirited by his recent losses. He may have mutilated himself before landing so as to render himself an inappropriate sacrificial victim. As he stepped on shore, one of Kamehameha&#x27;s chiefs threw a spear at him. By some accounts, he dodged it but was then cut down by musket fire. Caught by surprise, Keōua&#x27;s bodyguards were killed. With Keōua dead, and his supporters captured or slain, Kamehameha became King of Hawaiʻi island.

===Maui and Oʻahu===
In 1794, the aged Kahekili II died. He left the governance of Oʻahu to his son Kalanikūpule and of Maui and Molokaʻi to Kāʻeokūlani. A civil war between the two broke out, which ended when Kalanikūpule killed Kāʻeokūlani, taking control of Maui and Molokaʻi. This initiated a succession crisis on Kauaʻi, which had previously been ruled by Kāʻeokūlani.

Seeing an opportunity, in 1795, Kamehameha set sail with an armada of 960 war canoes and 10,000 soldiers. He quickly secured the lightly defended islands of Maui and Molokaʻi at the Battle of Kawela. He moved on to the island of Oʻahu, landing his troops at Waiʻalae and Waikīkī. Kamehameha did not know that one of his commanders, a high-ranking &quot;aliʻi&quot; named Kaʻiana, had defected to Kalanikūpule. Kaʻiana assisted in cutting notches into the Nuʻuanu Pali mountain ridge; these notches, like those on a castle turret, were to serve as gunports for Kalanikūpule&#x27;s cannon. In a series of skirmishes, Kamehameha&#x27;s forces pushed Kalanikūpule&#x27;s men back until they were cornered on the Pali Lookout. While Kamehameha moved on the Pali, his troops took heavy fire from the cannon. He assigned two divisions of his best warriors to climb to the Pali to attack the cannons from behind; they surprised Kalanikūpule&#x27;s gunners and took control. With the loss of their guns, Kalanikūpule&#x27;s troops fell into disarray and were cornered by Kamehameha&#x27;s still-organized troops. A fierce battle at Nuʻuanu ensued, with Kamehameha&#x27;s forces forming an enclosing wall. Using traditional Hawaiian spears, as well as muskets and cannon, they killed most of Kalanikūpule&#x27;s forces. Over 400 men were forced over the Pali&#x27;s cliff, a drop of 1,000 feet. Kaʻiana was killed during the action; Kalanikūpule was later captured and sacrificed to Kūkāʻilimoku.

===Kauaʻi and rebellion of Nāmakehā===
After his conquest of Oahu in the summer of 1795, Kamehameha I prepared his forces for the conquest of Kauaʻi, the last remaining island kingdom out of his control. In the spring of 1796, he attempted to continue with his forces to Kauaʻi but he lost many of his canoes in the strong winds and rough seas of the Kaʻieʻie Waho channel. He returned to Hawaii to pacify the rebellion of Nāmakehā (brother of Kaʻiana) in Hilo and ruled from Hawaii for the next six years as he consolidated his conquests and prepare for a second invasion of Kauaʻi. At Hilo, Kamehameha I commissioned the building a large fleet of 800 (according to Kamakau) double-hulled war canoes called &quot;peleleu&quot; along with Western schooners, and he also stockpile large number of guns, canons and ammunition. He took his &quot;peleleu&quot; to Maui where he stayed from 1802 to 1803 and then to Oʻahu in late 1803 or early 1804. While in Oʻahu, a large percentage of his force was killed by the &quot;maʻi ʻokuʻu&quot; epidemic, which was thought to be either cholera or bubonic plague. Kamehameha I contracted the illness but survived. The second invasion of Kauaʻi was postponed.

By now, the succession crisis on Kauaʻi had resolved, with Kāʻeokūlani&#x27;s son, Kaumualiʻi, emerging as the new king. In April 1810, Kamehameha I negotiated the peaceful unification of the islands with Kaumualiʻi. His court genealogist and high priest Kalaikuʻahulu was instrumental in the monarch&#x27;s decision to leave Kaumualiʻi as a tributary king rather than killing him, when he was the single member of the aliʻi council to agree with Kamehameha&#x27;s own reluctance to do so. The other aliʻi continued with the plan to poison Kaumualiʻi when Isaac Davis warned him, making the ruler cut his trip short and return to Kauaʻi, leaving Davis to be poisoned by the aliʻi instead.

==Aliʻi Mo&#x27;i of the Hawaiian Islands==
As ruler, Kamehameha took steps to ensure the islands remained a united realm after his death. He unified the legal system. He used the products collected in taxes to promote trade with Europe and the United States.

The origins of the &quot;Law of the Splintered Paddle&quot; are derived from before the unification of the Island of Hawaiʻi. In 1782 during a raid, Kamehameha caught his foot in a rock. Two local fishermen, fearful of the great warrior, hit Kamehameha hard on the head with a large paddle, which broke the paddle. Kamehameha was stunned and left for dead, allowing the fisherman and his companion to escape. Twelve years later, the same fishermen were brought before Kamehameha for punishment. The king instead blamed himself for attacking innocent people, gave the fishermen gifts of land and set them free. He declared the new law, &quot;Let every elderly person, woman, and child lie by the roadside in safety.&quot;

Young and Davis became advisors to Kamehameha and provided him with advanced weapons that helped in combat. Kamehameha was also a religious king and the holder of the war god Kūkāʻilimoku. The explorer George Vancouver noted that Kamehameha worshiped his gods and wooden images in a heiau, but originally wanted to bring England&#x27;s religion, Christianity, to Hawaiʻi. Missionaries were not sent from Great Britain because Kamehameha told Vancouver that the gods he worshiped were his gods with &quot;mana&quot;, and that through these gods, Kamehameha had become supreme ruler over all of the islands. Witnessing Kamehameha&#x27;s devotion, Vancouver decided against sending missionaries from England.

==Later life==
After about 1812, Kamehameha returned from Oahu and spent the last years of his life at Kamakahonu, a compound he built in Kailua-Kona. As was the custom of the time, he had several wives and many children, though he outlived many of them.

===Final resting place===
When Kamehameha died on May 8 or 14, 1819, his body was hidden by his trusted friends, Hoapili and Hoʻolulu, in the ancient custom called &quot;hūnākele&quot; (literally, &quot;to hide in secret&quot;). The &quot;mana&quot;, or power of a person, was considered to be sacred. As per the ancient custom, his body was buried in a hidden location because of his &quot;mana&quot;. His final resting place remains unknown. At one point in his reign, Kamehameha III asked that Hoapili show him where his father&#x27;s bones were buried, but on the way there Hoapili knew that they were being followed, so he turned around.

==Family==
Kamehameha had many wives. The exact number is debated because documents that recorded the names of his wives were destroyed. Hiram Bingham I lists 21 wives, but earlier research from Mary Kawena Pukui counted 26. In &quot;Kamehameha&#x27;s Children Today&quot; authors Charles Ahlo, Rubellite Kawena Johnson and Jerry Walker list 30 wives: 18 who had children, and 12 who did not. They state the total number of children to be 35: 17 sons and 18 daughters. While he had many wives and children, only his children through his highest-ranking wife, Keōpūolani, succeeded him to the throne. In &quot;Hoʻomana: Understanding the Sacred and Spiritual&quot;, Chun stated that Keōpūolani supported Kaʻahumanu&#x27;s ending of the Kapu system as the best way to ensure that Kamehameha&#x27;s children and grandchildren would rule the kingdom.


== Legacy ==

* The Hawaiian public holiday King Kamehameha I Day is named after and honors King Kamehameha I. It was first proclaimed in 1871 by his grandson, King Kamehameha V.

===In popular culture===
* &quot;Kamehameha&quot; is the namesake of Goku&#x27;s signature technique and energy attack in the Japanese media franchise &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. Series creator Akira Toriyama stated he named the attack after Kamehameha thanks to his wife&#x27;s advice.

<doc id="67157" wikidata="Q836538" url="?curid=67157" title="Tzatziki">
<text>Tzatziki (, , ), also known as cacık () or tarator, is a class of dip, soup, or sauce found in the cuisines of Southeastern Europe and West Asia. It is made of salted strained yogurt or diluted yogurt mixed with cucumbers, garlic, salt, olive oil, red wine vinegar, sometimes with lemon juice, and herbs such as dill, mint, parsley and thyme. It is served as a cold appetiser (meze), a side dish, and as a sauce for souvlaki and gyros sandwiches and other foods.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;tzatziki&quot; appeared in English around the mid-20th century as a loanword from Modern Greek (), which in turn comes from the Turkish word . The root is likely related to several words in West Asian languages. Persian &quot;&quot; () refers to various herbs used for cooking, and Kurdish jaj or ژاژ refers to the caraway herb. That word is combined with the Turkish diminutive suffix &quot;-cık&quot; to yield &quot;cacık&quot;. It may be related to an Armenian word, &quot;cacıg&quot;. According to Sevan Nişanyan the Armenian word may itself come from Turkish or Kurdish.

Evliya Çelebi&#x27;s 1665 travelogue, the &quot;Seyahatnâme&quot;, defined &quot;cacıχ&quot; (&quot;cacıg&quot;) as a kind of herb that is added to food. The modern term &quot;cacık&quot; (جاجیك) was mentioned in print for the first time in 1844 in Kâmil Pasha&#x27;s &quot;Melceü&#x27;t-Tabbâhîn&quot; (&quot;The Sanctuary of Cooks&quot;), the first Ottoman cookbook, in which the basic description is given as &quot;yogurt with cucumber and garlic&quot; (&quot;hıyar ve sarmısaklı yoğurt&quot;).

The form &quot;&quot;, found in languages from the Balkans to the Levant, may be of Persian origin, with derivative forms now found in a range of countries.

==History==
&quot;Tarator&quot; was the name of a dish made of ground walnuts and vinegar in the Ottoman Empire. Dishes of various preparations in the region, including dips, salads, and sauces, acquired the name. In the Levant, &quot;tarator&quot; is a sauce based on tahini, while in Turkey and the Balkans it came to mean a combination of yogurt and cucumbers, sometimes with walnuts. It has become a traditional part of meze.

==Variations==

===Greece===

Greek-style tzatziki sauce is commonly served as a meze, to be eaten with bread, fried eggplant, or zucchini.

Tzatziki is made of strained yogurt (usually from sheep or goat milk) mixed with cucumbers, garlic, salt, olive oil, red wine vinegar, and dill or mint or parsley.

A variation made with purslane ( in Greek) may be called , meaning &#x27;purslane and yogurt salad&#x27;, rather than tzatziki. One simple recipe calls for purslane, olive oil, red wine vinegar and dill. Another is made with purslane, mint, cilantro, parsley and ground coriander, along with the standard yogurt-cucumber base.

===Turkey===

Turkish &quot;cacık&quot; is made by combining water and yogurt together with garlic and different combinations of vegetables and herbs. Labne may be substituted for some of the yogurt.

Turkish cacik also has many variations, different recipes use wheat berries, carrots, scallions, mint, radish, red pepper, parsley, dill, basil, chondrilla juncea, vinegar, walnuts, hazelnuts and unripe almonds.

For &quot;cacıklı arap köftesi&quot;, kofta made from a mix of bulgur and ground meat is served over &quot;cacık&quot;. In this case the &quot;cacık&quot; is made with chard rather than the usual cucumber (spinach or parsley may be substituted for the chard. Some recipes use purslane). &quot;Bulgurlu madımak cacığı&quot; is made with cracked wheat, cucumber and a type of knotweed called &quot;madımak&quot;.

===Balkans===
&quot;Tarator&quot; is found in many Balkan countries. It is often prepared as a cold soup, popular in the summer. It is made of yogurt, cucumber, garlic, walnut, dill, vegetable oil, and water, and is served chilled or even with ice. Local variations may replace yogurt with water and vinegar, omit nuts or dill, or add bread. The cucumbers may on rare occasions be replaced with lettuce or carrots.

A thicker variation is sometimes known as &quot;dry &quot;tarator&quot;&quot;, or as &quot;Snezhanka&quot; salad, which means &#x27;Snow White salad&#x27;, and is served as an appetiser or side dish. During preparation, the yogurt is hung for several hours in a kerchief and loses about half of its water. The cucumbers, garlic, minced walnuts, salt and vegetable oil are then added.

In Bulgaria, &quot;tarator&quot; is a popular meze (appetiser), but is also served as a side dish along with Shopska salad with some meals. Sunflower oil and olive oil are more commonly used, and the walnuts are sometimes omitted. &quot;Tarator&quot; is seasoned with garlic and dill, both of which can be omitted. It&#x27;s a popular dish in Bulgaria and a common refresher during the summer.

In Albania, &quot;tarator&quot; is a very popular dish in the summertime. It is usually served cold and is normally made from yogurt, garlic, parsley, cucumber, salt and olive oil. Fried squid is often offered with &quot;tarator&quot;. Other similar Albanian variants are &quot;Salcë Kosi&quot; and &quot;Xaxiq&quot;. 

In North Macedonia, &quot;tarator&quot; is popular summer cold dish or meze made from yogurt or &quot;kiselo mleko&quot;, cucumbers, garlic and sometimes dill.

===Cyprus===
In Cyprus, the dish is known as (&quot;talattouri&quot;) and is similar to the Greek recipe with a more characteristic flavour of mint and added acidity in the form of lemon juice.

It is made from strained yogurt, sliced cucumbers, minced garlic cloves, lemon juice and sprinkled with dried mint, oregano or olive oil.

===Middle East===
In Iraq, &quot;jajeek&quot; is often served as meze. It may accompany alcoholic drinks, especially arak, an ouzo-like drink made from anise. In Iran it is known as &quot;mast o khiar&quot;.

in Saudi Arabia, it is known as , &quot;salaṭat ḵiyār bi-l-laban&quot;, made from yogurt and cucumbers.

===Similar dishes===

A variation in the Caucasus mountains, called &quot;ovdukh&quot;, uses kefir instead of the yogurt. This can be poured over a mixture of vegetables, eggs and ham to create a variation of &quot;okroshka&quot;, sometimes referred to as a &quot;Caucasus &quot;okroshka&quot;&quot;. &quot;Mizeria&quot; is another variation from Poland, using the same ingredients but substituting sour cream for yogurt.

In South Asia, a similar dish is made with yogurt, cucumber, salt and ground cumin (sometimes also including onions) called &quot;raita&quot;.

In Iran, ash-e doogh is another type of yogurt soup; instead of cucumbers it contains a variety of herbs such as basil, leek, mint, black pepper and raisins. In this style, sometimes dried bread chips, chopped nuts or raisins are put in the dish just before serving.

<text>Red blood cells (RBCs), referred to as erythrocytes (, with -&quot;cyte&quot; translated as &#x27;cell&#x27; in modern usage) in academia and medical publishing, also known as red cells, erythroid cells, and rarely haematids, are the most common type of blood cell and the vertebrate&#x27;s principal means of delivering oxygen () to the body tissues—via blood flow through the circulatory system. Erythrocytes take up oxygen in the lungs, or in fish the gills, and release it into tissues while squeezing through the body&#x27;s capillaries.

The cytoplasm of a red blood cell is rich in hemoglobin (Hb), an iron-containing biomolecule that can bind oxygen and is responsible for the red color of the cells and the blood. Each human red blood cell contains approximately 270 million hemoglobin molecules. The cell membrane is composed of proteins and lipids, and this structure provides properties essential for physiological cell function such as deformability and stability of the blood cell while traversing the circulatory system and specifically the capillary network.

In humans, mature red blood cells are flexible biconcave disks. They lack a cell nucleus (which is expelled during development) and organelles, to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin; they can be viewed as sacks of hemoglobin, with a plasma membrane as the sack. Approximately 2.4 million new erythrocytes are produced per second in human adults. The cells develop in the bone marrow and circulate for about 100–120 days in the body before their components are recycled by macrophages. Each circulation takes about 60 seconds (one minute). Approximately 84% of the cells in the human body are the 20–30 trillion red blood cells. Nearly half of the blood&#x27;s volume (40% to 45%) is red blood cells.

Packed red blood cells are red blood cells that have been donated, processed, and stored in a blood bank for blood transfusion.

== Structure ==

===Vertebrates===
 The vast majority of vertebrates, including mammals and humans, have red blood cells. These erythrocytes are cells present in blood to transport oxygen. The only known vertebrates without red blood cells are the crocodile icefish (family Channichthyidae); they live in very oxygen-rich cold water and transport oxygen freely dissolved in their blood. While they no longer use hemoglobin, remnants of hemoglobin genes can be found in their genome.

Vertebrate red blood cells consist mainly of hemoglobin, a complex metalloprotein containing heme groups whose iron atoms temporarily bind to oxygen molecules (O2) in the lungs or gills and release them throughout the body. Oxygen can easily diffuse through the erythrocyte&#x27;s cell membrane. Hemoglobin in the red blood cells also carries some of the waste product carbon dioxide back from the tissues; most waste carbon dioxide, however, is transported back to the pulmonary capillaries of the lungs as bicarbonate (HCO3−) dissolved in the blood plasma. Myoglobin, a compound related to hemoglobin, acts to store oxygen in muscle cells.

The color of red blood cells is due to the heme group of hemoglobin. The blood plasma alone is straw-colored, but the red blood cells change color depending on the state of the hemoglobin: when combined with oxygen the resulting oxyhemoglobin is scarlet, and when oxygen has been released the resulting deoxyhemoglobin is of a dark red burgundy color. However, blood can appear bluish when seen through the vessel wall and skin. Pulse oximetry takes advantage of the hemoglobin color change to directly measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation using colorimetric techniques. Hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for carbon monoxide, forming carboxyhemoglobin which is a very bright red in color. Flushed, confused patients with a saturation reading of 100% on pulse oximetry are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.

Having oxygen-carrying proteins inside specialized cells (as opposed to oxygen carriers being dissolved in body fluid) was an important step in the evolution of vertebrates as it allows for less viscous blood, higher concentrations of oxygen, and better diffusion of oxygen from the blood to the tissues. The size of red blood cells varies widely among vertebrate species; red blood cell width is on average about 25% larger than capillary diameter, and it has been hypothesized that this improves the oxygen transfer from red blood cells to tissues.

===Mammals===
The red blood cells of mammals are typically shaped as biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped cross section, and a torus-shaped rim on the edge of the disk. This shape allows for a high surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio to facilitate diffusion of gases. However, there are some exceptions concerning shape in the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates including cattle, deer, and their relatives), which displays a wide variety of bizarre red blood cell morphologies: small and highly ovaloid cells in llamas and camels (family Camelidae), tiny spherical cells in mouse deer (family Tragulidae), and cells which assume fusiform, lanceolate, crescentic, and irregularly polygonal and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti (family Cervidae). Members of this order have clearly evolved a mode of red blood cell development substantially different from the mammalian norm. Overall, mammalian red blood cells are remarkably flexible and deformable so as to squeeze through tiny capillaries, as well as to maximize their apposing surface by assuming a cigar shape, where they efficiently release their oxygen load.

Red blood cells in mammals are unique amongst vertebrates as they do not have nuclei when mature. They do have nuclei during early phases of erythropoiesis, but extrude them during development as they mature; this provides more space for hemoglobin. The red blood cells without nuclei, called reticulocytes, subsequently lose all other cellular organelles such as their mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum.

The spleen acts as a reservoir of red blood cells, but this effect is somewhat limited in humans. In some other mammals such as dogs and horses, the spleen sequesters large numbers of red blood cells, which are dumped into the blood during times of exertion stress, yielding a higher oxygen transport capacity.

===Human===

A typical human red blood cell has a disk diameter of approximately 6.2–8.2 μm and a maximum thickness of 2–2.5 μm and a minimum thickness in the centre of 0.8–1 μm, being much smaller than most other human cells. These cells have an average volume of about 90 fL with a surface area of about 136 μm2, and can swell up to a sphere shape containing 150 fL, without membrane distension.

Adult humans have roughly 20–30 trillion red blood cells at any given time, constituting approximately 70% of all cells by number. Women have about 4–5 million red blood cells per microliter (cubic millimeter) of blood and men about 5–6 million; people living at high altitudes with low oxygen tension will have more. Red blood cells are thus much more common than the other blood particles: there are about 4,000–11,000 white blood cells and about 150,000–400,000 platelets per microliter.

Human red blood cells take on average 60 seconds to complete one cycle of circulation.

The blood&#x27;s red color is due to the spectral properties of the hemic iron ions in hemoglobin. Each hemoglobin molecule carries four heme groups; hemoglobin constitutes about a third of the total cell volume. Hemoglobin is responsible for the transport of more than 98% of the oxygen in the body (the remaining oxygen is carried dissolved in the blood plasma). The red blood cells of an average adult human male store collectively about 2.5 grams of iron, representing about 65% of the total iron contained in the body.

==Microstructure==
===Nucleus===
Red blood cells in mammals are &quot;anucleate&quot; when mature, meaning that they lack a cell nucleus. In comparison, the red blood cells of other vertebrates have nuclei; the only known exceptions are salamanders of the family &quot;Plethodontidae&quot;, where five different clades has evolved various degrees of enucleated red blood cells (most evolved in some species of the genus &quot;Batrachoseps&quot;), and fish of the genus &quot;Maurolicus&quot;.

The elimination of the nucleus in vertebrate red blood cells has been offered as an explanation for the subsequent accumulation of non-coding DNA in the genome. The argument runs as follows: Efficient gas transport requires red blood cells to pass through very narrow capillaries, and this constrains their size. In the absence of nuclear elimination, the accumulation of repeat sequences is constrained by the volume occupied by the nucleus, which increases with genome size.

Nucleated red blood cells in mammals consist of two forms: normoblasts, which are normal erythropoietic precursors to mature red blood cells, and megaloblasts, which are abnormally large precursors that occur in megaloblastic anemias.

===Membrane composition===
Red blood cells are deformable, flexible, are able to adhere to other cells, and are able to interface with immune cells. Their membrane plays many roles in this. These functions are highly dependent on the membrane composition. The red blood cell membrane is composed of 3 layers: the glycocalyx on the exterior, which is rich in carbohydrates; the lipid bilayer which contains many transmembrane proteins, besides its lipidic main constituents; and the membrane skeleton, a structural network of proteins located on the inner surface of the lipid bilayer. Half of the membrane mass in human and most mammalian red blood cells are proteins. The other half are lipids, namely phospholipids and cholesterol.

====Membrane lipids====

The red blood cell membrane comprises a typical lipid bilayer, similar to what can be found in virtually all human cells. Simply put, this lipid bilayer is composed of cholesterol and phospholipids in equal proportions by weight. The lipid composition is important as it defines many physical properties such as membrane permeability and fluidity. Additionally, the activity of many membrane proteins is regulated by interactions with lipids in the bilayer.

Unlike cholesterol, which is evenly distributed between the inner and outer leaflets, the 5 major phospholipids are asymmetrically disposed, as shown below:

Outer monolayer
* Phosphatidylcholine (PC);
* Sphingomyelin (SM).

Inner monolayer
* Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE);
* Phosphoinositol (PI) (small amounts).
* Phosphatidylserine (PS);

This asymmetric phospholipid distribution among the bilayer is the result of the function of several energy-dependent and energy-independent phospholipid transport proteins. Proteins called &quot;Flippases&quot; move phospholipids from the outer to the inner monolayer, while others called &quot;floppases&quot; do the opposite operation, against a concentration gradient in an energy-dependent manner. Additionally, there are also &quot;scramblase&quot; proteins that move phospholipids in both directions at the same time, down their concentration gradients in an energy-independent manner. There is still considerable debate ongoing regarding the identity of these membrane maintenance proteins in the red cell membrane.

The maintenance of an asymmetric phospholipid distribution in the bilayer (such as an exclusive localization of PS and PIs in the inner monolayer) is critical for the cell integrity and function due to several reasons:
* Macrophages recognize and phagocytose red cells that expose PS at their outer surface. Thus the confinement of PS in the inner monolayer is essential if the cell is to survive its frequent encounters with macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, especially in the spleen.
* Premature destruction of thallassemic and sickle red cells has been linked to disruptions of lipid asymmetry leading to exposure of PS on the outer monolayer.
* An exposure of PS can potentiate adhesion of red cells to vascular endothelial cells, effectively preventing normal transit through the microvasculature. Thus it is important that PS is maintained only in the inner leaflet of the bilayer to ensure normal blood flow in microcirculation.
* Both PS and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) can regulate membrane mechanical function, due to their interactions with skeletal proteins such as spectrin and protein 4.1R. Recent studies have shown that binding of spectrin to PS promotes membrane mechanical stability. PIP2 enhances the binding of protein band 4.1R to glycophorin C but decreases its interaction with protein band 3, and thereby may modulate the linkage of the bilayer to the membrane skeleton.

The presence of specialized structures named &quot;lipid rafts&quot; in the red blood cell membrane have been described by recent studies. These are structures enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids associated with specific membrane proteins, namely flotillins, STOMatins (band 7), G-proteins, and β-adrenergic receptors. Lipid rafts that have been implicated in cell signaling events in nonerythroid cells have been shown in erythroid cells to mediate β2-adregenic receptor signaling and increase cAMP levels, and thus regulating entry of malarial parasites into normal red cells.

====Membrane proteins====

The proteins of the membrane skeleton are responsible for the deformability, flexibility and durability of the red blood cell, enabling it to squeeze through capillaries less than half the diameter of the red blood cell (7–8 μm) and recovering the discoid shape as soon as these cells stop receiving compressive forces, in a similar fashion to an object made of rubber.

There are currently more than 50 known membrane proteins, which can exist in a few hundred up to a million copies per red blood cell. Approximately 25 of these membrane proteins carry the various blood group antigens, such as the A, B and Rh antigens, among many others. These membrane proteins can perform a wide diversity of functions, such as transporting ions and molecules across the red cell membrane, adhesion and interaction with other cells such as endothelial cells, as signaling receptors, as well as other currently unknown functions. The blood types of humans are due to variations in surface glycoproteins of red blood cells. Disorders of the proteins in these membranes are associated with many disorders, such as hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary stomatocytosis, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

The red blood cell membrane proteins organized according to their function:

Transport
* Band 3 – Anion transporter, also an important structural component of the red blood cell membrane, makes up to 25% of the cell membrane surface, each red cell contains approximately one million copies. Defines the Diego Blood Group;
* Aquaporin 1 – water transporter, defines the Colton Blood Group;
* Glut1 – glucose and L-dehydroascorbic acid transporter;
* MCT1 – Monocarboxylate transporter for exporting Lactic acid to the liver. See Cori cycle.;
* Kidd antigen protein – urea transporter;
* RHAG – gas transporter, probably of carbon dioxide, defines Rh Blood Group and the associated unusual blood group phenotype Rhnull;
* Na+/K+ – ATPase;
* Ca2+ – ATPase;
* Na+ K+ 2Cl− – cotransporter;
* Na+-Cl− – cotransporter;
* Na-H exchanger;
* K-Cl – cotransporter;
* Gardos Channel.

Cell adhesion
* ICAM-4 – interacts with integrins;
* BCAM – a glycoprotein that defines the Lutheran blood group and also known as Lu or laminin-binding protein.

Structural role – The following membrane proteins establish linkages with skeletal proteins and may play an important role in regulating cohesion between the lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, likely enabling the red cell to maintain its favorable membrane surface area by preventing the membrane from collapsing (vesiculating).
* Ankyrin-based macromolecular complex – proteins linking the bilayer to the membrane skeleton through the interaction of their cytoplasmic domains with Ankyrin.
** Band 3 – also assembles various glycolytic enzymes, the presumptive CO2 transporter, and carbonic anhydrase into a macromolecular complex termed a &quot;metabolon,&quot; which may play a key role in regulating red cell metabolism and ion and gas transport function.
** RHAG – also involved in transport, defines associated unusual blood group phenotype Rhmod.
* Protein 4.1R-based macromolecular complex – proteins interacting with Protein 4.1R.
** Protein 4.1R – weak expression of Gerbich antigens;
** Glycophorin C and D – glycoprotein, defines Gerbich Blood Group;
** XK – defines the Kell Blood Group and the Mcleod unusual phenotype (lack of Kx antigen and greatly reduced expression of Kell antigens);
** RhD/RhCE – defines Rh Blood Group and the associated unusual blood group phenotype Rhnull;
** Duffy protein – has been proposed to be associated with chemokine clearance;
** Adducin – interaction with band 3;
** Dematin- interaction with the Glut1 glucose transporter.
===Surface electrostatic potential===
The zeta potential is an electrochemical property of cell surfaces that is determined by the net electrical charge of molecules exposed at the surface of cell membranes of the cell. The normal zeta potential of the red blood cell is −15.7 millivolts (mV). Much of this potential appears to be contributed by the exposed sialic acid residues in the membrane: their removal results in zeta potential of −6.06 mV.

===Role in transport===

Recall that respiration, as illustrated schematically here with a unit of carbohydrate, produces about as many molecules of carbon dioxide, CO2, as it consumes of oxygen, O2.

:&lt;chem&gt;HCOH + O2 -&gt; CO2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Thus, the function of the circulatory system is as much about the transport of carbon dioxide as about the transport of oxygen.
As stated elsewhere in this article, most of the carbon dioxide in the blood is in the form of bicarbonate ion. The bicarbonate provides a critical pH buffer. Thus, unlike hemoglobin for O2 transport, there is a physiological advantage to not having a specific CO2 transporter molecule.

Red blood cells, nevertheless, play a key role in the CO2 transport process, for two reasons.
First, because, besides hemoglobin, they contain a large number of copies of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase on the inside of their cell membrane. Carbonic anhydrase, as its name suggests, acts as a catalyst of the exchange between carbonic acid and carbon dioxide (which is the anhydride of carbonic acid). Because it is a catalyst, it can affect many CO2 molecules, so it performs its essential role without needing as many copies as are needed for O2 transport by hemoglobin.
In the presence of this catalyst carbon dioxide and carbonic acid reach an equilibrium very rapidly, while the red cells are still moving through the capillary. Thus it is the RBC that ensures that most of the CO2 is transported as bicarbonate.
At physiological pH the equilibrium strongly favors carbonic acid, which is mostly dissociated into bicarbonate ion.

:&lt;chem&gt;CO2 + H2O &lt;=» H2CO3 &lt;=» HCO3- + H+ &lt;/chem&gt;

The H+ ions released by this rapid reaction within RBC, while still in the capillary, act to reduce the oxygen binding affinity of hemoglobin, the Bohr effect.

The second major contribution of RBC to carbon dioxide transport is that carbon dioxide directly reacts with globin protein components of hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin compounds.
As oxygen is released in the tissues, more CO2 binds to hemoglobin, and as oxygen binds in the lung, it displaces the hemoglobin bound CO2, this is called the Haldane effect. Despite the fact that only a small amount of the CO2 in blood is bound to hemoglobin in venous blood, a greater proportion of the change in CO2 content between venous and arterial blood comes from the change in this bound CO2. That is, there is always an abundance of bicarbonate in blood, both venous and arterial, because of its aforementioned role as a pH buffer.

In summary, carbon dioxide produced by cellular respiration diffuses very rapidly to areas of lower concentration, specifically into nearby capillaries.
When it diffuses into a RBC, CO2 is rapidly converted by the carbonic anhydrase found on the inside of the RBC membrane into bicarbonate ion. The bicarbonate ions in turn leave the RBC in exchange for chloride ions from the plasma, facilitated by the band 3 anion transport protein colocated in the RBC membrane. The bicarbonate ion does not diffuse back out of the capillary, but is carried to the lung. In the lung the lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveoli causes carbon dioxide to diffuse rapidly from the capillary into the alveoli. The carbonic anhydrase in the red cells keeps the bicarbonate ion in equilibrium with carbon dioxide. So as carbon dioxide leaves the capillary, and CO2 is displaced by O2 on hemoglobin, sufficient bicarbonate ion converts rapidly to carbon dioxide to maintain the equilibrium.

===Secondary functions===
When red blood cells undergo shear stress in constricted vessels, they release ATP, which causes the vessel walls to relax and dilate so as to promote normal blood flow.

When their hemoglobin molecules are deoxygenated, red blood cells release S-Nitrosothiols, which also act to dilate blood vessels, thus directing more blood to areas of the body depleted of oxygen.

Red blood cells can also synthesize nitric oxide enzymatically, using L-arginine as substrate, as do endothelial cells. Exposure of red blood cells to physiological levels of shear stress activates nitric oxide synthase and export of nitric oxide, which may contribute to the regulation of vascular tonus.

Red blood cells can also produce hydrogen sulfide, a signalling gas that acts to relax vessel walls. It is believed that the cardioprotective effects of garlic are due to red blood cells converting its sulfur compounds into hydrogen sulfide.

Red blood cells also play a part in the body&#x27;s immune response: when lysed by pathogens such as bacteria, their hemoglobin releases free radicals, which break down the pathogen&#x27;s cell wall and membrane, killing it.

=== Cellular processes ===
As a result of not containing mitochondria, red blood cells use none of the oxygen they transport; instead they produce the energy carrier ATP by the glycolysis of glucose and lactic acid fermentation on the resulting pyruvate. Furthermore, the pentose phosphate pathway plays an important role in red blood cells; see glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency for more information.

As red blood cells contain no nucleus, protein biosynthesis is currently assumed to be absent in these cells.

Because of the lack of nuclei and organelles, mature red blood cells do not contain DNA and cannot synthesize any RNA (although it does contain RNAs), and consequently cannot divide and have limited repair capabilities. The inability to carry out protein synthesis means that no virus can evolve to target mammalian red blood cells. However, infection with parvoviruses (such as human parvovirus B19) can affect erythroid precursors while they still have DNA, as recognized by the presence of giant pronormoblasts with viral particles and inclusion bodies, thus temporarily depleting the blood of reticulocytes and causing anemia.

==Life cycle==
Human red blood cells are produced through a process named erythropoiesis, developing from committed stem cells to mature red blood cells in about 7 days. When matured, in a healthy individual these cells live in blood circulation for about 100 to 120 days (and 80 to 90 days in a full term infant). At the end of their lifespan, they are removed from circulation. In many chronic diseases, the lifespan of the red blood cells is reduced.

===Creation===

Erythropoiesis is the process by which new red blood cells are produced; it lasts about 7 days. Through this process red blood cells are continuously produced in the red bone marrow of large bones. (In the embryo, the liver is the main site of red blood cell production.) The production can be stimulated by the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), synthesised by the kidney. Just before and after leaving the bone marrow, the developing cells are known as reticulocytes; these constitute about 1% of circulating red blood cells.

===Functional lifetime===

The functional lifetime of a red blood cell is about 100–120 days, during which time the red blood cells are continually moved by the blood flow push (in arteries), pull (in veins) and a combination of the two as they squeeze through microvessels such as capillaries. They are also recycled in the bone marrow.

===Senescence===

The aging red blood cell undergoes changes in its plasma membrane, making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocyte system (spleen, liver and lymph nodes), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This process is termed eryptosis, red blood cell programmed death. This process normally occurs at the same rate of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating red blood cell count. Eryptosis is increased in a wide variety of diseases including sepsis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, malaria, sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, phosphate depletion, iron deficiency and Wilson&#x27;s disease. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, and energy depletion, as well as by a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics. Excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. Inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin, nitric oxide, catecholamines and high concentrations of urea.

Much of the resulting breakdown products are recirculated in the body. The heme constituent of hemoglobin are broken down into iron (Fe3+) and biliverdin. The biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin, which is released into the plasma and recirculated to the liver bound to albumin. The iron is released into the plasma to be recirculated by a carrier protein called transferrin. Almost all red blood cells are removed in this manner from the circulation before they are old enough to hemolyze. Hemolyzed hemoglobin is bound to a protein in plasma called haptoglobin, which is not excreted by the kidney.

==Clinical significance==

=== Disease ===
Blood diseases involving the red blood cells include:
* Anemias (or anaemias) are diseases characterized by low oxygen transport capacity of the blood, because of low red cell count or some abnormality of the red blood cells or the hemoglobin.

:* Iron deficiency anemia is the most common anemia; it occurs when the dietary intake or absorption of iron is insufficient, and hemoglobin, which contains iron, cannot be formed.

:* Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease wherein the body lacks intrinsic factor, required to absorb vitamin B12 from food. Vitamin B12 is needed for the production of red blood cells and hemoglobin.

:* Sickle-cell disease is a genetic disease that results in abnormal hemoglobin molecules. When these release their oxygen load in the tissues, they become insoluble, leading to mis-shaped red blood cells. These sickle shaped red cells are less deformable and viscoelastic, meaning that they have become rigid and can cause blood vessel blockage, pain, strokes, and other tissue damage.

:* Thalassemia is a genetic disease that results in the production of an abnormal ratio of hemoglobin subunits.

:*Hereditary spherocytosis syndromes are a group of inherited disorders characterized by defects in the red blood cell&#x27;s cell membrane, causing the cells to be small, sphere-shaped, and fragile instead of donut-shaped and flexible. These abnormal red blood cells are destroyed by the spleen. Several other hereditary disorders of the red blood cell membrane are known.

:* Aplastic anemia is caused by the inability of the bone marrow to produce blood cells.

:* Pure red cell aplasia is caused by the inability of the bone marrow to produce only red blood cells.

* Hemolysis is the general term for excessive breakdown of red blood cells. It can have several causes and can result in hemolytic anemia.

:* The malaria parasite spends part of its life-cycle in red blood cells, feeds on their hemoglobin and then breaks them apart, causing fever. Both sickle-cell disease and thalassemia are more common in malaria areas, because these mutations convey some protection against the parasite.
* Polycythemias (or erythrocytoses) are diseases characterized by a surplus of red blood cells. The increased viscosity of the blood can cause a number of symptoms.

:* In polycythemia vera the increased number of red blood cells results from an abnormality in the bone marrow.
* Several microangiopathic diseases, including disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathies, present with pathognomonic (diagnostic) red blood cell fragments called schistocytes. These pathologies generate fibrin strands that sever red blood cells as they try to move past a thrombus.

=== Transfusion ===

Red blood cells may be given as part of a blood transfusion. Blood may be donated from another person, or stored by the recipient at an earlier date. Donated blood usually requires screening to ensure that donors do not contain risk factors for the presence of blood-borne diseases, or will not suffer themselves by giving blood. Blood is usually collected and tested for common or serious blood-borne diseases including Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV. The blood type (A, B, AB, or O) or the blood product is identified and matched with the recipient&#x27;s blood to minimise the likelihood of acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, a type of transfusion reaction. This relates to the presence of antigens on the cell&#x27;s surface. After this process, the blood is stored, and within a short duration is used. Blood can be given as a whole product or the red blood cells separated as packed red blood cells.

Blood is often transfused when there is known anaemia, active bleeding, or when there is an expectation of serious blood loss, such as prior to an operation. Before blood is given, a small sample of the recipient&#x27;s blood is tested with the transfusion in a process known as cross-matching.

In 2008 it was reported that human embryonic stem cells had been successfully coaxed into becoming red blood cells in the lab. The difficult step was to induce the cells to eject their nucleus; this was achieved by growing the cells on stromal cells from the bone marrow. It is hoped that these artificial red blood cells can eventually be used for blood transfusions.

A human trial is conducted in 2022, using blood cultured from stem cells obtained from donor blood.

=== Tests ===

Several blood tests involve red blood cells. These include a &quot;RBC count&quot; (the number of red blood cells per volume of blood), calculation of the hematocrit (percentage of blood volume occupied by red blood cells), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The blood type needs to be determined to prepare for a blood transfusion or an organ transplantation.

Many diseases involving red blood cells are diagnosed with a blood film (or peripheral blood smear), where a thin layer of blood is smeared on a microscope slide. This may reveal poikilocytosis, which are variations in red blood cell shape. When red blood cells sometimes occur as a stack, flat side next to flat side. This is known as &quot;rouleaux formation&quot;, and it occurs more often if the levels of certain serum proteins are elevated, as for instance during inflammation.

=== Separation and blood doping ===
Red blood cells can be obtained from whole blood by centrifugation, which separates the cells from the blood plasma in a process known as blood fractionation. Packed red blood cells, which are made in this way from whole blood with the plasma removed, are used in transfusion medicine. During plasma donation, the red blood cells are pumped back into the body right away and only the plasma is collected.

Some athletes have tried to improve their performance by blood doping: first about 1 litre of their blood is extracted, then the red blood cells are isolated, frozen and stored, to be reinjected shortly before the competition. (Red blood cells can be conserved for 5 weeks at , or over 10 years using cryoprotectants) This practice is hard to detect but may endanger the human cardiovascular system which is not equipped to deal with blood of the resulting higher viscosity. Another method of blood doping involves injection with erythropoietin to stimulate production of red blood cells. Both practices are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.

== History ==
The first person to describe red blood cells was the young Dutch biologist Jan Swammerdam, who had used an early microscope in 1658 to study the blood of a frog. Unaware of this work, Anton van Leeuwenhoek provided another microscopic description in 1674, this time providing a more precise description of red blood cells, even approximating their size, &quot;25,000 times smaller than a fine grain of sand&quot;.

In the 1740s, Vincenzo Menghini in Bologna was able to demonstrate the presence of iron by passing magnets over the powder or ash remaining from heated red blood cells.

In 1901, Karl Landsteiner published his discovery of the three main blood groups—A, B, and C (which he later renamed to O). Landsteiner described the regular patterns in which reactions occurred when serum was mixed with red blood cells, thus identifying compatible and conflicting combinations between these blood groups. A year later Alfred von Decastello and Adriano Sturli, two colleagues of Landsteiner, identified a fourth blood group—AB.

In 1959, by use of X-ray crystallography, Max Perutz was able to unravel the structure of hemoglobin, the red blood cell protein that carries oxygen.

The oldest intact red blood cells ever discovered were found in Ötzi the Iceman, a natural mummy of a man who died around 3255 BCE. These cells were discovered in May 2012.

<text>A blood cell (also called a hematopoietic cell, hemocyte, or hematocyte) is a cell produced through hematopoiesis and found mainly in the blood. Major types of blood cells include red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). Together, these three kinds of blood cells add up to a total 45% of the blood tissue by volume, with the remaining 55% of the volume composed of plasma, the liquid component of blood.

==Red blood cells==

Red blood cells or &quot;erythrocytes&quot; primarily carry oxygen and collect carbon dioxide through the use of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that gives red blood cells their color and facilitates transportation of oxygen from the lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs to be exhaled. Red blood cells are the most abundant cell in the blood, accounting for about 40–45% of its volume. Red blood cells are circular, biconcave, disk-shaped and deformable to allow them to squeeze through narrow capillaries. They do not have a nucleus. Red blood cells are much smaller than most other human cells.

RBCs are formed in the red bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells in a process known as erythropoiesis. In adults, about 2.4 million RBCs are produced each second. The normal RBCs count is 4.5 to 5 millions per cu.mm. RBCs have a lifespan of approximately 100-120 days. After they have completed their lifespan, they are removed from the bloodstream by the spleen.

Mature red blood cells are unique among cells in the human body in that they lack a nucleus (although erythroblasts do have a nucleus).

The condition of having too few red blood cells is known as anemia, while having too many is polycythemia.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the rate at which RBCs sink to the bottom (when placed in a vertical column after adding an anticoagulant). Normal values of ESR are:

• 3 to 5 mm per hour in males.

• 4 to 7 mm per hour in females.

==White blood cells==

White blood cells or &quot;leukocytes&quot;, are cells of the immune system involved in defending the body against both infectious disease and foreign materials. They are produced and derived from multipotent cells in the bone marrow known as hematopoietic stem cells. Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic system. There are a variety of types of white blood cells that serve specific roles in the human immune system. WBCs constitute approximately 1% of the blood volume.

White blood cells are divided into granulocytes and agranulocytes, distinguished by the presence or absence of granules in the cytoplasm. Granulocytes include basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, and mast cells. Agranulocytes include lymphocytes and monocytes.

The condition of having too few white blood cells is leukopenia, while having too many is leukocytosis. There are individual terms for the lack or overabundance of specific types of white blood cells. The number of white blood cells in circulation is commonly increased in the incidence of infection. Many hematological cancers are based on the inappropriate production of white blood cells.

==Platelets==

Platelets, or &quot;thrombocytes&quot;, are very small, irregularly shaped clear cell fragments, 2–3 μm in diameter, which derive from fragmentation of megakaryocytes. The average lifespan of a platelet is normally just 5 to 9 days. Platelets are a natural source of growth factors. They circulate in the blood of mammals and are involved in hemostasis, leading to the formation of blood clots. Platelets release thread-like fibers to form these clots.

The normal range (99% of population analyzed) for platelets is 150,000 to 450,000 per cubic millimeter. If the number of platelets is too low, excessive bleeding can occur. However, if the number of platelets is too high, blood clots can form thrombosis, which may obstruct blood vessels and result in such events as a stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or blockage of blood vessels to other parts of the body, such as the extremities of the arms or legs. An abnormality or disease of the platelets is called a thrombocytopathy, which can be either a low number of platelets (thrombocytopenia), a decrease in function of platelets (thrombasthenia), or an increase in the number of platelets (thrombocytosis). There are disorders that reduce the number of platelets, such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), that typically cause thromboses, or clots, instead of bleeding.

Platelets release a multitude of growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent chemotactic agent, and TGF beta, which stimulates the deposition of extracellular matrix. Both of these growth factors have been shown to play a significant role in the repair and regeneration of connective tissues. Other healing-associated growth factors produced by platelets include basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), platelet-derived epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Local application of these factors in increased concentrations through platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been used as an adjunct to wound healing for several decades.

==Complete blood count==

A complete blood count (CBC) is a test panel requested by a doctor or other medical professional that gives information about the cells in a patient&#x27;s blood. A scientist or lab technician performs the requested testing and provides the requesting medical professional with the results of the CBC. In the past, counting the cells in a patient&#x27;s blood was performed manually, by viewing a slide prepared with a sample of the patient&#x27;s blood under a microscope. Today, this process is generally automated by use of an automated analyzer, with only approximately 10-20% of samples now being examined manually. Abnormally high or low counts may indicate the presence of many forms of disease, and hence blood counts are amongst the most commonly performed blood tests in medicine, as they can provide an overview of a patient&#x27;s general health status.

==Discovery==

In 1658 Dutch naturalist Jan Swammerdam was the first person to observe red blood cells under a microscope, and in 1695, microscopist Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, also Dutch, was the first to draw an illustration of &quot;red corpuscles&quot;, as they were called. No further blood cells were discovered until 1842 when French physician Alfred Donné discovered platelets. The following year leukocytes were first observed by Gabriel Andral, a French professor of medicine, and William Addison, a British physician, simultaneously. Both men believed that both red and white cells were altered in disease. With these discoveries, hematology, a new field of medicine, was established. Even though agents for staining tissues and cells were available, almost no advances were made in knowledge about the morphology of blood cells until 1879, when Paul Ehrlich published his technique for staining blood films and his method for differential blood cell counting.

<text>Kenneth Martin Follett (born 5 June 1949) is a Welsh author of thrillers and historical novels who has sold more than 195 million copies of his works.

Follett&#x27;s commercial breakthrough came with the spy thriller &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; (1978). After writing more best-sellers in the genre in the 1980s, he branched into historical fiction with &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; (1989), an epic set in medieval England which became his best-known work and the first published in the &quot;Kingsbridge&quot; series. He has continued to write in both genres, including the &quot;Century Trilogy&quot;. Many of his books have achieved high ranking on bestseller lists, including the number-one position on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

== Early life and education ==
Follett was born on 5 June 1949 in Cardiff, Wales. He was the first child of Martin Follett, a tax inspector, and Lavinia (Veenie) Follett, who went on to have two more children, Hannah and James. Barred from watching films and television by his Plymouth Brethren parents, he developed an early interest in reading but remained an indifferent student until he entered his teens. His family moved to London when he was ten years old, and he began applying himself to his studies at Harrow Weald Grammar School and Poole Technical College.

In 1967, he was admitted to University College London, where he studied philosophy and became active in center-left politics. He married Mary in 1968, and their son, Emanuele, was born the same year. After graduating in 1970, he completed a three-month postgraduate journalism course and began working as a trainee reporter for the &quot;South Wales Echo&quot; in Cardiff. In 1973, his daughter, Marie-Claire, was born.

== Career ==

After three years in Cardiff, he returned to London as a general-assignment reporter for the &quot;Evening News&quot;. Finding the work unchallenging, he eventually left journalism for publishing and became, by the late 1970s, deputy managing director of the small London publisher Everest Books. He began writing fiction during evenings and weekends as a hobby. Later, he said, he began writing books when he needed £200 to fix his car, and the publishers&#x27; advance a fellow journalist had been paid for a thriller was £200.

=== Further successes ===

Success came gradually at first, but the 1978 publication of &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;, which became an international bestseller and sold over 10 million copies, made him both wealthy and internationally famous.

Each of Follett&#x27;s subsequent novels has become a best-seller, ranking high on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list; a number have been adapted for the screen. As of January 2018, he had published 44 books. The first five best sellers were spy thrillers: &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; (1978), &quot;Triple&quot; (1979), &quot;The Key to Rebecca &quot;(1980), &quot;The Man from St. Petersburg&quot; (1982) and &quot;Lie Down with Lions&quot; (1986). &quot;On Wings of Eagles&quot; (1983) was the true story of how two of Ross Perot&#x27;s employees were rescued from Iran during the revolution of 1979.
The next three novels, &quot;Night Over Water&quot; (1991), &quot;A Dangerous Fortune&quot; (1993) and &quot;A Place Called Freedom&quot; (1995) were more historical than thriller, but he returned to the thriller genre with &quot;The Third Twin&quot; (1996) which in the &quot;Publishing Trends&quot; annual survey of international fiction best-sellers for 1997 was ranked no. 2 worldwide, after John Grisham&#x27;s &quot;The Partner&quot;. His next work, &quot;The Hammer of Eden&quot; (1998), was another contemporary suspense story followed by a Cold War thriller, &quot;Code to Zero&quot; (2000).

Follett returned to the Second World War era with his next two novels, &quot;Jackdaws&quot; (2001), a thriller about a group of women parachuted into France to destroy a vital telephone exchange – which won the Corine Literature Prize for 2003 – and &quot;Hornet Flight&quot; (2002), about a daring young Danish couple who escape to Britain from occupied Denmark in a rebuilt Hornet Moth biplane with vital information about German radar. &quot;Whiteout&quot; (2004) is a contemporary thriller about the theft of a deadly virus from a research lab.
=== Kingsbridge series ===
Follett surprised his readers with his first non-spy thriller, &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; (1989), a novel about building a cathedral in a small English village during the Anarchy in the 12th century. The novel was highly successful, received positive reviews and was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for eighteen weeks. It topped best-seller lists in Canada, Britain and Italy, and was on the German best-seller list for six years. As of 2017 it has sold 26 million copies. On 16 August 2017, a computer game adaptation by German developer and publisher Daedalic Entertainment was released.

Its much-later sequel, &quot;World Without End&quot; (2007), returns to Kingsbridge 157 years later, and features the descendants of the characters in &quot;Pillars&quot;. It focuses on the destinies of a handful of people as their lives are devastated by the Black Death, the plague that swept Europe from the middle of the 14th century.

The next novel in the series is &quot;A Column of Fire&quot; (2017). Beginning in 1558, the story follows the romance between Ned Willard and Margery Fitzgerald over half a century. It commences at a time when Europe turns against Elizabethan England, and the queen finds herself beset by plots to dethrone her.

A fourth novel, &quot;The Evening and the Morning&quot; (2020), is a prequel to &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;. Set in the decade around 1000 AD – in the so-called Dark Ages – the story &quot;concerns the gradual creation of the town of Kingsbridge and of the many people – priests, nobles, peasants, the enslaved – who played significant roles&quot;. As such, the book provides &quot;a solid underpinning to the later installments of the Kingsbridge series&quot;.

A fifth novel, &quot;The Armour of Light&quot; (2023). The novel is set in 1792, around the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The book explores the societal upheaval following the invention of the Spinning Jenny in 1770, marking the dawn of industrialization. Set against the backdrop of Napoleonic wars and economic transformation, it follows interconnected characters: a widow coping with her husband’s death in a factory accident, a young woman funding a school for impoverished children, a man inheriting a failing business, and a wealthy industrialist protecting his fortune at all costs. Amid war and social change, the story examines the human cost of progress and the struggle to rebuild a fractured world.

The series has been described as being &quot;as comprehensive an account of the building of a civilization – with its laws, structures, customs and beliefs – as you are likely to encounter anywhere in popular fiction&quot;.

=== Century trilogy ===

Follett&#x27;s novels, &quot;Fall of Giants&quot;, &quot;Winter of the World&quot; and &quot;Edge of Eternity&quot;, make up the Century Trilogy. &quot;Fall of Giants&quot; (2010) followed the fates of five interrelated families – Welsh, American, German, Russian and English – as they moved through the world-shaking dramas of the First World War, the Russian Revolution and the struggle for women&#x27;s suffrage. &quot;Fall of Giants&quot;, published simultaneously in 14 countries, was internationally popular and topped several best-seller lists.

&quot;Winter of the World&quot; (2012) picks up where the first book left off, as its five interrelated families enter a time of enormous social, political, and economic turmoil, beginning with the rise of Nazi Germany, through the Spanish Civil War and the great dramas of World War II, to the explosions of the American and Soviet atom bombs and the beginning of the long Cold War.

The final novel in the &#x27;Century&#x27; trilogy, &quot;Edge of Eternity&quot;, which follows those families through the events of the second half of the 20th century, was published on 16 September 2014. Like the previous two books, it chronicles the lives of five families through the Cold War and civil-rights movements.

A major element of the first two volumes, &quot;Fall of Giants&quot; and &quot;Winter of the World&quot;, is the increasing political assertiveness of the British working class and the rise of the British Labour Party – exemplified by the Williams Family, Welsh coal miners, of which several viewpoint characters end up as Members of the British Parliament and one of them becomes a cabinet minister in Clement Attlee&#x27;s post-WWII Labour government. However, the theme of British politics is nearly absent from the third part &quot;Edge of Eternity&quot;, which concentrates on the Cold War on the one hand and the US Civil Rights Movement on the other; for example, though the novel continues until 1989, it makes no reference at all to the rise of Margaret Thatcher in 1979.

== Adaptations ==

Follett has had a number of novels made into films and television mini series: &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; was made into an acclaimed film, starring Donald Sutherland, and six novels have been made into television mini-series: &quot;The Key to Rebecca&quot;, &quot;Lie Down with Lions&quot;, &quot;On Wings of Eagles&quot; (1986), &quot;The Third Twin&quot; – the rights for which were sold to CBS for $US1,400,000, a record price at the time – and &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; (2010) and &quot;World Without End&quot; (2012).

A video game adaptation titled &quot;Ken Follett&#x27;s The Pillars of the Earth&quot;, developed and published by German studio Daedalic Entertainment, was released in three parts from 2017 to 2018.

Follett had cameo roles as the valet in &quot;The Third Twin&quot; and later as a merchant in &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;. In 2016, &quot;A Dangerous Fortune&quot; was also adapted.

&quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; and &quot;A Column of Fire&quot; have both been adapted into Danish-language musicals. &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; had its world premiere October 12, 2016 at Østre Gasværk Teater, Copenhagen. &quot;A Column of Fire&quot; had its world premiere in 2019 at Bellevue Teatret, Klampenborg. Both of the musicals were written by Thomas Høg, Lasse Aagaard, and Sune Svanekier.

<doc id="67161" wikidata="Q297040" url="?curid=67161" title="Apollonius of Tyana">
<text>Apollonius of Tyana (; ; ) was a first-century Greek philosopher and religious leader from the town of Tyana, Cappadocia in Roman Anatolia, who spent his life travelling and teaching in the Middle East, North Africa and India. He is a central figure in Neopythagoreanism and was one of the most famous &quot;miracle workers&quot; of his day.

His exceptional personality and his mystical way of life, which was regarded as exemplary, impressed his contemporaries and had a lasting cultural influence. Numerous legends surrounding him and accounts of his life are contained in the extensive &quot;Life of Apollonius&quot;, which contains a large part of the legendary material about Apollonius&#x27; life and work. Many of the ancient legends of Apollonius consist of numerous reports about miracles that he was said to have performed as a wandering sage with his lifelong companion Damis. 

He was tried for allegedly having used magic as a means of conspiring against the emperor; after his conviction and subsequent death-penalty, his followers believed he underwent heavenly ascension. Most modern scholars of antiquity agree that Apollonius existed historically.

==Life dates==
Apollonius was born into a respected and wealthy aristocratic Greek household. His primary biographer, Philostratus the Elder (), places him , however, the Roman historian Cassius Dio () writes that Apollonius was in his 40s or 50s in the 90s AD, from which the scholar Maria Dzielska gives a birth year of about AD 40.
==Sources==
The earliest and by far the most detailed source is the &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;, a lengthy, novelistic biography written by the sophist Philostratus at the request of empress Julia Domna, wife of Septimius Severus. She died in AD 217, and he completed it after her death, probably in the 220s or 230s AD. Philostratus&#x27;s account shaped the image of Apollonius for posterity. To some extent it is a valuable source because it contains data from older writings that were available to Philostratus but disappeared later on. Among these works are an excerpt (preserved by Eusebius) from &quot;On Sacrifices&quot;, and certain alleged letters of Apollonius. The sage may have actually written some of these works, along with the no-longer extant &quot;Life of Pythagoras&quot;. At least two biographical sources that Philostratus used are lost: a book by the imperial secretary Maximus describing Apollonius&#x27;s activities in Maximus&#x27;s home city of Aegaeae in Aeolis and a biography by a certain Moiragenes. There also survives, separately from the life by Philostratus, a collection of letters of Apollonius, but at least some of these seem to be spurious.

One of the essential sources Philostratus claimed to know are the &quot;memoirs&quot; (or &quot;diary&quot;) of Damis, an acolyte and companion of Apollonius. Some scholars claim that the notebooks of Damis were an invention of Philostratus, while others think it could have been a real book forged by someone else and naively used by Philostratus. Philostratus describes Apollonius as a wandering teacher of philosophy and miracle-worker who was mainly active in Greece and Asia Minor but also traveled to Italy, Spain, and North Africa, and even to Mesopotamia, India, and Ethiopia. In particular, he tells lengthy stories of Apollonius entering the city of Rome in disregard of emperor Nero&#x27;s ban on philosophers, and later on being summoned, as a defendant, to the court of Domitian, where he defied the emperor in blunt terms. He had allegedly been accused of conspiring against the emperor, performing human sacrifice, and predicting a plague by means of magic. Philostratus implies that upon his death, Apollonius of Tyana entered heaven.

How much of this can be accepted as historical truth depends largely on the extent to which modern scholars trust Philostratus, and in particular on whether they believe in the reality of Damis. Some of these scholars contend that Apollonius never came to Western Europe and was virtually unknown there until the 3rd century AD, when Empress Julia Domna, who was herself from the province of Syria, decided to popularize him and his teachings in Rome. For that purpose, so these same scholars believe, she commissioned Philostratus to write the biography, in which Apollonius is exalted as a fearless sage with supernatural powers, even greater than Pythagoras. This view of Julia Domna&#x27;s role in the making of the Apollonius legend gets some support from the fact that her son Caracalla worshipped him, and her grandnephew emperor Severus Alexander may have done so as well.

Apollonius was also a well-known figure in the Islamic world, being referred to by the name &quot;Balinus&quot;.

==Biography==
===Historical facts===
With the exception of the Adana Inscription from the 3rd or 4th century AD, little can be derived from sources other than Philostratus.

The Adana Inscription has been translated by C.P. Jones as: &quot;This man, named after Apollo, and shining forth from Tyana, extinguished the faults of men. The tomb in Tyana (received) his body, but in truth, heaven received him so that he might drive out the pains of men (or: drive pains from among men).&quot; It is thought to have been brought from Cilicia, perhaps Aegae (Cilicia). However, Miroslav Marcovich translates part of the text as: &quot;Sure enough, Apollonius was born in Tyana, but the full truth is that he was a heaven-sent sage and healer, a new Pythagoras.&quot;

As James Francis put it, &quot;the most that can be said ... is that Apollonius appears to have been a wandering ascetic/philosopher/wonderworker of a type common to the eastern part of the early empire.&quot; What we can safely assume is that he was indeed a Pythagorean and as such, in conformity with the Pythagorean tradition, opposed animal sacrifice and lived on a frugal, strictly vegetarian diet. A minimalist view is that he spent his entire life in the cities of his native Asia Minor (Turkey) and of northern Syria, in particular his home town of Tyana, Ephesus, Aegae and Antioch, though the letters suggest wider travels, and there seems no reason to deny that, like many wandering philosophers, he at least visited Rome. As for his philosophical convictions, we have an interesting, probably authentic fragment of one of his writings (&quot;On sacrifices&quot;), in which he expresses his view that God, who is the most beautiful being, cannot be influenced by prayers or sacrifices and has no wish to be worshipped by humans, but can be reached by a spiritual procedure involving &quot;nous&quot; (intellect), because he himself is pure nous, and nous is the greatest faculty of humankind.

=== Miracles ===
Philostratus implies on one occasion that Apollonius had extra-sensory perception (Book VIII, Chapter XXVI). When emperor Domitian was murdered on 18 September AD 96, Apollonius was said to have witnessed the event in Ephesus &quot;about midday&quot; on the day it happened in Rome, and told those present &quot;Take heart, gentlemen, for the tyrant has been slain this day ...&quot;. Both Philostratus and renowned historian Cassius Dio report this incident, probably on the basis of an oral tradition. Both state that the philosopher welcomed the deed as praiseworthy tyrannicide.

=== Journey to India ===
Philostratus devoted two and a half of the eight books of his &quot;Life of Apollonius&quot; (1.19–3.58) to the description of a journey of his hero to India. It&#x27;s possible that the sage of Tyana indeed traveled to India, and it&#x27;s also &quot;entirely plausible&quot; that he was attributed with this journey even before Philostratus.

According to Philostratus&#x27; &quot;Life&quot;, en route to the Far East, Apollonius reached Hierapolis Bambyce (Manbij) in Syria (not Nineveh, as some scholars believed), where he met Damis, a native of that city who became his lifelong companion. Pythagoras, whom the Neo-Pythagoreans regarded as an exemplary sage, was believed to have traveled to India. Hence such a feat made Apollonius look like a good Pythagorean who spared no pains in his efforts to discover the sources of oriental piety and wisdom. As some details in Philostratus&#x27; account of the Indian adventure seem incompatible with known facts, modern scholars are inclined to dismiss the whole story as a fanciful fabrication, but not all of them rule out the possibility that the Tyanean actually did visit India. Philostratus has him meet Phraotes, the Indo-Parthian king of Taxila, a city located in northern Ancient India in what is now northern Pakistan, around AD 46. And the description that Philostratus provides of Taxila comports with modern archaeological excavations at the ancient site.

What seemed to be independent evidence showing that Apollonius was known in India has now been proven a forgery. In two Sanskrit texts quoted by Sanskritist Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya in 1943 he appears as &quot;Apalūnya&quot;, in one of them together with Damis (called &quot;Damīśa&quot;), it is claimed that Apollonius and Damis were Western yogis, who later on were converted to the correct Advaita philosophy. Some have believed that these Indian sources derived their information from a Sanskrit translation of Philostratus&#x27; work (which would have been a most uncommon and amazing occurrence), or even considered the possibility that it was really an independent confirmation of the historicity of the journey to India. Only in 1995 were the passages in the Sanskrit texts proven to be interpolations by a late 19th-century forger.

== Writings ==
Several writings and many letters have been ascribed to Apollonius, but some of them are lost; others have only been preserved in parts or fragments of disputed authenticity. Porphyry and Iamblichus refer to a biography of Pythagoras by Apollonius, which has not survived; it is also mentioned in the &quot;Suda&quot;. Apollonius wrote a treatise, &quot;On sacrifices&quot;, of which only a short, probably authentic fragment has come down to us.

Philostratus&#x27; &quot;Life&quot; and the anthology assembled by Joannes Stobaeus contain purported letters of Apollonius. Some of them are cited in full, others only partially. There is also an independently transmitted collection of letters preserved in medieval manuscripts. It is difficult to determine what is authentic and what not. Some of the letters may have been forgeries or literary exercises assembled in collections which were already circulated in the 2nd century AD. It has been asserted that Philostratus himself forged a considerable part of the letters he inserted into his work; others were older forgeries available to him.

==Comparisons with Jesus==
In Philostratus&#x27;s description of Apollonius&#x27;s life and deeds, there are a number of similarities with the life and especially the claimed miracles of Jesus. In the late 3rd century Porphyry, an anti-Christian Neoplatonic philosopher, claimed in his treatise &quot;Against the Christians&quot; that the miracles of Jesus were not unique, and mentioned Apollonius as a non-Christian who had accomplished similar achievements. During the Diocletianic Persecution, some writers cited Apollonius as an example in their polemics. Hierocles, one of the campaigners for a stronger policy against Christians, wrote a pamphlet where he argued that Apollonius exceeded Christ as a wonder-worker and yet wasn&#x27;t worshipped as a god and that the cultured biographers of Apollonius were more trustworthy than the uneducated apostles. This attempt to make Apollonius a hero of the anti-Christian movement provoked sharp replies from bishop Eusebius of Caesarea and from Lactantius. Eusebius wrote an extant reply to the pamphlet of Hierocles (&quot;Contra Hieroclem&quot;), where he claimed that Philostratus was a fabulist and that Apollonius was a sorcerer in league with demons.

Comparisons between Apollonius and Jesus became commonplace in the 17th and 18th centuries in the context of polemic about Christianity. Several advocates of Enlightenment, deism and anti-Church positions saw him as an early forerunner of their own ethical and religious ideas, a proponent of a universal, non-denominational religion compatible with reason. These comparisons continued into the 20th century.

* In 1680, Charles Blount, a radical English deist, published the first English translation of the first two books of Philostratus&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; with an anti-Church introduction.
* In the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man&quot;, the Dying Man compares Jesus to Apollonius as a false prophet.
* In his 1909 book &quot;The Christ&quot;, John Remsburg postulated that the religion of Apollonius disappeared because the proper conditions for its development did not exist. Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam thrived, however, because the existing conditions were favorable.
* Some early- to mid-20th-century Theosophists, notably C. W. Leadbeater, Alice A. Bailey and Benjamin Creme, have maintained that Apollonius of Tyana was the reincarnation of the being they call the Master Jesus. Helena Blavatsky in 1881 refers to Apollonius of Tyana as &quot;the great thaumaturgist of the second century AD&quot;.
* In the mid 20th century, the American expatriate poet Ezra Pound evoked Apollonius in his later &quot;Cantos&quot; as a figure associated with sun-worship and as a messianic rival to Christ. Pound identified him as Aryan within an antisemitic mythology, and celebrated his Sun worship and aversion to ancient Jewish animal sacrifice.
* In Gerald Messadié&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Became God&quot;, Apollonius appeared as a wandering philosopher and magician of about the same age as Jesus.
* Edward Gibbon compared Apollonius to Jesus in the footnotes to &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, saying &quot;Apollonius of Tyana was born about the same time as Jesus Christ. His life (that of the former) is related in so fabulous a manner by his disciples, that we are at a loss to discover whether he was a sage, an imposter, or a fanatic.&quot; This led to controversy, as critics believed Gibbon was alluding to Jesus being a fanatic.
* Biblical scholar Bart D. Ehrman relates that he begins his introductory class on the New Testament, by describing an important figure from the first century without first revealing he is talking about the stories attached to Apollonius of Tyana:
Proponents of the Christ myth theory sometimes cite Apollonius as an example of the mythic hero archetype that they allege applies to Jesus as well. However, Erkki Koskenniemi has stated that Apollonius of Tyana is not a representative of a Hellenistic divine man and that there is no evidence that Christians constructed their paradigm of Jesus based on traditions associated with him. Moreover, the Christ myth theory is considered a fringe theory in scholarship and is generally not taken seriously.

== Impact ==

=== Antiquity ===
In the 2nd century the satirist Lucian of Samosata was a sharp critic of Neo-Pythagoreanism. After AD 180 he wrote a pamphlet wherein he attacked Alexander of Abonoteichus, a student of one of Apollonius&#x27;s students, as a charlatan and suggested that the whole school was based on fraud. From this we can infer that Apollonius really had students and that his school survived at least until Lucian&#x27;s time. One of Philostratus&#x27;s foremost aims was to oppose this view. Although he related various miraculous feats of Apollonius, he emphasized at the same time that his hero was not a magician but a serious philosopher and a champion of traditional Greek values.

When Emperor Aurelian conducted his military campaign against the Palmyrene Empire, he captured Tyana in AD 272. According to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; he abstained from destroying the city after having a vision of Apollonius admonishing him to spare the innocent citizens.

In Late Antiquity talismans made by Apollonius appeared in several cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, as if they were sent from heaven. They were magical figures and columns erected in public places, meant to protect the cities from afflictions. The great popularity of these talismans was a challenge to the Christians. Some Byzantine authors condemned them as sorcery and the work of demons, others admitted that such magic was beneficial; none of them claimed that it didn&#x27;t work.

In the Western Roman Empire, Sidonius Apollinaris was a Christian admirer of Apollonius in the 5th century. He produced a Latin translation of Philostratus&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;, which is lost.

=== The Middle Ages ===
During the medieval period, a number of works related to Hermetic philosophy and medieval European magic were falsely attributed to Apollonius of Tyana which spanned the Greek, Arabic, and Latin traditions. 

In the Greek tradition, there is &quot;The Book of Wisdom&quot; (Greek &quot;Biblos Sophias&quot;) which is a twelfth-century astrological magic book that dates to the fifth century but survives only as late as the fifteenth century[unclear]. &quot;The Book of Wisdom&quot; may also have survived in the Latin and Arabic traditions as having been published and distributed as a series of short separate tracts or chapters under a variety of different titles. 

In the Latin tradition, there is the &quot;Golden Flowers&quot; (Latin &quot;Flores Aurei&quot;) which is a thirteenth-century book of angelic magic which supposedly contains Apollonius&#x27; select extracts and prayers from the mythical and lost &quot;Book of Flowers of Heavenly Teaching&quot; (Latin &quot;Liber Florum Caelestis Doctrinae&quot;) compiled by King Solomon. The &quot;Golden Flowers&quot; was later compiled with its own derivative text called the &quot;New Art&quot; (Latin &quot;Ars Nova&quot;) which would later become known as &quot;The Notory Art&quot; (Latin &quot;Ars Notoria&quot;). The &quot;Notory Art&quot; explains that Apollonius of Tyana is the spiritual successor to King Solomon&#x27;s angelic magic; for this reason, &quot;The Notory Art&quot; is often classified as belonging to the Pseudo-Solomonic corpus of magical literature. Another pseudepigraphal Latin work attributed to Apollonius of Tyana is the lost &quot;On Making Angelic Things&quot; (&quot;De Angelica Factura&quot; or &quot;De Angelica Factione&quot;) cited by the Italian university professor Cecco d&#x27;Ascoli in his commentary on the Sphere of the Cosmos by John de Sacrobosco. Another falsely attributed work is &quot;On the Seven Figures of the Seven Planets&quot; (&quot;Liber De Septem Figuris Septem Planetarum&quot;) which describes the seven magic squares attributed to the seven classical planets.

In the Arabic tradition, Apollonius of Tyana is called the &quot;Master of the Talismans&quot; (&quot;Sahib at-tilasmat&quot;) and known as Balinus (or, Balinas, Belenus, or Abuluniyus). The ninth-century &quot;Book of Balinas the Wise: On the Causes, or, the Book of the Secret of Creation&quot; (&quot;Kitab Balaniyus al-Hakim fi&#x27;l- &#x27;llal, Kitab Sirr al-khaliqa wa-san &#x27;at al-tabi&#x27;a&quot;) expounds upon the origins of the cosmos and its causes in six chapters and narrates the story of how Apollonius entered the crypt of Hermes Trismegistus to discover the Emerald Tablet (&quot;Tabula Smaragdina&quot;) which became a foundational text of alchemy. In this way, Apollonius of Tyana becomes the philosophical and alchemical successor to Hermes Trismegistus. Another Arabic book falsely attributed to Apollonius is the &quot;Treatise on Magic&quot; (&quot;Risalat al-Sihr&quot;) cited within the &quot;Great Introduction to the Treatise on Spirits and Talismans&quot; which was translated by Hunayn ibn Ishaq (&quot;al-Mudkhal al-Kabir ila &#x27;ilm af &#x27;al al-Ruhaniyat waw Talassimat&quot;). The &quot;Treatise on Magic&quot; might be the same work under its Latin titles &quot;De Hyle&quot; and &quot;De Arte Magica&quot; as cited by Cecco d&#x27;Ascoli.

=== Modern era ===

Beginning in the early 16th century, there was great interest in Apollonius in Europe, but the traditional ecclesiastical viewpoint prevailed, and until the Age of Enlightenment the Tyanean was usually treated as a demonic magician and a great enemy of the Church who collaborated with the devil and tried to overthrow Christianity.

Eliphas Levi made three attempts to raise the shade of Apollonius of Tyana by occult ritual, as described in his textbook on magic &quot;Dogme de la magie&quot; (1854).

=== Apollonius of Tyana in Baháʼí Scripture ===
The &quot;Tablet of Wisdom&quot;, written by Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, names &quot;Balinus&quot; (Apollonius) as a great philosopher, who &quot;surpassed everyone else in the diffusion of arts and sciences and soared unto the loftiest heights of humility and supplication.&quot; In another text Baháʼu&#x27;lláh states that he &quot;derived his knowledge and sciences from the Hermetic Tablets and most of the philosophers who followed him made their philosophical and scientific discoveries from his words and statements&quot;.

=== Apollonius of Tyana in contemporary literature and film ===
Edward Bulwer-Lytton refers to Apollonius in &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; and &quot;Zanoni&quot; as a great master of occult power and wisdom.

Apollonius appears in Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s novel &quot;The Temptation of Saint Anthony&quot;, where he tempts the titular saint with divine wisdom and the power to perform miracles. As a miracle worker and neo-Pythagorean philosopher, the character of Apollonius is used as a bridge between the two sections of the book covering the temptations of human sages and the temptations of the gods. 

Apollonius of Tyana is a major character in Steven Saylor&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Empire&quot;, which depicts his confrontation with the harsh Emperor Domitian. Apollonius is shown confounding the Emperor (and many others) in quick-witted dialogue, reminiscent of Socrates. The book&#x27;s plot leaves ambiguous the issue of whether Apollonius possessed true magical power or that he was able to use suggestion and other clever tricks.

Avram Davidson&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Masters of the Maze&quot; has Apollonius of Tyana as one of a select group of humans (and other sentient beings) who had penetrated to the center of a mysterious &quot;Maze&quot; traversing all of space and time. There he dwells in eternal repose, in company with the Biblical Enoch, the Chinese King Wen and Lao Tze, the 19th-century Briton Bathurst, and various other sages of the past and future, some of them Martians.

In &quot;The Circus of Dr. Lao&quot; (1935) by Charles G. Finney, Apollonius appears in the employ of Dr. Lao&#x27;s circus and brings a dead man back to life. Apollonius of Tyana is one of the 7 circus characters portrayed by Tony Randall in the 1964 film &quot;The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao&quot;. This character does not have any philosophical context, rather he is a sideshow attraction similar to a fortune-teller who, besides being blind, has been blessed with clairvoyance. While he always speaks the truth, ugly or not, about the future, he is accursed with an ironic fate - nobody ever believes what he says.

In television, Apollonius of Tyana was portrayed by Mel Ferrer in &quot;The Fantastic Journey&quot; episode entitled “Funhouse”. Apollonius was banished centuries ago to a time zone by the gods for opposing them. When the time zone travelers led by the 23rd century healer and pacifist named Varian arrive at a seemingly abandoned carnival, Apollonius intends to lure them into his funhouse of horrors so that he can possess the body of one of the travelers and escape his eternal imprisonment.

Keats&#x27; poem &quot;Lamia&quot; mentions and discusses Apollonius.

<text>The placenta (: placentas or placentae) is a temporary embryonic and later fetal organ that begins developing from the blastocyst shortly after implantation. It plays critical roles in facilitating nutrient, gas and waste exchange between the physically separate maternal and fetal circulations, and is an important endocrine organ, producing hormones that regulate both maternal and fetal physiology during pregnancy. The placenta connects to the fetus via the umbilical cord, and on the opposite aspect to the maternal uterus in a species-dependent manner. In humans, a thin layer of maternal decidual (endometrial) tissue comes away with the placenta when it is expelled from the uterus following birth (sometimes incorrectly referred to as the &#x27;maternal part&#x27; of the placenta). Placentas are a defining characteristic of placental mammals, but are also found in marsupials and some non-mammals with varying levels of development.

Mammalian placentas probably first evolved about 150 million to 200 million years ago. The protein syncytin, found in the outer barrier of the placenta (the syncytiotrophoblast) between mother and fetus, has a certain RNA signature in its genome that has led to the hypothesis that it originated from an ancient retrovirus: essentially a virus that helped pave the transition from egg-laying to live-birth.

The word &quot;placenta&quot; comes from the Latin word for a type of cake, from Greek πλακόεντα/πλακοῦντα &quot;plakóenta/plakoúnta&quot;, accusative of πλακόεις/πλακούς &quot;plakóeis/plakoús&quot;, &quot;flat, slab-like&quot;, with reference to its round, flat appearance in humans. The classical plural is &quot;placentae&quot;, but the form &quot;placentas&quot; is more common in modern English.

==Evolution and phylogenetic diversity==
The placenta has evolved independently multiple times, probably starting in fish, where it originated multiple times, including the genus &quot;Poeciliopsis.&quot; Placentation has also evolved in some reptiles.

The mammalian placenta evolved more than 100 million years ago and was a critical factor in the explosive diversification of placental mammals. Although all mammalian placentas have the same functions, there are important differences in structure and function in different groups of mammals. For example, human, bovine, equine and canine placentas are very different at both the gross and the microscopic levels. Placentas of these species also differ in their ability to provide maternal immunoglobulins to the fetus.

== Structure ==
Placental mammals, including humans, have a chorioallantoic placenta that forms from the chorion and allantois. In humans, the placenta averages 22 cm (9 inch) in length and 2–2.5 cm (0.8–1 inch) in thickness, with the center being the thickest, and the edges being the thinnest. It typically weighs approximately 500 grams (just over 1 lb). It has a dark reddish-blue or crimson color. It connects to the fetus by an umbilical cord of approximately 55–60 cm (22–24 inch) in length, which contains two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein. The umbilical cord inserts into the chorionic plate (has an eccentric attachment). Vessels branch out over the surface of the placenta and further divide to form a network covered by a thin layer of cells. This results in the formation of villous tree structures. On the maternal side, these villous tree structures are grouped into lobules called cotyledons. In humans, the placenta usually has a disc shape, but size varies vastly between different mammalian species.

The placenta occasionally takes a form in which it comprises several distinct parts connected by blood vessels. The parts, called lobes, may number two, three, four, or more. Such placentas are described as bilobed/bilobular/bipartite, trilobed/trilobular/tripartite, and so on. If there is a clearly discernible main lobe and auxiliary lobe, the latter is called a &quot;succenturiate placenta&quot;. Sometimes the blood vessels connecting the lobes get in the way of fetal presentation during labor, which is called &quot;vasa previa&quot;.

=== Gene and protein expression ===

About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal mature placenta. Some 350 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the placenta and fewer than 100 genes are highly placenta specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly expressed in trophoblasts and have functions related to pregnancy. Examples of proteins with elevated expression in placenta compared to other organs and tissues are PEG10 and the cancer testis antigen PAGE4 and expressed in cytotrophoblasts, CSH1 and KISS1 expressed in syncytiotrophoblasts, and PAPPA2 and PRG2 expressed in extravillous trophoblasts.

==Physiology==

===Development===

The placenta begins to develop upon implantation of the blastocyst into the maternal endometrium, very early on in pregnancy at about week 4.

The outer layer of the late blastocyst, is formed of trophoblasts, cells that form the outer layer of the placenta. This outer layer is divided into two further layers: the underlying cytotrophoblast layer and the overlying syncytiotrophoblast layer. The syncytiotrophoblast is a multinucleated continuous cell layer that covers the surface of the placenta. It forms as a result of differentiation and fusion of the underlying cytotrophoblasts, a process that continues throughout placental development. The syncytiotrophoblast contributes to the barrier function of the placenta.

The placenta grows throughout pregnancy. Development of the maternal blood supply to the placenta is complete by the end of the first trimester of pregnancy week 14 (DM).

===Placental circulation===
====Maternal placental circulation====
In preparation for implantation of the blastocyst, the endometrium undergoes decidualization. Spiral arteries in the decidua are remodeled so that they become less convoluted and their diameter is increased. The increased diameter and straighter flow path both act to increase maternal blood flow to the placenta. There is relatively high pressure as the maternal blood fills intervillous space through these spiral arteries which bathe the fetal villi in blood, allowing an exchange of gases to take place. In humans and other hemochorial placentals, the maternal blood comes into direct contact with the fetal chorion, though no fluid is exchanged. As the pressure decreases between pulses, the deoxygenated blood flows back through the endometrial veins.

Maternal blood flow begins between days 5–12, and is approximately 600–700 ml/min at term.

====Fetoplacental circulation====

Deoxygenated fetal blood passes through umbilical arteries to the placenta. At the junction of umbilical cord and placenta, the umbilical arteries branch radially to form chorionic arteries. Chorionic arteries, in turn, branch into cotyledon arteries. In the villi, these vessels eventually branch to form an extensive arterio-capillary-venous system, bringing the fetal blood extremely close to the maternal blood; but no intermingling of fetal and maternal blood occurs (&quot;placental barrier&quot;).

Endothelin and prostanoids cause vasoconstriction in placental arteries, while nitric oxide causes vasodilation. On the other hand, there is no neural vascular regulation, and catecholamines have only little effect.

The fetoplacental circulation is vulnerable to persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation, which can lead to generation of excessive free radicals. This may contribute to pre-eclampsia and other pregnancy complications. It is proposed that melatonin plays a role as an antioxidant in the placenta.

This begins at day 17–22.

===Birth===

Placental expulsion begins as a physiological separation from the wall of the uterus. The period from just after the child is born until just after the placenta is expelled is called the &quot;third stage of labor&quot;. 

Placental expulsion can be managed actively, for example by giving oxytocin via intramuscular injection followed by cord traction to assist in delivering the placenta. Alternatively, it can be managed expectantly, allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance. Blood loss and the risk of postpartum bleeding may be reduced in women offered active management of the third stage of labour, however there may be adverse effects and more research is necessary.

The habit is to cut the cord immediately after birth, but it may be no medical reason to do this; on the contrary, not cutting the cord could sometimes help the baby in its adaptation to extrauterine life, for preterm infants.

===Microbiome===

The placenta is traditionally thought to be sterile, but recent research suggests that a resident, non-pathogenic, and diverse population of microorganisms may be present in healthy tissue. However, whether these microbes exist or are clinically important is highly controversial and is the subject of active research.

==Physiology of placenta==
===Nutrition and gas exchange===
The placenta intermediates the transfer of nutrients between mother and fetus. The perfusion of the intervillous spaces of the placenta with maternal blood allows the transfer of nutrients and oxygen from the mother to the fetus and the transfer of waste products and carbon dioxide back from the fetus to the maternal blood. Nutrient transfer to the fetus can occur via both active and passive transport. Placental nutrient metabolism was found to play a key role in limiting the transfer of some nutrients. Adverse pregnancy situations, such as those involving maternal diabetes or obesity, can increase or decrease levels of nutrient transporters in the placenta potentially resulting in overgrowth or restricted growth of the fetus.

===Excretion===
Waste products excreted from the fetus such as urea, uric acid, and creatinine are transferred to the maternal blood by diffusion across the placenta.

===Immunity===
The placenta functions as a selective barrier between maternal and fetal cells, preventing maternal blood, proteins and microbes (including bacteria and most viruses) from crossing the maternal-fetal barrier.
Deterioration in placental functioning, referred to as placental insufficiency, may be related to mother-to-child transmission of some infectious diseases.
A very small number of viruses including &quot;rubella virus&quot;, &quot;Zika virus&quot; and &quot;cytomegalovirus&quot; (CMV) can travel across the placental barrier, generally taking advantage of conditions at certain gestational periods as the placenta develops. CMV and Zika travel from the maternal bloodstream via placental cells to the fetal bloodstream.

Beginning as early as 13 weeks of gestation, and increasing linearly, with the largest transfer occurring in the third trimester, IgG antibodies can pass through the human placenta, providing protection to the fetus &quot;in utero&quot;.
This passive immunity lingers for several months after birth, providing the newborn with a carbon copy of the mother&#x27;s long-term humoral immunity to see the infant through the crucial first months of extrauterine life. IgM antibodies, because of their larger size, cannot cross the placenta, one reason why infections acquired during pregnancy can be particularly hazardous for the fetus.

===Hormonal regulation===
* The first hormone released by the placenta is called the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone. This is responsible for stopping the process at the end of menses when the corpus luteum ceases activity and atrophies. If hCG did not interrupt this process, it would lead to spontaneous abortion of the fetus. The corpus luteum also produces and releases progesterone and estrogen, and hCG stimulates it to increase the amount that it releases. hCG is the indicator of pregnancy that pregnancy tests look for. These tests will work when menses has not occurred or after implantation has happened on days seven to ten. hCG may also have an anti-antibody effect, protecting it from being rejected by the mother&#x27;s body. hCG also assists the male fetus by stimulating the testes to produce testosterone, which is the hormone needed to allow the sex organs of the male to grow.
* Progesterone helps the embryo implant by assisting passage through the fallopian tubes. It also affects the fallopian tubes and the uterus by stimulating an increase in secretions necessary for fetal nutrition. Progesterone, like hCG, is necessary to prevent spontaneous abortion because it prevents contractions of the uterus and is necessary for implantation.
* Estrogen is a crucial hormone in the process of proliferation. This involves the enlargement of the breasts and uterus, allowing for growth of the fetus and production of milk. Estrogen is also responsible for increased blood supply towards the end of pregnancy through vasodilation. The levels of estrogen during pregnancy can increase so that they are thirty times what a non-pregnant woman mid-cycles estrogen level would be.
* Human placental lactogen (hPL) is a hormone used in pregnancy to develop fetal metabolism and general growth and development. Human placental lactogen works with growth hormone to stimulate insulin-like growth factor production and regulating intermediary metabolism. In the fetus, hPL acts on lactogenic receptors to modulate embryonic development, metabolism and stimulate production of IGF, insulin, surfactant and adrenocortical hormones. hPL values increase with multiple pregnancies, intact molar pregnancy, diabetes and Rh incompatibility. They are decreased with toxemia, choriocarcinoma, and Placental insufficiency.

===Immunological barrier===

The placenta and fetus may be regarded as a foreign body inside the mother and must be protected from the normal immune response of the mother that would cause it to be rejected. The placenta and fetus are thus treated as sites of immune privilege, with immune tolerance.

For this purpose, the placenta uses several mechanisms :
* It secretes neurokinin B-containing phosphocholine molecules. This is the same mechanism used by parasitic nematodes to avoid detection by the immune system of their host.
* There is presence of small lymphocytic suppressor cells in the fetus that inhibit maternal cytotoxic T cells by inhibiting the response to interleukin 2.

However, the placental barrier is not the sole means of evading the immune system, as foreign fetal cells also persist in the maternal circulation, on the other side of the placental barrier.

===DNA methylation===

The trophoblast is the outer layer of cells of the blastocyst (see day 9 in Figure, above, showing the initial stages of human embryogenesis). Placental trophoblast cells have a unique genome-wide DNA methylation pattern determined by de novo methyltransferases during embryogenesis. This methylation pattern is principally required to regulate placental development and function, which in turn is critical for embryo survival.

===Other===
The placenta also provides a reservoir of blood for the fetus, delivering blood to it in case of hypotension and vice versa, comparable to a capacitor.
==Clinical significance==
Numerous pathologies can affect the placenta.
* Placenta accreta, when the placenta implants too deeply, all the way to the actual muscle of uterine wall (without penetrating it)
* Placenta praevia, when the placement of the placenta is too close to or blocks the cervix
* Placental abruption, premature detachment of the placenta
* Placentitis, inflammation of the placenta, such as by TORCH infections.

==Society and culture==
The placenta often plays an important role in various cultures, with many societies conducting rituals regarding its disposal. In the Western world, the placenta is most often incinerated.

Some cultures bury the placenta for various reasons. The Māori of New Zealand traditionally bury the placenta from a newborn child to emphasize the relationship between humans and the earth. Likewise, the Navajo bury the placenta and umbilical cord at a specially chosen site, particularly if the baby dies during birth. In Cambodia and Costa Rica, burial of the placenta is believed to protect and ensure the health of the baby and the mother. If a mother dies in childbirth, the Aymara of Bolivia bury the placenta in a secret place so that the mother&#x27;s spirit will not return to claim her baby&#x27;s life.

The placenta is believed by some communities to have power over the lives of the baby or its parents. The Kwakiutl of British Columbia bury girls&#x27; placentas to give the girl skill in digging clams, and expose boys&#x27; placentas to ravens to encourage future prophetic visions. In Turkey, the proper disposal of the placenta and umbilical cord is believed to promote devoutness in the child later in life. In Transylvania and Japan, interaction with a disposed placenta is thought to influence the parents&#x27; future fertility.

Several cultures believe the placenta to be or have been alive, often a relative of the baby. Nepalese think of the placenta as a friend of the baby; the orang Asli and Malay populations in Malay Peninsula regard it as the baby&#x27;s older sibling. Native Hawaiians believe that the placenta is a part of the baby, and traditionally plant it with a tree that can then grow alongside the child. Various cultures in Indonesia, such as Javanese and Malay, believe that the placenta has a spirit and needs to be buried outside the family house. Some Malays would bury the baby&#x27;s placenta with a pencil (if it is a boy) or a needle and thread (if it is a girl).

In some cultures, the placenta is eaten, a practice known as human placentophagy. In some eastern cultures, such as China, the dried placenta (&quot;ziheche&quot; , literally &quot;purple river car&quot;) is thought to be a healthful restorative and is sometimes used in preparations of traditional Chinese medicine and various health products. The practice of human placentophagy has become a more recent trend in western cultures and is not without controversy; its practice being considered cannibalism is debated.

Some cultures have alternative uses for placenta that include the manufacturing of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food.

<text>Chymosin or rennin is a protease found in rennet. It is an aspartic endopeptidase belonging to MEROPS A1 family. It is produced by newborn ruminant animals in the lining of the abomasum to curdle the milk they ingest, allowing a longer residence in the bowels and better absorption. It is widely used in the production of cheese.

Historically, chymosin was obtained by extracting it from the stomachs of slaughtered calves. Today, most commercial chymosin used in cheese production is produced recombinantly in , &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; var. &quot;awamori&quot;, and .

==Occurrence==
Chymosin is found in a wide range of tetrapods, although it is best known to be produced by ruminant animals in the lining of the abomasum. Chymosin is produced by gastric chief cells in newborn mammals to curdle the milk they ingest, allowing a longer residence in the bowels and better absorption. Non-ruminant species that produce chymosin include pigs, cats, seals, and chicks.

One study reported finding a chymosin-like enzyme in some human infants, but others have failed to replicate this finding. Humans have a pseudogene for chymosin that does not generate a protein, found on chromosome 1. Humans have other proteins to digest milk, such as pepsin and lipase.

In addition to the primate lineage leading up to humans, some other mammals have also lost the chymosin gene.

==Enzymatic reaction==
Chymosin is used to bring about the extensive precipitation and curd formation in cheese-making. The native substrate of chymosin is K-casein which is specifically cleaved at the peptide bond between amino acid residues 105 and 106, phenylalanine and methionine. The resultant product is calcium phosphocaseinate. When the specific linkage between the hydrophobic (para-casein) and hydrophilic (acidic glycopeptide) groups of casein is broken, the hydrophobic groups unite and form a 3D network that traps the aqueous phase of the milk.

Charge interactions between histidines on the kappa-casein and glutamates and aspartates of chymosin initiate enzyme binding to the substrate. When chymosin is not binding substrate, a beta-hairpin, sometimes referred to as &quot;the flap,&quot; can hydrogen bond with the active site, therefore covering it and not allowing further binding of substrate.

==Examples==
Listed below are the ruminant &quot;Cym&quot; gene and corresponding human pseudogene:
==Recombinant chymosin==
Because of the imperfections and scarcity of microbial and animal rennets, producers sought replacements. With the development of genetic engineering, it became possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomach and insert them into certain bacteria, fungi or yeasts to make them produce chymosin during fermentation. The genetically modified microorganism is killed after fermentation and chymosin is isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the fermentation-produced chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers does not contain any GM component or ingredient. FPC contains the identical chymosin as the animal source, but produced in a more efficient way. FPC products have been on the market since 1990 and are considered the ideal milk-clotting enzyme.

FPC was the first artificially produced enzyme to be registered and allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration. In 1999, about 60% of US hard cheese was made with FPC and it has up to 80% of the global market share for rennet.

By 2008, approximately 80% to 90% of commercially made cheeses in the US and Britain were made using FPC. The most widely used fermentation-produced chymosin is produced either using the fungus &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; or using &quot;Kluyveromyces lactis&quot;.

FPC contains only chymosin B, achieving a higher degree of purity compared with animal rennet. FPC can deliver several benefits to the cheese producer compared with animal or microbial rennet, such as higher production yield, better curd texture and reduced bitterness.

<text>β-Galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23, beta-gal or β-gal; systematic name β--galactoside galactohydrolase) is a glycoside hydrolase enzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of terminal non-reducing β--galactose residues in β--galactosides. (This enzyme digests many β-Galactosides, not just lactose. It is sometimes loosely referred to as lactase but that name is generally reserved for mammalian digestive enzymes that breaks down lactose specifically.)

β-Galactosides include carbohydrates containing galactose where the glycosidic bond lies above the galactose molecule. Substrates of different β-galactosidases include ganglioside GM1, lactosylceramides, lactose, and various glycoproteins.

== Function ==
β-Galactosidase is an exoglycosidase which hydrolyzes the β-glycosidic bond formed between a galactose and its organic moiety. It may also cleave fucosides and arabinosides but at a much lower rate. It is an essential enzyme in the human body. Deficiencies in the protein can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome. In &quot;E. coli&quot;, the &quot;lacZ&quot; gene is the structural gene for β-galactosidase; which is present as part of the inducible system &quot;lac&quot; operon which is activated in the presence of lactose when glucose level is low. β-Galactosidase synthesis stops when glucose levels are sufficient.

β-Galactosidase has many homologues based on similar sequences. A few are evolved β-galactosidase (EBG), β-glucosidase, 6-phospho-β-galactosidase, β-mannosidase, and lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. Although they may be structurally similar, they all have different functions. Beta-gal is inhibited by -ribose and by competitive inhibitors 2-phenylethyl 1-thio-β--galactopyranoside (PETG), -galactonolactone, isopropyl thio-β--galactoside (IPTG), and galactose.

β-Galactosidase is important for organisms as it is a key provider in the production of energy and a source of carbons through the break down of lactose to galactose and glucose. It is also important for lactose-intolerant people as it is responsible for making lactose-free milk and other dairy products. Many adult humans lack the lactase enzyme, which has the same function as β-galactosidase, so they are not able to properly digest dairy products. β-Galactose is used in such dairy products as yogurt, sour cream, and some cheeses which are treated with the enzyme to break down any lactose before human consumption. In recent years, β-galactosidase has been researched as a potential treatment for lactose intolerance through gene replacement therapy where it could be placed into the human DNA so individuals can break down lactose on their own.

== Structure ==
The 1,023 amino acids of &quot;E. coli&quot; β-galactosidase were sequenced in 1983, and its structure determined eleven years later in 1994. The protein is a 464-kDa homotetramer with 2,2,2-point symmetry. Each unit of β-galactosidase consists of five domains; domain 1 is a jelly-roll type β-barrel, domain 2 and 4 are fibronectin type III-like barrels, domain 5 a novel β-sandwich, while the central domain 3 is a distorted TIM-type barrel, lacking the fifth helix with a distortion in the sixth strand.

The third domain contains the active site. The active site is made up of elements from two subunits of the tetramer, and disassociation of the tetramer into dimers removes critical elements of the active site. The amino-terminal sequence of β-galactosidase, the α-peptide involved in α-complementation, participates in a subunit interface. Its residues 22–31 help to stabilize a four-helix bundle which forms the major part of that interface, and residue 13 and 15 also contributing to the activating interface. These structural features provide a rationale for the phenomenon of α-complementation, where the deletion of the amino-terminal segment results in the formation of an inactive dimer.

==Reaction==
β-Galactosidase can catalyze three different reactions in organisms. In one, it can go through a process called transgalactosylation to make allolactose, creating a positive feedback loop for the production of β-galactose. Allolactose can also be cleaved to form monosaccharides. It can also hydrolyze lactose into galactose and glucose which will proceed into glycolysis. The active site of β-galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of its disaccharide substrate via &quot;shallow&quot; (nonproductive site) and &quot;deep&quot; (productive site) binding. Galactosides such as PETG and IPTG will bind in the shallow site when the enzyme is in &quot;open&quot; conformation while transition state analogs such as -ribose and -galactonolactone will bind in the deep site when the conformation is &quot;closed&quot;.

The enzymatic reaction consists of two chemical steps, galactosylation and degalactosylation. Galactosylation is the first chemical step in the reaction where Glu461 donates a proton to a glycosidic oxygen, resulting in galactose covalently bonding with Glu537. In the second step, degalactosylation, the covalent bond is broken when Glu461 accepts a proton, replacing the galactose with water. Two transition states occur in the deep site of the enzyme during the reaction, once after each step. When water participates in the reaction, galactose is formed, otherwise, when -glucose acts as the acceptor in the second step, transgalactosylation occurs . It has been kinetically measured that single tetramers of the protein catalyze reactions at a rate of 38,500 ± 900 reactions per minute. Monovalent potassium ions (K+) as well as divalent magnesium ions (Mg2+) are required for the enzyme&#x27;s optimal activity. The β-linkage of the substrate is cleaved by a terminal carboxyl group on the side chain of a glutamic acid.

In &quot;E. coli&quot;, Glu-461 was thought to be the nucleophile in the substitution reaction. However, it is now known that Glu-461 is an acid catalyst. Instead, Glu-537 is the actual nucleophile, binding to a galactosyl intermediate. In humans, the nucleophile of the hydrolysis reaction is Glu-268. Gly794 is important for β-galactosidase activity. It is responsible for putting the enzyme in a &quot;closed&quot;, ligand bounded, conformation or &quot;open&quot; conformation, acting like a &quot;hinge&quot; for the active site loop. The different conformations ensure that only preferential binding occurs in the active site. In the presence of a slow substrate, Gly794 activity increased as well as an increase in galactosylation and decrease in degalactosylation.

== Applications ==

The β-galactosidase assay is used frequently in genetics, molecular biology, and other life sciences. An active enzyme may be detected using artificial chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β--galactopyranoside, X-gal. β-galactosidase will cleave the glycosidic bond in X-gal and form galactose and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-hydroxyindole which dimerizes and oxidizes to 5,5&#x27;-dibromo-4,4&#x27;-dichloro-indigo, an intense blue product that is easy to identify and quantify. It is used for example in blue white screen. Its production may be induced by a non-hydrolyzable analog of allolactose, IPTG, which binds and releases the lac repressor from the lac operator, thereby allowing the initiation of transcription to proceed.

It is commonly used in molecular biology as a reporter marker to monitor gene expression. It also exhibits a phenomenon called α-complementation which forms the basis for the blue/white screening of recombinant clones. This enzyme can be split in two peptides, LacZα and LacZΩ, neither of which is active by itself but when both are present together, spontaneously reassemble into a functional enzyme. This property is exploited in many cloning vectors where the presence of the &quot;lacZα&quot; gene in a plasmid can complement in &quot;trans&quot; another mutant gene encoding the LacZΩ in specific laboratory strains of &quot;E. coli&quot;. However, when DNA fragments are inserted in the vector, the production of LacZα is disrupted, the cells therefore show no β-galactosidase activity. The presence or absence of an active β-galactosidase may be detected by X-gal, which produces a characteristic blue dye when cleaved by β-galactosidase, thereby providing an easy means of distinguishing the presence or absence of cloned product in a plasmid. In studies of leukaemia chromosomal translocations, Dobson and colleagues used a fusion protein of LacZ in mice, exploiting β-galactosidase&#x27;s tendency to oligomerise to suggest a potential role for oligomericity in MLL fusion protein function.

A recent study conducted in 2020–2021 determined that Beta-Galactosidase activity correlates with senescence of the cells. Senescence of the cells can be interpreted as cells that do not divide, but cells that do not die. Beta-Galactosidase activity can be overexpressed, and this can lead to various diseases afflicting a wide range of body systems. These systems include the cardiovascular system, skeletal system, and many more. Detecting senescence cells can be achieved by measuring the lysosomal Beta-Galactosidase activity.

A new isoform for beta-galactosidase with optimum activity at pH 6.0 (Senescence Associated beta-gal or SA-beta-gal) which is specifically expressed in senescence (the irreversible growth arrest of cells). Specific quantitative assays were even developed for its detection. However, it is now known that this is due to an overexpression and accumulation of the lysosomal endogenous beta-galactosidase, and its expression is not required for senescence. Nevertheless, it remains the most widely used biomarker for senescent and aging cells, because it is reliable and easy to detect.

== Evolution ==
Some species of bacteria, including &quot;E. coli&quot;, have additional β-galactosidase genes. A second gene, called evolved β-galactosidase (&quot;ebgA&quot;) gene was discovered when strains with the &quot;lacZ&quot; gene deleted (but still containing the gene for galactoside permease, &quot;lacY&quot;), were plated on medium containing lactose (or other 3-galactosides) as sole carbon source. After a time, certain colonies began to grow. However, the EbgA protein is an ineffective lactase and does not allow growth on lactose. Two classes of single point mutations dramatically improve the activity of ebg enzyme toward lactose. and, as a result, the mutant enzyme is able to replace the lacZ β-galactosidase. EbgA and LacZ are 50% identical on the DNA level and 33% identical on the amino acid level. The active ebg enzyme is an aggregate of ebgA -gene and ebgC-gene products in a 1:1 ratio with the active form of ebg enzymes being an &quot;α&quot;4 β4 hetero-octamer.

== Species distribution ==
Much of the work done on β-galactosidase is derived from &quot;E. coli.&quot; However the enzyme can be found in many plants (especially fruits), mammals, yeast, bacteria, and fungi. β-galactosidase genes can differ in the length of their coding sequence and the length of proteins formed by amino acids. This separates the β-galactosidases into four families: GHF-1, GHF-2, GHF-35, and GHF- 42. &quot;E. Coli&quot; belongs to GHF-2, all plants belong to GHF-35, and &quot;Thermus thermophilus&quot; belongs to GHF-42. Various fruits can express multiple β-galactosidase genes. There are at least seven β-galactosidase genes expressed in tomato fruit development, that have amino acid similarity between 33% and 79%. A study targeted at identifying fruit softening of peaches found 17 different gene expressions of β-galactosidases. The only other known crystal structure of β-galactosidase is from &quot;Thermus thermophilus.&quot;

<text>Placental mammals (infraclass Placentalia ) are one of the three extant subdivisions of the class Mammalia, the other two being Monotremata and Marsupialia. Placentalia contains the vast majority of extant mammals, which are partly distinguished from monotremes and marsupials in that the fetus is carried in the uterus of its mother to a relatively late stage of development. The name is something of a misnomer, considering that marsupials also nourish their fetuses via a placenta, though for a relatively briefer period, giving birth to less-developed young, which are then nurtured for a period inside the mother&#x27;s pouch. Placentalia represents the only living group within Eutheria, which contains all mammals that are more closely related to placentals than they are to marsupials.

== Anatomical features ==
Placental mammals are anatomically distinguished from other mammals by:
* a sufficiently wide opening at the bottom of the pelvis to allow the birth of a large baby relative to the size of the mother.
* the absence of epipubic bones extending forward from the pelvis, which are found in all other mammals. (Their function in non-placental mammals is to stiffen the body during locomotion, but in placentals they would inhibit the expansion of the abdomen during pregnancy.)
* the rearmost bones of the foot fit into a socket formed by the ends of the tibia and fibula, forming a complete mortise and tenon upper ankle joint.
* the presence of a malleolus at the bottom of the fibula.
* instead of a cloaca like monotremes, marsupials and most other vertebrates, the urogenital ducts exit through the vulva or penis and the rectum opens as the anus.
* the presence of a corpus callosum in between the cerebral hemispheres.

== Subdivisions ==
Analysis of molecular data led to rapid changes in assessments of the phylogeny of placental orders at the close of the 20th century. A novel phylogeny and classification of placental orders appeared with Waddell, Hasegawa and Okada in 1999. &quot;Jumping genes&quot;-type retroposon presence/absence patterns have provided corroboration of phylogenetic relationships inferred from molecular sequences. It is now widely accepted that there are three major subdivisions or lineages of placental mammals: Boreoeutheria, Xenarthra, and Afrotheria. All of these diverged from common ancestors.

2022 studies of Bertrand, O. C. and Sarah L. Shelley have identified palaeoryctids and taeniodonts as basal placental mammal clades.

The 19 living orders of Placentalia in the three groups are:

* Magnorder Atlantogenata
** Superorder Xenarthra
*** Order Cingulata (armadillos)
*** Order Pilosa (sloths and anteaters) 
** Superorder Afrotheria
*** Grandorder Afroinsectiphilia 
**** Order Tubulidentata (aardvarks)
**** Mirorder Afroinsectivora
***** Order Afrosoricida (tenrecs, otter shrews, and golden moles)
***** Order Macroscelidea (elephant shrews)
*** Grandorder Paenungulata 
**** Order Hyracoidea (hyraxes)
**** Mirorder Tethytheria
***** Order Proboscidea (elephants)
***** Order Sirenia (dugongs and manatees)
* Magnorder Boreoeutheria
** Superorder Euarchontoglires
*** Grandorder Gliriformes
**** Mirorder Glires 
***** Order Lagomorpha (rabbits, hares, and pikas) 
***** Order Rodentia (rodents: mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, chinchillas, capybaras, porcupines, voles, squirrels, beavers, etc.)
*** Grandorder Euarchonta 
**** Order Scandentia (treeshrews) 
**** Mirorder Primatomorpha 
***** Order Dermoptera (colugos) 
***** Order Primates (primates: monkeys, apes (including humans), lemurs, lorisids, galagos, and tarsiers) 
** Superorder Laurasiatheria
*** Order Eulipotyphla (hedgehogs, gymnures, shrews, moles, and solenodons)
*** Order Chiroptera (bats)
*** Grandorder Ferungulata
**** Mirorder Euungulata
***** Order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates: cattle, antelopes, sheep, deer, camelids, pigs, giraffes, cetaceans, hippopotamuses, goats, buffalo, etc.) 
***** Order Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates: horses, asses, zebras, rhinoceroses, and tapirs)
**** Mirorder Ferae
***** Order Pholidota (pangolins) 
***** Order Carnivora (carnivorans: dogs, cats, bears, pinnipeds, mongooses, raccoons, skunks, hyenas, weasels, etc.)

The exact relationships among these three lineages is currently a subject of debate, and four different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal or diverged first from other placentals. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra), Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria) and a hypothesis supporting a near simultaneous divergence. Estimates for the divergence times among these three placental groups mostly range from 105 to 120 million years ago (MYA), depending on the type of DNA, whether it is translated, and the phylogenetic method (e.g. nuclear or mitochondrial), and varying interpretations of paleogeographic data. In addition, a strict molecular clock does not hold, so it is necessary to assume models of how evolutionary rates change along lineages. These assumptions alone can make substantial differences to the relative ages of different mammal groups estimated with genomic data.

Cladogram and classification based on Amrine-Madsen, H. &quot;et al&quot;. (2003) and Asher, R. J. &quot;et al&quot;. (2009) Compare with Waddell, Hasegawa and Okada (1999) and Waddell et al. (2001).

== Genomics ==
, the genome has been sequenced for at least one species in each extant placental order and in 83% of families (105 of 127 extant placental families).

See list of sequenced animal genomes.

== Evolutionary history ==
True placental mammals (the crown group including all modern placentals) arose from stem-group members of the clade Eutheria, which had existed since at least the Middle Jurassic period, about 170 mya. These early eutherians were small, nocturnal insect eaters, with adaptations for life in trees.

True placentals may have originated in the Late Cretaceous around 90 mya, but the earliest undisputed fossils are from the early Paleocene, 66 mya, following the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The species &quot;Protungulatum donnae&quot; is sometimes placed as a stem-ungulate known 1 meter above the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary in the geological stratum that marks the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and &quot;Purgatorius&quot;, sometimes considered a stem-primate, appears no more than 300,000 years after the K-Pg boundary; both species, however, are sometimes placed outside the crown placental group, but many newer studies place them back in eutherians. The rapid appearance of placentals after the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous suggests that the group had already originated and undergone an initial diversification in the Late Cretaceous, as suggested by molecular clocks. The lineages leading to Xenarthra and Afrotheria probably originated around 90 mya, and Boreoeutheria underwent an initial diversification around 70-80 mya, producing the lineages that eventually would lead to modern primates, rodents, insectivores, artiodactyls, and carnivorans.

However, modern members of the placental orders originated in the Paleogene around 66 to 23 mya, following the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The evolution of crown orders such modern primates, rodents, and carnivores appears to be part of an adaptive radiation that took place as mammals quickly evolved to take advantage of ecological niches that were left open when most dinosaurs and other animals disappeared following the Chicxulub asteroid impact. As they occupied new niches, mammals rapidly increased in body size, and began to take over the large herbivore and large carnivore niches that had been left open by the decimation of the dinosaurs (and perhaps more relevantly competing synapsids). Mammals also exploited niches that the non-avian dinosaurs had never touched: for example, bats evolved flight and echolocation, allowing them to be highly effective nocturnal, aerial insectivores; and whales first occupied freshwater lakes and rivers and then moved into the oceans. Primates, meanwhile, acquired specialized grasping hands and feet which allowed them to grasp branches, and large eyes with keener vision which allowed them to forage in the dark.

The evolution of land placentals followed different pathways on different continents since they cannot easily cross large bodies of water. An exception is smaller placentals such as rodents and primates, who left Laurasia and colonized Africa and then South America via rafting.

In Africa, the Afrotheria underwent a major adaptive radiation, which led to elephants, elephant shrews, tenrecs, golden moles, aardvarks, and manatees. In South America a similar event occurred, with radiation of the Xenarthra, which led to modern sloths, anteaters, and armadillos, as well as the extinct ground sloths and glyptodonts. Expansion in Laurasia was dominated by Boreoeutheria, which includes primates and rodents, insectivores, carnivores, perissodactyls and artiodactyls. These groups expanded beyond a single continent when land bridges formed linking Africa to Eurasia and South America to North America.

A study on eutherian diversity suggests that placental diversity was constrained during the Paleocene, while multituberculate mammals diversified; afterwards, multituberculates decline and placentals explode in diversity.

<text>The World Trade Center site, often referred to as &quot;[[Ground zero#World Trade Center|Ground Zero]]&quot; or &quot;the Pile&quot; immediately after the September 11 attacks, is a 14.6-acre (5.9 ha) area in Lower Manhattan in New York City. The site is bounded by Vesey Street to the north, the West Side Highway to the west, Liberty Street to the south, and Church Street to the east. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) owns the site&#x27;s land (except for 7 World Trade Center). The original World Trade Center complex stood on the site until it was destroyed in the September 11 attacks.

The Port Authority, Silverstein Properties, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) have overseen the reconstruction of the site as part of the new World Trade Center, following a master plan by Studio Daniel Libeskind. Developer Larry Silverstein holds the lease to retail and office space in four of the site&#x27;s buildings.

==Before the World Trade Center==

The western portion of the World Trade Center site was originally under the Hudson River, with the shoreline in the vicinity of Greenwich Street. On this shoreline close to the intersection of Greenwich Street and the former Dey Street, Dutch explorer Adriaen Block&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Tyger&quot;, burned to the waterline in November 1613, stranding Block and his crew and forcing them to overwinter on the island. The remains of the ship were buried under landfill when the shoreline was extended starting in 1797, and were discovered during excavation work in 1916. The remains of another ship from the eighteenth century were found in 2010 during excavation work at the site. The ship, believed to be a Hudson River sloop, was found just south of where the Twin Towers used to stand, about below the surface.

The area that was cleared for construction of the original World Trade Center complex was previously occupied by various electronics stores in what was called Radio Row. These streets and stores were demolished in the 1960s to make way for the World Trade Center.

==Original buildings==
At the time of their completion the &quot;Twin Towers&quot;—the original 1 World Trade Center (the North Tower), at , and 2 World Trade Center (the South Tower)—were the tallest buildings in the world. The other buildings in the complex included the Marriott World Trade Center (3 WTC), 4 WTC, 5 WTC, 6 WTC, and 7 WTC. All of these buildings were built between 1972 and 1987, with a construction cost of $400 million (equivalent to $ in dollars). The complex was located in New York City&#x27;s Financial District and contained of office space.

The World Trade Center experienced a fire on , 1975, a bombing on , 1993 and a robbery on , 1998. In 1998, the Port Authority decided to privatize the World Trade Center, leasing the buildings to a private company to manage, and awarded the lease to Silverstein Properties on .

===September 11 attacks===
On the morning of September 11, 2001, Islamist terrorists affiliated with Al-Qaeda hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, both of which were en route from Boston to Los Angeles, and intentionally crashed them into the two main towers of the World Trade Center. The towers collapsed within less than two hours of the collisions. 2,606 people, including 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and in the surrounding area died in the attacks, as well as 147 civilians and the 10 hijackers aboard the two airliners. After the collapse of the World Trade Center, hospital workers and law enforcement officers began referring to the World Trade Center site as &quot;Ground Zero&quot;.

===Debris and clean-up===
The collapse of the towers spread dust across New York City and left hundreds of thousands of tons of debris at the site. To organize the cleanup and search for survivors and for human remains, the New York City Fire Department divided the disaster site into four sectors, each headed by its own chief. Cleanup workers trucked most of the building materials and debris from Ground Zero to Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island. Some people, such as those affiliated with World Trade Center Families for Proper Burial, were worried that human remains might also have been inadvertently transported to the landfill.

According to NIST, when WTC 1 (the North Tower) collapsed, falling debris struck 7 World Trade Center and ignited fires on multiple floors. The uncontrolled fires ultimately led to the progressive collapse of the structure.

Shortly after the attacks, the surrounding buildings were fitted with red mesh to prevent further damage. In November 2001, the remaining portions of Building 4 were leveled.

In December 2001, a temporary viewing platform at Fulton Street, between Church Street and Broadway, was opened to the public. That month, the last standing perimeter columns from the North Tower and the last remaining portions of Building 6 were removed. Early estimates suggested that debris removal would take a year, but cleanup ended in May 2002, under budget and without a single serious injury. The Winter Garden Atrium was reopened to the public on September 17, 2002, the first major structure to be completely restored following the attacks.

Starting March 11, 2002, eighty-eight searchlights were installed and arranged to form two beams of light shooting straight up into the sky. This was called the &quot;Tribute in Light&quot;, and was originally lit every day at dusk until April 14, 2002. After that, the lights were lit on the second anniversary of the attack and have been lit on each subsequent September 11 since then. In February 2005, the New York City Medical Examiner&#x27;s office ended its process of identifying human remains at the site.

In August 2008, New York City firefighters donated a cross made of steel from the World Trade Center to the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Company. The beam, mounted atop a platform shaped like the Pentagon, was erected outside the Shanksville firehouse near the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93.

Portions of the South Tower had also damaged the nearby Deutsche Bank Building, which soon became filled with toxic dust. By 2002, Deutsche Bank determined that its building was unsalvageable and it was scheduled for demolition. In January 2011, the demolition of the Deutsche Bank Building was completed.

===Archaeology===
In July 2010, a team of archaeologists at the site discovered the remains of a -long boat over 200 years old; it was probably made in the 18th century and dumped there along with wooden beams and trash in about 1810 to make up the land. The boat had been weighted to make it sink as part of foundations for a new pier. Samples of its wood have been taken for dendrochronology.

===Ownership status===
While the PANYNJ is often identified as the owner of the WTC site, the ownership situation was complicated after the September 11 attacks. The Port Authority did own a &quot;significant&quot; internal portion of the site of but has acknowledged &quot;ambiguities over ownership of miscellaneous strips of property at the World Trade Center site&quot; going back to the 1960s. It was unclear who owned of the site which is land where streets had been before the World Trade Center was built. In subsequent deals, the Port Authority gave some land to Larry Silverstein, including the land under 2 and 3 WTC in 2008.

==Planning for the new World Trade Center==
Soon after the September 11 attacks, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Governor George Pataki, and President George W. Bush vowed to rebuild the World Trade Center site. On the day of the attacks, Giuliani proclaimed, &quot;We will rebuild. We&#x27;re going to come out of this stronger than before, politically stronger, economically stronger. The skyline will be made whole again.&quot;

In a later address before Congress, the president declared, &quot;As a symbol of America&#x27;s resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City.&quot; The immediate response from World Trade Center leaseholder Larry Silverstein was that &quot;it would be the tragedy of tragedies not to rebuild this part of New York. It would give the terrorists the victory they seek.&quot; However, by 2011, only one building, 7 World Trade Center, had been rebuilt. The buildings that have been rebuilt as of June 2018 include 7 World Trade Center, One World Trade Center, 4 World Trade Center, and 3 World Trade Center. The original twin towers took less than three years from start of construction to be finished and five years from the beginning planning stages. However, given the complexity and highly political nature of the rebuilding efforts, they are often cited as an example of a successful public-private collaboration and are taught as a case study in successful negotiations.

===Early proposals for redesign===
====Lower Manhattan Development Corporation====
Governor Pataki established the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) in November 2001, as an official commission to oversee the rebuilding process. The LMDC coordinates federal assistance in the rebuilding process, and works with the PANYNJ, Larry Silverstein, and Studio Daniel Libeskind, the master plan architect for the site&#x27;s redesign. The corporation also handles communication with the local community, businesses, the city of New York, and relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks. A 16-member board of directors, half appointed by the governor and half by the mayor of New York, governs the LMDC.

The LMDC had questionable legal status regarding the restoration of the World Trade Center site, because the Port Authority owns most of the property and Larry Silverstein leased the World Trade Center&#x27;s office space in July 2001. But the LMDC, in an April 2002 articulation of its principles for action, asserted its role in revitalizing lower Manhattan.

====Directly after the attacks====

In the months following the attacks, architects and urban planning experts held meetings and forums to discuss ideas for rebuilding the site. In January 2002, New York City art dealer Max Protetch solicited 50 concepts and renderings from artists and architects, which were put on exhibit in his Chelsea art gallery.

In April 2002, the LMDC sent out requests for proposals to redesign the World Trade Center site to 24 Manhattan architecture firms, but then soon withdrew them. The following month, the LMDC selected Beyer Blinder Belle as planner for the redesign of the World Trade Center site.

On July 16, 2002, Beyer Blinder Belle unveiled six concepts for redesigning the World Trade Center site. All six designs were voted &quot;poor&quot; by the roughly 5,000 New Yorkers that submitted feedback, so the LDMC announced a new, international, open-design study.

====2002 World Trade Center site design competition====

In an August 2002 press release, the LMDC announced a design study for the World Trade Center site. The following month, the LMDC, along with New York New Visions – a coalition of 21 architecture, engineering, planning, landscape architecture and design organizations – announced seven semifinalists. The following seven architecture firms were then invited to compete to be the master plan architect for the World Trade Center:
* Foster and Partners (Norman Foster)
* Studio Daniel Libeskind (Daniel Libeskind)
* Meier Eisenman Gwathmey Holl (Peter Eisenman, Richard Meier, Charles Gwathmey and Steven Holl), known as &quot;The New York Five&quot;
* Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill
* THINK Team (Shigeru Ban, Frederic Schwartz, Ken Smith, Rafael Viñoly)
* United Architects
Peterson Littenberg, a small New York architecture firm, had been enlisted by the LMDC earlier that summer as a consultant, and was invited to participate as the seventh semifinalist.

The seven semifinalists presented their entries to the public on December 18, 2002, at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center. In the following weeks, Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill withdrew its entry from the competition.

Days before the announcement of the two finalists in February 2003, Larry Silverstein wrote to LMDC Chair John Whitehead to express his disapproval of all of the semifinalists&#x27; designs. As the Twin Towers&#x27; insurance money recipient, Silverstein claimed that he had the sole right to decide what would be built. He announced that he had already picked Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill as his master planner for the site.

On February 1, 2003, the LMDC selected two finalists, the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind, and planned on picking a single winner by the end of the month. Rafael Viñoly of the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind presented their designs to the LMDC, which selected the THINK design. Earlier the same day, however, Roland Betts, a member of the LMDC, had called a meeting and the corporation had agreed to vote for the THINK design before hearing the final presentations. Governor Pataki, who had originally commissioned the LMDC, intervened and overruled the LMDC&#x27;s decision. On February 27, 2003, Studio Daniel Libeskind officially won the competition to be the master planner for the World Trade Center redesign.

Libeskind&#x27;s original proposal, which is titled Memory Foundations, underwent extensive revisions during collaboration with Larry Silverstein, and Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, whom Silverstein hired. Though Libeskind designed the site, the individual buildings have been designed by different architects. While not all of Liebeskind&#x27;s ideas were incorporated into the final design, his design and the public support it garnered did solidify the principle that the original footprints of the Twin Towers should be turned into a memorial and not be used for commercial purposes. As a result, Liebeskind&#x27;s lawyers at the New York firm of Wachtell Lipton embarked on the multi-year negotiation process to frame a master plan for the rebuilding. The first step in this process, completed in 2003, was the &quot;swap&quot; in which Silverstein gave up his rights to the footprints of the Twin Towers so that they could become a memorial, and in exchange received the right to build five new office towers around the memorial. The &quot;swap&quot; and the ensuing negotiations, which lasted for many years, have been referred to as the most complex real estate transaction in human history because of the complexity of the issues involved, the many stakeholders, and the difficulty of reaching consensus.

===Criticism of progress===
An episode of CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 2010 focused on the lack of progress at Ground Zero, particularly on the lack of completion dates for a majority of the buildings, the main tower, One World Trade Center (previously known as the Freedom Tower)&#x27;s having undergone three different designs, and the delays and monetary expense involved. Investor Larry Silverstein said the Port Authority&#x27;s estimated completion date for the entire site was 2037, and billions of dollars had already been spent on the project, even though Ground Zero &quot;is still a hole in the ground&quot;. During an interview for the episode, Larry Silverstein said: &quot;I am the most frustrated person in the world...I&#x27;m seventy-eight years of age; I want to see this thing done in my lifetime&quot;. However, it was noted that in early 2011, all five office towers of the World Trade Center had begun construction.

The social center of the old World Trade Center included a spectacular restaurant on the 107th Floor, called Windows on the World, and its Greatest Bar in the World; these were tourist attractions in their own right, and a social gathering spot for people who worked in the towers. This restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the United States, called &quot;Windows on the World Wine School&quot;, run by wine personality Kevin Zraly. Despite numerous assurances that these local landmarks and global attractions would be rebuilt, the Port Authority scrapped plans to rebuild these WTC attractions, which has outraged some observers.

==New structures==

, the current structures on the site include:
===Towers===
One World Trade Center (previously coined the &quot;Freedom Tower&quot; by Governor Pataki) is the centerpiece of Libeskind&#x27;s design. The building rises to , the height of the original World Trade Center&#x27;s North Tower, and its antenna rises to the symbolic height of 1,776 feet (541 m). This height refers to 1776, the year in which the United States Declaration of Independence was signed. The tower was a collaboration between Studio Daniel Libeskind and Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill architect David Childs. Childs acted as the design architect and project manager for the tower, and Daniel Libeskind collaborated on the concept and schematic design. The design was finalized in 2004, but was revised extensively after the NYPD raised security concerns, which delayed the start of the construction by two years. In 2006, the Port Authority took over from Silverstein Properties. The project&#x27;s developer Tishman Construction Corporation was the construction manager at the time. Construction began in April 2006. Digging the foundation and installing tower-foundation steel columns, concrete, and rebar took twice as long as it normally would due to the existence of the subway line under West Broadway nearby. The building reached grade level by 2010, progressed at a pace of one floor a week, topped out in August 2012, and was structurally completed in May 2013. The building opened on November 3, 2014, and the first 170 employees of anchor tenant Conde Nast began their work there.

Danish architect Bjarke Ingels designed Two World Trade Center, also known as 200 Greenwich Street. The building&#x27;s gardens integrate Tribeca with the Financial District at the World Trade Center. As part of a 2010 lease deal to finance 4 WTC, there were plans to build 2 and 3 World Trade Center to ground level. Construction of everything up to street level was completed in mid-2013. The rest of the building, however, has yet to be built until tenants for Tower 2 can be found.

Richard Rogers Partnership designed Three World Trade Center, or 175 Greenwich Street, which stands across Greenwich Street from the Memorial&#x27;s two reflecting pools. Groundbreaking occurred in fall 2008, and in May 2009, the Port Authority proposed reducing the tower to four stories. In 2012, with Silverstein still unable to find tenants, construction on the above-ground levels was delayed indefinitely, with plans for only 7 stories. However, work progressed on below-grade foundations and the ground-level podium, which was completed by October 2013. Anchor tenant Group M was finally signed in late 2013, but finance negotiations between Silverstein Properties and the Port Authority dragged, until an agreement was reached in June 2014. Construction resumed in August 2014, and the building opened on June 11, 2018.

Maki and Associates designed Four World Trade Center, also known as 150 Greenwich Street. Construction started in 2008, and the steel skeleton was mostly complete by 2012. The building opened in November 2013, making it the second tower on the site to open behind 7 World Trade Center, as well as the first building on the Port Authority property. The first tenants to move in were two government agencies, and , the building is 62% leased.

Five World Trade Center was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and will stand where the Deutsche Bank Building once stood. On June 22, 2007, the Port Authority announced that JP Morgan Chase will lease the 42-story building for its investment banking headquarters; however, JPMorgan&#x27;s March 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns had caused construction to stagnate, as the company changed its plans and relocated its headquarters to 383 Madison Avenue. Construction began on September 9, 2011. Although the foundation was completed, construction on the main structure never commenced.

7 World Trade Center stands off of Port Authority property. David Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill designed the tower. Construction of the new Trade Center began in 2002 and the building opened on May 23, 2006, achieving LEED gold status and being the first tower in the complex to reopen. The building is tall (plus one underground floor), making it the 28th-tallest in New York.

===Memorial and museum===
Construction of the memorial was completed by early 2011. The memorial opened on September 11, 2011, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the attacks. The museum was initially scheduled to open on September 11, 2012, one year after the opening of the memorial. However, construction was halted in December 2011 due to financial disputes between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum Foundation, deciding on who should be responsible for infrastructure costs. Those disputes were resolved and construction resumed on September 10, 2012. Further delays were caused when Hurricane Sandy significantly damaged the site in November 2012. The museum was completed and opened to families of the victims on May 15, 2014 and opened to the general public on May 21, 2014.

===Retail space===

In early December 2013, Australian retail corporation Westfield announced that it will invest US$800 million for complete control of the retail space at the rebuilt center. Westfield purchased the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey&#x27;s 50 percent stake in the retail part of the World Trade Center site, increasing its total investment to more than US$1.4 billion.

===Transportation Hub===
A temporary PATH station opened in 2003 and construction on the permanent station was supposed to begin in fall 2004; however, the NYPD raised security concerns on the entire site. Among the revisions effecting the Transportation Hub was doubling the number of support columns. In the original plan, the construction of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum was only supposed to have begun after the Transportation Hub had been completed because the roof of the Transportation Hub provided the foundation on which the Memorial rested upon and the walls of the Museum. Due to the two-year delay and pressure by the victims&#x27; families to have the Memorial completed by the 10th anniversary, it was decided to concentrate on building the Memorial and holding off construction of the Transportation Hub, which increased costs. Construction finally began on the Transportation Hub in 2010. The hub formally opened on March 3, 2016, several years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.

=== Performing Arts Center ===
===Liberty Park and constituent structures===


===Fiterman Hall===


==Exclusive ZIP code==

The World Trade Center site used the ZIP code 10048 before the September 11 attacks, and there were eight letter carriers assigned to the buildings to deliver mail to the buildings&#x27; tenants. All of the Postal Service employees survived the attacks. In the months following the September 11, 2001 attacks, over 80,000 pieces of mail continued to arrive each day addressed to the World Trade Center, including some items loosely addressed to such recipients as &quot;The Search Dogs&quot; or &quot;The Rescuers&quot;. By 2003, 3,600 items of mail per day were still being sent to 10048. These items were processed at the James A. Farley General Post Office, the main facility for New York City, located across from Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan. Mail there was held for pick-up by messenger, forwarded to the intended recipient, returned to its sender, or destroyed.

Following the attacks, the United States Postal Service provided free mail-forwarding service to the WTC&#x27;s former occupants for three years, rather than the usual one-year period. By the end of 2006, the number of items sent to 10048 had decreased to around 300 items daily, mostly sent from businesses and organizations that had not yet updated their bulk mailing lists.

The 90 Church Street Station Post Office building is located adjacent to the new World Trade Center and the PATH station, and serves the ZIP code of 10007, which is assigned to the surrounding Tribeca neighborhood. The new World Trade Center does not use the ZIP code 10048; rather, it has been integrated within the existing 10007 ZIP code. The 10048 ZIP code was used again after the September 11, 2001 attacks for a pictorial cancellation commemorating the anniversary of the attacks.

<text>Phillip Walter Katz (November 3, 1962 – April 14, 2000) was a computer programmer best known as the co-creator of the ZIP file format for data compression, and the author of PKZIP, a program for creating zip files that ran under DOS. 

A copyright lawsuit between System Enhancement Associates (SEA) and Katz&#x27;s company, PKWARE, was widely publicized in the BBS community in the late 1980s. Katz&#x27;s software business was very successful, but he struggled with social isolation and chronic alcoholism in the last years of his life.

== Education and career ==
Phil Katz was a graduate of Nicolet High School in Glendale, Wisconsin. He graduated from the Computer Science Engineering program at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. After his graduation, he was hired by the Allen-Bradley company as a programmer. He wrote code to run programmable logic controllers, which operated manufacturing equipment on shop floors worldwide for Allen-Bradley&#x27;s customers.

=== PKARC and PKWARE ===
Katz left Allen-Bradley in 1986 to work for Graysoft, a Milwaukee-based software company. At the time, he had worked on an alternative to Thom Henderson&#x27;s ARC, named PKARC. ARC was written in C, with the source code available on System Enhancement Associates&#x27; bulletin board system (BBS). PKARC, written partially in assembly language, was much faster. Katz had a special flair for optimizing code: besides writing critical code in assembly language; he would write C code to perform the same task in several different ways and then examine the compiler output to see which produced the most efficient assembly code. He first publicly released only PKXARC, an extraction program, as freeware. Its much greater speed caused it to spread very quickly throughout the BBS community. Strong positive feedback and encouragement prompted Katz to release his compression program, PKARC, and eventually to make his software shareware. He founded PKWARE, Inc. (Phil Katz Software) in 1986, with the company&#x27;s operations located in his home in Glendale, Wisconsin, but he remained at Graysoft until 1987. Steve Burg, a former Graysoft programmer, joined PKWARE in 1988.

=== PKZIP ===

PKZIP made Katz one of the most well-known shareware authors of all time. Although PKWARE became a multimillion-dollar company, Katz was more noted for his technical expertise than business prowess. His family assisted him in running the company, but he eventually fired them when they denied him access to the company&#x27;s profits.

Katz was adamantly opposed to Microsoft Windows in the early 1990s. This led to PKWARE missing out on the opportunity to be the first to bring PKZIP to the platform, with WinZip becoming the standard tool on the platform instead.

==Lawsuits==
In the late 1980s, a dispute arose between System Enhancement Associates (SEA), maker of the ARC program, and PKWARE. SEA sued Katz for trademark and copyright infringement. The most substantial evidence at trial was from an independent software expert, John Navas, who was appointed by the court to compare the two programs. He stated that PKARC was a derivative work of ARC, pointing out that comments in both programs were often identical, including spelling errors.

On August 2, 1988, the plaintiff and defendants announced a settlement of the lawsuit, which included a confidential cross-license agreement. Under the agreement, SEA licensed PKWARE for all the ARC-compatible programs published by PKWARE during the period beginning with the first release of PKXARC in late 1985 through July 31, 1988, in return for an undisclosed payment. PKWARE agreed to pay SEA to obtain a license that allowed the distribution of PKWARE&#x27;s ARC-compatible programs until January 31, 1989, after which PKWARE would not license, publish or distribute any ARC compatible programs or utilities that process ARC compatible files. In exchange, PKWARE licensed SEA to use its source code for PKWARE&#x27;s ARC-compatible programs. PKWARE also agreed to cease any use of SEA&#x27;s trademark &quot;ARC&quot; and to change the names or marks used with PKWARE&#x27;s programs to non-confusing designations. The remaining details of the agreement were sealed. In reaching the settlement, the defendants did not admit any fault or wrongdoing. The Wisconsin court order showed the defendants were ordered to pay damages to the plaintiff for the defendants&#x27; acts. Namely, the defendants were found to be infringing the plaintiff&#x27;s copyrights, infringing trademark, as well as performing acts of unfair trade practices and unfair competition.

The leaked agreement document revealed that under the settlement terms, the defendants had paid the plaintiff $22,500 for past royalty payments and $40,000 for expense reimbursements. In addition, the defendants would pay the plaintiff a royalty fee of 6.5% of all revenue received for ARC compatible programs on all orders received after the effective date of the agreement. Such revenue would include any license fees or shareware registrations, received after the expiration of the license, for ARC compatible programs. In exchange, the plaintiff would also pay a commission in the amount of 6.5% of any license fees received by the plaintiff from any licensee referred to the plaintiff by the defendants, whether before or after the license termination date.

After the lawsuit, PKWARE released one last version of its PKARC and PKXARC utilities under the new names &quot;PKPAK&quot; and &quot;PKUNPAK&quot;, and from then on concentrated on developing the separate programs PKZIP and PKUNZIP, which were based on new and different file compression techniques. However, following the renaming, SEA filed a lawsuit against PKWARE for contempt, for continually using the plaintiff&#x27;s protected mark &quot;ARC&quot; by turning ARC from noun into verb in the PKPAK manual. The United States district court of the East District of Wisconsin ruled SEA&#x27;s motion was denied, and the defendant was entitled to recover the legal cost of $500.

The SEA vs. PKWARE dispute quickly expanded into one of the largest controversies the BBS world had ever seen. The suit by SEA angered many shareware users who perceived that SEA was a &quot;large, faceless corporation&quot; and Katz was &quot;the little guy&quot;. In fact, at the time, both SEA and PKWARE were small home-based companies. However, the community largely sided with Katz, because SEA was attempting to retroactively declare the ARC file format to be closed and proprietary. Katz received positive publicity by releasing the APPNOTE.TXT specification, documenting the Zip file format, and declaring that the Zip file format would always be free for competing software to implement. The net result was that the ARC format quickly dropped out of common use as the predominant compression format that bulletin board systems used for their file archives, and after a brief period of competing formats, the Zip format was adopted as the predominant standard.

== Alcoholism and death ==
Katz battled alcoholism for years. The earliest known arrest occurred in 1991. About a year later, Katz was again convicted of drunk driving. Between 1994 and September 1999, Katz was arrested five times for operating after suspension or revocation of his driver&#x27;s license.

Before his death, Ozaukee County Sheriff&#x27;s Department had several outstanding warrants against Katz, including jumping bail and the charges of operating an automobile while intoxicated and operating after revocation.

On April 14, 2000, at the age of 37, Katz was found dead in a hotel room with an empty bottle of peppermint schnapps in his hand. A coroner&#x27;s report stated his death was a result of acute pancreatic bleeding caused by chronic alcoholism.

<doc id="67193" wikidata="Q9384" url="?curid=67193" title="Testicle">
<text>A testicle or testis ( testes) is the gonad in all male bilaterians, including humans, and is homologous to the ovary in females. Its primary functions are the production of sperm and the secretion of androgens, primarily testosterone.

The release of testosterone is regulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. Sperm production is controlled by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland and by testosterone produced within the gonads.

==Structure==
===Appearance===
Males have two testicles of similar size contained within the scrotum, which is an extension of the abdominal wall. Scrotal asymmetry, in which one testicle extends farther down into the scrotum than the other, is common. This is because of the differences in the vasculature&#x27;s anatomy. For 85% of men, the right testis hangs lower than the left one. 

===Measurement and volume===
The volume of the testicle can be estimated by palpating it and comparing it to ellipsoids (an orchidometer) of known sizes. Another method is to use calipers, a ruler, or an ultrasound image to obtain the three measurements of the x, y, and z axes (length, depth and width). These measurements can then be used to calculate the volume, using the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid: 
:formula_1
:formula_2

However, the most accurate calculation of actual testicular volume is gained from the formula:

:formula_3

An average adult testicle measures up to . The Tanner scale, which is used to assess the maturity of the male genitalia, assigns a maturity stage to the calculated volume ranging from stage I, a volume of less than 1.5 cm3; to stage V, a volume greater than 20 cm3. Normal volume is 15 to 25 cm3; the average is 18 cm3 per testis (range 12–30 cm3).

The number of spermatozoa an adult human male produces is directly proportional to testicular volume, as larger testicles contain more seminiferous tubules and Sertoli cells as a result. As such, men with larger testicles produce on average more sperm cells in each ejaculate, as testicular volume is positively correlated with semen profiles.

===Internal structure===
====Duct system====
The testes are covered by a tough fibrous shell called the tunica albuginea. Under the tunica albuginea, the testes contain very fine-coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules. The tubules are lined with a layer of cells (germ cells) that develop from puberty through old age into sperm cells (also known as spermatozoa or male gametes). The developing sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the rete testis located in the mediastinum testis, to the efferent ducts, and then to the epididymis where newly created sperm cells mature (spermatogenesis). The sperm move into the vas deferens, and are eventually expelled through the urethra and out of the urethral orifice through muscular contractions.

====Primary cell types====
Within the seminiferous tubules, the germ cells develop into spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa through the process of spermatogenesis. The gametes contain DNA for fertilization of an ovum. Sertoli cellsthe true epithelium of the seminiferous epithelium, critical for the support of germ cell development into spermatozoa. Sertoli cells secrete inhibin. Peritubular myoid cells surround the seminiferous tubules.

Between tubules (interstitial cells) exist Leydig cellscells localized between seminiferous tubules that produce and secrete testosterone and other androgens important for puberty (including secondary sexual characteristics like facial hair), sexual behavior, and libido. Sertoli cells support spermatogenesis. Testosterone controls testicular volume.

Immature Leydig cells and interstitial macrophages and epithelial cells are also present.

====Blood supply and lymphatic drainage====
The testis has three sources of arterial blood supply: the testicular artery, the cremasteric artery, and the artery to the ductus deferens. Blood supply and lymphatic drainage of the testes and scrotum are distinct:
* The paired testicular arteries arise directly from the abdominal aorta and descend through the inguinal canal, while the scrotum and the rest of the external genitalia is supplied by the internal pudendal artery (a branch of the internal iliac artery).
* The testis has collateral blood supply from the cremasteric artery (a branch of the inferior epigastric artery, which is a branch of the external iliac artery), and the artery to the ductus deferens (a branch of the inferior vesical artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery). Therefore, if the testicular artery is ligated, e.g., during a Fowler-Stevens orchiopexy for a high undescended testis, the testis will usually survive on these other blood supplies.
* Lymphatic drainage of the testes follows the testicular arteries back to the paraaortic lymph nodes, while lymph from the scrotum drains to the inguinal lymph nodes.

====Layers====
Many anatomical features of the adult testis reflect its developmental origin in the abdomen. The layers of tissue enclosing each testicle are derived from the layers of the anterior abdominal wall. The cremasteric muscle arises from the internal oblique muscle.

====The blood–testis barrier====

Large molecules cannot pass from the blood into the lumen of a seminiferous tubule due to the presence of tight junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells. The spermatogonia occupy the basal compartment (deep to the level of the tight junctions) and the more mature forms, such as primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids, occupy the adluminal compartment.

The function of the blood–testis barrier may be to prevent an auto-immune reaction. Mature sperm (and their antigens) emerge significantly after immune tolerance is set in infancy. Since sperm are antigenically different from self-tissue, a male animal can react immunologically to his own sperm. The male can make antibodies against them.

Injection of sperm antigens causes inflammation of the testis (auto-immune orchitis) and reduced fertility. The blood–testis barrier may reduce the likelihood that sperm proteins will induce an immune response.

===Temperature regulation and responses===
Carl Richard Moore in 1926 proposed that testicles were external due to spermatogenesis being enhanced at temperatures slightly less than core body temperature outside the body. The spermatogenesis is less efficient at lower and higher temperatures than 33 °C. Because the testes are located outside the body, the smooth tissue of the scrotum can move them closer or further away from the body. The temperature of the testes is maintained at 34.4 °C, a little below body temperature, as temperatures above 36.7 °C impede spermatogenesis. There are a number of mechanisms to maintain the testes at the optimum temperature.

The cremasteric muscle covers the testicles and the spermatic cord. When this muscle contracts, the cord shortens and the testicles move closer up toward the body, which provides slightly more warmth to maintain optimal testicular temperature. When cooling is required, the cremasteric muscle relaxes and the testicles lower away from the warm body and are able to cool. Contraction also occurs in response to physical stress, such as blunt trauma; the testicles withdraw and the scrotum shrinks very close to the body in an effort to protect them.

The cremasteric reflex will reflexively raise the testicles. The testicles can also be lifted voluntarily using the pubococcygeus muscle, which partially activates related muscles.

===Gene and protein expression===
The human genome includes approximately 20,000 protein coding genes: 80% of these genes are expressed in adult testes. The testes have the highest fraction of tissue type-specific genes compared to other organs and tissues. About 1000 of them are highly specific for the testes, and about 2,200 show an elevated pattern of expression. A majority of these genes encode for proteins that are expressed in the seminiferous tubules and have functions related to spermatogenesis. Sperm cells express proteins that result in the development of flagella; these same proteins are expressed in the female in cells lining the fallopian tube and cause the development of cilia. Sperm cell flagella and fallopian tube cilia are homologous structures. The testis-specific proteins that show the highest level of expression are protamines.

==Development==

There are two phases in which the testes grow substantially. These are the embryonic and pubertal phases.
During mammalian development, the gonads are at first capable of becoming either ovaries or testes. In humans, starting at about week 4, the gonadal rudiments are present within the intermediate mesoderm adjacent to the developing kidneys. At about week 6, sex cords develop within the forming testes. These are made up of early Sertoli cells that surround and nurture the germ cells that migrate into the gonads shortly before sex determination begins. In males, the sex-specific gene SRY that is found on the Y chromosome initiates sex determination by downstream regulation of sex-determining factors (such as GATA4, SOX9 and AMH), which lead to development of the male phenotype, including directing development of the early bipotential gonad toward the male path of development. 

Testes follow the path of descent, from high in the posterior fetal abdomen to the inguinal ring and beyond to the inguinal canal and into the scrotum. In most cases (97% full-term, 70% preterm), both testes have descended by birth. In most other cases, only one testis fails to descend. This is called cryptorchidism. In most cases of cryptorchidism, the issue will mostly resolve itself within the first half year of life. However, if the testes do not descend far enough into the scrotum, surgical anchoring in the scrotum is required due to risks of infertility and testicular cancer. 

The testes grow in response to the start of spermatogenesis. Size depends on lytic function, sperm production (amount of spermatogenesis present in testis), interstitial fluid, and Sertoli cell fluid production. The testicles are fully descended before the male reaches puberty.

==Clinical significance==
===Protection and injury===

* The testicles are very sensitive to impact and injury. The pain involved travels up from each testicle into the abdominal cavity, via the spermatic plexus, which is the primary nerve of each testicle. This will cause pain in the hip and the back. The pain usually fades within a few minutes.
* Testicular torsion is a medical emergency. This is because the longer it takes to access medical intervention with respect to extending ischemia, the higher the chance that the testicle will be lost. There is a 90% chance to save the testicle if de-torsion surgery is performed within six hours of testicular torsion onset.
* Testicular rupture is severe trauma affecting the tunica albuginea.
* Penetrating injuries to the scrotum may cause castration, or physical separation or destruction of the testes, possibly along with part or all of the penis, which results in total sterility if the testicles are not reattached quickly. In an effort to avoid severe infection, ample application of saline and bacitracin help remove debris and foreign objects from the wound.
* Jockstraps support and protect the testicles.

===Diseases and conditions===

* To improve the chances of identifying cases of testicular cancer, neoplasms, and other health issues early, regular testicular self-examination is recommended.
* Varicocele, swollen vein(s) from the testes, usually affecting the left side, the testis usually being normal.
* Hydrocele testis is swelling around testes caused by accumulation of clear liquid within a membranous sac, the testis usually being normal. It is the most common cause of scrotal swelling.
* Spermatocele is a retention cyst of a tubule of the rete testis or the head of the epididymis distended with barely watery fluid that contains spermatozoa.
* Endocrine disorders can also affect the size and function of the testis.
* Certain inherited conditions involving mutations in key developmental genes also impair testicular descent, resulting in abdominal or inguinal testes, which remain nonfunctional and may become cancerous. Other genetic conditions can result in the loss of the Wolffian ducts and allow for the persistence of Müllerian ducts. Both excess and deficient levels of estrogens can disrupt spermatogenesis and cause infertility.
* Bell-clapper deformity is a deformity in which the testicle is not attached to the scrotal walls, and can rotate freely on the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis. Those with Bell-clapper are at a higher risk of testicular torsion.
* Orchitis is inflammation of the testicles
* Epididymitis is a painful inflammation of the epididymis or epididymides, frequently caused by bacterial infection but sometimes of unknown origin.
* Anorchia is the absence of one or both testicles.
* Cryptorchidism, or &quot;undescended testicles&quot;, is when the testicle does not descend into the scrotum of an infant boy.
*Testicular enlargement is an unspecific sign of various testicular diseases, and can be defined as a testicular size of more than 5 cm (long axis) × 3 cm (short axis).
*Blue balls is a condition concerning temporary fluid congestion in the testicles and prostate region, caused by prolonged sexual arousal.

Testicular prostheses are available to mimic the appearance and feel of one or both testicles, when absent as from injury or as treatment in association to gender dysphoria. There have also been some instances of their implantation in dogs.

Scientists are working on developing lab-grown testicles that might help infertile men in the future.

===Effects of exogenous hormones===
To some extent, it is possible to change testicular size. Short of direct injury or subjecting them to adverse conditions, e.g., higher temperature than they are normally accustomed to, they can be shrunk by competing against their intrinsic hormonal function through the use of externally administered steroidal hormones. Steroids taken for muscle enhancement (especially anabolic steroids) often have the undesired side effect of testicular shrinkage.

Stimulation of testicular functions via gonadotropic-like hormones may enlarge their size. Testes may shrink or atrophy during hormone replacement therapy or through chemical castration.

In all cases, the loss in testes volume corresponds with a loss of spermatogenesis.

==Society and culture==
The testicles of calves, lambs, roosters, turkeys, and other animals are eaten in many parts of the world, often under euphemistic culinary names. Testicles are a by-product of the castration of young animals raised for meat, so they might have been a late-spring seasonal specialty. In modern times, they are generally frozen and available year-round.

In the Middle Ages, men who wanted a boy sometimes had their left testicle removed. This was because people believed that the right testicle made &quot;boy&quot; sperm and the left made &quot;girl&quot; sperm. As early as 330 BC, Aristotle prescribed the ligation (tying off) of the left testicle in men wishing to have boys.

===Etymology and slang===
One theory about the etymology of the word &quot;testis&quot; is based on Roman law. The original Latin word , &quot;witness&quot;, was used in the firmly established legal principle &quot;&quot; (one witness [equals] no witness), meaning that testimony by any one person in court was to be disregarded unless corroborated by the testimony of at least another. This led to the common practice of producing two witnesses, bribed to testify the same way in cases of lawsuits with ulterior motives. Since such witnesses always came in pairs, the meaning was accordingly extended, often in the diminutive (&quot;testiculus, testiculi&quot;).

Another theory says that &quot;testis&quot; is influenced by a loan translation, from Greek &quot;defender (in law), supporter&quot; that is &quot;two glands side by side&quot;.

There are multiple slang terms for the testes. They may be referred to as &quot;balls&quot;. Frequently, &quot;nuts&quot; (sometimes intentionally misspelled as &quot;nutz&quot;) are also a slang term for the testes due to the geometric resemblance. One variant of the term includes &quot;Deez Nuts&quot;, which was used for a satirical political candidate in 2016. 

In Spanish, the term is used, which is Spanish for eggs.

==Other animals==

===External appearance===
In seasonal breeders, the weight of the testes often increases during the breeding season. The testicles of a dromedary camel are long, deep and in width. The right testicle is often smaller than the left.

In sharks, the testicle on the right side is usually larger. In many bird and mammal species, the left may be larger. Fish usually have two testes of a similar size. The primitive jawless fish have only a single testis, located in the midline of the body, although this forms from the fusion of paired structures in the embryo.

===Location===

====Internal====
The basal condition for mammals is to have internal testes. The testes of monotremes, xenarthrans, and afrotherians remain within the abdomen (testicondy). There are also some marsupials with external testes and boreoeutherian mammals with internal testes, such as the rhinoceros. Cetaceans such as whales and dolphins also have internal testes. As external testes would increase drag in the water, they have internal testes, which are kept cool by special circulatory systems that cool the arterial blood going to the testes by placing the arteries near veins bringing cooled venous blood from the skin. In odobenids and phocids, the location of the testes is para-abdominal, though otariids have scrotal testes.

====External====
Boreoeutherian land mammals, the large group of mammals that includes humans, have externalized testes. Their testes function best at temperatures lower than their core body temperature. Their testes are located outside of the body and are suspended by the spermatic cord within the scrotum.

There are several hypotheses as to why most boreotherian mammals have external testes that operate best at a temperature that is slightly less than the core body temperature. One view is that it is stuck with enzymes evolved in a colder temperature due to external testes evolving for different reasons. Another view is that the lower temperature of the testes simply is more efficient for sperm production.

The classic hypothesis is that cooler temperature of the testes allows for more efficient fertile spermatogenesis. There are no possible enzymes operating at normal core body temperature that are as efficient as the ones evolved.

Early mammals had lower body temperatures and thus their testes worked efficiently within their body. However, boreotherian mammals may have higher body temperatures than the other mammals and had to develop external testes to keep them cool. One argument is that mammals with internal testes, such as the monotremes, armadillos, sloths, elephants, and rhinoceroses, have a lower core body temperatures than those mammals with external testes.

Researchers have wondered why birds, despite having very high core body temperatures, have internal testes and did not evolve external testes. It was once theorized that birds used their air sacs to cool the testes internally, but later studies revealed that birds&#x27; testes are able to function at core body temperature.

Some mammals with seasonal breeding cycles keep their testes internal until the breeding season. After that, their testes descend and increase in size and become external.

The ancestor of the boreoeutherian mammals may have been a small mammal that required very large testes for sperm competition and thus had to place its testes outside the body. This might have led to enzymes involved in spermatogenesis, spermatogenic DNA polymerase beta and recombinase activities evolving a unique temperature optimum that is slightly less than core body temperature. When the boreoeutherian mammals diversified into forms that were larger or did not require intense sperm competition, they still produced enzymes that operated best at cooler temperatures and had to keep their testes outside the body. This position is made less parsimonious because the kangaroo, a non-boreoeutherian mammal, has external testicles. Separately from boreotherian mammals, the ancestors of kangaroos might have also been subject to heavy sperm competition and thus developed external testes; however, kangaroo external testes are suggestive of a possible adaptive function for external testes in large animals.

One argument for the evolution of external testes is that it protects the testes from abdominal cavity pressure changes caused by jumping and galloping.

Mild, transient scrotal heat stress causes DNA damage, reduced fertility and abnormal embryonic development in mice. DNA strand breaks were found in spermatocytes recovered from testicles subjected to 40 °C or 42 °C for 30 minutes. These findings suggest that the external location of the testicles provides the adaptive benefit of protecting spermatogenic cells from heat-induced DNA damage that could otherwise lead to infertility and germline mutation.

===Size===
The relative size of the testes is often influenced by mating systems. Testicular size as a proportion of body weight varies widely. In the mammalian kingdom, there is a tendency for testicular size to correspond with multiple mates (e.g., harems, polygamy). Production of testicular output sperm and spermatic fluid is also larger in polygamous animals, possibly a spermatogenic competition for survival. The testes of the right whale are likely to be the largest of any animal, each weighing around 500 kg (1,100 lb).

Among the Hominidae, gorillas have little female promiscuity and sperm competition and the testes are small compared to body weight (0.03%). Chimpanzees have high promiscuity and large testes compared to body weight (0.3%). Human testicular size falls between these extremes (0.08%).

Testis weight also varies in seasonal breeders like red foxes, golden jackals, and coyotes.

===Internal structure===
Amphibians and most fish do not possess seminiferous tubules. Instead, the sperm are produced in spherical structures called &quot;sperm ampullae&quot;. These are seasonal structures, releasing their contents during the breeding season, and then being reabsorbed by the body. Before the next breeding season, new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen. The ampullae are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in higher vertebrates, including the same range of cell types.

<text>Desegregation is the process of ending the separation of two groups, usually referring to races. Desegregation is typically measured by the index of dissimilarity, allowing researchers to determine whether desegregation efforts are having impact on the settlement patterns of various groups. This is most commonly used in reference to the United States. Desegregation was long a focus of the American civil rights movement, both before and after the US Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, particularly desegregation of the school systems and the military. Racial integration of society was a closely related goal.

==US military==
===Early history===
Starting with King Philip&#x27;s War in the 17th century, Black and White Americans served together in an integrated environment in the Thirteen Colonies. They continued to fight alongside each other in every American war until the War of 1812. Black people would not fight in integrated units again until the Korean War. Thousands of Black men fought in the new continental navy, on the side of rebellious colonists in the American revolutionary war. Their names, accomplishments and total numbers are unknown due to poor record keeping. 

During the American Civil War, Black people enlisted in large numbers. They were mostly enslaved African Americans who had escaped the South, though there were many Northern Black unionists as well. More than 180,000 Black people served with the Union army and navy during the civil war in segregated units, known as the United States Colored Troops, under the command of White officers. They were recorded and are part of the National Park Service&#x27;s Civil War Soldiers &amp; Sailors System (CWSS). Around 18,000 Black people also joined the Union Navy as sailors, who are also part of the CWSS.

===World Wars I and II===
Despite the NAACP lobbying for the commissioning of more Black officers, they were severely underrepresented throughout World War I. Upon entering office, President Woodrow Wilson officially segregated the United States navy for the first time in its history.

During World War II, most officers were White, and the majority of Black troops still served as truck drivers and as stevedores. The Red Ball Express, which was instrumental in facilitating the rapid advance of allied forces across France after D-Day, was operated almost exclusively by African American truck drivers. In the midst of the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was severely short of replacement troops for existing military units, all of which were entirely white in composition. Thus, he made the decision to allow African American soldiers to join White military units in combat for the first time; this represented the first step toward a desegregated United States military. Eisenhower&#x27;s decision in this case was strongly opposed by his own army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith, who was outraged by the decision, and said that the American public would take offense with the integration of the military units.

For the US Army air corps, see the Tuskegee Airmen.

For the US Army, see the 761st Tank Battalion (United States).

In the Second World War, the US Navy first experimented with integration aboard USCGC &quot;Sea Cloud&quot;, then later on , (both commanded by Carlton Skinner) a ship with Black crew members and commanded by White officers. Some called it &quot;Eleanor&#x27;s folly&quot; after President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s wife. &quot;Mason&quot;″s purpose had been to allow Black sailors to serve in the full range of billets (positions) rather than being restricted to stewards and mess men, as they were on most ships. The navy was pressured to train Black sailors for billets by Eleanor Roosevelt, who insisted that they be given the jobs for which they had trained.
The US Navy&#x27;s newest component, the Seabees, had the same ingrained attitudes and approaches but ended up at the forefront of change. In February 1942, the CNO, Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, recommended African Americans for ratings in the construction trades. In April, the navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, those men were put into segregated units, the 34th and 80th Naval Construction Battalions (NCBs). Both had White southern officers and Black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with this arrangement, which led to the replacement of the officers. In addition, many of the stevedore battalions (special construction battalions) were segregated. However, by war&#x27;s end, many of those special construction battalions were the first fully integrated units in the US navy. The war&#x27;s end also brought the decommissioning of every one of those units.

===Modern history===
On July 26, 1948, President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s Executive Order 9981 ordered the integration of the armed forces following World War II, a major advance in civil rights. Using the executive order meant that Truman could bypass Congress. Representatives of the Solid South, all White Democrats, would likely have stonewalled related legislation.

For instance, two months prior to Truman&#x27;s executive order in May 1948, Richard B. Russell, Democratic senator from Georgia, unsuccessfully attempted to attach a &quot;Freedom of Selection&quot; amendment granting draftees and new inductees the opportunity to choose whether or not they wanted to serve in segregated military units to the Selective Service Act that was being debated in Congress.

On 12 October 1972, a racially fraught riot occurred on . &quot;Despite the presence of a Black executive officer, the ship&#x27;s second-in-command, many Black sailors felt they were dealt harsher punishments and menial assignments because of their race&quot;.

==US housing==

The practice of housing segregation and racial discrimination has had a long history in the United States. Until the American civil rights movement in the 1960s, segregated neighborhoods were enforceable by law. The Fair Housing Act ended discrimination in the sale, rental and financing of housing based on race, color, religion, and national origin. This was the first housing law against discrimination. The passage of this act was contentious. It was meant to be a direct follow up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. However, from 1966 to 1967, it failed to garner enough political support for its passage in the United States Congress. At that time, several states had passed their own fair housing laws and Congress was not convinced that a federal law was necessary.

It was only after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on 4 April 1968 and the ensuing riots that the bill was finally passed. It was signed into law on 11 April 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, a strong proponent. Johnson called the new law one of the &quot;promises of a century … It proclaims that fair housing for all — all human beings who live in this country — is now a part of the American way of life.&quot; Since the act&#x27;s passage in 1968, it has been amended to include sex, familial status, and disability. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity within the US Department of Housing and Urban Development is charged with administering and enforcing this law.

==US education system==

After &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), the lawful segregation of African American children in schools became a violation of the 14th Amendment. In &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; (1971), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that forced busing of students may be ordered to achieve racial desegregation. However, court-enforced school desegregation efforts have decreased over time.

A major decline in manufacturing in northern cities, with a shift of jobs to suburbs, the South, and overseas, has led to increases in the numbers of residents of all races in suburbs, and shifts in population from the North and Great Plains to the southwest, the Pacific Northwest, and the South. Left behind in many northeastern and midwestern inner cities have been the poorest Black people and other minorities. According to Jonathan Kozol, in the early 21st century, US schools have become as segregated as they were in the late 1960s.

The Civil Rights Project at Harvard University says that desegregation of US public schools peaked in 1988. As of 2005, the proportion of Black students at schools with a White majority was at &quot;a level lower than in any year since 1968&quot;.

Some critics of school desegregation have argued that court-enforced desegregation efforts of the 1960s were either unnecessary or self-defeating, ultimately resulting in White flight from cities to suburbs. Middle class and wealthy White people continued moving from cities to suburbs during the 1970s and later, in part to escape certain integrated public school systems, but also as part of the suburbanization caused by movement of jobs to suburbs, continuing state and federal support for expansion of highways, and changes in the economy.

Some White parents in Louisiana said that they were afraid to drop off their children because of all the mobs surrounding the desegregated schools.

Sociologist David Armor states in his 1995 book &quot;Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law&quot; that efforts to change the racial compositions of schools had not contributed substantially to academic achievement by minorities. Carl L. Bankston and Stephen J. Caldas, in their books &quot;A Troubled Dream: The Promise and Failure of School Desegregation in Louisiana&quot; (2002) and &quot;Forced to Fail: The Paradox of School Desegregation&quot; (2005), argued that continuing racial inequality in the larger American society had undermined efforts to force schools to desegregate. They maintained that racial inequality had resulted in popular associations between school achievement and race. Therefore, the achievement levels of American schools were generally associated with their class and racial compositions. This meant that even parents without racial prejudice tended to seek middle class or better residential neighborhoods in seeking the best schools for their children. As a result, efforts to impose court-ordered desegregation often led to school districts with too few White students for effective desegregation, as White students increasingly left for majority White suburban districts or for private schools.

===Asian Americans===

The increasing diversity of American society has led to more complex issues related to school and ethnic proportion. In the 1994 federal court case &quot;Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District&quot;, parents of Chinese American schoolchildren alleged that racial quotas under a 1983 consent decree constituted racial discrimination in violation of the United States Constitution&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause. The desegregation plan did not allow any school to enroll more than 50% of any ethnic group. Originally intended to aid integration of Black students, the ruling had a negative effect on the admissions of Chinese Americans, who had become the district&#x27;s largest ethnic group.

The newspaper &quot;AsianWeek&quot; documented the Chinese American parents&#x27; challenge. Since Chinese Americans were already nearly half the student population, the consent decree had the effect of requiring the competitive Lowell High School in San Francisco, California, to apply much higher academic admission standards for Chinese American students. However, the civil rights group Chinese for Affirmative Action sided with the school district, arguing that such standards were not harmful to Chinese Americans, and were necessary to avoid the resegregation of schools. In 2006, Chinese parents continued to protest against race-based school assignments.

<text>Ophioglossum, the adder&#x27;s-tongue ferns, is a genus of about 50 species of ferns in the family Ophioglossaceae. The name &quot;Ophioglossum&quot; comes from the Greek meaning &quot;snake-tongue&quot;. Their cosmopolitan distribution is mainly in tropical and subtropical habitats.

The genus has the largest number of chromosomes in the known plant kingdom, but contrary to popular belief does not have the largest number of chromosomes out of all known organisms, falling short to the protist &quot;Sterkiella histriomuscorum&quot;.

==Description==
Adders-tongues are so-called because the spore-bearing stalk is thought to resemble a snake&#x27;s tongue. Each plant typically sends up a small, undivided leaf blade with netted venation, and the spore stalk forks from the leaf stalk, terminating in sporangia which are partially concealed within a structure with slit sides.

When the leaf blade is present, there is not always a spore stalk present, and the plants do not always send up a leaf, sometimes going for a year to a period of years living only under the soil, nourished by association with soil fungi.

The plant grows from a central, budding, fleshy structure with fleshy, radiating roots.

&quot;Ophioglossum malviae&quot; is known as the world&#x27;s smallest terrestrial fern.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Ophioglossum&quot; has a high chromosome count in comparison to other species, with 120 or up to 720 chromosomes possible in intervals of 120 due to polyploidy (multiple possible copies of chromosomes). It has almost 1260 number of chromosomes in the meiocyte (spore mother cell) which undergo meiosis, the reduction division to form the spore with only one set of chromosomes getting incorporated into each spore. The species &quot;Ophioglossum reticulatum&quot; has the highest number of chromosomes found in any multicellular organism.

<doc id="67211" wikidata="Q53859" url="?curid=67211" title="Electron configuration">
<text>In atomic physics and quantum chemistry, the electron configuration is the distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule (or other physical structure) in atomic or molecular orbitals. For example, the electron configuration of the neon atom is , meaning that the 1s, 2s, and 2p subshells are occupied by two, two, and six electrons, respectively.

Electronic configurations describe each electron as moving independently in an orbital, in an average field created by the nuclei and all the other electrons. Mathematically, configurations are described by Slater determinants or configuration state functions.

According to the laws of quantum mechanics, a level of energy is associated with each electron configuration. In certain conditions, electrons are able to move from one configuration to another by the emission or absorption of a quantum of energy, in the form of a photon.

Knowledge of the electron configuration of different atoms is useful in understanding the structure of the periodic table of elements, for describing the chemical bonds that hold atoms together, and in understanding the chemical formulas of compounds and the geometries of molecules. In bulk materials, this same idea helps explain the peculiar properties of lasers and semiconductors.

== Shells and subshells ==

Electron configuration was first conceived under the Bohr model of the atom, and it is still common to speak of shells and subshells despite the advances in understanding of the quantum-mechanical nature of electrons.

An electron shell is the set of allowed states that share the same principal quantum number, &quot;n&quot;, that electrons may occupy. In each term of an electron configuration, &quot;n&quot; is the positive integer that precedes each orbital letter (helium&#x27;s electron configuration is 1s2, therefore &quot;n&quot; = 1, and the orbital contains two electrons). An atom&#x27;s &quot;n&quot;th electron shell can accommodate 2&quot;n&quot;2 electrons. For example, the first shell can accommodate two electrons, the second shell eight electrons, the third shell eighteen, and so on. The factor of two arises because the number of allowed states doubles with each successive shell due to electron spin—each atomic orbital admits up to two otherwise identical electrons with opposite spin, one with a spin + (usually denoted by an up-arrow) and one with a spin of − (with a down-arrow).

A subshell is the set of states defined by a common azimuthal quantum number, , within a shell. The value of is in the range from 0 to &quot;n&quot; − 1. The values  = 0, 1, 2, 3 correspond to the s, p, d, and f labels, respectively. For example, the 3d subshell has &quot;n&quot; = 3 and  = 2. The maximum number of electrons that can be placed in a subshell is given by 2(2 + 1). This gives two electrons in an s subshell, six electrons in a p subshell, ten electrons in a d subshell and fourteen electrons in an f subshell.

The numbers of electrons that can occupy each shell and each subshell arise from the equations of quantum mechanics, in particular the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two electrons in the same atom can have the same values of the four quantum numbers.

Exhaustive technical details about the complete quantum mechanical theory of atomic spectra and structure can be found and studied in the basic book of Robert D. Cowan.

== Notation ==

Physicists and chemists use a standard notation to indicate the electron configurations of atoms and molecules. For atoms, the notation consists of a sequence of atomic subshell labels (e.g. for phosphorus the sequence 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p) with the number of electrons assigned to each subshell placed as a superscript. For example, hydrogen has one electron in the s-orbital of the first shell, so its configuration is written 1s1. Lithium has two electrons in the 1s-subshell and one in the (higher-energy) 2s-subshell, so its configuration is written 1s2 2s1 (pronounced &quot;one-s-two, two-s-one&quot;). Phosphorus (atomic number 15) is as follows: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p3.

For atoms with many electrons, this notation can become lengthy and so an abbreviated notation is used. The electron configuration can be visualized as the core electrons, equivalent to the noble gas of the preceding period, and the valence electrons: each element in a period differs only by the last few subshells. Phosphorus, for instance, is in the third period. It differs from the second-period neon, whose configuration is 1s2 2s2 2p6, only by the presence of a third shell. The portion of its configuration that is equivalent to neon is abbreviated as [Ne], allowing the configuration of phosphorus to be written as [Ne] 3s2 3p3 rather than writing out the details of the configuration of neon explicitly. This convention is useful as it is the electrons in the outermost shell that most determine the chemistry of the element.

For a given configuration, the order of writing the orbitals is not completely fixed since only the orbital occupancies have physical significance. For example, the electron configuration of the titanium ground state can be written as either [Ar] 4s2 3d2 or [Ar] 3d2 4s2. The first notation follows the order based on the Madelung rule for the configurations of neutral atoms; 4s is filled before 3d in the sequence Ar, K, Ca, Sc, Ti. The second notation groups all orbitals with the same value of &quot;n&quot; together, corresponding to the &quot;spectroscopic&quot; order of orbital energies that is the reverse of the order in which electrons are removed from a given atom to form positive ions; 3d is filled before 4s in the sequence Ti4+, Ti3+, Ti2+, Ti+, Ti.

The superscript 1 for a singly occupied subshell is not compulsory; for example aluminium may be written as either [Ne] 3s2 3p1 or [Ne] 3s2 3p. In atoms where a subshell is unoccupied despite higher subshells being occupied (as is the case in some ions, as well as certain neutral atoms shown to deviate from the Madelung rule), the empty subshell is either denoted with a superscript 0 or left out altogether. For example, neutral palladium may be written as either or simply , and the lanthanum(III) ion may be written as either or simply [Xe].

It is quite common to see the letters of the orbital labels (s, p, d, f) written in an italic or slanting typeface, although the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends a normal typeface (as used here). The choice of letters originates from a now-obsolete system of categorizing spectral lines as &quot;sharp&quot;, &quot;principal&quot;, &quot;diffuse&quot; and &quot;fundamental&quot; (or &quot;fine&quot;), based on their observed fine structure: their modern usage indicates orbitals with an azimuthal quantum number, , of 0, 1, 2 or 3 respectively. After f, the sequence continues alphabetically g, h, i... ( = 4, 5, 6...), skipping j, although orbitals of these types are rarely required.

The electron configurations of molecules are written in a similar way, except that molecular orbital labels are used instead of atomic orbital labels (see below).

== Energy of ground state and excited states ==
The energy associated to an electron is that of its orbital. The energy of a configuration is often approximated as the sum of the energy of each electron, neglecting the electron-electron interactions. The configuration that corresponds to the lowest electronic energy is called the ground state. Any other configuration is an excited state.

As an example, the ground state configuration of the sodium atom is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s1, as deduced from the Aufbau principle (see below). The first excited state is obtained by promoting a 3s electron to the 3p subshell, to obtain the
1s2 2s2 2p6 3p1 configuration, abbreviated as the 3p level. Atoms can move from one configuration to another by absorbing or emitting energy. In a sodium-vapor lamp for example, sodium atoms are excited to the 3p level by an electrical discharge, and return to the ground state by emitting yellow light of wavelength 589 nm.

Usually, the excitation of valence electrons (such as 3s for sodium) involves energies corresponding to photons of visible or ultraviolet light. The excitation of core electrons is possible, but requires much higher energies, generally corresponding to X-ray photons. This would be the case for example to excite a 2p electron of sodium to the 3s level and form the excited 1s2 2s2 2p5 3s2 configuration.

The remainder of this article deals only with the ground-state configuration, often referred to as &quot;the&quot; configuration of an atom or molecule.

== History ==
Irving Langmuir was the first to propose in his 1919 article &quot;The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules&quot; in which, building on Gilbert N. Lewis&#x27;s cubical atom theory and Walther Kossel&#x27;s chemical bonding theory, he outlined his &quot;concentric theory of atomic structure&quot;. Langmuir had developed his work on electron atomic structure from other chemists as is shown in the development of the History of the periodic table and the Octet rule.
Niels Bohr (1923) incorporated Langmuir&#x27;s model that the periodicity in the properties of the elements might be explained by the electronic structure of the atom. His proposals were based on the then current Bohr model of the atom, in which the electron shells were orbits at a fixed distance from the nucleus. Bohr&#x27;s original configurations would seem strange to a present-day chemist: sulfur was given as 2.4.4.6 instead of 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p4 (2.8.6). Bohr used 4 and 6 following Alfred Werner&#x27;s 1893 paper. In fact, the chemists accepted the concept of atoms long before the physicists. Langmuir began his paper referenced above by saying,«…The problem of the structure of atoms has been attacked mainly by physicists who have given little consideration to the chemical properties which must ultimately be explained by a theory of atomic structure. The vast store of knowledge of chemical properties and relationships, such as is summarized by the Periodic Table, should serve as a better foundation for a theory of atomic structure than the relatively meager experimental data along purely physical lines... These electrons arrange themselves in a series of concentric shells, the first shell containing two electrons, while all other shells tend to hold eight.…»The valence electrons in the atom were described by Richard Abegg in 1904.

In 1924, E. C. Stoner incorporated Sommerfeld&#x27;s third quantum number into the description of electron shells, and correctly predicted the shell structure of sulfur to be 2.8.6. However neither Bohr&#x27;s system nor Stoner&#x27;s could correctly describe the changes in atomic spectra in a magnetic field (the Zeeman effect).

Bohr was well aware of this shortcoming (and others), and had written to his friend Wolfgang Pauli in 1923 to ask for his help in saving quantum theory (the system now known as &quot;old quantum theory&quot;). Pauli hypothesized successfully that the Zeeman effect can be explained as depending only on the response of the outermost (i.e., valence) electrons of the atom. Pauli was able to reproduce Stoner&#x27;s shell structure, but with the correct structure of subshells, by his inclusion of a fourth quantum number and his exclusion principle (1925):

The Schrödinger equation, published in 1926, gave three of the four quantum numbers as a direct consequence of its solution for the hydrogen atom: this solution yields the atomic orbitals that are shown today in textbooks of chemistry (and above). The examination of atomic spectra allowed the electron configurations of atoms to be determined experimentally, and led to an empirical rule (known as Madelung&#x27;s rule (1936), see below) for the order in which atomic orbitals are filled with electrons.

== Atoms: Aufbau principle and Madelung rule ==
The aufbau principle (from the German &quot;Aufbau&quot;, &quot;building up, construction&quot;) was an important part of Bohr&#x27;s original concept of electron configuration. It may be stated as:
:&quot;a maximum of two electrons are put into orbitals in the order of increasing orbital energy: the lowest-energy subshells are filled before electrons are placed in higher-energy orbitals.&quot;

The principle works very well (for the ground states of the atoms) for the known 118 elements, although it is sometimes slightly wrong. The modern form of the aufbau principle describes an order of orbital energies given by Madelung&#x27;s rule (or Klechkowski&#x27;s rule). This rule was first stated by Charles Janet in 1929, rediscovered by Erwin Madelung in 1936, and later given a theoretical justification by V. M. Klechkowski:
# Subshells are filled in the order of increasing &quot;n&quot; + .
# Where two subshells have the same value of &quot;n&quot; + , they are filled in order of increasing &quot;n&quot;.
This gives the following order for filling the orbitals:
:1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p, (8s, , 6f, 7d, 8p, and 9s)

In this list the subshells in parentheses are not occupied in the ground state of the heaviest atom now known (Og, &quot;Z&quot; = 118).

The aufbau principle can be applied, in a modified form, to the protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus, as in the shell model of nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry.

=== Periodic table ===
The form of the periodic table is closely related to the atomic electron configuration for each element. For example, all the elements of group 2 (the table&#x27;s second column) have an electron configuration of [E] &quot;n&quot;s (where [E] is a noble gas configuration), and have notable similarities in their chemical properties. The periodicity of the periodic table in terms of periodic table blocks is due to the number of electrons (2, 6, 10, and 14) needed to fill s, p, d, and f subshells. These blocks appear as the rectangular sections of the periodic table. The single exception is helium, which despite being an s-block atom is conventionally placed with the other noble gasses in the p-block due to its chemical inertness, a consequence of its full outer shell (though there is discussion in the contemporary literature on whether this exception should be retained).

The electrons in the valence (outermost) shell largely determine each element&#x27;s chemical properties. The similarities in the chemical properties were remarked on more than a century before the idea of electron configuration.

=== Shortcomings of the aufbau principle ===
The aufbau principle rests on a fundamental postulate that the order of orbital energies is fixed, both for a given element and between different elements; in both cases this is only approximately true. It considers atomic orbitals as &quot;boxes&quot; of fixed energy into which can be placed two electrons and no more. However, the energy of an electron &quot;in&quot; an atomic orbital depends on the energies of all the other electrons of the atom (or ion, or molecule, etc.). There are no &quot;one-electron solutions&quot; for systems of more than one electron, only a set of many-electron solutions that cannot be calculated exactly (although there are mathematical approximations available, such as the Hartree–Fock method).

The fact that the aufbau principle is based on an approximation can be seen from the fact that there is an almost-fixed filling order at all, that, within a given shell, the s-orbital is always filled before the p-orbitals. In a hydrogen-like atom, which only has one electron, the s-orbital and the p-orbitals of the same shell have exactly the same energy, to a very good approximation in the absence of external electromagnetic fields. (However, in a real hydrogen atom, the energy levels are slightly split by the magnetic field of the nucleus, and by the quantum electrodynamic effects of the Lamb shift.)

=== Ionization of the transition metals ===
The naïve application of the aufbau principle leads to a well-known paradox (or apparent paradox) in the basic chemistry of the transition metals. Potassium and calcium appear in the periodic table before the transition metals, and have electron configurations [Ar] 4s and [Ar] 4s respectively, i.e. the 4s-orbital is filled before the 3d-orbital. This is in line with Madelung&#x27;s rule, as the 4s-orbital has &quot;n&quot; +  = 4 (&quot;n&quot; = 4,  = 0) while the 3d-orbital has &quot;n&quot; +  = 5 (&quot;n&quot; = 3,  = 2). After calcium, most neutral atoms in the first series of transition metals (scandium through zinc) have configurations with two 4s electrons, but there are two exceptions. Chromium and copper have electron configurations [Ar] 3d 4s and [Ar] 3d 4s respectively, i.e. one electron has passed from the 4s-orbital to a 3d-orbital to generate a half-filled or filled subshell. In this case, the usual explanation is that &quot;half-filled or completely filled subshells are particularly stable arrangements of electrons&quot;. However, this is not supported by the facts, as tungsten (W) has a Madelung-following d s configuration and not d s, and niobium (Nb) has an anomalous d s configuration that does not give it a half-filled or completely filled subshell.

The apparent paradox arises when electrons are &quot;removed&quot; from the transition metal atoms to form ions. The first electrons to be ionized come not from the 3d-orbital, as one would expect if it were &quot;higher in energy&quot;, but from the 4s-orbital. This interchange of electrons between 4s and 3d is found for all atoms of the first series of transition metals. The configurations of the neutral atoms (K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, ...) usually follow the order 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, ...; however the successive stages of ionization of a given atom (such as Fe4+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Fe+, Fe) usually follow the order 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, ...

This phenomenon is only paradoxical if it is assumed that the energy order of atomic orbitals is fixed and unaffected by the nuclear charge or by the presence of electrons in other orbitals. If that were the case, the 3d-orbital would have the same energy as the 3p-orbital, as it does in hydrogen, yet it clearly does not. There is no special reason why the Fe ion should have the same electron configuration as the chromium atom, given that iron has two more protons in its nucleus than chromium, and that the chemistry of the two species is very different. Melrose and Eric Scerri have analyzed the changes of orbital energy with orbital occupations in terms of the two-electron repulsion integrals of the Hartree–Fock method of atomic structure calculation. More recently Scerri has argued that contrary to what is stated in the vast majority of sources including the title of his previous article on the subject, 3d orbitals rather than 4s are in fact preferentially occupied.

In chemical environments, configurations can change even more: Th3+ as a bare ion has a configuration of [Rn] 5f1, yet in most ThIII compounds the thorium atom has a 6d1 configuration instead. Mostly, what is present is rather a superposition of various configurations. For instance, copper metal is poorly described by either an [Ar] 3d 4s or an [Ar] 3d 4s configuration, but is rather well described as a 90% contribution of the first and a 10% contribution of the second. Indeed, visible light is already enough to excite electrons in most transition metals, and they often continuously &quot;flow&quot; through different configurations when that happens (copper and its group are an exception).

Similar ion-like 3d 4s configurations occur in transition metal complexes as described by the simple crystal field theory, even if the metal has oxidation state 0. For example, chromium hexacarbonyl can be described as a chromium atom (not ion) surrounded by six carbon monoxide ligands. The electron configuration of the central chromium atom is described as 3d with the six electrons filling the three lower-energy d orbitals between the ligands. The other two d orbitals are at higher energy due to the crystal field of the ligands. This picture is consistent with the experimental fact that the complex is diamagnetic, meaning that it has no unpaired electrons. However, in a more accurate description using molecular orbital theory, the d-like orbitals occupied by the six electrons are no longer identical with the d orbitals of the free atom.

=== Other exceptions to Madelung&#x27;s rule ===
There are several more exceptions to Madelung&#x27;s rule among the heavier elements, and as atomic number increases it becomes more and more difficult to find simple explanations such as the stability of half-filled subshells. It is possible to predict most of the exceptions by Hartree–Fock calculations, which are an approximate method for taking account of the effect of the other electrons on orbital energies. Qualitatively, for example, the 4d elements have the greatest concentration of Madelung anomalies, because the 4d–5s gap is larger than the 3d–4s and 5d–6s gaps.

For the heavier elements, it is also necessary to take account of the effects of special relativity on the energies of the atomic orbitals, as the inner-shell electrons are moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. In general, these relativistic effects tend to decrease the energy of the s-orbitals in relation to the other atomic orbitals. This is the reason why the 6d elements are predicted to have no Madelung anomalies apart from lawrencium (for which relativistic effects stabilise the p1/2 orbital as well and cause its occupancy in the ground state), as relativity intervenes to make the 7s orbitals lower in energy than the 6d ones.

The table below shows the configurations of the f-block (green) and d-block (blue) atoms. It shows the ground state configuration in terms of orbital occupancy, but it does not show the ground state in terms of the sequence of orbital energies as determined spectroscopically. For example, in the transition metals, the 4s orbital is of a higher energy than the 3d orbitals; and in the lanthanides, the 6s is higher than the 4f and 5d. The ground states can be seen in the Electron configurations of the elements (data page). However this also depends on the charge: a calcium atom has 4s lower in energy than 3d, but a Ca2+ cation has 3d lower in energy than 4s. In practice the configurations predicted by the Madelung rule are at least close to the ground state even in these anomalous cases. The empty f orbitals in lanthanum, actinium, and thorium contribute to chemical bonding, as do the empty p orbitals in transition metals.

Vacant s, d, and f orbitals have been shown explicitly, as is occasionally done, to emphasise the filling order and to clarify that even orbitals unoccupied in the ground state (e.g. lanthanum 4f or palladium 5s) may be occupied and bonding in chemical compounds. (The same is also true for the p-orbitals, which are not explicitly shown because they are only actually occupied for lawrencium in gas-phase ground states.)
The various anomalies describe the free atoms and do not necessarily predict chemical behavior. Thus for example neodymium typically forms the +3 oxidation state, despite its configuration that if interpreted naïvely would suggest a more stable +2 oxidation state corresponding to losing only the 6s electrons. Contrariwise, uranium as is not very stable in the +3 oxidation state either, preferring +4 and +6.

The electron-shell configuration of elements beyond hassium has not yet been empirically verified, but they are expected to follow Madelung&#x27;s rule without exceptions until element 120. Element 121 should have the anomalous configuration , having a p rather than a g electron. Electron configurations beyond this are tentative and predictions differ between models, but Madelung&#x27;s rule is expected to break down due to the closeness in energy of the , 6f, 7d, and 8p1/2 orbitals. That said, the filling sequence 8s, , 6f, 7d, 8p is predicted to hold approximately, with perturbations due to the huge spin-orbit splitting of the 8p and 9p shells, and the huge relativistic stabilisation of the 9s shell.

== Open and closed shells ==

In the context of atomic orbitals, an open shell is a valence shell which is not completely filled with electrons or that has not given all of its valence electrons through chemical bonds with other atoms or molecules during a chemical reaction. Conversely a closed shell is obtained with a completely filled valence shell. This configuration is very stable.

For molecules, &quot;open shell&quot; signifies that there are unpaired electrons. In molecular orbital theory, this leads to molecular orbitals that are singly occupied. In computational chemistry implementations of molecular orbital theory, open-shell molecules have to be handled by either the restricted open-shell Hartree–Fock method or the unrestricted Hartree–Fock method. Conversely a closed-shell configuration corresponds to a state where all molecular orbitals are either doubly occupied or empty (a singlet state). Open shell molecules are more difficult to study computationally.

== Noble gas configuration ==

Noble gas configuration is the electron configuration of noble gases. The basis of all chemical reactions is the tendency of chemical elements to acquire stability. Main-group atoms generally obey the octet rule, while transition metals generally obey the 18-electron rule. The noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn) are less reactive than other elements because they already have a noble gas configuration. Oganesson is predicted to be more reactive due to relativistic effects for heavy atoms.

Every system has the tendency to acquire the state of stability or a state of minimum energy, and so chemical elements take part in chemical reactions to acquire a stable electronic configuration similar to that of its nearest noble gas. An example of this tendency is two hydrogen (H) atoms reacting with one oxygen (O) atom to form water (H2O). Neutral atomic hydrogen has one electron in its valence shell, and on formation of water it acquires a share of a second electron coming from oxygen, so that its configuration is similar to that of its nearest noble gas helium (He) with two electrons in its valence shell. Similarly, neutral atomic oxygen has six electrons in its valence shell, and acquires a share of two electrons from the two hydrogen atoms, so that its configuration is similar to that of its nearest noble gas neon with eight electrons in its valence shell.

== Electron configuration in molecules ==
Electron configuration in molecules is more complex than the electron configuration of atoms, as each molecule has a different orbital structure. The molecular orbitals are labelled according to their symmetry, rather than the atomic orbital labels used for atoms and monatomic ions; hence, the electron configuration of the dioxygen molecule, O, is written 1σ 1σ 2σ 2σ 3σ 1π 1π, or equivalently 1σ 1σ 2σ 2σ 1π 3σ 1π. The term 1π represents the two electrons in the two degenerate π*-orbitals (antibonding). From Hund&#x27;s rules, these electrons have parallel spins in the ground state, and so dioxygen has a net magnetic moment (it is paramagnetic). The explanation of the paramagnetism of dioxygen was a major success for molecular orbital theory.

The electronic configuration of polyatomic molecules can change without absorption or emission of a photon through vibronic couplings.

=== Electron configuration in solids ===
In a solid, the electron states become very numerous. They cease to be discrete, and effectively blend into continuous ranges of possible states (an electron band). The notion of electron configuration ceases to be relevant, and yields to band theory.

== Applications ==
The most widespread application of electron configurations is in the rationalization of chemical properties, in both inorganic and organic chemistry. In effect, electron configurations, along with some simplified forms of molecular orbital theory, have become the modern equivalent of the valence concept, describing the number and type of chemical bonds that an atom can be expected to form.

This approach is taken further in computational chemistry, which typically attempts to make quantitative estimates of chemical properties. For many years, most such calculations relied upon the &quot;linear combination of atomic orbitals&quot; (LCAO) approximation, using an ever-larger and more complex basis set of atomic orbitals as the starting point. The last step in such a calculation is the assignment of electrons among the molecular orbitals according to the aufbau principle. Not all methods in computational chemistry rely on electron configuration: density functional theory (DFT) is an important example of a method that discards the model.

For atoms or molecules with more than one electron, the motion of electrons are correlated and such a picture is no longer exact. A very large number of electronic configurations are needed to exactly describe any multi-electron system, and no energy can be associated with one single configuration. However, the electronic wave function is usually dominated by a very small number of configurations and therefore the notion of electronic configuration remains essential for multi-electron systems.

A fundamental application of electron configurations is in the interpretation of atomic spectra. In this case, it is necessary to supplement the electron configuration with one or more term symbols, which describe the different energy levels available to an atom. Term symbols can be calculated for any electron configuration, not just the ground-state configuration listed in tables, although not all the energy levels are observed in practice. It is through the analysis of atomic spectra that the ground-state electron configurations of the elements were experimentally determined.

<doc id="67212" wikidata="Q53446" url="?curid=67212" title="Henry II the Pious">
<text>Henry II the Pious (; 1196 – 9 April 1241) was Duke of Silesia and High Duke of Poland as well as Duke of South-Greater Poland from 1238 until his death. Between 1238 and 1239 he also served as regent of Sandomierz and Opole–Racibórz. He was the son of Henry the Bearded and a member of the Silesian Piast dynasty. In October 2015, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Legnica opened up his cause for beatification, obtaining him the title of Servant of God.

==Early life==
Henry the Pious was the second son of High Duke Henry the Bearded of Poland and Hedwig of Andechs. His elder brother, Bolesław, died in 1206. In 1213, his younger brother Konrad the Curly died during a hunt, leaving the young Henry as the sole heir of Lower Silesia. Around 1218 his father arranged his marriage to Anne, daughter of King Ottokar I of Bohemia. This union with the royal Přemyslid dynasty allowed Henry the Pious to participate actively in international politics.

Henry the Bearded quickly designated his sole surviving son as his sole heir, and from 1222, the young prince countersigned documents with his father. By 1224, he had his own seal and notary. In 1227, during a meeting of Piast dukes in Gąsawa, Henry the Bearded and High Duke Leszek I the White were ambushed. Leszek was killed and Henry was seriously wounded. Henry the Pious acted as interim duke. In 1229, Henry the Bearded was captured by Duke Konrad I of Masovia, and again young Henry the Pious acted as interim duke. During 1229–30, he led a military expedition to recover and secure the possession of Lubusz Land, and in 1233–34 he actively supported his father&#x27;s affairs in Prussia and Greater Poland. In 1234, Henry the Bearded named his son co-ruler. Later, Henry the Bearded took the duchies of Kraków and Silesia, and Henry the Pious was given the duchies of Silesia and Greater Poland. When Henry the Bearded died on 19 March 1238, Henry the Pious became duke of Silesia, Kraków and Greater Poland.

==Sole reign==
Henry the Pious inherited Lower Silesia from his father. Southern Greater Poland and Kraków were ruled by the Piast princes, although the late duke of Greater Poland and Kraków, Władysław III, had left all his lands to Henry the Bearded. The will was ignored by Duke Konrad of Masovia and Władysław&#x27;s III nephew Władysław Odonic.

Henry II could retain his authority as a regent over the Upper Silesian Duchy of Opole-Racibórz and the Duchy of Sandomierz during the minority of their rulers Mieszko II the Fat and Bolesław V the Chaste. Nevertheless, in 1239, Henry was compelled to resign the regency, although he remained on good terms with the Dukes of Opole and Sandomierz, and managed to retain Greater Polish Kalisz and Wieluń.

The situation in the northwest was more complicated: Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg took the important Greater Polish fortress at Santok and besieged Lubusz. Henry II also inherited the disputes with Konrad of Masovia, Władysław Odonic, and with the Church, led by Pełka, Archbishop of Gniezno. The situation changed unexpectedly after the death of Władysław Odonic on 5 June 1239, who left two minor sons, Przemysł I and Bolesław the Pious. Henry II took the majority of Odonic&#x27;s possessions (including Gniezno), leaving Nakło nad Notecią and Ujście to Odonic&#x27;s sons.

Henry then abandoned the traditional alliance of his family with the Imperial House of Hohenstaufen and supported Pope Gregory IX, immediately resolving his dispute with the Church. He then put an end to his conflicts with Konrad of Masovia by arranging the marriages of two of his daughters to two of Konrad&#x27;s sons: Gertrude to Bolesław, and Constance, to Casimir I of Kuyavia. In 1239, Henry II reclaimed the Santok fortress from Margrave Otto III after Henry&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Lubusz.

==Mongol invasion==

In the East, a new dangerous opponent appeared: the Mongols, under the leadership of Batu Khan, who, after the invasion of Rus&#x27; chose the Kingdom of Hungary as his next target. Batu Khan realized that he had to take control of Poland before he could take Hungary. In January 1241, Batu sent reconnaissance troops to Lublin and Zawichost. The invasion was launched a month later, by an army of 10,000 men under the leadership of Orda. In Lesser Poland the Mongols met weaker resistance, defeating and killing almost all the Kraków and Sandomierz nobility in the Battle of Tursko (13 February), and the Battles of Tarczek and Chmielnik (18 March), including the voivode of Kraków, Włodzimierz and the castellan Klement of Brzeźnica. All of Lesser Poland, including Kraków and Sandomierz, fell into the hands of the Mongols.

Henry did not wait for the promised aid from Western rulers and began to concentrate the surviving troops of Lesser Poland and his own Silesian and Greater Poland forces in Legnica. Europe&#x27;s rulers were more focused on the struggle between the Holy Roman Empire and Papacy, and they ignored Henry&#x27;s requests for help. The only foreign troops who joined him were those of King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia and the combined forces of some Knights Templar. Some sources report that European forces halted their troops near Legnica, probably fearing that the Christian Army would become an easy prey to the Mongols. The battle of Legnica took place on 9 April 1241. Henry was defeated and killed in action.

The defeat was widely blamed on the European monarchs, especially Emperor Frederick II and King Béla IV of Hungary, who had refused to help, and the unexpected retreat from the battle by Henry&#x27;s Upper Silesian cousin Mieszko II the Fat, through a trick of the Mongols. There are two descriptions of Henry&#x27;s death, one submitted by Jan Długosz (today considered dubious), and the second by C. de Brigia in his &quot;Historii Tartatorum&quot; (based on reports of direct witnesses, now considered more reliable). However, the Mongols did not intend to occupy the country, and shortly afterward they went through Moravia to Hungary, wanting to connect with the main army of Batu Khan. Henry&#x27;s naked and decapitated body could only be identified by his wife, because of his polydactyly. He had six toes on his left foot, which was confirmed when his tomb was opened in 1832. Henry was buried in the crypt of the Franciscan Church of Sts. Vincent and Jacob in Wrocław (Breslau).

Despite ruling for only three years, Henry remained in the memories of Silesia, Greater Poland and Kraków as the perfect Christian knight, lord and martyr, whose brilliant career was abruptly ended by his early death. Upon his death, the line of the Silesian Piasts fragmented into numerous dukes of Silesia, who (except for Henry&#x27;s grandson Henry IV Probus) were no longer able to prevail as Polish high dukes and subsequently came under the influence of the neighbouring Kingdom of Bohemia.

In 1944, Henry the Pious&#x27; body went missing after being taken from its tomb by German scientists for laboratory tests; they had hoped to prove that the prince was Aryan.

==Marriage and children==
Between 1214 and 1218, Henry married Anna (ca. 1201 – 23 June 1265), daughter of King Ottokar I of Bohemia. They had:
# Gertrude (1218/20 – 23/30 April 1244/47), married in 1232 to Bolesław I of Masovia.
# Constance (1221/27 – 1253/3 May 1257), married in 1239 to Casimir I of Kuyavia.
# Bolesław II the Horned (1220/25 – 26/31 December 1278)
# Mieszko (1223/27 – 1241/1242).
# Henry III the White (1222/30 – 3 December 1266)
# Elizabeth (1224/1232 – 16 January 1265), married in 1244 to Przemysł I of Greater Poland.
# Konrad (1228/31 – 6 August 1273/1274)
# Władysław (1237 – 27 April 1270, buried Salzburg Cathedral), Chancellor of Bohemia (1256), Bishop of Passau (1265) and Archbishop of Salzburg (1265–70)
# Agnes (123/1236 – 14 May after 1277), Abbess of St. Clara in Trebnitz.
# Hedwig (1238/41 – 3 April 1318), Abbess of St. Clara in Wrocław.

<doc id="67215" wikidata="Q1402189" url="?curid=67215" title="Melchiorre Murenu">
<text>Melchiorre Murenu (Macomer 1803 – 1854) was a blind Sardinian poet.
Melchiorre Murenu is known as the &quot;Homer of Sardinia&quot; because (just like the great Greek poet) he was blind and lived his entire life for poetry.

He was born in Macomer where he lived his entire life. At the age of three he became blind because of smallpox. Murenu&#x27;s father was imprisoned when Melchiorre was ten years old, and is thought to have died during his imprisonment. This unfortunate circumstance drove Murenu&#x27;s family in poverty (Murenu spoke of the difficult times of his childhood in the poem &quot;Supplica a Monsignore Bua&quot;). In these difficult circumstances Murenu could not afford to be formally educated, and he enjoyed spending time at the local church. There he acquainted himself to the biblical texts and, thanks to a prodigious memory, he could recite entire passages of the scriptures, as well as the daily sermons, entirely by heart.

Despite this background (or, perhaps, because of it), poverty and oppression are the main subjects of Murenu&#x27;s poetry. Among his most famous lyrics are &quot;Supplica a Monsignore Bua&quot; (&quot;Supplique to Mgr. Rua&quot;, about his family&#x27;s misfortunes), &quot; S&#x27;istadu de Sardigna &quot; (&quot;State of Sardinia&quot;, about the pervasive injustice against the defenseless people of Sardinia), and &quot;Tancas serradas a muru&quot; (&quot;walled lands&quot;), a quartile about the appropriation of lands.

Another famous composition by Murenu sealed his fate; it is &quot;Sas isporchizias de Bosa&quot; (&quot;Bosa&#x27;s filth&quot;), a fictional (and decidedly unflattering) description of the city of Bosa. It is commonly thought that because of this poem, some of Bosa&#x27;s inhabitants decided to avenge such offense by killing him. The night of 21 October 1854, three men, claiming to be there on behalf of a poet known to Murenu, lured him out of his place and pushed him over a cliff.

<text>A Martian meteorite is a rock that formed on Mars, was ejected from the planet by an impact event, and traversed interplanetary space before landing on Earth as a meteorite. , 277 meteorites had been classified as Martian, less than half a percent of the 72,000 meteorites that have been classified. The largest complete, uncut Martian meteorite, Taoudenni 002, was recovered in Mali in early 2021. It weighs 14.5 kilograms (32 pounds) and is on display at the Maine Mineral and Gem Museum. 

There are three groups of Martian meteorite: shergottites, nakhlites and chassignites, collectively known as SNC meteorites. Several other Martian meteorites are ungrouped. These meteorites are interpreted as Martian because they have elemental and isotopic compositions that are similar to rocks and atmospheric gases on Mars, which have been measured by orbiting spacecraft, surface landers and rovers. The term does not include meteorites found on Mars, such as Heat Shield Rock.

== History ==
By the early 1980s, it was obvious that the SNC group of meteorites (Shergottites, Nakhlites, and Chassignites) were significantly different from most other meteorite types. Among these differences were younger formation ages, a different oxygen isotopic composition, the presence of aqueous weathering products, and some similarity in chemical composition to analyses of the Martian surface rocks in 1976 by the Viking landers. Several scientists suggested these characteristics implied the origin of SNC meteorites from a relatively large parent body, possibly Mars. 

Then in 1983, various trapped gases were reported in impact-formed glass of the EET79001 shergottite, gases which closely resembled those in the Martian atmosphere as analyzed by Viking. These trapped gases provided direct evidence for a Martian origin. In 2000, an article by Treiman, Gleason and Bogard gave a survey of all the arguments used to conclude the SNC meteorites (of which 14 had been found at the time) were from Mars. They wrote, &quot;There seems little likelihood that the SNCs are not from Mars. If they were from another planetary body, it would have to be substantially identical to Mars as it now is understood.&quot;

==Subdivision==
As of April 25, 2018, 192 of the 207 Martian meteorites are divided into three rare groups of achondritic (stony) meteorites: &quot;shergottites&quot; (169), &quot;nakhlites&quot; (20), &quot;chassignites&quot; (3), and ones otherwise (15) (containing the orthopyroxenite (OPX) Allan Hills 84001, as well as 10 basaltic breccia meteorites). Consequently, Martian meteorites as a whole are sometimes referred to as the &quot;SNC group&quot; (pronounced ). They have isotope ratios that are consistent with each other and inconsistent with a terrestrial origin. The names derive from the location of where the first meteorite of their type was discovered.

===Shergottites===
Roughly three-quarters of all Martian meteorites can be classified as shergottites. They are named after the Shergotty meteorite, which fell at Sherghati, India in 1865. Shergottites are igneous rocks of mafic to ultramafic lithology. They fall into three main groups, the basaltic, olivine-phyric (such as the Tissint group found in Morocco in 2011) and Lherzolitic shergottites, based on their crystal size and mineral content. They can be categorised alternatively into three or four groups based on their rare-earth element content. These two classification systems do not line up with each other, hinting at complex relationships between the various source rocks and magmas from which the shergottites formed.
The shergottites appear to have crystallised as recently as 180 million years ago, which is a surprisingly young age considering how ancient the majority of the surface of Mars appears to be, and the small size of Mars itself. Because of this, some have advocated the idea that the shergottites are much older than this. This &quot;Shergottite Age Paradox&quot; remains unsolved and is still an area of active research and debate.

It has been suggested the 3-million-year-old crater Mojave, 58.5 km in diameter, was a potential source of these meteorites. A paper published in 2021, however, disputes this, proposing instead the 28 km crater Tooting, or possibly the crater 09-000015 as the crater source of the depleted olivine-phyric shergottites ejected 1.1 Ma ago.

===Nakhlites===
Nakhlites are named after the first of them, the Nakhla meteorite, which fell in El-Nakhla, Alexandria, Egypt in 1911 and had an estimated weight of 10 kg.

Nakhlites are igneous rocks that are rich in augite and were formed from basaltic magma from at least four eruptions, spanning around 90 million years, from 1416 ± 7 to 1322 ± 10 million years ago. They contain augite and olivine crystals. Their crystallization ages, compared to a crater count chronology of different regions on Mars, suggest the nakhlites formed on the large volcanic construct of either Tharsis, Elysium, or Syrtis Major Planum.

It has been shown that the nakhlites were suffused with liquid water around 620 million years ago and that they were ejected from Mars around 10.75 million years ago by an asteroid impact. They fell to Earth within the last 10,000 years.

===Chassignites===
The first chassignite, the Chassigny meteorite, fell at Chassigny, Haute-Marne, France in 1815. There has been only one other chassignite recovered, named Northwest Africa (NWA) 2737. NWA 2737 was found in Morocco or Western Sahara in August 2000 by meteorite hunters Bruno Fectay and Carine Bidaut, who gave it the temporary name &quot;Diderot.&quot; It was shown by Beck &quot;et al.&quot; that its &quot;mineralogy, major and trace element chemistry as well as oxygen isotopes revealed an unambiguous Martian origin and strong affinities with Chassigny.&quot;

===Ungrouped meteorites===

Among these, the famous specimen Allan Hills 84001 has a different rock type from other Martian meteorites: it is an orthopyroxenite (an igneous rock dominantly composed of orthopyroxene). For this reason it is classified within its own group, the &quot;OPX Martian meteorites&quot;. This meteorite received much attention after an electron microscope revealed structures that were considered to be the fossilized remains of bacteria-like lifeforms. , scientific consensus was that the microfossils were not indicative of Martian life, but of contamination by earthly biofilms. ALH 84001 is as old as the basaltic and intermediate shergottite groups i.e., 4.1 billion years old.

In March 2004 it was suggested that the unique Kaidun meteorite, which landed in Yemen on December 3, 1980, may have originated on the Martian moon of Phobos. Because Phobos has similarities to C-type asteroids and because the Kaidun meteorite is a carbonaceous chondrite, Kaidun is not a Martian meteorite in the strict sense. However, it may contain small fragments of material from the Martian surface.

The Martian meteorite NWA 7034 (nicknamed &quot;Black Beauty&quot;), found in the Sahara desert during 2011, has ten times the water content of other Mars meteorites found on Earth. The meteorite contains components as old as 4.42 ± 0.07 Ga (billion years), and was heated during the Amazonian geologic period on Mars.

A meteorite that fell in 1986 in Dayanpo, China contained a magnesium silicate mineral called &quot;Elgoresyte&quot;, a mineral not found on Earth.

==Origin==
The majority of SNC meteorites are quite young compared to most other meteorites and seem to imply that volcanic activity was present on Mars only a few hundred million years ago. The young formation ages of Martian meteorites was one of the early recognized characteristics that suggested their origin from a planetary body such as Mars. Among Martian meteorites, only ALH 84001 and NWA 7034 have radiometric ages older than about 1400 Ma (Ma = million years). All nakhlites, as well as Chassigny and NWA 2737, give similar if not identical formation ages around 1300 Ma, as determined by various radiometric dating techniques. Formation ages determined for many shergottites are variable and much younger, mostly ~150–575 Ma.

The chronological history of shergottites is not totally understood, and a few scientists have suggested that some may actually have formed prior to the times given by their radiometric ages, a suggestion not accepted by most scientists. Formation ages of SNC meteorites are often linked to their cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages, as measured from the nuclear products of interactions of the meteorite in space with energetic cosmic ray particles. Thus, all measured nakhlites give essentially identical CRE ages of approximately 11 Ma, which when combined with their possible identical formation ages indicates ejection of nakhlites into space from a single location on Mars by a single impact event. Some of the shergottites also seem to form distinct groups according to their CRE ages and formation ages, again indicating ejection of several different shergottites from Mars by a single impact. However, CRE ages of shergottites vary considerably (~0.5–19 Ma), and several impact events are required to eject all the known shergottites. It had been asserted that there are no large young craters on Mars that are candidates as sources for the Martian meteorites, but subsequent studies claimed to have a likely source for ALH 84001, and a possible source for other shergottites.

In a 2014 paper, several researchers claimed that all shergottites meteorites come from the Mojave Crater on Mars.

===Age estimates based on cosmic ray exposure===

The amount of time spent in transit from Mars to Earth can be estimated by measurements of the effect of cosmic radiation on the meteorites, particularly on isotope ratios of noble gases. The meteorites cluster in families that seem to correspond to distinct impact events on Mars. It is thought that the meteorites all originate in relatively few impacts every few million years on Mars. The impactors would be kilometers in diameter and the craters they form on Mars tens of kilometers in diameter. Models of impacts on Mars are consistent with these findings.

Ages since impact determined so far include
==Possible evidence of life==
Several Martian meteorites have been found to contain what some think is evidence for fossilized Martian life forms. The most significant of these is a meteorite found in the Allan Hills of Antarctica (ALH 84001). Ejection from Mars seems to have taken place about 16 million years ago. Arrival on Earth was about 13 000 years ago. Cracks in the rock appear to have filled with carbonate materials (implying groundwater was present) between 4 and 3.6 billion-years-ago. Evidence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been identified with the levels increasing away from the surface. Other Antarctic meteorites do not contain PAHs. Earthly contamination should presumably be highest at the surface. Several minerals in the crack fill are deposited in phases, specifically, iron deposited as magnetite, that are claimed to be typical of biodepositation on Earth. There are also small ovoid and tubular structures that might be nanobacteria fossils in carbonate material in crack fills (investigators McKay, Gibson, Thomas-Keprta, Zare). Micropaleontologist Schopf, who described several important terrestrial bacterial assemblages, examined ALH 84001 and opined that the structures are too small to be Earthly bacteria and don&#x27;t look especially like lifeforms to him. The size of the objects is consistent with Earthly &quot;nanobacteria&quot;, but the existence of nanobacteria itself has been largely discredited.

Many studies disputed the validity of the fossils. For example, it was found that most of the organic matter in the meteorite was of terrestrial origin. But, a recent study suggests that magnetite in the meteorite could have been produced by Martian microbes. The study, published in the journal of the Geochemical and Meteoritic Society, used more advanced high resolution electron microscopy than was possible in 1996. A serious difficulty with the claims for a biogenic origin of the magnetites is that the majority of them exhibit topotactic crystallographic relationships with the host carbonates (i.e., there are 3D orientation relationships between the magnetite and carbonate lattices), which is strongly indicative that the magnetites have grown in-situ by a physico-chemical mechanism.

While water is no indication of life, many of the meteorites found on Earth have shown water, including NWA 7034 which formed during the Amazonian period of Martian geological history. Other signs of surface liquid water on Mars (such as recurring slope lineae) are a topic of debate among planetary scientists, but generally consistent with the earlier evidence provided by Martian meteorites. Any liquid water present is likely too minimal to support life.

<text>Foreskin restoration or foreskin reconstruction refers to the process of recreating the foreskin of the penis, which has been removed by circumcision or injury. Foreskin restoration is primarily accomplished by stretching the residual skin of the penis, but surgical methods also exist. Restoration creates a facsimile of the foreskin, but specialized tissues removed during circumcision cannot be reclaimed. Some forms of restoration involve only partial regeneration in instances of a &quot;high-cut&quot; wherein the circumcisee feels that the circumciser removed too much skin and that there is not enough skin for erections to be comfortable.

== History ==
In the Greco-Roman world, uncircumcised genitals, including the foreskin, were considered a sign of beauty, civility, and masculinity. In Classical Greek and Roman societies (8th century BC to 6th century AD), exposure of the glans was considered disgusting and improper, and did not conform to the Hellenistic ideal of gymnastic nudity. Men with short foreskins would wear the kynodesme to prevent exposure. As a consequence of this social stigma, an early form of foreskin restoration known as &quot;epispasm&quot; was practiced among some Jews in Ancient Rome (8th century BC to 5th century AD).

Foreskin restoration is of ancient origin and dates back to the Alexandrian Empire (333 BC). Males participated in the gymnasium nude and because the Greeks did not practice circumcision anyone who was circumcised was socially shunned. Hellenized Jews stopped circumcising their sons to avoid persecution and so they could participate in the gymnasium. Some Jews at this time attempted to restore their foreskins. This caused conflict within Second Temple Judaism, some Jews viewed circumcision as an essential part of the Jewish identity (1 Maccabees 1:15). Following the death of Alexander, Judea and the Levant was part of the Seleucid Empire under Antiochus Epiphanes (175-164 BC). Antiochus outlawed the Jewish practice of circumcision, both 1st and 2nd Maccabees records Jewish mothers being put to death for circumcising their sons (1:60-61 and 6:10 respectively). Some Jews during Antiochus&#x27; persecution sought to undo their circumcision. Within the 1st century A.D., there was still some forms of foreskin restoration being sought after (1 Corinthians 7:18). During the third Jewish-Roman Wars (AD 132–135), the Romans had renamed Jerusalem as Aelia Capitolian and may have banned circumcision; however, Roman sources from the period only mention castration and say nothing about banning circumcision. During the Bar Kokhba revolt, there is Rabbinic evidence that records, Jews who had removed their circumcision (meaning that foreskin restoration was still being practiced) they were recircumcised, voluntarily or by force. Again, during World War II, some European Jews sought foreskin restoration to avoid Nazi persecution.

== Non-surgical techniques ==
=== Tissue expansion ===

Non-surgical foreskin restoration, accomplished through tissue expansion, is the more commonly used method.

Tissue expansion has long been known to stimulate mitosis, and research shows that regenerated human tissues have the attributes of the original tissue.

==== Methods and devices ====
During restoration via tissue expansion, the remaining penile skin is pulled forward over the glans, and tension is maintained either manually or through the aid of a foreskin restoration device.

== Surgical techniques ==
=== Foreskin reconstruction ===
Surgical methods of foreskin restoration, known as foreskin reconstruction, usually involve a method of grafting skin onto the distal portion of the penile shaft. The grafted skin is typically taken from the scrotum, which contains the same smooth muscle (known as dartos fascia) as does the skin of the penis. One method involves a four-stage procedure in which the penile shaft is buried in the scrotum for a period of time.

== Results ==
=== Physical aspects ===

Restoration creates a facsimile of the prepuce, but specialized tissues removed during circumcision cannot be reclaimed. Surgical procedures exist to reduce the size of the opening once restoration is complete (as depicted in the image above), or it can be alleviated through a longer commitment to the skin expansion regime to allow more skin to collect at the tip.

The natural foreskin is composed of smooth dartos muscle tissue (called the &quot;peripenic muscle&quot;), large blood vessels, extensive innervation, outer skin, and inner mucosa.

The process of foreskin restoration seeks to regenerate some of the tissue removed by circumcision, as well as provide coverage of the glans. According to research, the foreskin comprises over half of the skin and mucosa of the human penis.

In a survey restorers reported restoration; increased their sexual pleasure for 69% and improved their relationship for 25% 

== Organizations ==

Various groups have been founded since the late 20th century, especially in North America where circumcision has been routinely performed on infants. In 1989, the National Organization of Restoring Men (NORM) was founded as a non-profit support group for men undertaking foreskin restoration. In 1991, the group UNCircumcising Information and Resource Centers (UNCIRC) was formed, which was incorporated into NORM in 1994. NORM chapters have been founded throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. In France, there are two associations about this. The &quot;Association contre la Mutilation des Enfants&quot; AME (association against child mutilation), and more recently &quot;Droit au Corps&quot; (right to the body).

<text>A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes is a book on theoretical cosmology by the physicist Stephen Hawking. It was first published in 1988. Hawking wrote the book for readers who had no prior knowledge of physics.

In &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, Hawking writes in non-technical terms about the structure, origin, development and eventual fate of the universe, which is the object of study of astronomy and modern physics. He talks about basic concepts like space and time, basic building blocks that make up the universe (such as quarks) and the fundamental forces that govern it (such as gravity). He writes about cosmological phenomena such as the Big Bang and black holes. He discusses two major theories, general relativity and quantum mechanics, that modern scientists use to describe the universe. Finally, he talks about the search for a unifying theory that describes everything in the universe in a coherent manner.

The book became a bestseller and has sold more than 25 million copies in 40 languages.

Later, Stephen Hawking with Leonard Mlodinow published the abridged version of &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, titled as &quot;A Briefer History of Time&quot; in 2005.

==Publication==
Early in 1983, Hawking first approached Simon Mitton, the editor in charge of astronomy books at Cambridge University Press, with his ideas for a popular book on cosmology. Mitton was doubtful about all the equations in the draft manuscript, which he felt would put off the buyers in airport bookshops that Hawking wished to reach. With some difficulty, he persuaded Hawking to drop all but one equation. The author himself notes in the book&#x27;s acknowledgements that he was warned that for every equation in the book, the readership would be halved, hence it includes only a single equation: formula_1.

== Contents ==

In &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, Stephen Hawking explains a range of subjects in cosmology, including the Big Bang, black holes and light cones, to the non-specialist reader. His main goal is to give an overview of the subject, but he also attempts to explain some complex mathematics. In the 1996 edition of the book and subsequent editions, Hawking discusses the possibility of time travel and wormholes and explores the possibility of having a universe without a quantum singularity at the beginning of time. The 2017 edition of the book contained 12 chapters, whose contents are summarized below.

=== Chapter 1: Our Picture of the Universe ===

In the first chapter, Hawking discusses the history of astronomical studies, particularly ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle&#x27;s conclusions about spherical Earth and a circular geocentric model of the universe, later elaborated upon by the second-century Greek astronomer Ptolemy. Hawking then depicts the rejection of the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic model and the gradual development of the currently accepted heliocentric model of the Solar System, first proposed by the Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus in 1514, validated a century later by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei and German scientist Johannes Kepler, and further supported mathematically by English scientist Isaac Newton in his 1687 book on gravity, &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;.

In this chapter, Hawking also covers how the topic of the origin of the universe and time was studied and debated over the centuries: the perennial existence of the universe hypothesized by Aristotle and other early philosophers was opposed by St. Augustine and other theologians&#x27; belief in its creation at a specific time in the past, where time is a concept that was born with the creation of the universe. In the modern age, German philosopher Immanuel Kant argued again that time had no beginning. In 1929, American astronomer Edwin Hubble&#x27;s discovery of the expanding universe implied that between 10 billion and 20 billion years ago, the entire universe was contained in one singular extremely dense place. This discovery brought the concept of the beginning of the universe within the province of science. Currently scientists use Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics to partially describe the workings of the universe, while still looking for a complete Grand Unified Theory that would describe everything in the universe.

=== Chapter 2: Space and Time ===
In this chapter, Hawking describes the development of scientific thought regarding the nature of space and time. He first describes the Aristotelian idea that the naturally preferred state of a body is to be at rest, and which can only be moved by force, implying that heavier objects will fall faster. However, Italian scientist Galileo Galilei experimentally proved Aristotle&#x27;s theory wrong by observing the motion of objects of different weights and concluding that all objects would fall at the same rate. This eventually led to English scientist Isaac Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and gravity. However, Newton&#x27;s laws implied that there is no such thing as absolute state of rest or absolute space as believed by Aristotle: whether an object is &#x27;at rest&#x27; or &#x27;in motion&#x27; depends on the inertial frame of reference of the observer.

Hawking then describes Aristotle and Newton&#x27;s belief in absolute time, i.e. time can be measured accurately regardless of the state of motion of the observer. However, Hawking writes that this commonsense notion does not work at or near the speed of light. He mentions Danish scientist Ole Rømer&#x27;s discovery that light travels at a very high but finite speed through his observations of Jupiter and one of its moons Io as well as British scientist James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s equations on electromagnetism which showed that light travels in waves moving at a fixed speed. Since the notion of absolute rest was abandoned in Newtonian mechanics, Maxwell and many other physicists argued that light must travel through a hypothetical fluid called aether, its speed being relative to that of aether. This was later disproved by the Michelson–Morley experiment, showing that the speed of light always remains constant regardless of the motion of the observer. Einstein and Henri Poincaré later argued that there is no need for aether to explain the motion of light, assuming that there is no absolute time. The special theory of relativity is based on this, arguing that light travels with a finite speed no matter what the speed of the observer is.

Mass and energy are related by the equation formula_1, which explains that an infinite amount of energy is needed for any object with mass to travel at the speed of light (c = 3×10⁸m/s). A new way of defining a metre using speed of light was developed. &quot;Events&quot; can also be described by using light cones, a spacetime graphical representation that restricts what events are allowed and what are not based on the past and the future light cones. A 4-dimensional spacetime is also described, in which &#x27;space&#x27; and &#x27;time&#x27; are intrinsically linked. The motion of an object through space inevitably impacts the way in which it experiences time.

Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity explains how the path of a ray of light is affected by &#x27;gravity&#x27;, which according to Einstein is an illusion caused by the warping of spacetime, in contrast to Newton&#x27;s view which described gravity as a force which matter exerts on other matter. In spacetime curvature, light always travels in a straight path in the 4-dimensional &quot;spacetime&quot;, but may appear to curve in 3-dimensional space due to gravitational effects. These straight-line paths are geodesics. The twin paradox, a thought experiment in special relativity involving identical twins, considers that twins can age differently if they move at different speeds relative to each other, or even if they lived in different locations with unequal spacetime curvature. Special relativity is based upon arenas of space and time where events take place, whereas general relativity is dynamic where force could change spacetime curvature and which gives rise to a dynamic, expanding universe. Hawking and Roger Penrose worked upon this and later proved using general relativity that if the universe had a beginning a finite time ago in the past, then it also might end at a finite time from now into the future.

=== Chapter 3: The Expanding Universe ===

In this chapter, Hawking first describes how physicists and astronomers calculated the relative distance of stars from the Earth. In the 18th century, Sir William Herschel confirmed the positions and distances of many stars in the night sky. In 1924, Edwin Hubble discovered a method to measure the distance using the brightness of Cepheid variable stars as viewed from Earth. The luminosity, brightness, and distance of these stars are related by a simple mathematical formula. Using all these, he calculated distances of nine different galaxies. We live in a fairly typical spiral galaxy, containing vast numbers of stars.

The stars are very far away from us, so we can only observe their one characteristic feature, their light. When this light is passed through a prism, it gives rise to a spectrum. Every star has its own spectrum, and since each element has its own unique spectra, we can measure a star&#x27;s light spectra to know its chemical composition. We use thermal spectra of the stars to know their temperature. In 1920, when scientists were examining spectra of different galaxies, they found that some of the characteristic lines of the star spectrum were shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. The implications of this phenomenon were given by the Doppler effect, and it was clear that many galaxies were moving away from us.

It was assumed that, since some galaxies are red shifted, some galaxies would also be blue shifted. However, redshifted galaxies far outnumbered blue shifted galaxies. Hubble found that the amount of redshift is directly proportional to relative distance. From this, he determined that the universe is expanding and had a beginning. Despite this, the concept of a static universe persisted into the 20th century. Einstein was so sure of a static universe that he developed the &#x27;cosmological constant&#x27; and introduced &#x27;anti-gravity&#x27; forces to allow a universe of infinite age to exist. Moreover, many astronomers also tried to avoid the implications of general relativity and stuck with their static universe, with one especially notable exception, the Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann.

Friedmann made two very simple assumptions: the universe is identical wherever we are, i.e. homogeneity, and that it is identical in every direction that we look in, i.e. isotropy. His results showed that the universe is non-static. His assumptions were later proved when two physicists at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, found unexpected microwave radiation not only from the one particular part of the sky but from everywhere and by nearly the same amount. Thus Friedmann&#x27;s first assumption was proved to be true.

At around the same time, Robert H. Dicke and Jim Peebles were also working on microwave radiation. They argued that they should be able to see the glow of the early universe as background microwave radiation. Wilson and Penzias had already done this, so they were awarded with the Nobel Prize in 1978. In addition, our place in the universe is not exceptional, so we should see the universe as approximately the same from any other part of space, which supports Friedmann&#x27;s second assumption. His work remained largely unknown until similar models were made by Howard Robertson and Arthur Walker.

Friedmann&#x27;s model gave rise to three different types of models for the evolution of the universe. First, the universe would expand for a given amount of time, and if the expansion rate is less than the density of the universe (leading to gravitational attraction), it would ultimately lead to the collapse of the universe at a later stage. Secondly, the universe would expand, and at some time, if the expansion rate and the density of the universe became equal, it would expand slowly and stop, leading to a somewhat static universe. Thirdly, the universe would continue to expand forever, if the density of the universe is less than the critical amount required to balance the expansion rate of the universe.

The first model depicts the space of the universe to be curved inwards. In the second model, the space would lead to a flat structure, and the third model results in negative &#x27;saddle shaped&#x27; curvature. Even if we calculate, the current expansion rate is more than the critical density of the universe including the dark matter and all the stellar masses. The first model included the beginning of the universe as a Big Bang from a space of infinite density and zero volume known as &#x27;singularity&#x27;, a point where the general theory of relativity (Friedmann&#x27;s solutions are based in it) also breaks down.

This concept of the beginning of time (proposed by the Belgian Catholic priest Georges Lemaître) seemed originally to be motivated by religious beliefs, because of its support of the biblical claim of the universe having a beginning in time instead of being eternal. So a new theory was introduced, the &quot;steady state theory&quot; by Hermann Bondi, Thomas Gold, and Fred Hoyle, to compete with the Big Bang theory. Its predictions also matched with the current universe structure. But the fact that radio wave sources near us are far fewer than from the distant universe, and there were numerous more radio sources than at present, resulted in the failure of this theory and universal acceptance of the Big Bang Theory. Evgeny Lifshitz and Isaak Markovich Khalatnikov also tried to find an alternative to the Big Bang theory but also failed.

Roger Penrose used light cones and general relativity to prove that a collapsing star could result in a region of zero size and infinite density and curvature called a black hole. Hawking and Penrose proved together that the universe should have arisen from a singularity, which Hawking himself disproved once quantum effects are taken into account.

=== Chapter 4: The Uncertainty Principle ===
In this chapter, Hawking first discusses nineteenth-century French mathematician Laplace&#x27;s strong belief in scientific determinism, where scientific laws will eventually be able to accurately predict the future of the universe. Then he discusses the theory of infinite radiation of stars according to the calculations of British scientists Lord Rayleigh and James Jeans, which was later revised in 1900 by German scientist Max Planck who suggested that energy must radiate in small, finite packets called quanta.

Hawking then discusses the uncertainty principle formulated by German scientist Werner Heisenberg, according to which the speed and the position of a particle cannot be precisely known due to Planck&#x27;s quantum hypothesis: increasing the accuracy in measuring its speed will decrease the certainty of its position and vice versa. This disproved Laplace&#x27;s idea of a completely deterministic theory of the universe. Hawking then describes the eventual development of quantum mechanics by Heisenberg, Austrian physicist Erwin Schroedinger and English physicist Paul Dirac in the 1920s, a theory which introduced an irreducible element of unpredictability into science, and despite German scientist Albert Einstein&#x27;s strong objections, it has been proven to be very successful in describing the universe except for gravity and large-scale structures.

Hawking then discusses how Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle implies the wave–particle duality behaviour of light (and particles in general). 
He then describes the phenomenon of interference where multiple light waves interfere with each other to give rise to a single light wave with properties different from those of the component waves, as well as the interference within particles, exemplified by the two-slit experiment. Hawking writes how interference refined our understanding of the structure of atoms, the building blocks of matter. While Danish scientist Niels Bohr&#x27;s theory only partially solved the problem of collapsing electrons, quantum mechanics completely resolved it. According to Hawking, American scientist Richard Feynman&#x27;s sum over histories is a nice way of visualizing the wave-particle duality. Finally, Hawking mentions that Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity is a classical, non-quantum theory which ignores the uncertainty principle and that it has to be reconciled with quantum theory in situations where gravity is very strong, such as black holes and the Big Bang.

=== Chapter 5: Elementary Particles and Forces of Nature ===
In this chapter, Hawking traces the history of investigation about the nature of matter: Aristotle&#x27;s four elements, Democritus&#x27;s notion of indivisible atoms, John Dalton&#x27;s ideas about atoms combining to form molecules, J. J. Thomson&#x27;s discovery of electrons inside atoms, Ernest Rutherford&#x27;s discovery of atomic nucleus and protons, James Chadwick&#x27;s discovery of neutrons and finally Murray Gell-Mann&#x27;s work on even smaller quarks which make up protons and neutrons. Hawking then discusses the six different &quot;flavors&quot; (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top) and three different &quot;colors&quot; of quarks (red, green, and blue). Later in the chapter he discusses anti-quarks, which are outnumbered by quarks due to the expansion and cooling of the universe.
Hawking then discusses the &quot;spin&quot; property of particles, which determines what a particle looks like from different directions. Hawking then discusses two groups of particles in the universe based on their spin: fermions and bosons. Fermions, with a spin of 1/2, follow the &quot;Pauli exclusion principle&quot;, which states that they cannot share the same quantum state (for example, two &quot;spin up&quot; protons cannot occupy the same location in space). Without this rule, complex structures could not exist.

 Bosons or the force-carrying particles, with a spin of 0, 1, or 2, do not follow the exclusion principle. Hawking then gives the examples of &quot;virtual gravitons&quot; and &quot;virtual photons&quot;. Virtual gravitons, with a spin of 2, carry the force of gravity. Virtual photons, with a spin of 1, carry the electromagnetic force. Hawking then discusses the weak nuclear force (responsible for radioactivity and affecting mainly fermions) and the strong nuclear force carried by the particle gluon, which binds quarks together into hadrons, usually neutrons and protons, and also binds neutrons and protons together into atomic nuclei. Hawking then writes about the phenomenon called color confinement which prevents the discovery of quarks and gluons on their own (except at extremely high temperature) as they remain confined within hadrons.

Hawking writes that at extremely high temperature, the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force behave as a single electroweak force, giving rise to the speculation that at even higher temperatures, the electroweak force and strong nuclear force would also behave as a single force. Theories which attempt to describe the behaviour of this &quot;combined&quot; force are called Grand Unified Theories, which may help us explain many of the mysteries of physics that scientists have yet to solve.

=== Chapter 6: Black Holes ===

In this chapter, Hawking discusses black holes, regions of spacetime where extremely strong gravity prevents everything, including light, from escaping from within them. Hawking describes how most black holes are formed during the collapse of massive stars (at least 25 times heavier than the sun) approaching end of life. He writes about the event horizon, the black hole&#x27;s boundary from which no particle can escape to the rest of spacetime. Hawking then discusses non-rotating black holes with spherical symmetry and rotating ones with axisymmetry. Hawking then describes how astronomers discover a black hole not directly, but indirectly, by observing with special telescopes the powerful X-rays emitted when it consumes a star. Hawking ends the chapter by mentioning his famous bet made in 1974 with American physicist Kip Thorne in which Hawking argued that black holes did not exist. Hawking lost the bet as new evidence proved that Cygnus X-1 was indeed a black hole.

=== Chapter 7: Black Holes Ain&#x27;t So Black ===
This chapter discusses an aspect of black holes&#x27; behavior that Stephen Hawking discovered in the 1970s. According to earlier theories, black holes can only become larger, and never smaller, because nothing which enters a black hole can come out. However, in 1974, Hawking published a new theory which argued that black holes can &quot;leak&quot; radiation. He imagined what might happen if a pair of virtual particles appeared near the edge of a black hole. Virtual particles briefly &#x27;borrow&#x27; energy from spacetime itself, then annihilate each other, returning the borrowed energy and ceasing to exist. However, at the edge of a black hole, one virtual particle might be trapped by the black hole while the other escapes. Because of the second law of thermodynamics, particles are &quot;forbidden&quot; to take energy from the vacuum. Thus, the particle takes energy from the black hole instead of from the vacuum, and escape from the black hole as Hawking radiation.

According to Hawking, black holes must very slowly shrink over time and eventually &quot;evaporate&quot; because of this radiation, rather than continue existing forever as scientists had previously believed.

=== Chapter 8: The Origin and Fate of the Universe ===

The beginning and the end of the universe are discussed in this chapter.

Most scientists agree that the universe began in an expansion called the &quot;Big Bang&quot;. At the start of the Big Bang, the universe had an extremely high temperature, which prevented the formation of complex structures like stars, or even very simple ones like atoms. During the Big Bang, a phenomenon called &quot;inflation&quot; took place, in which the universe briefly expanded (&quot;inflated&quot;) to a much larger size. Inflation explains some characteristics of the universe that had previously greatly confused researchers. After inflation, the universe continued to expand at a slower pace. It became much colder, eventually allowing for the formation of such structures.

Hawking also discusses how the universe might have appeared differently if it grew in size slower or faster than it actually has. For example, if the universe expanded too slowly, it would collapse, and there would not be enough time for life to form. If the universe expanded too quickly, it would have become almost empty.

Hawking ultimately proposes the conclusion that the universe might be finite, but boundless. In other words, it may have no beginning nor ending in time, but merely exist with a finite amount of matter and energy.

The concept of quantum gravity is also discussed in this chapter.

=== Chapter 9: The Arrow of Time ===
In this chapter Hawking talks about why &quot;real time,&quot; as Hawking calls time as humans observe and experience it (in contrast to &quot;imaginary time,&quot; which Hawking claims is inherent to the laws of science) seems to have a certain direction, notably from the past towards the future. Hawking then discusses three &quot;arrows of time&quot; which, in his view, give time this property. Hawking&#x27;s first arrow of time is the thermodynamic arrow of time: the direction in which entropy (which Hawking calls disorder) increases. According to Hawking, this is why we never see the broken pieces of a cup gather themselves together to form a whole cup. Hawking&#x27;s second arrow is the psychological arrow of time, whereby our subjective sense of time seems to flow in one direction, which is why we remember the past and not the future. Hawking claims that our brain measures time in a way where disorder increases in the direction of time – we never observe it working in the opposite direction. In other words, he claims that the psychological arrow of time is intertwined with the thermodynamic arrow of time. Hawking&#x27;s third and final arrow of time is the cosmological arrow of time: the direction of time in which the universe is expanding rather than contracting. According to Hawking, during a contraction phase of the universe, the thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time would not agree.

Hawking then claims that the &quot;no boundary proposal&quot; for the universe implies that the universe will expand for some time before contracting back again. He goes on to argue that the no boundary proposal is what drives entropy and that it predicts the existence of a well-defined thermodynamic arrow of time if and only if the universe is expanding, as it implies that the universe must have started in a smooth and ordered state that must grow toward disorder as time advances. He argues that, because of the no boundary proposal, a contracting universe would not have a well-defined thermodynamic arrow and therefore only a universe that is in an expansion phase can support intelligent life. Using the weak anthropic principle, Hawking goes on to argue that the thermodynamic arrow must agree with the cosmological arrow in order for either to be observed by intelligent life. This, in Hawking&#x27;s view, is why humans experience these three arrows of time going in the same direction.

=== Chapter 10: Wormholes and Time Travel ===
In this chapter, Hawking discusses whether it is possible to time travel, i.e., travel into the future or the past. He shows how physicists have attempted to devise possible methods by humans with advanced technology may be able to travel faster than the speed of light, or travel backwards in time, and these concepts have become mainstays of science fiction. Einstein–Rosen bridges were proposed early in the history of general relativity research. These &quot;wormholes&quot; would appear identical to black holes from the outside, but matter which entered would be relocated to a different location in spacetime, potentially in a distant region of space, or even backwards in time. However, later research demonstrated that such a wormhole, even if possible for it to form in the first place, would not allow any material to pass through before turning back into a regular black hole. The only way that a wormhole could theoretically remain open, and thus allow faster-than-light travel or time travel, would require the existence of exotic matter with negative energy density, which violates the energy conditions of general relativity. As such, almost all physicists agree that faster-than-light travel and travel backwards in time are not possible.

Hawking also describes his own &quot;chronology protection conjecture&quot;, which provides a more formal explanation for why faster-than-light and backwards time travel are almost certainly impossible.

=== Chapter 11: The Unification of Physics ===
Quantum field theory (QFT) and general relativity (GR) describe the physics of the universe with astounding accuracy within their own domains of applicability. However, these two theories contradict each other. For example, the uncertainty principle of QFT is incompatible with GR. This contradiction, and the fact that QFT and GR do not fully explain observed phenomena, have led physicists to search for a theory of &quot;quantum gravity&quot; that is both internally consistent and explains observed phenomena just as well as or better than existing theories do.

Hawking is cautiously optimistic that such a unified theory of the universe may be found soon, in spite of significant challenges. At the time the book was written, &quot;superstring theory&quot; had emerged as the most popular theory of quantum gravity, but this theory and related string theories were still incomplete and had yet to be proven in spite of significant effort (this remains the case as of 2021). String theory proposes that particles behave like one-dimensional &quot;strings&quot;, rather than as dimensionless particles as they do in QFT. These strings &quot;vibrate&quot; in many dimensions. Instead of 3 dimensions as in QFT or 4 dimensions as in GR, superstring theory requires a total of 10 dimensions. The nature of the six &quot;hyperspace&quot; dimensions required by superstring theory are difficult if not impossible to study, leaving countless theoretical string theory landscapes which each describe a universe with different properties. Without a means to narrow the scope of possibilities, it is likely impossible to find practical applications for string theory.

Alternative theories of quantum gravity, such as loop quantum gravity, similarly suffer from a lack of evidence and difficulty to study.

Hawking thus proposes three possibilities: 1) there exists a complete unified theory that we will eventually find; 2) the overlapping characteristics of different landscapes will allow us to gradually explain physics more accurately with time and 3) there is no ultimate theory. The third possibility has been sidestepped by acknowledging the limits set by the uncertainty principle. The second possibility describes what has been happening in physical sciences so far, with increasingly accurate partial theories.

Hawking believes that such refinement has a limit and that by studying the very early stages of the universe in a laboratory setting, a complete theory of Quantum Gravity will be found in the 21st century allowing physicists to solve many of the currently unsolved problems in physics.

=== Conclusion ===
In this final chapter, Hawking summarises the efforts made by humans through their history to understand the universe and their place in it: starting from the belief in anthropomorphic spirits controlling nature, followed by the recognition of regular patterns in nature, and finally with the scientific advancement in recent centuries, the inner workings of the universe have become far better understood. He recalls the suggestion of the nineteenth-century French mathematician Laplace that the universe&#x27;s structure and evolution could eventually be precisely explained by a set of laws whose origin is left in God&#x27;s domain. However, Hawking states that the uncertainty principle introduced by the quantum theory in the twentieth century has set limits to the predictive accuracy of future laws to be discovered.

Hawking comments that historically, the study of cosmology (the study of the origin, evolution, and end of Earth and the universe as a whole) has been primarily motivated by a search for philosophical and religious insights, for instance, to better understand the nature of God, or even whether God exists at all. However, for Hawking, most scientists today who work on these theories approach them with mathematical calculation and empirical observation, rather than asking such philosophical questions. In his mind, the increasingly technical nature of these theories have caused modern cosmology to become increasingly divorced from philosophical discussion. Hawking nonetheless expresses hope that one day everybody would talk about these theories in order to understand the true origin and nature of the universe, and accomplish &quot;the ultimate triumph of human reasoning&quot;.

== Editions ==
* 1988: The first edition included an introduction by Carl Sagan that tells the following story: Sagan was in London for a scientific conference in 1974, and between sessions he wandered into a different room, where a larger meeting was taking place. &quot;I realized that I was watching an ancient ceremony: the investiture of new fellows into the Royal Society, one of the most ancient scholarly organizations on the planet. In the front row, a young man in a wheelchair was, very slowly, signing his name in a book that bore on its earliest pages the signature of Isaac Newton ... Stephen Hawking was a legend even then.&quot; In his introduction, Sagan goes on to add that Hawking is the &quot;worthy successor&quot; to Newton and Paul Dirac, both former Lucasian Professors of Mathematics.

The introduction was removed after the first edition, as it was copyrighted by Sagan, rather than by Hawking or the publisher, and the publisher did not have the right to reprint it in perpetuity. Hawking wrote his own introduction for later editions.
* 1994, A brief history of time – An interactive adventure. A CD-Rom with interactive video material created by S. W. Hawking, Jim Mervis, and Robit Hairman (available for Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, and Windows XP).
* 1996, Illustrated, updated and expanded edition: This hardcover edition contained full-color illustrations and photographs to help further explain the text, as well as the addition of topics that were not included in the original book.
* 1998, Tenth-anniversary edition: It features the same text as the one published in 1996, but was also released in paperback and has only a few diagrams included. 
* 2005, &quot;A Briefer History of Time&quot;: a collaboration with Leonard Mlodinow of an abridged version of the original book. It was updated again to address new issues that had arisen due to further scientific development. 

== Film ==
In 1991, Errol Morris directed a documentary film about Hawking; although they share a title, the film is a biographical study of Hawking, and not a filmed version of the book.

== Apps ==

&quot;Stephen Hawking&#x27;s Pocket Universe: A Brief History of Time Revisited&quot; is based on the book. The app was developed by Preloaded for Transworld publishers, a division of the Penguin Random House group.

The app was produced in 2016. It was designed by Ben Courtney and produced by Jemma Harris and is available on iOS only.

== Opera ==
The Metropolitan Opera commissioned an opera to premiere in the 2015–2016 season based on Hawking&#x27;s book. It was to be composed by Osvaldo Golijov with a libretto by Alberto Manguel in a production by Robert Lepage. The planned opera was changed to be about a different subject and eventually canceled completely.

<doc id="67229" wikidata="Q7745497" url="?curid=67229" title="The Large Scale Structure of Space–Time">
<text>The Large Scale Structure of Space–Time is a 1973 treatise on the theoretical physics of spacetime by the physicist Stephen Hawking and the mathematician George Ellis. It is intended for specialists in general relativity rather than newcomers.

==Background==
In the mid-1970s, advances in the technologies of astronomical observations – radio, infrared, and X-ray astronomy – opened up the Universe of exploration. New tools became necessary. In this book, Hawking and Ellis attempt to establish the axiomatic foundation for the geometry of four-dimensional spacetime as described by Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity and to derive its physical consequences for singularities, horizons, and causality. Whereas the tools for studying Euclidean geometry were a straightedge and a compass, those needed to investigate curved spacetime are test particles and light rays. According to the mathematical physicist John Baez from the University of California, Riverside, &quot;The Large Scale Structure of Space–Time&quot; was &quot;the first book to provide a detailed description of the revolutionary topological methods introduced by Penrose and Hawking in the early seventies.&quot;

Hawking co-wrote the book with Ellis, while he was postdoctoral fellow at the University of Cambridge. In his 1988 book &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, he describes &quot;The Large Scale Structure of Space–Time&quot; as &quot;highly technical&quot; and unreadable for the layperson.

The book, now considered a classic, has also appeared in paperback format and has been reprinted many times. A fiftieth anniversary edition was published by Cambridge University Press in February 2023.

== Assessment ==
Mathematician Nicholas Michael John Woodhouse at the University of Oxford considered this book to be an authoritative treatise that could become a classic. He observed that the authors begin with axioms of geometry and physics then derive the consequences in a rigorous fashion. Various well-known exact solutions to Einstein&#x27;s field equations and their physical meaning are explored. In particular, Hawking and Ellis show that singularities and black holes arise in a large class of plausible solutions. He warned that although this book is self-contained, it is more suitable for specialists rather than new students as it is heavy-going and contains no exercises. He noted that despite the authors&#x27; attempt at a rigorous treatment, certain technical terms, such as Lie groups, are used but never explained, and that modern coordinate-free methods are introduced, but not used effectively.

Theoretical physicist Rainer Sachs from the University of California, Berkeley, observed that &quot;The Large-Scale Structure of Space–Time&quot; was published within just a few years as &quot;Gravitation and Cosmology&quot; by Steven Weinberg and &quot;Gravitation&quot; by Charles Misner, Kip Thorne, and John Archibald Wheeler. He believed these three books can supplement each other and lead students to the forefront of research. Whereas Hawking and Ellis employ global analysis extensively but say relatively little about perturbative methods, the other two books neglect global analysis and cover in great detail perturbations. He believed Hawking and Ellis did a great job summarizing recent developments in the field (as of 1974) and that the intended audience is a doctoral student (or higher) with a strong mathematical background and prior exposure to general relativity. He argued that the core of the books consists of two chapters, Chapter 4 on the significance of spacetime curvature and Chapter 6 on causal structure, and that the most interesting application is the penultimate chapter on black holes. He noted that mathematical arguments are at times difficult to follow and suggested &quot;Techniques of Differential Topology in Relativity&quot; by Roger Penrose for reference. He also noticed a small number of errors, though none affect the general conclusions drawn by the authors. He thought that this book is a &quot;model&quot; presentation on the interplay between mathematics and physics that could become highly influential in the future.

Theoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler of Princeton University recommended this book to anyone interested in the implications of general relativity for cosmology, the singularity theorems, and the physics of black holes, presented in an almost Euclidean fashion, though he acknowledged that this is not a textbook due to its lack of examples and exercises. He praised its 62 illustrative diagrams.
