<text>Yeoman is a noun originally referring either to one who owns and cultivates land or to the middle ranks of servants in an English royal or noble household. The term was first documented in mid-14th-century England. The 14th century witnessed the rise of the yeoman longbow archers during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, and the yeoman outlaws celebrated in the Robin Hood ballads. Yeomen joined the English Navy during the Hundred Years&#x27; War as seamen and archers. In the early 15th century, yeoman was the rank of chivalry between page and squire. By the late 17th century, yeoman became a rank in the Royal Navy for the common seamen who were in charge of ship&#x27;s stores, such as foodstuffs, gunpowder, and sails.

References to the emerging social stratum of wealthy land-owning commoners began to appear after 1429. In that year, the Parliament of England re-organized the House of Commons into counties and boroughs, with voting rights granted to all freeholders. The Electors of Knights of the Shires Act 1429 restricted voting rights to those freeholders whose land value exceeded 40 shillings. These yeomen became a social stratum of commoners below the landed gentry, but above the husbandmen. This stratum later embodied the political and economic ideas of the English Enlightenment and Scottish Enlightenment, and transplanted those ideas to British North America during the early modern era.

Numerous yeoman farmers in North America served as citizen soldiers in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The 19th century saw a revival of interest in the medieval period with English Romantic literature. The yeoman outlaws of the ballads were refashioned into heroes fighting for justice under the law and the rights of freeborn Englishmen.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of yeoman is uncertain, for several reasons.

The earliest documented use occurs in Middle English. There are no known Old English words which are considered acceptable parent words for yeoman. Nor are there any readily identifiable cognates of yeoman in Anglo-Norman, Old Frisian, Old Dutch, Old Saxon, or Middle Low German. The four last-named of these languages are West Germanic languages, closely related to Old English at the time they were spoken. Taken together, these facts would indicate that yeoman (1) is a word specific to the regional dialects found in England; and (2) is nothing similar to any word used in continental Europe.

Another complicating factor for the etymology is that yeoman is a compound word made by joining two other words: &quot;yeo&quot; + &quot;man&quot;. Linguists have been perplexed about the origin of &quot;yeo&quot; since scholars such as John Mitchell Kemble and Joseph Bosworth began the modern linguistic study of Old English in the early to mid 19th century. Two possible etymologies have been proposed to explain the origin of &quot;yeo&quot;.

=== &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; ===
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) has proposed that yeoman is derived from &quot;yongerman&quot;, which first appeared in a manuscript called &quot;Pseudo-Cnut&#x27;s Constitutiones de Foresta&quot;. Although the manuscript has been demonstrated to be a forgery (it was produced during the reign of King Henry II of England, rather than during the reign of King Cnut), it is considered authentic to the 11th and 12th century forest laws. According to the OED, the manuscript refers to 3 social classes: (1) the thegn (noble) at the top; (2) the tunman (townman) at the bottom; and (3) the lesser thegn in the middle. &quot;Yongerman&quot; is considered a synonym for a lesser thegn. OED suggested that &quot;yongerman&quot; is related to &quot;youngman&quot;, meaning a male youth or young male adult who was in the service of a high-ranking individual or family.

This proposed etymology is that &quot;youngman&quot; is in turn related to Old Norse &quot;ungmenni&quot; (youths); North Frisian &quot;ongman&quot; (lad, fellow); Dutch &quot;jongeman&quot; (youngman); and German &quot;Jungmann&quot; (deckhand, ordinary seaman); cf. also German &quot;&quot; ⇐ &quot;jung[er] Herr&quot;. This etymology provides a plausible semantic link from &quot;yongerman&quot; to &quot;youngman&quot;, while at the same time providing most of the earliest definitions of yeoman.

=== &quot;Chambers Dictionary of Etymology&quot; ===
The &quot;Chambers Dictionary of Etymology&quot; (CDE) is another well-respected scholarly source, as it is published by the same company which produces &quot;The Chambers Dictionary&quot;. Their proposed etymology reconstructs a possible Old English word, &quot;*ġēamann&quot;, as the parent of yeoman. (The asterisk or star as the first letter is a linguistic convention to indicate the word has been reconstructed, and is unattested in any surviving record). The reconstructed word is a compound word made from the root word &quot;ġē&quot;, &quot;ġēa&quot; (district, region) + &quot;mann&quot; (man). To further strengthen their etymology, CDE compares their reconstructed word to Old Frisian &quot;gāman&quot; (villager), and modern West Frisian &quot;gea&quot;, &quot;goa&quot;, Dutch &quot;gouw&quot;, German &quot;Gau&quot; (district, region).

When comparing the simpler and more comprehensive OED etymology with the CDE etymology, modern linguists have expressed dissatisfaction with the CDE version.

== Medieval meanings ==

In the history of the English language, the earliest recorded usage of yeoman occurs in the Late Middle English period, and then becoming more widespread in the Early Modern English period. The transition from Middle English to Early Modern English was a gradual process occurring over decades. For the sake of assigning a historical date, OED defines the end of Middle English and the beginning of Early Modern English as occurring in 1500. The year 1500 marks the end of nearly 200 years of political and economic upheaval in England. The Hundred Years War, the recurring episodes of the Black Death, and over 32 years of civil war known as the War of the Roses all contributed to the end of the Middle Ages in England, and the beginning of the English Renaissance. It was during this time that English gradually replaced Norman French as the official language.

The first single-language dictionary of the English language, Robert Cawdrey&#x27;s &quot;Table Alphabeticall&quot;, was published in 1604. The dictionary only included unusual English words, and loan words from foreign languages such as Hebrew, Greek, Latin, or French. Yeoman is not included in this dictionary. This suggests that in 1604, yeoman was a very commonly-used English word.
A more comprehensive, or general dictionary, was published in 1658. Edward Phillips&#x27; &quot;The New World of English Words&quot; contained basic definitions. Yeoman is included; probably for the first time in an English language dictionary. But only a legal definition was given: (1) a social class immediately below a Gentleman; and (2) a freeborn man who can sell &quot;his own free land in yearly revenue to the summe of 40 shillings Sterling&quot;. The fact that only the legal definition (introduced in the Electors of Knights of the Shires Act 1429) was given is another suggestion that yeoman was a common word at the time.

Between the 12th century &quot;Pseudo-Cnut de Foresta&quot; and &quot;The New World of English Words&quot; in 1658, linguists have had to re-construct the meanings of yeoman from the surviving manuscripts. The various meanings of yeoman were apparently widely understood by the document author and his audience, and were not explained in the manuscripts. Linguists have deduced these specific historical meanings based on the context in which yeoman was used within the document itself. It is these meanings which are described in the following sections.

=== Household attendant or servant (14th century-present) ===

Yeoman, as a household servant, is one of the earliest documented uses of the word. During the 14th century, it referred to a servant or attendant in a royal or noble household, usually one who was of higher rank in the household hierarchy. This hierarchy reflected the feudal society in which they lived. Everyone who served a royal or noble household knew their duties, and knew their place. This was especially important when the household staff consisted of both nobles and commoners. There were actually two household hierarchies which existed in parallel. One was the organization based upon the function (duty) being performed. The other was based upon whether the person performing the duty was a noble or a commoner.
Similar household duties were grouped into Household Offices, which were then assigned to one of several Chief Officers. In each Household Office, the servants were organized into a hierarchy, arranged in ranks according to the level of responsibility.
; Sergeant
: The highest rank, which reported directly to the Chief Officer and oversaw an individual Household Office. The word was introduced to England by the Normans, and meant an attendant or servant.
; Yeoman
: The middle rank of the Household Office.
; Groom
: The lowest rank of the Household Office. It generally referred to a menial position for a free-born commoner.
The Chief Officers were nobles, but the servant ranks of Sergeant, Yeoman, and Groom
could be filled by either commoners or members of noble families. Any household duties which required close contact with the lord&#x27;s immediate family, or their rooms, were handled by nobles.
For example, the Steward oversaw the Offices concerned with household management. Procurement, storage, and preparation of food, waiting at table, and tending to the kitchen gardens, were some of the duties for which the Steward was responsible. Under the Steward during the reign of King Edward III, there were two separate groups of yeomen: &quot;Yeomen of the King&#x27;s Chamber&quot; and &quot;Yeomen of the Offices&quot;. The first group were members of noble families who waited only on the King, and the second group were commoners who performed similar duties for other household residents and guests in the Great Hall, kitchen, pantry, and other areas.

=== Yeoman service ===

Yeoman service (also yeoman&#x27;s service) is an idiom which means &quot;good, efficient, and useful service&quot; in some cause. It has the connotations of the work performed by a faithful servant of the lower ranks, who does whatever it takes to get the job done.
The sense – although not the use – of the idiom can be found in the &quot;Gest of Robyn Hode&quot;, dated to about 1500. In the &quot;First Fitte&quot; (the first section of the ballad), Robin gives money to a poor knight to pay his debt to the abbot of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey. Noticing that the knight was traveling alone, Robin offers him the service of Little John as a yeoman:

Here Robin vouches for Little John as a yeoman, a faithful servant who will perform whatever duties are required in times of great need.

The phrase &quot;yeoman&#x27;s service&quot; is used by William Shakespeare in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (published in 1601). In act V, scene 2, Prince Hamlet tells Horatio how he discovered the king&#x27;s plot against himself in a commission (document). Hamlet then says he has substituted for the original a commission which he himself wrote:

Hamlet remarks that he &quot;wrote it fair&quot;, that is, in elegant, gentlemanly prose; a style of writing which he tried very hard to forget. But in composing the fake commission, Hamlet had to resort to &quot;that learning&quot;. He tells Horatio that &quot;it did me yeoman&#x27;s service&quot;, that is, his learning stood him in good stead. &quot;Standing one in good stead&quot; is another idiom very similar in meaning to yeoman service. Note that it was used in the third line of Stanza of the &quot;Gest of Robyn Hode&quot; quoted in the paragraph above.

=== Attendant or assistant to an official (ca 14th–17th centuries) ===

Marshalsea Court was a court of the English royal household, presided over by the Steward and the Knight-Marshal. The court kept records from about 1276 until 1611. Unfortunately, only a few survive from the years 1316–59. Some information on the yeomen of the Marshalsea Court can be found in the Household Ordinance of King Edward IV from about 1483. The author of the Ordinance, looking back to the earlier household ordinances of King Edward III wrote: &quot;Our sovereign lord&#x27;s household is now discharged ... of the Court of Marshalsea, and all his clerks and yeomen.&quot; The writer was referring to the transfer of the Marshalsea Court from the royal household.

The Ordinance describe the duties of the Steward of the Household, who was also the Steward of the Court of Marshalsea. The Steward was assigned one chaplain, two squires, and four yeomen as his personal retinue. One yeoman was specifically attached to the Steward&#x27;s rooms at the Court of Marshalsea &quot;to keep his chamber and stuff&quot;. When the Steward was present in Court, he was entitled to a 10-person retinue. Besides the Steward and the Knight-Marshal, two other members of the royal household were empowered to preside: the Treasurer and the Controller. Of the Steward, Treasurer, and the Controller, at least one of them must preside in the Court every day.

=== A chivalric rank ===

One of the earliest documents which contains yeoman as a chivalric rank is the &quot;Chronicon Vilodunense&quot; (&quot;Life of Saint Edith&quot;). Originally written in Latin by Goscelin sometime in the 11th century, it was later translated into the Wiltshire dialect of Middle English about 1420. Part of the manuscript relates a story about the archbishop of York caught in a storm at sea while on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He prayed to Saint Edith for the storm to subside, and suddenly he saw Saint Edith standing beside him. The Blessed Virgin had sent her, she said, to assure the archbishop he would arrive home safe and sound. Miraculously, the storm stopped. The archbishop kept his vow, and visited St Edith&#x27;s tomb at Wilton Abbey. There he preached a sermon about the miracle to each man there: knight, squire, yeoman, and page.

Although Wilton Abbey was a Benedictine nunnery, it held its lands from the king by knight service. The Abbess&#x27; knights were her tenants, who in turn held land from the Abbey by knight service. Usually the abbess fulfilled her duty to the king by scutage. But she had knights with King Henry III on his 1223 Welsh campaign, and at the Siege of Bedford Castle the following year. Between 1277 and 1327 she offered knight service at least four times.

About 50 years later in 1470, another reference to yeomen is made in the Warkworth Chronicle. The scene is King Edward IV&#x27;s coronation, and the chronicler lists the nobles who received titles from His Majesty. At the end of the list he notes: &quot;And other gentlemen and yeomen he made knights and squires, as they had deserved.&quot; (modern spelling) The chronicler makes no further mention of these men.

=== Yeomanry (14th–15th centuries) ===

An early historical meaning that seems to have disappeared before our modern era is &quot;something pertaining to or characteristic of a yeoman&quot;, such as the speech or the dress. Perhaps the best way of illustrating this meaning is to quote briefly from one of the earliest Middle English ballads. &quot;Robin Hood and the Potter&quot; survives as a manuscript dated from about 1500. Robin demands a one penny toll of the Potter, for which the traveler could then proceed unharmed by the outlaw. The Potter refuses to pay. A scuffle ensues, in which the Potter overcomes Robin. The Potter then wants to know whom he has beaten. After hearing Robin&#x27;s name, the Potter responds (modern translation from glossary notes):

In the first stanza the Potter describes himself as a poor yeoman, whom people say Robin Hood would never stop or waylay (also known as a holdup). It is obvious from the story that the Potter was not dressed in a yeomanly manner, otherwise Robin would have never accosted him. It was not until Robin heard the Potter speak that he recognizes him as a yeoman. Whether he was referring to his direct straightforward manner, or his dialect, or both, is unclear to a 21st-century reader. But it is apparent that the original 15th century audiences knew exactly what &quot;good yeomanry&quot; was.

=== Yeoman archer (14th–15th centuries) ===
The Yeoman Archer is a term applied specifically to English and Welsh military longbow archers (either mounted or on foot) of the 14th–15th centuries. Yeoman archers were commoners; free-born members of the social classes below the nobility and gentry. They were a product of the English form of feudalism in which the military duty of a knight to his lord (which was implicit in tenure feudalism) was replaced by paid, short-term service.

The Yeoman Archers were the English Army&#x27;s response to a chronic manpower problem when trying to field an army on the European continent during the 14th century. Against 27,000 French knights, England could only muster at most 5,000 men-at-arms. With this 5:1 tactical disadvantage, the English needed a strategic advantage.

When Edward I invaded Wales in 1282, he quickly realized the battlefield importance of the opposing Welsh archers. Firing from ambush, they inflicted serious casualties on Edward&#x27;s army. When Edward invaded Scotland for the second time in 1298, his army consisted mostly of infantry (12,500 of 15,000 men). His infantry included about 10,500–10,900 Welshmen. 2,000 men, including archers, were raised as part of the Lancashire and Cheshire levies under the Commission of Array. At the Battle of Falkirk, the English army archers opened up the Scottish schiltrons with hails of arrows. The Scottish infantrymen fled the battlefield, to be pursued and killed by the English cavalry. In 1333, his grandson, Edward III, undertook his first invasion of Scotland, which culminated with the Battle of Halidon Hill. Halidon Hill is where the 20-year old Edward III learned how to combine archers and dismounted men-at-arms – tactics that he would employ during his Crécy campaign in France. The English victory at the Battle of Crécy was followed by another victory at the Battle of Poitiers, and a final victory at the Siege of Calais. After the Battle of Agincourt, the Yeoman Archer had become as legendary as his bow. By negating the tactical advantage of large numbers of cavalry (mounted knights and men-at-arms) with their ability to rapidly fire volleys of arrows, Yeoman Archers are considered part of the Infantry revolution of the 14th century. They could be deployed as &quot;Archers on horse&quot; (mounted archers who could reach the scene quickly, dismount, &amp; set up a firing line) or as &quot;Archers on foot&quot; (foot archers who followed as reinforcements).

===Yeoman of the Guard (15th century-present)===


On 22 August 1485, near the small village of Stoke Golding, Henry Tudor met King Richard III in battle for the Crown of England. The War of the Roses had persisted intermittently for more than 30 years between the rival claimants of the House of York (white rose) and the House of Lancaster (red rose). In 1483, Richard, of the House of York, had deposed his young nephew, 12-year old Edward V. Henry Tudor, of the House of Lancaster, was the favored candidate to replace Richard.

Three armies met that day on Bosworth Field: Richard, with his supporters, Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Northumberland; Henry, with his troops under command of the veteran John de Vere, Earl of Oxford; and the troops of Thomas, Lord Stanley. Stanley was a powerful lord in northwest England. But he was stepfather of Henry Tudor, and Richard was holding his son hostage. Stanley&#x27;s forces remained uncommitted as the battle raged. As Oxford advanced, the troops appeared to leave Henry, his bodyguards, and some French mercenaries isolated. Or so it appeared to Richard. Sensing an opportunity, Richard charged toward Henry. Seeing this, Stanley made his decision, and charged to reinforce Henry. Henry&#x27;s bodyguards fought bravely to hold off Richard&#x27;s bodyguards until the arrival of Stanley&#x27;s troops. During the melee, Richard&#x27;s horse became mired in the marsh, and he was killed. Henry had won.

Henry rewarded his bodyguards by formal establishing the &quot;Yeomen of the Guard of (the body of) our Lord the King&quot;. The King of England always had bodyguards (&quot;Yeoman of the Crown&quot;). This royal act recognized their bravery and loyalty in doing their duty, and designated them as the first members of a bodyguard to protect the King (or Queen) of England forever. In their first official act on 1 October 1485, fifty members of the Yeoman of the Guard, led by John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, formally escorted Henry Tudor to his coronation ceremony.

=== Yeoman Warder (16th century-present) ===

The Tower of London was used as permanent royal residence until 1509–10, during the reign of King Henry VIII. Henry ordered 12 Yeoman of the Guard to remain as a garrison, indicating that the Tower was still a royal palace. When the Tower no longer served that function, the garrison became warders, and were not permitted to wear the Yeoman of the Guard uniform. During the reign of Henry&#x27;s son, Edward VI, the warders were given back the uniform. This was done as a result of petition from the former Lord Protector of the Realm, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. Seymour, who was Edward&#x27;s uncle, had been confined there, and found the warders to be most considerate.

=== English Navy yeoman (to 1485) ===

The earliest documented use of yeoman relative to a navy is found in the &quot;Merchant&#x27;s Tale of Beryn&quot;: &quot;Why gone the yeomen to boat – Anchors to haul?&quot; The context of the quotation sheds no further light on either yeomen or boats. What is important is the date of the manuscript: between 1450 and 1470. This places the &quot;Merchant&#x27;s Tale of Beryn&quot; about the same time as the &quot;Robin Hood and the Monk&quot; manuscript, and shortly before the end of the Hundred Years War. To understand the connections between yeoman and the early English navy, it is necessary to examine King Edward III&#x27;s reign and the beginning of the Hundred Years War.

England did not have a standing navy until the Tudor Navy of King Henry VIII. Before then, the &quot;King&#x27;s Ships&quot; were a very small fleet allocated for the King&#x27;s personal use. During the Hundred Years War, King Edward III actually owned only a few ships. The rest were made available to the King through agreements with his nobles and the various port towns of England. About 25 ships of various sizes were made available to Edward III every year. They ranged from the small Thames sailing barges (descended from the famous Norman longships of the Bayeux Tapestry) which shuttled the royal retinue up and down the River Thames, to large cogs. Cogs were large merchant ships, with high prows and sterns, and a single mast with a single square sail. The largest cogs were built to carry sizable wine casks. The Vintners&#x27; Company, in return for their monopoly on the wine trade, had to make their cogs available to the King on demand.

The 1345 &quot;Household Ordinance of Edward III&quot; provides a brief summary of the Fleets organized for the Crécy campaign. The South Fleet (which included all English ports south and west of River Thames) consisted of 493 ships with 9,630 mariners. Of these, the &quot;King&#x27;s Ships&quot; (25 ships with 419 mariners), the ports of Dartmouth (31 ships with 757 mariners), Plymouth (26 ships with 603 mariners), and London (25 ships with 602 mariners) were the largest contingents. The North Fleet (which included all English ports north of River Thames) consisted of 217 ships with 4521 mariners. The port of Yarmouth, with 43 ships with 1095 mariners, was the largest contingent. The definition of a mariner is unclear, as is the difference between a mariner and a sailor. The number of mariners given is about twice that needed to man a ship. Edward&#x27;s warships carried two crews. The second crew was used for night sailing, for providing a crew for prize ships, and for providing more fighting men.
Early in the Hundred Years War, the largest existing merchant ships, such as the cog, were converted to warships with the addition of wooden castles. There were three types of castles: forecastle (at the prow), aftcastle (at the stern), and the topcastle (at the top of the mast). A record from 1335 tells of the vessel &quot;Trinity&quot; (200 tons) being converted for war. As new ships were built, the castles became integral with the ship&#x27;s hull.

As the King was impressing all the big ships and their crews for the war effort, the mayors and merchants of the port towns were retrofitting old ships and building new ones for harbor defense, and patrols to protect coastal ships and fishing boats from enemy ships and pirates.

By this time (mid-14th century), the Captain of the ship was a separate military rank. He was responsible for the defense of the ship. For every 4 mariners aboard the warship, there was 1 man-at-arms and 1 archer who was stationed in the castles. For a vessel the size of the &quot;Trinity&quot;, which carried about 130 mariners, there were at least 32 men-at-arms and 32 archers.

These illuminations from a 14th-century manuscript provide some insight as to how the retrofitted castles were used in battle. The first illustration shows a 2-masted vessel, with a man-at-arms in the retrofitted aftcastle, and an archer in the retrofitted topcastle.

The next illustration shows a battle scene. The tactics included using grappling hooks to position the ships so that the archers on the aftcastles had clear shots into the opposing ship. After raking the deck with arrows, the men-at-arms would swing over to finish the job.

The warship Captain was also responsible for convoying 30 merchant vessels from English ports to the French shore. These vessels carried the troops, horses, food, forage, and whatever else was needed upon landing in France.

The Master (or Master Mariner) was responsible for sailing the vessel. Under him were the Constables (equivalent to today&#x27;s boatswains). One constable oversaw twenty crewmen. Collecting a crew was traditionally the task of the Master. However, with the need for double-crews, the King authorized his Admirals to offer the King&#x27;s pardon to outlaws and pirates. In 1342, the number of men who responded exceeded the demand. Edward&#x27;s deputies never had trouble again raising the crews they needed. This is reminiscent of the pardons offered by Edward to outlaws of the Robin Hood ballads. Therefore, it is possible that the real answer to &quot;Why gone the yeomen to boat – Anchors to haul?&quot; was a pardon.

Instances of yeoman in a naval context are rare before 1700. In 1509, the Office of Ordnance had a Master, Clerk, and Yeoman. In 1608, a House of Lords manuscript mentions a ship&#x27;s gunner and a yeoman. Then in 1669 appeared &quot;The Mariner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, dedicated to the Society of Merchant-Adventurers of the City of Bristol. Among the various chapters on the use of mathematics in sea navigation and gunnery, the author suggests &quot;He [the Gunner] must be careful in making Choice of a sober honest Man, for the Yeoman of the Powder.&quot;(modern spelling) In 1702, actual titles of seamen appear in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;: Yeomen of the Sheets, and Yeomen of the Powder Room.

=== Social stratum of small freeholders ===

This review of the yeoman freeholders is divided into three periods: (a) up to 1500; (b) between 1500 and 1600; and (c) between 1600 and 1800. This division corresponds roughly to the historical changes experienced by the freeholders themselves, as well as the shifting contemporary social hierarchies in which they lived. It is also influenced by the availability of sources for each period.

==== Up to 1500 ====

The parliament of 1327 was a watershed event. For the first time since the Norman Conquest, an English king was disposed peaceably, and not usurped by military means. Although Edward II had been previously threatened with deposition in 1310 and 1321, all those who attended the parliament of 1327 were aware of the constitutional crisis. The king was imprisoned by his Queen Isabella and her paramour Roger Mortimer after their invasion of England. The Parliament was a legal pretense to confer legitimacy upon their actions. The Lords Temporal and the Lords Spiritual were summoned in the King&#x27;s name, while the Knights of the Shire, Burgesses from the towns, and representatives from the Cinque Ports were elected to attend. (Note 13: Richardson and Sayles 1930 p 44–45) According to Michael Prestwich: &quot;What was necessary was to ensure that every conceivable means of removing the King was adopted, and the procedures combined all possible precedents&quot;. Hence, establishing the legitimacy of Edward III was paramount. But it was the Knights of the Shire and Burgesses (hereafter referred to as &quot;the commons&quot;) who drove the proceedings, both before and after Edward III&#x27;s coronation. Beginning in 1327, the commons became a permanent part of parliament.
In the 14th century, the name commons did not have its modern meaning of &quot;common people&quot;. It referred to &quot;the communities&quot;, which was &quot;les Communs&quot; in Anglo-Norman French. The word meant that those elected to the parliament were representatives of their communities, that is, the shires and the urban areas. To distinguish between this early assembly from the later House of Commons, &quot;the commons&quot; is used herein.
The commons included the proctors of the lesser clergy as members of the sessions. In 1333, the commons sat together in a single chamber for the first time. About this same time, the commons was evolving into its role of legislating taxation. The king preferred to include taxes on clerical income with the direct taxes on the laity. The church hierarchy (archbishops and bishops) considered that no secular authority had the right to enforce tax collection from clerical income in a secular court. Such cases, they thought, should be considered in an of law. In 1340, the bishops negotiated a settlement with the Crown, wherein disputes between the king and clergy over taxation would be heard in ecclesiastical courts at either Canterbury or York. Therefore, there was no longer a need for the proctors to attend the commons. This was an important milestone for the commons. It became a secular assembly, its deliberations unaffected by ecclesiastical concerns. In 1342, the commons reorganized itself as the House of Commons, deliberating separately from the king, nobles and higher clergy of noble status. Each county had two Knights of the Shire as representatives, except for Durham and Cheshire, which were county palatines.

Initially, the Knights of the Shire were selected from among the belted knights.
Sir Anthony Richard Wagner, Garter Principal King of Arms, wrote that &quot;a Yeoman would not normally have less than 100 acres&quot; (40 hectares) &quot;and in social status is one step down from the Landed gentry, but above, say, a husbandman&quot;. Often it was hard to distinguish minor landed gentry from the wealthier yeomen, and wealthier husbandmen from the poorer yeomen.

==== 1500–1600 ====
* As some yeomen overlapped into the newly emerging gentry through wealth and marriage; others merged with the merchants and professions of the towns through education; some became local officials in the counties; and still others maintained their original identity as farmers.
* Yeomen were often constables of their parish, and sometimes chief constables of the district, shire or hundred. Many yeomen held the positions of bailiffs for the High Sheriff or for the shire or hundred. Other civic duties would include churchwarden, bridge warden, and other warden duties. It was also common for a yeoman to be an overseer for his parish. Yeomen, whether working for a lord, king, shire, knight, district or parish, served in localised or municipal police forces raised by or led by the landed gentry. Some of these roles, in particular those of constable and bailiff, were carried down through families. Yeomen often filled ranging, roaming, surveying, and policing roles. In districts remoter from landed gentry and burgesses, yeomen held more official power: this is attested in statutes of the reign of Henry VIII (reigned 1509–1547), indicating yeomen along with knights and squires as leaders for certain purposes.

=== Yeoman farmer ===
* In the United States, yeomen were identified in the 18th and 19th centuries as non-slaveholding, small landowning, family farmers. In areas of the Southern United States where land was poor, like East Tennessee, the landowning yeomen were typically subsistence farmers, but some managed to grow crops for market. Whether they engaged in subsistence or commercial agriculture, they controlled far more modest landholdings than those of the planters, typically in the range of 50–200 acres. In the Northern United States, practically all the farms were operated by yeoman farmers as family farms.
* Thomas Jefferson was a leading advocate of the yeomen, arguing that the independent farmers formed the basis of republican values. Indeed, Jeffersonian Democracy as a political force was largely built around the yeomen. After the American Civil War (1861–1865), organizations of farmers, especially the Grange, formed to organize and enhance the status of the yeoman farmers.

=== The Yeomanry ===

During the 1790s, the threat of French invasion of Great Britain appeared genuine. In 1794, The British Volunteer Corps was organized for home defense, composed of local companies of part-time volunteers. Their cavalry troops became known as the Yeomanry Cavalry. The infantry companies were disbanded by 1813, as the threat of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s invasion evaporated. However, the Yeomanry Cavalry was retained. They were used to quell the food riots of 1794–95 and break up workers&#x27; strikes during the 1820s–1840s, as part of their mandate was to maintain the King&#x27;s Peace. The rise of civilian police forces during this same period (the Metropolitan Police Act 1829, the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and the County Police Act 1839) replaced the Yeomanry Cavalry as an instrument of law enforcement. In 1899, the Yeomanry Cavalry were deployed overseas during the Second Boer War, after a series of devastating British Army defeats. In 1901, the Yeomanry Cavalry formed the nucleus of the new Imperial Yeomanry. Eight years later, the Imperial Yeomanry and the Volunteer Force were combined as the Territorial Force.

=== United States Navy ===
In the modern Navy, a yeoman is an enlisted service member who performs administrative and clerical work.

The Continental Navy was established by the Continental Congress in 1775. The legislation called for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted men. The roster of enlisted men was left open to each ship captain to fill as he deemed necessary. After the Treaty of Paris, the Navy was considered unnecessary by Congress, and it was disbanded in 1785. The surviving ships were sold off.

The US Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 14) granted the new US Congress the power to build and maintain a navy. It wasn&#x27;t until 1794, when the worsening US relations with Great Britain and France, as well as the continuing attacks by Barbary pirates, forced Congress to appropriate funds to construct 6 frigates. The US naval hierarchy established followed the precedent set by the British Royal Navy. To which the US Navy added Petty Officers, which included the jobs traditionally assigned to naval yeomen. The first US Navy yeomen were &quot;Yeoman of the Gunroom&quot; and the &quot;Captain&#x27;s Clerk&quot;. Petty officers were appointed by the ship&#x27;s captain, and served at his pleasure. They did not retain their rank when they moved to another ship.

As the US Navy transformed from sail to steam, and from wood to steel, the yeoman&#x27;s duties gradually changed to more administrative tasks. The &quot;Gunner&#x27;s Yeoman&quot; was eliminated in 1838, the &quot;Boatswain&#x27;s Yeoman&quot; in 1864, the &quot;Engineer&#x27;s Yeoman&quot; and the &quot;Equipment Yeoman&quot; in 1893. The &quot;Captain&#x27;s Clerk&quot; of 1798 became a Yeoman in 1893. Which makes today&#x27;s Yeoman a descendant of one of the original rates and ratings in the US Navy.

== Late Middle/Early Modern English literature ==

Until the 16th century, yeomen were mentioned either as servants in Norman French-speaking aristocratic households, or as members of the English army or navy in the Anglo-Norman kings&#x27; military expeditions across the English Channel. It was not until Middle English became England&#x27;s official language during the 14th century and the new social stratum of yeoman freeholders gained respectability during the 15th century, that the oral ballads repeated by previous generations of English-speaking yeomen were written down and distributed to a wider audience.

The best-known ballads were about the yeoman outlaw Robyn Hode (Robin Hood, in modern spelling). A J Pollard, in his book &quot;Imagining Robin Hood: The Late Medieval Stories in Historical Context&quot;, proposed that the first Robin Hood was a literary fiction of the 15th and early 16th centuries. This does not mean that Pollard claims that Robin Hood was &quot;not&quot; historical. He considers that what modern popular culture &quot;thinks&quot; it knows about Robin is actually based upon how previous generations over the last 500 years have viewed him. The historical Robyn Hode was (or were, in the case of there possibly being several men whose exploits were melded into the single individual of the ballads) is of secondary importance to his cultural symbolism for succeeding generations. In his review of Pollard&#x27;s book, Thomas Ohlgren, one of the editors of the University of Rochester&#x27;s &quot;The Robin Hood Project&quot;, agreed with this assessment. Because &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot; is a 16th-century collective memory of a fictional past, it can also be seen as a reflection of the century in which it was written. Following in the footsteps of Pollard and Ohlgren, this section examines some of the literature written in Late Middle English and Early Modern English to explore how the historical Yeoman was slowly transformed by succeeding generations into a legend for their own times.

=== &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot; ===


Rhymes (ballads) of Robin Hood were being sung as early as the 1370s. William Langland, the author of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, has Sloth say that he does not know his &quot;Pater Noster&quot; (Latin for the &quot;Our Father&quot; prayer) as perfectly as the priest sings it, but he does know the rhymes of Robin Hood. Unfortunately, the rhymes that William Langland heard have not survived. The earliest surviving ballads are &quot;Robin Hood and the Monk&quot; (dated to 1450), &quot;Robin Hood and the Potter&quot; (dated to about 1500), and &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot;.
The oldest copies of &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot; are print editions dated between 1510 and 1530. These early rhymes are witnesses to a crucial time in English history. The 14th–15th centuries saw the rise of the common people&#x27;s Middle English over the decline of the aristocrats&#x27; Norman French, the military prowess of the yeoman longbowmen during the Hundred Years War (see Yeoman Archers), and the beginnings of a yeoman class (see Social Class of Small Freeholders).
In the &quot;Gest&quot;, Robin is an outlaw (meaning &quot;outside the law&quot;); someone who was summoned to a law court, but failed to appear. He has gathered around himself a fellowship of &quot;sevenscore men&quot;, that is, 140 skilled bowmen. Nevertheless, Robin is the King&#x27;s Man: &quot;I love no man in all the world/So well as I do my king;&quot;. Disguised as a monk carrying the King&#x27;s Seal, King Edward finally meets Robin, and is invited to a feast. During the archery contest afterwards, Robin suddenly recognizes Edward. He immediately kneels to offer homage, asking for mercy for his men. Edward grants pardon, and invites Robin to court. Robin agrees, and offers his men as a retinue. Note how Robin&#x27;s behavior fits a commander of men. This entire scene is reminiscent of the contracted indenture offered by Edward III, where pardons were granted for war service (see Yeoman Archers). It is interesting that this historical detail had been preserved in the &quot;Gest of Robyn Hode&quot;.
These earliest ballads contain clues to the changes in the English social structure which elevated the yeoman to a more powerful and influential level (see A Chivalric Rank). In the box to the left is the opening of &quot;Robin Hood and the Potter&quot;. (Note that all quotations have modern spelling, and obsolete words have been substituted.) The audience is addressed as &quot;good yeomen&quot;, and yeoman Robin is described as possessing the &quot;knightly virtues&quot; of courtesy (good manners), goodness, generosity, and a devotion to the Virgin Mary. Thomas Ohlgren, a Robin Hood scholar, considers this to be an indication of the social changes the yeomen were undergoing. The yeomen may be lower in social rank to the knight, but they see themselves as possessing the traits of the knightly class.
In the box to the right, the opening lines of &quot;Gest of Robyn Hode&quot; offer confirmation that yeomen now consider themselves as part of the gentry. The audience is now composed of &quot;gentlemen&quot;. Stephen Knight and Thomas Ohlgren suggest that the &quot;Gest&quot; audience was a literate audience interested in political resistance. This interpretation appears to be supported by the rise of the new social class of yeoman (see Social Class of Small Freeholders).

=== Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; ===
Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s The Canterbury Tales include several characters described as yeoman, shedding light on the nature of the yeoman in the late 14th century when the work was written.

==== General Prologue: The Yeoman ====

In the &quot;General Prologue&quot;, Chaucer describes The Yeoman as being the only servant The Knight wanted on the pilgrimage. From the way he was dressed, Chaucer supposes he is a forester. The man is wearing a green tunic and hood. His hair is closely cropped, his face is tanned and weather-beaten, and his horn is slung from a green baldric. The Yeoman is well-armed. He carries a &quot;mighty bow&quot; in his hand with a sheaf of arrows hung from his belt. Chaucer points out that the peacock feather fletching was well-made. The archer obviously took great care when making his arrows. He also carries a sword, a buckler, and a small dagger. (Note the similarity between this yeoman&#x27;s accoutrements and those of the &quot;Yeomen of the King&#x27;s Crown&quot;.) The forester&#x27;s final protection is a medal of Saint Christopher, the patron saint of travelers.

Chaucer&#x27;s description of a forester is based upon his experiences as a deputy forester of North Petherton Park in Somersetshire.

The very first line of The Yeoman&#x27;s description is the statement the Knight wanted no other servant. Kenneth J Thompson quoted Earle Birney as saying that a forester was the only attendant the Knight needed; he was a &quot;huntsman-forester, knight&#x27;s bodyguard, squire&#x27;s attendant, lord&#x27;s retainer, king&#x27;s foot-soldier&quot;. The forester&#x27;s job was to protect the &quot;vert and venison&quot; – the deer and the Royal forest they inhabited. The foresters not only discouraged poaching, but provided winter feed, and cared for newly born calves. The medieval English foresters also provided basic woodland management by preventing unauthorized grazing, and illegal logging. Another function of the forester was assist the King&#x27;s Huntsmen in planning the royal hunts. The foresters knew the game animals, and where to find them.

When his lord was campaigning in wartime, the forester was capable of providing additional meat for the lord&#x27;s table. During the 1358–60 campaign in France, Edward III had 30 falconers on horseback, and 60 couples (or pairs) of hounds.

The Yeoman has his &quot;mighty bow&quot; (most probably a longbow) at the ready, implying he is on duty serving as bodyguard against highwaymen and robbers. He carries a sheaf of arrows under his belt, which implies an arrow bag suspended from his belt.

Chaucer&#x27;s description of The Yeoman has been interpreted as an iconographic representation of the dutiful servant, diligent and always ready to serve. In other words, the very picture of yeoman service.

Thompson quotes an interesting excerpt from the Anonimalle Chronicle. It is part of the description of King John II&#x27;s journey to London, after he had been captured by the Black Prince at the Battle of Poitiers:

:&quot;On their way through England, the King of England aforesaid caused many lords and other people of the countryside to meet them, in a forest, dressed in coats and mantles of green. And when the said King of France passed through the said forest, the said men showed themselves in front of the King of France and his company, like robbers or malefactors with bows and arrows and with swords and bucklers; and the King of France marveled greatly at the sight, asking what manner of men these were. And the prince answered that these were men of England, forest-dweller, living as they pleased in the wild; and it was their custom to be arrayed thus every day.&quot;

The encounter was obviously some political posturing staged by Edward III for the benefit of the French king. It displayed the opposition the French army would face should the King decide to invade England.

==== The Friar&#x27;s Tale ====
In the tale told by the Friar, the devil assumes the disguise of a yeoman dressed in a green tunic, a hat with black fringes, and carrying a bow and some arrows. The devil meets a summoner on his rounds. The tale continues as a scathing condemnation of the vile corruption of the summoner, whom the devil eventually takes to hell:
:&quot;And with that word this foul fiend seized him;
:Body and soul he with the devil went
:Where summoners have their heritage.&quot;

==== The Canon&#x27;s Yeoman&#x27;s Prologue ====


Chaucer constructed this tale quite differently than the other ones. The Canon and his Yeoman are not part of the original party. They are introduced when the group reaches Boughton under Blean, only 5 miles from Canterbury. From the top of Boughton Hill, those traveling along the Pilgrim&#x27;s Way from London can see the towers of Canterbury Cathedral for the first time. This close proximity to Canterbury makes the entrance of the Canon and his Yeoman suspicious. Even more suspicious is the sudden exit of the Canon, leaving his Yeoman to tell the tale himself.

Two Chaucerian scholars have different but complementary interpretations, and neither concern a satire on alchemy. Albert E Hartung proposes that the &quot;Canon&#x27;s Yeoman&#x27;s Prologue&quot; is a device to include a previously written story into &quot;the Canterbury Tales&quot; as the &quot;Pars Secunda&quot;. Jackson J. Campbell proposes the interruption of the pilgrims&#x27; journey by the Canon and his yeoman so near to Canterbury is a device to prepare for the Parson&#x27;s Tale, which is actually a sermon. Both interpretations place importance on the characterization of the Yeoman.

Hartung proposes that the real reason the Canon rode so fast and so hard to join the pilgrims is that he was seeking new victims. The Yeoman urges that it would be to the pilgrims&#x27; advantage to know the Canon better; that he is a remarkable man. The Canon knows the secret of turning the road they are traveling upside down, and repaving it with silver and gold. When The Host asks why The Canon is dressed in dirty rags, when he can afford clothes of the finest material, the Yeoman deftly replies that the Canon will never prosper, because his faith will not allow him to enrich himself though his knowledge.

The impression that it was time for the Canon and his Yeoman to move on is reinforced by the Yeoman&#x27;s description of where they lived:
:&quot;In the outskirts of a town,&quot; said he,
:&quot;Lurking in hiding places and in dead-end alleys,
:Where these robbers and these thieves by nature
:Hold their private fearful residence, ...&quot; (lines 657–660)
At this point the Canon reins his horse in beside his Yeoman, demanding that he not reveal any secrets. The Host dismisses the Canon&#x27;s threats as mere bluster, and the Canon gallops away. The Yeoman&#x27;s reaction implies that he may have hoped that this would happen. It was the Yeoman who noticed the Pilgrims leaving the hostelry that morning, and informed the Canon.

At this point, at the beginning of the &quot;Prima Pars&quot; (&quot;First Part&quot;), Campbell draws attention to the Yeoman&#x27;s manner of speaking. He notes that the Yeoman rambles on impulsively in an unorganized fashion. His speech is full of free association and stream of consciousness.(p 174, 176) Seeing the Canon ride off unleashes a torrent of inventive against the Canon – and against himself. He sorrowfully remembers when his face was fresh and ruddy; now it is the color of lead. He used to wear fine clothing and have &quot;splendid furnishings&quot;, now he wears a legging on his head. When their experiments failed to convert one gold coin into two, he borrowed the gold to pay the customer. Campbell describes the self-revulsion felt by the Yeoman for the futility of alchemy, and the deception and dishonesty employed while searching for the philosopher&#x27;s stone. He hates it, but is fascinated by it at the same time.

Hartung agrees that Chaucer is presenting the pursuit of the philosopher&#x27;s stone as an affliction He contrasts the Yeoman&#x27;s Canon in the &quot;Prima Parta&quot; with the charlatan alchemist in the &quot;Pars Secunda&quot; (&quot;Second Part&quot;) of the &quot;Yeoman&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Huntung proposes that this part of the Tale was composed for an audience of clergymen. The alchemist is compared with the devil, and the &quot;worshipful canons&quot; who pursue the study of alchemy are no better than Judas, who betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver. But the tirade is not against alchemy itself.

The penitent Yeoman reinforces the overall theme of pilgrimage, with its emphasis on repentance, and forgiveness. Chaucer is preparing the reader (or listener) for the &quot;Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which a sermon about penitence, &quot;which can not fail to man nor to woman who through sin has gone astray from the right way to Jerusalem celestial&quot;.

=== Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; ===
The initial performance of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry V&quot; was in 1599. The focus of the play was the Battle of Agincourt, which had occurred 184 years before. It is a rousing patriotic play, but it was also propaganda. Elizabeth I sat upon a shaky throne. The Catholic threat from Spain and at home, war with Spain, concern over who she would marry, concern over the succession.
The Nine Years War was underway. The English army had suffered defeat by the Irish at the Battle of the Yellow Ford in 1598. Elizabeth and her counsellors were preparing an invasion in 1599. However, her Privy Council was no longer composed of her most trusted advisors. Most of them – Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, Sir Francis Walsingham, and Sir Christopher Hatton had died by 1591. William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley died in 1598. The council was split between Robert Cecil (Burghley&#x27;s son) and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, who were locked in a bitter rivalry.

In 1599, Elizabeth was 66 years old, and her personal power was waning. She could not prevent the execution of her personal physician, Roderigo Lopez on a false charge of treason brought by the Earl of Essex. In spite of his irresponsibility, the Earl of Essex was appointed Lord Lord Lieutenant, and given command of the 16,000-man Irish invasion force.

Shakespeare wrote &quot;Henry V&quot; to rally support for the Ireland invasion. The play followed naturally after his &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, written between 1576 and 1599. Henry&#x27;s victory at Agincourt in spite of overwhelming odds was the perfect plot. Shakespeare presented Henry&#x27;s invasion of France and his Agincourt victory in all its complexity. The play can be interpreted either as a celebration of Henry&#x27;s military skill, or as an examination of the moral and human cost of war.

In the famous rousing call to action in act 3, scene 1, Henry urges his yeomen to show the French what fine bowmen are raised in England. His yeomen are not &quot;mean and base&quot;, but possess a &quot;noble luster&quot; in their eyes. &quot;Unto the breach, dear friends, once more&quot;, he almost pleads. The yeomen have been besieging Harfleur for over a month; they are suffering from dysentery. &quot;Follow your spirit&quot; and charge, Henry commands.

But Shakespeare&#x27;s ultimate speech comes on 25 October in act 4, scene 3. Henry now calls his army a &quot;band of brothers&quot;. The camaraderie of combat has made gentlemen of them all. When they hear a veteran speak of what happened on St Crispin&#x27;s Day, &quot;gentlemen in England&quot; will be ashamed of being asleep in bed at the time such deeds were done.

== 19th century Romanticism ==
=== Sir Walter Scott ===
Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe: a Romance&quot; was published to an English audience that was experiencing a medieval revival. His notes show that he had read much of the medieval poetry and chronicles which were reprinted during the 17th and 18th centuries. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; was &quot;... an historical reconstruction of 12th century England in the spiritual image of the 19th.&quot; Scott&#x27;s highly detailed medieval setting attracts the interest of his reading audience; but his characters behave in a 19th-century manner in order to retain that interest. It was a device Scott employed to explore the struggle between good and evil in the guise of the struggle between the Anglo-Saxons and their Norman overlords shortly after the Conquest.
Scott invented The Captain/Locksley/Robin Hood (hereafter referred to as Locksley) by drawing from Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques&quot; (1765) and Joseph Ritson&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1795), which contained all that was known at the time about the heroic outlaw. However, Scott&#x27;s Locksley is closest to the yeoman depicted in A Gest of Robyn Hode. Simeone points out that Scott deliberately made Robin Hood a yeoman as well as an outcast in order to show that ordinary men, and not just the rich and powerful, have an important part to play in the making of a nation. Scott re-inforced his point by having Gurth and Wamba, thralls of Cedric, play pivotal roles as well. This was a new concept at the time, as it was during this period (1775–1779) that the American Revolution and the French Revolution occurred.

Scott refashioned the traditional hero of the Robin Hood ballads into an ancestral hero who would crush the misrule of evil men and restore the rightful rule of law.He demonstrates Locksley&#x27;s physical superiority with the victory in the archery contest at the Tournament of Ashby. Locksley&#x27;s ability to lead men in the field is displayed at the attack on Torquilstone castle. At the victory feast under the Tryst Tree, Locksley shares his high table with Cedric, the Saxon franklin, and the Norman Black Knight. His sense of justice supports the democratic system set up by the outlaws concerning the division of the spoils. Locksley&#x27;s insistence on the Black Knight taking the horn as protection against Prince John&#x27;s evil henchman Fitzurse demonstrates that he bows to the lawful authority of the King. In turn, the King himself bows to the noble spirit of the Yeoman:

=== Howard Pyle ===
Howard Pyle&#x27;s contribution to the Robin Hood revival of the 19th century was his richly illustrated children&#x27;s book &quot;The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. Pyle is the author who first portrayed Robin as a kind-hearted outlaw who &quot;robs from the rich to give to the poor&quot;. Each chapter covered one of the Robin Hood tales and the chapter sequence was arranged to present a coherent narrative. The resulting storyline was reused in early films such as &quot;Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood&quot; and Errol Flynn&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;.
Pyle&#x27;s visual and verbal depiction of the outlaw yeoman Robin Hood has become a 20th-century popular culture icon. Any resemblance to the yeoman of Gest, or with any possible historical persons who may have inspired the 15th–16th century ballads, is strictly coincidental. Pyle&#x27;s storyline has been adapted to appeal to 20th century film audiences as a romanticized rousing action-adventure.

<text>The University of Caen Normandy (French: &quot;Université de Caen Normandie&quot;), also known as Unicaen, is a public university in Caen, France.

==History==

The institution was founded in 1432 by John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, the first rector being a Cornishman, Michael Tregury, afterwards Archbishop of Dublin. It originally consisted of a faculty of Canon Law and a faculty of Law. By 1438, it already had five faculties. The foundation was confirmed by the King of France Charles VII the Victorious in 1452.

On 7 July 1944 the university was completely destroyed by aerial bombing during Operation Charnwood, an action of the Battle of Caen. Between 1944 and 1954, the university was based in the buildings of the regional teachers’ college. A new campus was designed by Henry Bernard and constructed between 1948 and 1957. The new university was inaugurated on 1 and 2 June 1957. Its logo, the mythical Phoenix, symbolises this revival.

<text>Abetalipoproteinemia (also known as: Bassen–Kornzweig syndrome, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein deficiency disease, MTP deficiency, and betalipoprotein deficiency syndrome) is a disorder characterized by abnormal absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins from food. It is caused by a mutation in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein resulting in deficiencies in the apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100, which are used in the synthesis and exportation of chylomicrons and VLDL respectively. It is not to be confused with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.

It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder.

== Presentation ==

===Symptoms===
Initial symptoms usually appear in infancy, including:
* Failure to thrive (i.e. failure to grow in infancy)
* Steatorrhea (i.e. fatty, pale stools)
* Frothy stools
* Foul smelling stools
* Protruding abdomen

The rate of occurrence of additional symptoms later in life varies and increases with age. These may include:
* Intellectual disability/developmental delay
* Ataxia (problems with balance and movement)
* Muscle weakness
* Slurred speech (dysarthria)
* Lordosis (curved lower back) and kyphoscoliosis (curved upper back)
* Progressive decreased vision
* Reflex and proprioception problems

===Signs===
* Acanthocytosis
* Retinitis pigmentosa
* Low blood cholesterol

===Features===
Abetalipoproteinemia affects the absorption of dietary fats, cholesterol, and certain vitamins. People affected by this disorder are not able to make certain lipoproteins, which are molecules that consist of proteins combined with cholesterol and particular fats called triglycerides. This leads to a multiple vitamin deficiency, affecting the fat-soluble vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K. However, many of the observed effects are due to vitamin E deficiency in particular.
Signs and symptoms vary and present differently from person to person. In general, 80–99% of individuals exhibit malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Approximately 30–79% of people with the disease display symptoms related to abnormality of the retinal pigmentation, ataxia, muscular hypotonia or reduced tendon reflexes.

The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia appear in the first few months of life (because pancreatic lipase is not active in this period). They can include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); diarrhea; abnormal spiny red blood cells (acanthocytosis); and fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea). The stool may contain large chunks of fat and/or blood. Infants often present with gastrointestinal problems caused by the poor fat absorption, which also contributes to steatorrhea. Other features of this disorder may develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system. They can include poor muscle coordination, difficulty with balance and movement (ataxia), and progressive degeneration of the retina (the light-sensitive layer in the posterior eye) that can progress to near-blindness (due to deficiency of vitamin A, retinol). Adults in their thirties or forties may have increasing difficulty with balance and walking. Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe vitamin deficiency, especially vitamin E deficiency, which typically results in eye problems with degeneration of the spinocerebellar and dorsal column tracts.

==Genetics==

Mutations in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene (&quot;MTTP&quot;) have been associated with this condition (apolipoprotein B deficiency, a related condition, is associated with deficiencies of apolipoprotein B).

The &quot;MTTP&quot; gene provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which is essential for creating beta-lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are both necessary for the absorption of fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet and necessary for the efficient transport of these substances in the bloodstream. Most of the mutations in this gene lead to the production of an abnormally short microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which prevents the normal creation of beta-lipoproteins in the body. MTTP-associated mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene must be faulty to produce the disease.

The disease is extremely rare with approximately 100 reported cases worldwide since it was first identified by doctors Bassen and Kornzweig in 1950.

== Mechanism ==
Abetalipoproteinemia effects multiple physiological systems, the two most common being the nervous and the skeletal. Disruption of nervous function includes loss of reflexes, speech impairments, tremors or involuntary motor tics, or peripheral neuropathy (damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord). Peripheral neuropathy causes loss of sensation, weakness or numbness and pain in the extremities through stabbing, burning, or tingling sensations. Skeletal system developments often include lordosis, kyphoscoliosis, or pes cavus. Individuals often have abnormal bleeding due to the difficulty of forming clots.

Additional complications of the diseases if not properly treated include blindness, mental deterioration, ataxia, loss of peripheral nerve function.

==Diagnosis==
The initial workup of Abetalipoproteinemia typically consists of stool sampling, a peripheral blood smear, and a fasting lipid panel, though these tests are not confirmatory. As the disease is rare, though a genetics test is necessary for diagnosis, it is generally not done initially. However, prenatal testing may be available for pregnancies identified to be at an increased risk (if both parents are unaffected carrier or one parent is affected and the other in a carrier).{}

Acanthocytes are seen on blood smear. Since there is no or little assimilation of chylomicrons, their levels in plasma remains low.

The inability to absorb fat in the ileum will result in steatorrhea, or fat in the stool. As a result, this can be clinically diagnosed when foul-smelling stool is encountered. Low levels of plasma chylomicron are also characteristic.

There is an absence of apolipoprotein B. On intestinal biopsy, vacuoles containing lipids are seen in enterocytes. This disorder may also result in fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). Because the epithelial cells of the bowel lack the ability to place fats into chylomicrons, lipids accumulate at the surface of the cell, crowding the functions that are necessary for proper absorption.

Multiple related disorders present with similar symptoms as abetalipoproteinemia that can provide a useful diagnosis through comparisons. Some of those disorders are:

== Treatment ==

Treatment normally consists of rigorous dieting, involving massive amounts of vitamin E. High-dose Vitamin E therapy helps the body restore and produce lipoproteins, which people with abetalipoproteinemia usually lack. Vitamin E also helps keep skin and eyes healthy; studies show that many affected males will have vision problems later on in life. Common additional supplementation includes medium chain fatty acids and linoleic acid. Treatments also aim to slow the progression of nervous system abnormalities. Developmental coordination disorder and muscle weakness are usually treated with physiotherapy or occupational therapy. Dietary restriction of triglycerides has also been useful. Nutritionists often work with medical professionals to design appropriate dietary treatments for their patients.

== Prognosis ==
Prognosis can vary heavily based on the severity of the neurological dysfunction. If treatment is initiated early in disease the neurologic sequelae may be reversed and further deterioration can be prevented. Long-term outlook is reasonably good for most people when diagnosed and treated early. A case study presented a female patient diagnosed at the age of 11. Despite the relatively late diagnosis, the patient married and at the age of 34, gave birth to a full-term healthy infant. Her medication included vitamin K 10 mg twice a week, beta-carotene 40,000 IU daily, vitamin A 10,000 IU daily, vitamin E 400 IU daily, vitamins B6 and B12, calcium, magnesium and eye drops.

Prolonged vitamin deficiencies can further compromise health. Specifically, a prolonged vitamin E deficiency can lead to the development of limiting ataxia and gait disturbances. Some individuals may develop retinal degeneration and blindness. If left untreated, the condition may lead to death.&#x27;

== Current research ==
A primary goal of abetalipoproteinemia research is to supply the fat-soluble vitamins the body lacks in the disease. Previous research considered the short-term use of intravenous infusion of vitamins A and E. The goal was to determine whether these infusions would delay or counteract the symptoms in patients. No results were posted.

More recent research has focused on different ways to supply the patient with vitamin E. In 2018, the &quot;Journal of Lipid Research&quot; published a study testing alternative forms of vitamin E absorption. Currently, vitamin E is most often supplemented in the fat-soluble form vitamin E acetate. Due to fat malabsorption, the intended supplementation is considerably compromised. Two different forms were tested: vitamin E tocofersolan and α-tocopherol acetate. The study concluded that plasma bioavailabilities were extremely low (2.8% and 3.1%, respectively). Additionally, plasma concentrations of tocopherol were not significantly different in patients.

This study provides new insight in vitamin E supplementation and suggests further research is needed with different forms of vitamin E as possible treatment options to abetalipoproteinemia.

Currently, there is a clinical study recruiting abetalipoproteinemia patients to study inherited retinal degenerative disease. There is also a second clinical study, currently under recruitment, to investigate the consequences of deficiencies in lipophilic nutrients in this disease, such as lutein and carotenes, on retinal macular function.

<text>The Basset Hound is a short-legged breed of dog in the hound family. The Basset is a scent hound that was originally bred for the purpose of hunting hare. Their sense of smell and ability to &quot;ground-scent&quot; is second only to the Bloodhound.

Basset Hounds are one of six recognized &quot;basset&quot;-type breeds in France. The name &quot;Basset&quot; is derived from the French word , meaning &#x27;low&#x27;, with the attenuating suffix &quot;-et&quot;—together meaning &#x27;rather low&#x27;. Basset Hounds are usually bicolours or tricolours of standard hound coloration.

==Description==
===Appearance===
Bassets are large, short, solid and long, with curved sabre tails held high over their long backs. An adult dog weighs between . This breed, relative to its size, is heavier-boned than any other.

This breed, like its ancestor the Bloodhound, has a hanging skin structure, which causes the face to tend to have a sad look; this, for many people, adds to the breed&#x27;s charm. The loose elastic skin around the neck is known as the dewlap.

The coat is short, generally black, white and tan tricolor or tan and white bicolor, but with many other possible colors. The EM allele produces a black mask on the face that may extend up around the eyes and onto the ears. This pattern is most easily seen on mahogany dogs, although any Basset color pattern may express the EM allele, except for &quot;red and white&quot; or &quot;lemon and white&quot; due to e/e.

===Temperament===
The Basset Hound is a friendly, outgoing, and playful dog, tolerant of children and other pets.

==Health==
===Osteochondrodysplasia===
The Basset Hound&#x27;s short stature is due to the genetic condition osteochondrodysplasia. Osteochondrodysplasia causes stunted growth and impacts movement. Affected dogs develop splayed hind limbs, enlarged joints, flattened rib cages, shortened and bent long bones, and deformed paws.

===Life expectancy===
The breed has a median life span of 10–12 years. A 2015 French study found a life expectancy of 10.3 years. A 2024 study in the UK found a life expectancy of 12.5 years compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

===Other health issues===

Basset Hounds are prone to yeast infections.

Leading causes of death in a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey were cancer (31%), old age (13%), gastric dilatation volvulus (11%), and cardiac (8%).

Information from veterinary data found the prevalence of glaucoma to be 5.44%, second highest in the study.

The Basset Hound is predisposed to gastric dilatation volvulus. One study found the odds ratio to be 5.9.

Basset Hound hereditary thrombopathy is an autosomally inherited platelet disorder characterised by a thrombasthenia defect in primary aggregation abnormality of clot retraction. Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa is defective although detectable.

The Basset Hound is prone to several skin conditions: allergic skin disease; intertrigo; Malassezia dermatitis; and otitis, primary keratinization defects.

The Basset Hound is one of the more commonly affected breeds for primary open angle glaucoma. An autosomal recessive mutation of the ADAMTS17 gene is responsible for the condition in the breed.

==History==
===St Hubert&#x27;s Hound===
The Basset type originated in France, and is descended from the 6th-century hounds belonging to St Hubert of Belgium, which through breeding at the Benedictine Abbey of St. Hubert eventually became what is known as the St Hubert&#x27;s Hound around 1000 AD. St Hubert&#x27;s original hounds are descended from the Laconian (Spartan) Hound, one of four groups of dogs discerned from Greek representations and descriptions. These scent hounds were described as large, slow, &quot;short-legged and deep mouthed&quot; dogs with a small head, straight nose, upright ears and long neck, and either tan with white markings or black with tan markings. Laconian Hounds were reputed to not give up the scent until they found their prey. They eventually found their way to Constantinople, and from there to Europe.

===France===
The first mention of a &quot;Basset&quot; dog appeared in La Venerie, an illustrated hunting text written by Jacques du Fouilloux in 1585. The name &quot;Basset&quot; has its origins in the Latin word for low, &quot;bassus&quot;, and the French diminutive -&quot;et&quot;. The dogs in Fouilloux&#x27;s text were used to hunt foxes and badgers. It is believed that the Basset type originated as a mutation in the litters of Norman Staghounds, a descendant of the St Hubert&#x27;s Hound. These precursors were most likely bred back to the St. Hubert&#x27;s Hound, among other derivative French hounds. Until after the French Revolution around the year 1789, hunting from horseback was the preserve of kings, large aristocratic families and of the country squires, and for this reason short-legged dogs were highly valued for hunting on foot.

Basset-type hounds became popular during the reign of Emperor Napoleon III (r. 1852–1870). In 1853, Emmanuel Fremiet, &quot;the leading sculptor of animals in his day&quot; exhibited bronze sculptures of Emperor Napoleon III&#x27;s Basset Hounds at the Paris Salon. Ten years later in 1863 at the first exhibition of dogs held in Paris, Basset Hounds attained international attention.

The controlled breeding of the short haired Basset began in France in 1870. From the existing Bassets, Count Le Couteulx of Canteleu fixed a utilitarian type with straight front legs known as the Chien d&#x27;Artois, whereas Mr. Louis Lane developed a more spectacular type, with crooked front legs, known as the Basset Normand. These were bred together to create the original Basset Artésien Normand.

===England===

French Basset Hounds were being imported into England at least as early as the 1870s. While some of these dogs were certainly Basset Artésien Normands, by the 1880s linebreeding had thrown back to a different heavier type. Everett Millais, who is considered to be the father of the modern Basset Hound, bred one such dog, Nicholas, to a Bloodhound bitch named Inoculation through artificial insemination in order to create a heavier Basset in England in the 1890s. The litter was delivered by caesarean section, and the surviving pups were refined with French and English Bassets. The first breed standard for what is now known as the Basset Hound was made in Great Britain at the end of 19th century. This standard was updated in 2010.

==Hunting with Bassets==

The Basset Hound was bred to hunt, with a keen nose and short stature suited to small-game hunting on foot. A variety of Basset Hound developed purely for hunting by Colonel Morrison was admitted to the Masters of Basset Hounds Association in 1959 via an appendix to the Stud Book. This breed differs in being straighter and longer in the leg and having shorter ears.

==In popular culture==

*Basset Hounds have been featured in popular culture many times. Some artists, such as director Mamoru Oshii and webcomic artist Scott Kurtz, regularly feature their pet Bassets in their work.
*On February 27, 1928, &quot;Time&quot; magazine featured a Basset Hound on the front cover. The accompanying story was about the 52nd annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square Garden as if observed by the Basset Hound puppy.
*Many cartoon dogs are based on the Basset, such as Droopy, with several Bassets appearing in animated Disney films. Syndicated comic strip &quot;Fred Basset&quot; has been a regular feature in newspapers since 1963.
*There is a Basset Hound in the &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; movie series. The dog, Fred, was personally picked by lead actor Burt Reynolds because it refused to obey commands.
*In Disney&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;, a Basset Hound named Toby is the dog of Sherlock Holmes.
*In the early days of television, Elvis Presley famously sang &quot;Hound Dog&quot; to an uninterested top hat-wearing Basset Hound named Sherlock on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; on July 1, 1956
*Another television Basset in the 1950s was Morgan. He appeared often on &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; and many other variety shows. He played a dog from Pluto on &quot;Captain Video&quot; and appeared in a Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis movie. His last appearance was on the Hallmark Hall of Fame, playing against Tom Bosley in 1959. He had a plush toy modeled on him. and appeared in a &quot;Life&quot; magazine article. Despite the article, he was never known as J J Morgan.
*In the television series &quot;Columbo&quot;, Lieutenant Columbo owns a Basset Hound named Dog. Originally, it was not going to appear in the show because Peter Falk believed that it &quot;already had enough gimmicks&quot; but once the two met, Falk stated that Dog &quot;was exactly the type of dog that Columbo would own&quot;, so he was added to the show and made his first appearance in 1972&#x27;s &quot;Étude in Black&quot;.
*In the young adult novel &quot;The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks&quot;, the Basset Hound is the symbol of college society the Loyal Order of the Basset Hound.
*From the third season on of the television series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane owned a lazy basset hound named Flash. Flash hated Boss Hogg but loved the Dukes.
*Basset Hounds are often used as advertising logos. The logo for Hush Puppies brand shoes prominently features a Basset Hound whose real name is Jason. Basset Hounds are occasionally referred to as &quot;hush puppies&quot; for that reason. A Basset Hound also serves as the companion to the lonely Maytag Man in Maytag appliance advertisements. Tidewater Petroleum advertised its &quot;Flying A&quot; gasoline using a Basset Hound named Axelrod.

<text>The was a series of air raids on Japan launched by the United States Army Air Forces during the Pacific Theatre of World War II in 1944–1945, prior to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The raids that were conducted by the U.S. military on the night of 9–10 March 1945, codenamed Operation Meetinghouse, are the single most destructive bombing raid in human history. of central Tokyo was destroyed, leaving an estimated 100,000 civilians dead and over one million homeless. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945, by comparison, resulted in the immediate death of an estimated 70,000 to 150,000 people.

The U.S. mounted the Doolittle Raid, a seaborne, small-scale air raid on Tokyo in April 1942. Strategic bombing and urban area bombing began in 1944 after the long-range B-29 Superfortress bomber entered service, first deployed from China and thereafter the Mariana Islands. B-29 raids from those islands began on 17 November 1944, and lasted until 15 August 1945, the day of Japanese surrender.

Over half of Tokyo&#x27;s industry was spread out among residential and commercial neighborhoods; firebombing cut the city&#x27;s output in half. Some modern post-war analysts have called the raid a war crime due to the targeting of civilian infrastructure and the ensuing mass loss of civilian life.

==Doolittle Raid==

The first raid on Tokyo was the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942. In the raid, sixteen B-25 Mitchells were launched from at Yokohama and Tokyo, and then flew to airfields in China. The raid was retaliation against the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The raid did little damage to Japan&#x27;s war capability but was a significant propaganda victory for the United States. Launched at longer range than planned when the task force encountered a Japanese picket boat, all of the attacking aircraft either crashed or ditched short of the airfields designated for landing. One aircraft landed in the neutral Soviet Union where the crew was interned, but then smuggled over the border into Iran on 11 May 1943. Two crews were captured by the Japanese in occupied China. Three crewmen from these groups were later executed.

==B-29 raids==
The key development for the bombing of Japan was the B-29 Superfortress strategic bomber, which had an operational range of and was capable of attacking at high altitude above , where enemy defenses were very weak. Almost 90% of the bombs dropped on the home islands of Japan were delivered by the B-29. Once Allied ground forces had captured islands sufficiently close to Japan, airfields were built on those islands (particularly Saipan and Tinian) and B-29s could reach Japan for bombing missions.

The initial raids were carried out by the Twentieth Air Force operating out of mainland China in Operation Matterhorn under XX Bomber Command, but these could not reach Tokyo. Operations from the Northern Mariana Islands commenced in November 1944 after the XXI Bomber Command was activated there. The high-altitude bombing attacks using general-purpose bombs were observed to be ineffective by USAAF leaders due to high winds—later discovered to be the jet stream—which carried the bombs off target. Between May and September 1943, bombing trials were conducted on the Japanese Village set-piece target, located at the Dugway Proving Grounds. These trials demonstrated the effectiveness of incendiary bombs against wood-and-paper buildings, and resulted in Curtis LeMay&#x27;s ordering the bombers to change tactics to utilize these munitions against Japan.

The first such raid was against Kobe on 4 February 1945. Tokyo was hit by incendiaries on 25 February 1945 when 174 B-29s flew a high altitude raid during daylight hours and destroyed around (2.6 km2) of the snow-covered city, using 453.7 tons of mostly incendiaries with some fragmentation bombs. After this raid, LeMay ordered the B-29 bombers to attack again but at a relatively low altitude of and at night, because Japan&#x27;s anti-aircraft artillery defenses were weakest in this altitude range, and the fighter defenses were ineffective at night. LeMay ordered all defensive guns but the tail gun removed from the B-29s so that the aircraft would be lighter and use less fuel.

===Operation Meetinghouse===
On the night of 9–10 March 1945, 334 B-29s took off to raid with 279 of them dropping 1,665 tons of bombs on Tokyo. The bombs were mostly the E-46 cluster bomb which released 38 napalm-carrying M-69 incendiary bomblets at an altitude of . The M-69s punched through thin roofing material or landed on the ground; in either case they ignited 3–5 seconds later, throwing out a jet of flaming napalm globs. A lesser number of M-47 incendiaries were also dropped: the M-47 was a jelled-gasoline and white phosphorus bomb which ignited upon impact. In the first two hours of the raid, 226 of the attacking aircraft unloaded their bombs to overwhelm the city&#x27;s fire defenses. The first B-29s to arrive dropped bombs in a large X pattern centered in Tokyo&#x27;s densely populated working class district near the docks in both Koto and Chūō city wards on the water; later aircraft simply aimed near this flaming X. The individual fires caused by the bombs joined to create a general conflagration, which would have been classified as a firestorm but for prevailing winds gusting at . Approximately of the city were destroyed and some 100,000 people are estimated to have been killed. A grand total of 282 of the 339 B-29s launched for &quot;Meetinghouse&quot; made it to the target, 27 of which were lost due to being shot down by Japanese air defenses, mechanical failure, or being caught in updrafts caused by the fires.

The Operation Meetinghouse firebombing of Tokyo on the night of 9 March 1945 was the single deadliest air raid of World War II, greater than Dresden, Hamburg, Hiroshima, or Nagasaki as single events.

===Results===

Damage to Tokyo&#x27;s heavy industry was slight until firebombing destroyed much of the light industry that was used as an integral source for small machine parts. Firebombing also killed or made homeless many workers. According to the victorious US report, over 50% of Tokyo&#x27;s industry was spread out among residential and commercial neighborhoods; firebombing cut the whole city&#x27;s output in half. The destruction and damage were especially severe in the eastern areas of the city. The districts bombed were home to 1.2 million people. Tokyo police recorded 267,171 buildings destroyed, which left more than one million people homeless.

Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s tour of the destroyed areas of Tokyo in March 1945 was the beginning of his involvement in the peace process, culminating in Japan&#x27;s surrender six months later.

===Casualty estimates===

The US Strategic Bombing Survey later estimated that nearly 88,000 people died in this one raid, 41,000 were injured, and over a million residents lost their homes. The Tokyo Fire Department estimated a higher toll: 97,000 killed and 125,000 wounded. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department established a figure of 83,793 dead and 40,918 wounded and 286,358 buildings and homes destroyed. Historian Richard Rhodes put deaths at over 100,000, injuries at a million and homeless residents at a million. These casualty and damage figures could be low; Mark Selden wrote in &quot;Japan Focus&quot;:


In his 1968 book, reprinted in 1990, historian Gabriel Kolko cited a figure of 125,000 deaths. Elise K. Tipton, professor of Japan studies, arrived at a rough range of 75,000 to 200,000 deaths. Donald L. Miller, citing Knox Burger, stated that there were &quot;at least 100,000&quot; Japanese deaths and &quot;about one million&quot; injured.

The entire bombing campaign against Japan killed more than 300,000 people and injured an additional 400,000, mostly civilians.

==Postwar recovery==

After the war, Tokyo struggled to rebuild. In 1945 and 1946, the city received a share of the national reconstruction budget roughly proportional to its amount of bombing damage (26.6%), but in successive years Tokyo saw its share dwindle. By 1949, Tokyo was given only 10.9% of the budget; at the same time there was runaway inflation devaluing the money. Occupation authorities such as Joseph Dodge stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.

==Memorials==

Between 1948 and 1951 the ashes of 105,400 people killed in the attacks on Tokyo were interred in Yokoamicho Park in Sumida Ward. A memorial to the raids was opened in the park in March 2001. The park has a list of names of people who died due to the bombings is made based on applications from bereaved families; it had 81,273 names as of March 2020. Bereaved families can submit applications to the government of Tokyo to have names of victims added to the list.

After the war, Japanese author Katsumoto Saotome, a survivor of the 10 March 1945 firebombing, helped start a library about the raid in Koto Ward called the Center of the Tokyo Raids and War Damage. The library contains documents and literature about the raid plus survivor accounts collected by Saotome and the Association to Record the Tokyo Air Raid.

==Postwar Japanese politics==
In 2007, 112 members of the Association for the Bereaved Families of the Victims of the Tokyo Air Raids brought a class action against the Japanese government, demanding an apology and 1.232 billion yen in compensation. Their suit charged that the Japanese government invited the raid by failing to end the war earlier, and then failed to help the civilian victims of the raids while providing considerable support to former military personnel and their families. The plaintiffs&#x27; case was dismissed at the first judgement in December 2009, and their appeal was rejected. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court, which rejected their case in May 2013.

In 2013, during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe&#x27;s second term, Abe&#x27;s cabinet stated that the raids were &quot;incompatible with humanitarianism, which is one of the foundations of international law&quot;, but also noted that it is difficult to argue whether the raids were illegal under the international laws of the time.

===Other===
16–17 February 1945: carrier-based aircraft, including dive bombers, escorted by Hellcat fighters attacked Tokyo. Over two days, over 1,500 American planes and hundreds of Japanese planes were in the air. &quot;By the end of 17 February, more than five hundred Japanese planes, both on the ground and in the air, had been lost, and Japan&#x27;s aircraft works had been badly hit. The Americans lost eighty planes.&quot;

18 August 1945: The last U.S. air combat casualty of the Pacific War occurred during mission 230 A-8, when two Consolidated B-32 Dominators of the 386th Bomb Squadron, 312th Bomb Group, launched from Yontan Airfield, Okinawa, for a photo reconnaissance run over Tokyo, Japan. Both bombers were attacked by several Japanese fighters of both the 302nd Naval Air Group at Atsugi and the Yokosuka Air Group that made 10 gunnery passes. Japanese IJNAS aces Sadamu Komachi and Saburō Sakai were part of this attack. The B-32 piloted by 1st Lt. John R. Anderson, was hit at 20,000 feet; cannon fire knocked out the number two (port inner) engine, and three crew were injured, including Sgt. Anthony J. Marchione, 19, of the 20th Reconnaissance Squadron, who took a 20 mm hit to the chest and died 30 minutes later. Tail gunner Sgt. John Houston destroyed one attacker. The lead bomber, Consolidated B-32-20-CF Dominator, &quot;42-108532&quot;, &quot;Hobo Queen II&quot;, piloted by 1st Lt. James Klein, was not seriously damaged but the second Consolidated B-32-35-CF Dominator, &quot;42-108578&quot;, lost an engine, had the upper turret knocked out of action, and partially lost rudder control. Both bombers landed at Yontan Airfield just past ~1800 hrs. having survived the last air combat of the Pacific war. The following day, propellers were removed from Japanese aircraft as part of the surrender agreement. Marchione was buried on Okinawa on 19 August, his body being returned to his Pottstown, Pennsylvania home on 18 March 1949. He was interred in St. Aloysius Old Cemetery with full military honors. &quot;Hobo Queen II&quot; was dismantled at Yonton Airfield following a 9 September nosegear collapse and damage during lifting. B-32, &quot;42-108578&quot;, was scrapped at Kingman, Arizona after the war.

<text>A storyboard is a graphic organizer that consists of simple illustrations or images displayed in sequence for the purpose of pre-visualizing a motion picture, animation, motion graphic or interactive media sequence. The storyboarding process, in the form it is known today, was developed at Walt Disney Productions during the early 1930s, after several years of similar processes being in use at Walt Disney and other animation studios.

==Origins==
Many large budget silent films were storyboarded, but most of this material has been lost during the reduction of the studio archives during the 1970s and 1980s. Special effects pioneer Georges Méliès is known to have been among the first filmmakers to use storyboards and pre-production art to visualize planned effects. However, storyboarding in the form widely known today was developed at the Walt Disney studio during the early 1930s. In the biography of her father, &quot;The Story of Walt Disney&quot; (Henry Holt, 1956), Diane Disney Miller explains that the first complete storyboards were created for the 1933 Disney short &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;. According to John Canemaker, in &quot;Paper Dreams: The Art and Artists of Disney Storyboards&quot; (1999, Hyperion Press), the first storyboards at Disney evolved from comic book-like &quot;story sketches&quot; created in the 1920s to illustrate concepts for animated cartoon short subjects such as &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; and &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, and within a few years the idea spread to other studios.

According to Christopher Finch in &quot;The Art of Walt Disney&quot; (Finch, 1995), Disney credited animator Webb Smith with creating the idea of drawing scenes on separate sheets of paper and pinning them up on a bulletin board to tell a story in sequence, thus creating the first storyboard. Furthermore, it was Disney who first recognized the necessity for studios to maintain a separate &quot;story department&quot; with specialized storyboard artists (that is, a new occupation distinct from animators), as he had realized that audiences would not watch a film unless its story gave them a reason to care about the characters. The second studio to switch from &quot;story sketches&quot; to storyboards was Walter Lantz Productions in early 1935; by 1936 Harman-Ising and Leon Schlesinger Productions also followed suit. By 1937 or 1938, all American animation studios were using storyboards.

&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) was one of the first live-action films to be completely storyboarded. William Cameron Menzies, the film&#x27;s production designer, was hired by producer David O. Selznick to design every shot of the film.

Storyboarding became popular in live-action film production during the early 1940s and grew into a standard medium for the previsualization of films. Pace Gallery curator Annette Micheloson, writing of the exhibition &quot;Drawing into Film: Director&#x27;s Drawings&quot;, considered the 1940s to 1990s to be the period in which &quot;production design was largely characterized by the adoption of the storyboard&quot;. Storyboards are now an essential part of the creative process.

==Use==
===Film===

A film storyboard (sometimes referred to as a shooting board), is essentially a series of frames, with drawings of the sequence of events in a film, similar to a comic book of the film or some section of the film produced beforehand. It helps film directors, cinematographers and television commercial advertising clients visualize the scenes and find potential problems before they occur. Besides this, storyboards also help estimate the cost of the overall production and save time. Often storyboards include arrows or instructions that indicate movement. For fast-paced action scenes, monochrome line art might suffice. For slower-paced dramatic films with an emphasis on lighting, color impressionist style art might be necessary.

In creating a motion picture with any degree of fidelity to a script, a storyboard provides a visual layout of events as they are to be seen through the camera lens. In the case of interactive media, it is the layout and sequence in which the user or viewer sees the content or information. In the storyboarding process, most technical details involved in crafting a film or interactive media project can be efficiently described either in a picture or in additional text.

During principal photography for live-action films, scenes are rarely shot in the sequence in which they occur in the script. It is also sometimes necessary to film individual shots within a scene out of order and on different days, which can be very confusing. (The reasons for this are explained at length in the production board article.) In the latter scenario, directors can use storyboards on set to quickly refresh their memory as to the desired effect when those shots are later edited together in the correct order. This is more efficient than having to reread the script for each shot (with cast and crew waiting) to refresh their memory as to how they originally visualized they would film that shot.

===Theatre===
A common misconception is that storyboards are not used in theatre. Directors and playwrights frequently use storyboards as special tools to understand the layout of the scene. The great Russian theatre practitioner Stanislavski developed storyboards in his detailed production plans for his Moscow Art Theatre performances (such as of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; in 1898). The German director and dramatist Bertolt Brecht developed detailed storyboards as part of his dramaturgical method of &quot;fabels.&quot;

===Animatics===
In animation and special effects work, the storyboarding stage may be followed by simplified mock-ups called &quot;animatics&quot; to give a better idea of how a scene will look and feel with motion and timing. At its simplest, an animatic is a sequence of still images (usually taken from a storyboard) displayed in sync with rough dialogue (i.e., scratch vocals) or rough soundtrack, essentially providing a simplified overview of how various visual and auditory elements will work in conjunction to one another.

This allows the animators and directors to work out any screenplay, camera positioning, shot list, and timing issues that may exist with the current storyboard. The storyboard and soundtrack are amended if necessary, and a new animatic may be created and reviewed by the production staff until the storyboard is finalized. Editing at the animatic stage can help a production avoid wasting time and resources on the animation of scenes that would otherwise be edited out of the film at a later stage. A few minutes of screen time in traditional animation usually equates to months of work for a team of traditional animators, who must painstakingly draw and paint countless frames, meaning that all that labor (and salaries already paid) will have to be written off if the finished scene simply does not work in the film&#x27;s final cut. In the context of computer animation, storyboarding helps minimize the construction of unnecessary scene components and models, just as it helps live-action filmmakers evaluate what portions of sets need not be constructed because they will never come into the frame.

Often storyboards are animated with simple zooms and pans to simulate camera movement (using non-linear editing software). These animations can be combined with available animatics, sound effects, and dialog to create a presentation of how a film could be shot and cut together. Some feature film DVD &quot;special features&quot; include production animatics, which may have scratch vocals or may even feature vocals from the actual cast (usually where the scene was cut after the vocal recording phase but before the animation production phase).

Animatics are also used by advertising agencies to create inexpensive test commercials. A variation, the &quot;rip-o-matic&quot;, is made from scenes of existing movies, television programs or commercials, to simulate the look and feel of the proposed commercial. Rip, in this sense, refers to ripping-off an original work to create a new one.

===Photomatic===
A Photomatic (probably derived from &#x27;animatic&#x27; or photo-animation) is a series of still photographs edited together and presented on screen in a sequence. Sound effects, voice-overs, and a soundtrack are added to the piece to show how a film could be shot and cut together. Increasingly used by advertisers and advertising agencies to research the effectiveness of their proposed storyboard before committing to a &#x27;full up&#x27; television advertisement.

The Photomatic is usually a research tool, similar to an animatic, in that it represents the work to a test audience so that the commissioners of the work can gauge its effectiveness.

Originally, photographs were taken using a color negative film. A selection would be made from contact sheets and prints made. The prints would be placed on a rostrum and recorded to videotape using a standard video camera. Any moves, pans or zooms would have to be made in-camera. The captured scenes could then be edited.

Digital photography, web access to stock photography and non-linear editing programs have had a marked impact on this way of filmmaking also leading to the term &#x27;digimatic&#x27;. Images can be shot and edited very quickly to allow important creative decisions to be made &#x27;live&#x27;. Photo composite animations can build intricate scenes that would normally be beyond many test film budgets.

Photomatix was also the trademarked name of many of the booths found in public places which took photographs by coin operation. The Photomatic brand of the booths was manufactured by the International Mutoscope Reel Company of New York City. Earlier versions took only one photo per coin, and later versions of the booths took a series of photos. Many of the booths would produce a strip of four photos in exchange for a coin.

===Comic books===
Some writers have used storyboard type drawings (albeit rather sketchy) for their scripting of comic books, often indicating staging of figures, backgrounds, and balloon placement with instructions to the artist as needed often scribbled in the margins and the dialogue or captions indicated. John Stanley and Carl Barks (when he was writing stories for the Junior Woodchuck title) are known to have used this style of scripting.

In Japanese comics, the word is used for rough manga storyboards.

===Business===
Storyboards used for planning advertising campaigns such as corporate video production, commercials, a proposal or other business presentations intended to convince or compel to action are known as presentation boards. Presentation boards will generally be a higher quality render than shooting boards as they need to convey expression, layout, and mood. Modern ad agencies and marketing professionals will create presentation boards either by hiring a storyboard artist to create hand-drawn illustrated frames or often use sourced photographs to create a loose narrative of the idea they are trying to sell. Storyboards can also be used to visually understand the consumer experience by mapping out the customer&#x27;s journey brands can better identify potential pain points and anticipate their emerging needs.

Some consulting firms teach the technique to their staff to use during the development of client presentations, frequently employing the &quot;brown paper technique&quot; of taping presentation slides (in sequential versions as changes are made) to a large piece of kraft paper which can be rolled up for easy transport. The initial storyboard may be as simple as slide titles on Post-It notes, which are then replaced with draft presentation slides as they are created.

Storyboards also exist in accounting in the ABC System activity-based costing (ABC) to develop a detailed process flowchart which visually shows all activities and the relationships among activities. They are used in this way to measure the cost of resources consumed, identify and eliminate non-value-added costs, determine the efficiency and effectiveness of all major activities, and identify and evaluate new activities that can improve future performance.

A &quot;quality storyboard&quot; is a tool to help facilitate the introduction of a quality improvement process into an organization.

&quot;Design comics&quot; are a type of storyboard used to include a customer or other characters into a narrative. Design comics are most often used in designing websites or illustrating product-use scenarios during design. Design comics were popularized by Kevin Cheng and Jane Jao in 2006.

===Architectural studios===
Occasionally, architectural studios need a storyboard artist to visualize presentations of their projects. Usually, a project needs to be seen by a panel of judges and nowadays it&#x27;s possible to create virtual models of proposed new buildings, using advanced computer software to simulate lights, settings, and materials. Clearly, this type of work takes time – and so the first stage is a draft in the form of a storyboard, to define the various sequences that will subsequently be computer-animated.

===Novels===
Storyboards are now becoming more popular with novelists. Because most novelists write their stories by scenes rather than chapters, storyboards are useful for plotting the story in a sequence of events and rearranging the scenes accordingly.

===Interactive media===
More recently the term &quot;storyboard&quot; has been used in the fields of web development, software development, and instructional design to present and describe, in written, interactive events as well as audio and motion, particularly on user interfaces and electronic pages.

===Software===
Storyboarding is used in software development as part of identifying the specifications for a particular set of software. During the specification phase, screens that the software will display are drawn, either on paper or using other specialized software, to illustrate the important steps of the user experience. The storyboard is then modified by the engineers and the client while they decide on their specific needs. The reason why storyboarding is useful during software engineering is that it helps the user understand exactly how the software will work, much better than an abstract description. It is also cheaper to make changes to a storyboard than an implemented piece of software.

An example is the Storyboards system for designing GUI apps for iOS and macOS. Another example is Boords, an online storyboarding software used for planning video projects.

=== Scientific research ===
Storyboards are used in linguistic fieldwork to elicit spoken language. An informant is usually presented with a simplified graphical depiction of a situation or story, and asked to describe the depicted situation, or to re-tell the depicted story. The speech is recorded for linguistic analysis.

==Benefits==
One advantage of using storyboards is that it allows (in film and business) the user to experiment with changes in the storyline to evoke stronger reaction or interest. Flashbacks, for instance, are often the result of sorting storyboards out of chronological order to help build suspense and interest.

Another benefit of storyboarding is that the production can plan the movie in advance. In this step, things like the type of camera shot, angle, and blocking of characters are decided.

The process of visual thinking and planning allows a group of people to brainstorm together, placing their ideas on storyboards and then arranging the storyboards on the wall. This fosters more ideas and generates consensus inside the group.

==Creation==
Storyboards for films are created in a multiple-step process. They can be created by hand drawing or digitally on a computer. The main characteristics of a storyboard are:

* Visualize the storytelling.
* Focus the story and the timing in several key frames (very important in animation).
* Define the technical parameters: description of the motion, the camera, the lighting, etc.

If drawing by hand, the first step is to create or download a storyboard template. These look much like a blank comic strip, with space for comments and dialogue. Then sketch a &quot;thumbnail&quot; storyboard. Some directors sketch thumbnails directly in the script margins. These storyboards get their name because they are rough sketches not bigger than a thumbnail. For some motion pictures, thumbnail storyboards are sufficient.

However, some filmmakers rely heavily on the storyboarding process. If a director or producer wishes, more detailed and elaborate storyboard images are created. These can be created by professional storyboard artists by hand on paper or digitally by using 2D storyboarding programs. Some software applications even supply a stable of storyboard-specific images making it possible to quickly create shots that express the director&#x27;s intent for the story. These boards tend to contain more detailed information than thumbnail storyboards and convey more of the mood for the scene. These are then presented to the project&#x27;s cinematographer who achieves the director&#x27;s vision.

Finally, if needed, 3D storyboards are created (called &#x27;technical previsualization&#x27;). The advantage of 3D storyboards is they show exactly what the film camera will see using the lenses the film camera will use. The disadvantage of 3D is the amount of time it takes to build and construct the shots. 3D storyboards can be constructed using 3D animation programs or digital puppets within 3D programs. Some programs have a collection of low-resolution 3D figures which can aid in the process. Some 3D applications allow cinematographers to create &quot;technical&quot; storyboards which are optically-correct shots and frames.

While technical storyboards can be helpful, optically-correct storyboards may limit the director&#x27;s creativity. In classic motion pictures such as Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, the director created storyboards that were initially thought by cinematographers to be impossible to film. Such innovative and dramatic shots had &quot;impossible&quot; depth of field and angles where there was &quot;no room for the camera&quot; – at least not until creative solutions were found to achieve the ground-breaking shots that the director had envisioned.

<text>The Lada Niva Legend, formerly called the Lada Niva, VAZ-2121, VAZ-2131, and Lada 4×4 (), is a series of four-wheel drive, small (hatchback), and compact (wagon and pickup) off-road cars designed and produced by AvtoVAZ since 1977. Initially aimed at the rural market, later models also targeted urban users. The three- and later five-door 4×4 hatchbacks were sold under the Lada marque in many markets, and have been in continuous production since 1977.

In the 1990s, three and five-door wagons on a longer wheelbase and an extra-long wheelbase pick-up were added to the range. After the original Land Rover and its successor, the Land Rover Defender, were discontinued in 2016, the Niva became the longest production run off-road light vehicle still manufactured in its original form. By the end of 2020, an estimated 650,000 Lada Nivas had been sold globally.

The Lada Niva is the world&#x27;s first mass-produced off-road vehicle with a unibody construction (fully integrated body and frame). It is the predecessor of current crossover SUVs, most of which are built similarly.

In August 2020, Lada took over production of the 2003 Chevrolet Niva and rebranded it the &quot;new&quot; Lada Niva. In December 2020, the new Niva was further rebranded as the Lada Niva Travel, while the old model was renamed Lada Niva Legend in January 2021.

Outside Russia, the Niva primarily competes with the Suzuki Jimny, a similarly designed off-road mini SUV.

==Name==
Нива (Niva) is a Russian word that literally means &quot;(corn) field&quot;, but also &quot;area of practice&quot;. The name &quot;Niva &quot;(НИВА) was formed as an acronym from the initials of Niva&#x27;s chief designers&#x27; children: Pyotr Prusov&#x27;s two daughters and Vladimir Solovyev&#x27;s two sons.

The Lada Niva was formerly called the Lada 4×4, or the VAZ-2121 in the domestic Russian market. The name was changed after the brand was transferred to General Motors, though AvtoVAZ retained the rights to the equivalent Cyrillic name: Нива. It was also marketed as the Lada Sport in Iceland, Lada Taiga in Austria, and Lada Cossack in the United Kingdom. In 2014, it was sold as the LADA 4×4 in Russia. Since 2021, it is sold as the Lada Niva Legend in Russia.

==History==

===Prototypes and testing===
The Niva was described by its designers as a &quot;Renault 5 put on a Land Rover chassis&quot;. Development began in 1971 after the 24th Congress of the CPSU, in which Alexei Kosygin (the then-Premier of the Soviet Union) gave the designers at VAZ and AZLK the task of creating a car suitable for rural areas (specifically for the villagers and farmers of the Soviet Union), since the usual Zhiguli, Moskvitch, and Zaporozhets, intended primarily for ordinary people, were not much of use in the isolated areas that made up a large part of the USSR. In the same year, a team of VAZ designers led by Solovyev began competing with AZLK to work on a &quot;civilized&quot; four-wheel drive vehicle. The new car was partly inspired by the IZh-14 prototype of 1974. It was VAZ&#x27;s first model that was not based on Fiat, though many of its mechanics were carried over from the earlier Fiat 124- or 125-based Zhiguli models (mostly the VAZ-2103 and 2106); the body, four-wheel drive system, and front suspension were all designed by VAZ. The first prototype appeared in 1971 and was officially designated the E-2121 and nicknamed &quot;krokodil&quot; (the crocodile) due to its distinctive frontal section, but was rejected for being too utilitarian, so doors and a hardtop were added. This version (designated the 2E-2121) debuted in 1973 and deviated from the off-road vehicles of the period, as it used a modern hatchback body. The design choice was inspired by the prototype known as the VAZ-1101 (itself derived from the Fiat 127), and was created by designer Valery Pavlovitch.

The influence of the Fiat 127 is obvious from the Niva&#x27;s distinctive &quot;clamshell&quot; hood design and its rear three-quarter section. The 1974 prototype (designated the VAZ-2121M) was derived from an existing model, the VAZ-2103 (then the newest model in VAZ arsenal). It used the VAZ-2103&#x27;s 1,452 cc engine and shared some of its features, like chrome-plated bumpers, headlights and taillights, instruments, seats, and steering wheel. In the following year, two samples of the prototype were modified to install a 1,478 cc UZAM-412 engine, which originally powered the Moskvich 1500. Testing later revealed that the engine was incompatible with the newly designed car. The Moskvich engine was abandoned, and the older engine was reused. The 1974 prototype (2121M) was ready to be mass-produced in 1975, but the appearance of the new VAZ-2106 at the end of the year resulted in a delay because the company wanted to develop another prototype based on the model in 1976, which became the sixth and final (serial production) prototype.

Before its production, the Niva was tested over a period of years by a team led by Vadim Kotlyarov in the most difficult terrain of the Soviet Union, such as the Ural Mountains and Siberia, the deserts of the Kazakh SSR, and the Pamir Mountains in the Tajik SSR, where it was compared with its military counterpart, the UAZ-469, and some Western off-road vehicles—the British-made Land Rover Series and the Range Rover Classic. Its off-road capabilities were demonstrated for the very first time, which were based on its effective permanent four-wheel drive system featuring a transfer case and central differential lock, with the combination of a short wheelbase (only 2,2m), relatively low weight (just over a ton), independent front suspension, small dimensions (3,74×1,68 m), and high ground clearance (about 265 mm). Its large but narrow wheels (175/80-R16 in dimensions), originally featuring domestically designed &quot;Voltyre&quot; VLI-5 high-tread tires, offered relatively strong ground pressure, which lowered the chances of slipping or getting bogged down off-road. For example, in the 1973 and 1974 trials, the Niva climbed a 58% slope, and crossed of water and of mud and snow. Solovyev died the following year and was replaced by engineer Pyotr Prusov, who took credit for creating the car.

In 1976, the final prototype appeared. The engine was changed to a one, the most powerful engine in VAZ during the Soviet era, taken from their VAZ-2106 (from which the production model of the first Niva generation was generally derived). Like the previous prototype, it featured a permanent four-wheel drive and a transfer case with a lockable central differential. The VAZ prototype displayed better design and real-world performance than its AZLK counterpart, the Moskvitch 416, so it was approved for production in March of the same year, after the 25th Congress of the CPSU. The car was named Niva 1600 (Field) for exports and the VAZ-2121 (alternatively &quot;Niva 2121&quot; or &quot;VAZ Niva&quot;) for the domestic market. For domestic customers, it was described as &quot;[a] high-speed car with the improved capabilities and comfort of all VAZ models,&quot; and also as &quot;[a] combination of the speed and comfort of a Zhiguli with the capabilities of a UAZ.&quot; Production began the following year on 5 April 1977, while the first export models appeared in 1978 at the Paris Motor Salon and quickly took over at least 40% of Europe&#x27;s market for four-wheel drive vehicles, making it Lada&#x27;s top-selling export. It was the only Soviet car that was ever sold in Japan, starting from the early 1980s. Because of export demand and the higher priority given to exports, domestic customers faced long wait times, despite the car being developed primarily for Soviet citizens.

===Design===

The original Niva has a naturally aspirated 1.6-L overhead-cam four-cylinder petrol engine producing and 126 N·m (93 lb·ft) at 5,000 rpm, a four-speed manual transmission, and a full-time four-wheel drive. The drive system uses three differentials: center, front, and rear. The transfer case involves a high/low range selector lever and another to lock the central differential. Like usual gear shifting, both of the aforementioned features naturally require the use of clutch to be properly selected. However, while the central differential can usually be locked while in motion, the transfer case cannot and requires a complete stop. The original Niva has a maximum speed of .

Coil springs are located at each of the four wheels, and the suspension is independent in front, whereas the rear axle is a five-link live-type, with ratios between 3.90 and 4.30 depending on the model and market. Ground clearance is , and go as far as deep in water.

The brakes are servo-assisted dual-circuit style and the clutch is hydraulic. The turning circle is 36.25 ft. Cargo space is , or with the rear seats folded down and, like the classic Zhiguli, the front seats can be set up to make two berths. A spare tire can be stored in the engine bay under the bonnet.

Additional equipment for the basic model was similar to other Lada and Eastern Bloc cars of the period; it included headlight wipers, a rear fog lamp, a right external mirror (for domestic units until the end of the 1980s), rear seat belts, a rear window wiper, a rear window heater, and a radio set. On the Niva 1.7 or VAZ-21213 from 1994, all of the above features except headlight wipers and the rear fog lamp (which were discontinued) became default and air conditioning, an antilock braking system, and a hydraulic servomotor for the steering column were made optional, although they became standard equipment on the newest models.

Foreign (usually Western) local Lada importers often offered their own additional equipment before buying the car, such as front and rear bull bars and roll bars, side rocker rails, roof rails, a winch, fender plastics, additional headlights for front bumper and for roof rails, and aftermarket aluminium rims, which can be often seen mounted on many Nivas.

The existing model was slightly restyled during first half of the 1980s when VAZ discontinued the VAZ-2103 (which had slowly been replaced by the VAZ-2106 since 1975). Due to high prices and production complexity, some of the chrome-plated elements disappeared in later models, such as the chrome-plated mask and rocker panel edges. Other elements were changed, such as the side mirrors, which became black metallic. The background of the front Lada badge was changed from red to white (and later black on the new model) on all models. The side rear retroreflectors (or turn signals on some models, depending on market) were replaced by Lada (left) and Niva (right) labels, and the rear mudflaps received the brand logo. For easier access to certain areas of the engine compartment, the window washer reservoir was moved from the left to the right section of the compartment (right in front of the battery). The interior was only minimally changed, along with some minor changes to the instrument panel and choke knob.

Pre-1985 models are visually recognized by the aforementioned details, and are rare today (almost nonexistent in a well-preserved condition), so they are highly valued by various collectors of classic cars. A mint-condition 1980 unit in Russia reached a price of five million RUB and ultimately sold for 3,2 million in 2016 (approximately €38,570 or $44,570), which remains the most expensive Niva ever sold.

The VAZ-2121 Niva or Lada Niva 1600 was in production until 1993 (it existed in parallel production with the new model until the end of 1993) when the newer and more powerful four-cylinder petrol engine was introduced, replacing the previously used VAZ-2106 engine. The standard Weber carburetor was replaced by a single-point fuel injection initially supplied by General Motors on the 21214/1.7i model, and an improved Solex carburetor on the 21213/1.7 model. The transmission was changed from four to five speeds, mechanical ignition was replaced, and the electronics and suspension received some relatively minor changes. The exhaust system was also slightly redesigned, and on newer models, the drive shafts received homokinetic joints.

On the exterior, the rear section of the body was redesigned with the tailgate extended and license plate on it. These changes prompted new vertical taillights that replaced the former VAZ-2106 horizontal ones and the VAZ-2102 chromed tailgate knob, which was replaced by a simple plastic handle. On the newest models, the old hand-adjustable, square black-metallic (previously chrome-plated) side mirrors, which originated from the VAZ-2103 were replaced with larger plastic ones that could be automatically adjusted.. The previous front Lada badge was replaced with the larger ellipsoid design. The Fiat 125 chrome-plated doorknobs are still present, though they are plastic on the newest models. Although the rest of the exterior has remained generally unchanged (except for the Lada 4×4 Urban and Bronto), the interior was almost completely redesigned and shares only a few interchangeable parts with the previous one: the archaic partially chrome-plated VAZ-2106 steering wheel was replaced with the more modern and thick one from the VAZ-2107 and later, even newer models, as well as its VAZ-2103/2106 instruments, which were replaced with the dashboard from the VAZ-21099. The black artificial leather seats that originated from the VAZ-2106 were replaced by higher, more modern ones from the VAZ-2108, with the front surface made of polyester, while the rear seat was improved for easier folding. The Fiat 124 swiveling windows from the side doors disappeared and were replaced with air conditioning, which was installed with the ABS and servomotor for the steering column as additional equipment on request, while the headlight wipers and rear fog lamp disappeared. It received completely new front and door panels (with interior door knobs relocated above the hand rests instead of under like on previous generation), various plastics and even new floor mats. The hand openings for the side-door windows was replaced with an automatic opening on the newest models (and on the Lada 4×4 Urban) starting from 2014. Multipoint fuel injection designed by Bosch has been used since 2004, replacing the previously mentioned single-point injection from General Motors.

===Later models===
The lengthened model of the Niva appeared in 1993. It was known as the VAZ-2129 and was produced very briefly, only for about a year, so it is very rare. It was also never exported. Although it has a longer wheelbase, it kept three doors like the basic hatchback model. In design, it was a hybrid of old and new generations, since it featured the old VAZ-2121 (Niva 1600) body and interiors combined with new VAZ-21213 (Niva 1.7) 1680-cc engine and 5-speed transmission (although later, 1994 production models featured even new body and interiors).

The lengthened estate model with a longer wheelbase and five doors was made in 1995. It was originally known as the VAZ-2131 Niva, but commercially, it has no difference in name from the standard three-door model, and it is often referred as the Niva five-door. Due to its increased weight from the longer wheelbase, it can use the 1774-cc inline four petrol engine. Although it was still in production like the basic model, it had limited use and was infrequently exported, mainly due to the longer wheelbase and increased weight, and it was slightly higher priced compared to the standard model. In 2015, a five-door model also appeared for the Lada 4×4 Urban.

In 1999, a diesel-engine model of the Niva known as the VAZ-21215 Niva, or commercially as the Lada Niva 1.9, was released. It was produced until 2007 and sold only in a few markets. It was powered by a 1905-cc Peugeot XUD 9SD inline four diesel engine, and it was less powerful than the standard VAZ-21213/21214 1680-cc petrol engine. However, the VAZ-21215 was a relatively short-lived model despite lower fuel consumption, because it was not popular in the domestic market, Peugeot stopped producing XUD engines in 2001 (although existing supplies were available until 2007, when the last VAZ-21215 came off the production line), and VAZ did not make another contract for diesel engine production for the Niva.

In 2006, the model with the carbureted engine of the new generation (VAZ-21213/Lada Niva 1.7) was discontinued, and the name Niva was formally dropped in favor of the new official name Lada 4×4, as General Motors received naming rights. The Niva was discontinued under the old Soviet VAZ-2121 domestic market classification.

In 2014, the new, restyled model called the Lada 4×4 Urban was released. It has more modern, ordinary looks, including a new mask, plastic bumpers, new side mirrors, different aluminium rims, new tires, a central brake light, heated front seats, and a slightly restyled interior. As of 2019, no version of the Lada 4x4 has airbags.

In 2017, the Lada 4×4 Bronto, intended mainly for off-road use, is released. It features characteristic mask and plastic bumpers with integrated front and rear fog lamps, plastic roof rails, new, larger wheels with black aluminium rims and 235/75-R16 Bontyre Stalker off-road tires, even higher ground clearance (increased another 35 mm) and plastic rust-protected body edges (fenders and rocker panels). Internally, it is similar to the Lada 4×4 URBAN, also featuring heated front seats. It also includes a front winch, roof headlights, and additional fog lights on the front bumper. With all the mentioned equipment included, the Bronto is currently the most expensive Lada 4×4 model, with a current price of 720 thousand RU in the domestic market (around €10,130). The slightly different pickup model designed by VIS was also revealed (featuring an integrated metallic grille, different bumpers, and a snorkel), called the Lada Bronto AMC.

On 5 April at the car&#x27;s 40th anniversary, a special, limited edition of the classic Lada 4×4 called the Lada 4×4 40th-Anniversary was presented, which used the 1977 design. It features new aluminium rims similar to the Urban, five new color schemes, &quot;40th Anniversary&quot; metallic labels on the fenders, a tailgate, a glove compartment cover, front-seat backrests, and floor mats. Also, it has a slightly restyled interior featuring genuine leather seat upholstery and a steering wheel cover, and sills made out of stainless steel. The model is available from June 2017 in both domestic and export markets.

A convertible version appeared back in 1983, but was neither serially produced nor designed by VAZ. It was a modification of the original Niva 1600 bodied by French coachbuilder Wassermann for the local market. It was known as the Niva Plein Soleil (Sunlight) and it was one of many Niva modifications made by local importers for their markets.

In recent years, changes included better lights, more comfortable seats, an instrument panels with LCD displays, alloy wheels, electric windows and mirrors, heated seats and air conditioning.

===Cossack and other importer special editions===
During the 1980s, local Lada importers in various markets made their own upgrades to help compete with more modern SUVs. In the UK, the Cossack model featured large body decals, roof rails, running boards, 15-in alloy wheels, and on some versions, a sunroof, steel bullbars, spotlights, a rear-mounted spare tire, and semi-bucket seats. Other markets&#x27; importers made similar upgrades and many were also called Cossack.

In 1995, Lada UK introduced a face-lifted version of the Niva Cossack and renamed the basic model as the &quot;Hussar&quot;. Whereas the Hussar had the original 1977 trim, the new UK Cossack featured a new Rover-designed grille and other body kit items, and gained soft nudge-bars at the front in deference to public opinion against bullbars. Both models received the same new 1.7-litre engine and a new deeper tailgate which extended the rear opening to the level of the bumper – a vast improvement over the original model&#x27;s high lip. Official Niva imports to the UK ceased in 1997 due to the importers having difficulty in sourcing the GM fuel injection unit required to satisfy ever-tightening UK emissions regulations.

Several attempts were made to reintroduce Ladas into the UK. In May 2010, the basic Niva became available again through an independent importer. Aimed largely at the agricultural market, three models were made available: the three-door, four-seat hatchback; a two-seat commercial van; and a two-door, four-seat pickup.

===VAZ-2122 Reka===

Although VAZ was meant exclusively to produce passenger cars, the Soviet military was impressed by its off-road capabilities and ordered VAZ to create a military version, to replace the UAZ-469 as the standard military 4×4 vehicle. In 1976, when VAZ-2121 development was almost finished, engineers from Tolyatti began working on an amphibian off-roader, which became known as VAZ-2122 Reka (River). A simplified and more rugged body was combined with the Niva chassis. It weighed about the same as the usual Niva, but instead of the 1600-cc VAZ-2106 engine, it used an older and less powerful 1300-cc engine derived from the VAZ-2101. Internally, it featured a different metal dashboard, though it used the same Niva instruments along with the same steering wheel and artificial leather seats.

Six different evolution prototypes were built. They were tested in an experimental military unit, on the proving grounds of the Ministry of Defense, and in the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan. The VAZ-2122 showed better results than the UAZ-469 (especially the fact that it featured amphibious capabilities, which UAZ did not have) and received very positive feedback; the military was satisfied with its capabilities, reliability, firmness and durability. By 1987, VAZ had completed development work, and the car was ready for mass production and military service. Nevertheless, the results were not enough to convince the military to start mass production.

===LWB Nivas===

Longer wheelbase versions – the five-door VAZ-2131, three-door VAZ-2129, and VAZ-2329 pickup were also produced from the 1990s, but not generally exported.

===Nameplate changes===

The Lada Niva was formally renamed Lada 4×4 back in 2006 and has a low-range gearbox, differential lock, ABS, airbags, heated front seats, air conditioning, servomotor for the steering column, underbody protection. Prices for the model started at €10,990. It is available in five body styles: three- and five-door hatchbacks, two- and four-door pickups, and a two-door van. Two petrol engines are available for the model – the standard 1.7-litre and the 1.8-litre (only for five-door model) along with a five-speed manual transmission.

Starting with the 2014 model year, the Niva nameplate was discontinued for the Russian market, and the vehicle is branded Lada 4×4 for both short and long wheelbases to make way for the upcoming restart of the Chevrolet Niva series, which was scheduled to start production by March 2015. Due to Russia–West economic relations, AvtoVAZ analysts suggested that the production of Chevrolet Niva may be delayed further into 2015.
== Lada Niva II ==
===1998 – 2002===

GM-AvtoVAZ, a joint venture between AvtoVAZ and General Motors, presented in 1998 the VAZ-2123, a new sport utility vehicle (SUV) based on the old VAZ 2121 engine, transmission and most mechanicals; but with a modern exterior design. 

===2003 – 2019===

In 2003, the VAZ-2123 was rebadged as the Chevrolet Niva. It features an updated body and 1.7-litre gasoline engine with fuel injection. Although the body and the interiors are new, it is still based on the old VAZ-2121 engine, transmission, and most mechanicals. Its off-road ability is exemplary compared with many modern budget SUVs, having been designed for tough tundra territory.

===2020 – Present===

In 2019 Lada acquired General Motors&#x27; stake in GM-AvtoVAZ and then announced that the Chevrolet Niva would be produced under Lada&#x27;s name. The rebranded Lada Niva was revealed by AvtoVAZ in July 2020, with the firm saying that there was still strong demand for the 20 year old line of cars. The 2020 model is produced at the Togliatti factory with minor design updates (but no technical changes) and joins the Lada 4×4 in the firm&#x27;s range.

In December 2020, following a new generation of the line, the new Lada Niva was further rebranded as Lada Niva Travel, while the old Lada 4x4 was rebranded as the Lada Niva Legend in January 2021.
==Safety by modern standards==
In 2002, the Lada Niva was awarded zero stars out of a possible four by the Russian ARCAP safety-assessment program. The reviewer noted the very rugged body of the car as the only positive aspect in terms of safety. During the safety test, the passenger dummy was hit by the glove compartment hard enough to risk traumatic brain injury.

The reviewers noted that they did not expect a high rating and that the result was natural, as &quot;it would be naive to believe that a 30-year-old design complies with modern requirements for passive safety&quot;. They added that a complete modernization of the car would be required to comply with modern safety standards.

==Uses==
The Niva was the first wheeled vehicle to spend more than 10 years in Antarctica, where the classic VAZ-2121 Niva (Lada Niva 1600) was used by the Soviet Antarctic Expedition for transportation of personnel and goods, communication between Antarctic stations, and towing boats. It covered more than in 1990–2001 and operated at temperatures as low as −54 °C. A Niva also reached the North Pole in 1998, when the lengthened VAZ-2131 Niva was dropped by parachute on ice and successfully completed its route, operating at an average temperature of −30 °C, becoming the first wheeled vehicle to spend time there. It also set the world record of the highest point ever reached by a motorized vehicle, when another VAZ-2131 climbed to the 5200-m-high base camp on Mount Everest in 1998 and even higher just a year later, on 16 September 1999, when a similar Niva belonging to the Saint Petersburg extreme expedition team reached a height of 5725 m on a Tibet mountain during off-roading. There is also visual confirmation of Russian soldiers using the Lada Niva as a method of transport for assaults in the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

==Assembly outside Russia==
Automeccanica assembled different versions of the Lada Niva in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including an in-house developed convertible version.

The Lada Niva was also assembled in Ecuador by Aymesa between December 2000 and 2004. In Uruguay, a vehicle armorer called Bognor (a subsidiary of PSA assemblers Oferol) teamed up with Latin American VAZ concessionaires Rusia Automotriz in 2002 to assemble armored Lada Nivas locally, calling them the Bognor Diva. The armouring parts were made locally, and all Divas were fitted with Peugeot&#x27;s 1.9-litre, diesel engine. Around 500 examples were built between 2003 and 2007 (192 knock-down kits were sent in 2003, the first year), with about 400 of them sold to Cuba.
==Concept cars==
===Chevrolet Niva Concept (2014)===
In August 2014 at the Moscow International Automobile Salon, GM-AvtoVAZ introduced the next generation Niva. The car had a longitudinal mounted engine, full-time four-wheel-drive, two-gear transfer case and rigid-axle rear suspension. The production model was supposed to get a 1.8-liter PSA Peugeot Citroën EC8 engine (135 hp) paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox. The production was expected to start in 2016, but GM had no interest in the model.

===Lada 4x4 Vision Concept (2018)===
In May 2018 AvtoVAZ patented the new concept car called the Lada 4x4 Vision. At a Moscow International Automobile Salon in August 2018, AvtoVAZ presented the concept, built in honour of the original Niva&#x27;s 40th anniversary. According to preliminary information, the car would be based on Renault Duster and production is scheduled to start in 2022 at the earliest.

==Modifications==


===Short/regular versions===

==== Lada 4×4 Urban ====
A version of the base three-door car, it sports updated bumpers, grille, steering wheel, and some additional options: power and heated mirrors, power windows, air conditioning, and alloy wheels. The car has been produced by VIS-Auto since October 2014.

===Vehicles based on the Niva===

==== VAZ-1922 Bronto &quot;March-1&quot; ====
Bronto March is one of the few mass-produced vehicles on ultra-large-diameter pneumatic wheels. A production is being made by the PSA Bronto in Tolyatti since 1997. In the first 8 years of production, about 350 cars were produced.

==== APAL-21541 &quot;Stalker&quot; ====

A modification based on the VAZ-21214, it was planned for series production at the plant &quot;Pishchemash&quot; in the city of Argun, Chechen Republic. This short run is made by LLC &quot;APAL&quot; since 2003.

===Long versions===
Niva with BRDM-2-style modification.

==Notable owners==
Vladimir Putin bought a Niva in May 2009. He showed his camouflage-painted Opel-engined offroader in the Russian media, allegedly to support domestic car producers despite the financial crisis.

Serbian football player Aleksandar Kolarov received a certificate for a Lada 4×4/Niva as a reward for scoring a goal in his team&#x27;s match against Costa Rica during the Russia 2018 World Cup.

<text>Cervera () is the capital of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Segarra, in the province of Lleida, Autonomous Community of Catalonia, Spain. The title Comte de Cervera is a courtesy title, formerly part of the Crown of Aragon, that has been revived for Leonor, Princess of Asturias. The city is also the birthplace of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champions Márquez brothers, eight-time champion Marc Márquez and two-time champion Álex Márquez. The church of Sant Miquel de Tudela is near Cervera.

==History==
=== The town and its medieval origins ===
In the year 1026, three peasant families built the first settlement in the comarca of Segarra, as in those days it was uninhabited. Later on, the Barcelona counts committed ownership of those lands to those people. By this, the counts wanted to establish their power in the area, as the Segarra was at that time the border between Christian and Muslim territories, thereby establishing the first fortress (&quot;castrum Cervarie&quot;).

When the Western border was established at Lleida at the year 1149, Cervera grew up into terraced houses on the other side of the border. The inhabitants were freed from the feudal lord&#x27;s abuses and with the royal privileges, the town gradually became established first as a Confraria (1182), then Consolat (municipal organ) (1202), and from 1267 up to the present, as a Paeria.

The most significant episode was the signature, in 1452, of the nuptial agreement between Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile (the Spanish Catholic Monarchs).

Historically, there was a prosperous Jewish community in Cervera, dating from the 12th century to the expulsion of the Jews in the 15th century.

In 1702, the town got the title of city from the king Philip V, for which the townspeople thanked the king. The king bestowed this title because in a small way during the war, and then more strongly after the war, the local people had demonstrated support for the king&#x27;s politics.

=== The university ===

Charles II, the last Spanish king from the house of Austria, died in 1700, and in his will he designated Philip V as his heir. The new king, with the name of Philip V, was accepted in the kingdom of Castile, as well as in Crown of Aragon. 
England, which was at the head of the opposing nations proposed Charles VI as the heir of the Spanish throne and in 1702 a European war started (the War of the Spanish Succession). An appropriate diplomatic intervention could make the Crown of Aragon finally give support to Charles VI. In Cervera, there were people in favour of both sides.

When the war was finished, Cervera, which had been destroyed, decided to give support to the ones who were governing (the Bourbons) and sent two ambassadors to the Courts with the mission to persuade the ministers of Philip V of his absolute support, with the goal to obtain some logical compensation and in one of their 30 requests, they requested one university like the one in the city of Lleida. Philip V, then, built the University of Cervera and closed the rest (the Nueva Planta decrees). The creation of the university gave an economic boost to the town, basically (among other reasons) because students lodged in the town.

=== Decay and prosperity ===
In 1842 the University was relocated to Barcelona, which portended an important economic loss.
However, when train service arrived in the town in 1860 along with improvements to some public services (such as the water supply) and as the establishment of some industries and an important wine trade, there was an improvement in the local economy.
When the Phylloxera arrived, this caused a lot of people with vineyards to go bankrupt, due to a major crisis with the Cervera wine trade, which recovered somewhat with the creation of the Sindicat Agrícola (1919).

<text>Ripoll () is the capital of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Ripollès, in the province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain. It is located on confluence of the Ter river and its tributary Freser, next to the Pyrenees near the border of France. The population was 11,057 in 2009.

== History ==

The first traces of humans inhabiting the area date from the Bronze Age and can be seen in form of dolmens such as those found in &quot;El Sot de Dones Mortes&quot; or in &quot;Pardinella&quot;. This area was later used by peoples from the Atlantic culture to store bronze weapons and as a passway from the Catalan Central Depression to the Pyrenees. The area also has tombs from the late Roman occupation age and some belonging to the Visigoths.

It has a famous Benedictine monastery built in the Romanesque style, Santa Maria de Ripoll, founded by the count Wilfred the Hairy in 879. The count used it as a centre to repopulate the region after conquering it. In the High Middle Ages, its castle, the Castle of Saguardia, located in the county of Les Llosses was ruled by the Saguàrdia family, of which Ponç de la Guàrdia was a famous troubadour.

An abundance of coal and iron ore, coupled with the ample water supply of the rivers Ter and Freser, encouraged a metal-working industry in the early Middle Ages. The furnaces of Ripoll were a prime source of nails for the peninsula. Later, pole arms and crossbows, always in demand, were added to Ripoll&#x27;s exports. Ripoll enjoyed a reputation throughout Europe for the production of firearms. That success as a manufactory of firearms brought frequent trouble to the city. French invasions in 1794, 1809, 1812, and 1813 crippled the city industries. However, the final and utter destruction of Ripoll, resulting from mines and blasting, occurred in 1839 during the Carlist Wars. Due to the loss of records and archives, not much is known of Ripoll and its industry to this day.

== Climate ==
Ripoll has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;) bordering on an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with cool winters and warm to hot summers. As in many areas of the province of Girona, rainfall is well distributed throughout the year. During the winter, temperatures below are common, although there may be some winters in which they do not occur.
== Demographics ==
Ripoll is over 5% Muslim, predominately of Moroccan origin, who arrived in the 1990s to work in industrial factories.

<doc id="68466" wikidata="Q1144257" url="?curid=68466" title="Gamma correction">
<text>Gamma correction or gamma is a nonlinear operation used to encode and decode luminance or tristimulus values in video or still image systems. Gamma correction is, in the simplest cases, defined by the following power-law expression:
: formula_1
where the non-negative real input value formula_2 is raised to the power formula_3 and multiplied by the constant &quot;A&quot; to get the output value formula_4. In the common case of , inputs and outputs are typically in the range 0–1.

A gamma value formula_5 is sometimes called an &quot;encoding gamma&quot;, and the process of encoding with this compressive power-law nonlinearity is called gamma compression; conversely, a gamma value formula_6 is called a &quot;decoding gamma&quot;, and the application of the expansive power-law nonlinearity is called gamma expansion.

==Explanation==
Gamma encoding of images is used to optimize the usage of bits when encoding an image, or bandwidth used to transport an image, by taking advantage of the non-linear manner in which humans perceive light and color. The human perception of brightness (lightness), under common illumination conditions (neither pitch black nor blindingly bright), follows an approximate power function (which has no relation to the gamma function), with greater sensitivity to relative differences between darker tones than between lighter tones, consistent with the Stevens power law for brightness perception. If images are not gamma-encoded, they allocate too many bits or too much bandwidth to highlights that humans cannot differentiate, and too few bits or too little bandwidth to shadow values that humans are sensitive to and would require more bits/bandwidth to maintain the same visual quality. Gamma encoding of floating-point images is not required (and may be counterproductive), because the floating-point format already provides a piecewise linear approximation of a logarithmic curve.

Although gamma encoding was developed originally to compensate for the brightness characteristics of cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays, that is not its main purpose or advantage in modern systems. In CRT displays, the light intensity varies nonlinearly with the electron-gun voltage. Altering the input signal by gamma compression can cancel this nonlinearity, such that the output picture has the intended luminance. However, the gamma characteristics of the display device do not play a factor in the gamma encoding of images and video. They need gamma encoding to maximize the visual quality of the signal, regardless of the gamma characteristics of the display device. The similarity of CRT physics to the inverse of gamma encoding needed for video transmission was a combination of coincidence and engineering, which simplified the electronics in early television sets.

Photographic film has a much greater ability to record fine differences in shade than can be reproduced on photographic paper. Similarly, most video screens are not capable of displaying the range of brightnesses (dynamic range) that can be captured by typical electronic cameras.
For this reason, considerable artistic effort is invested in choosing the reduced form in which the original image should be presented. The gamma correction, or contrast selection, is part of the photographic repertoire used to adjust the reproduced image.

Analogously, digital cameras record light using electronic sensors that usually respond linearly. In the process of rendering linear raw data to conventional RGB data (e.g. for storage into JPEG image format), color space transformations and rendering transformations will be performed. In particular, almost all standard RGB color spaces and file formats use a non-linear encoding (a gamma compression) of the intended intensities of the primary colors of the photographic reproduction. In addition, the intended reproduction is almost always nonlinearly related to the measured scene intensities, via a tone reproduction nonlinearity.

==Generalized gamma==
The concept of gamma can be applied to any nonlinear relationship. For the power-law relationship formula_7, the curve on a log–log plot is a straight line, with slope everywhere equal to gamma (slope is represented here by the derivative operator):
: formula_8

That is, gamma can be visualized as the slope of the input–output curve when plotted on logarithmic axes. For a power-law curve, this slope is constant, but the idea can be extended to any type of curve, in which case gamma (strictly speaking, &quot;point gamma&quot;) is defined as the slope of the curve in any particular region.

==Film photography==

When a photographic film is exposed to light, the result of the exposure can be represented on a graph showing log of exposure on the horizontal axis, and density, or negative log of transmittance, on the vertical axis. For a given film formulation and processing method, this curve is its characteristic or Hurter–Driffield curve. Since both axes use logarithmic units, the slope of the linear section of the curve is called the gamma of the film. Negative film typically has a gamma less than 1; positive film (slide film, reversal film) typically has a gamma with absolute value greater than 1.

==Standard gammas==

===Analog TV===
Output to CRT-based television receivers and monitors does not usually require further gamma correction. The standard video signals that are transmitted or stored in image files incorporate gamma compression matching the gamma expansion of the CRT (although it is not the exact inverse). 
For television signals, gamma values are fixed and defined by the analog video standards. CCIR System M and N, associated with NTSC color, use gamma 2.2; systems B/G, H, I, D/K, K1, L and M associated with PAL or SECAM color use gamma 2.8.

===Computer displays===

In most computer display systems, images are encoded with a gamma of about 0.45 and decoded with the reciprocal gamma of 2.2. A notable exception, until the release of Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) in September 2009, were Macintosh computers, which encoded with a gamma of 0.55 and decoded with a gamma of 1.8. In any case, binary data in still image files (such as JPEG) are explicitly encoded (that is, they carry gamma-encoded values, not linear intensities), as are motion picture files (such as MPEG). The system can optionally further manage both cases, through color management, if a better match to the output device gamma is required.
The sRGB color space standard used with most cameras, PCs, and printers does not use a simple power-law nonlinearity as above, but has a decoding gamma value near 2.2 over much of its range, as shown in the plot to the right/above. Below a compressed value of 0.04045 or a linear intensity of 0.00313, the curve is linear (encoded value proportional to intensity), so . The dashed black curve behind the red curve is a standard power-law curve, for comparison.

Gamma correction in computers is used, for example, to display a gamma = 1.8 Apple picture correctly on a gamma = 2.2 PC monitor by changing the image gamma. Another usage is equalizing of the individual color-channel gammas to correct for monitor discrepancies.

==Gamma meta information==
Some picture formats allow an image&#x27;s intended gamma (of transformations between encoded image samples and light output) to be stored as metadata, facilitating automatic gamma correction. The PNG specification includes the gAMA chunk for this purpose and with formats such as JPEG and TIFF the Exif Gamma tag can be used. Some formats can specify the ICC profile which includes a transfer function.

These features have historically caused problems, especially on the web. For HTML and CSS colors and JPG or GIF images without attached color profile metadata, popular browsers passed numerical color values to the display without color management, resulting in substantially different appearance between devices; however those same browsers sent images with gamma explicitly set in metadata through color management, and also applied a default gamma to PNG images with metadata omitted. This made it impossible for PNG images to simultaneously match HTML or untagged JPG colors on every device. This situation has since improved, as most major browsers now support the gamma setting (or lack of it).

==Power law for video display==
A &quot;gamma characteristic&quot; is a power-law relationship that approximates the relationship between the encoded luma in a television system and the actual desired image luminance.

With this nonlinear relationship, equal steps in encoded luminance correspond roughly to subjectively equal steps in brightness. Ebner and Fairchild used an exponent of 0.43 to convert linear intensity into lightness (luma) for neutrals; the reciprocal, approximately 2.33 (quite close to the 2.2 figure cited for a typical display subsystem), was found to provide approximately optimal perceptual encoding of grays.

The following illustration shows the difference between a scale with linearly-increasing encoded luminance signal (linear gamma-compressed luma input) and a scale with linearly-increasing intensity scale (linear luminance output).

On most displays (those with gamma of about 2.2), one can observe that the linear-intensity scale has a large jump in perceived brightness between the intensity values 0.0 and 0.1, while the steps at the higher end of the scale are hardly perceptible. The gamma-encoded scale, which has a nonlinearly-increasing intensity, will show much more even steps in perceived brightness.

A CRT, for example, converts a video signal to light in a nonlinear way, because the electron gun&#x27;s intensity (brightness) as a function of applied video voltage is nonlinear. The light intensity &quot;I&quot; is related to the source voltage &quot;V&quot;s according to
: formula_9
where &quot;γ&quot; is the Greek letter gamma. For a CRT, the gamma that relates brightness to voltage is usually in the range 2.35 to 2.55; video look-up tables in computers usually adjust the system gamma to the range 1.8 to 2.2, which is in the region that makes a uniform encoding difference give approximately uniform perceptual brightness difference, as illustrated in the diagram at the top of this section.

For simplicity, consider the example of a monochrome CRT. In this case, when a video signal of 0.5 (representing a mid-gray) is fed to the display, the intensity or brightness is about 0.22 (resulting in a mid-gray, about 22% the intensity of white). Pure black (0.0) and pure white (1.0) are the only shades that are unaffected by gamma.

To compensate for this effect, the inverse transfer function (gamma correction) is sometimes applied to the video signal so that the end-to-end response is linear. In other words, the transmitted signal is deliberately distorted so that, after it has been distorted again by the display device, the viewer sees the correct brightness. The inverse of the function above is
: formula_10
where &quot;V&quot;c is the corrected voltage, and &quot;V&quot;s is the source voltage, for example, from an image sensor that converts photocharge linearly to a voltage. In our CRT example 1/&quot;γ&quot; is 1/2.2 ≈ 0.45.

A color CRT receives three video signals (red, green, and blue) and in general each color has its own value of gamma, denoted &quot;γ&quot;&quot;R&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;&quot;G&quot; or &quot;γ&quot;&quot;B&quot;. However, in simple display systems, a single value of &quot;γ&quot; is used for all three colors.

Other display devices have different values of gamma: for example, a Game Boy Advance display has a gamma between 3 and 4 depending on lighting conditions. In LCDs such as those on laptop computers, the relation between the signal voltage &quot;V&quot;s and the intensity &quot;I&quot; is very nonlinear and cannot be described with gamma value. However, such displays apply a correction onto the signal voltage in order to approximately get a standard behavior. In NTSC television recording, .

The power-law function, or its inverse, has a slope of infinity at zero. This leads to problems in converting from and to a gamma colorspace. For this reason most formally defined colorspaces such as sRGB will define a straight-line segment near zero and add raising (where &quot;K&quot; is a constant) to a power so the curve has continuous slope. This straight line does not represent what the CRT does, but does make the rest of the curve more closely match the effect of ambient light on the CRT. In such expressions the exponent is &quot;not&quot; the gamma; for instance, the sRGB function uses a power of 2.4 in it, but more closely resembles a power-law function with an exponent of 2.2, without a linear portion.

==Methods to perform display gamma correction in computing==
Up to four elements can be manipulated in order to achieve gamma encoding to correct the image to be shown on a typical 2.2- or 1.8-gamma computer display:
* The pixel&#x27;s intensity values in a given image file; that is, the binary pixel values are stored in the file in such way that they represent the light intensity via gamma-compressed values instead of a linear encoding. This is done systematically with digital video files (as those in a DVD movie), in order to minimize the gamma-decoding step while playing, and maximize image quality for the given storage. Similarly, pixel values in standard image file formats are usually gamma-compensated, either for sRGB gamma (or equivalent, an approximation of typical of legacy monitor gammas), or according to some gamma specified by metadata such as an ICC profile. If the encoding gamma does not match the reproduction system&#x27;s gamma, further correction may be done, either on display or to create a modified image file with a different profile.
* The rendering software writes gamma-encoded pixel binary values directly to the video memory (when highcolor/truecolor modes are used) or in the CLUT hardware registers (when indexed color modes are used) of the display adapter. They drive digital-to-analog converters (DAC) which output the proportional voltages to the display. For example, when using 24-bit RGB color (8 bits per channel), writing a value of 128 (rounded midpoint of the 0–255 byte range) in video memory it outputs the proportional voltage to the display, which it is shown darker due to the monitor behavior. Alternatively, to achieve intensity, a gamma-encoded look-up table can be applied to write a value near to 187 instead of 128 by the rendering software.
* Modern display adapters have dedicated calibrating CLUTs, which can be loaded once with the appropriate gamma-correction look-up table in order to modify the encoded signals digitally before the DACs that output voltages to the monitor. Setting up these tables to be correct is called &quot;hardware calibration&quot;.
* Some modern monitors allow the user to manipulate their gamma behavior (as if it were merely another brightness/contrast-like setting), encoding the input signals by themselves before they are displayed on screen. This is also a &quot;calibration by hardware&quot; technique but it is performed on the analog electric signals instead of remapping the digital values, as in the previous cases.

In a correctly calibrated system, each component will have a specified gamma for its input and/or output encodings. Stages may change the gamma to correct for different requirements, and finally the output device will do gamma decoding or correction as needed, to get to a linear intensity domain. All the encoding and correction methods can be arbitrarily superimposed, without mutual knowledge of this fact among the different elements; if done incorrectly, these conversions can lead to highly distorted results, but if done correctly as dictated by standards and conventions will lead to a properly functioning system.

In a typical system, for example from camera through JPEG file to display, the role of gamma correction will involve several cooperating parts. The camera encodes its rendered image into the JPEG file using one of the standard gamma values such as 2.2, for storage and transmission. The display computer may use a color management engine to convert to a different color space (such as older Macintosh&#x27;s color space) before putting pixel values into its video memory. The monitor may do its own gamma correction to match the CRT gamma to that used by the video system. Coordinating the components via standard interfaces with default standard gamma values makes it possible to get such system properly configured.

==Simple monitor tests==
This procedure is useful for making a monitor display images approximately correctly, on systems in which profiles are not used (for example, the Firefox browser prior to version 3.0 and many others) or in systems that assume untagged source images are in the sRGB colorspace.

In the test pattern, the intensity of each solid color bar is intended to be the average of the intensities in the surrounding dotted dither; therefore, ideally, the solid areas and the dithers should appear equally bright in a system properly adjusted to the indicated gamma.

Normally a graphics card has contrast and brightness control and a transmissive LCD monitor has contrast, brightness, and backlight control. Graphics card and monitor contrast and brightness have an influence on effective gamma, and should not be changed after gamma correction is completed.

The top two bars of the test image help to set correct contrast and brightness values. There are eight three-digit numbers in each bar. A good monitor with proper calibration shows the six numbers on the right in both bars, a cheap monitor shows only four numbers.

Given a desired display-system gamma, if the observer sees the same brightness in the checkered part and in the homogeneous part of every colored area, then the gamma correction is approximately correct. In many cases the gamma correction values for the primary colors are slightly different.

Setting the color temperature or white point is the next step in monitor adjustment.

Before gamma correction the desired gamma and color temperature should be set using the monitor controls. Using the controls for gamma, contrast and brightness, the gamma correction on an LCD can only be done for one specific vertical viewing angle, which implies one specific horizontal line on the monitor, at one specific brightness and contrast level. An ICC profile allows one to adjust the monitor for several brightness levels. The quality (and price) of the monitor determines how much deviation of this operating point still gives a satisfactory gamma correction. Twisted nematic (TN) displays with 6-bit color depth per primary color have lowest quality. In-plane switching (IPS) displays with typically 8-bit color depth are better. Good monitors have 10-bit color depth, have hardware color management and allow hardware calibration with a tristimulus colorimeter. Often a 6bit plus FRC panel is sold as 8bit and a 8bit plus FRC panel is sold as 10bit. FRC is no true replacement for more bits. The 24-bit and 32-bit color depth formats have 8 bits per primary color.

With Microsoft Windows 7 and above the user can set the gamma correction through the display color calibration tool dccw.exe or other programs. These programs create an ICC profile file and load it as default. This makes color management easy. Increase the gamma slider in the dccw program until the last colored area, often the green color, has the same brightness in checkered and homogeneous area. Use the color balance or individual colors gamma correction sliders in the gamma correction programs to adjust the two other colors. Some old graphics card drivers do not load the color Look Up Table correctly after waking up from standby or hibernate mode and show wrong gamma. In this case update the graphics card driver.

On some operating systems running the X Window System, one can set the gamma correction factor (applied to the existing gamma value) by issuing the command codice_1 for setting gamma correction factor to 0.9, and codice_2 for querying current value of that factor (the default is 1.0). In macOS systems, the gamma and other related screen calibrations are made through the System Preferences.

=== Scaling and blending ===
&quot;Generally,&quot; operations on pixel values should be performed in &quot;linear light&quot; (gamma 1). Eric Brasseur discusses the issue at length and provides test images. They serve to point out a widespread problem: Many programs perform scaling in a color space with gamma, instead of a physically correct linear space. The test images are constructed so as to have a drastically different appearance when downsampled incorrectly. Jonas Berlin has created a &quot;your scaling software sucks/rules&quot; image based on this principle.

In addition to scaling, the problem also applies to other forms of downsampling (scaling down), such as chroma subsampling in JPEG&#x27;s gamma-enabled Y′CbCr. WebP solves this problem by calculating the chroma averages in linear space then converting back to a gamma-enabled space; an iterative solution is used for larger images. The same &quot;sharp YUV&quot; (formerly &quot;smart YUV&quot;) code is used in sjpeg and optionally in AVIF. Kornelski provides a simpler approximation by luma-based weighted average. Alpha compositing, color gradients, and 3D rendering are also affected by this issue.

Paradoxically, when upsampling (scaling up) an image, the result processed in a &quot;wrong&quot; (non-physical) gamma color space is often more aesthetically pleasing. This is because resampling filters with negative lobes like Mitchell–Netravali and Lanczos create ringing artifacts linearly even though human perception is non-linear and better approximated by gamma. (Emulating &quot;stepping back,&quot; which motivates downsampling in linear light (gamma=1), does not apply when upsampling.) A related method of reducing the visibility of ringing artifacts consists of using a sigmoidal light transfer function as pioneered by ImageMagick and GIMP&#x27;s LoHalo filter and adapted to video upsampling by madVR, AviSynth and Mpv.

==Terminology==
The term intensity refers strictly to the amount of light that is emitted per unit of time and per unit of surface, in units of lux. Note, however, that in many fields of science this quantity is called luminous exitance, as opposed to luminous intensity, which is a different quantity. These distinctions, however, are largely irrelevant to gamma compression, which is applicable to any sort of normalized linear intensity-like scale.

&quot;Luminance&quot; can mean several things even within the context of video and imaging:
* &quot;luminance&quot; is the photometric brightness of an object (in units of cd/m2), taking into account the wavelength-dependent sensitivity of the human eye (the photopic curve);
* &quot;relative luminance&quot; is the luminance relative to a white level, used in a color-space encoding;
* &quot;luma&quot; is the encoded video brightness signal, i.e., similar to the signal voltage &quot;V&quot;&quot;S&quot;.

One contrasts relative luminance in the sense of color (no gamma compression) with luma in the sense of video (with gamma compression), and denote relative luminance by &quot;Y&quot; and luma by &quot;Y&quot;′, the prime symbol (′) denoting gamma compression.
Note that luma is not directly calculated from luminance, it is the (somewhat arbitrary) weighted sum of gamma compressed RGB components.

Likewise, &quot;brightness&quot; is sometimes applied to various measures, including light levels, though it more properly applies to a subjective visual attribute.

Gamma correction is a type of power law function whose exponent is the Greek letter gamma (&quot;γ&quot;). It should not be confused with the mathematical Gamma function. The lower case gamma, &quot;γ&quot;, is a parameter of the former; the upper case letter, Γ, is the name of (and symbol used for) the latter (as in Γ(&quot;x&quot;)). To use the word &quot;function&quot; in conjunction with gamma correction, one may avoid confusion by saying &quot;generalized power law function&quot;.

Without context, a value labeled gamma might be either the encoding or the decoding value. Caution must be taken to correctly interpret the value as that to be applied-to-compensate or to be compensated-by-applying its inverse. In common parlance, in many occasions the decoding value (as 2.2) is employed as if it were the encoding value, instead of its inverse (1/2.2 in this case), which is the &quot;real&quot; value that must be applied to encode gamma.

<doc id="68468" wikidata="Q936066" url="?curid=68468" title="Dune buggy">
<text>A dune buggy — also known as a beach buggy — is a recreational off-road vehicle with large wheels, and wide tires, designed for use on sand dunes, beaches, off-road or desert recreation. The design is usually a topless vehicle with a rear-mounted engine. A dune buggy can be created by modifying an existing vehicle or custom-building a new vehicle.

== Design ==
Dune buggies are typically created by modifying an existing road vehicle, while sandrails are built from the ground up as a custom vehicle.

=== Beetle-based buggies ===
For dune buggies built on the chassis of a rear-engined existing vehicle, the Volkswagen Beetle has been most commonly used as the basis for the buggy, though conversions were made from other rear-engined cars (such as the Corvair and Renault Dauphine). The model is nicknamed Bug, lending partial inspiration to the term &quot;buggy.&quot; The Beetle platform chassis was used because the rear engine layout improves traction, the air-cooled engine avoids the complexities and failure points associated with a water-cooled engine, the Beetle&#x27;s front torsion bar suspension was not only considered cheap and robust, but it was also extremely easy to alter and adjust its ride-height. Furthermore, spare parts — and donor vehicles themselves — were cheap and readily available. While early dune buggy conversions were left with no body, or featured custom bodies of sheet metal (such as the EMPI Sportsters and similar buggies), glass-reinforced plastic (fiberglass) bodies, developed in the 1960s, have become the standard image of the modern buggy, and come in many shapes and sizes.

The original fiberglass dune buggy was the 1964 &quot;Meyers Manx&quot; built by Bruce Meyers. Bruce Meyers designed his fiberglass bodies as a &quot;kit car&quot;, using the Volkswagen Beetle chassis. Many other companies worldwide have been inspired by the Manx, making similar bodies and kits. These types of dune buggies are known as &quot;clones&quot;.

=== Sandrail ===

A sandrail is a lightweight vehicle similar to a dune buggy, but designed specifically for operation on open sand.

Sandrails are usually built as a spaceframe by welding steel tubes together. The name sandrail is due to the frame &quot;rails&quot; present. The advantage of this method is that the fabricator can change fundamental parts of the vehicle (usually the suspension and addition of a built-in roll cage). Sandrails, as per dune buggies, often have the engine located behind the driver. Sizes can vary from a small-engine one-seat size to four-seat vehicles with eight or more cylinders.

A similar, more recent generation of off-road vehicle, often similar in appearance to a sandrail, but designed for a different use, is the &quot;off road go-kart&quot;. The difference may be little more than fitting all-terrain tires instead of sand tires and the much smaller size of the engine.

== Military use ==
Because of the advantages a buggy can afford on some terrain, they are also used by the military.

The buggies built for the United States military used to be called Desert Patrol Vehicles (DPV) or Fast Attack Vehicles (FAV), and with the latest improvements are known as Light Strike Vehicles (LSV). They are used by United States Navy SEALs, the SAS, and other forces. Among the dune buggies used by the United States military is the Chenowth Advanced Light Strike Vehicle. The US Border Patrol also uses this (although it is not a military organization).

In the United Kingdom, the SAS have used cut-down, light-weight all terrain vehicles for secret special operations &quot;behind the lines&quot; since early in World War II. A buggy was used by the British Special Air Service (SAS) forces during the Gulf War. A long-range special desert operations vehicle was developed in 1992 and nicknamed &quot;pink panthers&quot; because of their color, but these were only modified Land Rovers.

<text>Laparoscopy () is an operation performed in the abdomen or pelvis using small incisions (usually 0.5–1.5 cm) with the aid of a camera. The laparoscope aids diagnosis or therapeutic interventions with a few small cuts in the abdomen.

Laparoscopic surgery, also called minimally invasive procedure, bandaid surgery, or keyhole surgery, is a modern surgical technique. There are a number of advantages to the patient with laparoscopic surgery versus an exploratory laparotomy. These include reduced pain due to smaller incisions, reduced hemorrhaging, and shorter recovery time. The key element is the use of a laparoscope, a long fiber optic cable system that allows viewing of the affected area by snaking the cable from a more distant, but more easily accessible location.

Laparoscopic surgery includes operations within the abdominal or pelvic cavities, whereas keyhole surgery performed on the thoracic or chest cavity is called thoracoscopic surgery. Specific surgical instruments used in laparoscopic surgery include obstetrical forceps, scissors, probes, dissectors, hooks, and retractors. Laparoscopic and thoracoscopic surgery belong to the broader field of endoscopy. The first laparoscopic procedure was performed by German surgeon Georg Kelling in 1901.

==Types of laparoscopes==

There are two types of laparoscope:

# A telescopic rod lens system, usually connected to a video camera (single-chip CCD or three-chip CCD)
# A digital laparoscope where a miniature digital video camera is placed at the end of the laparoscope, eliminating the rod lens system

The mechanism mentioned in the second type is mainly used to improve the image quality of flexible endoscopes, replacing conventional fiberscopes. Nevertheless, laparoscopes are rigid endoscopes. Rigidity is required in clinical practice. The rod-lens-based laparoscopes dominate overwhelmingly in practice, due to their fine optical resolution (50 μm typically, dependent on the aperture size used in the objective lens), and the image quality can be better than that of the digital camera if necessary. The second type of laparoscope is very rare in the laparoscope market and in hospitals.

Also attached is a fiber optic cable system connected to a &quot;cold&quot; light source (halogen or xenon) to illuminate the operative field, which is inserted through a 5 mm or 10 mm cannula or trocar. The abdomen is usually insufflated with carbon dioxide gas as the safety, harms, and benefits of other gasses (e.g., helium, argon, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, and room air) is uncertain. This elevates the abdominal wall above the internal organs to create a working and viewing space. CO2 is used because it is common to the human body and can be absorbed by tissue and removed by the respiratory system. It is also non-flammable, which is important because electrosurgical devices are commonly used in laparoscopic procedures.

==Procedures==
===Patient position===
During the laparoscopic procedure, the position of the patient is either in Trendelenburg position or in reverse Trendelenburg. These positions have an effect on cardiopulmonary function. In Trendelenburg&#x27;s position, there is an increased preload due to an increase in the venous return from lower extremities. This position results in cephalic shifting of the viscera, which accentuates the pressure on the diaphragm. In the case of reverse Trendelenburg position, pulmonary function tends to improve as there is a caudal shifting of viscera, which improves tidal volume by a decrease in the pressure on the diaphragm. This position also decreases the preload on the heart and causes a decrease in the venous return leading to hypotension. The pooling of blood in the lower extremities increases the stasis and predisposes the patient to develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

===Gallbladder===
Rather than a minimum 20 cm incision as in traditional (open) cholecystectomy, four incisions of 0.5–1.0 cm, or, beginning in the second decade of the 21st century, a single incision of 1.5–2.0 cm, will be sufficient to perform a laparoscopic removal of a gallbladder.
Since the gallbladder is similar to a small balloon that stores and releases bile, it can usually be removed from the abdomen by suctioning out the bile and then removing the deflated gallbladder through the 1 cm incision at the patient&#x27;s navel.
The length of postoperative stay in the hospital is minimal,
and most patients can be safely discharged from the hospital the same day.

===Colon and kidney===
In certain advanced laparoscopic procedures, where the specimen removed is too large to pull through a trocar site (as is done with gallbladders), an incision larger than 10 mm must be made. The most common of these procedures are removal of all or part of the colon (colectomy), or removal of the kidney (nephrectomy). Some surgeons perform these procedures completely laparoscopically, making the larger incision toward the end of the procedure for specimen removal, or, in the case of a colectomy, to also prepare the remaining healthy bowel to be reconnected (create an anastomosis). Many other surgeons feel that since they will have to make a larger incision for specimen removal anyway, they might as well use this incision to have their hand in the operative field during the procedure to aid as a retractor, dissector, and to be able to feel differing tissue densities (palpate), as they would in open surgery. This technique is called hand-assist laparoscopy. Since they will still be working with scopes and other laparoscopic instruments, CO2 will have to be maintained in the patient&#x27;s abdomen, so a device known as a hand access port (a sleeve with a seal that allows passage of the hand) must be used. Surgeons who choose this hand-assist technique feel it reduces operative time significantly versus the straight laparoscopic approach. It also gives them more options in dealing with unexpected adverse events (e.g., uncontrolled bleeding) that may otherwise require creating a much larger incision and converting to a fully open surgical procedure.

Conceptually, the laparoscopic approach is intended to minimise post-operative pain and speed up recovery times, while maintaining an enhanced visual field for surgeons. Due to improved patient outcomes in the early 21st century, laparoscopic surgery has been adopted by various surgical sub-specialties, including gastrointestinal surgery (including bariatric procedures for morbid obesity), gynecologic surgery, and urology. Based on numerous prospective randomized controlled trials, the approach has proven to be beneficial in reducing post-operative morbidities such as wound infections and incisional hernias (especially in morbidly obese patients), and is now deemed safe when applied to surgery for cancers such as cancer of colon.

The restricted vision, the difficulty in handling of the instruments (new hand-eye coordination skills are needed), the lack of tactile perception, and the limited working area are factors adding to the technical complexity of this surgical approach. For these reasons, minimally invasive surgery has emerged as a highly competitive new sub-specialty within various fields of surgery. Surgical residents who wish to focus on this area of surgery gain additional laparoscopic surgery training during one or two years of fellowship after completing their basic surgical residency. In OB-GYN residency programs, the average laparoscopy-to-laparotomy quotient (LPQ) is 0.55.

=== In veterinary medicine ===
Laparoscopic techniques have also been developed in the field of veterinary medicine. Due to the relatively high cost of the equipment required, it has not become commonplace in most traditional practices today but rather limited to specialty practices. Many of the same surgeries performed in humans can be applied to animal cases – everything from an egg-bound tortoise to a German Shepherd can benefit from MIS. A paper published in JAVMA (Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association) in 2005 showed that dogs spayed laparoscopically experienced significantly less pain (65%) than those that were spayed with traditional &quot;open&quot; methods. Arthroscopy, thoracoscopy, and cystoscopy are all performed in veterinary medicine today.

===Advantages===
There are a number of advantages to the patient with laparoscopic surgery versus an open procedure. These include:
* Reduced hemorrhaging, which reduces the chance of needing a blood transfusion.
* Smaller incision, which reduces pain and shortens recovery time, as well as resulting in less post-operative scarring.
* Less pain, leading to less pain medication needed.
* Use of regional anesthesia (with the recommendation of using a combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia) for laparoscopic surgery, as opposed to general anesthesia required for many non-laparoscopic procedures, can produce fewer complications and quicker recovery.
* Although procedure times are usually slightly longer, hospital stay is less, and often with a same day discharge which leads to a faster return to everyday living.
* Reduced exposure of internal organs to possible external contaminants, thereby reduced risk of acquiring infections.

Although laparoscopy in adults is widely accepted, its advantages in children are questioned. Benefits of laparoscopy appear to recede with younger age. Efficacy of laparoscopy is inferior to open surgery in certain conditions such as pyloromyotomy for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Although laparoscopic appendectomy has less wound problems than open surgery, the former is associated with more intra-abdominal abscesses.

===Disadvantages===
While laparoscopic surgery is clearly advantageous in terms of patient outcomes, the procedure is more difficult from the surgeon&#x27;s perspective when compared to conventional, open surgery:
* Laparoscopic surgery requires pneumoperitoneum for adequate visualization and operative manipulation.
* The surgeon has a limited range of motion at the surgical site, resulting in a loss of dexterity.
* Poor depth perception.
* Surgeons must use tools to interact with tissue rather than manipulate it directly with their hands. This results in an inability to accurately judge how much force is applied to tissue and higher risk of damaging tissue by applying more force than necessary. This limitation also reduces tactile sensation, making it more difficult for the surgeon to feel tissue (sometimes an important diagnostic tool, such as when palpating for tumors) and making delicate operations such as tying sutures more difficult.
* The tool endpoints move in the opposite direction to the surgeon&#x27;s hands due to the pivot point, making laparoscopic surgery a non-intuitive motor skill that is difficult to learn. This is called the &quot;fulcrum effect&quot;.
* Some surgeries (carpal tunnel for instance) generally turn out better for the patient when the area can be opened up, allowing the surgeon to see the surrounding physiology, to better address the issue at hand. In this regard, keyhole surgery can be a disadvantage.

==Risks==
Some of the risks are briefly described below:
* The major problems during laparoscopic surgery are related to the cardiopulmonary effect of pneumoperitoneum, systemic carbon dioxide absorption, venous gas embolism, unintentional injuries to intra-abdominal structures and patient positioning.
* The most significant risks are from trocar injuries during insertion into the abdominal cavity, as the trocar is typically inserted blindly. Injuries include abdominal wall hematoma, umbilical hernias, umbilical wound infection, and penetration of blood vessels or small or large bowel. The risk of such injuries is increased in patients who have a low body mass index or have a history of prior abdominal surgery. While these injuries are rare, significant complications can occur, and they are primarily related to the umbilical insertion site. Vascular injuries can result in hemorrhage that may be life-threatening. Injuries to the bowel can cause a delayed peritonitis. It is very important that these injuries be recognized as early as possible.
* In oncologic laparoscopic procedures there is a risk of port site metastases, especially in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. This incidence of iatrogenic dissemination of cancer might be reduced with special measures as trocar site protection and midline placement of trocars.
* Some patients have sustained electrical burns unseen by surgeons who are working with electrodes that leak current into surrounding tissue. The resulting injuries can result in perforated organs and can also lead to peritonitis.
* About 20% of patients undergo hypothermia during surgery and peritoneal trauma due to increased exposure to cold, dry gases during insufflation. The use of surgical humidification therapy, which is the use of heated and humidified CO2 for insufflation, has been shown to reduce this risk.
* Not all of the introduced into the abdominal cavity is removed through the incisions during surgery. Gas tends to rise, and when a pocket of CO2 rises in the abdomen, it pushes against the diaphragm (the muscle that separates the abdominal from the thoracic cavities and facilitates breathing), and can exert pressure on the phrenic nerve. This produces a sensation of pain that may extend to the patient&#x27;s shoulders in about 80% of women for example. In all cases, the pain is transient, as the body tissues will absorb the CO2 and eliminate it through respiration.
* Coagulation disorders and dense adhesions (scar tissue) from previous abdominal surgery may pose added risk for laparoscopic surgery and are considered relative contra-indications for this approach.
* Intra-abdominal adhesion formation is a risk associated with both laparoscopic and open surgery and remains a significant, unresolved problem. Adhesions are fibrous deposits that connect tissue to organ post surgery. Generally, they occur in 50-100% of all abdominal surgeries, with the risk of developing adhesions the same for both procedures. Complications of adhesions include chronic pelvic pain, bowel obstruction, and female infertility. In particular, small bowel obstruction poses the most significant problem. The use of surgical humidification therapy during laparoscopic surgery may minimise the incidence of adhesion formation. Other techniques to reduce adhesion formation include the use of physical barriers such as films or gels, or broad-coverage fluid agents to separate tissues during healing following surgery.
* The gas used to make space and the smoke generated during surgical procedures can leak into the operating room through or around access devices as well as instruments. The gas plume can pollute the airspace shared by the operating team and patient with particles and potentially pathogens, including viral particles.

==Robotic laparoscopic surgery==
In recent years, electronic tools have been developed to aid surgeons. Some of the features include:
* Visual magnification — use of a large viewing screen improves visibility
* Stabilization — Electromechanical damping of vibrations, due to machinery or shaky human hands
* Simulators — use of specialized virtual reality training tools to improve physicians&#x27; proficiency in surgery
* Reduced number of incisions

Robotic surgery has been touted as a solution to underdeveloped nations, whereby a single central hospital can operate several remote machines at distant locations. The potential for robotic surgery has had a strong military interest as well, with the intention of providing mobile medical care while keeping trained doctors safe from battle. 

In January 2022, a robot performed the first ever successful laparoscopic surgery without the help of a human. The robot performed the surgery on the soft tissue of a pig. It succeeded at intestinal anastomosis, a procedure that involves connecting two ends of an intestine. The robot, named the Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR), was designed by a team of Johns Hopkins University researchers.

==Non-robotic hand-guided assistance systems==
There are also user-friendly nonrobotic assistance systems that are single-hand guided devices with a high potential to save time and money. These assistance devices are not bound by the restrictions of common medical robotic systems. The systems enhance the manual possibilities of the surgeon and his/her team, regarding the need of replacing static holding force during the intervention.

With laparoscopy providing tissue diagnosis and helping to achieve the final diagnosis without any significant complication and less operative time, it can be safely concluded that diagnostic laparoscopy is a safe, quick, and effective adjunct to non‑surgical diagnostic modalities, for establishing a conclusive diagnosis, but whether it will replace imaging studies as a primary modality for diagnosis needs more evidence.

==History==

It is difficult to credit one individual with the pioneering of the laparoscopic approach. In 1901, Georg Kelling of Dresden, Germany, performed the first laparoscopic procedure in dogs, and, in 1910, Hans Christian Jacobaeus of Sweden performed the first laparoscopic operation in humans.

In the ensuing several decades, numerous individuals refined and popularized the approach further for laparoscopy. The advent of computer chip-based television cameras was a seminal event in the field of laparoscopy. This technological innovation provided the means to project a magnified view of the operative field onto a monitor and, at the same time, freed both the operating surgeon&#x27;s hands, thereby facilitating performance of complex laparoscopic procedures.

The first publication on modern diagnostic laparoscopy by Raoul Palmer appeared in 1947, followed by the publication of Hans Frangenheim and Kurt Semm, who both practised hysteroscopy from the mid-1970s.

Patrick Steptoe, one of the pioneers of IVF, was important in popularizing laparoscopy in the UK. He published a textbook, &quot;Laparoscopy in Gynaecology,&quot; in 1967.

In 1972, H. Courtenay Clarke invented, published, patented, presented, and recorded on film laparoscopic surgery, with instruments he invented and were marketed by the Ven Instrument Company of Buffalo, New York. He was the first to perform a surgical laparoscopic process with standard sutures and simple instruments This was meant to facilitate the application of laparoscopic surgery to all economic sectors by avoiding expensive materials and devices.

In 1975, Tarasconi, from the Department of Ob-Gyn of the University of Passo Fundo Medical School (Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil), started his experience with organ resection by laparoscopy (Salpingectomy), first reported in the Third AAGL Meeting, Hyatt Regency Atlanta, November 1976 and later published in The Journal of Reproductive Medicine in 1981.
This laparoscopic surgical procedure was the first laparoscopic organ resection reported in medical literature. 

In 1981, Semm, from the gynecological clinic of Kiel University, Germany, performed the first laparoscopic appendectomy. Following his lecture on laparoscopic appendectomy, the president of the German Surgical Society wrote to the Board of Directors of the German Gynecological Society suggesting suspension of Semm from medical practice. Subsequently, Semm submitted a paper on laparoscopic appendectomy to the &quot;American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology&quot;, at first rejected as unacceptable for publication on the grounds that the technique reported on was &quot;unethical,&quot; but finally published in the journal &quot;Endoscopy&quot;. The abstract of his paper on endoscopic appendectomy can be found at the journal site.

Semm established several standard procedures that were regularly performed, such as ovarian cyst enucleation, myomectomy, treatment of ectopic pregnancy and finally laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (also termed cervical intra-fascial Semm hysterectomy). He also developed a medical instrument company Wisap in Munich, Germany, which still produces various endoscopic instruments. In 1985, he constructed the pelvi-trainer = laparo-trainer, a practical surgical model whereby colleagues could practice laparoscopic techniques. Semm published over 1000 papers in various journals. He also produced over 30 endoscopic films and more than 20,000 colored slides to teach and inform interested colleagues about his technique. His first atlas, &quot;More Details on Pelviscopy and Hysteroscopy&quot; was published in 1976, a slide atlas on pelviscopy, hysteroscopy, and fetoscopy in 1979, and his books on gynecological endoscopic surgery in German, English, and many other languages in 1984, 1987, and 2002.

In 1985, Erich Mühe, professor of surgery in Germany, performed the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Afterward, laparoscopy gained rapid acceptance for non-gynecologic applications. The first video-assisted laparoscopic surgery was performed in 1987, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Before this time, the operating field was visualised by surgeons directly via a laparoscope. 

In 1987, Alfred Cuschieri performed the first minimally invasive surgery in the UK with his team at Ninewells Hospital after working with multiple researchers from across the world, including Patrick Steptoe. Cuschieri took advantage of smaller cameras to perform operations with smaller cuts and shorter recovery times. After some controversy and patient deaths, new laparoscopic training centres were set up as most surgeons lacked the necessary specialised training to perform laparoscopic surgery. The first opened in Dundee in 1991 and became the Cuschieri Skills Centre at Ninewells Hospital in 2004. As of 2008, 40 specialist centres around the world base their laparoscopic training on the Cuschieri Skills Centre.

Prior to Mühe, the only specialty performing laparoscopy on a widespread basis was gynecology, mostly for relatively short, simple procedures such as a diagnostic laparoscopy or tubal ligation. The introduction in 1990 of a laparoscopic clip applier with twenty automatically advancing clips (rather than a single load clip applier that would have to be taken out, reloaded and reintroduced for each clip application) made general surgeons more comfortable with making the leap to laparoscopic cholecystectomies ( gall bladder removal). On the other hand, some surgeons continue to use the single clip appliers as they save as much as $200 per case for the patient, detract nothing from the quality of the clip ligation, and add only seconds to case lengths. Both laparoscopy tubal ligations and cholecystectomies may be performed using suturing and tying, thus further reducing the expensive cost of single and multiclips (when compared to suture). Once again this may increase case lengths but costs are greatly reduced (ideal for developing countries) and widespread accidents of loose clips are eliminated.

The first transatlantic surgery performed was a laparoscopic gallbladder removal in 2001. The first robotic advanced pediatric surgery series were performed overseas in Egypt at Cairo University. Remote surgeries and robotic surgeries have since become more common and are typically laparoscopic procedures.

== Surgical associations ==
There are many International and American Surgical Associations involved in surgical education and training for laparoscopy, thoracoscopy and many minimally invasive procedures for both adults and pediatrics. These societies include:

=== For adults ===

* Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons
* Society of Laparoscopic &amp; Robotic Surgeons
* World Association of Laparoscopic Surgeons

=== For pediatric surgery ===

* International Pediatric Endosurgery Group
* European Society of Paediatric Endoscopic Surgeons
* British Association Of Paediatric Endoscopic Surgeons

==Gynecological diagnosis==

In gynecology, diagnostic laparoscopy may be used to inspect the outside of the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, as, for example, in the diagnosis of female infertility. Usually, one incision is placed near the navel and a second near the pubic hairline. A special type of laparoscope called a fertiloscope, which is modified for application, can be used. A dye test may be performed to detect any blockage in the reproductive tract, wherein a dark blue dye is passed up through the cervix and is followed with the laparoscope through its passage out into the fallopian tubes to the ovaries.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1959 was the fourth edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest, held on Wednesday 11 March 1959 at the in Cannes, France, and hosted by French television presenter Jacqueline Joubert. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RTF), the contest, originally known as the  (), was held in France following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;, performed by André Claveau.

In total eleven countries participated in the contest, with making its first appearance and the returning after their absence the previous year. , however, decided not to participate after competing in all former editions.

The winner was the with the song &quot;, performed by Teddy Scholten, composed by Dick Schallies and written by Willy van Hemert. This was the Netherlands&#x27; second victory in the contest, having also won in , and also marked the first time a country had won the contest more than once. Van Hemert also became the first individual to win twice, having also written the first Dutch winning song from 1957, &quot;. The United Kingdom placed second, marking the first of a record sixteen times that the country would go on to finish as contest runners-up, while placed third.

== Location ==

The event took place in Cannes, France, following the nation&#x27;s victory at the in Hilversum, Netherlands, with the song &quot;, performed by André Claveau. The selected venue was the , built in 1949 to host the Cannes Film Festival and located on the along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Due to the growth in the film festival a new building bearing the same name was opened in 1982, with the original building renamed as the .

This marked the second occasion in which the previous year&#x27;s winning country organised the event, and the first time in which the winning country was given first choice at hosting the following year&#x27;s event, as the rights to host the 1958 contest were only awarded to the Netherlands after all other countries declined.

A garden space with plants from Southern France was installed in front of the building for the contest, and the flags of the participating nations were raised on the roof. The audience comprised 1,500 invited guests.

Additional events during the contest week included a supper for the participating delegations on behalf of the city of Cannes held on the evening following the contest in the of the city&#x27;s .

== Participating countries ==

A total of eleven countries competed in the contest, with making its first appearance and the returning after a one year absence. The United Kingdom&#x27;s absence from the 1958 contest is generally reported to have been due to the country&#x27;s poor result in , but their return coincided with the international success of &quot;&quot;, the Italian entry from the previous year&#x27;s contest, and the appointment of Eric Maschwitz as Head of Light Entertainment at the BBC. Beginning with this event the United Kingdom holds the record for the longest string of consecutive appearances in the Eurovision Song Contest, appearing in every subsequent contest final . was absent from the event, having participated in all previous contests, and appears to have decided against participating late in the preparations for the contest as the country was listed among the participants in several radio and television listings.

Among this year&#x27;s participants, two artists had previously competed in the contest. Birthe Wilke had placed third for , performing &quot; alongside Gustav Winckler, and Domenico Modugno had placed third for with &quot;.


== Production and format ==
The contest was organised and broadcast by the French public broadcaster (RTF), with serving as producer and director, Gérard Dubois serving as designer, and Franck Pourcel serving as musical director and leading the . Each country was allowed to nominate their own musical director to lead the orchestra during the performance of their country&#x27;s entry, with the host musical director also conducting for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor.

As in the 1957 and 1958 contests, each country, participating through a single EBU member broadcaster, was represented by one song performed by up to two people on stage. The results of the event were determined through jury voting, with each country&#x27;s jury containing ten individuals who each gave one vote to their favourite song, with no abstentions allowed and with jurors unable to vote for their own country. One rule change implemented for this contest specified that individuals employed in the music industry were no longer allowed to be included among the national juries.

Dubois&#x27; stage design was inspired by the era of Louis XIV. The stage featured three revolving platforms, each of which was segmented into four, similar to a revolving door, to include various backdrops. These backdrops were specific to each of the participating countries and featured scenery or objects associated with that country.

The draw to determine the running order took place on 9 March 1959. A few days prior to the contest, hotel and shop owners in Cannes complained that the contest was covered and advertised too sparsely by RTF and subsequently feared that too few tourists would come to Cannes. In contrast, the Cannes , which was involved in the organisation of the contest, believed that the broadcast of images from Cannes to many European households would have a significant impact on tourism in the weeks to follow.

== Contest overview ==

The contest was held on 11 March 1959 at 21:00 (CET) and lasted 1 hour and 12 minutes. The event was hosted by French television presenter Jacqueline Joubert.

The prelude of Charpentier&#x27;s &quot;Te Deum&quot;, the theme music of Eurovision broadcasts, was played as opening act by the orchestra under the direction of Franck Pourcel.

The winner was the represented by the song &quot;, composed by , written by Willy van Hemert and performed by Teddy Scholten. The Netherlands became the first country to achieve two victories in the event, and Van Hemert became the first individual to win the contest twice, after previously providing lyrics for the Netherlands&#x27; winner in 1957, &quot;. The United Kingdom&#x27;s result was the first of sixteen British entries to finish in second place, a contest record .

Alongside the traditional reprise performance of the winning song, the second- and third-placed songs were also performed again, for the first and only time at the contest. The prize awarded to the winning songwriters, taking the form of an engraved medallion, was to be handed over during the delegations&#x27; supper following the event, but instead was presented by RTF&#x27;s director of programming to Teddy Scholten at the end of the show.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1959 contest are listed below.
* 

== Detailed voting results ==

The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in reverse order to that which each country performed.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its television network. No official accounts of the viewing figures are known to exist. An estimate given in the press was at least 20 million viewers.

Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. Twelve commentator boxes were installed on the balconies of the auditorium. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the table below.

<text>Karl Adolph Verner (; 7 March 1846 – 5 November 1896) was a Danish linguist. He is remembered today for Verner&#x27;s law, which he published in 1876.

==Biography==
Verner&#x27;s interest in languages was stimulated by reading about the work of Rasmus Christian Rask. He began his university studies in 1864 in Oriental, Germanic, and Slavic languages, and then he served in the army before resuming his studies. He traveled to Russia in December 1871, spending nearly a year learning the language. His first scientific paper was &quot;Nogle Raskiana&quot; (1874). He began to study the accent of Danish and Slavic languages, and he was puzzled by the fact that the Gothic words &quot;fadar&quot; and &quot;broþar&quot; have different consonants after the root vowel. He was preoccupied with the study of accent at the time, so he sought the explanation in that direction which led to the formation of Verner&#x27;s Law. He finished the relevant paper and sent it to Vilhelm Thomsen in 1875; he published it a year later.

Despite his achievement, Verner considered himself only an amateur in German philology. He declined certain offers of professorship, contenting himself to be a librarian in Halle. He was taught by August Leskien, a pioneer of research into sound-change laws, and he applied for the Bopp prize, which he received in 1877. He became a professor in 1888 when he was also elected a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.

<text>Jurassic Park is a 1993 American science fiction action film directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Gerald R. Molen, and starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough. It was written by Michael Crichton and David Koepp, based on Crichton&#x27;s 1990 novel. The film is set on the fictional island of Isla Nublar, off Central America&#x27;s Pacific Coast near Costa Rica, where wealthy businessman John Hammond (Attenborough) and a team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of de-extinct dinosaurs. When industrial sabotage leads to a catastrophic shutdown of the park&#x27;s power facilities and security precautions, a small group of visitors, including Hammond&#x27;s grandchildren, struggle to survive and escape the now perilous island.

Before Crichton&#x27;s novel was published, four studios put in bids for its film rights. With the backing of Universal Pictures, Spielberg acquired the rights for $1.5 million before its publication in 1990. Crichton was hired for an additional $500,000 to adapt the novel for the screen. Koepp wrote the final draft, which left out much of the novel&#x27;s exposition and violence, while making numerous changes to the characters. Filming took place in California and Hawaii from August to November 1992, and post-production lasted until May 1993, supervised by Spielberg in Poland as he filmed &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston&#x27;s team. To showcase the film&#x27;s sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur sounds, Spielberg invested in the creation of DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats. The film was backed by an extensive $65 million marketing campaign, which included licensing deals with over 100 companies.

&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; premiered on June 9, 1993, at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C., and was released on June 11 in the United States. It was a blockbuster hit and went on to gross over $914 million worldwide in its original theatrical run, surpassing Spielberg&#x27;s own &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; to become the highest-grossing film of all time until the release of &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1997. It also remains the highest-grossing film directed by Spielberg to date. The film received critical acclaim, with praise to its special effects, sound design, action sequences, John Williams&#x27;s score, and Spielberg&#x27;s direction. The film won 20 awards, including three Academy Awards for technical achievements in visual effects and sound design. Following its 20th anniversary re-release in 2013, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; became the oldest film in history to surpass $1billion in ticket sales and the 17th overall.

In the years since its release, film critics and industry professionals have often cited &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; as one of the greatest movies in history. Its pioneering use of computer-generated imagery is considered to have paved the way for the visual effects practices of modern cinema. In 2018, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film spawned a multimedia franchise that includes six sequels, video games, theme park attractions, comic books and various merchandise.

==Plot==

Industrialist John Hammond has created Jurassic Park, an animal theme park of cloned dinosaurs, on the island of Isla Nublar, near the coast of Costa Rica. After a &quot;Velociraptor&quot; kills a handler, the park&#x27;s investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand a safety certification. Gennaro invites chaotician Ian Malcolm, and Hammond invites paleontologist Alan Grant and paleobotanist Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see living &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; and &quot;Parasaurolophus&quot;. At the park&#x27;s visitor center, the group learns that the cloning was accomplished by extracting dinosaur DNA from prehistoric mosquitoes preserved in amber. DNA from frogs, among other animals, was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs&#x27; genome.

To prevent breeding, the dinosaurs were made female by direct chromosome manipulation. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and visits the raptor enclosure. During lunch, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the park&#x27;s creation. Malcolm warns of the implications of genetic engineering while Grant and Sattler express uncertainty over the ability of humans and dinosaurs to coexist. Hammond&#x27;s grandchildren, Lex and Tim, join the others for a park tour while Hammond oversees them from the control room. Most of the dinosaurs fail to appear, and the group encounters a sick &quot;Triceratops&quot;. The tour is cut short as a tropical storm approaches. The park employees leave for the mainland on a boat while the visitors return to their railed-electric tour vehicles, except Sattler, who stays behind with the park&#x27;s veterinarian, Doctor Harding, to study the &quot;Triceratops&quot;.

Jurassic Park&#x27;s disgruntled lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, was previously bribed by Lewis Dodgson, a man working for Hammond&#x27;s corporate rival, to steal frozen dinosaur embryos. He deactivates the park&#x27;s security system to access the embryo storage room and stores them inside a container disguised as a Barbasol shaving cream can. Nedry&#x27;s sabotage cuts power to the tour vehicles, stranding them as they near the park&#x27;s &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; paddock. Most of the park&#x27;s electric fences have also been deactivated, allowing the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; to escape and attack the group. After the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; overturns a tour vehicle, it injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro while Grant, Lex, and Tim escape. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island&#x27;s docks, Nedry gets lost in the rain, crashes his Jeep Wrangler and is killed by a venom-spitting &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;.

Sattler helps the game warden Robert Muldoon search for survivors; they find Malcolm just before the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; returns and chases them away. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop and encounter a &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; herd. Back at the visitor center, Sattler convinces Hammond not to recreate the park, as his vision is beyond human control. Grant and the kids discover the broken shells of dinosaur eggs the following morning. Grant concludes that the dinosaurs are breeding, which is possible because of amphibian DNA—animals like West African frogs can change their sex in a single-sex environment, enabling the dinosaurs to breed. The three later encounter a &quot;Gallimimus&quot; stampede being hunted by the &quot;Tyrannosaurus.&quot;

Unable to decipher Nedry&#x27;s code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and chief engineer Ray Arnold decide to reboot the park&#x27;s systems. The group shuts down the park&#x27;s power grid and retreats to an emergency bunker while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head over, discovering the shutdown has released the &quot;Velociraptors&quot;. Muldoon distracts two of them while Sattler turns the power back on before being attacked by the third and discovering Arnold&#x27;s severed arm. At the same time, Muldoon is caught off-guard and killed by a &quot;Velociraptor&quot;.

Grant, Tim, and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler, leaving Tim and Lex inside. The raptors appear and pursue Tim and Lex throughout a kitchen, but they escape, locking one in a freezer before joining Grant and Sattler. The group reaches the control room, and Lex restores the park&#x27;s systems, allowing them to contact Hammond, who calls for help. As they try to leave, they are cornered by the two remaining raptors, but the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; appears and dispatches them while the group flees. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm and they board a helicopter to leave the island.

==Production==
===Development===

Michael Crichton&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was originally conceived as a screenplay in the 1980s, and went through numerous changes before being published as a book. In the late 1970s, a bidding war began for the film rights to Crichton&#x27;s then-upcoming novel &quot;Congo&quot;, which had yet to be made into a film as of 1990. With &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, Crichton hoped to avoid another bidding war and the same outcome by offering the film rights at a fixed price of $1.5 million, as he was primarily concerned with ensuring that a film actually be produced; he was less interested in receiving a top offer.

Crichton submitted the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; manuscript to his publisher in May 1990. Director Steven Spielberg learned of the novel that month while he was discussing a screenplay with Crichton that would become the television series &quot;ER&quot;. Spielberg had a life-long fascination with dinosaurs and expressed interest in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. After reading the galleys, he committed to direct the film adaptation. He liked the novel&#x27;s sense of adventure and its scientific explanation for dinosaur resurrection, saying it provided &quot;a really credible look at how dinosaurs might someday be brought back alongside modern mankind&quot;.

Crichton was represented by an agent at Creative Artists Agency. Spielberg recalled that &quot;the agency got ahold of it; and they, of course, encouraged a bidding war, even though Michael had kind of promised me the book privately.&quot; Major studios bid for the film rights, each with a director in mind. This included Warner Bros. and Tim Burton, Columbia Pictures and Richard Donner, and 20th Century Fox and Joe Dante. Crichton spoke with each director and endorsed Spielberg as the most likely candidate to get the film made, noting it would be &quot;a very difficult picture&quot; and calling Spielberg &quot;arguably the most experienced and most successful director of these kinds of movies&quot;. Universal Pictures, also backing Spielberg as director, acquired the rights in May 1990, less than a week after they were offered for sale and six months before the novel&#x27;s publication.

James Cameron revealed in 2012 he tried to get the rights, only to discover that Spielberg acquired them a few hours prior. Cameron said his version of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; would have been &quot;much nastier&quot;, comparing it with his 1986 film &quot;Aliens&quot;. He realized he was not the right director for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; after seeing the finished product, commending Spielberg for making a film which could be enjoyed by children. Dante also praised it, but disagreed with Spielberg&#x27;s decision to make Hammond more of a protagonist, a departure from the novel.

Storyboards and sketches were already being produced weeks after the rights were acquired. Because of the island setting and abundance of dinosaurs, Spielberg believed it would be advantageous to hire a production designer as soon as possible, choosing Rick Carter about two years before the start of filming. They read the galleys and held many meetings to discuss which scenes would work best in the film adaptation. Spielberg said that with &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, he &quot;was really just trying to make a good sequel to &quot;Jaws&quot;, on land.&quot; He was also heavily inspired by the 1933 film &quot;King Kong&quot;, calling it the &quot;high-water mark&quot; for special effects and for imagining &quot;what it would be like to do a &quot;King Kong&quot; of today.&quot; He cited the 1962 film &quot;Hatari!&quot; as another inspiration, calling it &quot;the high-water mark of man versus the natural in a feature film.&quot; Spielberg described the 1956 film &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot; as the most masterful dinosaur film of his youth, because it made him and viewers believe it was really happening. Although he did not set out to make a dinosaur film better than any others, he did want &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; to be &quot;the most realistic of them all.&quot;

It eventually became clear to Spielberg that &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; would require more time in development, in order to determine the effects needed to create the dinosaurs. He shifted focus to his 1991 film &quot;Hook&quot;, while continuing to monitor progress on &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, including script revisions. The art department went on an eight-month hiatus from &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; to work on &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;, another Universal film. After completing &quot;Hook&quot;, Spielberg wanted &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; to be his next film. Sid Sheinberg, president of Music Corporation of America (Universal&#x27;s parent company at the time) gave the greenlight to &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; on the condition that Spielberg make &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; first. Set designs began to be finalized in January 1992; a hotel was among locations at the fictional park that would be cut from the film.

Kathleen Kennedy, who co-founded Amblin Entertainment with Spielberg, would serve as a producer on &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; alongside Gerald Molen, who had worked with Amblin in the past. Kennedy handled the creative aspects of the project, while Molen managed production-related elements. Dean Cundey, the cinematographer for &quot;Hook&quot;, would rejoin Spielberg for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, signing on to the project relatively late in pre-production. However, he had followed the film&#x27;s progress through an association with Carter; both had worked on &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;. Cundey described his cinematography as &quot;a realistic, crisp, color-saturated look,&quot; aligning with Spielberg&#x27;s vision for the film. Michael Kahn, Spielberg&#x27;s longtime film editor, would also return for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

===Writing===
Crichton had mixed feelings about being offered a further $500,000 to write the film adaptation: &quot;I was &quot;so&quot; tired of the whole area that I didn&#x27;t really want to do the screenplay. I was sick of Malcolm and I was sick of Grant–and I was even sick of the dinosaurs. But I really felt that I knew the dimensions of the story.&quot; Crichton recognized that, by writing the screenplay himself, the project could avoid the same issues he experienced while developing the novel.

Before writing the film, he met several times with Spielberg to discuss which aspects of the book he liked and disliked. Crichton completed his first draft later in 1990, but said &quot;nobody was happy with it at all&quot;; the draft skipped ahead to action rather than building up to it, as in the novel. At Spielberg&#x27;s suggestion, Crichton rewrote the script in 40-page increments, with the first batch being better received. Crichton was aided by existing storyboards and sketches as he continued to rework the script, with the remaining 80 pages completed in early 1991.

====New writers====
Crichton had agreed only to write a preliminary version of the film: &quot;I told Steven, &#x27;I&#x27;ll do a draft for you and cut it down to budgetable size; but then you&#x27;re going to want somebody else to polish the characters.&#x27; I think that sort of surprised him, because writers never say, &#x27;Get somebody else.&#x27;&quot; Crichton finished his draft as Spielberg was filming &quot;Hook&quot;, the latter co-written by Malia Scotch Marmo and produced by Kennedy. While on the set of &quot;Hook&quot;, Scotch Marmo was reading the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; novel and learned from Kennedy about the film adaptation, accepting an offer to work on its screenplay. Scotch Marmo began writing &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; in October 1991. She chose to start from scratch, with the novel as her basis, although she did read Crichton&#x27;s screenplay and consulted with him. Spielberg also agreed to provide her with his own copy of the novel, which contained highlighted aspects of the book that he enjoyed. In addition, she looked at the numerous storyboards produced up to that point.

Scotch Marmo focused on building up the characters &quot;to give them more life and more purpose&quot; than in Crichton&#x27;s novel and screenplay. She removed Malcolm from the story and tried to incorporate his characteristics into Grant, whom she found to be underdeveloped. She also sought to emphasis the major themes of the novel, specifically the &quot;fatal flaw of trying to control nature,&quot; for instance by showing jungle vegetation creeping into the park&#x27;s unfinished visitor center: &quot;The idea was that nature was always in the way, always pushing hard against the intrusion.&quot; In the novel, Hammond is killed by a group of &quot;Procompsognathus&quot;. Crichton&#x27;s draft had also included a death scene, with Hammond killed by a &quot;Velociraptor&quot; at the visitor center. In Scotch Marmo&#x27;s draft, Hammond would choose to stay behind on Isla Nublar, and the other characters would escape after surviving a &quot;T. rex&quot; attack on their helicopter.

Scotch Marmo spent five months writing her draft and worked closely with Spielberg, noting that their collaboration was unlike most films in which writers &quot;get an assignment, go home, write it and turn it in.&quot; She would send him 15 pages at a time, and then would rework them to his liking, sending the revised pages back along with the next 15. She completed her draft in March 1992; Spielberg read it twice and was dissatisfied. She recalled later, &quot;As a writer, that&#x27;s a terrible feeling. The natural urge is to say: &#x27;Give me another week. I can work it out. I know I can.&#x27; But the truth is, sometimes you do hit and sometimes you miss. It&#x27;s just a shame that it takes so long to find out.&quot;
Spielberg immediately began searching for a new writer, and Universal president Casey Silver recommended David Koepp, who co-wrote &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;. Koepp had not read the novel, but quickly obtained a copy, and later discussed the book with Spielberg. Koepp disliked doing rewrites because &quot;it&#x27;s very hard to get into the mind of somebody else and try to follow what they were doing.&quot; Spielberg told Koepp he could start from scratch, allowing his own ideas to fully develop. He read through the novel four times before he began writing the screenplay, and chose not to read the earlier drafts until he finished his own. Two sequences from the novel were mandated: the &quot;T. rex&quot; attack on a tour vehicle, and the raptors in the kitchen. Otherwise, Koepp was generally allowed to make his own creative choices.

Koepp found it difficult to condense the novel&#x27;s scientific exposition, especially the dialogue that explains how the dinosaurs were created. Spielberg devised an idea to easily convey the cloning process through a short, animated film shown to the park visitors. Koepp named the film&#x27;s cartoon narrator &quot;Mr. DNA&quot;, after Spielberg jokingly referred to the character as such. Like Scotch Marmo, Koepp also sought to flesh out the characters of the novel while merging Malcolm&#x27;s traits into Grant, finding the former character too difficult to write: &quot;I told Steven before I started, &#x27;That guy&#x27;s gotta go. [...] He&#x27;s just talking for pages at a time about esoteric scientific concepts&#x27;.&quot;

After Koepp finished his first draft, Spielberg sent it to Scotch Marmo for her opinion, and she replied with 12 pages of input; these were forwarded to Koepp, who found them helpful. He continued to work closely with Spielberg and with additional feedback from Scotch Marmo. Malcolm was written in at Spielberg&#x27;s insistence, after Jeff Goldblum auditioned for the film and was deemed perfect for the role. Koepp tried to make the characters interesting, with moments such as Malcolm flirting with Sattler, leading to Grant&#x27;s jealousy. He also tried to avoid excessive character detail because &quot;whenever they started talking about their personal lives, you couldn&#x27;t care less.&quot; Spielberg suggested modifying a scene so that the &quot;T. rex&quot; pursues characters in a Jeep; originally, it only depicted them driving away after hearing the dinosaur&#x27;s footsteps.

Rewrites continued until just before the start of filming. Crichton noted that the final draft differed drastically from his earlier script, but praised the changes and said the new screenplay &quot;seems very compatible with my way of thinking—it fits in my mind.&quot; Scotch Marmo did not receive credit for her work.

====Novel changes====
Crichton said that because the novel was &quot;fairly long,&quot; at nearly 400 pages, the film adaptation would only have about 10-20% of its content; scenes were dropped for budgetary and practical reasons, and the violence was toned down. Spielberg said, &quot;What I wanted to do was boil the book down and choose my seven or eight favorite scenes and base the script around those.&quot; In a departure from the novel, Spielberg sought to reduce the number of dinosaurs, believing it would not be &quot;physically possible&quot; to make the film otherwise. Koepp said the novel was written &quot;more or less like a movie,&quot; making it one of the easier book-to-film adaptations he had worked on. He said that, like with any adaptation, the most difficult part of his writing assignment was to determine the overall structure of the story.

Spielberg removed an early scene in the novel, in which &quot;Procompsognathus&quot; kill a baby, as he found it too horrific. Another scene set in a pterosaur aviary was also removed, as it did not move the plot along. A major sequence, present in the novel and the two earlier screenplays, involved the &quot;T. rex&quot; chasing Grant and Hammond&#x27;s grandchildren in a raft down a river. Koepp chose not to include this in his script: &quot;I never wanted the raft sequence. It seemed to me that at certain points in the book we were being taken on sort of an obligatory tour past every dinosaur the park had to offer.&quot; He said the omission was an easy choice, calling the sequence redundant and noting that it would have been &quot;monstrously expensive&quot; to shoot. Novel scenes that were cut from the film adaptation would gradually be included in sequels, with the raft sequence being featured in the 2025 film &quot;Jurassic World Rebirth&quot;.

Several characters were modified for the film. Originally a ruthless and greedy businessman in the novel, Hammond was rewritten to be sympathetic, as Spielberg related to the character&#x27;s obsession with showmanship. The ages of Tim and Lex were switched; Spielberg did this because he wanted to work with the younger Joseph Mazzello, and it allowed him to introduce the subplot of Lex&#x27;s adolescent crush on Grant. For the film, Lex would also take on Tim&#x27;s interest in computers. In another change, Grant and Sattler are made a couple for the film, adding subtle romance. Koepp changed Grant&#x27;s relationship with the children, making him initially hostile to them to allow for more character development. This is partly reflected through his relationship with Sattler, who wants them to have children of their own. Removed from the film was Ed Regis, the park&#x27;s public relations chief, whose cowardly traits were merged into Donald Gennaro. Several other characters were reduced to one scene each, including Henry Wu, Dr. Harding, and Dodgson. The name of InGen&#x27;s corporate rival and Dodgson&#x27;s employer, Biosyn, is also omitted.

===Casting===
Because much of the film&#x27;s budget was going toward its dinosaur effects, Spielberg sought to cast relatively unknown actors, saying further: &quot;Basically, I wanted good, solid actors who weren&#x27;t going to charge outrageous prices. I didn&#x27;t want to spend three to five million dollars apiece on actors&quot;. Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss were considered for the role of Alan Grant, but were deemed too expensive. William Hurt, Harrison Ford, and Tim Robbins turned down the role, which eventually went to Sam Neill. Laura Dern was cast as Ellie Sattler, after Robin Wright and Juliette Binoche turned down offers to play the character. Stacy Haiduk, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Helen Hunt had also auditioned for the role.

Casting director Janet Hirshenson felt that Jeff Goldblum was right to play Ian Malcolm after reading the novel, although Jim Carrey also auditioned for the role. According to Hirshenson, Carrey &quot;was terrific, too, but I think pretty quickly we all loved the idea of Jeff&quot;. Richard Attenborough was cast as John Hammond, but was initially hesitant to join the project, which marked his first acting role in 14 years. He eventually signed on at the insistence of Spielberg, who told him, &quot;I can&#x27;t see anyone else playing it but you&quot;. Neill, Dern, Goldblum, and Attenborough were cast late in pre-production, with only a few weeks to prepare for their roles. According to Neill, the process &quot;all happened real quick. I hadn&#x27;t read the book, knew nothing about it, hadn&#x27;t heard anything about it, and in a matter of weeks I&#x27;m working with Spielberg&quot;. The start of filming was delayed a month to accommodate Neill&#x27;s schedule.

Ariana Richards, who plays Lex Murphy, said: &quot;I was called into a casting office, and they just wanted me to scream. I heard later on that Steven had watched a few girls on tape that day, and I was the only one who ended up waking his sleeping wife on the couch, and she came running through the hallway to see if the kids were all right&quot;. Christina Ricci also auditioned to play Lex. Joseph Mazzello had screen-tested for a role in &quot;Hook&quot;, but was deemed too young. Spielberg promised him they would work together on a future film, subsequently casting him for the role of Tim.

Hirshenson, who previously cast Whoopi Goldberg in the 1990 film &quot;Ghost&quot;, had Samuel L. Jackson audition as Ray Arnold after Goldberg noted his performance in the 1991 film &quot;Jungle Fever&quot;. Spielberg and Hirshenson were instantly impressed with Jackson and gave him the role. Spielberg chose Wayne Knight to play Dennis Nedry after seeing him in the 1992 film &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;. BD Wong was cast as Dr. Henry Wu, both of Asian descent. He was disappointed by how small the role turned out to be compared with the novel, believing the character&#x27;s reduced screentime to be the result of &quot;racial exclusion&quot;. Cameron Thor had worked with Spielberg on &quot;Hook&quot;, and initially auditioned to play Malcolm, before being cast as Dodgson. Molen took on the small role of Dr. Harding. In the novel, Richard Kiley provides the voice of the guide for the park&#x27;s tour vehicles. For the film, Kiley was cast in the same role.

===Design===

Production designer Rick Carter did not want the fictional theme park to have &quot;a lot of commercialized edifices that feel shallow and overly bright and overly energetic. Even though that is something that the park would probably evolve into if it were finished, I thought as a film it would feel shallow. This is, after all, not Disneyland.&quot; The exterior design of the park&#x27;s visitor center was loosely based on a Jerusalem temple. The interior design featured a dinosaur theme, including skeletons and a mural, the latter by artist Doug Henderson. For the control room, set designer Lauren Cory referred to computer environments at several theme parks as well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The set included a wall-mounted screen and numerous computers, lent by Apple, Silicon Graphics and Thinking Machines Corporation.

The park&#x27;s vehicles were designed by art director John Bell. Crichton&#x27;s book has electric-powered Toyota Land Cruisers as the tour vehicles, but Spielberg made a deal with the Ford Motor Company, which provided seven Ford Explorers. They received a custom paint job and a plexiglass roof. Like in the novel, the vehicles are presented as autonomous cars. They travel on a track that, in reality, was non-functional. Industrial Light &amp; Magic, along with veteran customizer George Barris, modified the Explorers to be controlled by drivers hidden in the trunk of the vehicles, with front-mounted cameras allowing them to see the road. Barris also customized Jeep Wranglers used by the park&#x27;s workers.

In the film, Dodgson gives Nedry a container, disguised as a can of shaving cream, which is used to transport the stolen dinosaur embryos. According to Bell, the script did not specify a brand of shaving cream, so he browsed at a drug store and eventually chose Barbasol for its distinctive design. In addition, Bell designed night vision goggles used by Tim, prior to the &quot;T. rex&quot; breakout.

The decision was made to forego a costume designer. Instead, Molen brought on the costume supervisors from &quot;Hook&quot;, who selected ready-to-wear clothing for the cast from various retailers. Malcolm&#x27;s all-black outfit was an aspect lifted from the novel, and Goldblum added to it by wearing a black leather jacket. Hammond&#x27;s all-white outfit was meant to evoke him as a sort of religious figure or deity.

===Filming===
====Hawaii====

The film&#x27;s fictional setting of Isla Nublar is located near Costa Rica, which was briefly considered as a filming location early on; this idea was scrapped as production would have occurred during the country&#x27;s rainy season. Puerto Rico was seriously considered as well, until Spielberg settled on Kauai, Hawaii. He attributed this decision to his age: &quot;Had I been twenty-six instead of forty-five, I might have gone to Yucatan or the Philippines or Costa Rica–someplace really rugged.&quot; He also liked the idea of &quot;staying in a nice Hawaiian hotel with room service and a pool&quot;, while stating that the tropical landscapes were as good, or better than, the alternative sites. In addition, Spielberg was familiar with Hawaii, having filmed there in the past, and was concerned about infrastructure and accessibility at the other locations. Set construction began in early June 1992, nearly three months before the start of filming. Some of the locations were remote and only accessible with off-road vehicles.
After 25 months of pre-production, filming began on August 24, 1992, at Olokele Canyon. The three-week Kauai shoot was focused on exterior scenes, many of them set on Isla Nublar during daytime. Spontaneous cloud coverage occurred frequently, necessitating the use of lighting and film exposure tricks in order to match with previously shot footage. Scenes of the park&#x27;s visitors arriving and departing Isla Nublar, via helicopter, were filmed at Manawaiopuna Falls, which became commonly known as Jurassic Falls after the film&#x27;s release. Keopuka Rock, alternatively known as Jurassic Rock, was used for an early shot of the helicopter as it approaches Isla Nublar. The rock is located near the island of Maui, but filming otherwise continued on Kauai.

The exterior of the Jurassic Park visitor center was built on the grounds of the Valley House Plantation Estate. It was constructed as a -high facade, nearly in length. A Jurassic Park gate, marking the start of the theme park tour, was built at the base of Mount Waialeale.
An early scene, set at an amber mine in the Dominican Republic, was filmed near Hoʻopiʻi Falls. A meeting between Nedry and Dodgson was shot in Kapaa, standing in for San José, Costa Rica. The raptor enclosure set was built at Limahuli Garden and Preserve, operated by the National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG). Allerton Garden, another NTBG property, was used in two instances: a set depicting the maintenance shed exterior, and a scene in which Grant discovers a dinosaur nest and realizes the animals are breeding.

Towering fences, standing , were among the on-site construction work, representing the electrified perimeters of the &quot;T. rex&quot; enclosure during daytime scenes. Despite the simple design of the fencing, the project proved to be one of the most difficult for the production crew, as one of the filming sites was the remote Olokele Canyon. Special effects supervisor Michael Lantieri said &quot;we had to haul all of this steel up there, drill holes like you would for telephone poles, pour concrete, and then pull all of the cables, which were three-quarter-inch aluminum with steel in the middle.&quot;
The longest stretch of fence measured over , and more than six miles of cable were used in total. Spielberg wanted to avoid sagging in the cables, so the crew hired workers from a local company that was experienced with power lines. Lantieri called the project &quot;an enormous job—and for very little payoff. People will look at the movie and say, &#x27;Oh, there&#x27;s a fence,&#x27; never realizing what it took to get it there.&quot; The canyon location was used for a scene in which Grant and the children, on their way to the visitor center, must climb over the fence to proceed.

On September 11, 1992, the last scheduled day of the Kauai shoot, Hurricane Iniki passed directly over the island. The cast and crew found out too late about the impending hurricane and took shelter at their hotel. Spielberg and a small crew ventured outside during the hurricane to capture brief footage, used in the film to depict the storm that hits Isla Nublar. A final scene, depicting a &quot;Gallimimus&quot; herd, was to be shot on Kauai, but the island was ravaged by the hurricane. The scene was instead filmed two weeks later at Kualoa Ranch, located on the island of Oahu. With its high cliffs, the ranch was considered more attractive than the empty plain that was originally planned for the scene. Despite the hurricane, the Hawaiian shoot came in essentially on budget and on schedule.

====California====

By September 15, 1992, the cast and crew had moved to California, where the remainder of filming was scheduled to take place, primarily on sound stages. The majority of stage shooting occurred at the Universal Studios Lot in the Los Angeles area. Among the first sets to be used there was an industrial-sized kitchen, for when the raptors stalk Lex and Tim. Because the kitchen was filled with reflective surfaces, Cundey had to carefully plan the illumination while also using black cloths to hide the light reflections. The scene was shot on Stage 24, and other stages at Universal would also be used for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

Filming moved to Stage 23 for scenes involving the maintenance shed interior, before moving to Red Rock Canyon, which stood in as Grant&#x27;s paleontological dig site. The filmmakers originally planned to shoot in Montana, where the scene is set, but this was scrapped to save time and money. Jack Horner, the film&#x27;s paleontological advisor, was consulted to ensure an accurate representation of a dig site, although other paleontologists have found the scene to be overly simplified and unrealistic.

Filming continued to progress ahead of schedule, with Spielberg crediting the project&#x27;s extensive use of storyboards. Back at Universal, Stage 27 was decorated with real and synthetic jungle vegetation for various scenes. The stage was used initially to depict Grant helping Tim out of a tour vehicle, after it has been shoved over a cliff by the &quot;T. rex&quot; and into a tree. Upon retrieving Tim, the vehicle begins to drop through the tree foliage, forcing the humans to quickly descend before being crushed. This was one of the most challenging scenes to shoot and required the creation of a artificial tree, made of steel, with the vehicle dropped down the tree multiple times to acquire the needed footage. Spielberg wanted the tree to appear three times taller than it actually was, so three sides were each decorated to represent a different portion of the vehicle drop. The same steel structure was then redressed to serve as a different tree, for a scene in which Grant and the children take refuge and encounter a &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;. Stage 28 was used for scenes taking place in the park&#x27;s control room and laboratory. Wong shot his scene on the latter set, over the course of a day or two.
Universal lacked a stage large enough to accommodate the &quot;T. rex&quot; breakout set, which was instead filmed on Stage 16 at Warner Bros. Studios, located nearby. Filming began there on October 27, 1992, with the stage decorated to match the Hawaii footage. The sequence is set at night during a storm, and the stage included rain machines and mud, making the shoot wet and messy for the cast and crew. Spielberg anticipated that the sequence could be the most difficult of the film, due to the rain machines and the logistics of using a life-sized &quot;T. rex&quot; animatronic. Complications arose when the &quot;T. rex&quot; began to shake and quiver from extra weight, as the dinosaur&#x27;s foam rubber skin had absorbed a significant amount of the rainwater. Crew members had to dry the model with shammys between takes. The animatronic also lost a tooth during a scene in which it attacks the glass roof on one of the tour vehicles. 

An early shot in the sequence focuses on the dashboard of one of the vehicles, with ripples forming in a glass of water, caused by the footsteps of the approaching &quot;T. rex&quot;. This was inspired by Spielberg listening to Earth, Wind and Fire in his car, and the vibrations the bass rhythm caused. Lantieri was unsure how to create the shot until the night before filming when he put a glass of water on his guitar, which achieved the concentric circles in the water that Spielberg wanted. The next morning, guitar strings were put inside the car, and a man on the floor plucked them to achieve the effect. Like Gennaro, Malcolm was originally scripted to flee in fear from the &quot;T. rex&quot;. This was changed with an on-set suggestion by Goldblum, who felt that heroic action was better. Instead, the scene features Malcolm using a flare to distract the dinosaur, allowing Grant to retrieve the children from the wrecked tour vehicle. 

The Warner Bros. set included the cliff that the &quot;T. rex&quot; shoves the vehicle over. Koepp questioned the set design, which created an apparent plot hole, as the cliff would appear seemingly where the dinosaur had broken out: &quot;I asked Steven, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you think people are going to notice that suddenly there&#x27;s this cliff?&#x27; And he looked at me like I was from another planet and pointed at the great big robot of the T. rex and said, &#x27;There&#x27;s a T. rex! They&#x27;re not gonna notice anything else but that!&#x27; And he was right.&quot; Also filmed at Warner Bros. was the &quot;T. rex&quot;″s pursuit of a Jeep. Returning to Universal, the filmmakers shot scenes involving the deaths of Nedry and Muldoon, both on Stage 27; this location and Stage 16 were the only sound stages used for exterior scenes.

The &quot;T. rex&quot; sequence at Warner Bros., shot weeks before the end of filming, made Spielberg realize the dinosaur as the main star of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. He felt that audiences would be disappointed if the &quot;T. rex&quot; did not make a final appearance, and had the ending changed so the dinosaur faces off against multiple raptors in the visitor center, inadvertently saving the humans. Afterward, the &quot;T. rex&quot; makes what Spielberg described as a &quot;King Kong roar&quot; while a banner reading &quot;When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth&quot; falls. As previously written, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; would end with a single raptor pursuing the humans and Grant using a platform machine to maneuver the dinosaur into a fossil tyrannosaur&#x27;s jaws. The visitor center interior was constructed on Stage 12 at Universal. Cundey shot the finale with wide lenses to show off as much of the set as possible, but this also made the placing of on-set lights a &quot;painstaking&quot; process. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; wrapped under budget and 12 days ahead of schedule on November 30, 1992.

===Dinosaurs on screen===

For &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, Spielberg sought to go beyond a simple monster movie, with Carter stating that they &quot;tried to find the animal in the dinosaur as opposed to the monster in the dinosaur. The idea was not to make them any less threatening, but rather to keep them from doing as much &#x27;monster schtick.&#x27;&quot; Spielberg hired paleontologist Jack Horner to ensure that the dinosaurs would be designed and portrayed accurately, based on then-current knowledge of the animals. Certain concepts about dinosaurs were followed, like the theory they evolved into birds and had very little in common with lizards. This prompted the removal of the raptors&#x27; flicking tongues in early animatics, as Horner complained it was implausible.

Despite the film title&#x27;s referencing the Jurassic period, &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; and &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; are the only dinosaurs featured that lived during that time; the other species in the film did not exist until the Cretaceous. The latter period is mentioned early in the film when Grant describes the ferocity of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; to a young boy, saying: &quot;Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period&quot;.

====Effects====

The dinosaurs were created through various methods, including animatronics and computer-generated imagery (CGI). Spielberg sought to use full-scale dinosaurs on-set as much as possible, rather than relying on stop motion, a post-production method commonly used in dinosaur films up to that point. He knew, early on, that stop motion would still be needed for wide shots of the dinosaurs. To help create the dinosaurs, Spielberg consulted and worked closely with Dennis Muren, an effects supervisor at Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), which had already provided effects for several of his films. Spielberg hired Phil Tippett to create the dinosaur wide shots using go-motion, a variation of stop-motion, with ILM set to refine his work through compositing.

Separately, Spielberg thought of hiring ride designer Bob Gurr to create the full-scale dinosaurs, having been impressed by his work on a giant mechanical King Kong, made for the King Kong Encounter at Universal Studios Hollywood. Upon reflection, Spielberg felt that Gurr&#x27;s life-sized robots would be too expensive and unconvincing. Spielberg then contacted effects artist Stan Winston, having seen his work on the queen alien in the 1986 film &quot;Aliens&quot;. Winston said the queen was easy compared to a dinosaur animatronic, because it was lightweight and did not have to look like a real animal. Nevertheless, he was intrigued by the offer to work on &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

Winston had one of his company artists, Mark &quot;Crash&quot; McCreery, create numerous dinosaur sketches. These impressed Universal, which eventually hired Winston&#x27;s team to make the film&#x27;s on-set dinosaurs. Winston and ILM also worked together on the film &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, released in 1991. As with previous films, Winston&#x27;s workers consisted of two groups: the art department, responsible in this case for the dinosaurs&#x27; outer appearance; and the mechanical department, which would handle the technical inner workings. Winston&#x27;s crew created fully detailed models of the dinosaurs before molding latex skins, which were fitted over complex robotics. Sound stages were considered the most ideal filming environment for the animatronics, allowing sets to be built on elevated platforms with the mechanics of the dinosaurs concealed underneath.
In addition to wide shots, Tippett was tasked with creating go-motion animatics early on to help develop two major sequences: one depicting the &quot;T. rex&quot; breakout, and the other involving the raptors in the kitchen. His team built the dinosaur puppets and based their design on maquettes made by Winston. Despite go motion&#x27;s attempts at motion blurs, Spielberg found the end results unsatisfactory for a live-action feature film. He wanted to include a stampede of dinosaur herds, but was unsure how to achieve this. After breaking new ground with the CGI effects in &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, Muren thought ILM could handle the stampede rather than Tippett: &quot;Creating herds of animals with puppets would be very difficult, so I thought maybe that was something we might be able to do with computer graphics.&quot;

ILM animator Steve Williams believed that more could be done with CGI than just the stampede: &quot;All of us wanted a crack at the T-rex, but we thought we could never get it because Stan was already in there, and so was Phil. But the attraction was strong, so I secretly started building some T-rex bones in the computer.&quot; Williams scanned various photographs to create his virtual skeleton and then animated a walk cycle for it. Fellow animator Mark Dippé also believed that CGI could be used for the film on a large scale, pushing Muren for months to consider the possibility. Muren, Kennedy and Molen were impressed when Williams unveiled his skeleton animation, and Muren was given approval to explore the use of CGI for the herd shots.

The &quot;T. rex&quot; animation was examined further. Winston&#x27;s fifth-scale prototype of the dinosaur was scanned by Cyberware, and the data was refined with various computer programs to fit over the skeleton, creating a digital &quot;T. rex&quot;. Other programs were used to animate the creature, with the finished result impressing Spielberg so much that he scrapped the go-motion method, instead tasking ILM with creating digital dinosaurs for full-body shots. Upon seeing the &quot;T. rex&quot; animation, Tippett had declared, &quot;I think I&#x27;m extinct.&quot; Spielberg had this incorporated into the script: Grant, impressed by Jurassic Park&#x27;s living dinosaurs, says to Sattler, &quot;We&#x27;re out of a job,&quot; to which Malcolm replies, &quot;Don&#x27;t you mean extinct?&quot;
Tippett had assembled a 30-person crew to prepare for the go-motion segments; Spielberg did not wish to lose his expertise, and Muren sought to keep him involved with the project as an advisor to ILM&#x27;s animators. Muren later noted that &quot;this is the first generation of computer animators, and they are struggling with hardware and software limitations that make the process excruciatingly painful and slow.&quot; Although Tippett disliked computers, Muren eventually convinced him to remain involved on &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Tippett and the ILM team spent approximately a month learning each other&#x27;s respective fields.

Tippett acted as a consultant for dinosaur anatomy, and his animatics were used, along with storyboards, as a reference for what would be shot during the action sequences. ILM&#x27;s artists were sent on private tours to a local animal park, so they could study large animals – rhinos, elephants, alligators, and giraffes – up close. They also took mime classes to aid in understanding movements. Special effects work continued during post-production, as Tippett&#x27;s unit adjusted to new technology with Dinosaur Input Devices: models that fed information into computers, allowing them to animate the dinosaurs like stop-motion puppets. In addition, they acted out scenes with the raptors and &quot;Gallimimus&quot;.

The CGI dinosaurs by ILM, based on Winston&#x27;s designs, took nearly a year to complete. Compositing the animals onto the live action scenes took around an hour. Rendering the dinosaurs often took two to four hours per frame, while the &quot;T. rex&quot; in the rain required six hours per frame. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; has more than 50 CGI shots, with the end fight between the &quot;T. rex&quot; and raptors using all-CGI dinosaurs, something that made Spielberg nervous until he saw the finished result. The 127-minute film has 15 minutes of total screen time for the dinosaurs, including nine minutes of animatronics and six minutes of CGI.

====List====
Various dinosaurs are featured throughout the film:
* &quot;Alamosaurus&quot; appears as a skeleton in the Jurassic Park visitor center.
* &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; is the first dinosaur the park&#x27;s visitors see. It is inaccurately depicted as chewing its food and standing up on its hind legs to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, resembling a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur&#x27;s head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded to be used in the noises of the dinosaurs.
* &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; is also very different from its real-life counterpart, made significantly smaller to ensure audiences did not confuse it with the raptors. Its neck frill and its ability to spit venom are fictitious. Its vocal sounds were made by combining a swan, a hawk, a howler monkey, and a rattlesnake. The animatronic model, nicknamed &quot;Spitter&quot; by Winston&#x27;s team, was animated by the puppeteers sitting on a trench in the set floor, using a paintball mechanism to spit the mixture of methyl cellulose and K-Y Jelly that served as venom.
* &quot;Gallimimus&quot; are featured in a stampede scene in which the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; eats one of them. The &quot;Gallimimus&quot; was the first dinosaur to be digitized, featured in two ILM tests, initially as a herd of skeletons and then fully skinned while pursued by the &quot;T. rex&quot;. Its design was based on ostriches, and to emphasize the birdlike qualities, the animation focused mostly on the herd rather than individual animals. As reference for the dinosaurs&#x27; run, the animators were filmed running at the ILM parking lot, with plastic pipes standing in as a fallen tree that the &quot;Gallimimus&quot; jump over. The footage inspired the incorporation of an animal falling, as one of the artists did trying to make the jump. Horse squeals became the &quot;Gallimimus&quot;″s sounds.
* &quot;Parasaurolophus&quot; appear in the background during the first encounter with the &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;.
* &quot;Triceratops&quot; has an extended cameo, depicted as sick from eating a toxic plant. Its appearance was a logistical nightmare for Winston when Spielberg asked to shoot the animatronic of the sick creature earlier than expected. The model, operated by eight puppeteers on Kauai, was the first dinosaur filmed during production, and was the only one brought to Hawaii for filming. Winston also created a baby &quot;Triceratops&quot; for Richards to ride, a scene cut from the script for pacing reasons. Rydstrom combined the sound of himself breathing into a cardboard tube with the cows near his workplace at Skywalker Ranch to create the &quot;Triceratops&quot; vocals.
* The &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; (an individual later referred to by fans as &quot;Rexy&quot;) was partly represented by a life-sized animatronic, which stood , weighed , and was long. It was the largest creature made by Winston&#x27;s studio up to that point. Horner called it &quot;the closest I&#x27;ve ever been to a live dinosaur&quot;. While the consulting paleontologists did not agree on the dinosaur&#x27;s movement, particularly its running capabilities, animator Steve Williams decided to &quot;throw physics out the window and create a &quot;T. rex&quot; that moved at sixty miles per hour even though its hollow bones would have busted if it ran that fast&quot;. The major reason was the &quot;T. rex&quot; chasing a Jeep, a scene that took two months to finish. The dinosaur is depicted with a vision system based on movement, though later studies indicate the &quot;T. rex&quot; had binocular vision comparable to a bird of prey. Its roar is a baby elephant&#x27;s squeal combined with alligator and crocodile noises as well as a tiger&#x27;s snarl and a lion&#x27;s roar, its grunts those of a male koala, and its breath a whale&#x27;s blow. A dog attacking a rope toy was used for the sounds of the &quot;T. rex&quot; tearing a &quot;Gallimimus&quot; apart, while cut sequoias crashing to the ground became the sound of its footsteps. 
* &quot;Velociraptor&quot; plays a major role in the film. The creature&#x27;s depiction is not based on the actual dinosaur genus, which was significantly smaller. Crichton instead based his version on &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, which his research had indicated to be a &quot;Velociraptor&quot; relative. He kept the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; name as he thought it sounded more dramatic. Shortly before &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;″s release, the similar &quot;Utahraptor&quot; was discovered, although it proved even bigger than the film&#x27;s raptors. This prompted Winston to joke, &quot;After we created it, they discovered it&quot;. For the attack on Muldoon and parts of the kitchen sequence, the raptors were played by men in suits. Other methods would also be used to portray the dinosaurs, including on-set puppets. During a take on the kitchen set, one of the raptors slammed into Mazzello, who sustained a minor head injury from its hand claw. Dolphin screams, walruses bellowing, geese hissing, an African crane&#x27;s mating call, tortoises mating, and human rasps were mixed to formulate various raptor sounds. Following discoveries made after the film&#x27;s release, most paleontologists theorize that dromaeosaurs like &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and &quot;Deinonychus&quot; were covered with feathers like modern birds. This feature is included in &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; for the male raptors, which have a row of small quills on their heads.

===Post-production===
Editing had already started during filming, and within days of wrapping, Kahn had a rough cut ready, allowing Spielberg to start filming &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. During this time, Spielberg left Kennedy in charge of the day-to-day post-production responsibilities on &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. He monitored the progress while filming in Poland, and had teleconferences four times a week with ILM&#x27;s crew. Spielberg estimated that 40 percent of the post-production process was done through this long-distance arrangement. He said working simultaneously on two vastly different productions was &quot;a bipolar experience&quot;, where he used &quot;every ounce of intuition on &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and every ounce of craft on &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;&quot;.

Along with the digital effects, Spielberg wanted the film to be the first with digital sound. He funded the creation of DTS (Digital Theater Systems) to allow audiences to &quot;really hear the movie the way it was intended to be heard&quot;. The sound effects crew was supervised by Spielberg&#x27;s friend and ILM founder George Lucas. Spielberg flew on weekends from Poland to Paris, where he met with sound designer Gary Rydstrom for updates. Rydstrom considered the sound process fun, given the film had all kinds of noise—animal sounds, rain, gunshots, car crashes—and at times no music. The process was finished by the end of April 1993.

As well as the CGI dinosaurs, ILM also created elements such as water splashing and digital face replacement for Ariana Richards&#x27;s stunt double. Software used to create the dinosaurs and other visual effects included Pixar&#x27;s RenderMan and Softimage 3D. ILM also used the program Viewpaint, which allowed the visual effects artists to paint color and texture directly onto the surface of the computer models. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was completed on May 28, 1993, after ILM concluded its CGI work.

==Music==

John Williams, a frequent composer of Spielberg&#x27;s films, began scoring &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; at the end of February 1993, and it was recorded a month later. Alexander Courage and John Neufeld provided the score&#x27;s orchestrations. As with the Spielberg film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, Williams felt he needed to write &quot;pieces that would convey a sense of &#x27;awe&#x27; and fascination&quot;, given that the film dealt with the &quot;overwhelming happiness and excitement&quot; of seeing live dinosaurs. More suspenseful scenes such as the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; attack required frightening themes. The first soundtrack album was released on May 25, 1993. For the 20th anniversary of the film&#x27;s release, a new soundtrack was issued for digital download on April 9, 2013, including four bonus tracks selected by Williams.

==Marketing==

Universal took the lengthy pre-production period to carefully plan the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; marketing campaign. It cost $65 million and included deals with 100 companies to market 1,000 products. These included: several &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; video games by Sega and Ocean Software; a toy line by Kenner distributed by Hasbro; McDonald&#x27;s &quot;Dino-Sized meals&quot;; and a novelization for young children.

Much care was put into creating a logo that would serve to equally represent the fictional park and promote the movie and its tie-in products. Universal creative director Tom Martin joined forces with the design firm of Mike Salisbury, and out of 100 designs came one created by Sandy Collora, one of Winston&#x27;s employees. The design took the &quot;T. rex&quot; skeleton drawn by Chip Kidd for the book&#x27;s cover, put it into a circle, and added a rectangle with the title to create a badge-like structure. A jungle silhouette was added underneath for scale, and a Neuland typeface was used on the title. John Alvin was hired to design the film&#x27;s poster; he went through many revisions, with the final design simply using the film&#x27;s &quot;T. rex&quot; logo.

Neill recalled that the film was essentially marketed by Universal with the idea that the studio &quot;could make huge blockbusters without &#x27;movie stars&quot;, stating, &quot;This was true enough, but I think it slightly irked us, the actors, to be reminded from time to time we were not real &#x27;stars.&#x27;&quot; Universal would instead tease the film&#x27;s dinosaurs as the primary attraction. A teaser trailer was released in December 1992, in which a mine worker discovers a piece of amber that would be used by the theme park. A full trailer debuted shortly thereafter, providing only a fleeting glimpse of the dinosaurs, a tactic described by journalist Josh Horowitz, in 2007, as &quot;that old Spielberg axiom of never revealing too much&quot;. The film was marketed with the tagline &quot;An Adventure 65 Million Years in the Making&quot;. This was a joke Spielberg made on set about the genuine, thousands of years old mosquito in amber used for Hammond&#x27;s walking stick. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was heavily marketed against its primary competitor, &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, which ultimately struggled at the box office and with critics.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; premiered at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C. on June 9, 1993, in support of two children&#x27;s charities. The film had previews on 1,412 screens starting at 9:30 pm EDT on Thursday, June 10, and officially opened on Friday in 2,404 theater locations and an estimated 3,400 screens. Following the film&#x27;s release, a traveling exhibition called &quot;The Dinosaurs of Jurassic Park&quot; began, showcasing dinosaur skeletons and film props. The film began its international release on June 25, in Brazil before further openings in South America and then rolling out around most of the rest of the world from July 16 until October. The United Kingdom premiere helped save the Lyric Theatre in Carmarthen, Wales from closure, an event chronicled in the 2022 film &quot;Save the Cinema&quot;.

====Re-releases====
In anticipation of the film&#x27;s Blu-ray release, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; had a digital print released in UK cinemas on September 23, 2011.
Two years later, for the 20th anniversary of &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; a 3D version of the film was released in cinemas. Spielberg declared that he had produced the film with a sort of &quot;subconscious 3D&quot;, as scenes feature animals walking toward the cameras and some effects of foreground and background overlay. In 2011, he stated that &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was the only one of his works he had considered for a conversion. Once he saw the 3D version of &quot;Titanic&quot; in 2012, he liked the new look of the film so much that he hired the same retrofitting company, Stereo D. Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński closely supervised the nine-month process in-between the production of &quot;Lincoln&quot;. Stereo D executive Aaron Parry said the conversion was an evolution of what the company had done with &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;being able to capitalize on everything we learned with Jim [James Cameron] on &quot;Titanic&quot; and take it into a different genre and movie, and one with so many technical achievements&quot;. The studio had the help of ILM, which contributed some elements and updated effects shots for a better visual enhancement. It opened in the United States and seven other territories on April 5, 2013, with other countries receiving the re-release over the following six months. In 2018, the film was re-released in select theaters to celebrate its 25th anniversary. On August 25, 2023, the 3D version of the film was re-released in theaters to celebrate its 30th anniversary.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was first officially released on VHS by CIC Video on October 3, 1994, in the United Kingdom and Ireland, where it had an exclusive seven-week rental window before going on sale on November 21. In the rest of the world, it was officially released on VHS and LaserDisc on October 4, 1994 (by MCA/Universal Home Video in the United States). Despite the official release date, most US retailers decided not to wait that long and were selling it by 1 October. With 17 million units sold, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is the fifth-best-selling VHS tape ever. Three years later, a THX certified Widescreen VHS was released on September 9, 1997.

The film was also first released as a Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD and VHS on October 10, 2000, in both Widescreen (1.85:1) and Full Screen (1.33:1) versions, and as part of a box set with the sequel &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; and both movies&#x27; soundtrack albums. It was the 13th-best-selling DVD of 2000 counting both versions, finishing the year with 910,000 units sold. Following the release of &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;, a new box set with all the films called &quot;Jurassic Park Trilogy&quot; was released on December 11, 2001. It was repackaged as &quot;Jurassic Park Adventure Pack&quot; on November 29, 2005.

The trilogy was released on Blu-ray on October 25, 2011, debuting at number five on the Blu-ray charts, and nominated as the best release of the year by both the Las Vegas Film Critics Society and the Saturn Awards. In 2012, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was among twenty-five films chosen by Universal for a box set celebrating the studio&#x27;s 100th anniversary, while also receiving a standalone 100th anniversary Blu-ray featuring an augmented reality cover. The following year, the 20th anniversary 3D conversion was issued on Blu-ray 3D.

The film, alongside &quot;The Lost World&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; and &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, was released as part of a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray box set on May 22, 2018, in honor of the original film&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

====Television premiere====
&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was broadcast on television for the first time on NBC on May 7, 1995, following the April 26 airing of &quot;The Making of Jurassic Park&quot;. Some 68.12 million people tuned in, garnering NBC a 36 percent share of all available viewers that night. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was the highest-rated theatrical film broadcast on television by any network since the April 1987 airing of &quot;Trading Places&quot;. In June–July 1995, the film aired a number of times on the Turner Network Television (TNT) network.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; became the highest-grossing film released worldwide up to that time, replacing Spielberg&#x27;s own &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982). It grossed $3.1 million from Thursday night screenings in the United States and Canada on June 10, and $50.1 million in its first weekend from 2,404 theaters, breaking the opening weekend record set by &quot;Batman Returns&quot; the year before. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; held that record until 1995 when &quot;Batman Forever&quot; took it. It grossed a record $81.7 million by the end of its first week, and reached $100 million in a record nine days, and remained at number one for three weeks. It eventually grossed $357 million in the US and Canada, ranking second of all-time behind &quot;E.T.&quot; Box Office Mojo estimates the film sold over 86.2 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.

&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; also did very well in international markets and was the first film to gross $500 million overseas, surpassing the record $280 million overseas gross of &quot;E.T.&quot; In Brazil, it also set an opening weekend record with a gross of $1,738,198 from 141 screens. It went on to break further opening records around the world including in the United Kingdom, Japan, India, South Korea, Mexico, Germany, Australia, Taiwan, Italy, Denmark, South Africa and France. In Japan, the film grossed $8.4 million from 237 screens in two days (including previews).

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; also beat the opening weekend record set by &quot;Batman Returns&quot; with a gross of £4.875 million ($7.4 million) from 434 screens, including a record £443,000 from Thursday night previews, and also beat &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;″s opening week record, with £9.2 million. The film held the UK record until it was beaten by &quot;Independence Day&quot; in 1996. After 12 days of grossing over £1 million a day, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was the eighth highest-grossing film of all time in the UK. After just three weeks, it became the highest-grossing, surpassing &quot;Ghost&quot; and eventually doubling the record with a gross of £47.9 million. It spent a record eight consecutive weekends at the top of the UK box office. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; would remain as Europe&#x27;s box office leader before being surpassed by &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

In Australia, the film had the widest release ever and was the first to open with a one-day gross of more than A$1 million, grossing A$5,447,000 (US$3.6 million) in its first four days from 192 screens, beating the opening record of &quot;Terminator 2&quot; and the weekly record set by &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; with a gross of A$6.8 million. In the same weekend, it also set an opening record in Germany with a gross of DM 16.8 million ($10.5 million) from 644 screens. In Italy, it had the widest release ever in 344 theaters and grossed a record Lire9.5 billion ($6.1 million). After 115 days of release, it surpassed &quot;E.T.&quot; as the highest-grossing film worldwide of all time. It eventually opened in France on October 20, 1993, and grossed a record 75 million F ($13 million) in its opening week from over 515 screens. Its first week admissions in France of almost 2.3 million surpassed the previous record set by &quot;&quot; in 1985.

The film set all-time records in, among others, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Japan (in US Dollars), Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom. Ultimately the film grossed $914 million worldwide in its initial release, with Spielberg reportedly earning over $250 million, the most a director or actor had earned from one film at the time. Its record gross was surpassed in 1998 by &quot;Titanic&quot;, the first film to gross over $1billion.

The 2011 UK release grossed £245,422 ($786,021) from 276 theaters, finishing at eleventh on the weekend box office list. The 3D re-release in 2013 opened at fourth place in the US, with $18.6 million from 2,771 locations. IMAX showings accounted for over $6 million, with the 32 percent being the highest IMAX share ever for a nationwide release. The reissue earned $45.4 million in the United States and Canada. The international release had its most successful weekend in late August, when it managed to climb to the top of the box office with a $28.8 million debut in China. This helped to bring the film&#x27;s lifetime gross to $1.03 billion. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was the 17th, and oldest, film to surpass the $1billion mark, and the only film by Universal to achieve this until 2015, when the studio released &quot;Furious 7&quot;, &quot;Minions&quot;, and the fourth &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; installment &quot;Jurassic World&quot;.

&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; earned an additional $374,238 in 2018 for its 25th anniversary re-release. In June 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing most theaters worldwide and limiting what films played, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; returned to 230 theaters (mostly drive-ins). It grossed $517,600, finishing in first for the fourth time in its history. As of 2025, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; remains among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, both in the US and Canada (not adjusted for inflation) and worldwide. It also remains the highest-grossing film directed by Spielberg.

===Critical response===
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively reported an approval rating of 92% based on 142 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is a spectacle of special effects and lifelike animatronics, with some of Spielberg&#x27;s best sequences of sustained awe and sheer terror since &quot;Jaws&quot;&quot;. Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen [...] On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg&#x27;s talents [but] [i]t becomes less crisp on screen than it was on the page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away&quot;. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers called the film &quot;colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four: &quot;The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values&quot;. Henry Sheehan of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; argued: &quot;The complaints over &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;″s lack of story and character sound a little off the point&quot;, noting the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond&#x27;s grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them. Caroline Westbrook of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film five stars, calling it &quot;quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time&quot;.

===Accolades===

==Legacy==
Over the years, film critics and industry professionals have often cited &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; as one of the greatest and most influential movies in history. In 2001, the American Film Institute named &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; the 35th-most thrilling film of all time. Two years later, &quot;Empire&quot; called the first encounter with a &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; the 28th-most magical moment in cinema. In 2004, &quot;Empire&quot; judged &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; to be the sixth-most influential film in the magazine&#x27;s 15-year lifetime. &quot;Film Review&quot;, in 2005, declared the film to be one of the five most important in the magazine&#x27;s 55-year history.

&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is included in the book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;, and in a 2007 list by &quot;The Guardian&quot; of &quot;1000 films to see before you die&quot;. In 2008, an &quot;Empire&quot; poll of readers, filmmakers, and critics also rated it one of the 500 greatest films of all time. In a 2010 poll, the readers of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated it the greatest summer movie of the previous 20 years. In 2014, it was ranked as one of the 50 greatest films of all time in an extensive poll undertaken by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, which balloted every studio, agency, publicity firm and production house in the Hollywood region. In 2018, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, which deemed it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 2019, Mattel produced a line of new toys, including figures based on the film&#x27;s characters. The film&#x27;s 30th anniversary was marked with the release of various merchandise, including new toys from Mattel and Lego, as well as an event at San Diego Comic-Con.

===Impact===
&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; had a wide-ranging impact, particularly as an influence on other films due to its breakthrough use of computer-generated imagery. The film is regarded as a landmark for visual effects. Film historian Tom Shone said of the film&#x27;s innovation and influence, &quot;in its way, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; heralded a revolution in movies as profound as the coming of sound in 1927&quot;. Numerous filmmakers saw the effects as a realization that many of their visions, previously thought unfeasible or too expensive, were now possible. ILM owner George Lucas, realizing the success of creating realistic live dinosaurs by his own company, began work on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy; Stanley Kubrick decided to invest in pet project &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;, which he later got Spielberg to direct; and Peter Jackson began to re-explore his childhood love of fantasy films, a path that led him to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;King Kong&quot;. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; also inspired films and documentaries with dinosaurs such as the American adaptation of &quot;Godzilla&quot;, &quot;Carnosaur&quot; (in which Dern&#x27;s mother Diane Ladd starred), and &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;. Winston, enthusiastic about the new technology pioneered by the film, joined with IBM and director James Cameron to form a new special effects company, Digital Domain.

&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was also praised for its modern portrayal of dinosaurs. The film has been said to have given rise to a &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; generation: young people who were inspired to become paleontologists. Among the general public, the film also created an interest in dinosaurs, leading to increased funding for paleontology. This, combined with the rising number of paleontologists, resulted in a surge of dinosaur discoveries.

&quot;Jurassic Park&quot;″s impact extended internationally. It started a trend of dubbing US films into Hindi for the Indian market and was the highest-grossing US film in India at the time with a gross of $3 million. In Canada, the Toronto Raptors, a National Basketball Association team founded in 1995, was named so as a result of the film&#x27;s popularity. In addition, fans watch the team&#x27;s playoff games on a large television at Maple Leaf Square, nicknamed Jurassic Park.

===Franchise===
&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was the beginning of a multimedia franchise. Following the film&#x27;s success, Crichton wrote a sequel novel, titled &quot;The Lost World&quot; and released in 1995. Spielberg and Koepp returned respectively as director and writer for the 1997 film adaptation, &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. Crichton did not write any further novels in the series, although additional films would be made, featuring previously unused elements from the two books. Spielberg has served as executive producer for subsequent films, which include &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; (2001), &quot;Jurassic World&quot; (2015), &quot;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&quot; (2018), &quot;Jurassic World Dominion&quot; (2022), and &quot;Jurassic World Rebirth&quot; (2025). The original film remains the highest rated among critics.

The film&#x27;s story was originally continued in numerous comics, starting in 1993. Two video game sequels, &quot;Jurassic Park 2: The Chaos Continues&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition&quot;, would also be released in 1994. &quot;Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis&quot;, based on the film&#x27;s concept of building a dinosaur theme park, was released in 2003. Two subsequent games are set shortly after the events of the film – &quot;Jurassic Park: The Game&quot;, released in 2011; and the upcoming &quot;Jurassic Park: Survival&quot;, announced in 2023.

The film&#x27;s success also resulted in theme park attractions, with Jurassic Park: The Ride opening at Universal Studios Hollywood in 1996. Other Universal parks would subsequently add their own &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; rides. Islands of Adventure, opened in Orlando, Florida in 1999, has an entire section dedicated to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; that includes many rides and attractions.

<doc id="68489" wikidata="Q179815" url="?curid=68489" title="Durham, England">
<text>Durham ( , locally ) is a cathedral city and civil parish in the county of Durham, England. It is the county town and contains the headquarters of Durham County Council, the unitary authority which governs the district of County Durham. The built-up area had a population of 50,510 at the 2021 Census.

The city was built on a meander of the River Wear, which surrounds the centre on three sides and creates a narrow neck on the fourth. The surrounding land is hilly, except along the Wear&#x27;s floodplain to the north and southeast.

Durham was founded in 995 by Anglo-Saxon monks seeking a place safe from Viking raids to house the relics of St Cuthbert. The church the monks built lasted only a century, as it was replaced by the present Durham Cathedral after the Norman Conquest; together with Durham Castle it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. From the 1070s until 1836 the city was part of the County Palatine of Durham, a semi-independent jurisdiction ruled by the prince bishops of Durham which acted as a geopolitical buffer between the kingdoms of England and Scotland. In 1346, the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross was fought half a mile west of the city, resulting in an English victory. In 1650, the cathedral was used to house Scottish prisoners after their defeat at the Battle of Dunbar. During the Industrial Revolution, the Durham coalfield was heavily exploited, with dozens of collieries operating around the city and in nearby villages. Although these coal pits have now closed, the annual Durham Miners&#x27; Gala continues and is a major event for the city and region. Historically, Durham was also known for the manufacture of hosiery, carpets, and mustard.

The city is the home of Durham University, which was founded in 1832 and therefore has a claim to be the third-oldest university in England. The university is a significant employer in the region, alongside the local council and national government at the land registry and passport office. The University Hospital of North Durham and HM Prison Durham are also located close to the city centre. The city also has significant tourism and hospitality sectors.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Durham&quot; comes from the Brythonic element , signifying a hill fort, and the Old Norse , which translates as island. The Lord Bishop of Durham uses a Latin variation of the city&#x27;s name in his official signature, which is signed &quot;&quot;N.&quot; Dunelm&quot;. Some attribute the city&#x27;s name to the legend of the Dun Cow and the milkmaid who in legend guided the monks of Lindisfarne carrying the body of Saint Cuthbert to the site of the present city in 995 AD. Dun Cow Lane is said to be one of the first streets in Durham, being directly to the east of Durham Cathedral and taking its name from a depiction of the city&#x27;s founding etched in masonry on the south side of the cathedral. The city has been known by a number of names throughout history. The original Nordic &quot;Dun Holm&quot; was changed to &quot;Duresme&quot; by the Normans and was known in Latin as . The modern form &quot;Durham&quot; came into use later in the city&#x27;s history. The north-eastern historian Robert Surtees chronicled the name changes in his &quot;History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham&quot; but states that it is an &quot;impossibility&quot; to tell when the city&#x27;s modern name came into being.

Durham is likely to be in Armes Prydein, derived from Brittonic &quot;cajr&quot; meaning &quot;an enclosed, defensible site, fort&quot; from Latin , “fort, military settlement” (&quot;cf.&quot; Carlisle; Welsh ) and the river-name &quot;Wear&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
Archeological evidence suggests a history of settlement in the area since roughly 2000 BC. The present city can clearly be traced back to AD 995, when a group of monks from Lindisfarne chose the strategic high peninsula as a place to settle with the body of Saint Cuthbert, that had previously lain in Chester-le-Street, founding a church there.

===City origins, the Dun Cow story ===

Local legend states that the city was founded in A.D. 995 by divine intervention. The 12th-century chronicler Symeon of Durham recounts that after wandering in the north, Saint Cuthbert&#x27;s bier miraculously came to a halt at the hill of Warden Law and, despite the effort of the congregation, would not move. Aldhun, Bishop of Chester-le-Street and leader of the order, decreed a holy fast of three days, accompanied by prayers to the saint. During the fast, Saint Cuthbert appeared to a certain monk named Eadmer, with instructions that the coffin should be taken to Dun Holm. After Eadmer&#x27;s revelation, Aldhun found that he was able to move the bier, but did not know where Dun Holm was.

The legend of the Dun Cow, which is first documented in &quot;The Rites of Durham&quot;, an anonymous account about Durham Cathedral, published in 1593, builds on Symeon&#x27;s account. According to this legend, by chance later that day, the monks came across a milkmaid at Mount Joy (southeast of present-day Durham). She stated that she was seeking her lost dun cow, which she had last seen at Dun Holm. The monks, realising that this was a sign from the saint, followed her. They settled at a wooded &quot;hill-island&quot; – a high wooded rock surrounded on three sides by the River Wear. There they erected a shelter for the relics, on the spot where Durham Cathedral would later stand. Symeon states that a modest wooden building erected there shortly thereafter was the first building in the city. Bishop Aldhun subsequently had a stone church built, which was dedicated in September 998. This no longer remains, having been supplanted by the Norman structure.

The legend is interpreted by a Victorian relief stone carving on the north face of the cathedral and, more recently, by the bronze sculpture &#x27;Durham Cow&#x27; (1997, Andrew Burton), which reclines by the River Wear in view of the cathedral.

===Medieval era===
During the medieval period the city gained spiritual prominence as the final resting place of Saint Cuthbert and Saint Bede the Venerable. The shrine of Saint Cuthbert, situated behind the High Altar of Durham Cathedral, was the most important religious site in England until the martyrdom of St Thomas Becket at Canterbury in 1170.

Saint Cuthbert became famous for two reasons. Firstly, the miraculous healing powers he had displayed in life continued after his death, with many stories of those visiting the saint&#x27;s shrine being cured of all manner of diseases. This led to him being known as the &quot;wonder worker of England&quot;. Secondly, after the first translation of his relics in 698 AD, his body was found to be incorruptible. Apart from a brief translation back to Holy Island during the Norman Invasion the saint&#x27;s relics have remained enshrined to the present day. Saint Bede&#x27;s bones are also entombed in the cathedral, and these also drew medieval pilgrims to the city.

Durham&#x27;s geographical position has always given it an important place in the defence of England against the Scots. The city played an important part in the defence of the north, and Durham Castle is the only Norman castle keep never to have suffered a breach. In 1314, the Bishopric of Durham paid the Scots a &#x27;large sum of money&#x27; not to burn Durham. The Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross took place around half a mile west of the city on 17 October 1346 between the English and Scots and was a disastrous loss for the Scots.

The city suffered from plague outbreaks in 1544, 1589 and 1598.

===Bishops of Durham===

Owing to the divine providence evidenced in the city&#x27;s legendary founding, the Bishop of Durham has always enjoyed the formal title &quot;Bishop by Divine Providence&quot;, similar to the archbishops of Canterbury and York, as opposed to the style of &quot;Bishop by Divine Permission&quot; used by most bishops. However, as the north-east of England lay so far from Westminster, the bishops of Durham enjoyed extraordinary powers such as the ability to hold their own parliament, raise their own armies, appoint their own sheriffs and Justices, administer their own laws, levy taxes and customs duties, create fairs and markets, issue charters, salvage shipwrecks, collect revenue from mines, administer the forests and mint their own coins. So far-reaching were the bishop&#x27;s powers that the steward of Bishop Antony Bek commented in 1299 AD: &quot;There are two kings in England, namely the Lord King of England, wearing a crown in sign of his regality and the Lord Bishop of Durham wearing a mitre in place of a crown, in sign of his regality in the diocese of Durham&quot;. All this activity was administered from the castle and buildings surrounding the Palace Green. Many of the original buildings associated with these functions of the county palatine survive on the peninsula that constitutes the ancient city.

From 1071 to 1836 the bishops of Durham ruled the county palatine of Durham. Although the term &quot;prince bishop&quot; has been used as a helpful tool in the understanding the functions of the bishops of Durham in this era, it is not a title they would have recognised. The last bishop to rule the palatinate, Bishop William Van Mildert, is credited with the foundation of Durham University in 1832. Henry VIII curtailed some of the bishop&#x27;s powers and, in 1538, ordered the destruction of the shrine of Saint Cuthbert.

A UNESCO site describes the role of the bishops in the &quot;buffer state between England and Scotland&quot;:From 1075, the Bishop of Durham became a Prince-Bishop, with the right to raise an army, mint his own coins, and levy taxes. As long as he remained loyal to the king of England, he could govern as a virtually autonomous ruler, reaping the revenue from his territory, but also remaining mindful of his role of protecting England&#x27;s northern frontier.

===Legal system===
The bishops had their own court system, including most notably the Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Durham and Sadberge. The county also had its own attorney general, whose authority to bring an indictment for criminal matters was tested by central government in the case of &quot;R&quot; v &quot;Mary Ann Cotton&quot; (1873). 
Certain courts and judicial posts for the county were abolished by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873. Section 2 of the Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836 and section 41 of the Courts Act 1971 abolished others.

===Civil War and Cromwell (1640 to 1660)===

The city remained loyal to King Charles I in the English Civil War – from 1642 to the execution of the king in 1649. Charles I came to Durham three times during his reign of 1625–1649. Firstly, he came in 1633
to the cathedral for a majestic service in which he was entertained by the Chapter and Bishop at great expense. He returned during preparations for the First Bishops&#x27; War (1639).
His final visit to the city came towards the end of the civil war; he escaped from the city as Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s forces got closer.
Local legend
 stated that he escaped down the Bailey and through Old Elvet. Another local legend has it that Cromwell stayed in a room in the present Royal County Hotel on Old Elvet during the civil war. The room is reputed to be haunted by his ghost. Durham suffered greatly during the civil war (1642–1651) and Commonwealth (1649–1660). This was not due to direct assault by Cromwell or his allies, but to the abolition of the Church of England and the closure of religious institutions pertaining to it. The city has always relied upon the Dean and Chapter and cathedral as an economic force.

The castle suffered considerable damage and dilapidation during the Commonwealth due to the abolition of the office of bishop (whose residence it was). Cromwell confiscated the castle and sold it to the Lord Mayor of London shortly after taking it from the bishop. A similar fate befell the cathedral, it being closed in 1650 and used to incarcerate 3,000 Scottish prisoners, who were marched south after the Battle of Dunbar. Graffiti left by them can still be seen today etched into the interior stone.

At the Restoration in 1660, John Cosin (a former canon) was appointed bishop (in office: 1660–1672) and set about a major restoration project. This included the commissioning of the famous elaborate woodwork in the cathedral choir, the font cover and the Black Staircase in the castle. Bishop Cosin&#x27;s successor Bishop Lord Nathaniel Crewe (in office: 1674–1721) carried out other renovations both to the city and to the cathedral.

===18th century===
In the 18th century a plan to turn Durham into a seaport through the digging of a canal north to join the River Team, a tributary of the River Tyne near Gateshead, was proposed by John Smeaton. Nothing came of the plan, but the statue of Neptune in the Market Place was a constant reminder of Durham&#x27;s maritime possibilities.

The thought of ships docking at the Sands or Millburngate remained fresh in the minds of Durham merchants. In 1758, a new proposal hoped to make the Wear navigable from Durham to Sunderland by altering the river&#x27;s course, but the increasing size of ships made this impractical. Moreover, Sunderland had grown as the north east&#x27;s main port and centre for shipping.

In 1787, the Durham infirmary was founded.

The 18th century also saw the rise of the trade-union movement in the city.

===19th century===

The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 gave governing power of the town to an elected body. All other aspects of the Bishop&#x27;s temporal powers were abolished by the Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836 and returned to the Crown.

The Representation of the People Act 2000 and is regarded as the second most senior bishop and fourth most senior clergyman in the Church of England. The Court of Claims of 1953 granted the traditional right of the bishop to accompany the sovereign at the coronation, reflecting his seniority.

The first census, conducted in 1801, states that Durham City had a population of 7,100. The Industrial Revolution mostly passed the city by. However, the city was well known for carpet making and weaving. Although most of the mediaeval weavers who thrived in the city had left by the 19th century, the city was the home of Hugh MacKay Carpets’ factory, which produced the famous brands of axminster and tufted carpets until the factory went into administration in April 2005. Other important industries were the manufacture of mustard and coal extraction.

The Industrial Revolution also placed the city at the heart of the coalfields, the county&#x27;s main industry until the 1970s. Practically every village around the city had a coal mine and, although these have since disappeared as part of the regional decline in heavy industry, the traditions, heritage and community spirit are still evident.

The 19th century also saw the founding of Durham University thanks to the benevolence of Bishop William Van Mildert and the Chapter in 1832. Durham Castle became the first college (University College, Durham) and the bishop moved to Auckland Castle as his only residence in the county. Bishop Hatfield&#x27;s Hall (later Hatfield College, Durham) was added in 1846 specifically for the sons of poorer families, the Principal inaugurating a system new to English university life of advance fees to cover accommodation and communal dining.

The first Durham Miners&#x27; Gala was attended by 5,000 miners in 1871 in Wharton Park, and remains the largest socialist trade union event in the world.

===20th century===
Early in the 20th century, coal became depleted, with a particularly important seam worked out in 1927, and in the following Great Depression Durham was among those towns that suffered exceptionally severe hardship. However, the university expanded greatly. St John&#x27;s College and St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society were founded on the Bailey, completing the series of colleges in that area of the city. From the early 1950s to early 1970s, the university expanded to the south of the city centre. Trevelyan, Van Mildert, Collingwood, and Grey colleges were established, and new buildings for St Aidan&#x27;s and St Mary&#x27;s colleges for women, formerly housed on the Bailey, were created. The final 20th century collegiate addition came from the merger of the independent nineteenth-century colleges of the Venerable Bede and St Hild, which joined the university in 1979 as the College of St Hild and St Bede. The 1960s and 1970s also saw building on New Elvet. Dunelm House for the use of the students&#x27; union was built first, followed by Elvet Riverside, containing lecture theatres and staff offices. To the southeast of the city centre sports facilities were built at Maiden Castle, adjacent to the Iron Age fort of the same name, and the Mountjoy site was developed, starting in 1924, eventually containing the university library, administrative buildings, and facilities for the Faculty of Science.

Durham was not bombed during World War II, though one raid on the night of 30 May 1942 did give rise to the local legend of &#x27;St Cuthbert&#x27;s Mist&#x27;. This states that the Luftwaffe attempted to target Durham, but was thwarted when Cuthbert created a mist that covered both the castle and cathedral, sparing them from bombing. The exact events of the night are disputed by contemporary eyewitnesses. The event continues to be referenced within the city, including inspiring the artwork &#x27;Fogscape #03238&#x27; at Durham Lumiere 2015.

&#x27;Durham Castle and Cathedral&#x27; was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. Among the reasons given for the decision were &#x27;Durham Cathedral [being] the largest and most perfect monument of &quot;Norman&quot; style architecture in England&#x27;, and the cathedral&#x27;s vaulting being an early and experimental model of the gothic style. Other important UNESCO sites near Durham include Auckland Castle, North of England Lead Mining Museum and Beamish Museum.
==Geography==
===General===
The River Wear flows north through the city, making an incised meander which encloses the centre on three sides to form Durham&#x27;s peninsula.
At the base of the peninsula is the Market Place, which still hosts regular markets; a permanent indoor market, Durham Indoor Market, is also situated just off the Market Place. The Market Place and surrounding streets are one of the main commercial and shopping areas of the city. From the Market Place, the Bailey leads south past Palace Green; The Bailey is almost entirely owned and occupied by the university and the cathedral.

Durham is a hilly city, claiming to be built upon the symbolic seven hills. Upon the most central and prominent position high above the Wear, the cathedral dominates the skyline. The steep riverbanks are densely wooded, adding to the picturesque beauty of the city. West of the city centre, another river, the River Browney, drains south to join the Wear to the south of the city.

There are three old roads out of the Market Place: Saddler Street heads south-east, towards Elvet Bridge, the Bailey and Prebends Bridge. Elvet Bridge leads to the Elvet area of the city, Durham Prison and the south; Prebends Bridge is smaller and provides access from the Bailey to south Durham. Heading west, Silver Street leads out of the Market Place towards Framwellgate Bridge and North Road, the other main shopping area of the city. From here, the city spreads out into the Framwelgate, Crossgate, Neville&#x27;s Cross and viaduct districts, which are largely residential areas. Beyond the viaduct lie the outlying districts of Framwellgate Moor and Neville&#x27;s Cross. Heading north from the Market Place leads to Claypath. The road curves back round to the east and beyond it lie Gilesgate, Gilesgate Moor and Dragonville.

==== Green belt ====

As part of the wider Tyne and Wear Green Belt area, Durham&#x27;s portion extends beyond its urban area extents of Framwellgate Moor/Pity Me, Elvet and Belmont, it being completely surrounded by green belt. This primarily helps to maintain separation from Chester-le-Street, and restrain expansion of the city and coalescence with nearby villages such as Bearpark, Great Lumley and Sherburn. Landscape features and facilities within the green belt area include Raintonpark Wood, Belmont Viaduct, Ramside Hall, Durham City Golf Course, the River Wear, Browney and Deerness basins, and Durham University Botanic Gardens. It was first drawn up in the 1990s.

===Historical===

The historic city centre of Durham has changed little over 200 years. It is made up of the peninsula containing the cathedral, palace green, former administrative buildings for the palatine and Durham Castle. This was a strategic defensive decision by the city&#x27;s founders and gives the cathedral a striking position. So much so that Symeon of Durham stated:

To see Durham is to see the English Sion and by doing so one may save oneself a trip to Jerusalem.

Sir Walter Scott was so inspired by the view of the cathedral from South Street that he wrote &quot;Harold the Dauntless&quot;, a poem about Saxons and Vikings set in County Durham and published on 30 January 1817. The following lines from the poem are carved into a stone tablet on Prebends Bridge:
The old commercial section of the city encompasses the peninsula on three sides, following the River Wear. The peninsula was historically surrounded by the castle wall extending from the castle keep and broken by two gatehouses to the north and west of the enclosure. After extensive remodelling and &quot;much beautification&quot; by the Victorians the walls were removed with the exception of the gatehouse which is still standing on the Bailey.

The medieval city was made up of the cathedral, castle and administrative buildings on the peninsula. The outlying areas were known as the townships and owned by the bishop, the most famous of these being Gilesgate (which still contains the mediaeval St Giles Church), Claypath and Elvet.

The outlying commercial section of the city, especially around the North Road area, saw much change in the 1960s during a redevelopment spearheaded by Durham City Council; however, much of the original mediaeval street plan remains intact in the area close to the cathedral and market place. Most of the mediaeval buildings in the commercial area of the city have disappeared apart from the House of Correction and the Chapel of Saint Andrew, both under Elvet Bridge. Georgian buildings can still be found on the Bailey and Old Elvet most of which make up the colleges of Durham University.

===Climate===
The table below gives the average temperature, rainfall and sunshine figures taken between 1981 and 2010, and extreme temperatures back to 1850 for the weather station at Durham University Observatory:

Like the rest of the United Kingdom, Durham has a temperate climate. At , the average annual rainfall is lower than the national average of .

The coldest temperature recorded was in February 1895, falling to , and the hottest was in July 2022, reaching , beating the previous record from July 2019 by . The wettest day since homogeneous rainfall records began in 1876 was in September 1976, with falling in 24 hours.

===Demography===
The county town of County Durham, until 2009, Durham was located in the City of Durham local government district. This extended beyond the city, and had a total population of 87,656 in 2001, covering 186.68 square kilometres in 2007. In 2001, the unparished area of Durham had a population of 29,091, whilst the built-up area of Durham had a population of 42,939. Many of the inner city areas are now inhabited by students living in shared housing.

==Governance==

The ancient borough covering Durham was Durham and Framwelgate, which was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. In 1974 it was merged with Durham Rural District and Brandon and Byshottles Urban District to form the City of Durham district of County Durham. The district was abolished in 2009 with its responsibilities assumed by Durham County Council, a unitary authority.

Since April 2009, city status has been held by charter trustees, who are the Durham county councillors for the area of the former district. The trustees appoint the Mayor of Durham. The creation of the new City of Durham Parish Council has not affected the charter trustees.

Durham&#x27;s Member of Parliament (MP) is Mary Foy (Labour).

Durham Town Hall is located on the west side of the Market Place. The earliest part of the complex of buildings is the guildhall which dates from 1665. The town hall, at the rear, was opened in 1851 (at the same time as the indoor market, which extends beneath and either side of the hall).

A local referendum was held on creating a parish council for unparished areas of Durham City in February and March 2017, in which 66% of voters supported the proposal. The County Council approved the plans in September 2017. The City of Durham Parish Council was created on 1 April 2018, with the first elections for the 15 council seats taking place on 3 May 2018. The parish council is divided into three electoral wards, electing a total of 15 councillors. These councillors are responsible for burial grounds, allotments, play areas and some street lighting. Elections to the town council are held every four years and the most recent elections were held in May 2019.

==Landmarks==
The whole of the centre of Durham is designated a conservation area. The conservation area was first designated on 9 August 1968, and was extended on 25 November 1980. In addition to the Cathedral and Castle, Durham contains over 630 listed buildings, 569 of which are located within the city centre conservation area. Particularly notable properties include:

===Grade I listed===

===Grade II* listed===

===Grade II listed===

Durham has multiple grade II listed buildings, including:
*University Observatory
*The Chapel of the College of St Hild and St Bede
*The Victoria, a public house at 86 Hallgarth Street
* Redhills, the headquarters building of the Durham Miners&#x27; Association.
*Durham police mast, currently dismantled, at the Durham Constabulary headquarters.

===Durham Castle===

The castle was originally built in the 11th century as a projection of the Norman power in Northern England, as the population of England in the north remained rebellious following the disruption of the Norman Conquest in 1066. It is an excellent example of the early motte and bailey castles favoured by the Normans. The holder of the office of Bishop of Durham was appointed by the King to exercise royal authority on his behalf and the castle was the centre of his command.

It remained the Bishop&#x27;s Palace for the Bishops of Durham until the Bishop William Van Mildert made Bishop Auckland their primary residence. A founder of Durham University, Van Mildert gave the castle as accommodation for the institution&#x27;s first college, University College. The castle was famed for its vast Great Hall, created by Bishop Antony Bek in the early 14th century. It was the largest great hall in Britain until Bishop Richard Foxe shortened it at the end of the 15th century. However, it is still 46 feet high and over 33 yards long. The castle is still the home of University College, Durham (which is, as a result, known informally as &quot;Castle&quot;). It has been in continuous use for over 900 years.

===Religious buildings===
The Cathedral Church of Christ, Blessed Mary the Virgin and St Cuthbert of Durham, commonly referred to as Durham Cathedral was founded in its present form in AD 1093 and remains a centre for Christian worship today. It is generally regarded as one of the finest Romanesque cathedrals in Europe and the rib vaulting in the nave marks the beginning of Gothic ecclesiastical architecture. The cathedral has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with nearby Durham Castle, which faces it across Palace Green, high above the River Wear.

The cathedral houses the shrine and related treasures of Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, and these are on public view. It is also home to the head of St Oswald of Northumbria and the remains of the Venerable Bede.

The city also has other listed churches, some have been repurposed:
* Grade I listed
**St Giles, Gilesgate
**St Margaret of Antioch, Crossgate
** St Mary-le-Bow (now Durham Heritage Centre) 
*St Oswald&#x27;s, grade II* listed
* Grade II listed
**St. Cuthbert&#x27;s (Catholic)
**St. Nicholas

<text>Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protected the right to have an abortion prior to the point of fetal viability. The decision struck down many State abortion laws, and it sparked an ongoing abortion debate in the United States about whether, or to what extent, abortion should be legal, who should decide the legality of abortion, and what the role of moral and religious views in the political sphere should be. The decision also shaped debate concerning which methods the Supreme Court should use in constitutional adjudication. 

The case was brought by Norma McCorveyunder the legal pseudonym &quot;Jane Roe&quot;who, in 1969, became pregnant with her third child. McCorvey wanted an abortion but lived in Texas where abortion was only legal when necessary to save the mother&#x27;s life. Her lawyers, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, filed a lawsuit on her behalf in U.S. federal court against her local district attorney, Henry Wade, alleging that Texas&#x27;s abortion laws were unconstitutional. A special three-judge court of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas heard the case and ruled in her favor. The parties appealed this ruling to the Supreme Court. In January 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision in McCorvey&#x27;s favor holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides a fundamental &quot;right to privacy&quot;, which protects a pregnant woman&#x27;s right to an abortion. However, it also held that the right to abortion is not absolute and must be balanced against the government&#x27;s interest in protecting both women&#x27;s health and prenatal life. It resolved these competing interests by announcing a pregnancy trimester timetable to govern all abortion regulations in the United States. The Court also classified the right to abortion as &quot;fundamental&quot;, which required courts to evaluate challenged abortion laws under the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard, the most stringent level of judicial review in the United States. 

The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Roe&quot; was among the most controversial in U.S. history. &quot;Roe&quot; was criticized by many in the legal community, including some who thought that &quot;Roe&quot; reached the correct result but went about it the wrong way, and some called the decision a form of judicial activism. Others argued that &quot;Roe&quot; did not go far enough, as it was placed within the framework of civil rights rather than the broader human rights. 

The decision radically reconfigured the voting coalitions of the Republican and Democratic parties in the following decades. Anti-abortion politicians and activists sought for decades to restrict abortion or overrule the decision; polls into the 21st century showed that a plurality and a majority, especially into the late 2010s to early 2020s, opposed overruling &quot;Roe&quot;. Despite criticism of the decision, the Supreme Court reaffirmed &quot;Roe&quot;&#x27;s central holding in its 1992 decision, &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey.&quot; &quot;Casey&quot; overruled &quot;Roe&quot; trimester framework and abandoned its &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard in favor of an &quot;undue burden&quot; test.

In 2022, the Supreme Court overruled &quot;Roe&quot; in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; on the grounds that the substantive right to abortion was not &quot;deeply rooted in this Nation&#x27;s history or tradition&quot;, nor considered a right when the Due Process Clause was ratified in 1868, and was unknown in U.S. law until &quot;Roe&quot;.

==Background==

===History of abortion laws in the United States===
Abortion was a fairly common practice in the history of the United States, and was not always a public controversy. At a time when society was more concerned with the serious consequences of women becoming pregnant out of wedlock, family affairs were handled out of public view. The criminality of abortion at common law is a matter of debate by historians and legal scholars.

In 1821, Connecticut passed the first state statute legislating abortion in the United States; it forbade the use of poisons in abortion. After the 1840s, there was an upsurge in abortions. In the 19th century, the medical profession was generally opposed to abortion, which Mohr argues arose due to competition between men with medical degrees and women without one. The practice of abortion was one of the first medical specialties, and was practiced by unlicensed people; well-off people had abortions and paid well. The press played a key role in rallying support for anti-abortion laws. According to James S. Witherspoon, a former briefing attorney for the Court of Appeals for the Third Supreme Judicial District of Texas, abortion was not legal before quickening in 27 out of all 37 states in 1868; by the end of 1883, 30 of the 37 states, six of the ten U.S. territories, and the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, where abortion had once been common, had codified laws that restricted abortion before quickening. More than 10 states allowed pre-quickening abortions, before the quickening distinction was eliminated, and every state had anti-abortion laws by 1900.

In the United States, before specific statutes were made against it, abortion was sometimes considered a common law offense, such as by William Blackstone and James Wilson. In all states throughout the 19th and early 20th century, pre-quickening abortions were always considered to be actions without a lawful purpose. This meant that if the mother died, the individual performing the abortion was guilty of murder. This aspect of common law regarded pre-quickening abortions as a type of inchoate offense. Negative liberty rights from common law do not apply in situations caused by consensual or voluntary behavior, which allowed for abortions of fetuses conceived in a consensual manner to be common law offenses. The majority opinion for &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; authored in Justice Harry Blackmun&#x27;s name would later state that the criminalization of abortion did not have &quot;roots in the English common-law tradition&quot;, and was thought to return to the more permissive state of pre-1820s abortion laws. One purpose for banning abortion was to preserve the life of the fetus, another was to protect the life of the mother, another was to create deterrence against future abortions, and another was to avoid injuring the mother&#x27;s ability to have children. Judges did not always distinguish between which purpose was more important. Rather than arresting the women having the abortions, legal officials were more likely to interrogate them to obtain evidence against the individual doing the abortions. This law enforcement strategy was a response to juries which refused to convict women prosecuted for abortion in the 19th century. In 1973, Justice Blackmun&#x27;s opinion stated that &quot;the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage&quot;.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, opposition to abortion was concentrated among members of the political left and the Democratic Party, although feminists within predominately supported legalization. Most liberal Catholics and Mainline Protestants (both of which tended to vote for the Democratic Party) opposed liberalizing laws surrounding abortion while most other Protestants, including evangelicals, supported doing so as a matter of religious liberty, what they saw as a lack of biblical condemnation, and belief in non-intrusive government.

By 1971, elective abortion on demand was effectively available in Alaska, California, Hawaii, New York, Washington, and Washington, D.C. Some women traveled to jurisdictions where it was legal, although not all could afford to. In 1971, Shirley Wheeler was charged with manslaughter after Florida hospital staff reported her illegal abortion to the police. Wheeler was one of a few women who were prosecuted by their states for abortion. She received a sentence of two years probation, and as an option under her probation, chose to move back into her parents&#x27; house in North Carolina. The Playboy Foundation donated $3,500 to her defense fund and &quot;Playboy&quot; denounced her prosecution. The Boston Women&#x27;s Abortion Coalition raised money and held a rally where attendees listened to speakers from the Women&#x27;s National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC). Her conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court of Florida.

===History of the case===
Sarah Weddington recruited Linda Coffee to help her with abortion litigation. Their first plaintiffs were a married couple; they joined after the woman heard Coffee give a speech. The intended suit would state abortions were medically necessary for the woman. The woman had a neurochemical disorder and it was considered medically necessary that she not give birth or raise children, yet they did not want to abstain from sex, and contraception might fail. The attorneys were concerned about standing since the woman was not pregnant. Weddington later wrote that they &quot;needed to find a pregnant Texas woman who wanted an abortion and would be willing to be a plaintiff.&quot; They also wanted to increase the likelihood that the panel selection would help them win in court. They wanted to present their case to a three-judge panel which included a judge they thought would be sympathetic, which was a possibility only by filing a case in Dallas. If either of the two cases they filed in Dallas were assigned favorably, they intended to ask for the other one to be consolidated with it.

At first, Weddington was unsuccessful in finding a suitable pregnant woman. In June 1969, 21-year-old Norma McCorvey discovered she was pregnant with her third child. Ordinarily, lawyers are not allowed to directly solicit clients without any prior relationship, but McCorvey&#x27;s situation qualified for an exception in the no solicitation rule which allows lawyers to solicit new clients for public interest cases. According to a sworn statement made in 2003, McCorvey asked if she had what was needed to be part of Weddington and Coffee&#x27;s lawsuit. She recounted being told, &quot;Yes. You&#x27;re white. You&#x27;re young, pregnant, and you want an abortion.&quot; Both McCorvey&#x27;s whiteness and her lower social class were crucial factors in the attorneys&#x27; choice to have her as their plaintiff.

McCorvey recounted that the lawyers asked if she thought abortion should be legal. McCorvey said she did not know. Weddington told her, &quot;It&#x27;s just a piece of tissue. You just missed your period.&quot; This convinced McCorvey that abortion should be legal. She agreed to let them represent her under the impression that she would be able to eventually get a legal abortion. She smoked an illegal drug and drank wine so she would not have to think about her pregnancy. McCorvey gave birth to a daughter at Dallas Osteopathic Hospital on June 2, 1970; the baby, Shelley Lynn Thornton, was adopted by a couple in Texas.

In 1970, Coffee and Weddington filed &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; as a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on behalf of McCorvey under the legal pseudonym &quot;Jane Roe&quot;, and they also filed &quot;Does v. Wade&quot; on behalf of the married couple. The defendant for both cases was Dallas County District Attorney, Henry Wade, who represented the State of Texas. Weddington later stated that she &quot;saw &quot;Roe&quot; as part of a much larger effort by many attorneys&quot; whose collective interests she represented. James H. Hallford was a physician who was in the process of being prosecuted for performing two abortions. The Court allowed him to join the suit as a physician-intervenor on behalf of Jane Roe.

One of the cases was assigned to a panel of judges which included Judge Sarah T. Hughes, who they thought would be sympathetic, and the cases were consolidated. In accordance with the Court&#x27;s rules, two of the judges hearing the consolidated case were assigned on the basis of their judicial district, and the third judge on the panel was a circuit court judge chosen by the Chief Justice of the United States.

The consolidated lawsuit was heard by a three-judge panel consisting of district court judges Sarah T. Hughes and William McLaughlin Taylor Jr. and appellate judge Irving Loeb Goldberg of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Hughes knew Coffee, who clerked for her from 1968 to 1969. Additionally, the backgrounds of two other judges also gave Weddington and Coffee hope they would be successful. On June 17, 1970, the three judges unanimously ruled in McCorvey&#x27;s favor and declared the Texas law unconstitutional, finding that it violated the right to privacy found in the Ninth Amendment. The court relied on Justice Arthur Goldberg&#x27;s 1965 concurrence in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;. Yet the Court also declined to grant an injunction against enforcing the law, and ruled against the married couple on the basis that they lacked standing. Since Wade said he would continue to prosecute people for performing abortions, the lack of an injunction meant that McCorvey could not get an abortion.

==Hearing the case==
===Postponement===
&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; reached the Supreme Court when both sides appealed in 1970. It bypassed the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit because 28 USC § 1253 authorizes a direct appeal to the Supreme Court in cases concerning the granting or denial of a civil injunction decided by a three judge panel.
The case continued under the name &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; instead of being switched to &quot;Wade v. Roe&quot;. The justices delayed taking action on &quot;Roe&quot; and a closely related case, &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot;, until they had first decided certain other cases. One case they decided first was &quot;Younger v. Harris&quot;. The justices felt the appeals raised difficult questions on judicial jurisdiction.

Another case was &quot;United States v. Vuitch&quot;, in which they considered the constitutionality of a District of Columbia statute which banned abortion except when the mother&#x27;s life or health was endangered. The Court upheld the statute on the grounds that the word &quot;health&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague and placed the burden of proof concerning dangers to the life or health of the mother on the prosecutor instead of on the person who had performed the abortion.

Justice William O. Douglas wrote a lengthy dissenting opinion to this case. He argued that the right to marital privacy and the limitation of family size from &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; also applied here, although he acknowledged that &quot;on the other side is the belief of many that the fetus, once formed, is a member of the human family and that mere personal inconvenience cannot justify the fetus&#x27; destruction.&quot; He also challenged the majority opinion with a series of hypothetical questions asking whether &quot;health&quot; might also include the stigma of having an illegitimate child, anxiety from the pregnancy being unwanted, the physical work of raising a child, the financial drain from the added expense of another child, and far off health risks that may never actually materialize in a similar fashion to how risks were warded off with prophylactic appendectomy. Douglas&#x27; dissent made a similar legal argument to the one used two years later in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. The following day after their decision was announced, the court voted to hear both &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Doe&quot;.

According to Blackmun, Stewart felt the cases were a straightforward application of &quot;Younger v. Harris&quot;, and enough justices agreed to hear the cases to review whether they would be suitable for federal as opposed to only state courts. This sort of review was not about the constitutionality of abortion and would not have required evidence, witnesses, or a record of facts. The oral argument was scheduled by the full Court for December 13, 1971. Before the Court could hear the oral argument, Justices Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II retired. Chief Justice Warren Burger asked Justice Potter Stewart and Justice Blackmun to determine whether &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Doe&quot;, among others, should be heard as scheduled. They recommended that the Court continue on as scheduled.

===Oral argument===
As she began speaking for the oral argument, Sarah Weddington was unaware that the Court had decided to hear the case to decide which courts had jurisdiction to hear it rather than as an attempt to overturn abortion laws in a broad ruling. She began by bringing up constitutional reasons why the Court should overturn Texas&#x27;s abortion law, but Justice Stewart asked questions directed towards the jurisdiction question instead. Weddington replied that she saw no problem with jurisdiction and continued to talk about a constitutional right to abortion. Overall, she spent between 20 and 30 minutes discussing jurisdiction and procedure instead of constitutional issues.

In his opening argument in defense of the abortion restrictions, attorney Jay Floyd made what was later described as the &quot;worst joke in legal history&quot;. Appearing against two female lawyers, Floyd began, &quot;Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. It&#x27;s an old joke, but when a man argues against two beautiful ladies like this, they are going to have the last word.&quot; His remark was met with cold silence; abortion rights lawyer Margie Pitts Hames thought that Chief Justice Burger &quot;was going to come right off the bench at him. He glared him down.&quot;

McCorvey did not attend either of the oral arguments along with her two lawyers. After talking McCorvey out of getting an illegal abortion and getting her name signed on an affidavit for the lawsuit, Weddington did not speak again with McCorvey until four months after &quot;Roe&quot; was decided.

===Initial discussions===
After the first argument session, Burger assigned the task of writing the Court&#x27;s opinions for both &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Doe&quot; to Blackmun. Douglas suggested to Blackmun that Burger assigned the opinions to him out of malicious intention, but Blackmun disagreed. He knew that Burger could not write it himself because the subject of abortion was too controversial, and his opinions might get rejected by the majority. He also understood why the other justices could not be assigned to write the opinions: Douglas was too liberal for the public to accept his word. Likewise, he might split the Court&#x27;s vote by writing something radical. In addition, the quality of his opinions had suffered recently. Brennan was the only Catholic on the Court, and he would have to face Catholic political groups which were against abortion. If Marshall wrote the opinions, the ruling would be perceived as being directed towards African Americans, and he would have to face the displeasure of African American political groups. Stewart would have trouble going far enough in legalizing abortion.

At this point, Black and Harlan had been replaced by William Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell Jr., but the first argument had already occurred before they became Supreme Court justices. Justice Blackmun worked on a preliminary opinion for &quot;Roe&quot; which argued that Texas&#x27;s law was unconstitutionally vague. This approach accommodated the claims of some doctors who were concerned that prosecutors might disagree with them over what constituted &quot;life&quot;. Blackmun thought this approach would be a good way to avoid controversy which would come with saying there was a fundamental right to abortion. Brennan and Douglas disagreed with Blackmun and wrote to him that instead he needed to focus on privacy. After communicating with the other justices, Blackmun felt that his opinion did not adequately reflect his liberal colleagues&#x27; views. In March 1972, the court issued a ruling in &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot;, a landmark case which applied the earlier marital privacy right now also to unmarried individuals.

Douglas wrote to Blackmun in May 1972 that he thought there were four judges who were definitely willing to rule in the majority—himself, Brennan, Stewart, and Marshall. Blackmun at one point thought all seven justices wanted to vote in the majority.

In May 1972, Blackmun proposed that the case be reargued. Justice Douglas threatened to write a dissent from the reargument order because he and the other liberal justices were suspicious that Rehnquist and Powell would vote to uphold the Texas abortion statutes. He was coaxed out of the action by his colleagues, and instead his dissent was merely mentioned in the reargument order without further statement or opinion. The case was reargued on October 11, 1972. Weddington continued to represent the pseudonymous Jane Roe, and Texas Assistant Attorney General Robert C. Flowers replaced Jay Floyd for Texas.

A June 1972 memo written by Douglas to his colleagues discussing the case was leaked to and published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; before the decision was published.

===Drafting the opinion===

Blackmun continued to work on his opinions in both cases over the summer recess, even though there was no guarantee that he would be assigned to write them again. Over the recess, he spent a week researching the history of abortion at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, where he had worked in the 1950s. He talked daily on the phone with George Frampton, his 28-year-old law clerk who stayed behind in Washington, D.C. Frampton researched the history of abortion using a book authored by Lawrence Lader, the founding chairman of what is now called NARAL Pro-Choice America. Blackmun&#x27;s papers made available since his death contain at least seven citations for Lader&#x27;s 1966 book, &quot;Abortion&quot;. Chapter 16 of his book, &quot;A Blueprint for Changing U.S. Abortion Laws&quot; predicted that if abortion were to be legalized, &quot;the possibility of community opposition is slight&quot;. Lader also predicted that &quot;If such a theoretical case was carried to a high court, perhaps even the U.S. Supreme Court, and the judges confirmed a broad interpretation of the meaning of a threat to life, undoubtedly a landmark in abortion decisions would be reached.&quot;

The historical survey for &quot;Roe&quot; also referenced two articles by Cyril Means, who served as counsel to NARAL. In the articles, Means misrepresented the common law tradition in ways that were helpful to the &quot;Roe&quot; side. Roy Lucas, the principal attorney assisting Weddington and Coffee, had previously received a memo from his colleague David M. Tundermann about Means&#x27;s scholarship. The memo stated that the conclusions in Means&#x27;s articles &quot;sometimes strain credibility.&quot; It also stated:
Where the important thing is to win the case no matter how, however, I suppose I agree with Means&#x27;s technique: begin with a scholarly attempt at historical research; if it doesn&#x27;t work, fudge it as necessary; write a piece so long that others will read only your introduction and conclusion; then keep citing it until courts begin picking it up. This preserves the guise of impartial scholarship while advancing the proper ideological goals.

After the Court held the second argument session, Powell said he would agree with Blackmun&#x27;s conclusion but pushed for &quot;Roe&quot; to be the lead of the two abortion cases being considered. Powell also suggested that the Court strike down the Texas law on privacy grounds. Byron White was unwilling to sign on to Blackmun&#x27;s opinion, and Justice Rehnquist had already decided to dissent.

During the drafting process, the justices discussed the trimester framework at great length. Powell had suggested that the point where the state could intervene be placed at viability, which Thurgood Marshall supported as well. In an internal memo to the other justices before the majority decision was published, Justice Blackmun wrote: &quot;You will observe that I have concluded that the end of the first trimester is critical. This is arbitrary, but perhaps any other selected point, such as quickening or viability, is equally arbitrary.&quot; In the same memo he suggested that the end of the first trimester seemed more likely to get support from other justices and allowed states the ability to adjust their statutes. He was of the impression that doctors were concerned that recovering abortion patients would take up too many hospital beds, and that abortion patients later than the first trimester were more likely to require hospital beds than those whose fetuses were aborted earlier. Contrary to the justices who preferred viability, Douglas preferred the first-trimester line. Stewart said the lines were &quot;legislative&quot; and wanted more flexibility and consideration paid to state legislatures, though he joined Blackmun&#x27;s decision. William Brennan proposed abandoning frameworks based on the age of the fetus and instead allowing states to regulate the procedure based on its safety for the mother.

== Supreme Court decision ==
On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision in favor of &quot;Jane Roe&quot; (Norma McCorvey) holding that women in the United States had a fundamental right to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction and striking down Texas&#x27;s abortion ban as unconstitutional. The decision was issued together with a decision in a companion case, &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot;, which involved a similar challenge to Georgia&#x27;s abortion laws.

Larry Hammond, a law clerk for Powell, gave a &quot;Time&quot; reporter a copy of the decision &quot;on background&quot;, expecting that it would be issued by the court before the next issue of &quot;Time&quot; was published; however, due to a delay in the decision&#x27;s release, the text of the decision appeared on newsstands a few hours before it was published by the court. Burger demanded a meeting with &quot;Time&quot; editors and punishment for the leaker. Powell refused Hammond&#x27;s resignation, on the grounds that &quot;Hammond had been double-crossed&quot; by the reporter.

===Opinion of the Court===

Justice Harry Blackmun authored the opinion of the Courtthe &quot;majority opinion&quot;and was joined by six other justices: Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Potter Stewart, William J. Brennan Jr., William O. Douglas, Thurgood Marshall, and Lewis F. Powell Jr.

==== Mootness ====
After reciting the facts of the case, the Court&#x27;s opinion first addressed several legal questions involving procedure and justiciability. These included mootness, a legal doctrine that prevents American federal courts from hearing cases that have ceased to be &quot;live&quot; controversies because of intervening events. Under a normal application of the doctrine, McCorvey&#x27;s appeal would have been considered moot because she had already given birth to her child and therefore no longer had a pregnancy to abort.

The Court concluded that an established exception to the mootness doctrine allows consideration of cases that are &quot;capable of repetition, yet evading review&quot;. Blackmun noted that McCorvey might get pregnant again, and pregnancy would normally conclude more quickly than an appellate process: &quot;If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied.&quot;

==== Abortion and right to privacy ====
After dealing with mootness and standing, the Court proceeded to the main issue of the case: the constitutionality of Texas&#x27;s abortion law. The Court first surveyed the status of abortion throughout the history of Roman law and the English and early American common law. It also reviewed the developments of medical procedures and technology used in abortions.

Following its historical surveys, the Court introduced the concept of a constitutional &quot;right to privacy&quot; that it said had been intimated in earlier decisions such as &quot;Meyer v. Nebraska&quot; and &quot;Pierce v. Society of Sisters&quot;, which involved parental control over childrearing, and &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, which involved the use of contraception. Then, &quot;with virtually no further explanation of the privacy value&quot;, the Court ruled that regardless of exactly which provisions were involved, the U.S. Constitution and its guarantees of liberty covered a right to privacy that protected a pregnant woman&#x27;s decision whether to abort a pregnancy.

The Court reasoned that outlawing abortions would infringe a pregnant woman&#x27;s right to privacy for several reasons: having unwanted children &quot;may force upon the woman a distressful life and future&quot;; it may bring imminent psychological harm; caring for the child may tax the mother&#x27;s physical and mental health; and because there may be &quot;distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child&quot;. However, the Court rejected the notion that this right to privacy was absolute. It held instead that a woman&#x27;s right to have an abortion must be balanced against other government interests, such as protecting maternal health and protecting the life of the fetus. The Court held that these government interests were sufficiently compelling to permit states to impose some limits on pregnant women&#x27;s right to choose to have an abortion.

Texas&#x27;s lawyers had argued that limiting abortion to situations where the mother&#x27;s life was in danger was justified because life began at the moment of conception, and therefore the state&#x27;s governmental interest in protecting prenatal life applied to all pregnancies regardless of their stage. The Court said that there was no indication that the Constitution&#x27;s uses of the word &quot;person&quot; were meant to include fetuses, and it rejected Texas&#x27;s argument that a fetus should be considered a &quot;person&quot; with a legal and constitutional right to life. The Court observed that there was still great disagreement over when an unborn fetus becomes a living being.


To balance women&#x27;s rights to privacy and state governments&#x27; interests in protecting mothers&#x27; health and prenatal life, the Court created the trimester framework. During the first trimester, when it was believed that the procedure was safer than childbirth, the Court ruled that a state government could place no restrictions on women&#x27;s ability to choose to abort pregnancies other than imposing minimal medical safeguards, such as requiring abortions to be performed by licensed physicians. From the second trimester on, the Court ruled that evidence of increasing risks to the mother&#x27;s health gave states a compelling interest that allowed them to enact medical regulations on abortion procedures so long as they were reasonable and &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; to protecting mothers&#x27; health. From the beginning of the third trimester on—the point at which a fetus became viable under the medical technology available in the early 1970s—the Court ruled that a state&#x27;s interest in protecting prenatal life became so compelling that it could legally prohibit all abortions except where necessary to protect the mother&#x27;s life or health.

Having completed its analysis, the Court concluded that Texas&#x27;s abortion statutes were unconstitutional and struck them down.
==== Concurrences ====
Three justices from the majority filed concurring opinions in the case. Justice Potter Stewart wrote a concurring opinion in which he said that even though the Constitution makes no mention of the right to choose to have an abortion without interference, he thought the Court&#x27;s decision was a permissible interpretation of the doctrine of substantive due process, which says that the Due Process Clause protection of liberty extends beyond simple procedures and protects certain fundamental rights. Justice William O. Douglas&#x27;s concurring opinion described his view that although the Court was correct to find that the right to choose to have an abortion was a fundamental right, he thought it would have been better to derive it from the Ninth Amendmentwhich states that the fact that a right is not specifically enumerated in the Constitution shall not be construed to mean that American people do not possess itrather than through the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Due Process Clause.

Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote a concurrence in which he wrote that he thought it would be permissible to allow a state to require two physicians to certify an abortion before it could be performed. His concurrence also states:I do not read the Court&#x27;s holdings today as having the sweeping consequences attributed to them by the dissenting Justices; the dissenting views discount the reality that the vast majority of physicians observe the standards of their profession, and act only on the basis of carefully deliberated medical judgments relating to life and health. Plainly, the Court today rejects any claim that the Constitution requires abortions on demand.

This has been interpreted as Chief Justice Burger thinking that medical standards and judgment would restrict the number of abortions. Instead of the law restricting abortions to limited circumstances as pre-&quot;Roe&quot;, now doctors would get to do the restricting.

This understanding of &quot;Roe&quot; appears to be related to several statements in the majority opinion. Justice Blackmun&#x27;s majority opinion states, &quot;the attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the state, that, in his medical judgment, the patient&#x27;s pregnancy should be terminated.&quot; It also states, &quot;For the stage, prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman&#x27;s attending physician.&quot; Six days prior to January 22, Justice Blackmun prepared &quot;a transcript of what I shall say, and there should be at least some reason for the press not going all the way off the deep end.&quot; The unissued news release stated:
...the Court does not today hold that the Constitution compels abortion on demand. It does not today pronounce that a pregnant woman has an absolute right to abortion. It does, for the first trimester of pregnancy, cast the abortion decision and the responsibility for it upon the attending physician.

These statements appear to indicate that the justices voting in the majority thought that patients had personal physicians. Earlier in American history it was once common for people to have individual doctors, but the nature of doctor-patient relationship had already changed prior to &quot;Roe&quot;.

==== Dissents ====

Two justices, Byron White and William Rehnquist, dissented from the Court&#x27;s decision. White&#x27;s dissent, which was issued with &quot;Roe&quot; companion case, &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot;, argued that the Court had no basis for deciding between the competing values of pregnant women and unborn children: 

White also argued that the legality of abortion, &quot;for the most part, should be left with the people and the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs.&quot;
Rehnquist&#x27;s dissent compared the majority&#x27;s use of substantive due process to the Court&#x27;s repudiated use of the doctrine in the 1905 case &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;. He elaborated on several of White&#x27;s points and asserted that the Court&#x27;s historical analysis was flawed.
From this historical record, Rehnquist wrote, &quot;There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted.&quot; He concluded &quot;the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter.&quot;

== Reception ==
There was a strong response to the decision shortly after it was issued. The Catholic Church condemned the ruling. Prominent organized groups that responded to &quot;Roe&quot; include National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, which became the National Abortion Rights Action League in late 1973 to reflect the Court&#x27;s repeal of restrictive laws, and the National Right to Life Committee.

The legal scholar Ronald Dworkin described it as &quot;undoubtedly the best-known case the United States Supreme Court has ever decided.&quot;

=== Support for &quot;Roe&quot; and abortion rights ===
==== 1960s–1970s ====
In the 1960s, there was an alliance between the population control movement and the abortion-rights movement in the United States. Abortion rights were especially supported by younger women within the population control movement. The cooperation was mostly due to feminists who wanted some of the popularity already enjoyed by the population control movement. In addition, population control advocates thought that legalizing abortion would help solve the coming population crisis that demographers had projected.

In 1973, Hugh Moore&#x27;s Population Crisis Committee and John D. Rockefeller III&#x27;s Population Council both publicly supported abortion rights following &quot;Roe&quot;. Previously, public support for abortion rights within the population control movement instead came from less established organizations such as Zero Population Growth. An exception was Planned Parenthood-World Population, which supported repealing all laws against abortion in 1969. Together, population control and abortion rights advocates voiced the benefits of legalized abortion such as smaller welfare costs, fewer illegitimate births, and slower population growth. At the same time, the use of these arguments put them at odds with civil-rights movement leaders and Black Power activists who were concerned that abortion would be used to eliminate non-whites. H. Rap Brown denounced abortion as &quot;black genocide&quot;, and Dick Gregory said that his &quot;answer to genocide, quite simply, is eight Black kids and another one on the way.&quot;

Soon after &quot;Roe&quot;, the population control movement suffered setbacks, which caused the movement to lose political support and instead appear divisive. On June 27, 1973, a lawsuit was filed concerning the Relf sisters, 14-year-old Minnie Lee and her 12-year-old sister Alice Lee. A worker at a federally-funded family planning clinic lied to their illiterate mother, saying they would get birth control shots. Instead, the Relf sisters were sterilized without their knowledge or consent. During the next fifteen months, 80 additional women came forward about their forced sterilizations, all belonging to minority races. Concerns rose that abortions would also become compulsory. During the 1974 World Population Conference in Bucharest, Romania, most developing nations argued that the developed nations&#x27; focus on population growth was an attempt to avoid solving the deeper causes of underdevelopment, such as the unequal structure of international relations. Instead, they wanted more favorable terms under the New International Economic Order. A draft plan with fertility targets was strongly opposed by the developing countries, which surprised the delegations from the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. The final plan omitted fertility targets and instead stated, &quot;A population policy may have a certain success if it constitutes an integral part of socio-economic development.&quot;

As members questioned the political benefits of population control rhetoric, the abortion-rights movement distanced itself from the population control movement. In October 1973, Robin Elliott circulated a memo to other Planned Parenthood members concerning opposition to &quot;Planned Parenthood&#x27;s credibility in its reference to the population problem&quot;. Instead, she thought they should use &quot;Roe&quot; inspired rhetoric about &quot;the reaffirmation of commitment to freedom of choice in parenthood.&quot; By 1978, a NARAL handbook denounced population control.

==== 21st century ====

Into the 21st century, advocates of &quot;Roe&quot; describe it as vital to the preservation of women&#x27;s rights, personal freedom, bodily integrity, and privacy. Advocates have also reasoned that access to safe abortion and reproductive freedom generally are fundamental rights. Supporters of &quot;Roe&quot; contend that even if abortion rights are also supported by another portion of the constitution, the decision in 1973 accurately founds the right in the Fourteenth Amendment. Others support &quot;Roe&quot; despite concern that the fundamental right to abortion is found elsewhere in the Constitution but not in the portions referenced in the 1973 decision. They also tend to believe that the power balance between men and women is unequal, and that issues like access to birth control and political representation affect women&#x27;s equality.

Opinion polls in late 2021 indicated that while a majority of Americans oppose overturning &quot;Roe&quot;, a sizable minority opposed overturning &quot;Roe&quot; but also desired to make abortion illegal in ways that &quot;Roe&quot; would not permit. This was attributed to poll respondents misunderstanding &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; or misinterpreting the poll question. 2018–2019 polls showed that while 60 percent of Americans generally support abortion in the first trimester, this drops to 20 percent for the second trimester, even though &quot;Roe&quot; protects the right to abortion until the last weeks of the second trimester, and at the same time 69 percent said they would not like to see &quot;Roe&quot; overturned, compared to 29 percent who said they would like to see &quot;Roe&quot; overturned. Another poll showed that 43 percent of those who said abortion should be illegal in most or all cases opposed overturning &quot;Roe&quot;, while 26 percent of those who said abortion should be legal in most or all cases supported overturning &quot;Roe&quot;. Polls also found that men and women have similar views on abortion, which are linked to how people think about motherhood, sex, and women&#x27;s social roles; supporters of &quot;Roe&quot; and abortion rights tend to see women&#x27;s ability to make decisions about their bodies as fundamental to gender equality.

Most polls in the late 2010s and early 2020s showed overwhelming support, at between 85 and 90 percent, among Americans that abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances, which varies or drops depending on the specifics. A January 2022 CNN poll found a 59% majority of Americans want their state to have laws that are &quot;more permissive than restrictive&quot; on abortion if &quot;Roe&quot; is overturned, 20% want their state to ban abortion entirely, and another 20% want it to be restricted but not banned. In two March 2022 polls, between 61 and 64 percent of Americans said abortion should be legal in most or all cases, while between 35 and 37 percent said abortion should be illegal in most or all cases. A May 2022 Gallup poll showed that 50% of Americans thought abortions should be legal under certain circumstances, with 35% saying it should be legal under any circumstances, and 15% saying it should be illegal in all circumstances, as well as a record number of Americans who identify as &quot;pro-choice&quot;.

Before &quot;Roe&quot; was overturned in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, a majority of Americans thought that &quot;Roe&quot; was safe and would not be overturned. Since the draft&#x27;s leaks showed &quot;Roe&quot; to be overturned in &quot;Dobbs&quot;, as happened in June 2022, abortion became a concern and a very important issue for Democrats, who previously lagged behind Republicans on this; some Americans, in particular liberals but also a few conservatives, may have become more aware of the popular support for &quot;Roe&quot;, which they had previously understated. In June 2022, Gallup reported that a 61% majority of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 37% say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. It also recorded the highest partisan divide since 1995, compared to the mid-1970s and throughout the 1980s when both Democrats and Republicans were closer on the issue. That same month, the Congregation L&#x27;Dor Va-Dor filed a lawsuit against a new law in Florida that would outlaw abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, including in cases of rape or incest. Unlike other legal challenges to abortion restrictions in the United States that generally rely on the right to privacy established by &quot;Roe&quot;, the synagogue argued that Florida&#x27;s abortion law violates religious freedom, as &quot;Jewish law says that life begins at birth, not at conception.&quot;

=== Opposition to &quot;Roe&quot; ===
====Condemnation by Catholic Bishops====

The Catholic Church condemned the ruling by the Supreme Court. Blackmun wrote in his diary, &quot;Abortion flak—3 Cardinals—Vatican—Rochester wires!&quot;

John Cardinal Krol, the archbishop of Philadelphia who was also the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and Terence Cardinal Cooke, the archbishop of New York, both issued statements condemning the ruling. Krol called the ruling &quot;an unspeakable tragedy for this nation&quot; that &quot;sets in motion developments which are terrifying to contemplate.&quot; Cooke called the decision a &quot;horrifying action&quot; and added:

How many millions of children prior to their birth will never live to see the light of today because of the shocking action of the majority of the United States Supreme Court today?

==== Opposition to &quot;Roe&quot; but support for abortion rights ====
Some supporters of abortion rights oppose &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; on the grounds that it laid a foundation for abortion in civil rights rather than in human rights, which are broader and would require government entities to take active measures to ensure every woman has access to abortion. This particular position is indicated by the use of rhetoric concerning &quot;reproductive justice&quot;, which replaces earlier rhetoric centered around &quot;choice&quot;, such as the &quot;pro-choice&quot; label. Reproductive justice proponents contend that factors permitting choice are unequal, thus perpetuating oppression and serving to divide women. Reproductive justice advocates instead want abortion to be considered an affirmative right that the government would be obligated to guarantee equal access to, even if the women seeking abortions are nonwhite, poor, or live outside major metropolitan areas. With a broader interpretation of the right to an abortion, it would be possible to require all new obstetricians to be in favor of abortion rights, lest as professionals they employ conscience clauses and refuse to perform abortions. In the 1989 decision of &quot;Webster v. Reproductive Health Services&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled against an affirmative right to nontherapeutic abortions and noted that states would not be required to pay for them.

Some in academia have equated the denial of abortion rights to compulsory motherhood, and reason that because of this abortion bans violate the Thirteenth Amendment: &quot;When women are compelled to carry and bear children, they are subjected to &#x27;involuntary servitude&#x27; in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment. Even if the woman has stipulated to have consented to the risk of pregnancy, that does not permit the state to force her to remain pregnant.&quot; In 1993, a district court rejected an attempt to justify abortion rights apart from &quot;Roe&quot; and instead upon the basis that pregnancy and childrearing constituted involuntary servitude.

==== Opposition to both &quot;Roe&quot; and abortion rights ====

Every year, on the anniversary of the decision, opponents of abortion march up Constitution Avenue to the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C., in the March for Life. Around 250,000 people attended the march until 2010. Estimates put the 2011 and 2012 attendances at 400,000 each, and the 2013 March for Life drew an estimated 650,000 people. The march was started in October 1973 by Nellie Gray and the first march took place on January 22, 1974, to mark the first anniversary of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

Opponents of &quot;Roe&quot; say that the decision lacks a valid constitutional foundation. Like the dissenters in &quot;Roe&quot;, they maintain that the Constitution is silent on the issue, and that proper solutions to the question would best be found via state legislatures and the legislative process, rather than through an all-encompassing ruling from the Supreme Court. Another argument against the &quot;Roe&quot; decision, as articulated by former president Ronald Reagan, is that, in the absence of consensus about when meaningful life begins, it is best to avoid the risk of doing harm.

In response to &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, most states enacted or attempted to enact laws limiting or regulating abortion, such as laws requiring parental consent or parental notification for minors to obtain abortions; spousal mutual consent laws; spousal notification laws; laws requiring abortions to be performed in hospitals, not clinics; laws barring state funding for abortions; laws banning intact dilation and extraction, also known as partial-birth abortion; laws requiring waiting periods before abortions; and laws mandating that women read certain types of literature and watch a fetal ultrasound before undergoing an abortion. In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, barring the federal government from using Medicaid to fund abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the life of the mother. The Supreme Court struck down some state restrictions in a long series of cases stretching from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, but upheld restrictions on funding, including the Hyde Amendment, in the case of &quot;Harris v. McRae&quot; (1980). Some opponents of abortion maintain that personhood begins at fertilization or conception, and should therefore be protected by the Constitution; the dissenting justices in &quot;Roe&quot; instead wrote that decisions about abortion &quot;should be left with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs.&quot;

===Responses within the legal profession===
Liberal and feminist legal scholars have had various reactions to &quot;Roe&quot;, not always giving the decision unqualified support. One argument is that Justice Blackmun reached the correct result but went about it the wrong way. Another is that the end achieved by &quot;Roe&quot; does not justify its means of judicial fiat.

David Garrow said that the decision in &quot;Roe&quot; and also &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot; &quot;owed a great amount of their substance and language&quot; to Justice Blackmun&#x27;s law clerks, George Frampton and Randall Bezanson. He thought the extent of their contributions were remarkable, and that the clerks exhibited an &quot;unusually assertive and forceful manner&quot; in voicing their views to Justice Blackmun. In his research, it was the earliest significant example he found of this behavior pattern, which grew more consistent later on. In Garrow&#x27;s evaluation, the clerks&#x27; contributions were &quot;historically significant and perhaps decisive&quot; in shaping the two decisions.

In response to Garrow, Edward Lazarus said that Justice Blackmun&#x27;s later clerks like himself did not need as much direction on reproductive rights since they had Justice Blackmun&#x27;s prior opinions to draw from. Lazarus thought that on at least some occasions when legal formulations were created for opinions to be published in Justice Blackmun&#x27;s name, the justice himself was not engaged in originating every significant thought pattern that they employed. Lazarus agreed that Garrow&#x27;s depiction of how the trimester framework came about was an example of one of these occasions. He concluded: &quot;The problem of excessive clerk delegation was less serious in Blackmun&#x27;s chambers than Garrow suggests but is also more commonplace among the justices. The modern Supreme Court has deep problems in its decisional culture and the overuse of law clerks is an aspect of this.&quot;

Justice John Paul Stevens, while agreeing with the decision, suggested that it should have been more narrowly focused on the issue of privacy. According to Stevens, if the decision had avoided the trimester framework and simply stated that the right to privacy included a right to choose abortion, &quot;it might have been much more acceptable&quot; from a legal standpoint. Before joining the Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg criticized the decision for venturing &quot;too far in the change it ordered&quot;. Had the decision been limited in scope to only permit abortion during certain circumstances, &quot;physicians might have been less pleased with the decision, but the legislative trend might have continued in the direction in which it was headed&quot;. After becoming a Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg faulted the Court&#x27;s approach for being &quot;about a doctor&#x27;s freedom to practice his profession as he thinks best... It wasn&#x27;t woman-centered. It was physician-centered.&quot; Justice Ginsburg thought that &quot;Roe&quot; was originally intended to complement Medicaid funding for abortions, but this did not happen. About &quot;Harris v. McRae&quot;, which upheld restrictions on Medicaid abortion funding, she said:
Yes, the ruling about that surprised me. Frankly I had thought that at the time &quot;Roe&quot; was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don&#x27;t want to have too many of. So that &quot;Roe&quot; was going to be then set up for Medicaid funding for abortion. Which some people felt would risk coercing women into having abortions when they didn&#x27;t really want them. But when the court decided &quot;McRae&quot;, the case came out the other way. And then I realized that my perception of it had been altogether wrong.

Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox thought the &quot;failure to confront the issue in principled terms leaves the opinion to read like a set of hospital rules and regulations whose validity is good enough this week but will be destroyed with new statistics upon the medical risks of child birth and abortion or new advances in providing for the separate existence of a fetus. Neither historian, nor layman, nor lawyer will be persuaded that all the prescriptions of Justice Blackmun are part of the Constitution.&quot;

In a highly cited &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; article published in the months after the decision, the American legal scholar John Hart Ely criticized &quot;Roe&quot; as a decision that was disconnected from American constitutional law. 
American constitutional law scholar Laurence Tribe said: &quot;One of the most curious things about &quot;Roe&quot; is that, behind its own verbal smokescreen, the substantive judgment on which it rests is nowhere to be found.&quot; Centrist-liberal law professors Alan Dershowitz, Cass Sunstein, and Kermit Roosevelt III have also expressed disappointment with &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

Jeffrey Rosen, as well as Michael Kinsley, echo Ginsburg, arguing that a legislative movement would have been the correct way to build a more durable consensus in support of abortion rights. William Saletan wrote, &quot;Blackmun&#x27;s papers vindicate every indictment of &quot;Roe&quot;: invention, overreach, arbitrariness, textual indifference.&quot; Benjamin Wittes argued that &quot;Roe&quot; &quot;disenfranchised millions of conservatives on an issue about which they care deeply.&quot; Edward Lazarus, a former Blackmun clerk who &quot;loved &quot;Roe&quot;″s author like a grandfather&quot;, wrote: &quot;As a matter of constitutional interpretation and judicial method, &quot;Roe&quot; borders on the indefensible... Justice Blackmun&#x27;s opinion provides essentially no reasoning in support of its holding. And in the almost 30 years since &quot;Roe&quot; announcement, no one has produced a convincing defense of &quot;Roe&quot; on its own terms.&quot;

Richard Epstein thought that the majority opinion relied on a book written by William Lloyd Prosser about tort law when it stated that it &quot;is said&quot; recovery of damages was allowed &quot;only if the fetus was viable, or at least quick, when the injuries were sustained&quot;. He compared this to what was in fact written in the book, which was that &quot;when actually faced with the issue for decision, almost all of the jurisdictions have allowed recovery even though the injury occurred during the early weeks of pregnancy, when the child was neither viable nor quick.&quot;

Matt Bruenig, lawyer and founder of the People&#x27;s Policy Project, criticized &quot;Roe&quot; as being &quot;weaker than normal&quot; and observed that similarly broad interpretations of the Constitution could be used to argue the opposite outcome, saying &quot;right now we have a constitutional right to an abortion—you could also constitutionally ban abortion. If you wanted to, someone could bring a case, file it in a district court, hit the appeal button twice, and then if you get five judges together, the opinion would be the easiest thing in the world to write. You would say, &#x27;the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right to life, liberty, and property without due process and all that shit. So we&#x27;re looking at that, and we think that abortion takes a life and so we think that in fact states may not permit abortion&#x27;. So you could constitutionally ban it and say that no state or federal government is allowed to legalize abortion&quot;.

The assertion that the Supreme Court was making a legislative decision is often repeated by opponents of the ruling. The &quot;viability&quot; criterion was still in effect, although the point of viability changed as medical science found ways to help premature babies survive.

=== Later responses by those involved ===

==== Harry Blackmun ====
Justice Blackmun, who authored the &quot;Roe&quot; decision, subsequently had mixed feelings about his role in the case. During a 1974 television interview, he stated that &quot;Roe&quot; &quot;will be regarded as one of the worst mistakes in the court&#x27;s history or one of its great decisions, a turning point.&quot;

In a 1983 interview for a newspaper journalist, he responded that he was &quot;mildly annoyed at those, law professors included, who personalize it&quot; because &quot;it was a decision of the court, not my decision. There were seven votes.&quot; As a Methodist, he felt hurt that Methodist pastors wrote condemning letters to him, but as time passed, the letters did not hurt &quot;as much anymore&quot;. In defense he responded, &quot;People misunderstand. I am not for abortion. I hope my family never has to face such a decision&quot;, noting that &quot;I still think it was a correct decision&quot; because &quot;we were deciding a constitutional issue, not a moral one.&quot; He described &quot;Roe&quot; as &quot;a no-win case&quot; and predicted that, &quot;fifty years from now, depending on the fate of the proposed constitutional amendment, abortion probably will not be as great a legal issue. I think it will continue to be a moral issue, however.&quot;
He reflected that his role in the decision meant he was most known as the &quot;author of the abortion decision&quot;. His response was that &quot;we all pick up tags. I&#x27;ll carry this one to my grave&quot; and &quot;so be it&quot;.

In 1987, Justice Blackmun explained in a letter to Chief Justice Rehnquist:
I remember that the old Chief appointed a screening committee, chaired by Potter, to select those cases that could (it was assumed) be adequately heard by a Court of seven. I was on that little committee. We did not do a good job. Potter pressed for &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot; to be heard and did so in the misapprehension that they involved nothing more than an application of &quot;Younger v. Harris&quot;. How wrong we were.

In 1991, he regretted how the Court decided to hear &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Doe&quot; in a televised interview: &quot;It was a serious mistake... We did a poor job. I think the committee should have deferred them until we had a full Court.&quot;

In 1992, he stood by the analytical framework he established in &quot;Roe&quot; during the subsequent &quot;Casey&quot; case. He often gave speeches and lectures promoting &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and criticizing &quot;Roe&quot;″s critics.

==== Norma McCorvey ====
A few years after the Supreme Court decided &quot;Roe&quot;, Norma McCorvey made a claim—which she recanted many years later—that she had a nightmare about &quot;little babies lying around with daggers in their hearts&quot;. She said this was the first of recurring nightmares that kept her awake at night. She became worried and wondered, &quot;What really, had I done?&quot; and &quot;Well, how do they kill a baby inside a mother&#x27;s stomach anyway?&quot; McCorvey later claimed:

I couldn&#x27;t get the thought out of my mind. I realize it sounds very naïve, especially for a woman who had already conceived and delivered three children. Though I had seen and experienced more than my share of the world, there were some things about which I still didn&#x27;t have a clue—and this was one of them. Ironically enough, Jane Roe may have known less about abortion than anyone else.

McCorvey joined with and accompanied others in the anti-abortion movement. During this time, McCorvey said that she had publicly lied about being raped and apologized for making the false claim. Norma McCorvey became part of the movement against abortion from 1995 until shortly before her death in 2017. In 1998, she testified to Congress:

In 2002, along with Sandra Cano (Mary Doe) from &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot; and Bernard Nathanson, a co-founder of NARAL Pro-Choice America, McCorvey appeared in a television advertisement intended to persuade the Bush administration to nominate Supreme Court Justices who would oppose abortion.

As a party to the original litigation, she sought to reopen the case in U.S. District Court in Texas to have &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; overturned. However, the Fifth Circuit decided that her case was moot, in &quot;McCorvey v. Hill&quot;. In a concurring opinion, Judge Edith Jones agreed that McCorvey was raising legitimate questions about emotional and other harm suffered by women who have had abortions, about increased resources available for the care of unwanted children, and about new scientific understanding of fetal development. However, Jones said she was compelled to agree that the case was moot. On February 22, 2005, the Supreme Court refused to grant a writ of certiorari, and McCorvey&#x27;s appeal ended.

In an interview shortly before her death, McCorvey stated that she had taken an anti-abortion position because she had been paid to do so and that her campaign against abortion had been an act. She also stated that it did not matter to her if women wanted to have an abortion and they should be free to choose. Rob Schenck, a Methodist pastor and activist who once had anti-abortion views stated that he and others helped entice McCorvey to claim she changed sides and also stated that what they had done with her was &quot;highly unethical&quot; and he had &quot;profound regret&quot; over the matter.

Frank Pavone, a priest with whom McCorvey talked after the interview, reflected after her death that &quot;There was no indication whatsoever, at the end of her life,&quot; that she had given up her pro-life positions. Pavone stated that following the interview, McCorvey talked positively with him about a message she wanted him to convey at the next March for Life. The message concerned encouraging young people to oppose abortion.

==== Sarah Weddington ====
After arguing in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; at the age of 26, Sarah Weddington was elected to the Texas House of Representatives for three terms. Weddington also was general counsel for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, an assistant to President Jimmy Carter, lecturer at the Texas Wesleyan University School of Law, and speaker and adjunct professor at the University of Texas at Austin.

In a 1993 speech for the Institute for Educational Ethics in Oklahoma, Weddington discussed her conduct during &quot;Roe&quot; and stated, &quot;My conduct may not have been totally ethical. But I did it for what I thought were good reasons.&quot;

In 1998, she said that the lack of doctors to abort fetuses could undermine &quot;Roe&quot;: &quot;When I look back on the decision, I thought these words had been written in granite. But I&#x27;ve learned it was not granite. It was more like sandstone. The immediate problem is, where will the doctors come from?&quot; Weddington died on December 26, 2021.

== Subsequent judicial developments ==
&quot;Roe&quot; was embedded in a long line of cases concerning personal liberty in the realm of privacy, since &quot;Roe&quot; was based on individual liberty cases concerning privacy like &quot;Meyer v. Nebraska&quot; (1923), &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965), &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; (1967) and &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot; (1972) and became a foundation for individual liberty cases concerning privacy like &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; (2003) and &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2015).

Two months after the decision in &quot;Roe&quot;, the Court issued a ruling about school funding in &quot;San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez&quot;. The majority opinion cited &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; to assert that privacy itself was a fundamental right, while procreation implicitly counted as &quot;among the rights of personal privacy protected under the Constitution.&quot; In his dissenting opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall stated that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; &quot;reaffirmed its initial decision in &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;&quot;, and noted where &quot;Buck&quot; was cited in &quot;Roe&quot;. He found &quot;Roe&quot; to be a continuation of the Court&#x27;s practice of granting only a limited stature to the right to procreate, since the Court&#x27;s decision treated procreation as less important than the right to privacy. He observed that although past decisions showed strong concern against the state discriminating against certain groups concerning procreation and certain other rights, the &quot;Court has never said or indicated that these are interests which independently enjoy full-blown constitutional protection.&quot; Instead, in &quot;Roe&quot;, &quot;the importance of procreation has indeed been explained on the basis of its intimate relationship with the constitutional right of privacy...&quot; Justice Marshall thought that the method used in &quot;Rodriguez&quot; for determining which rights were more fundamental was wrong, and proposed a different method which would result in procreation receiving greater legal protection.

The legal interaction between &quot;Roe v Wade&quot;, the Fourteenth Amendment as understood post-&quot;Roe&quot;, and changing medical technology and standards caused the development of civil suits for wrongful birth and wrongful life claims. Not all states permit a parent to sue for wrongful birth or a child to sue for wrongful life. The constitutionality of wrongful life claims is controversial within the legal profession, even for states which currently allow them. Pre-&quot;Roe&quot;, a state court dismissed a lawsuit making both a wrongful birth and life claim, which was unsuccessfully appealed to the Supreme Court of New Jersey.

Prior to &quot;Roe&quot;, the Chancery Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey found that a pregnant Jehovah&#x27;s Witness woman could be ordered to submit to lifesaving blood transfusions due to the state&#x27;s compelling interest &quot;to save her life and the life of her unborn child.&quot; The Court appointed a legal guardian to represent the unborn child, and ordered the guardian to consent to blood transfusions and to &quot;seek such other relief as may be necessary to preserve the lives of the mother and the child&quot;. After &quot;Roe&quot;, the Fifth District Appellate Court in Illinois ruled that medical professionals had wrongly transfused blood into a pregnant Jehovah&#x27;s Witness woman on the basis from &quot;Roe&quot; that the &quot;state&#x27;s important and legitimate interest becomes compelling at viability&quot; and her fetus was not yet viable.

President Reagan, who supported legislative restrictions on abortion, began making federal judicial appointments in 1981. Reagan denied that there was any litmus test: &quot;I have never given a litmus test to anyone that I have appointed to the bench... . I feel very strongly about those social issues, but I also place my confidence in the fact that the one thing that I do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law. We&#x27;ve had too many examples in recent years of courts and judges legislating.&quot;

In addition to Justices White and Rehnquist, Reagan-appointee Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor began dissenting from the Court&#x27;s abortion cases, arguing in 1983 that the trimester-based analysis devised by the &quot;Roe&quot; Court was &quot;unworkable.&quot; Shortly before his retirement, Chief Justice Warren Burger suggested in 1986 that &quot;Roe&quot; be &quot;reexamined&quot;; the associate justice who filled Burger&#x27;s place on the Court—Justice Antonin Scalia—vigorously opposed &quot;Roe&quot;. Concern about overturning &quot;Roe&quot; played a major role in the defeat of Robert Bork&#x27;s nomination to the Court in 1987; the man eventually appointed to replace &quot;Roe&quot;-supporter Justice Lewis Powell was Justice Anthony Kennedy.

The justices voting in the majority on the Federal Constitutional Court in pre-unification West Germany rejected the trimester framework in the &quot;German Constitutional Court abortion decision, 1975&quot; on the basis that development during pregnancy is a continuous whole rather than made up of three trimesters. The Court found that the right to life extends also to the unborn and that life begins on the fourteenth day after conception. It also found that the liberties of pregnant mothers were qualified by the existence of another life inside them. The Court found that &quot;A compromise which guarantees the protection of the life of the one about to be born and permits the pregnant woman the freedom of abortion is not possible since the interruption of pregnancy always means the destruction of the unborn life.&quot; It ruled that the fetus must be protected, and the first responsibility for this lies with the mother, with a second responsibility in the hands of the legislature. The Court allowed for a balancing of rights between the mother and unborn child, but required that the rights of each be considered within a framework which acknowledged the supreme, fundamental value of human life. Legislation allowing abortion could be constitutional if the rights of the unborn persons were acknowledged in this manner.

Two minority justices in the ruling for the German Constitutional Court abortion decision in 1975 remarked that &quot;the Supreme Court of the United States has even regarded punishment for the interruption of pregnancy, performed by a physician with the consent of the pregnant woman in the first third of pregnancy, as a violation of fundamental rights. This would, according to German constitutional law, go too far indeed.&quot;

In 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada used the rulings in both &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot; as grounds to find Canada&#x27;s federal law limiting abortions to certified hospitals unconstitutional in &quot;R. v. Morgentaler&quot;.

=== &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Danforth&quot; ===

In &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Danforth&quot;, 428 U.S. 52 (1976), the plaintiffs challenged a Missouri statute which regulated abortion. In the regulations for abortions on demand, the state required prior written consent from a parent if the patient was a minor or a spouse if the patient was married. For pregnancies at 12 weeks and later, the statute also banned saline abortions, in which chemicals are injected into the amniotic sac to burn the fetus. The portions of the statute involving parental or spousal consent and prohibiting saline abortions were struck down.

=== &quot;Floyd v. Anders&quot; ===
In &quot;Floyd v. Anders&quot;, 440 F. Supp. 535 (D.S.C. 1977), South Carolina attempted to prosecute a doctor for illegal abortion and murder after he attempted to abort an African American boy at 25 weeks. During the abortion, the boy was born alive and survived for 20 days before dying. His prosecution was blocked by Judge Clement Haynsworth, and shortly afterwards by a unanimous three judge panel for the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. Judge Haynsworth, writing for the panel, stated &quot;Indeed, the Supreme Court declared the fetus in the womb is neither alive nor a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.&quot; John T. Noonan criticized this from an anti-abortion perspective, stating that &quot;Judge Haynsworth had replaced the Supreme Court&#x27;s test of potential ability to live with a new test of actual ability to live indefinitely. He also had spelled out what was implied in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; but never actually stated there. For the American legal systems the fetus in the womb was not alive.&quot; The standard in &quot;Roe&quot; for viability outside the womb required a &quot;capability of meaningful life&quot;. Without this capability, the state had no compelling &quot;important and legitimate interest in potential life&quot;.

=== &quot;Webster v. Reproductive Health Services&quot; ===
In a 5–4 decision in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Webster v. Reproductive Health Services&quot;, Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, declined to explicitly overrule &quot;Roe&quot;, because &quot;none of the challenged provisions of the Missouri Act properly before us conflict with the Constitution.&quot; In particular, the Court found that the ability to have a nontherapeutic abortion was not an affirmative right of the sort that required the state to pay for it. In this case, the Court upheld several abortion restrictions, and modified the &quot;Roe&quot; trimester framework.

In concurring opinions, Justice O&#x27;Connor refused to reconsider &quot;Roe&quot;, and Justice Antonin Scalia criticized the Court and Justice O&#x27;Connor for not overruling &quot;Roe&quot;. Justice Blackmun stated in his dissent that Justices White, Kennedy and Rehnquist were &quot;callous&quot; and &quot;deceptive&quot;, that they deserved to be charged with &quot;cowardice and illegitimacy&quot;, and that their plurality opinion &quot;foments disregard for the law.&quot; White had recently opined that the majority reasoning in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was &quot;warped.&quot;

=== &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; ===

During initial deliberations for &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; (1992), an initial majority of five justices (Rehnquist, White, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas) were willing to effectively overturn &quot;Roe&quot;. Justice Kennedy changed his mind after the initial conference, and Justices O&#x27;Connor, Kennedy, and Souter joined Justices Blackmun and Stevens to reaffirm the central holding of &quot;Roe&quot;, but instead of justifying the liberty to abort as being based on privacy as in &quot;Roe&quot;, it justified the liberty in a broader manner. The opinion asserted an individual&#x27;s liberty to choose concerning family life and also protection from legal enforcement intended to maintain traditional sex roles, writing, &quot;Our law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education...&quot; and against the state insisting &quot;upon its own vision of the woman&#x27;s role, however dominant that vision has been in the course of our history and our culture. The destiny of the woman must be shaped to a large extent on her own conception of her spiritual imperatives and her place in society.&quot;

The plurality of justices stated that abortion-related legislation should be reviewed based on the undue burden standard instead of the strict scrutiny standard from &quot;Roe&quot;.

The plurality also found that a fetus was now viable at 23 or 24 weeks rather than at the 28-week line from 1973. They also felt that fetal viability was &quot;more workable&quot; than the trimester framework. They abandoned the trimester framework due to two basic flaws: &quot;in its formulation it misconceives the nature of the pregnant woman&#x27;s interest; and in practice it undervalues the State&#x27;s interest in potential life, as recognized in &quot;Roe&quot;.&quot; Only Justice Blackmun wanted to retain &quot;Roe&quot; entirely and issue a decision completely in favor of Planned Parenthood. Prior to this, he had considered a Pennsylvania viability-based law to be unconstitutionally vague in his majority opinion for &quot;Colautti v. Franklin&quot;.

Justice Scalia&#x27;s dissent asserted that abortion is not a liberty protected by the Constitution for the same reason bigamy was not protected either: because the Constitution does not mention it, and because longstanding traditions have permitted it to be legally proscribed. He also asked:

Precisely why is it that, at the magical second when machines currently in use (though not necessarily available to the particular woman) are able to keep an unborn child alive apart from its mother, the creature is suddenly able (under our Constitution) to be protected by law, whereas before that magical second it was not? That makes no more sense than according infants legal protection only after the point when they can feed themselves.

=== &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot; ===

During the 1990s, Nebraska enacted a law banning partial-birth abortion. The law allowed another second-trimester abortion procedure known as dilation and evacuation. In 2000, the Supreme Court struck down the law by a 5–4 vote in &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot;, with Justice Stephen Breyer writing for the majority that sometimes partial-birth abortion &quot;would be the safest procedure&quot;. Justice O&#x27;Connor wrote a concurrence stating Nebraska was actually banning both abortion methods. Justices Ginsburg and Stevens joined each other&#x27;s concurrences. Justice Stevens stated that &quot;the notion that either of these two equally gruesome procedures performed at this late stage of gestation is more akin to infanticide than the other... is simply irrational.&quot; Justice Ginsburg stated that the &quot;law does not save any fetus from destruction, for it targets only &#x27;a method of performing abortion&#x27;.&quot;

Justice Thomas&#x27;s dissent stated, &quot;The &#x27;partial birth&#x27; gives the fetus an autonomy which separates it from the right of the woman to choose treatments for her own body.&quot; Justice Scalia joined Justice Thomas&#x27;s dissent and also wrote his own, stating that partial-birth abortion is &quot;so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion&quot; and that this case proved &quot;Casey&quot; was &quot;unworkable&quot;. Chief Justice Rehnquist joined the two dissents by Justices Scalia and Thomas.

Justice Kennedy, who had co-authored &quot;Casey&quot;, dissented in &quot;Stenberg&quot;. He described in graphic detail exactly how a fetus dies while being dismembered during a dilation and evacuation procedure. He reasoned that since Nebraska was not seeking to prohibit it, the state was free to ban partial-birth abortion.

=== &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot; ===
In 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which led to a lawsuit in the case of &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;. The Court previously ruled in &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot; that a state&#x27;s ban on partial-birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception for the health of the woman. The membership of the Court changed after &quot;Stenberg&quot;, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito replacing Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice O&#x27;Connor. The ban at issue in &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot; was similar to the one in &quot;Stenberg&quot;, but had been adjusted to comply with the Court&#x27;s ruling.

On April 18, 2007, a 5 to 4 decision upheld the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion that Congress was within its power to ban partial-birth abortion. The Court left the door open for as-applied challenges. The opinion did not address whether &quot;Casey&quot; remained valid. Instead it only assumed &quot;Casey&quot; was valid &quot;for the purposes of this opinion&quot;.

Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito joined the majority. Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Scalia, contending that the Court&#x27;s prior decisions in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; should be reversed. They also noted that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may have exceeded the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause but that the question was not raised.

Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer, dissented, contending that the ruling ignored precedent and that abortion rights should instead be justified by equality.

=== &quot;Dubay v. Wells&quot; ===
&quot;Dubay v. Wells&quot; was a 2006 paternity case where a man argued he should not have to pay child support for a child he did not want to parent. The case was billed as &quot;&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; for men&quot;.

On March 9, 2006, Dubay filed a lawsuit before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Michigan&#x27;s Attorney General, Joel D. McGormley, made a motion to have the case dismissed. On July 17, 2006, District Court Judge David Lawson agreed and dismissed Dubay&#x27;s lawsuit. He appealed it once, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which also dismissed it, and stated:
Dubay&#x27;s claim that a man&#x27;s right to disclaim fatherhood would be analogous to a woman&#x27;s right to abortion rests upon a false analogy. In the case of a father seeking to opt out of fatherhood and thereby avoid child support obligations, the child is already in existence and the state therefore has an important interest in providing for his or her support.

=== &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot; ===
In 2013, the Texas legislature enacted restrictions which required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and required abortion clinics to have facilities equivalent to others which conducted outpatient surgery. On June 27, 2016, the Supreme Court in a 5–3 decision for &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot; struck down these restrictions.

The majority opinion by Justice Breyer struck down these two provisions of Texas law in a facial manner—that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation. The ruling also stated that the task of judging whether a law puts an undue burden on a woman&#x27;s right to abortion belongs with the courts and not the legislatures.

=== &quot;Box v. Planned Parenthood&quot; ===
In 2016, Indiana passed House Bill 1337, enacting a law which regulated what is done with fetal remains and banning abortion for sexist, racist, or ableist purposes. In its unsigned 2019 ruling for &quot;Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the regulations about fetal remains, but declined to hear the remainder of the law, which had been blocked by lower courts. Justice Ginsburg dissented from the part of the ruling about fetal remains on the basis that the regulations violated &quot;Casey&quot;. She also criticized Justice Thomas over his use of the word &quot;mother&quot; in his concurrence.

Justice Sotomayor stated that she wished the Court would not have heard the case at all. Justice Thomas wrote a concurring opinion which expressed concern that the theory presented in &quot;Freakonomics&quot; echoed the views of the eugenics movement. He warned that &quot;a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the 20th-century eugenics movement&quot;. He predicted, &quot;Although the Court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever.&quot;

===&quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Jackson&quot;===
In 2021, the state of Texas devised a legal workaround to &quot;Roe&quot; that allowed it to successfully outlaw abortion at six weeks of pregnancy despite the continued existence of &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot;. In the Texas Heartbeat Act, the legislature created a novel enforcement mechanism that bars state officials from enforcing the statute and authorizes private individuals to sue anyone who performs or assists an illegal abortion. Because the Act is enforced by private citizens rather than government officials, there are no state officials that abortion providers can sue to stop the enforcement of the law, and they cannot obtain judicial relief that will stop private lawsuits from being initiated against them. This has produced an end-run around &quot;Roe&quot; because the threat of private civil-enforcement lawsuits has forced abortion providers to comply with the Act despite its incompatibility with the Supreme Court&#x27;s abortion pronouncements. Other states have copied this enforcement mechanism to sidestep &quot;Roe&quot; and immunize their anti-abortion statutes from judicial review. This maneuver has weakened &quot;Roe&quot; and undercut the federal judiciary&#x27;s ability to protect abortion rights from state legislation.

=== &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; ===
&quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; is a case that was a legal challenge to Mississippi&#x27;s 2018 Gestational Age Act, which had banned abortions after 15 weeks with exceptions only for medical emergencies or fetal abnormalities. Federal courts had enjoined the state from enforcing the law after the state&#x27;s only abortion clinic, Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization, filed suit immediately after passage; the federal courts stated that the law violated the previously established 24-week point of viability. Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to hear the case on June 15, 2020, and the Court certified the petition on May 17, 2021, limited to the question, &quot;Whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.&quot; The Court chose not to take up two other questions that Mississippi wanted to bring before the Court.

On May 2, 2022, &quot;Politico&quot; released a leaked first draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, which had been circulated among the court in February 2022. Alito&#x27;s draft wrote, &quot;We hold that &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot; must be overruled. It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people&#x27;s elected representatives.&quot; The release of a draft opinion for a pending case was unprecedented in recent Supreme Court history. The document was not a final decision, and the justices were still able to change their votes. The document was thought to reflect both the justices&#x27; preliminary voting and the outcome of the internal Court procedure for deciding who is assigned to write the majority opinion. A press release from the Supreme Court confirmed the leaked document&#x27;s authenticity, and Chief Justice John Roberts in a statement described its release as a &quot;betrayal of the confidences of the Court&quot;. The leaked draft regarding the decision sparked protests.

On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 to uphold Mississippi&#x27;s Gestational Age Act, and 5–4 to overrule &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot;. Similar to the leaked draft opinion, the opinion of the court written by Justice Alito stated that &quot;Roe&quot; was &quot;egregiously wrong from the start&quot; and its reasoning &quot;exceptionally weak&quot;. It also stated that &quot;Roe&quot; has &quot;enflamed debate and deepened division&quot; and that overruling it would &quot;return the issue of abortion to the people&#x27;s elected representatives&quot;. The majority opinion relied on a constitutional historical view of abortion rights, saying, &quot;The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.&quot; The reasoning was that &quot;abortion couldn&#x27;t be constitutionally protected. Until the latter part of the 20th century, such a right was entirely unknown in American law. Indeed, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three quarters of the States made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy.&quot; Some historians argued that this view is incomplete, with Leslie J. Reagan saying that Alito &quot;speciously claims&quot; the truth of his assertions. In their dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor jointly wrote, &quot;The right &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot; recognized does not stand alone. To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception. In turn, those rights led, more recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage. Either the mass of the majority&#x27;s opinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under threat. It is one or the other.&quot;

== Role in politics ==
=== Presidential positions ===
Generally, presidential opinions following &quot;Roe&quot; have been split along major party lines. The decision was opposed by presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump. President George H. W. Bush also opposed &quot;Roe&quot;, though he had supported abortion rights earlier in his career.

President Richard Nixon appointed Justices Burger, Blackmun, and Powell who voted with the majority, and Justice Rehnquist who dissented. President Nixon did not publicly comment about &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

During his early career, President Jimmy Carter supported legalizing abortion in order to save the life of a woman or in the event of birth defects, or in other extreme circumstances. As president, he thought abortion was wrong, but stated that he &quot;accepted my obligation to enforce the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; Supreme Court ruling, and at the same time attempted in every way possible to minimize the number of abortions.&quot; In 2012 he reflected, &quot;I never have believed that Jesus Christ would approve of abortions and that was one of the problems I had when I was president having to uphold &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;...&quot; He urged the Democratic Party to take a position supporting pregnant mothers to minimize economic and social factors driving women to get abortions. He also wanted the party to take stand in favor of banning abortion except for those whose lives &quot;are in danger or who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest.&quot;

&quot;Roe&quot; was supported by presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. In 1981, then-Senator Joe Biden voted for a constitutional amendment allowing states to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which he voted against the following year. In a 2007 memoir, Biden expressed an opinion that although he was &quot;personally opposed to abortion&quot; he did not have the &quot;right to impose&quot; his personal opposition onto others. In 2021, he described himself to reporters as &quot;a strong supporter of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;&quot;, and added, &quot;And I under— I respect people who think that—who don&#x27;t support &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;; I respect their views. I respect them—they—those who believe life begins at the moment of conception and all. I respect that. Don&#x27;t agree, but I respect that. I&#x27;m not going to impose that on people.&quot;

=== Federal bills or laws regarding &quot;Roe&quot; ===
Federal bills, amendments, or laws regarding &quot;Roe&quot; include the Women&#x27;s Health Protection Act, Freedom of Choice Act, Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, Unborn Victims of Violence Act, Interstate Abortion Bill, No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995, Sanctity of Human Life Act, Sanctity of Life Act, Hyde Amendment, Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, and the Baby Doe Law.

Following the passage of the Texas Heartbeat Act and the Supreme Court&#x27;s acceptance of the &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; case, and the threat the case poses to &quot;Roe&quot; in the eyes of &quot;Roe&quot; supporters, Neal Kumar Katyal, a law professor and former acting solicitor general of the United States, said that instead of abortion regulation by the judicial branch, Congress could &quot;codify the rights two generations have taken as part of American life&quot;, and &quot;nullify the threat to reproductive health posed by the Mississippi case.&quot; Thomas Jipping of the Heritage Foundation wrote that the Women&#x27;s Health Protection Act is unconstitutional because it regulates how state legislatures regulate abortion and abortion services rather than directly regulating abortion at the federal level. Views that the WHPA is unconstitutional or should otherwise be opposed were expressed during Senate Judiciary Committee hearings in 2014.

=== State laws regarding &quot;Roe&quot; ===
At the state level, there have been many laws about abortion. In the decade after &quot;Roe&quot;, most states passed laws protecting medical workers with a conscientious objection to abortion. Nine states which had legalized abortion or loosened abortion restrictions prior to &quot;Roe&quot; already had statutory protection for those who did not want to participate in or perform an abortion. As of 2011, forty-seven states and the District of Columbia had laws allowing certain people to decline to perform certain actions or provide information related to abortion or reproductive health. At the federal level, the Church Amendment of 1973 was proposed to protect private hospitals objecting to abortion from being deprived of funding. It first passed the Senate, 92–1, then a slightly modified version passed the House, 372–1, and the final bill which contained it passed the Senate 94–0. Justice Blackmun supported this and other regulations protecting individual physicians and entire hospitals operated by religious denominations.

Some states have passed laws to maintain the legality of abortion if &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; is overturned. Those states include California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, and Washington. Other states have enacted so-called trigger laws that would take effect in the event that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; is overturned, with the effect of outlawing abortions on the state level. Those states include Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Additionally, many states did not repeal pre-1973 statutes against abortion, and some of those statutes could again be in force if &quot;Roe&quot; were reversed.

On April 16, 2012, Mississippi House Bill 1390 was signed into law. The law attempted to make abortion unfeasible without having to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Judge Daniel Porter Jordan III of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi granted an injunction against the law on July 13, 2012. On April 15, 2013, he issued another injunction which only applied to a part of the law which required the individual performing the abortions to have hospital admitting privileges. On July 29, 2014, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the injunction against part of the law, with Judge Emilio M. Garza dissenting. The ruling especially relied on a case unrelated to &quot;Roe&quot; which was decided &quot;nearly fifty years before the right to an abortion was found in the penumbras of the Constitution&quot;. On February 18, 2015, Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, but they declined to hear it on June 28, 2016.

The Human Life Protection Act was signed by Alabama governor Kay Ivey on May 14, 2019, in hopes of challenging &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in the Supreme Court. It includes exceptions for a serious health risk to the mother or a lethal fetal anomaly, but otherwise it will make abortion a felony for the abortion doctor if it goes into effect. Women subjected to an abortion will not be criminally culpable or civilly liable under the law. On October 29, 2019, Judge Myron Thompson for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama issued a preliminary injunction against the law.

In May 2021, Texas lawmakers passed Senate Bill 8, creating the Texas Heartbeat Act, banning abortions except in cases of medical emergency as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected. This is typically as early as six weeks into pregnancy and often before women know they are pregnant. The law established that any Texas resident who is not a state or local government employee or official can sue abortion clinics and doctors who are known to be &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; abortion procedures after six weeks. A clause forbids anyone who impregnated an abortion patient through rape, sexual assault, or incest to sue concerning the patient. The enactment date was September 1, 2021, and the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, declined a request to block enforcement of the law that day. On October 22, 2021, the Court again did not block the law&#x27;s enforcement, and agreed to hear arguments for &quot;United States v. Texas&quot; on November 1, 2021. They limited the question to a review of standing. On December 10, 2021, the Court dismissed the lawsuit on the basis that lower courts should not have accepted it. This decision allows lawsuits against the executive directors of Texas&#x27;s medical, nursing, and pharmacy licensing boards and also against the executive commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, but not certain other lawsuits seeking to overturn the law.

== Legacy ==
=== Effects of legalization ===

&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; caused a 4.5% decline in births in states that had not previously legalized abortion. Although the legalization of abortion in the United States increased the labor supply of fertile-aged women in the workforce, it decreased the labor supply of older women. This is thought to be due to the fact they now had fewer opportunities to financially support grandchildren. Older women whose labors became less necessary for the family&#x27;s financial wellbeing either left or stayed out of the workforce. Since &quot;Roe&quot;, the risk of death due to legal abortion fell considerably due to increased physician skills, improved medical technology, and earlier termination of pregnancy. Various studies have shown that overturning &quot;Roe&quot; could have adverse socio-economic conditions, higher maternal mortality, and other negative impacts.

The Donohue–Levitt hypothesis about the legalized abortion and crime effect proposed that legalized abortion was responsible for reductions in the crime rate. If there is a relationship between abortion and crime, there are several possibilities that could explain how abortion lowers crime. One possibility is that crime is disproportionally committed by young males, and legalizing abortion reduced the number of young males. Another possibility is that children born in the post-legalization era are less likely to commit crimes. If this is the case, it might be explained in two ways. One way is that the sort of women who have abortions are not representative of pregnant women as a whole; rather they are the sort who are most likely to give birth to children who grow up to be criminals. In this way, abortion serves to shape American family structure. Studies linking demographics to crime have found that children born to American teenagers, unmarried mothers, and mothers with lower incomes are more likely to engage in criminal activity as adolescents. Abortion rates are higher for these demographics. A second possible way to explain it is that women use abortion to prevent births until they are most able to provide a stable home environment. Factors involved in stability include the age, education, income, of the mother, her use of drugs and alcohol, the presence of a father, and wanted as opposed to unwanted pregnancies. Another hypothesis is the Roe effect, which tries to explain why the practice of abortion would eventually lead to abortion being restricted or outlawed. The hypothesis is that people in favor of abortion rights would not parent as many children when abortion is legal, and since children tend to have similar views to their parents eventually voters would not support abortion rights. Critics have argued that Donohue and Levitt&#x27;s methodologies are flawed and that no statistically significant relationship between abortion and later crime rates can be proven.

=== Opinion polls ===

Into the 21st century, polls of Americans&#x27; opinions about abortion indicated they are about equally divided. Several organizations, among them Gallup, Pew Research Center, and Harris Insights &amp; Analytics, conduct abortion or &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;-related polls. Regarding the &quot;Roe&quot; decision as a whole, more Americans supported it than supported overturning it. In the 2000s, when pollsters describe various regulations that &quot;Roe&quot; prevented legislatures from enacting, support for &quot;Roe&quot; dropped.

Into the 2010s, poll results relating to abortion indicated nuance and frequently do not directly match up with respondents&#x27; self-identified political affiliations. In 2021, an ABC News/&quot;Washington Post&quot; poll found that 58% of those with children living at home wanted to see &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; upheld, compared to 62% of those without children at home. An All in Together poll found that only 36% with children living in their house opposed the Texas Heartbeat Act, compared to 54.9% without children. After the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in June 2022 to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, a new CBC News/YouGov poll showed 59% disapprove of the decision, and of women polled, 67% disapprove. According to the same poll, 52% of the participants called the court&#x27;s decision a &quot;step backward&quot; for America, 31% said it is a &quot;step forward&quot;, and 17% say it was neither. A January 2023 Gallup poll found that nearly 7 in 10 Americans disapprove of the country&#x27;s abortion policies, the highest rate in 23 years.

<text>Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is a renewable energy technology that harnesses the temperature difference between the warm surface waters of the ocean and the cold depths to run a heat engine to produce electricity. It is a unique form of clean energy generation that has the potential to provide a consistent and sustainable source of power. Although it has challenges to overcome, OTEC has the potential to provide a consistent and sustainable source of clean energy, particularly in tropical regions with access to deep ocean water.

== Description ==
OTEC uses the ocean thermal gradient between cooler deep and warmer shallow or surface seawaters to run a heat engine and produce useful work, usually in the form of electricity. OTEC can operate with a very high capacity factor and so can operate in base load mode.

The denser cold water masses, formed by ocean surface water interaction with cold atmosphere in quite specific areas of the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean, sink into the deep sea basins and spread in entire deep ocean by the thermohaline circulation. Upwelling of cold water from the deep ocean is replenished by the downwelling of cold surface sea water.

Among ocean energy sources, OTEC is one of the continuously available renewable energy resources that could contribute to base-load power supply. The resource potential for OTEC is considered to be much larger than for other ocean energy forms. Up to 10,000 TWh/yr of power could be generated from OTEC without affecting the ocean&#x27;s thermal structure.

Systems may be either closed-cycle or open-cycle. Closed-cycle OTEC uses working fluids that are typically thought of as refrigerants such as ammonia or R-134a. These fluids have low boiling points, and are therefore suitable for powering the system&#x27;s generator to generate electricity. The most commonly used heat cycle for OTEC to date is the Rankine cycle, using a low-pressure turbine. Open-cycle engines use vapor from the seawater itself as the working fluid.

OTEC can also supply quantities of cold water as a by-product. This can be used for air conditioning and refrigeration and the nutrient-rich deep ocean water can feed biological technologies. Another by-product is fresh water distilled from the sea.

OTEC theory was first developed in the 1880s and the first bench size demonstration model was constructed in 1926. Currently operating pilot-scale OTEC plants are located in Japan, overseen by Saga University, and Makai in Hawaii.

== History ==

Attempts to develop and refine OTEC technology started in the 1880s. In 1881, Jacques Arsene d&#x27;Arsonval, a French physicist, proposed tapping the thermal energy of the ocean. D&#x27;Arsonval&#x27;s student, Georges Claude, built the first OTEC plant, in Matanzas, Cuba in 1930. The system generated 22 kW of electricity with a low-pressure turbine. The plant was later destroyed in a storm.

In 1935, Claude constructed a plant aboard a 10,000-ton cargo vessel moored off the coast of Brazil. Weather and waves destroyed it before it could generate net power. (Net power is the amount of power generated after subtracting power needed to run the system).

In 1956, French scientists designed a 3 MW plant for Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The plant was never completed, because new finds of large amounts of cheap petroleum made it uneconomical.

In 1962, J. Hilbert Anderson and James H. Anderson, Jr. focused on increasing component efficiency. They patented their new &quot;closed cycle&quot; design in 1967. This design improved upon the original closed-cycle Rankine system, and included this in an outline for a plant that would produce power at lower cost than oil or coal. At the time, however, their research garnered little attention since coal and nuclear were considered the future of energy.

Japan is a major contributor to the development of OTEC technology. Beginning in 1970 the Tokyo Electric Power Company successfully built and deployed a 100 kW closed-cycle OTEC plant on the island of Nauru. The plant became operational on 14 October 1981, producing about 120 kW of electricity; 90 kW was used to power the plant and the remaining electricity was used to power a school and other places. This set a world record for power output from an OTEC system where the power was sent to a real (as opposed to an experimental) power grid.

1981 also saw a major development in OTEC technology when Russian engineer, Dr. Alexander Kalina, used a mixture of ammonia and water to produce electricity. This new ammonia-water mixture greatly improved the efficiency of the power cycle. In 1994, the Institute of Ocean Energy at Saga University designed and constructed a 4.5 kW plant for the purpose of testing a newly invented Uehara cycle, also named after its inventor Haruo Uehara. This cycle included absorption and extraction processes that allow this system to outperform the Kalina cycle by 1–2%.

The 1970s saw an uptick in OTEC research and development during the post 1973 Arab-Israeli War, which caused oil prices to triple. The U.S. federal government poured $260 million into OTEC research after President Carter signed a law that committed the US to a production goal of 10,000 MW of electricity from OTEC systems by 1999.

In 1974, The U.S. established the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA) at Keahole Point on the Kona coast of Hawaii. Hawaii is the best US OTEC location, due to its warm surface water, access to very deep, very cold water, and high electricity costs. The laboratory has become a leading test facility for OTEC technology. In the same year, Lockheed received a grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation to study OTEC. This eventually led to an effort by Lockheed, the US Navy, Makai Ocean Engineering, Dillingham Construction, and other firms to build the world&#x27;s first and only net-power producing OTEC plant, dubbed &quot;Mini-OTEC&quot; For three months in 1979, a small amount of electricity was generated. NELHA operated a 250 kW demonstration plant for six years in the 1990s. With funding from the United States Navy, a 105 kW plant at the site began supplying energy to the local power grid in 2015.

A European initiative EUROCEAN - a privately funded joint venture of 9 European companies already active in offshore engineering - was active in promoting OTEC from 1979 to 1983. Initially a large scale offshore facility was studied. Later a 100 kW land based installation was studied combining land based OTEC with Desalination and Aquaculture nicknamed ODA. This was based on the results from a small scale aquaculture facility at the island of St Croix that used a deepwater supply line to feed the aquaculture basins. Also a shore based open cycle plant was investigated.
The location of the case of study was the Dutch Kingdom related island Curaçao.

Research related to making open-cycle OTEC a reality began earnestly in 1979 at the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) with funding from the US Department of Energy. Evaporators and suitably configured direct-contact condensers were developed and patented by SERI (see). An original design for a power-producing experiment, then called the 165-kW experiment was described by Kreith and Bharathan and as the Max Jakob Memorial Award Lecture. The initial design used two parallel axial turbines, using last stage rotors taken from large steam turbines. Later, a team led by Dr. Bharathan at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed the initial conceptual design for up-dated 210 kW open-cycle OTEC experiment (). This design integrated all components of the cycle, namely, the evaporator, condenser and the turbine into one single vacuum vessel, with the turbine mounted on top to prevent any potential for water to reach it. The vessel was made of concrete as the first process vacuum vessel of its kind. Attempts to make all components using low-cost plastic material could not be fully achieved, as some conservatism was required for the turbine and the vacuum pumps developed as the first of their kind. Later Dr. Bharathan worked with a team of engineers at the Pacific Institute for High Technology Research (PICHTR) to further pursue this design through preliminary and final stages. It was renamed the Net Power Producing Experiment (NPPE) and was constructed at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii (NELH) by PICHTR by a team led by Chief Engineer Don Evans and the project was managed by Dr. Luis Vega.

In 2002, India tested a 1 MW floating OTEC pilot plant near Tamil Nadu. The plant was ultimately unsuccessful due to a failure of the deep sea cold water pipe. Its government continues to sponsor research.

In 2006, Makai Ocean Engineering was awarded a contract from the U.S. Office of Naval Research (ONR) to investigate the potential for OTEC to produce nationally significant quantities of hydrogen in at-sea floating plants located in warm, tropical waters. Realizing the need for larger partners to actually commercialize OTEC, Makai approached Lockheed Martin to renew their previous relationship and determine if the time was ready for OTEC. And so in 2007, Lockheed Martin resumed work in OTEC and became a subcontractor to Makai to support their SBIR, which was followed by other subsequent collaborations

In March 2011, Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation signed an Energy Services Agreement (ESA) with the Baha Mar resort, Nassau, Bahamas, for the world&#x27;s first and largest seawater air conditioning (SWAC) system. In June 2015, the project was put on pause while the resort resolved financial and ownership issues. In August 2016, it was announced that the issues had been resolved and that the resort would open in March 2017. It is expected that the SWAC system&#x27;s construction will resume at that time.

In July 2011, Makai Ocean Engineering completed the design and construction of an OTEC Heat Exchanger Test Facility at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii. The purpose of the facility is to arrive at an optimal design for OTEC heat exchangers, increasing performance and useful life while reducing cost (heat exchangers being the #1 cost driver for an OTEC plant). And in March 2013, Makai announced an award to install and operate a 100 kilowatt turbine on the OTEC Heat Exchanger Test Facility, and once again connect OTEC power to the grid.

In July 2016, the Virgin Islands Public Services Commission approved Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation&#x27;s application to become a Qualified Facility. The company is thus permitted to begin negotiations with the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority (WAPA) for a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) pertaining to an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plant on the island of St. Croix. This would be the world&#x27;s first commercial OTEC plant.

A project is set to be installed in the African country of São Tomé and Príncipe, which will be the first commercial-scale floating OTEC platform in the world. Developed by Global OTEC, the structure named Dominique will generate 1.5MW, with subsequent barges being installed to help supply the full demand of the country. In 2022, an MoU was signed between the government and British startup Global OTEC.

== Currently operating OTEC plants ==

In March 2013, Saga University with various Japanese industries completed the installation of a new OTEC plant. Okinawa Prefecture announced the start of the OTEC operation testing at Kume Island on April 15, 2013. The main aim is to prove the validity of computer models and demonstrate OTEC to the public. The testing and research will be conducted with the support of Saga University until the end of FY 2016. IHI Plant Construction Co. Ltd, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, and Xenesys Inc were entrusted with constructing the 100 kilowatt class plant within the grounds of the Okinawa Prefecture Deep Sea Water Research Center. The location was specifically chosen in order to utilize existing deep seawater and surface seawater intake pipes installed for the research center in 2000. The pipe is used for the intake of deep sea water for research, fishery, and agricultural use.
The plant consists of two 50 kW units in double Rankine configuration. The OTEC facility and deep seawater research center are open to free public tours by appointment in English and Japanese. Currently, this is one of only two fully operational OTEC plants in the world. This plant operates continuously when specific tests are not underway.

In 2011, Makai Ocean Engineering completed a heat exchanger test facility at NELHA. Used to test a variety of heat exchange technologies for use in OTEC, Makai has received funding to install a 105 kW turbine. Installation will make this facility the largest operational OTEC facility, though the record for largest power will remain with the Open Cycle plant also developed in Hawaii.

In July 2014, DCNS group partnered with Akuo Energy announced NER 300 funding for their NEMO project. If the project was successful, the 16 MW gross 10 MW net offshore plant would have been the largest OTEC facility to date. DCNS planned to have NEMO operational by 2020. Early in April 2018, Naval Energies shut down the project indefinitely due to technical difficulties relating to the main cold-water intake pipe.

An ocean thermal energy conversion power plant built by Makai Ocean Engineering went operational in Hawaii in August 2015. The governor of Hawaii, David Ige, &quot;flipped the switch&quot; to activate the plant. This is the first true closed-cycle ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plant to be connected to a U.S. electrical grid. It is a demo plant capable of generating 105 kilowatts, enough to power about 120 homes.

== Thermodynamic efficiency ==

A heat engine gives greater efficiency when run with a large temperature difference. In the oceans the temperature difference between surface and deep water is greatest in the tropics, although still a modest 20 to 25 °C. It is therefore in the tropics that OTEC offers the greatest possibilities. OTEC has the potential to offer global amounts of energy that are 10 to 100 times greater than other ocean energy options such as wave power.

OTEC plants can operate continuously providing a base load supply for an electrical power generation system.

The main technical challenge of OTEC is to generate significant amounts of power efficiently from small temperature differences. It is still considered an emerging technology. Early OTEC systems were 1 to 3 percent thermally efficient, well below the theoretical maximum 6 and 7 percent for this temperature difference. Modern designs allow performance approaching the theoretical maximum Carnot efficiency.

== Power cycle types ==

Cold seawater is an integral part of each of the three types of OTEC systems: closed-cycle, open-cycle, and hybrid. To operate, the cold seawater must be brought to the surface. The primary approaches are active pumping and desalination. Desalinating seawater near the sea floor lowers its density, which causes it to rise to the surface.

The alternative to costly pipes to bring condensing cold water to the surface is to pump vaporized low boiling point fluid into the depths to be condensed, thus reducing pumping volumes and reducing technical and environmental problems and lowering costs.

=== Closed ===
Closed-cycle systems use fluid with a low boiling point, such as ammonia (having a boiling point around -33 °C at atmospheric pressure), to power a turbine to generate electricity. Warm surface seawater is pumped through a heat exchanger to vaporize the fluid. The expanding vapor turns the turbo-generator. Cold water, pumped through a second heat exchanger, condenses the vapor into a liquid, which is then recycled through the system.

In 1979, the Natural Energy Laboratory and several private-sector partners developed the &quot;mini OTEC&quot; experiment, which achieved the first successful at-sea production of net electrical power from closed-cycle OTEC. The mini OTEC vessel was moored off the Hawaiian coast and produced enough net electricity to illuminate the ship&#x27;s light bulbs and run its computers and television.

=== Open ===
Open-cycle OTEC uses warm surface water directly to make electricity. The warm seawater is first pumped into a low-pressure container, which causes it to boil. In some schemes, the expanding vapor drives a low-pressure turbine attached to an electrical generator. The vapor, which has left its salt and other contaminants in the low-pressure container, is pure fresh water. It is condensed into a liquid by exposure to cold temperatures from deep-ocean water. This method produces desalinized fresh water, suitable for drinking water, irrigation or aquaculture.

In other schemes, the rising vapor is used in a gas lift technique of lifting water to significant heights. Depending on the embodiment, such vapor lift pump techniques generate power from a hydroelectric turbine either before or after the pump is used.

In 1984, the &quot;Solar Energy Research Institute&quot; (now known as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) developed a vertical-spout evaporator to convert warm seawater into low-pressure steam for open-cycle plants. Conversion efficiencies were as high as 97% for seawater-to-steam conversion (overall steam production would only be a few percent of the incoming water). In May 1993, an open-cycle OTEC plant at Keahole Point, Hawaii, produced close to 80 kW of electricity during a net power-producing experiment. This broke the record of 40 kW set by a Japanese system in 1982.

=== Hybrid ===

A hybrid cycle combines the features of the closed- and open-cycle systems. In a hybrid, warm seawater enters a vacuum chamber and is flash-evaporated, similar to the open-cycle evaporation process. The steam vaporizes the ammonia working fluid of a closed-cycle loop on the other side of an ammonia vaporizer. The vaporized fluid then drives a turbine to produce electricity. The steam condenses within the heat exchanger and provides desalinated water (see heat pipe).

=== Working fluids ===
A popular choice of working fluid is ammonia, which has superior transport properties, easy availability, and low cost. Ammonia, however, is toxic and flammable. Fluorinated carbons such as CFCs and HCFCs are not toxic or flammable, but they contribute to ozone layer depletion. Hydrocarbons too are good candidates, but they are highly flammable; in addition, this would create competition for use of them directly as fuels. The power plant size is dependent upon the vapor pressure of the working fluid. With increasing vapor pressure, the size of the turbine and heat exchangers decreases while the wall thickness of the pipe and heat exchangers increase to endure high pressure especially on the evaporator side.

== Land, shelf and floating sites ==
OTEC has the potential to produce gigawatts of electrical power, and in conjunction with electrolysis, could produce enough hydrogen to completely replace all projected global fossil fuel consumption. Reducing costs remains an unsolved challenge, however. OTEC plants require a long, large diameter intake pipe, which is submerged a kilometer or more into the ocean&#x27;s depths, to bring cold water to the surface.

=== Land-based ===

Land-based and near-shore facilities offer three main advantages over those located in deep water. Plants constructed on or near land do not require sophisticated mooring, lengthy power cables, or the more extensive maintenance associated with open-ocean environments. They can be installed in sheltered areas so that they are relatively safe from storms and heavy seas. Electricity, desalinated water, and cold, nutrient-rich seawater could be transmitted from near-shore facilities via trestle bridges or causeways. In addition, land-based or near-shore sites allow plants to operate with related industries such as mariculture or those that require desalinated water.

Favored locations include those with narrow shelves (volcanic islands), steep (15–20 degrees) offshore slopes, and relatively smooth sea floors. These sites minimize the length of the intake pipe. A land-based plant could be built well inland from the shore, offering more protection from storms, or on the beach, where the pipes would be shorter. In either case, easy access for construction and operation helps lower costs.

Land-based or near-shore sites can also support mariculture or chilled water agriculture. Tanks or lagoons built on shore allow workers to monitor and control miniature marine environments. Mariculture products can be delivered to market via standard transport.

One disadvantage of land-based facilities arises from the turbulent wave action in the surf zone. OTEC discharge pipes should be placed in protective trenches to prevent subjecting them to extreme stress during storms and prolonged periods of heavy seas. Also, the mixed discharge of cold and warm seawater may need to be carried several hundred meters offshore to reach the proper depth before it is released, requiring additional expense in construction and maintenance.

One way that OTEC systems can avoid some of the problems and expenses of operating in a surf zone is by building them just offshore in waters ranging from 10 to 30 meters deep (Ocean Thermal Corporation 1984). This type of plant would use shorter (and therefore less costly) intake and discharge pipes, which would avoid the dangers of turbulent surf. The plant itself, however, would require protection from the marine environment, such as breakwaters and erosion-resistant foundations, and the plant output would need to be transmitted to shore.

=== Shelf based ===

To avoid the turbulent surf zone as well as to move closer to the cold-water resource, OTEC plants can be mounted to the continental shelf at depths up to . A shelf-mounted plant could be towed to the site and affixed to the sea bottom. This type of construction is already used for offshore oil rigs. The complexities of operating an OTEC plant in deeper water may make them more expensive than land-based approaches. Problems include the stress of open-ocean conditions and more difficult product delivery. Addressing strong ocean currents and large waves adds engineering and construction expense. Platforms require extensive pilings to maintain a stable base. Power delivery can require long underwater cables to reach land. For these reasons, shelf-mounted plants are less attractive. 

=== Floating ===

Floating OTEC facilities operate off-shore. Although potentially optimal for large systems, floating facilities present several difficulties. The difficulty of mooring plants in very deep water complicates power delivery. Cables attached to floating platforms are more susceptible to damage, especially during storms. Cables at depths greater than 1000 meters are difficult to maintain and repair. Riser cables, which connect the sea bed and the plant, need to be constructed to resist entanglement.

As with shelf-mounted plants, floating plants need a stable base for continuous operation. Major storms and heavy seas can break the vertically suspended cold-water pipe and interrupt warm water intake as well. To help prevent these problems, pipes can be made of flexible polyethylene attached to the bottom of the platform and gimballed with joints or collars. Pipes may need to be uncoupled from the plant to prevent storm damage. As an alternative to a warm-water pipe, surface water can be drawn directly into the platform; however, it is necessary to prevent the intake flow from being damaged or interrupted during violent motions caused by heavy seas.

Connecting a floating plant to power delivery cables requires the plant to remain relatively stationary. Mooring is an acceptable method, but current mooring technology is limited to depths of about . Even at shallower depths, the cost of mooring may be prohibitive.

== Political concerns ==

Because OTEC facilities are more-or-less stationary surface platforms, their exact location and legal status may be affected by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea treaty (UNCLOS). This treaty grants coastal nations zones of varying legal authority from land, creating potential conflicts and regulatory barriers. OTEC plants and similar structures would be considered artificial islands under the treaty, giving them no independent legal status. OTEC plants could be perceived as either a threat or potential partner to fisheries or to seabed mining operations controlled by the International Seabed Authority.

== Cost and economics ==

Because OTEC systems have not yet been widely deployed, cost estimates are uncertain. A 2010 study by University of Hawaii estimated the cost of electricity for OTEC at 94.0 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) for a 1.4 MW plant, 44.0 cents per kWh for a 10 MW plant, and 18.0 cents per kWh for a 100 MW plant. A 2015 report by the organization Ocean Energy Systems under the International Energy Agency gave an estimate of about 20.0 cents per kWh for 100 MW plants. Another study estimated power generation costs as low as 7.0 cents per kWh. Comparing to other energy sources, a 2019 study by Lazard estimated the unsubsidized cost of electricity to 3.2 to 4.2 cents per kWh for Solar PV at utility scale and 2.8 to 5.4 cents per kWh for wind power.

A report published by IRENA in 2014 claimed that commercial use of OTEC technology can be scaled in a variety of ways. “...small-scale OTEC plants can be made to accommodate the electricity production of small communities (5,000–50,000 residents), but would require the production of valuable by-products – like fresh water or cooling – to be economically viable”. Larger scaled OTEC plants would have a much higher overhead and installation costs.

Beneficial factors that should be taken into account include OTEC&#x27;s lack of waste products and fuel consumption, the area in which it is available (often within 20° of the equator), the geopolitical effects of petroleum dependence, compatibility with alternate forms of ocean power such as wave energy, tidal energy and methane hydrates, and supplemental uses for the seawater.

== Some proposed projects ==

OTEC projects under consideration include a small plant for the U.S. Navy base on the British overseas territory island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation (formerly OCEES International, Inc.) is working with the U.S. Navy on a design for a proposed 13-MW OTEC plant, to replace the current diesel generators. The OTEC plant would also provide 1.25 million gallons per day of potable water. This project is currently waiting for changes in US military contract policies. OTE has proposed building a 10-MW OTEC plant on Guam.

=== Bahamas ===

Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation (OTE) currently has plans to install two 10 MW OTEC plants in the US Virgin Islands and a 5–10 MW OTEC facility in The Bahamas. OTE has also designed the world&#x27;s largest Seawater Air Conditioning (SWAC) plant for a resort in The Bahamas, which will use cold deep seawater as a method of air-conditioning. In mid-2015, the 95%-complete project was temporarily put on hold while the resort resolved financial and ownership issues. On August 22, 2016, the government of the Bahamas announced that a new agreement had been signed under which the Baha Mar resort will be completed. On September 27, 2016, Bahamian Prime Minister Perry Christie announced that construction had resumed on Baha Mar, and that the resort was slated to open in March 2017.

This is on hold, and may never resume.

=== Hawaii ===

Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Alternative Energy Development team has partnered with Makai Ocean Engineering
to complete the final design phase of a 10-MW closed cycle OTEC pilot system which planned to become operational in Hawaii in the 2012–2013 time frame. This system was designed to expand to 100-MW commercial systems in the near future. In November, 2010 the U.S. Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) awarded Lockheed Martin a US$4.4 million contract modification to develop critical system components and designs for the plant, adding to the 2009 $8.1 million contract and two Department of Energy grants totaling over $1 million in 2008 and March 2010.
A small but operational ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) plant was inaugurated in Hawaii in August 2015. The opening of the research and development 100-kilowatt facility marked the first time a closed-cycle OTEC plant was connected to the U.S. grid.

=== Hainan ===

On April 13, 2013, Lockheed contracted with the Reignwood Group to build a 10 megawatt plant off the coast of southern China to provide power for a planned resort on Hainan island. A plant of that size would power several thousand homes. The Reignwood Group acquired Opus Offshore in 2011 which forms its Reignwood Ocean Engineering division which also is engaged in development of deepwater drilling.

=== Japan ===

Currently the only continuously operating OTEC system is located in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The Governmental support, local community support, and advanced research carried out by Saga University were key for the contractors, IHI Plant Construction Co. Ltd, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, and Xenesys Inc, to succeed with this project. Work is being conducted to develop a 1MW facility on Kume Island requiring new pipelines. In July 2014, more than 50 members formed the Global Ocean reSource and Energy Association (GOSEA) an international organization formed to promote the development of the Kumejima Model and work towards the installation of larger deep seawater pipelines and a 1MW OTEC Facility. The companies involved in the current OTEC projects, along with other interested parties have developed plans for offshore OTEC systems as well. - For more details, see &quot;Currently Operating OTEC Plants&quot; above.

=== United States Virgin Islands ===

On March 5, 2014, Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation (OTEC) and the 30th Legislature of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to move forward with a study to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits to the USVI of installing on-shore Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) renewable energy power plants and Seawater Air Conditioning (SWAC) facilities. The benefits to be assessed in the USVI study include both the baseload (24/7) clean electricity generated by OTEC, as well as the various related products associated with OTEC and SWAC, including abundant fresh drinking water, energy-saving air conditioning, sustainable aquaculture and mariculture, and agricultural enhancement projects for the Islands of St Thomas and St Croix.

On July 18, 2016, OTE&#x27;s application to be a Qualifying Facility was approved by the Virgin Islands Public Services Commission. OTE also received permission to begin negotiating contracts associated with this project.

=== Kiribati ===
South Korea&#x27;s Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering (KRISO) received approval in principle from Bureau Veritas for their 1MW offshore OTEC design. No timeline was given for the project which will be located 6 km offshore of the Republic of Kiribati.

=== Martinique ===
Akuo Energy and DCNS were awarded NER300 funding on July 8, 2014 for their NEMO (New Energy for Martinique and Overseas) project which is expected to be a 10.7MW-net offshore facility completed in 2020. The award to help with development totaled 72 million Euro.

=== Maldives ===
On February 16, 2018, Global OTEC Resources announced plans to build a 150 kW plant in the Maldives, designed bespoke for hotels and resorts. &quot;All these resorts draw their power from diesel generators. Moreover, some individual resorts consume 7,000 litres of diesel a day to meet demands which equates to over 6,000 tonnes of CO2 annually,&quot; said Director Dan Grech. The EU awarded a grant and Global OTEC resources launched a crowdfunding campaign for the rest.

== Related activities ==

OTEC has uses other than power production.

=== Desalination ===

Desalinated water can be produced in open- or hybrid-cycle plants using surface condensers to turn evaporated seawater into potable water. System analysis indicates that a 2-megawatt plant could produce about of desalinated water each day. Another system patented by Richard Bailey creates condensate water by regulating deep ocean water flow through surface condensers correlating with fluctuating dew-point temperatures. This condensation system uses no incremental energy and has no moving parts.

On March 22, 2015, Saga University opened a Flash-type desalination demonstration facility on Kumejima. This satellite of their Institute of Ocean Energy uses post-OTEC deep seawater from the Okinawa OTEC Demonstration Facility and raw surface seawater to produce desalinated water. Air is extracted from the closed system with a vacuum pump. When raw sea water is pumped into the flash chamber it boils, allowing pure steam to rise and the salt and remaining seawater to be removed. The steam is returned to liquid in a heat exchanger with cold post-OTEC deep seawater. The desalinated water can be used in hydrogen production or drinking water (if minerals are added).

The NELHA plant established in 1993 produced an average of 7,000 gallons of freshwater per day. KOYO USA was established in 2002 to capitalize on this new economic opportunity. KOYO bottles the water produced by the NELHA plant in Hawaii. With the capacity to produce one million bottles of water every day, KOYO is now Hawaii&#x27;s biggest exporter with $140 million in sales.[81]

=== Air conditioning ===

The cold seawater made available by an OTEC system creates an opportunity to provide large amounts of cooling to industries and homes near the plant. The water can be used in chilled-water coils to provide air conditioning for buildings. It is estimated that a pipe in diameter can deliver 4,700 gallons of water per minute. Water at could provide more than enough air conditioning for a large building. Operating 8,000 hours per year in lieu of electrical conditioning selling for 5–10¢ per kilowatt-hour, it would save $200,000-$400,000 in energy bills annually.

The InterContinental Resort and Thalasso-Spa on the island of Bora Bora uses an SWAC system to air-condition its buildings. The system passes seawater through a heat exchanger where it cools freshwater in a closed loop system. This freshwater is then pumped to buildings and directly cools the air.

In 2010, Copenhagen Energy opened a district cooling plant in Copenhagen, Denmark. The plant delivers cold seawater to commercial and industrial buildings, and has reduced electricity consumption by 80 percent. Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation (OTE) has designed a 9800-ton SDC system for a vacation resort in The Bahamas.

=== Chilled-soil agriculture ===

OTEC technology supports chilled-soil agriculture. When cold seawater flows through underground pipes, it chills the surrounding soil. The temperature difference between roots in the cool soil and leaves in the warm air allows plants that evolved in temperate climates to be grown in the subtropics. Dr. John P. Craven, Dr. Jack Davidson and Richard Bailey patented this process and demonstrated it at a research facility at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA). The research facility demonstrated that more than 100 different crops can be grown using this system. Many normally could not survive in Hawaii or at Keahole Point.

Japan has also been researching agricultural uses of Deep Sea Water since 2000 at the Okinawa Deep Sea Water Research Institute on Kume Island. The Kume Island facilities use regular water cooled by Deep Sea Water in a heat exchanger run through pipes in the ground to cool soil. Their techniques have developed an important resource for the island community as they now produce spinach, a winter vegetable, commercially year round. An expansion of the deep seawater agriculture facility was completed by Kumejima Town next to the OTEC Demonstration Facility in 2014. The new facility is for researching the economic practicality of chilled-soil agriculture on a larger scale.

=== Aquaculture ===

Aquaculture is the best-known byproduct, because it reduces the financial and energy costs of pumping large volumes of water from the deep ocean. Deep ocean water contains high concentrations of essential nutrients that are depleted in surface waters due to biological consumption. This artificial upwelling mimics the natural upwellings that are responsible for fertilizing and supporting the world&#x27;s largest marine ecosystems, and the largest densities of life on the planet.

Cold-water sea animals, such as salmon and lobster, thrive in this nutrient-rich, deep seawater. Microalgae such as &quot;Spirulina&quot;, a health food supplement, also can be cultivated. Deep-ocean water can be combined with surface water to deliver water at an optimal temperature.

Non-native species such as salmon, lobster, abalone, trout, oysters, and clams can be raised in pools supplied by OTEC-pumped water. This extends the variety of fresh seafood products available for nearby markets. Such low-cost refrigeration can be used to maintain the quality of harvested fish, which deteriorate quickly in warm tropical regions. In Kona, Hawaii, aquaculture companies working with NELHA generate about $40 million annually, a significant portion of Hawaii&#x27;s GDP.

=== Hydrogen production ===

Hydrogen can be produced via electrolysis using OTEC electricity. Generated steam with electrolyte compounds added to improve efficiency is a relatively pure medium for hydrogen production. OTEC can be scaled to generate large quantities of hydrogen. The main challenge is cost relative to other energy sources and fuels.

=== Mineral extraction ===

The ocean contains 57 trace elements in salts and other forms and dissolved in solution. In the past, most economic analyses concluded that mining the ocean for trace elements would be unprofitable, in part because of the energy required to pump the water. Mining generally targets minerals that occur in high concentrations, and can be extracted easily, such as magnesium. With OTEC plants supplying water, the only cost is for extraction.
The Japanese investigated the possibility of extracting uranium and found developments in other technologies (especially materials sciences) were improving the prospects.

===Climate control===

Ocean thermal gradient can be used to enhance rainfall and moderate the high ambient summer temperatures in tropics to benefit enormously the mankind and the flora and fauna. When sea surface temperatures are relatively high on an area, lower atmospheric pressure area is formed compared to atmospheric pressure prevailing on the nearby land mass inducing winds from the landmass towards the ocean. Oceanward winds are dry and warm which would not contribute to good rainfall on the landmass compared to landward moist winds. For adequate rainfall and comfortable summer ambient temperatures (below 35 °C) on the landmass, it is preferred to have landward moist winds from the ocean. Creating high pressure zones by artificial upwelling on sea area selectively can also be used to deflect / guide the normal monsoon global winds towards the landmass. Artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface also enhances fisheries growth in areas with tropical and temperate weather. It would also lead to enhanced carbon sequestration by the oceans from improved algae growth and mass gain by glaciers from the extra snow fall mitigating sea level rise or global warming process. Tropical cyclones also do not pass through the high pressure zones as they intensify by gaining energy from the warm surface waters of the sea.

The cold deep sea water (&lt;10 °C) is pumped to the sea surface area to suppress the sea surface temperature (&gt;26 °C) by artificial means using electricity produced by mega scale floating wind turbine plants on the deep sea. The lower sea water surface temperature would enhance the local ambient pressure so that atmospheric landward winds are created. For upwelling the cold sea water, a stationary hydraulically driven propeller (≈50 m diameter) is located on the deep sea floor at 500 to 1000 m depth with a flexible draft tube extending up to the sea surface. The draft tube is anchored to the sea bed at its bottom side and top side to floating pontoons at the sea surface. The flexible draft tube would not collapse as its inside pressure is more compared to outside pressure when the colder water is pumped to the sea surface. Middle east, north east Africa, Indian subcontinent and Australia can get relief from hot and dry weather in summer season, also prone to erratic rainfall, by pumping deep sea water to the sea surface from the Persian gulf, Red sea, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean respectively.

== Thermodynamics ==

A rigorous treatment of OTEC reveals that a 20 °C temperature difference will provide as much energy as a hydroelectric plant with 34 m head for the same volume of water flow.
The low temperature difference means that water volumes must be very large to extract useful amounts of heat. A 100MW power plant would be expected to pump on the order of 12 million gallons (44,400 tonnes) per minute. For comparison, pumps must move a mass of water greater than the weight of the &quot;battleship Bismarck&quot;, which weighed 41,700 tonnes, every minute. This makes pumping a substantial parasitic drain on energy production in OTEC systems, with one Lockheed design consuming 19.55 MW in pumping costs for every 49.8 MW net electricity generated. For OTEC schemes using heat exchangers, to handle this volume of water the exchangers need to be enormous compared to those used in conventional thermal power generation plants, making them one of the most critical components due to their impact on overall efficiency. A 100 MW OTEC power plant would require 200 exchangers each larger than a 20-foot shipping container making them the single most expensive component.

=== Variation of ocean temperature with depth ===

The total insolation received by the oceans (covering 70% of the earth&#x27;s surface, with clearness index of 0.5 and average energy retention of 15%) is: 

We can use Beer–Lambert–Bouguer&#x27;s law to quantify the solar energy absorption by water,

:formula_1

where, &quot;y&quot; is the depth of water, &quot;I&quot; is intensity and &quot;μ&quot; is the absorption coefficient.
Solving the above differential equation,

:formula_2

The absorption coefficient &quot;μ&quot; may range from 0.05 m−1 for very clear fresh water to 0.5 m−1 for very salty water.

Since the intensity falls exponentially with depth &quot;y&quot;, heat absorption is concentrated at the top layers. Typically in the tropics, surface temperature values are in excess of , while at , the temperature is about . The warmer (and hence lighter) waters at the surface means there are no thermal convection currents. Due to the small temperature gradients, heat transfer by conduction is too low to equalize the temperatures. The ocean is thus both a practically infinite heat source and a practically infinite heat sink.

This temperature difference varies with latitude and season, with the maximum in tropical, subtropical and equatorial waters. Hence the tropics are generally the best OTEC locations.

=== Open/Claude cycle ===

In this scheme, warm surface water at around enters an evaporator at pressure slightly below the saturation pressures causing it to vaporize.

:formula_3

Where &quot;H&quot; is enthalpy of liquid water at the inlet temperature, &quot;T&quot;.

This temporarily superheated water undergoes volume boiling as opposed to pool boiling in conventional boilers where the heating surface is in contact. Thus the water partially flashes to steam with two-phase equilibrium prevailing. Suppose that the pressure inside the evaporator is maintained at the saturation pressure, &quot;T&quot;.

:formula_4

Here, &quot;x&quot; is the fraction of water by mass that vaporizes. The warm water mass flow rate per unit turbine mass flow rate is 1/&quot;x&quot;.

The low pressure in the evaporator is maintained by a vacuum pump that also removes the dissolved non-condensable gases from the evaporator. The evaporator now contains a mixture of water and steam of very low vapor quality (steam content). The steam is separated from the water as saturated vapor. The remaining water is saturated and is discharged to the ocean in the open cycle. The steam is a low pressure/high specific volume working fluid. It expands in a special low pressure turbine.

:formula_5

Here, &quot;H&quot; corresponds to &quot;T&quot;. For an ideal isentropic (reversible adiabatic) turbine,

:formula_6

The above equation corresponds to the temperature at the exhaust of the turbine, &quot;T&quot;. &quot;x&quot; is the mass fraction of vapor at state 5.

The enthalpy at &quot;T&quot; is,

:formula_7

This enthalpy is lower. The adiabatic reversible turbine work = &quot;H&quot;-&quot;H&quot;.

Actual turbine work 

:formula_8

The condenser temperature and pressure are lower. Since the turbine exhaust is to be discharged back into the ocean, a direct contact condenser is used to mix the exhaust with cold water, which results in a near-saturated water. That water is now discharged back to the ocean.

&quot;H&quot;=&quot;H&quot;, at &quot;T&quot;. &quot;T&quot; is the temperature of the exhaust mixed with cold sea water, as the vapor content now is negligible,

:formula_9

The temperature differences between stages include that between warm surface water and working steam, that between exhaust steam and cooling water, and that between cooling water reaching the condenser and deep water. These represent external irreversibilities that reduce the overall temperature difference.

The cold water flow rate per unit turbine mass flow rate,

:formula_10

Turbine mass flow rate, formula_11

Warm water mass flow rate, formula_12

Cold water mass flow rate formula_13

=== Closed Anderson cycle ===

As developed starting in the 1960s by J. Hilbert Anderson of Sea Solar Power, Inc., in this cycle, &quot;Q&quot; is the heat transferred in the evaporator from the warm sea water to the working fluid. The working fluid exits the evaporator as a gas near its dew point.

The high-pressure, high-temperature gas then is expanded in the turbine to yield turbine work, &quot;W&quot;. The working fluid is slightly superheated at the turbine exit and the turbine typically has an efficiency of 90% based on reversible, adiabatic expansion.

From the turbine exit, the working fluid enters the condenser where it rejects heat, &quot;-Q&quot;, to the cold sea water. The condensate is then compressed to the highest pressure in the cycle, requiring condensate pump work, &quot;W&quot;. Thus, the Anderson closed cycle is a Rankine-type cycle similar to the conventional power plant steam cycle except that in the Anderson cycle the working fluid is never superheated more than a few degrees Fahrenheit. Owing to viscosity effects, working fluid pressure drops in both the evaporator and the condenser. This pressure drop, which depends on the types of heat exchangers used, must be considered in final design calculations but is ignored here to simplify the analysis. Thus, the parasitic condensate pump work, &quot;W&quot;, computed here will be lower than if the heat exchanger pressure drop was included. The major additional parasitic energy requirements in the OTEC plant are the cold water pump work, &quot;W&quot;, and the warm water pump work, &quot;W&quot;. Denoting all other parasitic energy requirements by &quot;W&quot;, the net work from the OTEC plant, &quot;W&quot; is

:formula_14

The thermodynamic cycle undergone by the working fluid can be analyzed without detailed consideration of the parasitic energy requirements. From the first law of thermodynamics, the energy balance for the working fluid as the system is

:formula_15

where is the net work for the thermodynamic cycle. For the idealized case in which there is no working fluid pressure drop in the heat exchangers,

:formula_16

and

:formula_17

so that the net thermodynamic cycle work becomes

:formula_18

Subcooled liquid enters the evaporator. Due to the heat exchange with warm sea water, evaporation takes place and usually superheated vapor leaves the evaporator. This vapor drives the turbine and the 2-phase mixture enters the condenser. Usually, the subcooled liquid leaves the condenser and finally, this liquid is pumped to the evaporator completing a cycle.

== Environmental impact ==

Carbon dioxide dissolved in deep cold and high pressure layers is brought up to the surface and released as the water warms. 

Mixing of deep ocean water with shallower water brings up nutrients and makes them available to shallow water life. This may be an advantage for aquaculture of commercially important species, but may also unbalance the ecological system around the power plant.

OTEC plants use very large flows of warm surface seawater and cold deep seawater to generate constant renewable power. The deep seawater is oxygen deficient and generally 20–40 times more nutrient rich (in nitrate and nitrite) than shallow seawater. When these plumes are mixed, they are slightly denser than the ambient seawater. Though no large scale physical environmental testing of OTEC has been done, computer models have been developed to simulate the effect of OTEC plants.

=== Hydrodynamic modeling ===

In 2010, a computer model was developed to simulate the physical oceanographic effects of one or several 100 megawatt OTEC plant(s). The model suggests that OTEC plants can be configured such that the plant can conduct continuous operations, with resulting temperature and nutrient variations that are within naturally occurring levels. Studies to date suggest that by discharging the OTEC flows downwards at a depth below 70 meters, the dilution is adequate and nutrient enrichment is small enough so that 100-megawatt OTEC plants could be operated in a sustainable manner on a continuous basis.

=== Biological modeling ===

The nutrients from an OTEC discharge could potentially cause increased biological activity if they accumulate in large quantities in the photic zone. In 2011 a biological component was added to the hydrodynamic computer model to simulate the biological response to plumes from 100 megawatt OTEC plants. In all cases modeled (discharge at 70 meters depth or more), no unnatural variations occurs in the upper 40 meters of the ocean&#x27;s surface. The picoplankton response in the 110 - 70 meter depth layer is approximately a 10–25% increase, which is well within naturally occurring variability. The nanoplankton response is negligible. The enhanced productivity of diatoms (microplankton) is small. The subtle phytoplankton increase of the baseline OTEC plant suggests that higher-order biochemical effects will be very small.

=== Studies ===

A previous Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the United States&#x27; NOAA from 1981 is available, but needs to be brought up to current oceanographic and engineering standards. Studies have been done to propose the best environmental baseline monitoring practices, focusing on a set of ten chemical oceanographic parameters relevant to OTEC. Most recently, NOAA held an OTEC Workshop in 2010 and 2012 seeking to assess the physical, chemical, and biological impacts and risks, and identify information gaps or needs.

The Tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of OTEC.

== Technical difficulties ==

=== Dissolved gases ===

The performance of direct contact heat exchangers operating at typical OTEC boundary conditions is important to the Claude cycle. Many early Claude cycle designs used a surface condenser since their performance was well understood. However, direct contact condensers offer significant disadvantages. As cold water rises in the intake pipe, the pressure decreases to the point where gas begins to evolve. If a significant amount of gas comes out of solution, placing a gas trap before the direct contact heat exchangers may be justified. Experiments simulating conditions in the warm water intake pipe indicated about 30% of the dissolved gas evolves in the top of the tube. The trade-off between pre-deaeration of the seawater and expulsion of non-condensable gases from the condenser is dependent on the gas evolution dynamics, deaerator efficiency, head loss, vent compressor efficiency and parasitic power. Experimental results indicate vertical spout condensers perform some 30% better than falling jet types.

=== Microbial fouling ===

Because raw seawater must pass through the heat exchanger, care must be taken to maintain good thermal conductivity. Biofouling layers as thin as can degrade heat exchanger performance by as much as 50%. A 1977 study in which mock heat exchangers were exposed to seawater for ten weeks concluded that although the level of microbial fouling was low, the thermal conductivity of the system was significantly impaired. The apparent discrepancy between the level of fouling and the heat transfer impairment is the result of a thin layer of water trapped by the microbial growth on the surface of the heat exchanger.

Another study concluded that fouling degrades performance over time, and determined that although regular brushing was able to remove most of the microbial layer, over time a tougher layer formed that could not be removed through simple brushing. The study passed sponge rubber balls through the system. It concluded that although the ball treatment decreased the fouling rate it was not enough to completely halt growth and brushing was occasionally necessary to restore capacity. The microbes regrew more quickly later in the experiment (i.e. brushing became necessary more often) replicating the results of a previous study. The increased growth rate after subsequent cleanings appears to result from selection pressure on the microbial colony.

Continuous use of 1 hour per day and intermittent periods of free fouling and then chlorination periods (again 1 hour per day) were studied. Chlorination slowed but did not stop microbial growth; however chlorination levels of 0.1 mg per liter for 1 hour per day may prove effective for long term operation of a plant. The study concluded that although microbial fouling was an issue for the warm surface water heat exchanger, the cold water heat exchanger suffered little or no biofouling and only minimal inorganic fouling.

Besides water temperature, microbial fouling also depends on nutrient levels, with growth occurring faster in nutrient rich water. The fouling rate also depends on the material used to construct the heat exchanger. Aluminium tubing slows the growth of microbial life, although the oxide layer which forms on the inside of the pipes complicates cleaning and leads to larger efficiency losses. In contrast, titanium tubing allows biofouling to occur faster but cleaning is more effective than with aluminium.

=== Sealing ===

The evaporator, turbine, and condenser operate in partial vacuum ranging from 3% to 1% of atmospheric pressure. The system must be carefully sealed to prevent in-leakage of atmospheric air that can degrade or shut down operation. In closed-cycle OTEC, the specific volume of low-pressure steam is very large compared to that of the pressurized working fluid. Components must have large flow areas to ensure steam velocities do not attain excessively high values.

=== Parasitic power consumption by exhaust compressor ===

An approach for reducing the exhaust compressor parasitic power loss is as follows. After most of the steam has been condensed by spout condensers, the non-condensible gas steam mixture is passed through a counter current region which increases the gas-steam reaction by a factor of five. The result is an 80% reduction in the exhaust pumping power requirements.

== Cold air/warm water conversion ==

In winter in coastal Arctic locations, the temperature difference between the seawater and ambient air can be as high as 40 °C (72 °F). Closed-cycle systems could exploit the air-water temperature difference. Eliminating seawater extraction pipes might make a system based on this concept less expensive than OTEC. This technology is due to H. Barjot, who suggested butane as cryogen, because of its boiling point of and its non-solubility in water. Assuming a realistic level of efficiency of 4%, calculations show that the amount of energy generated with one cubic meter water at a temperature of in a place with an air temperature of equals the amount of energy generated by letting this cubic meter water run through a hydroelectric plant of 4000 feet (1,200 m) height.

Barjot Polar Power Plants could be located on islands in the polar region or designed as swimming barges or platforms attached to the ice cap. The weather station Myggbuka at Greenlands east coast for example, which is only 2,100 km away from Glasgow, detects monthly mean temperatures below during 6 winter months in the year.

== Application of the thermoelectric effect ==

In 1979 SERI proposed using the Seebeck effect to produce power with a total conversion efficiency of 2%.

In 2014 Liping Liu, Associate Professor at Rutgers University, envisioned an OTEC system that utilises the solid state thermoelectric effect rather than the fluid cycles traditionally used.

Altman referred to it as an &quot;anti-Western&quot; film because it ignores or subverts a number of Western conventions. It was filmed in British Columbia, Canada in the fall and winter of 1970, and premiered on June 24, 1971.

The film has received critical acclaim in the years since its release and earned an Oscar nomination for Christie in the Best Actress category. The film was deemed the 8th greatest Western of all time by the American Film Institute in its AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 list in 2008 and, in 2010, was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot summary==
In 1902, a mysterious gambler named John McCabe arrives in the unincorporated boomtown of Presbyterian Church, Washington, named after its only substantial building, a tall but mostly unused chapel. McCabe quickly takes a dominant position over the town&#x27;s simple-minded and lethargic inhabitants, thanks to his aggressive personality and persistent rumors that he is actually a notorious gunfighter known as &quot;Pudgy&quot; McCabe.

To support himself, McCabe establishes a makeshift brothel, consisting of three prostitutes purchased for $200 from a pimp in the nearby town of Bearpaw. British cockney madam Constance Miller arrives and persuades McCabe to let her manage his brothel while he focuses on running a gambling hall. The two become financially successful business partners, turning their small business into the largest in town, and a romantic relationship develops between the two, though she charges him for sex.

As the town becomes richer, Sears and Hollander, a pair of agents from the Harrison Shaughnessy Mining Company in Bearpaw, arrive to buy out McCabe&#x27;s business, as well as the surrounding zinc mines. Harrison Shaughnessy is notorious for having people killed when they refuse to sell. McCabe does not want to sell at their initial price of $5,500 but overplays his hand in negotiations by demanding too high an asking price. The agents leave in disgust, and Miller warns him that they will not return to negotiate and that his life is in danger.

Hired guns Butler, Breed and Kid arrive in town with a contract to kill McCabe. Appearing fearful, McCabe relents and agrees to sell. Butler refuses to parlay, declaring that McCabe is a fraud and has never killed anyone in his life. McCabe goes back to Bearpaw to find the agents, but after learning that neither are still around, he visits a lawyer, Clement Samuels, in the hopes of resolving the dispute peacefully. The lawyer, an aspiring politician, boosts McCabe&#x27;s confidence and convinces him not to give in by arguing that he can set an example by standing up to Harrison Shaughnessy.

McCabe returns to town and tries to hide in the chapel, but the pastor grabs his shotgun and chases him out before being fatally shot by Butler. A broken lantern starts a fire in the church and the townspeople rush to help extinguish it. McCabe manages to kill Breed and the Kid in ambushes, but the Kid is able to wound him before dying. As the townsfolk mobilize to fight the chapel fire, McCabe is gunned down by Butler, using a hunting rifle; as Butler attempts to verify the kill, McCabe pulls a derringer and kills him. As the townspeople celebrate extinguishing the fire, McCabe dies alone in the snow, while Mrs. Miller lies sedated in an opium den.

===Development===
&quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; is based on Edmund Naughton&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;McCabe&quot;. David Foster, one of the film&#x27;s producers, had purchased the film rights to the novel in 1968; he&#x27;d learned of the novel while negotiating with Ellen Wright (the widow of novelist Richard Wright) over the rights to &quot;The Mandarins&quot;, a novel by Simone de Beauvoir. Wright was acting as the agent for Naughton, who was then living in Paris and working for the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;. With his partner, Mitchell Broward, Foster then negotiated a deal with the Fox studio for two films. By October, 1968, Foster had commissioned a screenplay from Ben Maddow, a well-known poet and screenwriter.

In 1969, Altman was in post-production on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and snuck Foster into the screening; Foster liked the film and signed Altman to direct a film based on &quot;McCabe&quot;. They agreed to wait until &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; became a box-office hit to take the pitch for &quot;McCabe&quot; to a studio for funding. A second screenplay – independent of Maddow&#x27;s – was commissioned from Brian McKay, who completed it in only five weeks. A revised version of that screenplay dated July 1970 became the &quot;shooting script&quot; for the film. Altman and McKay are listed in the film&#x27;s credits as its screenwriters; Maddow went uncredited.

Altman offered the lead to Elliott Gould who turned it down to make &quot;I Love My Wife&quot;. &quot;Bob said, &#x27;You&#x27;re making the mistake of your life&#x27;,&quot; said Gould. &quot;There was a part of me that was not developed at all and that had no real understanding about what the woman is. Bob wanted to cast Patricia Quinn as Mrs. Miller, and I hadn&#x27;t seen &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; and I hadn&#x27;t met her. I had some misconceptions because I wanted her to have the same relationship with Altman as I had. I recently watched &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; and she&#x27;s great. Altman was so right.&quot;

Foster called Warren Beatty in England, about the film; Beatty flew to New York City to see &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and then flew to Los Angeles, California to sign for &quot;McCabe&quot;.

The film was originally called &quot;The Presbyterian Church Wager&quot;, after a bet placed among the church&#x27;s few attendees, about whether McCabe would survive his refusal of the offer to buy his property. Altman reported that an official in the Presbyterian Church called Warner Bros., to complain about having its church mentioned in a film about brothels and gambling. The complaint prompted a name change to &quot;John Mac Cabe&quot; but it was released as &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot;.

===Filming===

The film was shot in West Vancouver and in Squamish, almost in sequential order, a rarity for film makers. The crew found a suitable location for the filming and built up the &quot;set&quot;, as McCabe built up the town in the film. Mrs. Miller is brought into town on a J. I. Case 80 HP steam engine from 1912; the steam engine is genuine and functioning and the crew used it to power the lumbermill after its arrival. Carpenters for the film were locals and young men from the United States, fleeing conscription into the Vietnam War; they were dressed in period costume and used tools of the period, so that they could go about their business in the background, while the plot advanced in the foreground.

The crew ran buried hoses throughout the town, placed so they could create the appearance of rain. Since the city of Vancouver generally receives a great deal of rain, it was usually only necessary to turn on the hoses to make scenes shot on the rare days when it didn&#x27;t rain, to match those shot on days when it did.

It began snowing near the end of shooting, when the church fire and the standoff were the only scenes left. Beatty did not want to start shooting in the snow, as it was financially risky to do so: to preserve continuity, the rest of the film would have to be shot in snow. Altman countered that since those were the only scenes left to film, it was best to start since there was nothing else to do. The &quot;standoff&quot; scene—which is in fact more a &quot;cat and mouse&quot; scene involving shooting one&#x27;s enemy in the back—and its concurrent church fire scene, were shot over nine days. The heavy snow, with the exception of a few &quot;fill-in&quot; patches on the ground, was genuine; the crew members built snowmen and had snowball fights between takes.

The film, especially the final scene, is atypical of the western genre. The showdown between a reluctant protagonist and his enemies takes place ungracefully in the snow during the early hours, rather than at &quot;high noon&quot;. Instead of hiding indoors and watching the battle unfold outside, the townsfolk are bustling in the streets and largely unaware of the gunfight taking place in their midst. For a distinctive look, Altman and Zsigmond chose to &quot;flash&quot; (pre-fog) the film negative before its eventual exposure, as well as use a number of filters on the cameras, rather than manipulate the film in post-production; in this way the studio could not force him to change the film&#x27;s look to something less distinctive.

=== Editing ===
The editing of &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; took much longer than its filming. Altman and Lou Lombardo, the editor and second unit director, spent nine months editing the film in North Vancouver, close to the location of the filming itself. The editing was an innovation in its time because the principal storyline about John McCabe and Constance Miller occupies relatively little of the film&#x27;s running time, especially in the first half of the film. Pauline Kael emphasized this in her 1971 review of the film. She wrote,

The classical story is only a thread in the story that Altman is telling ... The people who drop in and out of the place—a primitive mining town—are not just background for McCabe and Mrs. Miller; McCabe and Mrs. Miller are simply the two most interesting people in the town, and we catch their stories in glimpses, as they interact with the other characters and each other ... Lives are picked up and let go, and the sense of how little we know about them becomes part of the texture; we generally know little about the characters in movies, but since we&#x27;re assured that that little is all we need to know, and thus all there is to know, we&#x27;re not bothered by it. Here we seem to be witnesses to a vision of the past ...

This aspect of the film&#x27;s editing also carried through into the film&#x27;s unusual sound editing, which can blend many conversations and noises and does not emphasize the principal characters. In his textbook on film production, Bruce Mamer wrote,

Robert Altman was famous for using this style of layered dialogue cutting. The frontier barroom scene that opens his &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (Louis Lombardo, editor) has snippets of conversations underlying the foreground action.

Ken Dancyger describes the effect in terms of its undermining of dialogue as an element in the film,

Many characters speak simultaneously, and we are aware of the discreteness of their conversations, but as their comments bleed into those of others, the effect is to undermine the dialogue. The scene moves dialogue from the informational status it usually occupies to the category of noise. Language becomes a sound effect. When we do hear the dialogue, it is the speaker who is important rather than what is being said.

Similarly, Jay Beck writes

&quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; represents the full-scale launch of the practice of overlapping dialogue in Altman&#x27;s cinema. The visual and acoustic strategies in the film avoid foregrounding the main characters in the narrative and the audience has to work to follow the story, or stories, as they unfold.

=== Leonard Cohen&#x27;s songs ===
Other than the music occurring in the ordinary life of Presbyterian Church, the only music for the film is from three songs composed and performed by Leonard Cohen, a Canadian poet who had released his first album of songs in 1967. Their importance is emphasized by Scott Tobias, who wrote in 2014 that &quot;The film is unimaginable to me without the Cohen songs, which function as these mournful interstitials that unify the entire movie.&quot;

Altman had liked Cohen&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; (1967), immensely, buying additional copies of it after wearing out each vinyl record. He had then forgotten about the album. A few years later, Altman visited Paris, just after finishing shooting &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot;, and rediscovered Cohen&#x27;s album. He had Lou Lombardo, the film&#x27;s editor, use the music to maintain a rhythm for the film (in effect using it as a &quot;temp&quot; track). He later said, &quot;I think the reason they worked was because those lyrics were etched in my subconscious, so when I shot the scenes I fitted them to the songs, as if they were written for them.&quot;

Altman didn&#x27;t expect to be able to procure rights for Cohen&#x27;s music since &quot;McCabe&quot; was a Warner Brothers film and Cohen&#x27;s album was released through Columbia Records. He called Cohen, expecting to trade off his recent success with &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, but found that Cohen had no knowledge of it. Instead, Cohen had loved Altman&#x27;s less popular follow-up film &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot;. Cohen arranged for his record company to license the music cheaply, even writing into the contract that sales of that album after the release of &quot;McCabe&quot; would turn some of the royalties to Altman (an arrangement which at the time was quite unusual). The three Cohen songs used in the film were &quot;The Stranger Song&quot;, &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot; and &quot;Winter Lady&quot;. They were released together on a 7-inch single in France in 1971, and other European countries during 1972.

==Reception==
===Contemporary U.S. reviews===
The film opened without advance screenings at the Criterion and Loew&#x27;s Cine theaters in New York City and received mostly negative reviews from the New York daily newspapers including one from Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who wrote that the film dragged its storyline out with such &quot;tired symbolism&quot; &quot;that the effect is to undercut its narrative drive and the dignity of its fiction.&quot; It was also panned by Rex Reed, who called it &quot;an incoherent, amateurish, simple-minded, boring and totally worthless piece of garbage&quot; and &quot;an insult to the intelligence of anyone stupid or masochistic enough to sit through it&quot;; he added that &quot;at the screening I attended Wednesday night, there were so many boos and hisses and programs thrown at the screen I thought the enraged audience was going to burn down the theater. I wouldn&#x27;t have blamed them.&quot; However, the weekly critics raved about the film including Judith Crist and Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; who called it &quot;a beautiful pipe dream of a movie—a fleeting, almost vision of what frontier life might have been,&quot; adding, &quot;The movie is so affecting it leaves one rather dazed.&quot; As well, Kathleen Carroll of the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and said that &quot;again Altman never states or explains. He suggests the passing of time and one has to catch his clues. His concern is not to unravel a plot, but to capture an atmosphere or a feeling and this he does beautifully even to the point of softening the color so that the film has a faded, antique look to it.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and wrote that it &quot;is like no other Western ever made, and with it, Robert Altman earns his place as one of the best contemporary directors.&quot; He later added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list, where he said &quot;Robert Altman has made a dozen films that can be called great in one way or another, but one of them is perfect, and that one is &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971).&quot; Gene Siskel also awarded it four stars and called it &quot;a brilliant film, not because of the story, but because of the way in which it is told ... To construct such delicate scenes is the hallmark of fine film making and Altman is clearly a master.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;interesting&quot; but &quot;as uneven as the stare of a cheap mirror.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Once again Altman brings a special way of life casually but vibrantly alive. &#x27;McCabe&#x27; is an imaginative triumph partly in a visible, technical sense—a meticulous, conventionally authentic reconstruction of a frontier town—but principally in an emotional sense—a deeply felt and stirring romantic vision of frontier society.&quot;

===Contemporary Canadian reviews===
Les Wedman of the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; noted that &quot;locally, the initial interest is that the movie was shot last winter in West Vancouver and Squamish, but it is going to take more than the stunning and scenic photography of Vilmos [Zsigmond] and the presence of local actors on the screen to sustain audiences even here. And unfortunately, even with varying degrees of performance and the drawing power of stars Warren Beatty and Julie Christie, &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot; doesn&#x27;t have much else.&quot; James Spears, however, wrote in &quot;The Province&quot; that the film &quot;is a beautiful dream, and an important part of the dream of Vancouver.&quot; Daniel Stoffman of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; called it &quot;an hour and a half of Warren Beatty mumbling, Julie Christie scowling, and Leonard Cohen droning on the sound track. It&#x27;s not much else.&quot; Dave Lanken of the Montreal &quot;Gazette&quot; said that &quot;for director Robert Altman, &quot;McCabe&quot; must be a source of satisfaction. So different from his &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; or his &quot;Brewster [McCloud]&quot;, but another little masterpiece.&quot; A critic in the &quot;Montreal Star&quot; called the film &quot;a beautiful but sometimes pretentious outdoors saga.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 85% based on 60 reviews, with an average score of 8.70/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; offers revisionist Western fans a landmark early addition to the genre while marking an early apogee for director Robert Altman.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 93 based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; received five votes in the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls, and in a later BBC poll was voted the 16th greatest American film ever made. In a 2009 interview, the film critic A.O. Scott named it one of his five favorite films.

===Theme===
Film historian James Bernardoni in his book &quot;The New Hollywood&quot; (1991) locates the central theme of the picture within an inherent conflict between human individuality and the requirements of community in a capitalist society. Bernardoni maintains that Robert Altman delivers these personal and social struggles relentlessly — “in every sequence, virtually every frame”— through his handling of Mise-en-scène.

The denouement depicts the mortally wounded McCabe dying alone in a snowbank, and Mrs. Miller, unaware of this demise, descending into a death-like opium trance. As such, “a nuanced, compelling, iconoclastic meditation on the great western theme of the reconciliation of the individual and the community, comes to the end.”

===Accolades===
Julie Christie&#x27;s performance was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Vilmos Zsigmond&#x27;s cinematography received a nomination by the British Academy Film Awards, and the film&#x27;s screenplay garnered a Writers Guild of America nomination. In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; was acknowledged as the eighth best film in the Western genre.

In 2010, &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

===Box office===
With poor initial reviews, the film did not perform well at the box office in New York, but it was more successful in other parts of the country. Warner Bros., encouraged by Beatty, rereleased the film at the Coronet Theatre in New York in August 1971 along with a new advertising campaign, and its box-office performance improved upon that of the original release.

The film earned an estimated $4 million in theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada.

=== Awards and nominations ===
== Home media ==
Warner Home Video released a Region 1 DVD in 2002. The Criterion Collection released a 4K digital transfer of the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 11, 2016. A new 4K UHD physical release from Criterion was released in February, 2024.

<text>Fox hunting is an activity involving the tracking, chase and, if caught, the killing of a fox, normally a red fox, by trained foxhounds or other scent hounds. A group of unarmed followers, led by a &quot;master of foxhounds&quot; (or &quot;master of hounds&quot;), follow the hounds on foot or on horseback.

Fox hunting with hounds, as a formalised activity, originated in England in the sixteenth century, in a form very similar to that practised until February 2005, when a law banning the activity in England and Wales came into force. A ban on hunting in Scotland had been passed in 2002, but it continues to be within the law in Northern Ireland and several other jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland and the United States.

The sport is controversial, particularly in the United Kingdom. Proponents of fox hunting view it as an important part of rural culture and useful for reasons of conservation and pest control, while opponents argue it is cruel and unnecessary.

==History==

The use of scenthounds to track prey dates back to Assyrian, Babylonian, and ancient Egyptian times, and was known as .

===Europe===
Many Greek- and Roman-influenced countries have long traditions of hunting with hounds. Hunting with Agassaei hounds was popular in Celtic Britain, even before the Romans arrived, introducing the Castorian and Fulpine hound breeds which they used to hunt. Norman hunting traditions were brought to Britain when William the Conqueror arrived, along with the Gascon and Talbot hounds.

Foxes were referred to as &quot;beasts of the chase&quot; by medieval times, along with the red deer (hart &amp; hind), martens, and roes, but the earliest known attempt to hunt a fox with hounds was in Norfolk, England, in 1534, where farmers began chasing foxes down with their dogs for the purpose of pest control. The last wolf in England was killed in the late 15th century during the reign of Henry VII, leaving the English fox with no threat from larger predators. The first use of packs specifically trained to hunt foxes was in the late 1600s, with the oldest fox hunt being, probably, the Bilsdale in Yorkshire.

By the end of the seventeenth century, deer hunting was in decline. The inclosure acts brought fences to separate formerly open land into many smaller fields, deer forests were being cut down, and arable land was increasing. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, people began to move out of the country and into towns and cities to find work. Roads, railway lines, and canals all split hunting countries, but at the same time they made hunting accessible to more people. Shotguns were improved during the nineteenth century and the shooting of gamebirds became more popular. Fox hunting developed further in the eighteenth century when Hugo Meynell developed breeds of hound and horse to address the new geography of rural England.

In Germany, hunting with hounds (which tended to be deer or boar hunting) was first banned on the initiative of Hermann Göring on 3 July 1934. In 1939, the ban was extended to cover Austria after Germany&#x27;s annexation of the country. Bernd Ergert, the director of Germany&#x27;s hunting museum in Munich, said of the ban, &quot;The aristocrats were understandably furious, but they could do nothing about the ban given the totalitarian nature of the regime.&quot;

===United States===

According to the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America, Englishman Robert Brooke was the first man to import hunting hounds to what is now the United States, bringing his pack of foxhounds to Maryland in 1650, along with his horses. Also around this time, numbers of European red foxes were introduced into the Eastern seaboard of North America for hunting. The first organised hunt for the benefit of a group (rather than a single patron) was started by Thomas, sixth Lord Fairfax in 1747. In the United States, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both kept packs of foxhounds before and after the American Revolutionary War.

===Australia===
In Australia, the European red fox was introduced solely for the purpose of fox hunting in 1855. Native animal populations have been very badly affected, with the extinction of at least 10 species attributed to the spread of foxes. Fox hunting with hounds is mainly practised in the east of Australia. In the state of Victoria there are thirteen hunts, with more than 1000 members between them. Fox hunting with hounds results in around 650 foxes being killed annually in Victoria, compared with over 90,000 shot over a similar period in response to a State government bounty.
The Adelaide Hunt Club traces its origins to 1840, just a few years after the colonization of South Australia.

==Current status==
===United Kingdom===
Fox hunting is prohibited in Great Britain by the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and the Hunting Act 2004 (England and Wales), passed under the ministry of Tony Blair, but remains legal in Northern Ireland. 
The passing of the Hunting Act was notable in that it was implemented through the use of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, after the House of Lords refused to pass the legislation, despite the Commons passing it by a majority of 356 to 166.

After the ban on fox hunting, hunts in Great Britain switched to legal alternatives, such as drag hunting and trail hunting. The Hunting Act 2004 also permits some previously unusual forms of hunting wild mammals with dogs to continue, such as &quot;hunting... for the purpose of enabling a bird of prey to hunt the wild mammal&quot;.

Opponents of hunting, such as the League Against Cruel Sports, claim that some of these alternatives are a smokescreen for illegal hunting or a means of circumventing the ban. Hunting support group Countryside Alliance said in 2006 that there was anecdotal evidence that the number of foxes killed by hunts (unintentionally) and farmers had increased since the Hunting Act came into force, both by the hunts (through lawful methods) and landowners, and that more people were hunting with hounds (although killing foxes had become illegal).

Tony Blair wrote in &quot;A Journey&quot;, his memoirs published in 2010, that the Hunting Act of 2004 is &#x27;one of the domestic legislative measures I most regret&#x27;.

===United States===
In America, fox hunting is also called &quot;fox chasing&quot;, as it is the practice of many hunts not to actually kill the fox (the red fox is not regarded as a significant pest). Some hunts may go without catching a fox for several seasons, despite chasing two or more foxes in a single day&#x27;s hunting. Foxes are not pursued once they have &quot;gone to ground&quot; (hidden in a hole). American fox hunters undertake stewardship of the land, and endeavour to maintain fox populations and habitats as much as possible. In many areas of the eastern United States the coyote, a natural predator of the red and grey fox, is becoming more prevalent and threatens fox populations in a hunt&#x27;s given territory. In some areas, coyote are considered fair game when hunting with foxhounds, even if they are not the intended species being hunted.

In 2013, the Masters of Foxhounds Association of North America listed 163 registered packs in the US and Canada. This number does not include non-registered (also known as &quot;farmer&quot; or &quot;outlaw&quot;) packs. Baily&#x27;s Hunting Directory Lists 163 foxhound or draghound packs in the US and 11 in Canada In some arid parts of the Western United States, where foxes in general are more difficult to locate, coyotes are hunted and, in some cases, bobcats.

===Other countries===

The other main countries in which organized fox hunting with hounds is practised are Ireland (which has 41 registered packs), Australia, France (this hunting practice is also used for other animals such as deer, wild boar, fox, hare or rabbit), Canada and Italy. There is one pack of foxhounds in Portugal, and one in India. Although there are 32 packs for the hunting of foxes in France, hunting tends to take place mainly on a small scale and on foot, with mounted hunts tending to hunt red or roe deer, or wild boar.

In Portugal fox hunting is permitted (Decree-Law no. 202/2004) but there have been popular protests and initiatives to abolish it. A petition was handed over to the Assembly of the Republic on 18 May 2017 and the parliamentary hearing held in 2018.

In Canada, the Masters of Foxhounds Association of North America lists seven registered hunt clubs in the province of Ontario, one in Quebec, and one in Nova Scotia. Ontario issues licenses to registered hunt clubs, authorizing its members to pursue, chase or search for fox, although the primary target of the hunts is coyotes.

== Quarry animals ==

=== Red fox ===

The red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) is the normal prey animal of a fox hunt in the US and Europe. A small omnivorous predator, the fox lives in burrows called earths, and is predominantly active around twilight (making it a crepuscular animal). Adult foxes tend to range around an area of between square kilometres () in good terrain, although in poor terrain, their range can be as much as . The red fox can run at up to . The fox is also variously known as a &quot;Tod&quot; (old English word for fox), &quot;Reynard&quot; (the name of an anthropomorphic character in European literature from the twelfth century), or &quot;Charlie&quot; (named for the Whig politician Charles James Fox). American red foxes tend to be larger than European forms, but according to foxhunters&#x27; accounts, they have less cunning, vigour and endurance in the chase than European foxes.

=== Coyote, grey fox, and other quarry ===

Other species than the red fox may be the quarry for hounds in some areas. The choice of quarry depends on the region and numbers available.
The coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;) is a significant quarry for many Hunts in North America, particularly in the west and southwest, where there are large open spaces. The coyote is an indigenous predator that did not range east of the Mississippi River until the latter half of the twentieth century. The coyote is faster than a fox, running at and also wider ranging, with a territory of up to , so a much larger hunt territory is required to chase it. However, coyotes tend to be less challenging intellectually, as they offer a straight line hunt instead of the convoluted fox line. Coyotes can be challenging opponents for the dogs in physical confrontations, despite the size advantage of a large dog. Coyotes have larger canine teeth and are generally more practised in hostile encounters.

The grey fox (&quot;Urocyon cinereoargenteus&quot;), a distant relative of the European red fox, is also hunted in North America. It is an adept climber of trees, making it harder to hunt with hounds. The scent of the gray fox is not as strong as that of the red, therefore more time is needed for the hounds to take the scent. Unlike the red fox which, during the chase, will run far ahead from the pack, the gray fox will speed toward heavy brush, thus making it more difficult to pursue. Also unlike the red fox, which occurs more prominently in the northern United States, the more southern gray fox is rarely hunted on horseback, due to its densely covered habitat preferences.

Hunts in the southern United States sometimes pursue the bobcat (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;). In countries such as India, and in other areas formerly under British influence, such as Iraq, the golden jackal (&quot;Canis aureus&quot;) is often the quarry. During the British Raj, British sportsmen in India would hunt jackals on horseback with hounds as a substitute for the fox hunting of their native England. Unlike foxes, golden jackals were documented to be ferociously protective of their pack mates, and could seriously injure hounds. Jackals were not hunted often in this manner, as they were slower than foxes and could scarcely outrun greyhounds after 200 yards.

== Alternatives to hunting live prey ==
Following the ban on fox hunting in Great Britain, hunts switched to legal alternatives in order to preserve their traditional practices, although some hunt supporters had previously claimed this would be impossible and that hound packs would have to be destroyed.

Most hunts turned, primarily, to trail hunting, which anti-hunt organisations claim is just a smokescreen for illegal hunting. Some anti-hunting campaigners have urged hunts to switch to the established sport of drag hunting instead, as this involves significantly less risk of wild animals being accidentally caught and killed.

===Trail hunting===

A controversial alternative to hunting animals with hounds. A trail of animal urine (most commonly fox) is laid in advance of the &#x27;hunt&#x27;, and then tracked by the hound pack and a group of followers; on foot, horseback, or both. Because the trail is laid using animal urine, and in areas where such animals naturally occur, hounds often pick up the scent of live animals; sometimes resulting in them being caught and killed.

===Drag hunting===

An established sport which dates back to the 19th century. Hounds follow an artificial scent, usually aniseed, laid along a set route which is already known to the huntsmen. A drag hunt course is set in a similar manner to a cross country course, following a route over jumps and obstacles. Because it is predetermined, the route can be tailored to keep hounds away from sensitive areas known to be populated by animals which could be confused for prey.

===Hound trailing===

Similar to drag hunting, but in the form of a race; usually of around in length. Unlike other forms of hunting, the hounds are not followed by humans.

===Clean boot hunting===

Clean boot hunting uses packs of bloodhounds to follow the natural trail of a human&#x27;s scent.

== Animals of the hunt ==

=== Hounds and other dogs ===
Fox hunting is usually undertaken with a pack of scent hounds, and, in most cases, these are specially bred &quot;foxhounds&quot;.
These dogs are trained to pursue the fox based on its scent. The two main types of foxhound are the English Foxhound and the American Foxhound. It is possible to use a sight hound such as a Greyhound or lurcher to pursue foxes, though this practice is not common in organised hunting, and these dogs are more often used for coursing animals such as hares. There is also one pack of beagles in Virginia that hunt foxes. They are unique in that they are the only hunting beagle pack in the US to be followed on horseback. English Foxhounds are also used for hunting mink.

Hunts may also use terriers to flush or kill foxes that are hiding underground, as they are small enough to pursue the fox through narrow earth passages. This is not practised in the United States, as once the fox has gone to ground and is accounted for by the hounds, it is left alone.

=== Horses ===
The horses, called &quot;field hunters&quot; or &quot;hunters,&quot; ridden by members of the field, are a prominent feature of many hunts, although others are conducted on foot (and those hunts with a field of mounted riders will also have foot followers). Horses on hunts can range from specially bred and trained field hunters to casual hunt attendees riding a wide variety of horse and pony types. Draft and Thoroughbred crosses are commonly used as hunters, although purebred Thoroughbreds and horses of many different breeds are also used.

Some hunts with unique territories favour certain traits in field hunters; for example, when hunting coyote in the western US, a faster horse with more stamina is required to keep up, as coyotes are faster than foxes and inhabit larger territories. Hunters must be well-mannered, have the athletic ability to clear large obstacles such as wide ditches, tall fences, and rock walls, and have the stamina to keep up with the hounds. In English foxhunting, the horses are often a cross of half or a quarter Irish Draught and the remainder English thoroughbred.

Dependent on terrain, and to accommodate different levels of ability, hunts generally have alternative routes that do not involve jumping. The field may be divided into two groups, with one group, the &quot;First Field,&quot; that takes a more direct but demanding route that involves jumps over obstacles while another group, the &quot;Second Field&quot; (also called &quot;Hilltoppers&quot; or &quot;Gaters&quot;), takes longer but less challenging routes that utilise gates or other types of access on the flat.

=== Birds of prey ===

In Great Britain, since the introduction of the hunting ban, a number of hunts have employed falconers to bring birds of prey to the hunt, due to the exemption in the Hunting Act for falconry. Many experts, such as the Hawk Board, deny that any bird of prey can reasonably be used in the British countryside to kill a fox which has been flushed by (and is being chased by) a pack of hounds.

== Procedure ==
=== Main hunting season ===

The main hunting season usually begins in early November, in the northern hemisphere, and in May in the southern hemisphere.

A hunt begins when the hounds are put, or &quot;cast&quot;, into a patch of woods or brush where foxes are known to lay up during daylight hours; known as a &quot;covert&quot; (pronounced &quot;cover&quot;). If the pack manages to pick up the scent of a fox, they will track it for as long as they are able. Scenting can be affected by temperature, humidity, and other factors. If the hounds lose the scent, a &quot;check&quot; occurs.
The hounds pursue the trail of the fox and the riders follow, by the most direct route possible. This may involve very athletic skill on the part of horse and rider, and fox hunting has given birth to some traditional equestrian sports including steeplechase and point-to-point racing.

The hunt continues until either the fox &quot;goes to ground&quot; (evades the hounds and takes refuge in a burrow or den) or is overtaken and usually killed by the hounds.

Social rituals are important to hunts, although many have fallen into disuse. One of the most notable was the act of &quot;blooding&quot;. In this ceremony, the master or huntsman would smear the blood of the fox onto the cheeks or forehead of a newly initiated hunt-follower, often a young child. Another practice of some hunts was to cut off the fox&#x27;s tail (&quot;brush&quot;), the feet (&quot;pads&quot;) and the head (&quot;mask&quot;) as trophies, with the carcass then thrown to the hounds. Both of these practices were widely abandoned during the nineteenth century, although isolated cases may still have occurred to the modern day.

== Cubbing ==
In the autumn of each year, hunts accustom the young hounds, which by now are full-size, but not yet sexually mature, to hunt and kill foxes through the practice of &quot;cubbing&quot; (also called &quot;cub hunting&quot;, &quot;autumn hunting&quot; and &quot;entering&quot;). Cubbing also aims to teach hounds to restrict their hunting to foxes, so that they do not hunt other species such as deer or hares.

The activity sometimes incorporates the practice of &quot;holding up&quot;; where hunt supporters, riders and foot followers surround a covert and drive back foxes attempting to escape, before then &quot;drawing&quot; the covert with the young hounds and some more experienced hounds, allowing them to find and kill foxes within the surrounded covert. A young hound is considered to be &quot;entered&quot; into the pack once they have successfully joined in a hunt of this fashion. Since one of the objectives of fox hunting is to control fox populations, cubbing is a highly effective way of reaching this as more than one fox could be killed in a covert. Cubbing is also an effective way of dispersing fox populations. Young hounds which do not show sufficient aptitude may be killed by their owners or drafted to other packs, including minkhound packs.

The Burns Inquiry, established in 1999, reported that an estimated 10,000 fox cubs were killed annually during the cub-hunting season in Great Britain. Cub hunting is now illegal in Great Britain,
although anti-hunt associations maintain that the practice continues.

== People ==
===Hunt staff and officials===

As a social ritual, participants in a fox hunt fill specific roles, the most prominent of which is the master, who often number more than one and then are called masters or joint masters. These individuals typically take much of the financial responsibility for the overall management of the sporting activities of the hunt, along with the care and breeding of the hunt&#x27;s foxhounds as well as control and direction of its paid staff.

* The Master of Foxhounds (who use the post-nominal (and may also be called) MFH) or Joint Master of Foxhounds operates the sporting activities of the hunt, maintains the kennels, works with (and sometimes is) the huntsman, and spends the money raised by the hunt club. (Often the master or joint masters are the largest of financial contributors to the hunt.) The master will have the final say over all matters in the field.
* Honorary secretaries are volunteers (usually one or two) who look after the administration of the hunt.
* The Treasurer collects the cap (money) from guest riders and manages the hunt&#x27;s finances.
* A kennelman looks after hounds in kennels, assuring that all tasks are completed when pack and staff return from hunting.
* The huntsman, who may be a professional, is responsible for directing the hounds. The Huntsman usually carries a horn to communicate to the hounds, followers and whippers in. Some huntsmen also fill the role of kennelman (and are therefore known as the kennel huntsman). In some hunts the master is also the huntsman.
* Whippers-in (or &quot;Whips&quot;) are assistants to the huntsman. Their main job is to keep the pack all together, especially to prevent the hounds from straying or &#x27;riotting&#x27;, which term refers to the hunting of animals other than the hunted fox or trail line. To help them to control the pack, they carry hunting whips (and in the United States they sometimes also carry .22 revolvers loaded with snake shot or blanks.) The role of &quot;whipper-in&quot; in hunts has inspired parliamentary systems (including the Westminster System and the US Congress) to use &quot;whip&quot; for a member who enforces party discipline and ensures the attendance of other members at important votes.
*Terrier man— Carries out fox control. Most hunts where the object is to kill the fox will employ a terrier man, whose job it is to control the terriers which may be used underground to corner or flush the fox. Often voluntary terrier men will follow the hunt as well. In the UK and Ireland, they often ride quadbikes with their terriers in boxes on their bikes.

In addition to members of the hunt staff, a committee may run the &quot;Hunt Supporters Club&quot; to organise fundraising and social events and in the United States many hunts are incorporated and have parallel lines of leadership.

The United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States each have a &quot;Masters of Foxhounds Association&quot; (MFHA) which consists of current and past masters of foxhounds. This is the governing body for all foxhound packs and deals with disputes about boundaries between hunts, as well as regulating the activity.

=== Attire ===
Mounted hunt followers typically wear traditional hunting attire. A prominent feature of hunts operating during the formal hunt season (usually November to March in the northern hemisphere) is hunt members wearing &#x27;colours&#x27;. This attire usually consists of the traditional red coats worn by huntsmen, masters, former masters, whippers-in (regardless of sex), other hunt staff members and male members who have been invited by masters to wear colours and hunt buttons as a mark of appreciation for their involvement in the organization and running of the hunt.

Since the Hunting Act in England and Wales, only Masters and Hunt Servants tend to wear red coats or the hunt livery whilst out hunting. Gentleman subscribers tend to wear black coats, with or without hunt buttons. In some countries, women generally wear coloured collars on their black or navy coats. These help them stand out from the rest of the field.
The traditional red coats are often misleadingly called &quot;pinks&quot;. Various theories about the derivation of this term have been given, ranging from the colour of a weathered scarlet coat to the name of a purportedly famous tailor.

Some hunts, including most harrier and beagle packs, wear green rather than red jackets, and some hunts wear other colours such as mustard. The colour of breeches vary from hunt to hunt and are generally of one colour, though two or three colours throughout the year may be permitted. Riding boots are generally English dress boots (no laces). For the men they are black with brown leather tops (called tan tops), and for the women, black with a patent black leather top of similar proportion to the men. Additionally, the number of buttons is significant. The Master wears a scarlet coat with four brass buttons while the huntsman and other professional staff wear five. Amateur whippers-in also wear four buttons.

Another differentiation in dress between the amateur and professional staff is found in the ribbons at the back of the hunt cap. The professional staff wear their hat ribbons down, while amateur staff and members of the field wear their ribbons up.

Those members not entitled to wear colours, dress in a black hunt coat and unadorned black buttons for both men and women, generally with pale breeches. Boots are all English dress boots and have no other distinctive look. Some hunts also further restrict the wear of formal attire to weekends and holidays and wear ratcatcher (tweed jacket and tan breeches), at all other times.

Other members of the mounted field follow strict rules of clothing etiquette. For example, for some hunts, those under eighteen (or sixteen in some cases) will wear ratcatcher all season. Those over eighteen (or in the case of some hunts, all followers regardless of age) will wear ratcatcher during autumn hunting from late August until the Opening Meet, normally around 1 November. From the Opening Meet they will switch to formal hunting attire where entitled members will wear scarlet and the rest black or navy.

The highest honour is to be awarded the hunt button by the Hunt Master. This sometimes means one can then wear scarlet if male, or the hunt collar if female (colour varies from hunt to hunt) and buttons with the hunt crest on them. For non-mounted packs or non-mounted members where formal hunt uniform is not worn, the buttons are sometimes worn on a waistcoat. All members of the mounted field should carry a hunting whip (it should not be called a crop). These have a horn handle at the top and a long leather lash (2–3 yards) ending in a piece of coloured cord. Generally all hunting whips are brown, except those of Hunt Servants, whose whips are white.

== Controversy ==
The nature of fox hunting, including the killing of the quarry animal, the pursuit&#x27;s strong associations with tradition and social class, and its practice for sport have made it a source of great controversy within the United Kingdom. In December 1999, the then Home Secretary, Jack Straw MP, announced the establishment of a Government inquiry (the Burns Inquiry) into hunting with dogs, to be chaired by the retired senior civil servant Lord Burns. The inquiry was to examine the practical aspects of different types of hunting with dogs and its impact, how any ban might be implemented and the consequences of any such ban.

Amongst its findings, the Burns Inquiry committee analysed opposition to hunting in the UK and reported that:
There are those who have a moral objection to hunting and who are fundamentally opposed to the idea of people gaining pleasure from what they regard as the causing of unnecessary suffering. There are also those who perceive hunting as representing a divisive social class system. Others, as we note below, resent the hunt trespassing on their land, especially when they have been told they are not welcome. They worry about the welfare of the pets and animals and the difficulty of moving around the roads where they live on hunt days. Finally there are those who are concerned about damage to the countryside and other animals, particularly badgers and otters.

In a later debate in the House of Lords, the inquiry chairman, Lord Burns, also stated that &quot;Naturally, people ask whether we were implying that hunting is cruel... The short answer to that question is no. There was not sufficient verifiable evidence or data safely to reach views about cruelty. It is a complex area.&quot;

Anti-hunting activists who choose to take action in opposing fox hunting can do so through lawful means, such as campaigning for fox hunting legislation and monitoring hunts for cruelty. Some use unlawful means. Main anti-hunting campaign organisations include the RSPCA and the League Against Cruel Sports. In 2001, the RSPCA took high court action to prevent pro-hunt activists joining in large numbers to change the society&#x27;s policy in opposing hunting.

Outside of campaigning, some activists choose to engage in direct intervention such as sabotage of the hunt. Hunt sabotage is unlawful in a majority of the United States, and some tactics used in it (such as trespass and criminal damage) are offences there and in other countries.

Fox hunting with hounds has been happening in Europe since at least the sixteenth century, and strong traditions have built up around the activity, as have related businesses, rural activities, and hierarchies. For this reason, there are large numbers of people who support fox hunting and this can be for a variety of reasons.

=== Pest control ===
The fox is referred to as vermin in some countries. Some farmers fear the loss of their smaller livestock, while others consider them an ally in controlling rabbits, voles, and other rodents, which eat crops. A key reason for dislike of the fox by pastoral farmers is their tendency to commit acts of surplus killing toward animals such as chickens, since having killed many they eat only one. Some anti-hunt campaigners maintain that provided it is not disturbed, the fox will remove all of the chickens it kills and conceal them in a safer place.

Opponents of fox hunting claim that the activity is not necessary for fox control, arguing that the fox is not a pest species despite its classification and that hunting does not and cannot make a real difference to fox populations. They compare the number of foxes killed in the hunt to the many more killed on the roads. They also argue that wildlife management goals of the hunt can be met more effectively by other methods such as &quot;lamping&quot; (dazzling a fox with a bright light, then shooting by a competent shooter using an appropriate weapon and load).

There is scientific evidence that fox hunting has no effect on fox populations, at least in Britain, thereby calling into question the idea it is a successful method of culling. In 2001 there was a 1-year nationwide ban on fox-hunting because of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. It was found this ban on hunting had no measurable impact on fox numbers in randomly selected areas. Prior to the fox hunting ban in the UK, hounds contributed to the deaths of 6.3% of the 400,000 foxes killed annually.

The hunts claim to provide and maintain a good habitat for foxes and other game, and, in the US, have fostered conservation legislation and put land into conservation easements. Anti-hunting campaigners cite the widespread existence of artificial earths and the historic practice by hunts of introducing foxes, as indicating that hunts do not believe foxes to be pests.

It is also argued that hunting with dogs has the advantage of weeding out old, sick, and weak animals because the strongest and healthiest foxes are those most likely to escape. Therefore, unlike other methods of controlling the fox population, it is argued that hunting with dogs resembles natural selection. The counter-argument is given that hunting cannot kill old foxes because foxes have a natural death rate of 65% per annum.

In Australia, where foxes have played a major role in the decline in the number of species of wild animals, the Government&#x27;s Department of the Environment and Heritage concluded that &quot;hunting does not seem to have had a significant or lasting impact on fox numbers.&quot; Instead, control of foxes relies heavily on shooting, poisoning and fencing.

=== Economics ===
As well as the economic defence of fox hunting that it is necessary to control the population of foxes, lest they cause economic cost to the farmers, it is also argued that fox hunting is a significant economic activity in its own right, providing recreation and jobs for those involved in the hunt and supporting it. The Burns Inquiry identified that between 6,000 and 8,000 full-time jobs depend on hunting in the UK, of which about 700 result from direct hunt employment and 1,500 to 3,000 result from direct employment on hunting-related activities.

Since the ban in the UK, there has been no evidence of significant job losses, and hunts have continued to operate along limited lines, either trail hunting, or claiming to use exemptions in the legislation.

===Animal welfare and animal rights===
Many animal welfare groups, campaigners and activists believe that fox hunting is unfair and cruel to animals. They argue that the chase itself causes fear and distress and that the fox is not always killed instantly as is claimed. Animal rights campaigners also object to hunting (including fox hunting), on the grounds that animals should enjoy some basic rights (such as the right to freedom from exploitation and the right to life).

In the United States and Canada, pursuing quarry for the purpose of killing is strictly forbidden by the Masters of Foxhounds Association. According to article 2 of the organisation&#x27;s code:
The sport of fox hunting as it is practised in North America places emphasis on the chase and not the kill. It is inevitable, however, that hounds will at times catch their game. Death is instantaneous. A pack of hounds will account for their quarry by running it to ground, treeing it, or bringing it to bay in some fashion. The Masters of Foxhounds Association has laid down detailed rules to govern the behaviour of Masters of Foxhounds and their packs of hounds.
There are times when a fox that is injured or sick is caught by the pursuing hounds, but hunts say that the occurrence of an actual kill of this is exceptionally rare.

Supporters of hunting maintain that when foxes or other prey (such as coyotes in the western USA) are hunted, the quarry are either killed relatively quickly (instantly or in a matter of seconds) or escapes uninjured. Similarly, they say that the animal rarely endures hours of torment and pursuit by hounds, and research by Oxford University shows that the fox is normally killed after an average of 17 minutes of chase. They further argue that, while hunting with hounds may cause suffering, controlling fox numbers by other means is even more cruel. Depending on the skill of the shooter, the type of firearm used, the availability of good shooting positions and luck, shooting foxes can cause either an instant kill, or lengthy periods of agony for wounded animals which can die of the trauma within hours, or of secondary infection over a period of days or weeks. Research from wildlife hospitals, however, indicates that it is not uncommon for foxes with minor shot wounds to survive.  Hunt supporters further say that it is a matter of humanity to kill foxes rather than allow them to suffer malnourishment and mange.

Other methods include the use of snares, trapping and poisoning, all of which also cause considerable distress to the animals concerned, and may affect other species. This was considered in the Burns Inquiry (paras 6.60–11), whose tentative conclusion was that lamping using rifles fitted with telescopic sights, if carried out properly and in appropriate circumstances, had fewer adverse welfare implications than hunting. The committee believed that lamping was not possible without vehicular access, and hence said that the welfare of foxes in upland areas could be affected adversely by a ban on hunting with hounds, unless dogs could be used to flush foxes from cover (as is permitted in the Hunting Act 2004).

Some opponents of hunting criticise the fact that the animal suffering in fox hunting takes place for sport, citing either that this makes such suffering unnecessary and therefore cruel, or else that killing or causing suffering for sport is immoral. The Court of Appeal, in considering the British Hunting Act, determined that the legislative aim of the Hunting Act was &quot;a composite one of preventing or reducing unnecessary suffering to wild mammals, overlaid by a moral viewpoint that causing suffering to animals for sport is unethical.&quot;

Anti-hunting campaigners also criticised UK hunts of which the Burns Inquiry estimated that foxhound packs put down around 3,000 hounds, and the hare hunts killed around 900 hounds per year, in each case after the hounds&#x27; working life had come to an end.

In June 2016, three people associated with the South Herefordshire Hunt (UK) were arrested on suspicion of causing suffering to animals in response to claims that live fox cubs were used to train hounds to hunt and kill. The organisation Hunt Investigation Team supported by the League Against Cruel Sports, gained video footage of an individual carrying a fox cub into a large kennel where the hounds can clearly be heard baying. A dead fox was later found in a rubbish bin. The individuals arrested were suspended from Hunt membership. In August, two more people were arrested in connection with the investigation.

=== Civil liberties ===
It is argued by some hunt supporters that no law should curtail the right of a person to do as they wish, so long as it does not harm others. Philosopher Roger Scruton has said, &quot;To criminalise this activity would be to introduce legislation as illiberal as the laws which once deprived Jews and Catholics of political rights, or the laws which outlawed homosexuality&quot;. In contrast, liberal philosopher, John Stuart Mill wrote, &quot;The reasons for legal intervention in favour of children apply not less strongly to the case of those unfortunate slaves and victims of the most brutal parts of mankind—the lower animals.&quot; The UK&#x27;s most senior court, the House of Lords, has decided that a ban on hunting, in the form of the Hunting Act 2004, does not contravene the European Convention on Human Rights, as did the European Court of Human Rights.

=== Trespass ===
In its submission to the Burns Inquiry, the League Against Cruel Sports presented evidence of over 1,000 cases of trespass by hunts. These included trespass on railway lines and into private gardens. Trespass can occur as the hounds cannot recognise human-created boundaries they are not allowed to cross, and may therefore follow their quarry wherever it goes unless successfully called off. However, in the United Kingdom, trespass is a largely civil matter when performed accidentally.

Nonetheless, in the UK, the criminal offence of &#x27;aggravated trespass&#x27; was introduced in 1994 specifically to address the problems caused to fox hunts and other field sports by hunt saboteurs. Hunt saboteurs trespass on private land to monitor or disrupt the hunt, as this is where the hunting activity takes place. For this reason, the hunt saboteur &quot;tactics manual&quot; presents detailed information on legal issues affecting this activity, especially the Criminal Justice Act. Some hunt monitors also choose to trespass whilst they observe the hunts in progress.

The construction of the law means that hunt saboteurs&#x27; behaviour may result in charges of criminal aggravated trespass, rather than the less severe offence of civil trespass. Since the introduction of legislation to restrict hunting with hounds, there has been a level of confusion over the legal status of hunt monitors or saboteurs when trespassing, as if they disrupt the hunt whilst it is not committing an illegal act (as all the hunts claim to be hunting within the law) then they commit an offence; however, if the hunt was conducting an illegal act then the criminal offence of trespass may not have been committed.

=== Social life and class issues in Britain ===

In Britain, and especially in England and Wales, supporters of fox hunting regard it as a distinctive part of British culture generally, the basis of traditional crafts and a key part of social life in rural areas, an activity and spectacle enjoyed not only by the riders but also by others such as the &quot;unmounted pack&quot; which may follow along on foot, bicycle or 4x4 vehicles. They see the social aspects of hunting as reflecting the demographics of the area; the Home Counties packs, for example, are very different from those in North Wales and Cumbria, where the hunts are very much the activity of farmers and the working class. The Banwen Miners Hunt is such a working class club, founded in a small Welsh mining village, although its membership now is by no means limited to miners, with a more &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; make-up.

Oscar Wilde, in his play &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; (1893), once famously described &quot;the English country gentleman galloping after a fox&quot; as &quot;the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.&quot; Even before the time of Wilde, much of the criticism of fox hunting was couched in terms of social class. The argument was that while more &quot;working class&quot; blood sports such as cock fighting and badger baiting were long ago outlawed, fox hunting persists, although this argument can be countered with the fact that hare coursing, a more &quot;working-class&quot; sport, was outlawed at the same time as fox hunting with hounds in England and Wales. The philosopher Roger Scruton has said that the analogy with cockfighting and badger baiting is unfair, because these sports were more cruel and did not involve any element of pest control.

A series of &quot;Mr. Briggs&quot; cartoons by John Leech appeared in the magazine &quot;Punch&quot; during the 1850s which illustrated class issues. More recently the British anarchist group Class War has argued explicitly for disruption of fox hunts on class warfare grounds and even published a book &quot;The Rich at Play&quot; examining the subject. Other groups with similar aims, such as &quot;Revolutions per minute&quot; have also published papers which disparage fox hunting on the basis of the social class of its participants.

Opinion polls in the United Kingdom have shown that the population is equally divided as to whether or not the views of hunt objectors are based primarily on class grounds. Some people have pointed to evidence of class bias in the voting patterns in the House of Commons during the voting on the hunting bill between 2000 and 2001, with traditionally working-class Labour members voting the legislation through against the votes of normally middle- and upper-class Conservative members.

<text>In mathematics, a pseudometric space is a generalization of a metric space in which the distance between two distinct points can be zero. Pseudometric spaces were introduced by Đuro Kurepa in 1934. In the same way as every normed space is a metric space, every seminormed space is a pseudometric space. Because of this analogy, the term semimetric space (which has a different meaning in topology) is sometimes used as a synonym, especially in functional analysis.

When a topology is generated using a family of pseudometrics, the space is called a gauge space.

==Definition==

A pseudometric space formula_1 is a set formula_2 together with a non-negative real-valued function formula_3 called a , such that for every formula_4

#formula_5
#&quot;Symmetry&quot;: formula_6
#&quot;Subadditivity&quot;/&quot;Triangle inequality&quot;: formula_7
Unlike a metric space, points in a pseudometric space need not be distinguishable; that is, one may have formula_8 for distinct values formula_9

==Examples==

Any metric space is a pseudometric space. 
Pseudometrics arise naturally in functional analysis. Consider the space formula_10 of real-valued functions formula_11 together with a special point formula_12 This point then induces a pseudometric on the space of functions, given by formula_13 for formula_14

A seminorm formula_15 induces the pseudometric formula_16. This is a convex function of an affine function of formula_17 (in particular, a translation), and therefore convex in formula_17. (Likewise for formula_19.)

Conversely, a homogeneous, translation-invariant pseudometric induces a seminorm.

Pseudometrics also arise in the theory of hyperbolic complex manifolds: see Kobayashi metric. 

Every measure space formula_20 can be viewed as a complete pseudometric space by defining formula_21 for all formula_22 where the triangle denotes symmetric difference.

If formula_23 is a function and &quot;d&quot;2 is a pseudometric on &quot;X&quot;2, then formula_24 gives a pseudometric on &quot;X&quot;1. If &quot;d&quot;2 is a metric and &quot;f&quot; is injective, then &quot;d&quot;1 is a metric.

==Topology==

The is the topology generated by the open balls
formula_25
which form a basis for the topology. A topological space is said to be a if the space can be given a pseudometric such that the pseudometric topology coincides with the given topology on the space.

The difference between pseudometrics and metrics is entirely topological. That is, a pseudometric is a metric if and only if the topology it generates is T0 (that is, distinct points are topologically distinguishable).

The definitions of Cauchy sequences and metric completion for metric spaces carry over to pseudometric spaces unchanged.

==Metric identification==

The vanishing of the pseudometric induces an equivalence relation, called the metric identification, that converts the pseudometric space into a full-fledged metric space. This is done by defining formula_26 if formula_27. Let formula_28 be the quotient space of formula_2 by this equivalence relation and define
formula_30
This is well defined because for any formula_31 we have that formula_32 and so formula_33 and vice versa. Then formula_34 is a metric on formula_35 and formula_36 is a well-defined metric space, called the metric space induced by the pseudometric space formula_37.

The metric identification preserves the induced topologies. That is, a subset formula_38 is open (or closed) in formula_37 if and only if formula_40 is open (or closed) in formula_41 and formula_42 is saturated. The topological identification is the Kolmogorov quotient.

An example of this construction is the completion of a metric space by its Cauchy sequences.

<text>The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 are two Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which form part of the constitution of the United Kingdom. Section 2(2) of the Parliament Act 1949 provides that the two Acts are to be construed as one.

The Parliament Act 1911 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5. c. 13) asserted the supremacy of the House of Commons by limiting the legislation-blocking powers of the House of Lords (the &quot;suspensory veto&quot;). Provided the provisions of the Act are met, legislation can be passed without the approval of the House of Lords. Additionally, the 1911 Act amended the Septennial Act 1716 to reduce the maximum life of a Parliament from seven years to five years. The Parliament Act 1911 was amended by the Parliament Act 1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6. c. 103), which further limited the power of the Lords by reducing the time that they could delay bills, from two years to one.

The Parliament Acts have been used to pass legislation against the wishes of the House of Lords on seven occasions since 1911, including the passing of the Parliament Act 1949. Some constitutional lawyers had questioned the validity of the 1949 Act. These doubts were rejected in 2005 when members of the Countryside Alliance unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the Hunting Act 2004, which had been passed under the auspices of the Act. In October 2005, the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords dismissed the Alliance&#x27;s appeal against this decision, with an unusually large panel of nine Law Lords (out of then-existing twelve) holding that the 1949 Act was a valid Act of Parliament.

==Parliament Act 1911==
===Background===
The 1911 Act was a reaction to the clash between the Liberal government and the House of Lords, culminating in the so-called &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot; of 1909. In this Budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George proposed the introduction of a land tax based on the ideas of the American tax reformer Henry George. This new tax would have had a major effect on large landowners, and was opposed by the Conservative opposition, many of whom were large landowners themselves. The Conservatives believed that money should be raised through the introduction of tariffs on imports, which they claimed would help British industry. Contrary to British constitutional convention, the Conservatives used their large majority in the Lords to vote down the Budget. The Liberals made reducing the power of the Lords an important issue of the January 1910 general election.

The Liberals returned in a hung parliament after the election: their call for action against the Lords had energised believers in hereditary principle to vote for the Conservatives, but had failed to generate much interest with the rest of the voting public. The Liberals formed a minority government with the support of the Labour and Irish nationalist MPs. The Lords subsequently accepted the Budget. However, as a result of the dispute over the Budget, the new government introduced resolutions (that would later form the Parliament Bill) to limit the power of the Lords. The Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, asked King Edward VII to create sufficient new Liberal peers to pass the Bill if the Lords rejected it. The King said he would not be willing to do so unless Asquith obtained a clear mandate for such sweeping change by winning a second general election.

The Lords voted this 1910 Bill down. Edward VII had died in May 1910, but his son George V agreed to grant Asquith a second general election in December 1910 (this also resulted in a minority government), and at the time he agreed that, if necessary, he would create hundreds of new Liberal peers to neutralise the Conservative majority in the Lords. The Conservative Lords then backed down, and on 10 August 1911, the House of Lords passed the Parliament Act by a narrow 131–114 vote, with the support of some two dozen Conservative peers and eleven of thirteen Lords Spiritual.

The Parliament Act was intended as a temporary measure. The preamble states:

One of the reasons for the Irish Parliamentary Party MPs&#x27; support for the Parliament Act, and the bitterness of the Unionist resistance, was that the loss of the Lords&#x27; veto would make possible Irish Home Rule (i.e. a devolved legislature). The previous Liberal government&#x27;s attempt to initiate Irish Home Rule had been vetoed by the House of Lords in 1893: at the time of his retirement in 1894, William Ewart Gladstone had not attracted sufficient support from his colleagues for a battle with the House of Lords. The Parliament Act resulted in the eventual enactment of the Irish Home Rule Government of Ireland Act 1914. 

===Provisions===
The Act abolished any power of the House of Lords to veto any public Bill introduced in the House of Commons other than a bill containing any provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years or a Bill for confirming a provisional order. The Act does not affect Bills introduced in the House of Lords, private bills, or delegated legislation.

The effect of the Act is that the House of Lords can delay those bills that it could formerly veto. If they have been sent up to the House of Lords at least one month before the end of the session, money bills can be delayed for up to one month after being sent up, and other bills can be delayed for up to one year after being sent up. The period for which bills other than money bills could be delayed was originally two years. The Speaker was given the power to certify which bills are classified as money bills.

====Section 1: Powers of House of Lords as to money bills====
Section 1(1) provides:

The word &quot;month&quot; means calendar month.

Section 1(2) defines the expression &quot;money bill&quot;.

Section 1(3) provides:

====Section 2: Restriction of the powers of the House of Lords as to bills other than money bills====
This section originally provided that a bill to which this section applied which was rejected by the House of Lords would be presented for royal assent if it was passed by the Commons in three successive sessions, provided that two years had elapsed between second reading of the bill and its final passing in the Commons, notwithstanding that the Lords had not consented to the bill.

Section 1 of the Parliament Act 1949 provides that the Parliament Act 1911 has effect, and is deemed to have had effect from the beginning of the session in which the bill for the Parliament Act 1949 originated (save as regards that bill itself), as though sections 2(1) and (4), of Parliament Act 1911, read as they are printed in the following revised text of section 2 of that Act:

The words in square brackets are those substituted by section 1 of the Parliament Act 1949.

Before it was repealed in 1986, the proviso to section 1 of the Parliament Act 1949 read:

This proviso provided for the application of the Parliament Act 1911 to any bill rejected for the second time by the House of Lords before royal assent was given to the Parliament Act 1949 on 16 December 1949. In a report dated 27 September 1985, the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission said that this proviso had never been invoked and was, by that date, incapable of being invoked. They recommended that it be repealed.

====Section 6: Saving for existing rights and privileges of the House of Commons====
This section provides:

The prime minister, H. H. Asquith, said of the clause that became this section:

====Section 7: Duration of Parliament====
This section amended the Septennial Act 1715, reducing the maximum duration of any parliament from seven years to five.

The President of the Board of Education, Walter Runciman, said:

This section was repealed by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 for the United Kingdom on 15 September 2011, when parliament was given a fixed five-year term.

===Repeal in Ireland===
This Act was repealed for the Republic of Ireland on 16 May 1983 by section 1 of, and Part IV of the Schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1983 (No.11).

== Parliament Act 1949 ==


Immediately after the Second World War, the Labour government of Clement Attlee decided to amend the 1911 Act to reduce further the power of the Lords, as a result of their fears that their radical programme of nationalisation would be delayed by the Lords and hence would not be completed within the life of the parliament. The House of Lords did not interfere with nationalisations in 1945 or 1946, but it was feared that the proposed nationalisation of the iron and steel industry would be a bridge too far, so a bill was introduced in 1947 to reduce the time that the Lords could delay bills, from three sessions over two years to two sessions over one year. The Lords attempted to block this change. The Bill was reintroduced in 1948 and again in 1949, before the 1911 Act was finally used to force it through. Since the 1911 Act required a delay over three &quot;sessions&quot;, a special short &quot;session&quot; of parliament was introduced in 1948, with a King&#x27;s Speech on 14 September 1948, and prorogation on 25 October.

The amended Parliament Act was never used in the 1940s or 1950s, possibly because the mere threat of it was enough. The Salisbury convention that the Lords would not block government bills that were mentioned in the government&#x27;s manifesto dates from this time. Salisbury believed that since, in being returned to power, the Government was given a clear mandate for the policies proposed in its manifesto, it would be improper for the Lords to frustrate such legislation.

In every Bill presented to the Sovereign under sections 1 to 3 of the Parliament Act 1911 (as amended) the words of enactment are:

The usual enacting formula, used on other Acts, also refers to the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and omits the reference to the Parliament Acts.

==Use of the Parliament Acts==
The original form of the 1911 Act was used three times. These were:
# Government of Ireland Act 1914, which would have established a Home Rule government in Ireland; its implementation was blocked due to the First World War.
# Welsh Church Act 1914, under which the Welsh part of the Church of England was disestablished in 1920, becoming the Church in Wales.
# Parliament Act 1949, which amended the Parliament Act 1911 (discussed above).

The amended form of the 1911 Act has been used four times. These were:
# War Crimes Act 1991, which extended jurisdiction of UK courts to acts committed on behalf of Nazi Germany during the Second World War (the only time – to date – that the Parliament Acts have been used by a Conservative government).
# European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999, which changed the system of elections to the European Parliament from first past the post to a form of proportional representation.
# Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000, which equalised the age of consent for male homosexual sexual activities with that for heterosexual and female homosexual sexual activities at 16.
# Hunting Act 2004, which prohibited hare coursing and (subject to some exceptions) all hunting of wild mammals (particularly foxes) with dogs after early 2005.

The Welsh Church Act and the Government of Ireland Act were both given royal assent on the same day as the Suspensory Act 1914, which meant that neither would come into force until after the War.

After the Labour government came to power in 1997, there was repeated speculation that it would rely on the Parliament Acts to reverse a check from the Lords, but it did not prove necessary. The Parliament Acts were not required to enact, for example, the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No 2) Bill in 2000 (which originally proposed to give magistrates, not defendants, the choice of where an &quot;either way&quot; offence would be tried) because the government abandoned the bill after a wrecking amendment in the House of Lords. The Parliament Act was threatened to be used to get the Identity Cards Act 2006 passed through the Lords. This was backed up by a threat of an immediate introduction of a compulsory ID Card scheme. The Lords had no option but to accept a compromise of a delay in the introduction of the scheme. The Parliament Acts cannot be used to force through legislation that originated in the House of Lords, so they could not have been used to enact the Civil Partnerships Act 2004 or the Constitutional Reform Act 2005.

The first three measures for which the Act has been used since 1949 were not mentioned in manifestos, and hence in trying to veto them the Lords were not breaking the Salisbury convention. The Hunting Bill was mentioned in the Labour Party manifesto for the 2001 general election, so, depending upon how the convention is interpreted, the attempt to block it could be taken as a breach. However, as conventions are merely convention and not law, the House of Lords would not be taking illegal action if they were to act otherwise.

The Government of Ireland Act 1914 was repealed in entirety by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, the European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999 was repealed in entirety by the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 and most provisions of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 were repealed by the Sexual Offences Act 2003. While the War Crimes Act 1991 remains in force, to date only Anthony Sawoniuk has been convicted under it.

The threat of the Parliament Acts has been employed by several British governments to force the Lords to accept its legislation. In at least three cases, the procedure authorised by the Parliament Act 1911, or by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, was started, but the legislation was approved by the House of Lords as a result of the government making concessions. These were:
# Temperance (Scotland) Act 1913, which allowed the voters in a district to hold a poll to vote on whether their district went &quot;dry&quot; or remained &quot;wet&quot;.
# Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act 1976, which amended the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 to reverse changes made to that Act as it passed through Parliament.
# Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, which nationalised large parts of the UK aerospace and shipbuilding industries and established two corporations, British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders.

== Validity of the 1949 Act ==
Since the 1949 Act became law, doubts were raised by some legal academics as to whether the use of the 1911 Act to pass the 1949 Act, which amended the 1911 Act itself, was valid. Three main concerns were raised:
* The continued ability of the House of Lords to veto a bill to prolong the life of Parliament would not be entrenched if the 1911 Act could be used to amend itself first, removing this restriction.
* The 1949 Act could be considered to be secondary legislation, since it depended for its validity on another Act, the 1911 Act; and the principle that courts will respect an Act of Parliament without enquiring into its origins (an emanation of parliamentary sovereignty) would not apply.
* Under the 1911 Act, Parliament (that is, the Commons and the Lords acting together) delegated its ability to pass legislation to another body (the Commons alone). Following legal principles established when the United Kingdom granted legislative powers to assemblies in its colonies in the late 18th century, a subordinate legislative body cannot use the Act under which legislative power was delegated to it to expand its competence without an express power to do so in the enabling Act (see Declaratory Act).

To address these concerns, a Law Lord, Lord Donaldson of Lymington, presented a private member&#x27;s bill in House of Lords in the 2000–2001 session of Parliament (the Parliament Acts (Amendment) Bill), which would have had the effect of confirming the legitimacy of the 1949 Act, but prohibiting any further such uses of the Parliament Act to amend itself, or use of it to further modify or curtail the powers of the House of Lords. Another Parliament Acts (Amendment) Bill was introduced independently by Lord Renton of Mount Harry in the next session, but neither of these bills proceeded to a third reading.

The first legal challenge to the 1949 Act is believed to have been made during the first prosecution for war crimes under the War Crimes Act 1991, &quot;R v Serafinowicz&quot;, but (according to the Court of Appeal in &quot;R (Jackson) v Attorney General&quot;) no record of the legal arguments remains. Because a second defendant was successfully prosecuted under the War Crimes Act and sentenced to life imprisonment, and since the War Crimes Act was later amended by both two further acts (the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996), which were passed by both Houses and received royal assent, the validity of the War Crimes Act is not under question.

The 1949 Act and the validity of acts made under it were not questioned in court again until the Parliament Acts were used to pass the Hunting Act 2004. Early in 2005, the Countryside Alliance took a case to court to challenge the validity of the 1949 act. In the High Court, the wording of the 1911 act was held not to imply any entrenchment. Support for this conclusion can be drawn from the parliamentary debates on the 1911 act, in which an entrenchment clause was considered but rejected, the government clearly displaying the intention to be able to make such amendments if necessary. However, the 2005 decision was made on other grounds, so the question of whether the courts could refer to the 1949 Act&#x27;s parliamentary debates under the principle established in &quot;Pepper v Hart&quot; was not decided.

The High Court held that the 1949 Act was primary legislation, despite being unusual in that the courts can rule on whether the provisions of the 1911 Act are complied with. It was held that the 1911 Act clearly permits the procedures specified in the Parliament Acts to be used for &quot;any Public Bill&quot;, and this was sufficient to dispose of the argument that the 1911 Act could not be used to amend itself. The court took the view that the 1911 Act was a &#x27;remodelling&#x27; of the constitution rather than a delegation of power.

The subsequent Court of Appeal ruling agreed that the 1949 act itself was valid, but left open the question of whether the Commons could use the Parliament Act to make significant changes to the constitution (for example, repealing the Parliament Act&#x27;s provision prohibiting the act from being used to extend the lifespan of Parliament). The Court of Appeal refused to give the Countryside Alliance permission to appeal their decision to the House of Lords; however, a petition for permission to appeal was submitted directly to the Law Lords and granted in July 2005. Argument in the case was heard on 13 and 14 July 2005 by a large committee of nine Law Lords, rather than the normal five. In a unanimous decision, the Law Lords upheld the validity of 1949 Act.

== Future developments ==
After the &quot;first stage&quot; of reform of the House of Lords was implemented in the House of Lords Act 1999, the Wakeham Royal Commission on the proposal of a &quot;second stage&quot; of reform reported in January 2000. Subsequently, the government decided to take no action to change the legislative relationship between the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

In March 2006, it was reported that the then-Labour Government was considering removing the ability of the Lords to delay legislation that arises as a result of manifesto commitments (while the Lords still acted in accordance with a self-imposed restriction, the Salisbury Convention, which this legislation would have merely formalised), and reducing their ability to delay other legislation to a period of 60 days (although a compromise of 6 months has also been suggested). The Labour Government made no attempt to enact such changes before the 2010 general election, which Labour lost.

In May 2011, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced the Coalition Government&#x27;s plans to legislate for a mainly elected House of Lords. In the face of fierce opposition from the overwhelming majority of the Lords, he indicated that he would consider use of the Parliament Act. Ultimately this did not happen.

<text>Surface science is the study of physical and chemical phenomena that occur at the interface of two phases, including solid–liquid interfaces, solid–gas interfaces, solid–vacuum interfaces, and liquid–gas interfaces. It includes the fields of &quot;surface chemistry&quot; and &quot;surface physics&quot;. Some related practical applications are classed as surface engineering. The science encompasses concepts such as heterogeneous catalysis, semiconductor device fabrication, fuel cells, self-assembled monolayers, and adhesives. Surface science is closely related to interface and colloid science. Interfacial chemistry and physics are common subjects for both. The methods are different. In addition, interface and colloid science studies macroscopic phenomena that occur in heterogeneous systems due to peculiarities of interfaces.

==History==
The field of surface chemistry started with heterogeneous catalysis pioneered by Paul Sabatier on hydrogenation and Fritz Haber on the Haber process. Irving Langmuir was also one of the founders of this field, and the scientific journal on surface science, &quot;Langmuir&quot;, bears his name. The Langmuir adsorption equation is used to model monolayer adsorption where all surface adsorption sites have the same affinity for the adsorbing species and do not interact with each other. Gerhard Ertl in 1974 described for the first time the adsorption of hydrogen on a palladium surface using a novel technique called LEED. Similar studies with platinum, nickel, and iron followed. Most recent developments in surface sciences include the 2007 Nobel prize of Chemistry winner Gerhard Ertl&#x27;s advancements in surface chemistry, specifically
his investigation of the interaction between carbon monoxide molecules and platinum surfaces.

==Chemistry==
Surface chemistry can be roughly defined as the study of chemical reactions at interfaces. It is closely related to surface engineering, which aims at modifying the chemical composition of a surface by incorporation of selected elements or functional groups that produce various desired effects or improvements in the properties of the surface or interface. Surface science is of particular importance to the fields of heterogeneous catalysis, electrochemistry, and geochemistry.

===Catalysis===
The adhesion of gas or liquid molecules to the surface is known as adsorption. This can be due to either chemisorption or physisorption, and the strength of molecular adsorption to a catalyst surface is critically important to the catalyst&#x27;s performance (see Sabatier principle). However, it is difficult to study these phenomena in real catalyst particles, which have complex structures. Instead, well-defined single crystal surfaces of catalytically active materials such as platinum are often used as model catalysts. Multi-component materials systems are used to study interactions between catalytically active metal particles and supporting oxides; these are produced by growing ultra-thin films or particles on a single crystal surface.

Relationships between the composition, structure, and chemical behavior of these surfaces are studied using ultra-high vacuum techniques, including adsorption and temperature-programmed desorption of molecules, scanning tunneling microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and Auger electron spectroscopy. Results can be fed into chemical models or used toward the rational design of new catalysts. Reaction mechanisms can also be clarified due to the atomic-scale precision of surface science measurements.

===Electrochemistry===
Electrochemistry is the study of processes driven through an applied potential at a solid–liquid or liquid–liquid interface. The behavior of an electrode–electrolyte interface is affected by the distribution of ions in the liquid phase next to the interface forming the electrical double layer. Adsorption and desorption events can be studied at atomically flat single-crystal surfaces as a function of applied potential, time and solution conditions using spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy and surface X-ray scattering. These studies link traditional electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry to direct observations of interfacial processes.

===Geochemistry===
Geological phenomena such as iron cycling and soil contamination are controlled by the interfaces between minerals and their environment. The atomic-scale structure and chemical properties of mineral–solution interfaces are studied using &quot;in situ&quot; synchrotron X-ray techniques such as X-ray reflectivity, X-ray standing waves, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy as well as scanning probe microscopy. For example, studies of heavy metal or actinide adsorption onto mineral surfaces reveal molecular-scale details of adsorption, enabling more accurate predictions of how these contaminants travel through soils or disrupt natural dissolution–precipitation cycles.

==Physics==
Surface physics can be roughly defined as the study of physical interactions that occur at interfaces. It overlaps with surface chemistry. Some of the topics investigated in surface physics include friction, surface states, surface diffusion, surface reconstruction, surface phonons and plasmons, epitaxy, the emission and tunneling of electrons, spintronics, and the self-assembly of nanostructures on surfaces. Techniques to investigate processes at surfaces include surface X-ray scattering, scanning probe microscopy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

==Analysis techniques==
The study and analysis of surfaces involves both physical and chemical analysis techniques.

Several modern methods probe the topmost 1–10 nm of surfaces exposed to vacuum. These include angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), thermal desorption spectroscopy (TPD), ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS), secondary ion mass spectrometry, dual-polarization interferometry, and other surface analysis methods included in the list of materials analysis methods. Many of these techniques require vacuum as they rely on the detection of electrons or ions emitted from the surface under study. Moreover, in general ultra-high vacuum, in the range of 10−7 pascal pressure or better, it is necessary to reduce surface contamination by residual gas, by reducing the number of molecules reaching the sample over a given time period. At 0.1 mPa (10−6 torr) partial pressure of a contaminant and standard temperature, it only takes on the order of 1 second to cover a surface with a one-to-one monolayer of contaminant to surface atoms, so much lower pressures are needed for measurements. This is found by an order of magnitude estimate for the (number) specific surface area of materials and the impingement rate formula from the kinetic theory of gases.

Purely optical techniques can be used to study interfaces under a wide variety of conditions. Reflection-absorption infrared, dual polarisation interferometry, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and sum frequency generation spectroscopy can be used to probe solid–vacuum as well as solid–gas, solid–liquid, and liquid–gas surfaces. Multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance works in solid–gas, solid–liquid, liquid–gas surfaces and can detect even sub-nanometer layers. It probes the interaction kinetics as well as dynamic structural changes such as liposome collapse or swelling of layers in different pH. Dual-polarization interferometry is used to quantify the order and disruption in birefringent thin films. This has been used, for example, to study the formation of lipid bilayers and their interaction with membrane proteins.

Acoustic techniques, such as quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, is used for time-resolved measurements of solid–vacuum, solid–gas and solid–liquid interfaces. The method allows for analysis of molecule–surface interactions as well as structural changes and viscoelastic properties of the adlayer.  

X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques are also used to characterize surfaces and interfaces. While some of these measurements can be performed using laboratory X-ray sources, many require the high intensity and energy tunability of synchrotron radiation. X-ray crystal truncation rods (CTR) and X-ray standing wave (XSW) measurements probe changes in surface and adsorbate structures with sub-Ångström resolution. Surface-extended X-ray absorption fine structure (SEXAFS) measurements reveal the coordination structure and chemical state of adsorbates. Grazing-incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) yields the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles on surfaces. The crystal structure and texture of thin films can be investigated using grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD, GIXRD).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a standard tool for measuring the chemical states of surface species and for detecting the presence of surface contamination. Surface sensitivity is achieved by detecting photoelectrons with kinetic energies of about 10–1000 eV, which have corresponding inelastic mean free paths of only a few nanometers. This technique has been extended to operate at near-ambient pressures (ambient pressure XPS, AP-XPS) to probe more realistic gas–solid and liquid–solid interfaces. Performing XPS with hard X-rays at synchrotron light sources yields photoelectrons with kinetic energies of several keV (hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, HAXPES), enabling access to chemical information from buried interfaces.

Modern physical analysis methods include scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) and a family of methods descended from it, including atomic force microscopy (AFM). These microscopies have considerably increased the ability of surface scientists to measure the physical structure of many surfaces. For example, they make it possible to follow reactions at the solid–gas interface in real space, if those proceed on a time scale accessible by the instrument.

<text>Pedro Gutiérrez de Valdivia or Valdiva (; April 17, 1497 – December 25, 1553) was a Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; and the first royal governor of Chile. After serving with the Spanish army in Italy and Flanders, he was sent to South America in 1534, where he served as lieutenant under Francisco Pizarro in Peru, acting as his second in command.

In 1540, Valdivia led an expedition of 150 Spaniards into Chile, where he defeated a large force of indigenous warriors and founded Santiago in 1541. He extended Spanish rule south to the Biobío River in 1546, fought again in Peru (1546–1548), and returned to Chile as governor in 1549. He began to colonize Chile south of the Biobío and founded Concepción in 1550. He was captured and killed by Mapuche Indians during the Arauco War in 1553. The city of Valdivia in Chile is named after him.

==Early life as soldier in Europe and arrival in the Americas==
Pedro de Valdivia is believed to have been born in Villanueva de la Serena 
(some say Castuera) in Extremadura, Spain around 1500 (some sources put his date of birth as early as 1497 or as late as 1505) to an impoverished hidalgo family. In 1520 a civil war broke out in Castile, the Revolt of the Comuneros, and Valdivia joined the army of Spanish king Charles I. He later fought in Flanders in 1521 and Italy between 1522 and 1527, participating in the battle of Pavia as part of the troops of the Marquis of Pescara. In May 1527, Valdivia was involved in the sack of Rome as a member of Charles I&#x27;s mutinous mercenary army.

He traveled with Spanish forces to South America in 1535. He was assigned for a year to present-day Venezuela. He was moved to Peru in 1537.

There he took part on the side of Hernando Pizarro in his struggle against Diego de Almagro and fought in the battle of Las Salinas in 1538; Almagro was defeated and captured. Afterwards Valdivia accompanied Hernando and Gonzalo Pizarro to conquer both the province of Collao and las Charcas in High Peru (currently Bolivia). As compensation for his help in conquering these lands, he was awarded a silver mine and became a wealthy man.

Valdivia had married Marina Ortíz de Gaete in Spain. In Peru he became attached to Inés de Suárez, a Spanish widow who accompanied him to Chile as his mistress.

==Expedition to Chile==
After the failure of the expedition of Diego de Almagro in 1536, the lands to the south of Peru (then known as &quot;Nueva Toledo&quot;, extending from the 14° — close to modern day Pisco, Peru — to the 25° latitude — close to Taltal, Chile) had remained unexplored. Valdivia asked governor Francisco Pizarro for permission to complete the conquest of that territory. He got his permission but was appointed as Lieutenant Governor, rather than Governor as he had wanted.

The expedition was fraught with problems from the beginning. Valdivia had to sell the lands and the mine that had been assigned to him in order to finance the expedition. A shortage of soldiers and adventurers was also problematic; the men were not interested in conquering what they believed were extremely poor lands. While Valdivia was preparing the expedition, Pedro Sánchez de la Hoz arrived from Spain with a royal grant for the same territory. To avoid difficulties, Pizarro advised the two competitors to join their interests, and on December 28, 1539, they signed a contract of partnership.

The small expedition finally left Cuzco, Peru in January 1540, with Pizarro&#x27;s permission and Pedro Sancho de Hoz as partner. They carried a plethora of seeds for planting, a drove of swine and brood mares, and almost a thousand native warriors, but few Spaniards. Only one woman was among the travelers, Inés de Suárez, Valdivia&#x27;s mistress. En route more Spaniards joined the expedition, attracted by Valdivia&#x27;s fame as a brilliant leader. These conquistadores had formed part of the failed campaigns to the highlands of Bolivia; together around 150 Spaniards joined the expedition.

Valdivia resolved to avoid the road over the Andes, which had proved fatal to Almagro&#x27;s army, and set out resolutely through the Atacama Desert. On the way, Sancho de Hoz, seeking sole leadership, tried to murder Valdivia but failed. He was pardoned, but from then on had to accept subordinate status. The natives of the region were not pleased by the return of the Spaniards due to the maltreatment they had suffered under Almagro. With many promises, Valdivia was able to regain their trust. After a march of five months, and suffering great privations, the expedition arrived at the Copiapo valley. Valdivia officially took possession of the land in the name of the Spanish king.

Soon thereafter they continued south and in December 1540, eleven months after they left Cuzco, Valdivia and his expedition reached the valley of the Mapocho river, where they established the capital of the territory. The valley was extensive and well populated with natives. Its soil was fertile and there was abundant fresh water. Two high hills provided defensive positions. Soon after their arrival, Valdivia tried to convince the native inhabitants of his good intentions, sending out delegations bearing gifts for the caciques.

Finally on February 12, 1541, Valdivia officially founded the city of Santiago de la Nueva Extremadura (named after Saint James, &quot;Santiago&quot; in Spanish, and Valdivia&#x27;s home region of Extremadura, Spain). The ceremony was held at the foot of the &quot;Huelén&quot; hill (now known as &quot;Santa Lucia hill&quot;).

After arriving in Chile, Valdivia and his men worked to restore a positive relationship between the conquistadores and Indians, which had been greatly harmed by Almagro and his merciless ways. At first, Valdivia was successful in his efforts, but this peaceful coexistence did not last long. One of the first orders that Valdivia gave was to have a ship constructed at the mouth of the Aconcagua River to send to Peru for further supplies and to serve as a courier service. He then had to return in haste to Santiago to subdue a mutiny. The Spaniards&#x27; greed surfaced and overshadowed previous intentions when rumors of gold arose at the Marga Marga mines, in the vicinity of Valparaiso. The Spanish imposed slavery on the indigenous population to profit from the mines. 

==Colonization of Chile==

On learning of Francisco Pizarro&#x27;s murder in 1541, Valdivia had himself appointed governor of the territory by the council of the new city, and removed Chile from Peruvian control, acknowledging only the royal authority, an arrangement the Crown found acceptable. Secure now in his own domain, he pushed exploration southward and aided the development of the country by dividing the land among his ablest followers and parceling out the Indians in encomiendas. Chile possessed minerals, but Valdivia definitely subordinated mining to agriculture and stock raising. Still, the colony was not prosperous; gold was scarce and the Araucanians warlike.

===Destruction of Santiago===
After an apparent peaceful period the Natives began to resist the invaders. Valdivia marched against the tribes and defeated them at Cachapoal. While away, on September 11, 1541, local people led by Michimalonco attacked Santiago. The defense of the city was led by Pedro&#x27;s mistress Inés de Suárez. The Spaniards, desperate and willing to fight until death, were able to eventually push the Natives back; Valdivia and his troops made it back just in time to relieve the capital.

By the time the battle ended the entire town had been destroyed and burned to the ground, animals were killed and the fields and stores were decimated. Only a small amount of property was not destroyed, including a handful of seeds, two sows, one pig and a pair of chickens. Valdivia organized his men into groups to keep watch over the crops and protect the city against attack. For the next two years, there were men always saddled and armed, ready to fight in case the Natives posed a threat to Spanish authority.

This event meant a real setback for the conquest of the Chilean territory. The resistance of the Native people became stronger daily, and as the ship that he had constructed in Aconcagua was also destroyed by the natives, Valdivia sent in 1542 overland to Peru his lieutenant Alonso de Monroy with five followers to seek reinforcements, but, on account of the disturbance in that country in consequence of the defeat of El Mozo Almagro by Cristóbal Vaca de Castro, Monroy could not obtain much aid, and returned in September 1543, with only seventy horsemen, also sending by sea a vessel with provisions and ammunition to the port of Aconcagua.

==Expanding the colony==

In September 1543 new arms, clothes and other equipment arrived from Peru on the ship &quot;Santiaguillo&quot;; thanks to these new supplies, Valdivia was in the position to start the rebuilding of Santiago and to send an expedition, led by Juan Bohón, to explore and populate the northern region of Chile. This expedition founded La Serena halfway between Santiago and the northern Atacama Desert, in the valley of &quot;Coquimbo&quot;. Valparaíso, though used as a port by the Spaniards from the start, had no considerable population until much later.

In 1544 Valdivia sent a naval expedition consisting of the barks &quot;San Pedro&quot; and &quot;Santiaguillo&quot;, under the command of Juan Bautista Pastene, to reconnoiter the southwestern coast of South America, ordering him to reach the Strait of Magellan. The expedition set sail from Valparaíso and although Pastene did not reach this goal, he explored much of the coast. He entered the bay of San Pedro, and made landings at what are now known as Concepción and at Valdivia, which was later named in honor of the commander. Encountering severe storms further south, he then returned to Valparaiso.

In February 1546 Valdivia himself set out, with sixty horsemen plus native guides and porters, and crossed the Itata River. He arrived as far as the Bío-Bío River where he intended to further efforts at colonization by founding another town. However, Mapuche warriors defended their territory at the Battle of Quilacura. Realizing that it would be impossible to proceed in such hostile territory with so limited a force, Valdivia wisely elected to return to Santiago shortly thereafter, after finding a site for a new city at what is now Penco and would become the first site of Concepción. Still, Valdivia managed to subdue the country between Santiago and the Maule River.

===Return to Peru===

To secure additional aid and confirm his claims to the conquered territory, Valdivia returned in 1547 to Peru, leaving Francisco de Villagra as governor in his stead. There he tried to gather more resources and men to continue the conquest. When the Gonzalo Pizarro rebellion began in Peru, the insurgents attempted unsuccessfully to win Valdivia to their side. Nonetheless, early in 1548 Valdivia joined the royal army of Viceroy Pedro de la Gasca, and his military experience counted heavily in the victory of Xaquixahuana on April 9 of that year. In the battle, Valdivia met Francisco de Carvajal, who just like him had also fought in the Italian Wars, been at the Sack of Rome and helped to defeat Diego de Almagro.

Nonetheless, a discontented faction from Chile managed to have him tried in Lima, accused of tyranny, malfeasance of public funds and public immorality. One of the charges levelled against him was that he, being married, openly lived with Inés de Suárez &quot;...in the manner of man and wife and they sleep in one bed and they eat in one dish...&quot;. In exchange for being freed, and for his confirmation as Royal Governor, he agreed to relinquish her and to bring to Chile his wife, Marina Ortíz de Gaete, who only arrived after Valdivia&#x27;s death in 1554. He was also ordered to marry Inés off, which he did, upon his return to Chile in 1549, to one of his captains, Rodrigo de Quiroga. As recognition for his services Valdivia was finally appointed as &quot;adelantado&quot; and won the royal assent to his coveted title of Governor of Chile, returning to the settlement with his position and prestige considerably strengthened.

==Arauco War==

Between 1549 and 1553, after his return to Santiago, Valdivia again undertook the conquest of southern Chile, but faced heavy resistance from the indigenous population. Valdivia had a clash with the warlike Araucanians beyond the Bio-Bio River in 1550 in which he defeated them but by no means broke their will to resist, a will that grew stronger when the conquistador established settlements in their territory. In spite of the fierce resistance at the Battle of Penco, he founded Concepción on March 3, 1550. Later he founded the more southern villages of La Imperial, Valdivia, Angol and Villarrica, in 1551 and 1552.

===The uprising of 1553===

After a brief stay in Santiago, Valdivia returned to the south again in December 1552. To keep the connection open between Concepción and the southern settlements, Valdivia had a number of forts built in Cordillera de Nahuelbuta. He moved against the Araucanians again in 1553 and built a fort at Tucapel. By the advice of the cacique Colocolo, the Araucanians united their efforts choosing as toqui (general-in-chief) the famous warrior Caupolicán.

Valdivia had earlier captured and presumably made friends with Lautaro, an Araucanian youth who became his groom. Lautaro secretly remained true to his own people and rejoined them to show Caupolicán a means by which Valdivia could be defeated. Toward the end of 1553, the Araucanians under Lautaro revolted and they fell on the over-extended Spanish forces in the south. One of the first signs that a big rebellion was building was the attack on the fort at Tucapel, where they managed to destroy the fortress on December 2, 1553. Valdivia was at Concepcion when he received notice of this event, and, believing that he could easily subdue the uprising, he hurried southward, sallying forth with only 40 men to stamp out the rebellion.

Near the ruins of the fortress Valdivia gathered the remnant of the garrison. He was ambushed before arriving to his destination and the Battle of Tucapel would be Valdivia&#x27;s last. As each successive wave of attackers was wiped out or beaten off by the Spaniards, Lautaro sent another, until the entire Spanish company was massacred. The dreaded conquistador was captured still alive along with a priest by the Mapuche.

===Death===

There are many versions of how Valdivia&#x27;s killing took place. According to Jerónimo de Vivar, an author contemporary with the events, the execution of Valdivia was personally ordered by Caupolicán, who had him killed with a lance, and later his head, and those of two of his bravest companions, were put on display. Alonso de Góngora Marmolejo, another contemporary chronicler, writes that Valdivia offered as a ransom for his life the evacuation of all the Spanish settlements in the Mapuche lands and the gift of large herds of animals, but this offer was rejected. The Mapuche first cut off his forearms and roasted and ate them in front of him before killing him and his accompanying priest.

Alonso de Ercilla reports that Valdivia was killed with the blow of a club, and then with a knife a warrior cut open his breast and ripped out his heart, which was then handed to the toqui, who sucked its blood; the heart was passed around from one to another. A drinking cup was made from Valdivia&#x27;s skull. The warriors ran around the corpse, brandishing their lances and uttering cries, while the rest of the assembly stamped with their feet.

Another contemporary chronicler, Pedro Mariño de Lobera, wrote that Valdivia offered to evacuate the lands of the Mapuche but says he was shortly thereafter killed with a large club by a vengeful warrior named Pilmaiquen, who said that Valdivia could not be trusted to keep his word once freed. Lobera says that a common story in Chile at the time was that Valdivia had been killed by being forced to drink molten gold. According to an even later legend, Lautaro took Valdivia to the Mapuche camp and put him to death after three days of torture, extracting his beating heart and eating it with the Mapuche leaders. Probably all the stories about his death are apocryphal, since none of his party survived the battle, and the only known witnesses were indigenous fighters captured in subsequent battles.

==In literature==
Valdivia was an educated man and wielded the pen as well as the sword. In 1552 Valdivia despatched Captain Jerónimo de Alderete with a narrative of his exploits directly to the king Charles I. His twelve letters, addressed to the king and mostly preserved in the archives of the Indies, are models of a vigorous and fluent style, and of great historical interest.

His career and death are treated in the epic poem &quot;La Araucana&quot; by Alonso de Ercilla. He is also a major character in several historical novels, such as &quot;Inés y las raíces de la tierra&quot;, by María Correa Morande (1964); &quot;Ay Mamá Inés - Crónica Testimonial&quot; (1993) by Jorge Guzmán; &quot;Arauco: A Novel (2013)&quot;, by John Caviglia; and &quot;Inés of My Soul&quot; () by Isabel Allende (2006), &quot;They sure did something for the history of Chile&quot; by Alvaro Espinoza.

<doc id="68518" wikidata="Q899417" url="?curid=68518" title="Chemisorption">
<text>Chemisorption is a kind of adsorption which involves a chemical reaction between the surface and the adsorbate. New chemical bonds are generated at the adsorbent surface. Examples include macroscopic phenomena that can be very obvious, like corrosion, and subtler effects associated with heterogeneous catalysis, where the catalyst and reactants are in different phases. The strong interaction between the adsorbate and the substrate surface creates new types of electronic bonds.

In contrast with chemisorption is physisorption, which leaves the chemical species of the adsorbate and surface intact. It is conventionally accepted that the energetic threshold separating the binding energy of &quot;physisorption&quot; from that of &quot;chemisorption&quot; is about 0.5 eV per adsorbed species.

Due to specificity, the nature of chemisorption can greatly differ, depending on the chemical identity and the surface structural properties.
The bond between the adsorbate and adsorbent in chemisorption is either ionic or covalent.

==Uses==
An important example of chemisorption is in heterogeneous catalysis which involves molecules reacting with each other via the formation of chemisorbed intermediates. After the chemisorbed species combine (by forming bonds with each other) the product desorbs from the surface.
==Self-assembled monolayers==
Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are formed by chemisorbing reactive reagents with metal surfaces. A famous example involves thiols (RS-H) adsorbing onto the surface of gold. This process forms strong Au-SR bonds and releases H2. The densely packed SR groups protect the surface.

==Gas-surface chemisorption==

===Adsorption kinetics===
As an instance of adsorption, chemisorption follows the adsorption process. The first stage is for the adsorbate particle to come into contact with the surface. The particle needs to be trapped onto the surface by not possessing enough energy to leave the gas-surface potential well. If it elastically collides with the surface, then it would return to the bulk gas. If it loses enough momentum through an inelastic collision, then it &quot;sticks&quot; onto the surface, forming a precursor state bonded to the surface by weak forces, similar to physisorption. The particle diffuses on the surface until it finds a deep chemisorption potential well. Then it reacts with the surface or simply desorbs after enough energy and time.

The reaction with the surface is dependent on the chemical species involved. Applying the Gibbs energy equation for reactions:

:formula_1

General thermodynamics states that for spontaneous reactions at constant temperature and pressure, the change in free energy should be negative. Since a free particle is restrained to a surface, and unless the surface atom is highly mobile, entropy is lowered. This means that the enthalpy term must be negative, implying an exothermic reaction.

Physisorption is given as a Lennard-Jones potential and chemisorption is given as a Morse potential. There exists a point of crossover between the physisorption and chemisorption, meaning a point of transfer. It can occur above or below the zero-energy line (with a difference in the Morse potential, a), representing an activation energy requirement or lack of. Most simple gases on clean metal surfaces lack the activation energy requirement.
===Modeling===

For experimental setups of chemisorption, the amount of adsorption of a particular system is quantified by a sticking probability value.

However, chemisorption is very difficult to theorize. A multidimensional potential energy surface (PES) derived from effective medium theory is used to describe the effect of the surface on absorption, but only certain parts of it are used depending on what is to be studied. A simple example of a PES, which takes the total of the energy as a function of location:

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the energy eigenvalue of the Schrödinger equation for the electronic degrees of freedom and formula_4 is the ion interactions. This expression is without translational energy, rotational energy, vibrational excitations, and other such considerations.

There exist several models to describe surface reactions: the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism in which both reacting species are adsorbed, and the Eley–Rideal mechanism in which one is adsorbed and the other reacts with it.

Real systems have many irregularities, making theoretical calculations more difficult:

* Solid surfaces are not necessarily at equilibrium. 
* They may be perturbed and irregular, defects and such. 
* Distribution of adsorption energies and odd adsorption sites. 
* Bonds formed between the adsorbates.

Compared to physisorption where adsorbates are simply sitting on the surface, the adsorbates can change the surface, along with its structure. The structure can go through relaxation, where the first few layers change interplanar distances without changing the surface structure, or reconstruction where the surface structure is changed. A direct transition from physisorption to chemisorption has been observed by attaching a CO molecule to the tip of an atomic force microscope and measuring its interaction with a single iron atom.

For example, oxygen can form very strong bonds (~4 eV) with metals, such as Cu(110). This comes with the breaking apart of surface bonds in forming surface-adsorbate bonds. A large restructuring occurs by missing row.

===Dissociative chemisorption===

A particular brand of gas-surface chemisorption is the dissociation of diatomic gas molecules, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. One model used to describe the process is precursor-mediation. The absorbed molecule is adsorbed onto a surface into a precursor state. The molecule then diffuses across the surface to the chemisorption sites. They break the molecular bond in favor of new bonds to the surface. The energy to overcome the activation potential of dissociation usually comes from translational energy and vibrational energy.

An example is the hydrogen and copper system, one that has been studied many times over. It has a large activation energy of 0.35 – 0.85 eV. The vibrational excitation of the hydrogen molecule promotes dissociation on low index surfaces of copper.

<text> ( , ; &#x27;new song&#x27;) is a left-wing social movement and musical genre in Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula, characterized by folk-inspired styles and socially committed lyrics. is widely recognized to have played a profound role in the pro-democracy social upheavals in Portugal, Spain and Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s, and was popular amongst socialist organizations in the region.

Songs reflecting conflict have a long history in Spanish, and in Latin America were particularly associated with the &quot;&quot;corrido&quot; songs of Mexico&#x27;s War of Independence after 1810, and the early 20th century years of Revolution. then surfaced almost simultaneously during the 1960s in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Spain. The musical style emerged shortly afterwards in other areas of Latin America where it came to be known under similar names. renewed traditional Latin American folk music, and was soon associated with revolutionary movements, the Latin American New Left, liberation theology, hippie and human rights movements due to political lyrics. It would gain great popularity throughout Latin America, and left an imprint on several other genres like &quot;rock en español&quot;, cumbia and Andean music.

 musicians often faced censorship, exile, torture, death, or forceful disappearances by the wave of right-wing military dictatorships that swept across Latin America and the Iberian peninsula in the Cold War era, e.g. in Francoist Spain, Pinochet&#x27;s Chile, Salazar&#x27;s Portugal and Videla and Galtieri&#x27;s Argentina.

Due to their strongly political messages, some songs have been used in later political campaigns, for example the Orange Revolution, which used Violeta Parra&#x27;s &quot;Gracias a la vida&quot;&quot;. has become part of Latin American and Iberian musical tradition, but is no longer a mainstream genre, and has given way to other genres, particularly &quot;rock en español&quot;.

==Characteristics==
&quot;&quot; is a type of music which is committed to social good. Its musical and lyrical vernacular is rooted in the popular classes and often uses a popularly understood style of satire to advocate for sociopolitical change. The movement reacted against the dominance of American and European music in Latin America at the time by assuming an anti-imperial stance that was markedly less focused on the visual spectacle of commercial music and more focused on social and political messages. It characteristically talks about poverty, empowerment, imperialism, democracy, human rights, religion, and the Latin American identity.

 draws heavily upon Andean music, música negra, Spanish music, Cuban music and other Latin American folklore. Most songs feature the guitar, and often the quena, zampoña, charango or cajón. The lyrics are typically in Spanish, with some indigenous or local words mixed in, and frequently utilize the poetic forms of copla and décima.

 was explicitly related to leftist politics, advancing leftist ideals and flourishing within the structure of the Communist Party in Latin America. Cuban cultural organization Casa de las Américas hosted many notable gatherings of musicians, including the 1967 Encuentro de la Canción Protesta.

Songs of conflict in Spanish have a very long history, with elements to be found in the &quot;fronterizos&quot;, songs concerning the Reconquest of Spain from the Moors in the 15th century. More immediately, some of the roots of may be seen in the Mexican &quot;corrido&quot;, which took on a strongly political flavour during the War of Independence , and then the Revolution after 1910. The modern developed in the historical context of the &quot;folklore boom&quot; that occurred in Latin America in the 1950s. Chilean Violeta Parra and Argentine Atahualpa Yupanqui were two transitional figures as their mastery of folk music and personal involvement in leftist political organizations aided the eventual union of the two in . The movement was also aided by legislation like Juan Perón&#x27;s Decreto 3371/1949 de Protección de la Música Nacional and Law No. 14,226, which required that half of the music played on the radio or performed live be of national origin.

National manifestations of began occurring in the late 1950s. The earliest were in Chile and Spain, where the movement promoted Catalan language and culture. The music quickly spread to Argentina and throughout Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s. Various national movements used their own terminology; however, the term &quot;&quot; was adopted at the 1967 Encuentro de la Canción Protesta and has thereafter been used as an all-encompassing term. Though is often considered a Pan-Latino phenomenon, national manifestations were varied and reacted to local political and cultural contexts.

==Regional manifestations==

===Chile: &quot;Nueva Canción Chilena&quot; (New Chilean Song)===
Since 1952, Violeta Parra, together with her children, gathered a total of 3,000 songs of peasant origin, and also released a book known as &quot;Cantos Folklóricos Chilenos&quot; (Chilean Folk Songs). In addition, Violeta&#x27;s children Isabel and Ángel founded the cultural center Peña de los Parra, an organization that functioned as an organizing center for leftist political activism, and welcomed almost all of the major figures associated with early , including Chileans: Patricio Manns, Víctor Jara, Rolando Alarcón, Payo Grondona, Patricio Castillo, Sergio Ortega, Homero Caro, Tito Fernández, and Kiko Álvarez, as well as non-Chilean musicians, such as Atahualpa Yupanqui from Argentina and Paco Ibañéz of Spain.

 moved out of small gathering places like Peña de los Parra in 1968 when the Communist Youth Party of Chile pressed 1000 copies of the album &quot;Por Vietnam&quot; by Quilapayún to raise funds for the band&#x27;s travel to the International Youth Festival in Bulgaria. The copies sold out unexpectedly, a strong demonstration of the popular demand for this new music. In response, La Jota (Juventudes Comunistas) created Discoteca de Canto Popular (DICAP), a socially-conscious record label that grew in its five years of operation from a 4,000 record operation in 1968 to pressing over 240,000 records in 1973. DICAP united the various groups of young people wishing to spread Nueva Cancion at a time when U.S. music dominated chiefly commercial radio fare. &quot;DICAP was a key counterhegemonic institution that broke through the censorship and silence imposed by the conservative cultural entities of the elite.&quot;

In 1969 the Universidad Cátolica in Santiago hosted the Primer Festival de la . Salvador Allende&#x27;s 1970 presidential campaign was a major turning point in the history of . Many artists became involved in the campaign; songs like &quot;Venceremos&quot; by Víctor Jara were widely used in Allende rallies. After Allende&#x27;s election, artists were utilized as a pro-Allende public relations machine inside and outside of Chile. By 1971, groups like Inti-Illimani and Quilapayún were receiving financial support from the Allende government.

In 1973, the United States/CIA-backed right-wing military coup overthrew Allende&#x27;s democratic government, bombing the presidential palace. Pinochet&#x27;s forces then rounded up 5,000 civilians into a soccer stadium for interrogation, torture, and execution. Victor Jara was beaten, tortured, and his wrists were broken, after several days he was executed and shot 44 times. His wife Joan Jara writes, &quot;where his belly ought to have been was a gory, gaping void&quot;. Because of his popularity and fame in the music world, Jara is the most well-known victim of a regime that killed or &quot;disappeared&quot; at least 3,065 people and tortured more than 38,000, bringing the number of victims to 40,018. Other musicians, such as Patricio Manns and groups Inti-Illimani and Quilapayún, found safety outside the country. Under Augusto Pinochet recordings were seized, burned, and banned from the airwaves and record stores. The military government exiled and imprisoned artists and went as far as to ban many traditional Andean instruments in order to suppress the movement. This period in Chilean history is known as the &quot;Apagón Cultural&quot; (Cultural Blackout).

By late 1975, artists had begun to circumvent these restrictions through so-called &quot;Andean Baroque&quot; ensembles that performed standards of the Western classical repertoire on indigenous South American instruments. These performances took place in the politically neutral environments of churches, community centers, and the few remaining peñas. For this reason, and because of the novelty of the concept, these performances were allowed to continue without government interference. Performers gradually grew bolder, incorporating some of old repertoire, though carefully avoiding overtly political topics. Artists began calling this music &quot;Canto Nuevo&quot;, a term selected to both reference and distance the new movement from the former . Because of the precarious political circumstances in which it existed, canto nuevo is notable for its use of highly metaphorical language, allowing songs to evade censors by disguising political messages beneath layers of symbolism. Live performances often included spoken introductions or interludes that provided insight into the song&#x27;s real meaning.

As the 1980s arrived, advances in recording technology allowed supporters to informally exchange cassettes outside of the governmental control. An economic crisis forced Chilean television stations to hire cheaper Chilean performers rather than international stars for broadcast bookings, while a relaxation in government restrictions allowed canto nuevo performers to participate in several major popular music festivals. Increasing public recognition of the movement facilitated the gathering of its participants at events such as the Congreso de Artistas y Trabajadores (Conference of Artists and Workers) in 1983. The canto nuevo repertoire began to diversify, incorporating cosmopolitan influences such as electronic instruments, classical harmonies, and jazz influences.

Though the genre is not especially active today, the legacy of figures like Violeta Parra is enormous. Parra&#x27;s music continues to be recorded by contemporary artists and her song &quot;Gracias a la Vida&quot; was recorded by supergroup Artists for Chile in an effort to raise relief funds in the wake of the 2010 Chilean earthquake. The protests that began in October 2019 showed a strong resurgence of as curfewed residents began performing the music of Violeta Parra and Victor Jara 
 and soon major artists began adapting and writing politically motivated music backing the protests and critical of the Piñera government.

===Argentina: &quot;Nuevo Cancionero&quot; (New Songbook)===
In Argentina, the movement was founded under the name Nuevo Cancionero and formally codified on 11 February 1963 when fourteen artists met in Mendoza, Argentina to sign the Manifiesto Fundacional de Nuevo Cancionero. Present were both musical artists and poet writers. The Argentine movement especially was a musico-literal. Writers like Armando Tejada Gomez were highly influential and made substantial contributions to the movement in the form of original poetry. The Manifesto&#x27;s introduction places the roots of Nuevo Cancionero in the rediscovery of folk music and indigenous traditions to the work of folklorists Atahualpa Yupanqui and Buenaventura Luna and the internal urban migration that brought rural Argentines to the capital of Buenos Aires. The body of the document outlines the goal of the movement: the development of a national song that overcome the dominance of tango-folklore in Argentine national music and the rejection of pure commercialism. Instead Nuevo Cancionero sought to embrace of institutions that encouraged critical thinking and the open exchange of ideas.

Nuevo Cancionero&#x27;s most famous proponent was Mercedes Sosa. Her success at the 1965 Cosquin Folklore Festival introduced Nuevo Cancionero to new levels of public exposure after Argentine folk powerhouse Jorge Cafrune singled her out on stage as a budding talent. In 1967, Sosa completed her first international tour in the United States and Europe. Other notable Nuevo Cancionero artists of this time included Tito Francia, Víctor Heredia, and César Isella, who left the folk music group Los Fronterizos to pursue a solo career. In 1969 he set the poetry of Armando Tejada Gomez to produce &quot;Canción para todos&quot;, an anthem later designated by UNESCO the hymn of Latin America.

Nuevo cancionero artists were among the approximately 30,000 victims of forced disappearances under Argentina&#x27;s 1976–1983 military dictatorship. Additional censorship, intimidation, and persecution forced many artists into exile where they had more freedom to publicize and criticize the events unfolding in Latin America. Sosa, for example, participated in the first Amnesty International concert in London in 1979, and also performed in Israel, Canada, Colombia, and Brazil while continuing to record.

After the fall of the dictatorship in 1983, Argentine artists returned and performed massive comeback concerts that regularly filled sports areas and public parks with tens of thousands of people. Influences from time spent in exile abroad were clear through sample of instruments like the harmonica, drum set, bass guitar, electric keyboard, brass ensembles, backup singers, string instruments (especially double bass and violin), and stylistic and harmonic influences from the soundscapes of classical, jazz, pop, rock, and punk. Collaborations became increasingly common, especially between proponents of Nuevo Cancionero and the ideologically similar Rock Nacional.

Nuevo Cancionero artists became symbols of a triumphant national identity. When Mercedes Sosa died, millions flooded the streets as her body lay in official state in the National Cathedral, an honor reserved for only the most prominent of national icons. While the community of musicians actively composing in the Nuevo Cancionero tradition is small, recordings and covers of Nuevo Cancionero classics remain popular in Argentina.

===Cuba: &quot;Nueva Trova&quot; (New Trova)===
Of the regional manifestations of , is distinct because of its function within and support from the Castro government. While in other countries primarily functioned in opposition to existing regimes, emerged after the Cuban Revolution and enjoyed various degrees of state support throughout the late twentieth century. has its roots in the traditional , but differs from it because its content is, in the widest sense, political. It combines traditional folk music idioms with &#x27;progressive&#x27; and often politicized lyrics that concentrate on socialism, injustice, sexism, colonialism, racism and similar &#x27;serious&#x27; issues. Occasional examples of non-political styles in the movement can also be found, for example, Liuba María Hevia, whose lyrics are focused on more traditional subjects such as love and solitude albeit in a highly poetical style. Later musicians were also influenced by rock and pop of that time.

Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés became the most important exponents of the style. Carlos Puebla and Joseíto Fernández were long-time singers who added their weight to the new regime, but of the two only Puebla wrote special pro-revolution songs.

The Castro administration gave plenty of support to musicians willing to write and sing anti-U.S. imperialism or pro-revolution songs, an asset in an era when many traditional musicians were finding it difficult or impossible to earn a living. In 1967 the Casa de las Américas in Havana held a Festival de la canción de protesta (protest songs). Much of the effort was spent applauding anti-U.S. expressions. Tania Castellanos, a filín singer and author, wrote &quot;¡Por Ángela!&quot; in support of US political activist Angela Davis. César Portillo de la Luz wrote &quot;Oh, valeroso Viet Nam&quot;. Institutions like the Grupo de Experimentación Sonora del ICAIC (GES) while not directly working in , provided valuable musical training to amateur Cuban artists.

===Spain and Catalonia: &quot;Nova Cançó&quot;===
The Nova Cançó was an artistic movement of the late 1950s that promoted Catalan music in Francoist Spain. The movement sought to normalize use of the Catalan language after public use of the language was forbidden when Catalonia fell in the Spanish Civil War. Artists used the Catalan language to assert Catalan identity in popular music and denounce the injustices of the Franco regime. Musically, it had roots in the French Chanson.

In 1957, the writer Josep Maria Espinàs gave lectures on the French singer-songwriter Georges Brassens, whom he called &quot;the troubadour of our times.&quot; Espinàs had begun to translate some of Brassens&#x27; songs into Catalan. In 1958, two EPs of songs in Catalan were released: &quot;Hermanas Serrano cantan en catalán los éxitos internacionales&quot; (&quot;The Serrano Sisters Sing International Hits in Catalan&quot;) and &quot;José Guardiola: canta en catalán los éxitos internationales&quot;. They are now considered the first recordings of modern music in the Catalan language. These singers, as well as others such as Font Sellabona and Rudy Ventura, form a prelude to the Nova Cançó.

At the suggestion of Josep Benet i de Joan and Maurici Serrahima, a group composed of Jaume Armengol, Lluís Serrahima and Miquel Porter started composing Catalan songs. In 1959, after an article by Lluís Serrahima, titled &quot;Ens calen cançons d’ara&quot; (&quot;We need songs for today&quot;), was published in &quot;Germinàbit&quot;, more authors and singers were attracted to the movement. Miquel Porter, Josep Maria Espinàs and Remei Margarit founded the group &quot;Els Setze Jutges&quot; (The Sixteen Judges, in Catalan). Their first concert, although still not with this name, was on 19 December 1961, in Barcelona. Their first performance with the name of Els Setze Jutges was in Premià de Mar in 1962. New singers joined the group in the following years, until the number of sixteen (&quot;Setze&quot;), like Delfí Abella and Francesc Pi de la Serra. The first Nova Cançó records appeared in 1962, and many musical bands, vocal groups, singer-songwriters, and interpreters picked up the trend.

In 1963, a professional Catalan artist, Salomé, and a Valencian, Raimon, were awarded the first prize of the Fifth Mediterranean Song Festival with the song &quot;Se’n va anar&quot; (&quot;[She] left&quot;). Other important participants in the movement included Guillem d&#x27;Efak and Núria Feliu, who received the Spanish Critics&#x27; Award in 1966, or other new members of Els Setze Jutges. Some of them were even well known abroad. Apart from Raimon, other former members of Els Setze Jutges continued their careers successfully, including Guillermina Motta, Francesc Pi de la Serra, Maria del Mar Bonet, Lluís Llach and Joan Manuel Serrat. Other significant figures appeared somewhat later, like the Valencian Ovidi Montllor.

===Nicaragua===
Nicaragua (&quot;Nueva canción nicaragüense&quot;) musicians are attributed with transmitting social and political messages, and aiding in the ideological mobilisation of the populace during the Sandinista revolution. Carlos Mejía Godoy y Los de Palacagüina were probably the best known proponents of this style.
