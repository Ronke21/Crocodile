<text>Beaked whales (systematic name Ziphiidae) are a family of cetaceans noted as being one of the least-known groups of mammals because of their deep-sea habitat, reclusive behavior and apparent low abundance. Only three or four of the 24 existing species are reasonably well-known. Baird&#x27;s beaked whales and Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales were subject to commercial exploitation, off the coast of Japan, while the northern bottlenose whale was extensively hunted in the northern part of the North Atlantic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Reports emerged in late 2020 of the possible discovery of a new beaked whale species off the coast of Mexico, the taxonomy of which had not been determined .

==Physical characteristics==

Beaked whales are moderate in size, ranging from and weighing from . Their key distinguishing feature is the presence of a &#x27;beak&#x27;, somewhat similar to many dolphins. Other distinctive features include a pair of converging grooves under the throat, and the absence of a notch in the tail fluke. Although Shepherd&#x27;s beaked whale is an exception, most species have only one or two pairs of teeth, and even these do not erupt in females (other than in the genus &quot;Berardius&quot;). Beaked whale species are often sexually dimorphic one or the other sex is significantly larger. The adult males often possess a large bulging forehead, some to an extreme feature. However, aside from dentition and size, very few morphological differences exist between male and female beaked whales.

Individual species may be very difficult to identify in the wild, since many species appear similar. The observer must rely on size, shape, and placement of teeth and often subtle differences in size, color, forehead shape, and beak length. In collected specimens, the expansion of the premaxillary process in the skull can be a key feature to identification.

The blubber of these whales is almost entirely (94%) composed of wax ester instead of the more usual triacylglycerols, a unique characteristic of this family.

===Dentition===
Beaked whales are unique among toothed whales in that most species have only one pair of teeth. The teeth are tusk-like, but are visible only in males, which are presumed to use these teeth in combat for females for reproductive rights. In females, the teeth do not develop and remain hidden in the gum tissues.

In December 2008, researchers from the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University completed a DNA tree of 13 of 15 known species of &quot;Mesoplodon&quot; beaked whales (excluding the spade-toothed whale, which was then only known from a skeletal specimen and a few stranded specimens). Among the results of this study was the conclusion that the male&#x27;s teeth are actually a secondary sexual characteristic, similar to the antlers of male deer. Each species&#x27; teeth have a characteristically unique shape. In some cases, these teeth even hinder feeding; in the strap-toothed whale, for example, the teeth curve over the upper jaw, effectively limiting the gape to a few centimeters. Females are presumed to select mates based on the shape of the teeth, because the different species are otherwise quite similar in appearance.

==Taxonomy==
As of 2024, the Society for Marine Mammalogy Committee on Taxonomy recognizes 24 extant (living) species of beaked whales in six genera. Several species have only been formally described in the last two decades, most recently in 2021.

The beaked whales are the second-largest family of cetaceans after the oceanic dolphins (Delphinidae). Beaked whales were one of the first extant clades to diverge from the ancestral lineage. The earliest known beaked whale fossils date to the Miocene, about 15 million years ago.

A 2016 study split the beaked whales into the basal extinct Messapicetus clade (lineage) and the crown Ziphiidae which include all of the living members of the family as well as other extinct forms. Both clades share some key characteristics of the family including thick skull bones and the trend toward loss of teeth. In 2020, a molecular study further resolved the relationships among the crown Ziphiidae and placed Shepherd&#x27;s beaked whale, the only living species with a full set of erupted teeth, between Berardiinae, whose extant forms have four erupted teeth, and Ziphiinae, whose extant form has two erupted teeth.

===Etymology===
The name Ziphiidae was coined from the genus &quot;Ziphius&quot; by J. E. Gray in 1865 to move the beaked whales from the family Delphinidae into a new family. Gray noted in 1866, however, that Hyperoodontidae should have priority for the new beaked whale family name owing to earlier usage (in 1846), but Gray preferred Ziphiidae due to an apparent confusion between the upper and lower jaw (or the terminology) in the naming of &quot;Hyperoodon&quot;.

Hyperoodontidae was preferred in a 1968 phylogeny, which stated that Gray&#x27;s objection did not qualify as an exception under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). Hyperoodontidae is indeed currently marked as the valid name by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) which states no successful petition for Ziphiidae had been made to the ICZN as of 2023. In contrast, Smithsonian researchers J.G. Mead and Robert Brownell Jr. argued in 1993 that due to being the &quot;name of choice for over 100 years&quot;, Ziphiidae should be given exception under the ICZN Article 23.12. In addition, several authorities, including the Society for Marine Mammalogy Committee on Taxonomy and IUCN Red List of Threatened Species among others continue to use Ziphiidae.

A further, unrelated confusion has arisen, as noted on the ITIS, due to the propagation of an incorrect citation of &quot;Gray, 1850&quot; for Ziphiidae.

===Evolutionary history===
As many as 26 genera antedate humans. These include ancestors of giant beaked whales (&quot;Berardius&quot;), such as &quot;Microberardius&quot;, and ancestors of Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Ziphius&quot;); they had many relatives, such as &quot;Caviziphius&quot;, &quot;Archaeoziphius&quot;, and &quot;Izikoziphius&quot;. They were probably preyed upon by predatory whales and sharks, including &quot;Otodus megalodon&quot;. Recently, a large fossil ziphiid sample was discovered off the South African coast, confirming the extant ziphiid diversity might just be a remnant of a higher past diversity. After studying numerous fossil skulls off the shore of Iberia and South Africa, researchers discovered the absence of functional maxillary teeth in all South African fossil ziphiids, which is evidence that suction feeding had already developed in several beaked whale lineages during the Miocene. Researchers also found fossil ziphiids with robust skulls, signaling that tusks were used for male-male interactions (speculated with extant beaked whales).

==Ecology==

===Diving===

Beaked whales are deep divers with extreme dive profiles. They regularly dive deeper than to echolocate for food, and these deep dives are often followed by multiple shallower dives less than 500 m. This pattern is not always followed, however. Animals have been observed spending more than an hour at or near the surface breathing. Beaked whales are often seen surfacing synchronously, but asynchronous surfacing has also been observed. In March 2014, a study by Cascadia Research revealed that Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales were recorded to dive at least 2992 m in depth, a mammalian record. Another study, published in 2020, reported a Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale making a dive that lasted 222 minutes, another mammalian record.

Deep-diving mammals face a number of challenges related to extended breath-holding and hydrostatic pressure. Cetaceans and pinnipeds that prolong apnea must optimize the size and use of their oxygen stores, and they must deal with the accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic metabolism. Beaked whales have several anatomical adaptations to deep diving: large spleens, livers, and body shape. Most cetaceans have small spleens. However, beaked whales have much larger spleens than delphinids, and may have larger livers, as well. These anatomical traits, which are important for filtering blood, could be adaptations to deep diving. Another notable anatomical adaptation among beaked whales is a slight depression in the body wall that allows them to hold their pectoral flippers tightly against their bodies for increased streamlining. However, they are not invulnerable to the effects of diving so deep and so often. Cascadia Research shows that the deeper the whales dive, the less often they dive per day, cutting their efforts by at least 40%.

The challenges of deep diving are also overcome by the unique diving physiology of beaked whales. Oxygen storage during dives is mostly achieved by blood hemoglobin and muscle myoglobin. While the whale is diving, its heart rate slows and blood flow changes. This physiological dive response ensures oxygen-sensitive tissues maintain a supply of oxygen, while those tissues tolerant to hypoxia receive less blood flow. Additionally, lung collapse obviates the exchange of lung gas with blood, likely minimizing the uptake of nitrogen by tissues.

===Feeding===
The throats of all beaked whales have a bilaterally paired set of grooves that are associated with their unique feeding mechanism, suction feeding. Instead of capturing prey with their teeth, beaked whales suck it into their oral cavity. Suction is aided by the throat grooves, which stretch and expand to accommodate food. Their tongues can move very freely. By suddenly retracting the tongue and distending the gular (throat) floor, pressure immediately drops within the mouth, sucking the prey in with the water.

Dietary information is available from stomach contents analyses of stranded beaked whales and from whaling operations. Their preferred diet is primarily deep-water squid, but also benthic and benthopelagic fish and some crustaceans, mostly taken near the sea floor. In a recent study, gouge marks in the sea floor were interpreted to be a result of feeding activities by beaked whales.

To understand the hunting and foraging behavior of beaked whales, researchers used sound and orientation recording devices on two species: Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Ziphius cavirostris&quot;) and Blainville&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Mesoplodon densirostris&quot;). These whales hunt by echolocation in deep water (where the majority of their prey is located) between about and usually catch about 30 prey per dive. Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales must forage on average at for 58 minutes and Blainville&#x27;s beaked whales typically forage at deep for an average of 47 minutes.

===Range and habitat===
The family Ziphiidae is one of the most widespread families of cetaceans, ranging from the ice edges at both the north and south poles, to the equator in all the oceans. Specific ranges vary greatly by species, though beaked whales typically inhabit offshore waters that are at least 300 m deep.

Beaked whales are known to congregate in deep waters off the edge of continental shelves, and bottom features, such as seamounts, canyons, escarpments, and oceanic islands, including the Azores and the Canary Islands, and even off the coasts of Hawaii.

==Life history==
Very little is known about the life history of beaked whales. The oldest recorded age is 84 years for a male Baird&#x27;s beaked whale and 54 years for a female. For all other beaked whale species studied, the oldest recorded age is between 27 and 39 years. Sexual maturity is reached between seven and 15 years of age in Baird&#x27;s beaked whales and northern bottlenose whales. Gestation varies greatly between species, lasting 17 months for Baird&#x27;s beaked whales and 12 months for the northern bottlenose whale. No data is available on their reproductive rates.

Determining group size for beaked whales is difficult, due to their inconspicuous surfacing behavior. Groups of beaked whales, defined as all individuals found in the same location at the same time, have been reported as ranging from one to 100 individuals. Nevertheless, some populations&#x27; group size has been estimated from repeated observations. For example, northern and southern bottlenose whales (&quot;H. ampullatus&quot; and &quot;H. planifrons&quot;), Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales, and Blainville&#x27;s beaked whales (&quot;Mesoplodon densirostris&quot;) have a reported maximum group size of 20 individuals, with the average ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 individuals. &quot;Berardius&quot; species and Longman&#x27;s beaked whales (&quot;Indopacetus pacificus&quot;) are found in larger groups of up to 100 individuals.

Not much information is available about group composition of beaked whales. Only four species have been studied in great detail: northern bottlenose whale, Blainville&#x27;s beaked whale, Baird&#x27;s beaked whale, and Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale. Female northern bottlenose whales appear to form a loose network of social partners with no obvious long-term associations. In contrast to females, some male northern bottlenose whales have been repeatedly recorded together over several years, and possibly form long-term associations. Studies of Blainville&#x27;s beaked whales have revealed groups usually consist of a number of females, calves, and/or juvenile animals occasionally accompanied by single males. Drawing on similarities with other mammal species, it has been concluded that this species may therefore engage in female-defense polygyny. Baird&#x27;s beaked whales are known to occur in multiple male groups, and in large groups consisting of adult animals of both sexes. There has been some evidence from the Commander islands of multi-year stability in these groups. Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales have also been observed to form large pods of up to 47 individuals off the Southern Ocean off the coast of Kemp Land, Antarctica. While males may form short-term associations in the Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale, there do not appear to be long term bonds in this species and relatively high rates of fission and fusion within and among groups have been observed.

==Conservation==

For many years, most beaked whale species were insulated from anthropogenic impacts because of their remote habitat. However, now several issues of concern include:

* Studies of stranded beaked whales show rising levels of toxic chemicals in their blubber.
* As a top predator, beaked whales, like raptors, are particularly vulnerable to build-up of biocontaminants. They can ingest plastic (which can be lethal).
* They more frequently become trapped in trawl nets, due to the expansion of deepwater fisheries.
* Decompression sickness

A major conservation concern for beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) is they appear to be vulnerable to modern sonar operations, which arises from recent strandings that temporally and physically coincide with naval sonar exercises. Mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS), developed in the 1950s for submarine detection, is thought to induce panic when experienced by whales at depth. This raises their heart-rates, forcing them to attempt to rapidly ascend toward the surface in search of air. This artificially-induced rapid ascent can cause decompression.

&quot;Post mortem&quot; examinations of the stranded whales in concurrence with naval exercises have reported the presence of hemorrhaging near the ears or gas and fat emboli, which could have a deleterious impact on beaked whales that is analogous to decompression sickness in humans. Gas and fat emboli have been shown to cause nervous and cardiovascular system dysfunction, respiratory distress, pain, and disorientation in both humans and animals. In the inner ear, gas embolism can cause hemorrhages, leading to disorientation or vestibular dysfunction.

Breath-holding divers, like beaked whales, can develop decompression-related problems (the &quot;bends&quot;) when they return to the surface after deep dives. This is a possible hypothesis for the mass strandings of pelagic beaked whales associated with sonar-related activities. To illustrate, a diving beaked whale may be surfacing from a deep dive and must pass vertically through varying received sound levels. Since the whale has limited remaining oxygen supplies at the end of a long dive, it probably has limited abilities to display any normal sound avoidance behavior. Instead, the whale must continue to swim toward the surface to replenish its oxygen stores. Avoiding sonar inevitably requires a change in behavior or surfacing pattern. Therefore, sonar in close proximity to groups of beaked whales has the potential to cause hemorrhaging or to disorient the animal, eventually leading to a stranding.

Current research reveals two species of beaked whales are most affected by sonar: Cuvier&#x27;s (&quot;Z. cavirostris&quot;) and Blainville&#x27;s (&quot;M. densirostris&quot;) beaked whales. These animals have been reported as stranding in correlation with military exercises in Greece, the Bahamas, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. The livers of these animals had the most damage.

In 2019, a review of evidence on the mass strandings of beaked whale linked to naval exercises where sonar was used was published. It concluded that the effects of mid-frequency active sonar are strongest on Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales but vary among individuals or populations, and the strength of their response may depend on whether the individuals had prior exposure to sonar. The report considered that the most plausible explanation of the symptoms of decompression sickness such as gas embolism found in stranded whales to be the whales&#x27; response to sonar. It noted that no more mass strandings had occurred in the Canary Islands once naval exercises where sonar was used were banned there, and recommended that the ban be extended to other areas where mass strandings continue to occur.

Four species are classified by the IUCN as &quot;lower risk, conservation dependent&quot;: Arnoux&#x27;s and Baird&#x27;s beaked whales, and the northern and southern bottlenose whales. The status of the remaining species is unknown, preventing classification.

==Captivity==

Beaked whales have only rarely been kept in captivity and generally for very short time periods. Most animals taken into captivity have been captured after live-stranding and may have been in poor health only to die shortly thereafter.

The longest time period for a beaked whale living in captivity was 25 days, the record held by a whale named Alexander, one of two presumed Hubbs&#x27; beaked whale calves that stranded on August 24, 1989, on a beach in San Francisco, California, USA. Both whales were taken to Marine World Africa USA, in Vallejo, California. The animals were kept in a 9.7 meter diameter by 2.7 meter deep pool. The second whale, named Nicholas, died after 15 days in captivity. Alexander, the smaller of the two whales, died of pneumonia, while the cause of death for Nicholas was not determined.

A small number of other beaked whales have been kept in captivity. Notably, a Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale captured on 02 February, 1992 and held at Sea World of Florida was released after nine days about 30 miles offshore into the Atlantic Ocean. Perhaps the only successful release of a beaked whale, the animal was freeze branded for future identification before release. A rare True&#x27;s beaked whale, later named Hope, the only member of its species known to be held in captivity, was taken after live-stranding on 02 January, 1973. It was held for about two days in a backyard swimming pool which had been pumped full of seawater before being transferred to the Coney Island Aquarium where it died approximately 2 days later. A juvenile female Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale was found stranded on a kelp bed off of Santa Catalina Island on 23 February 1956. She was taken to Marineland of the Pacific, where she was named Martha Washington. On 16 June 1969, a Blainville&#x27;s beaked whale live stranded in St. Augustine. The whale, thought to be a male, was then transported to Marineland of Florida. It is unknown what happened to the whale, but it was still alive on 18 June 1969.

<doc id="72725" wikidata="Q3846871" url="?curid=72725" title="Margaret Holland, Duchess of Clarence">
<text>Margaret Holland (1385 – 30 December 1439) was a medieval English noblewoman and a member of the powerful Holland family. Through her marriages she became Countess of Somerset and Duchess of Clarence. She was &quot;at the very centre of royal power and prestige&quot; throughout her lifetime.

== Early life ==
Margaret was a daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, who was the son of Joan &quot;the Fair Maid of Kent&quot; (granddaughter of Edward I of England, wife of Edward the Black Prince and mother of Richard II of England). Margaret&#x27;s mother was Alice FitzAlan, daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel and Eleanor of Lancaster.

== Marriages and issue ==
Margaret married John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, son of John of Gaunt and his mistress Katherine Swynford. They had six children:
* Henry Beaufort, 2nd Earl of Somerset (1401–1418).
* Joan Beaufort (d. 1445), who married James I of Scotland and Sir James Stewart, the Black Knight of Lorn.
* John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset (1404–1444), who married Margaret Beauchamp.
* Thomas Beaufort, Count of Perche (c. 1405–1431). Died at the Siege of Louviers.
* Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset (c. 1406–1455) who married Eleanor Beauchamp, daughter of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, by his first wife Elizabeth de Berkeley.
* Margaret Beaufort (c. 1408–1449), who married Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon.

In 1399, she was invested as a Lady Companion, Order of the Garter (L.G.).

After her husband John Beaufort died in 1410, she married his half nephew Thomas of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence (1387–1421), the son of King Henry IV. They had no children, although Thomas was stepfather to her six children from her first marriage, who were his first cousins.

== Later life and Death ==
In 1419 she travelled to Normandy with her sons to be with her husband there, leaving her daughters in the care of the Prioress of Dartford. Her husband died on 22 March 1421 fighting at the Battle of Baugé, Anjou, France. She was an executrix of his will alongside executors John Colvylle of Neuton, Cambridgeshire, knight, and Henry Merston of Westminster, clerk.

In 1430 a book about the life of St. Jerome was made for her by Symon Wynter of Syon Abbey.

Margaret retired to St. Saviour&#x27;s Abbey, Bermondsey, London, where she died on 30 December 1439.

Margaret and both her husbands are buried together in a carved alabaster tomb in Canterbury Cathedral that she commissioned. The monument shows her lying in repose between her two husbands, which is extremely rare. Her husbands had been buried in the Trinity Chapel and were exhumed to be reburied alongside Margaret.

==Descendants==
Through her son John, the 1st Duke of Somerset, and his wife Margaret Beauchamp, Lady Margaret is an ancestress to the Tudor monarchs.

<doc id="72726" wikidata="Q496325" url="?curid=72726" title="Thrust fault">
<text>A thrust fault is a break in the Earth&#x27;s crust, across which older rocks are pushed above younger rocks.

==Thrust geometry and nomenclature==

===Reverse faults===
A thrust fault is a type of reverse fault that has a dip of 45 degrees or less.

If the angle of the fault plane is lower (often less than 15 degrees from the horizontal) and the displacement of the overlying block is large (often in the kilometer range) the fault is called an &quot;overthrust&quot; or &quot;overthrust fault&quot;. Erosion can remove part of the overlying block, creating a &quot;fenster&quot; (or &quot;window&quot;) – when the underlying block is exposed only in a relatively small area. When erosion removes most of the overlying block, leaving island-like remnants resting on the lower block, the remnants are called &quot;klippen&quot; (singular &quot;klippe&quot;).

===Blind thrust faults===

If the fault plane terminates before it reaches the Earth&#x27;s surface, it is called a &quot;blind thrust&quot; fault. Because of the lack of surface evidence, blind thrust faults are difficult to detect until rupture. The destructive 1994 earthquake in Northridge, Los Angeles, California, was caused by a previously undiscovered blind thrust fault.

Because of their low dip, thrusts are also difficult to appreciate in mapping, where lithological offsets are generally subtle and stratigraphic repetition is difficult to detect, especially in peneplain areas.

===Fault-bend folds===
Thrust faults, particularly those involved in thin-skinned style of deformation, have a so-called &quot;ramp-flat&quot; geometry. Thrusts mainly propagate along zones of weakness within a sedimentary sequence, such as mudstones or halite layers; these parts of the thrust are called &quot;decollements&quot;. If the effectiveness of the decollement becomes reduced, the thrust will tend to cut up the section to a higher stratigraphic level until it reaches another effective decollement where it can continue as bedding parallel flat. The part of the thrust linking the two flats is known as a &quot;ramp&quot; and typically forms at an angle of about 15°–30° to the bedding. Continued displacement on a thrust over a ramp produces a characteristic fold geometry known as a &quot;ramp anticline&quot; or, more generally, as a &quot;fault-bend fold&quot;.

===Fault-propagation folds===
Fault-propagation folds form at the tip of a thrust fault where propagation along the decollement has ceased, but displacement on the thrust behind the fault tip continues. The formation of an asymmetric anticline-syncline fold pair accommodates the continuing displacement. As displacement continues, the thrust tip starts to propagate along the axis of the syncline. Such structures are also known as &quot;tip-line folds&quot;. Eventually, the propagating thrust tip may reach another effective decollement layer, and a composite fold structure will develop with fault-bending and fault-propagation folds&#x27; characteristics.

===Thrust duplex===

Duplexes occur where two decollement levels are close to each other within a sedimentary sequence, such as the top and base of a relatively strong sandstone layer bounded by two relatively weak mudstone layers. When a thrust that has propagated along the lower detachment, known as the &quot;floor thrust&quot;, cuts up to the upper detachment, known as the &quot;roof thrust&quot;, it forms a ramp within the stronger layer. With continued displacement on the thrust, higher stresses are developed in the footwall of the ramp due to the bend on the fault. This may cause renewed propagation along the floor thrust until it again cuts up to join the roof thrust. Further displacement then takes place via the newly created ramp. This process may repeat many times, forming a series of fault-bounded thrust slices known as &quot;imbricates&quot; or horses, each with the geometry of a fault-bend fold of small displacement. The final result is typically a lozenge-shaped duplex.

Most duplexes have only small displacements on the bounding faults between the horses, which dip away from the foreland. Occasionally, the displacement on the individual horses is more significant, such that each horse lies more or less vertically above the other; this is known as an &quot;antiformal stack&quot; or imbricate stack. If the individual displacements are still greater, the horses have a foreland dip.

Duplexing is a very efficient mechanism of accommodating the shortening of the crust by thickening the section rather than by folding and deformation.

==Tectonic environment==
Large overthrust faults occur in areas that have undergone great compressional forces.

These conditions exist in the orogenic belts that result from either two continental tectonic collisions or from subduction zone accretion.

The resultant compressional forces produce mountain ranges. The Himalayas, the Alps, and the Appalachians are prominent examples of compressional orogenies with numerous overthrust faults.

Thrust faults occur in the foreland basin, marginal to orogenic belts. Here, compression does not result in appreciable mountain building, which is mostly accommodated by folding and stacking of thrusts. Instead, thrust faults generally cause a thickening of the stratigraphic section. When thrusts are developed in orogens formed in previously rifted margins, inversion of the buried paleo-rifts can induce the nucleation of thrust ramps.

Foreland basin thrusts also usually observe the ramp-flat geometry, with thrusts propagating within units at very low angle &quot;flats&quot; (at 1–5 degrees) and then moving up-section in steeper ramps (at 5–20 degrees) where they offset stratigraphic units. Thrusts have also been detected in cratonic settings, where &quot;far-foreland&quot; deformation has advanced into intracontinental areas.

Thrusts and duplexes are also found in accretionary wedges in the ocean trench margin of subduction zones, where oceanic sediments are scraped off the subducted plate and accumulate. Here, the accretionary wedge must thicken by up to 200%, and this is achieved by stacking thrust fault upon thrust fault in a melange of disrupted rock, often with chaotic folding. Here, ramp flat geometries are not usually observed because the compressional force is at a steep angle to the sedimentary layering.
==History==
Thrust faults were unrecognised until the work of Arnold Escher von der Linth, Albert Heim and Marcel Alexandre Bertrand in the Alps working on the Glarus Thrust; Charles Lapworth, Ben Peach and John Horne working on parts of the Moine Thrust in the Scottish Highlands; Alfred Elis Törnebohm in the Scandinavian Caledonides and R. G. McConnell in the Canadian Rockies. The realisation that older strata could, via faulting, be found above younger strata was arrived at more or less independently by geologists in all these areas during the 1880s. Geikie in 1884 coined the term &quot;thrust-plane&quot; to describe this special set of faults. He wrote:
By a system of reversed faults, a group of strata is made to cover a great breadth of ground and actually to overlie higher members of the same series. The most extraordinary dislocations, however, are those to which for distinction we have given the name of Thrust-planes. They are strictly reversed faults, but with so low a hade that the rocks on their upthrown side have been, as it were, pushed horizontally forward.

<text>The Green Revolution, or the Third Agricultural Revolution, was a period of technology transfer initiatives that saw greatly increased crop yields. These changes in agriculture began in developed countries in the early 20th century and spread globally until the late 1980s. In the late 1960s, farmers began incorporating new technologies such as high-yielding varieties of cereals, particularly dwarf wheat and rice, and the widespread use of chemical fertilizers (to produce their high yields, the new seeds require far more fertilizer than traditional varieties), pesticides, and controlled irrigation. 

At the same time, newer methods of cultivation, including mechanization, were adopted, often as a package of practices to replace traditional agricultural technology. This was often in conjunction with loans conditional on policy changes being made by the developing nations adopting them, such as privatizing fertilizer manufacture and distribution.

Both the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation were heavily involved in its initial development in Mexico. A key leader was agricultural scientist Norman Borlaug, the &quot;Father of the Green Revolution&quot;, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. He is credited with saving over a billion people from starvation. Another important scientific figure was Yuan Longping, whose work on hybrid rice varieties is credited with saving at least as many lives. Similarly, MS Swaminathan is known as the Father of Green Revolution in India. The basic approach was the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers. As crops began to reach the maximum improvement possible through selective breeding, genetic modification technologies were developed to allow for continued efforts.

Studies show that the Green Revolution contributed to widespread eradication of poverty, averted hunger for millions, raised incomes, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, reduced land use for agriculture, and contributed to declines in infant mortality.

==History==

=== Use of the term ===

The term &quot;Green Revolution&quot; was first used by William S. Gaud, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in a speech on 8 March 1968. He noted the spread of the new technologies as: 

=== Development in Mexico ===

Mexico has been called the &#x27;birthplace&#x27; and &#x27;burial ground&#x27; of the Green Revolution. It began with great promise and it has been argued that &quot;during the twentieth century two &#x27;revolutions&#x27; transformed rural Mexico: the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) and the Green Revolution (1940–1970).&quot;

The genesis of the Green Revolution was a lengthy visit in 1940 by U.S. Vice President-elect Henry A. Wallace, who had served as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture during President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s first two terms, and before government service, had founded a company, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, that had revolutionized the hybridization of seed corn to greatly increase crop yields. He became appalled at the meager corn yields in Mexico, where 80 percent of the people lived off the land, and a Mexican farmer had to work as much as 500 hours to produce a single bushel of corn, about 50 times longer than the typical Iowa farmer planting hybrid seed. Wallace persuaded the Rockefeller Foundation to fund an agricultural station in Mexico to hybridize corn and wheat for arid climates, and to lead it, he hired a young Iowa agronomist named Norman Borlaug. 

The project was supported by the Mexican government under new President Manuel Ávila Camacho, and the U.S. government, the United Nations, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). For the U.S. government, its neighbor Mexico was an important experimental case in the use of technology and scientific expertise in agriculture that became the model for international agricultural development. Mexico sought to transform agricultural productivity, particularly with irrigated rather than dry-land cultivation in its northwest, to solve its problem of lack of food self-sufficiency. In the center and south of Mexico, where large-scale production faced challenges, agricultural production languished. Increased production promised food self-sufficiency in Mexico to feed its growing and urbanizing population with the increase in a number of calories consumed per Mexican. The science of hybridization was seen as a valuable way to feed the poor and would relieve some pressure of the land redistribution process. In general, the success of &quot;Green Revolution&quot; depended on the use of machinery for cultivation and harvest, on large-scale agricultural enterprises with access to credit (often from foreign investors), government-supported infrastructure projects, and access to low-wage agricultural workers.

Within eight years of Wallace&#x27;s visit, Mexico had no need to import food, for the first time since 1910; within 20 years, corn production had tripled, and wheat production had increased five-fold. In 1943, Mexico imported half of its wheat requirements, however by 1956 it had become self-sufficient and it was exporting half a million tons of wheat by 1964. Within 30 years, Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for ultimately saving two billion people from starvation.

Mexico was the recipient of knowledge and technology of the Green Revolution, and it was an active participant with financial supports from the government for agriculture and Mexican agronomists. In the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution, the government had redistributed land to ejidatarios in some parts of the country which had broken the back of the hacienda system. During the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas (1934–1940), land reform in Mexico reached its apex in the center and south of Mexico. Agricultural productivity had fallen significantly by the 1940s.

After Borlaug&#x27;s agricultural station was established, in 1941, a team of U.S. scientists, Richard Bradfield (Cornell University), Paul C. Mangelsdorf (Harvard University), and Elvin Charles Stakman (under whom Borlaug had studied at the University of Minnesota) surveyed Mexican agriculture to recommend policies and practices. In 1943, the Mexican government founded the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), which became a base for international agricultural research. 

Agriculture in Mexico had been a sociopolitical issue, a key factor in some regions&#x27; participation in the Mexican Revolution. It was also a technical issue enabled by a cohort of trained agronomists who advised ejidatarios on how to increase productivity. In the post-World War II era, the government sought development in agriculture that bettered technological aspects of agriculture in regions not dominated by small-scale ejido cultivators. This drive for agricultural transformation brought Mexico self-sufficiency in food, and in the political sphere during the Cold War, helped stem unrest and the appeal of Communism.

The Mexican government created the Mexican Agricultural Program (MAP) to be the lead organization in raising productivity. Mexico became the showcase for extending the Green Revolution to other areas of Latin America and beyond, into Africa and Asia. New breeds of maize, beans, and wheat produced bumper crops with additional inputs (such as fertilizer and pesticides) and careful cultivation. Many Mexican farmers who had been dubious about the scientists or hostile to them (often a mutual relationship of discord) came to see the scientific approach to agriculture as worth adopting.

The requirements for the full package of inputs of new strains of seeds, fertilizer, synthetic pesticides, and water were often not within the reach of small-scale farmers. The application of pesticides could be hazardous for farmers. Their use often damaged the local ecology, contaminating waterways and endangering the health of workers and newborns.

One of the participants in the Mexican experiment, Edwin J. Wellhausen, summarized the factors leading to its initial success. These include: high yield plants without disease resistivity, adaptability, and ability to use fertilizers; improved use of soils, adequate fertilizers, and control of weeds and pests; and &quot;a favorable ratio between the cost of fertilizers (and other investments) to the price of the produce.&quot;

=== IR8 rice and the Philippines ===

In 1960 during the administration of President Carlos P. Garcia the Government of the Republic of the Philippines with the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation established the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). A rice crossing between Dee-Geo-woo-gen and Peta was done at IRRI in 1962. In 1966, one of the breeding lines became a new cultivar: IR8 rice. The administration of President Ferdinand Marcos made the promotion of IR8 the lynchpin of the Masagana 99 program, along with a credit program. The new variety required the use of fertilizers and pesticides but produced substantially higher yields than the traditional cultivars. Annual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades. The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century, though imports still exceeded exports, according to data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. From 1966 to 1986, the Philippines imported around 2,679,000 metric tons and exported only 632,000 metric tons of milled rice. By 1980, however, problems with the credit scheme rendered the loans accessible only to rich landowners while leaving poor farmers in debt.
 The program was also noted to have become a vehicle of political patronage.

===Start in India===

In 1961, Norman Borlaug was invited to India by the adviser to the Indian Minister of Agriculture Dr. M. S. Swaminathan. Despite bureaucratic hurdles imposed by India&#x27;s grain monopolies, the Ford Foundation and Indian government collaborated to import wheat seed from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). The state of Punjab was selected by the Indian government to be the first site to try the new crops because of its reliable water supply, the presence of Indus plains which make it one of the most fertile plains on earth, and a history of agricultural success. India began its own Green Revolution program of plant breeding, irrigation development, and financing of agrochemicals.

India soon adopted IR8 rice. In 1968, Indian agronomist S.K. De Datta published his findings that IR8 rice yielded about 5 tons per hectare with no fertilizer, and almost 10 tons per hectare under optimal conditions. This was 10 times the yield of traditional rice. IR8 was a success throughout Asia and dubbed the &quot;Miracle Rice&quot;. IR8 was also developed into Semi-dwarf IR36.

In the 1960s, rice yields in India were about two tons per hectare; by the mid-1990s, they had risen to 6 tons per hectare. In the 1970s, rice cost about $550 a ton; in 2001, it cost under $200 a ton. India became one of the world&#x27;s most successful rice producers, and is now a major rice exporter, shipping nearly 4.5 million tons in 2006.

=== Green Revolution in China ===

China&#x27;s large and increasing population meant that increasing food production, principally rice, was a top priority for the Chinese government. When the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party made it a priority to pursue agricultural development. They sought to solve China&#x27;s food security issues by focusing on traditional crop production, biological pest control, the implementation of modern technology and science, creating food reserves for the population, high-yield seed varieties, multi-cropping, controlled irrigation, and protecting food security. This began with the Agrarian Reform Law of 1950, which ended private land ownership and gave land back to the peasants. Unlike with Mexico, the Philippines, India, or Brazil, the beginning of China&#x27;s unique Green Revolution were unrelated to the American &quot;Green Revolution.&quot; Rather, it was characterized by the government&#x27;s sponsorship of agricultural research in concert with peasant knowledge and feedback, earlier international research, nature-based pest control and many other non-industrial agricultural practices, in order to feed the rapidly growing population. 

Prominent in the development of productive hybrid rice was Yuan Longping, whose research hybridized wild strains of rice with existing strains. He has been dubbed &quot;the father of hybrid rice&quot;, and was considered a national hero in China. Chinese rice production met the nation&#x27;s food security needs, and today they are a leading exporter of rice. In recent years, however, extensive use of ground water for irrigation has drawn down aquifers and extensive use of fertilizers has increased greenhouse gas emissions. China has not expanded the area of cultivable land, China&#x27;s unique high yields per hectare gave China the food security it sought. In 1979, there were 490 million Chinese people living in poverty. In 2014, there were only 82 million. Half of China&#x27;s population had once been hungry and in poverty, but by 2014, only 6% remained so.

===Brazil&#x27;s agricultural revolution===

Brazil&#x27;s vast inland cerrado region was regarded as unfit for farming before the 1960s because the soil was too acidic and poor in nutrients, according to Norman Borlaug. However, from the 1960s, vast quantities of lime (pulverized chalk or limestone) were poured on the soil to reduce acidity. The effort went on for decades; by the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tons of lime were being spread on Brazilian fields each year. The quantity rose to 25 million tons in 2003 and 2004, equaling around five tons of lime per hectare. As a result, Brazil has become the world&#x27;s second biggest soybean exporter. Soybeans are also widely used in animal feed, and the large volume of soy produced in Brazil has contributed to Brazil&#x27;s rise to become the biggest exporter of beef and poultry in the world. Several parallels can also be found in Argentina&#x27;s boom in soybean production as well.

===Problems in Africa===

There have been numerous attempts to introduce the successful concepts from the Mexican and Indian projects into Africa. These programs have generally been less successful. Reasons cited include widespread corruption, insecurity, a lack of infrastructure, and a general lack of will on the part of the governments. Yet environmental factors, such as the availability of water for irrigation, the high diversity in slope and soil types in one given area are also reasons why the Green Revolution is not so successful in Africa.

A recent program in western Africa is attempting to introduce a new high yielding &#x27;family&#x27; of rice varieties known as &quot;New Rice for Africa&quot; (NERICA). NERICA varieties yield about 30% more rice under normal conditions and can double yields with small amounts of fertilizer and very basic irrigation. However, the program has been beset by problems getting the rice into the hands of farmers, and to date the only success has been in Guinea, where it currently accounts for 16% of rice cultivation.

After a famine in 2001 and years of chronic hunger and poverty, in 2005 the small African country of Malawi launched the &quot;Agricultural Input Subsidy Program&quot; by which vouchers are given to smallholder farmers to buy subsidized nitrogen fertilizer and corn seeds. Within its first year, the program was reported to have had extreme success, producing the largest corn harvest of the country&#x27;s history, enough to feed the country with tons left over. The program has advanced yearly ever since. Various sources claim that the program has been an unusual success, hailing it as a &quot;miracle&quot;. Malawi experienced a 40% drop in corn production in 2015 and 2016.

A 2021, a randomized control trial on temporary subsidies for corn farmers in Mozambique found that adoption of Green Revolution technology led to increased yields in both the short- and long-term.

=== Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ===

In 1970, the year that Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize, foundation officials proposed a worldwide network of agricultural research centers under a permanent secretariat. This was further supported and developed by the World Bank; on 19 May 1971, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) was established, co-sponsored by the FAO, IFAD, and UNDP. CGIAR has added many research centers throughout the world.
CGIAR has responded, at least in part, to criticisms of Green Revolution methodologies. This began in the 1980s, and mainly was a result of pressure from donor organizations. Methods like agroecosystem analysis and farming system research have been adopted to gain a more holistic view of agriculture.

== Agricultural production and food security ==

According to a 2012 review in &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; of the existing academic literature, the Green Revolution &quot;contributed to widespread poverty reduction, averted hunger for millions of people, and avoided the conversion of thousands of hectares of land into agricultural cultivation.&quot;

===Technological Developments===

The Green Revolution spread technologies that already existed but had not been widely implemented outside industrialized nations. Two kinds of technologies were used in the Green Revolution, on the issues of cultivation and breeding. The technologies in cultivation are targeted at providing excellent growing conditions, which include modern irrigation projects, pesticides, and synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. The breeding technologies aimed at improving crop varieties developed through science-based methods including hybrids, combining modern genetics with plant-breeding trait selections.

==== High-yielding varieties ====

The novel technological development of the Green Revolution was the production of novel wheat cultivars. Agronomists bred high-yielding varieties of corn, wheat, and rice. HYVs have higher nitrogen-absorbing potential than other varieties. Since cereals that absorbed extra nitrogen would typically lodge, or fall over before harvest, semi-dwarfing genes were bred into their genomes. A Japanese dwarf wheat cultivar Norin 10 developed by Japanese agronomist Gonjiro Inazuka, which was sent to Orville Vogel at Washington State University by Cecil Salmon, was instrumental in developing Green Revolution wheat cultivars. In the 1960s, with a food crisis in Asia, the spread of high-yielding variety rice greatly increased.

Dr. Norman Borlaug, the &quot;Father of the Green Revolution&quot;, bred rust-resistant cultivars which have strong and firm stems, preventing them from falling over under extreme weather at high levels of fertilization. CIMMYT (Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y TrigoInternational Center for Maize and Wheat Improvements) conducted these breeding programs and helped spread high-yielding varieties in Mexico and countries in Asia like India and Pakistan. These programs led to the doubling of harvests in these countries.

Plant scientists figured out several parameters related to the high yield and identified the related genes which control the plant height and tiller number. With advances in molecular genetics, the mutant genes responsible for &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; genes (GA 20-oxidase, &quot;ga1&quot;, &quot;ga1-3&quot;), wheat reduced-height genes (&quot;Rht&quot;) and a rice semidwarf gene (&quot;sd1&quot;) were cloned. These were identified as gibberellin biosynthesis genes or cellular signaling component genes. Stem growth in the mutant background is significantly reduced leading to the dwarf phenotype. Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield.

High-yielding varieties significantly outperform traditional varieties in the presence of adequate irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers. In the absence of these inputs, traditional varieties may outperform high-yielding varieties. Therefore, several authors have challenged the apparent superiority of high-yielding varieties not only compared to the traditional varieties alone, but by contrasting the monocultural system associated with high-yielding varieties with the polycultural system associated with traditional ones.

===Production increases===

By one 2021 estimate, the Green Revolution increased yields by 44% between 1965 and 2010. Cereal production more than doubled in developing nations between the years 1961–1985. Yields of rice, corn, and wheat increased steadily during that period. The production increases can be attributed equal to irrigation, fertilizer, and seed development, at least in the case of Asian rice.

While agricultural output increased as a result of the Green Revolution, the energy input to produce a crop has increased faster, so that the ratio of crops produced to energy input has decreased over time. Green Revolution techniques also heavily rely on agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and defoliants; which, as of 2014, are derived from crude oil, making agriculture increasingly reliant on crude oil extraction. 
===Effects on food security===

The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation. The development of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has significantly supported global population growth — it has been estimated that almost half the people on the Earth are currently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use. According to ICIS Fertilizers managing editor Julia Meehan, &quot;People don&#x27;t realise that 50% of the world&#x27;s food relies on fertilisers.&quot;

The world population has grown by about five billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution. India saw annual wheat production rise from 10 million tons in the 1960s to 73 million in 2006. The average person in the developing world consumes roughly 25% more calories per day now than before the Green Revolution. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by 160%.

The production increases fostered by the Green Revolution are often credited with having helped to avoid widespread famine, and for feeding billions of people.

===Food security===
====Malthusian criticism====
Some criticisms generally involve some variation of the Malthusian principle of population. Such concerns often revolve around the idea that the Green Revolution is unsustainable, and argue that humanity is now in a state of overpopulation or overshoot with regards to the sustainable carrying capacity and ecological demands on the Earth. A 2021 study found, contrary to the expectations of the Malthusian hypothesis, that the Green Revolution led to reduced population growth, rather than an increase in population growth.

Although many people die each year as a direct or indirect result of hunger and poor nutrition, Malthus&#x27;s more extreme predictions have failed to materialize. In 1798 Thomas Malthus made his prediction of impending famine. The world&#x27;s population had doubled by 1923 and doubled again by 1973 without fulfilling Malthus&#x27;s prediction. Malthusian Paul R. Ehrlich, in his 1968 book &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;, said that &quot;India couldn&#x27;t possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980&quot; and &quot;Hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs.&quot; Ehrlich&#x27;s warnings failed to materialize when India became self-sustaining in cereal production in 1974 (six years later) as a result of the introduction of Norman Borlaug&#x27;s dwarf wheat varieties.

However, Borlaug was well aware of the implications of population growth. In his Nobel lecture he repeatedly presented improvements in food production within a sober understanding of the context of population. &quot;The green revolution has won a temporary success in man&#x27;s war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only. Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the &quot;Population Monster&quot;...Since man is potentially a rational being, however, I am confident that within the next two decades he will recognize the self-destructive course he steers along the road of irresponsible population growth...&quot;

====Famine====
To some modern Western sociologists and writers, increasing food production is not synonymous with increasing food security, and is only part of a larger equation. For example, Harvard professor Amartya Sen wrote that large historic famines were not caused by decreases in food supply, but by socioeconomic dynamics and a failure of public action. Economist Peter Bowbrick disputes Sen&#x27;s theory, arguing that Sen relies on inconsistent arguments and contradicts available information, including sources that Sen himself cited. Bowbrick further argues that Sen&#x27;s views coincide with that of the Bengal government at the time of the Bengal famine of 1943, and the policies Sen advocates failed to relieve the famine.

====Quality of diet====

Some have challenged the value of the increased food production of Green Revolution agriculture. These monoculture crops are often used for export, feed for animals, or conversion into biofuel. According to Emile Frison of Bioversity International, the Green Revolution has also led to a change in dietary habits, as fewer people are affected by hunger and die from starvation, but many are affected by malnutrition such as iron or vitamin-A deficiencies. Frison further asserts that almost 60% of yearly deaths of children under age five in developing countries are related to malnutrition.

The strategies developed by the Green Revolution focused on fending off starvation and were very successful in raising overall yields of cereal grains, but did not give sufficient relevance to nutritional quality. High yield cereal crops have low quality proteins, with essential amino acid deficiencies, are high in carbohydrates, and lack balanced essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and other quality factors.

High-yield rice, introduced since 1964 to poverty-ridden Asian countries, such as the Philippines, was found to have inferior flavor and be more glutinous and less savory than their native varieties, causing its price to be lower than the average market value.

In the Philippines the heavy use of pesticides in rice production, in the early part of the Green Revolution, poisoned and killed off fish and weedy green vegetables that traditionally coexisted in rice paddies. These were nutritious food sources for many poor Filipino farmers prior to the introduction of pesticides, further impacting the diets of locals.

===Socioeconomic impacts===

According to a 2021 study, the Green Revolution substantially increased income. A delay in the Green Revolution by ten years would have cost 17% of GDP per capita, whereas if the Green Revolution had never happened, it could have reduced GDP per capita in the developing world by half.

===Environmental impact===

====Biodiversity====
There are varying opinions about the effect of the Green Revolution on wild biodiversity. One hypothesis speculates that by increasing production per unit of land area, agriculture will not need to expand into new, uncultivated areas to feed a growing human population. However, land degradation and soil nutrients depletion have forced farmers to clear forested areas in order to maintain production. A counter-hypothesis speculates that biodiversity was sacrificed because traditional systems of agriculture that were displaced sometimes incorporated practices to preserve wild biodiversity, and because the Green Revolution expanded agricultural development into new areas where it was once unprofitable or too arid. For example, the development of wheat varieties tolerant to acid soil conditions with high aluminium content permitted the introduction of agriculture in the Cerrado semi-humid tropical savanna. 

The world community has clearly acknowledged the negative aspects of agricultural expansion as the 1992 Rio Treaty, signed by 189 nations, has generated numerous national Biodiversity Action Plans which assign significant biodiversity loss to agriculture&#x27;s expansion into new domains.

The Green Revolution has been criticized for an agricultural model which relied on a few staple and market profitable crops, and pursuing a model which limited the biodiversity of Mexico. One of the critics against these techniques and the Green Revolution as a whole was Carl O. Sauer, a geography professor at the University of California, Berkeley. According to Sauer these techniques of plant breeding would result in negative effects on the country&#x27;s resources, and the culture:
A good aggressive bunch of American agronomists and plant breeders could ruin the native resources for good and all by pushing their American commercial stocks... And Mexican agriculture cannot be pointed toward standardization on a few commercial types without upsetting native economy and culture hopelessly... Unless the Americans understand that, they&#x27;d better keep out of this country entirely. That must be approached from an appreciation of native economies as being basically sound.
==== Greenhouse gas emissions ====
Studies indicate that the Green Revolution has substantially increased emissions of the greenhouse gas . High yield agriculture has dramatic effects on the amount of carbon cycling in the atmosphere. The way in which farms are grown, in tandem with the seasonal carbon cycling of various crops, could alter the impact carbon in the atmosphere has on global warming. Wheat, rice, and soybean crops account for a significant amount of the increase in carbon in the atmosphere over the last 50 years. 

Poorly regulated applications of nitrogen fertilizer that exceed the amount used by plants, such as broadcast applications of urea, result in emissions of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, and in water pollution. As the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Michael Fakhri summarized in 2022, &quot;food systems emit approximately one third of the world’s greenhouse gases and contribute to the alarming decline in the number of animal and plant species. Intensive industrial agriculture and export-oriented food policies have driven much of this damage. Ever since governments started adopting the Green Revolution in the 1950s, the world&#x27;s food systems have been increasingly designed along industrial models, the idea being that, if people are able to purchase industrial inputs, then they can produce a large amount of food. Productivity was not measured in terms of human and environmental health, but exclusively in terms of commodity output and economic growth. This same system disrupted carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles because it requires farmers to depend on fossil fuel- based machines and chemical inputs, displacing long-standing regenerative and integrated farming practices.&quot; The IPCC&#x27;s synthesis of recent findings states similarly &quot;intensive agriculture during the second half of the 20th century led to soil degradation and loss of natural resources and contributed to climate change.&quot; They further specify, &quot;while the Green Revolution technologies substantially increased the yield of few crops and allowed countries to reduce hunger, they also resulted in inappropriate and excessive use of agrochemicals, inefficient water use, loss of beneficial biodiversity, water and soil pollution and significantly reduced crop and varietal diversity.&quot;

==== Land use ====
A 2021 study found that the Green Revolution led to a reduction in land used for agriculture.

===Health impact===
Studies have found that the Green Revolution substantially reduced infant mortality in the developing world. A 2020 study of 37 developing countries found that the diffusion of modern crop varieties &quot;reduced infant mortality by 2.4–5.3 percentage points (from a baseline of 18%), with stronger effects for male infants and among poor households.&quot; Another 2020 study found that high yield crop varieties reduced infant mortality in India, with particularly large effects for rural children, boys and low-caste children.

Consumption of pesticides and fertilizer agrochemicals associated with the Green Revolution may have adverse health impacts. For example, pesticides may increase the likelihood of cancer. Poor farming practices including non-compliance to usage of masks and over-usage of the chemicals compound this situation. In 1989, WHO and UNEP estimated that there were around 1 million human pesticide poisonings annually. Some 20,000 (mostly in developing countries) ended in death, as a result of poor labeling, loose safety standards etc. A 2014 study found that Indian children who were exposed to higher quantities of fertilizer agrochemicals experienced more adverse health impacts.

==Second Green Revolution==

Although the Green Revolution has been able to improve agricultural output briefly in some regions in the world, its yield rates have been declining, while its social and environmental costs become more clearly apparent. As a result, many organizations continue to invent new ways to rectify, significantly augment or replace the techniques already used in the Green Revolution. Frequently quoted inventions are the System of Rice Intensification, marker-assisted selection, agroecology, and applying existing technologies to agricultural problems of the developing world. It is projected that global populations by 2050 will increase by one-third and as such will require a 70% increase in the production of food, which can be achieved with the right policies and investments. 

=== Evergreen Revolution ===
The term &#x27;Evergreen Revolution&#x27; was coined by Indian agricultural scientist M. S. Swaminathan in 1990, though he has stated that the concept dates back to as early as 1968. It aims to represent an added dimension to the original concepts and practices of the green revolution, the ecological dimension. Swaminathan has described it as &quot;productivity in perpetuity without associated ecological harm&quot;. The concept has evolved into a combination of science, economics, and sociology. In 2002, American biologist E.O. Wilson observed that: 

However, despite Swaminathan&#x27;s prominent role in India&#x27;s adoption of Green Revolution agriculture, the &#x27;Evergreen&#x27; concept largely reflects the failures of the original project. Although a relatively lesser known term, its substance largely reflects the consensus positions outlined in recent IPCC and other synthetic reports.

<text>The World Summit on Sustainable Development 2002, took place in South Africa, from 26 August to 4 September 2002. It was convened to discuss sustainable development organizations, 10 years after the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. (It was therefore also informally nicknamed &quot;Rio 10&quot;.)

==Declarations==
The Johannesburg Declaration was the main outcome of the Summit; however, there were several other international agreements.

It laid out the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation as an action plan.

==Agreements==
Johannesburg, 27 August: agreement was made to restore the world&#x27;s depleted fisheries for 2015. It was agreed to by negotiators at the World Summit.

Instead of new agreements between governments, the Earth Summit was organized mostly around almost 300 &quot;partnership initiatives&quot; known as Type II, as opposed to Type I Partnerships which are the more classic outcome of international treaties. These were to be the key means to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. These are kept in a database of Partnerships for Sustainable Development.

==U.S. participation==
The absence of the United States rendered the summit partially impotent. George W. Bush boycotted the summit and did not attend. Except for a brief appearance by Colin Powell, who hurriedly addressed the closing stages of the conference while his airplane taxied on the runway of Johannesburg International, the US government did not send a delegation, earning Bush praise in a letter from conservative organizations such as Americans for Tax Reform, American Enterprise Institute, and Competitive Enterprise Institute.

==History==

The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, was first held in Stockholm, Sweden, in June 1972, and marked the emergence of international environmental law. The Declaration on the Human Environment also known as the Stockholm Declaration set out the principles for various international environmental issues, including human rights, natural resource management, pollution prevention and the relationship between the environment and development. The conference also led to the creation of the United Nations Environment Programme.

The Brundtland Commission set up by Gro Harlem Brundtland, the pioneer of sustainable development, provided the momentum for first Earth Summit 1992 – the United Nations Conference on Environmental Development (UNCED), that was also headed by Maurice Strong, who had been a prominent member of the Brundtland Commission – and also for Agenda 21.

South Africa&#x27;s first National Conference on Environment and Development entitled, &quot;Ecologise Politics, Politicise Ecology&quot; was held at the University of the Western Cape in conjunction with the Cape Town Ecology Group and the Western Cape Branch of the World Conference on Religion and Peace in 1991. Prominent persons involved in this conference were Ebrahim Rasool, Cheryl Carolus, Faried Esack, and Julia Martin.

The initial informal discussions on a possible new Summit in 2002 were held in February 1998 and hosted by Derek Osborn who co-chaired the preparatory meetings for Rio+5 and Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future. A set of 10 governments started working informally to start putting together the possible agenda for a Summit. the non-papers produced in 1998 and 1999 ensured that when the UN Commission met in 2000 it could agree to host another Summit in 2002.

<text>William Harvey Carney (February 29, 1840 – December 9, 1908) was an American soldier during the American Civil War. Born enslaved, he was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1900 for his gallantry in saving the regimental colors during the Battle of Fort Wagner in 1863. The action for which he received the Medal of Honor preceded that of any other African American Medal of Honor recipient; however, his medal was actually one of the last to be awarded for Civil War service. Some African Americans received the Medal of Honor as early as April 1865.

==Biography==
William Harvey Carney was born as a slave in Norfolk, Virginia, on February 29, 1840. How he made his way to freedom is not certain. According to most accounts, he escaped through the Underground Railroad, and joined his father in Massachusetts. Other members of their family were freed by purchase or by the death of their master.

=== Civil War ===

Carney joined the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry in March 1863 and was later promoted to sergeant due to his heroism and actions during the battle of Fort Wagner.

He took part in the July 18, 1863, assault on Fort Wagner in Charleston, South Carolina. His actions there ultimately earned him the Medal of Honor. When the color guard was killed, Carney retrieved the U.S. flag and marched forward with it, despite serious wounds. When the Union troops were forced to retreat under fire, he struggled back across the battlefield (he was shot in both his right arm and leg as well as his chest, with the last shot fired barely hitting his head), and, eventually returning to his own lines and turning over the colors to another survivor of the 54th, saying, &quot;Boys, I only did my duty; the old flag never touched the ground!&quot;

He received an honorable discharge due to disability from his wounds in June 1864.

===Post-war===

After his discharge, Carney returned to New Bedford, Massachusetts, and took a job maintaining the city&#x27;s streetlights. He then delivered mail for 32 years. He was a founding vice president of the New Bedford Branch 18 of the National Association of Letter Carriers, in 1890. He married Susannah Williams, and they had a daughter, Clara Heronia. He spent a few years in California, then returned again in 1869.

Carney received his Medal of Honor on May 23, 1900, nearly 37 years after the events at Fort Wagner (more than half of such awards from the Civil War were presented 20 or more years after the fact). 20 African American men received the medal before him, but because his battle actions happened earlier than the others, some have incorrectly cited him as the first to receive the medal. His citation reads:
When the color sergeant was shot down, this soldier grasped the flag, led the way to the parapet, and planted the colors thereon. When the troops fell back he brought off the flag, under a fierce fire in which he was twice severely wounded.

In 1901, shortly after his medal was awarded, a song was published about his daring exploits: &quot;Boys the Old Flag Never Touched the Ground&quot;.

Captain Luis F. Emilio, the most junior captain of the 54th, who had been left in charge during the attack on Battery Wagner by the deaths or wounding of all of his superiors, in his 1891 book &quot;A Brave Black Regiment&quot; wrote: &quot;It is due, however, to the following-named enlisted men that they be recorded above their fellows for especial merit: [1st] Sgt. Robert J. Simmons, [Col.] Sgt. William H. Carney...&quot;

Carney died at the Boston City Hospital on December 9, 1908, of complications from an elevator accident at the Massachusetts State House, where he worked for the Department of State. His body lay in repose for one day at the undertaking rooms of Walden Banks, 142 Lenox Street, at the wish of his wife and daughter. He was buried in the family plot at Oak Grove Cemetery in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Engraved on his tombstone is an image of the Medal of Honor.

==Other honors==
A New Bedford, Massachusetts, elementary school was named in his honor, and his New Bedford home at 128 Mill Street is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
His statue, along with Private Milton L. Olive, is seen on the African-American Medal of Honor Recipients Memorial in Wilmington, Delaware.

Sgt. Carney&#x27;s statue is also prominently featured in his hometown at West Point Cemetery (Norfolk, Virginia), atop a monument to African American Civil War and Spanish American War veterans.

In 2015, Carney was honored as one of the Library of Virginia&#x27;s &quot;Strong Men &amp; Women in Virginia History&quot; because of his actions during the Civil War. Carney&#x27;s regiment is represented in the Memorial to Robert Gould Shaw and the Massachusetts Fifty-Fourth Regiment, located on the Boston Common and designed by Augustus Saint Gaudens.

<text>Cusco or Cuzco (; or , ) is a city in southeastern Peru, near the Sacred Valley of the Andes mountain range and the Huatanay river. It is the capital of the eponymous province and department. The city is the seventh most populous in Peru; in 2017, it had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around .

The city was the capital of the Inca Empire until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title &quot;City of Cusco&quot;. It has become a major tourist destination, hosting over 2 million visitors a year and providing passage to numerous Incan ruins, such as Machu Picchu, one of the Seven modern wonders of the world and others. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates the city as the Historical Capital of Peru.

==Spelling and etymology==
The indigenous name of this city is . Although the name was used in Southern Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase (&#x27;rock of the owl&#x27;), related to the city&#x27;s foundation myth of the Ayar siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa () acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his (&quot;lineage&quot;):

The Spanish conquistadors (Spanish soldiers) adopted the local name, transcribing it according to Spanish phonetics as or, less often, . was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times, though was also used. , pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.

As both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of &#x27;z&#x27; is no longer universally close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new spelling, , in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling more closely related to Quechua, &quot;Qosqo&quot;, but later administrations have not followed suit.

There is no international, official spelling of the city&#x27;s name. In English-language publications both &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot; can be found. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; and &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; prefer &quot;Cuzco&quot;, and in scholarly writings &quot;Cuzco&quot; is used more often than &quot;Cusco&quot;. The city&#x27;s international airport code is CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.

==Symbols==
===Flag===

The official Flag of Cusco consists of seven horizontal stripes in the colors red, orange, yellow, green, sky blue, blue, and violet, representing the rainbow. This flag was introduced in 1973 by Raúl Montesinos Espejo in celebration of the 25th anniversary of his Tawantinsuyo Radio station. Its popularity led to its official adoption by the Municipality of Cusco in 1978. Since 2021, the flag has also included the golden &quot;Sol de Echenique,&quot; a symbol associated with the city&#x27;s historical identity.

===Coat of arms===

The Coat of arms of Cusco was officially adopted in 1986 and is used by the city, province, and region of Cusco. The coat of arms incorporates elements from both Inca and Spanish heraldry. Historically, the city&#x27;s arms included a golden castle on a red field with eight condors surrounding it. The modern design, officially adopted in 1986, features the Sol de Echenique, a golden sun emblem, as the central element, symbolizing the city&#x27;s connection to its Inca heritage.

===Anthem===

The Anthem of Cusco was composed by Roberto Ojeda Campana with lyrics by Luis Nieto Miranda in 1944. It was officially adopted as the city&#x27;s anthem and has been sung at public events since then. In 1991, the anthem was translated into Quechua by Faustino Espinoza Navarro and Mario Mejía Waman. The anthem is performed in both Spanish and Quechua, reflecting the city&#x27;s cultural diversity and historical significance. In 2019, the Municipality of Cusco declared the performance of the anthem in Quechua at civic events to be of public interest and historical importance.

==History==

=== Killke culture ===

The Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 AD, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 AD. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.

===Inca period===

Cusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century – 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the &quot;hurin&quot; and &quot;hanan&quot;. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.

Each local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.

According to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cusco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of &quot;Tawantinsuyu&quot;. Archeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.

The city fell to the sphere of Huáscar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1528. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see Battle of Cuzco), and gained control.

===Spanish period===

The first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa&#x27;s Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. &quot;The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.&quot; The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since &quot;each sovereign built a new palace for himself.&quot; &quot;The delicacy of the stone work excelled&quot; that of the Spaniards&#x27;. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of &quot;heavy masses of rock&quot;. &quot;Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,&quot; including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.

Pizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos, or land grants to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.
Pizarro renamed it as the &quot;very noble and great city of Cuzco&quot;. Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.

Father Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He supported construction of the Dominican Order monastery (Santo Domingo Convent) on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.

During the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca, he took control of the city from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco&#x27;s forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State. There his state survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.

Cusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former Inca Empire) was built on Killke structures. The Spanish replaced indigenous temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.

Cusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and archdiocese.


===Present===

A major earthquake on 21 May 1950 damaged more than one third of the city&#x27;s structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive &quot;Qurikancha&quot; (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the &quot;Qurikancha&quot; were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.

In the 1990s, during the mayoral administration of Mayor Daniel Estrada Pérez, the city underwent a new process of beautification through the restoration of monuments and the construction of plazas, fountains and monuments. Likewise, thanks to the efforts of this authority, various recognitions were achieved, such as the declaration as &quot;Historical Capital of Peru&quot; contained in the text of the Political Constitution of Peru of 1993. It was also decided to change the coat of arms of Cusco, leaving aside the colonial coat of arms and adopting the &quot;Sol de Echenique&quot; as the new coat of arms. Additionally, the change of the official name of the city was proposed to adopt the Quechua word &quot;Qosqo&quot;, but this change was reversed a few years later. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada Pérez, a staunch supporter of the &quot;Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua&quot;, between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name &quot;Qosqo&quot; was officially adopted for the city. Tourism in the city was drastically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru and the 2022–2023 Peruvian protests, with the latter event costing the area 10 million soles daily.

==Geography==
=== Location ===
Cusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around . To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay () about northwest of Cusco.

===Climate===
Cusco has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs from April through September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of . Summer occurs from October through March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month, averaging . Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from , but the all-time temperature range is between . Sunshine hours peak in July, the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least sunshine.

In 2006, Cusco was found to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.

== Government ==
Throughout its history, Cusco has had a marked political importance. During the Inca period, it was the main political center of the region from which the Inca Empire was ruled and where the political and religious elite lived. After its Spanish foundation, it lost prominence due to Francisco Pizarro&#x27;s decision to establish the capital of the new territories in the city of Lima because it had close access to the sea and communication with the metropolis. However, Cusco continued to be an important city within the viceregal political scheme to the point of being the first city in the entire Viceroyalty to have a bishop. Its participation in the trade routes during the viceroyalty guaranteed its political importance as it remained the capital of the corregimiento established in these territories and, later, of the Intendancy of Cusco and, towards the end of the viceroyalty, of the Royal Audience of Cusco.

During the republic, Cusco&#x27;s political role languished due to its isolation from the capital, coastline, and trade routes of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, it maintained its status as the main city in southern Peru, although subordinated to the importance that Arequipa was gaining, better connected with the rest of the country. Cusco has always remained the capital of the department of Cusco

Politically, according to the results of elections held in the second half of the 20th century, Cusco has been a stronghold of leftist parties in Peru. In the 1970s and 1980s, the socialist leader Daniel Estrada Pérez brought together this political tendency under the banner of the United Left alliance. Since his death, Cusco has been a major city for parties such as the Peruvian Nationalist Party and the Broad Front for Justice, Life and Liberty, as well as regional movements. Traditional Peruvian parties, such as the Peruvian Aprista Party and Acción Popular, have recorded eventual electoral victories, while those that represent a right-wing political position, such as the Popular Christian Party and Fujimorism itself, have had little presence among the elected authorities.

== Demographics ==
The city had a population of about 348,935 people in 2007 and 428,450 people in 2017 according to INEI.


== Economy ==
Economic activity in Cuzco includes agriculture, especially maize and native tubers. The local industry is related to extractive activities and to food and beverage products, such as beer, carbonated waters, coffee, chocolates, among others. However, the relevant economic activity of its inhabitants is the reception of tourism, with increasingly better infrastructure and services. It is the second city in this country that has and maintains full employment.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism has been the backbone to the Cusco economy since the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2019, Cusco was the region that reached the highest number of tourists in Peru with more than 2.7 million tourists. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion. Most tourists visiting the city are there to tour the city and the Incan Ruins, especially the top destination, Machu Picchu, which is one of the New Seven Modern Wonders of the World.

In order to keep up with tourist demand, the city is constructing a new airport in Chinchero known as Chinchero International Airport. Its main purpose is for tourists to bypass lay overs through Lima and connect the city to Europe and North America. It will replace the old airport, Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.

== Culture ==
=== Architecture ===
Due to its antiquity and significance, the center of the city preserves many buildings, squares and streets from pre-Columbian times as well as colonial constructions. That is why the city was declared in 1972 &quot;as &quot;Cultural Heritage of the Nation&quot;&quot; by Supreme Resolution No. 2900-72-ED.In 1983, during the VII session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, it was decided to declare this area as a World Heritage Site by establishing a central zone that constitutes the World Heritage Site proper and a buffer zone.

One of the characteristics that the Incas achieved with their urban plan in Cusco was the respect for the geographical matrix when building their fabric, since they responded with different design strategies to the rugged topography of the Andean area at 3399 meters above sea level

=== Language ===
The native language is Quechua, although the city&#x27;s inhabitants mostly speak Spanish. The Quechua people are the last living descendants of the Inca Empire. 
===Museums===
Cusco has the following important museums:

*Museo de Arte Precolombino
*Casa Concha Museum (Machu Picchu Museum)
*Museo Inka
*Museo Histórico Regional de Cuzco
*Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cuzco or Center of the Traditional Textiles of Cusco in English
*Museum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants (&quot;Museo de plantas sagradas, mágicas y medicinales&quot;)
*ChocoMuseo (The Cacao and Chocolate Museum)
There are also some museums located at churches, like the and the Museum of Qoricancha Temple
=== Religion ===

The most common practiced religion in Cusco is Catholicism. The Inca religion is also practiced by the Quechua people. Cusco hosts the great mass ceremonies and imperial festivities, such as the Inti Raymi or Festival of the Sun, which continues to take place during the winter solstice – the solar new year – which is celebrated every 24th of June on the esplanade of Sacsayhuamán.

Currently, the majority of the population belongs to the Catholic Church, with Cuzco being the archbishopric.

=== Media ===
In Cusco, the mass media is essential for addressing local issues, educating the public, and conserving cultural heritage. Media outlets in the city that serve both Spanish-speaking and Quechua-speaking communities include newspapers, radio, television, and digital platforms. Local news, culture, tourism, and indigenous rights are the main topics of media outlets in Cusco, a historic and popular tourist destination.

Regional coverage is provided by newspapers like &quot;Diario del Cusco&quot; and &quot;Diario El Sol del Cusco (El Sol)&quot;, while national publications like &quot;El Comercio&quot; and &quot;La República&quot; also cover social, political, and economic issues in Cusco. Indigenous communities are largely reached by Quechua-language media, like Cronicawan, which guarantees greater access to news and cultural preservation.

With stations like Radio Tawantinsuyo and Radio Universal transmitting talk shows, music, and news, radio is still a dominant medium. Regional news can be found on local television channels, and Cusqueños are increasingly using digital platforms, such as social media and online news portals.

=== Cuisine ===
As capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients. Cuy (guinea pig), a native animal in Cusco, is a popular dish in the city.
The local gastronomy presents a diversified array of dishes resulting from the mestizaje and fusion of its pre-Inca, Inca, colonial, and modern traditions. It is a variation of Andean Peruvian cuisine, although it maintains some typical cultural traits of southern Peru.
Although the list of typical dishes may vary among individuals, Tapia and García present a list of foods and beverages usually found in a Cusco picantería:

==== Chiri Uchu ====

&quot;Chiri Uchu&quot; is a typical dish of the locality not offered in picanterías, as it is consumed in June during the Cusco festivities of Inti Raymi and, primarily, during the Corpus Christi. It is considered one of the most authentic gastronomic expressions of Cusco as it blends both native flavors of the Andes and those brought by the Spanish conquistadors. It is a cold dish that includes various meats (cuy, boiled chicken, charqui, morcilla (blood sausage), salchicha (sausage)), potatoes, cheese, corn cake, fish roe, and lake algae.

=== Music ===
====Centro Qosqo de Arte Nativo====

A folkloric institution established in 1924. It is considered the most important folkloric institution in the city and was recognized by the Peruvian government as the first folkloric institution in the country and by the regional government as a Living Cultural Heritage of the Cusco region.

====Cusco Symphony Orchestra====
It is a permanent artistic group of the Decentralized Directorate of Culture of the Cusco Regional Government, created by Directoral Resolution No. 021/INC-Cusco on March 10, 2009. It performs more than 50 concerts a year and uses the Cusco Municipal Theater.

=== Sport ===

Among other events, the Cusco was a venue for the 2004 Copa América, hosting the third-place match between the Colombia and Uruguay national teams.

The most popular sport in the city is football (soccer), with three main clubs. Cienciano participates in the Liga 1 (First Division) and is the only Peruvian club to win an international tournament, winning the 2003 Copa Sudamericana and 2004 Recopa Sudamericana.

Another historic team is Deportivo Garcilaso, which was promoted to Liga 1 after winning the Copa Perú 2022. There is also Cusco Football Club, formerly known as Real Garcilaso, which played in the First Division from 2012 to 2021 after winning the Copa Perú in 2011. In 2022, it was promoted again to Liga 1 after winning the Second Division of Peru.

=== Cinema ===
The International Short Film Festival (FENACO) was an important international film festival in southern Peru, held every November since 2004 in the imperial city of Cusco.
Originally, it was a national event dedicated to the short film format (up to 30 minutes in length), with international showcases, hence its name FENACO (&quot;Festival Internacional de Cortometrajes&quot;), a name popularized in Peru and worldwide to recognize the festival. However, due to the reception and response from filmmakers, producers, and distributors from different countries, it evolved into an international festival, reaching 354 short films in competition from 37 countries in its sixth edition.

==Main sites==
The indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuamán about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Sacsayhuamán was expanded by the Inca.

The Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo.

The major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti&#x27;s presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the &quot;fortress&quot; at Ollantaytambo.

Less-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at ; Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at Ñusta Hisp&#x27;ana (aka Chuqip&#x27;allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tipón, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik&#x27;iraw, Moray, Vitcos and many others.

The surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.

=== Architectural heritage ===
Because of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:

==== &quot;Barrio de San Blas&quot; ====
This neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.

The Quechua name of this neighborhood is &quot;Tuq&#x27;ukachi&quot;, which means the opening of the salt.

==== Hatun Rumiyuq ====
This street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (&quot;the one with the big stone&quot;) was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop&#x27;s residence.

Along this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city&#x27;s history.
==== Basílica de la Merced ====

Its foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.

Its cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.

Also on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs and is in height.

==== Cathedral ====

The first cathedral built in Cusco is the &quot;Iglesia del Triunfo&quot;, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.

The main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.

This great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.

The city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the &quot;Cuzco School&quot; and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.

The cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.
==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====
Known as the &quot;Square of the warrior&quot; in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of Túpac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance. The Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compañía both open directly onto the plaza.

The cast iron fountain in Plaza de Armas was manufactured by Janes, Beebe &amp; Co.

====&quot;Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús&quot;====

This church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the &quot;Amarucancha&quot; or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.

Its façade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.

==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====
The Qurikancha (&quot;golden place&quot;) was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God – Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.

The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.

With this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.

Inside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transport ===
==== Air ====

Cusco&#x27;s main international airport is Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport, which provides service to 5 domestic destinations and 3 international ones. It is named in honor of Peruvian pilot Alejandro Velasco Astete who was the first person to fly across the Andes in 1925 when he made the first flight from Lima to Cusco. The airport is the second busiest in Peru after Lima&#x27;s Jorge Chávez International Airport. It will soon be replaced by Chinchero International Airport. which will provide access to North American and Europe.

==== Rail ====
Cusco is connected by rail to the cities of Juliaca and Arequipa through the Southern Section of the Southern Railway, whose terminus in the city is the Wánchaq station. Additionally, from the San Pedro station, the South East Section of the Southern Railroad (former &quot;Cusco-Santa Ana-Quillabamba Railway&quot;) departs from the city, which is the route to the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu. PeruRail is the largest Peruvian railway company and provides service to stations in Cusco.

==== Road ====
By road, it is connected to the cities of Puerto Maldonado, Arequipa, Abancay, Juliaca and Puno. The road that connects it with the city of Abancay is also the fastest to reach Lima after a journey of more than 20 hours crossing the departments of Apurímac, Ayacucho, Ica and Lima.

===Healthcare===

Cusco, as the administrative and economic center of the region, hosts numerous public and private health facilities. Public healthcare is provided by the Ministry of Health, including the Regional Hospital and Hospital Antonio Lorena.

<text>A slave name is the personal name given by others to an enslaved person, or a name inherited from enslaved ancestors. 

== Ancient Rome==

In Rome, slaves were given a single name by their owner. A slave who was freed might keep his or her slave name and adopt the former owner&#x27;s name as a praenomen and nomen. As an example, one historian says that &quot;a man named Publius Larcius freed a male slave named Nicia, who was then called Publius Larcius Nicia.&quot;

Historian Harold Whetstone Johnston writes of instances in which a slave&#x27;s former owner chose to ignore custom and simply chose a name for the freedman.

== Middle East ==
By Islamic law, non-Muslim foreigners (kafir) were by definition legitimate targets for enslavement, since the Muslim world of dar al-Islam was by definition at war with the non-Muslim world of dar al-harb (&quot;House of War&quot;), and non-Muslim war captives were legitimate to enslave.
After capture, non-Muslim slaves were normally converted to Islam and given a new name. 

In the Ottoman Imperial Harem during the era of slavery in the Ottoman Empire, for example, the new cariye slave girls and concubines (sex slaves) were upon arrival customarily converted to Islam and given a new name, typically a Persian or Turkish name signifying the name of a flower or a bird, such as for example &quot;Nilüfer&quot; (&#x27;water lily&#x27;). Since a person in Ottoman society was normally referred to by the name of their father after their personal name, female slaves, whose fathers where unknown and not Muslims, were given a paternal name associated with God, normally Abdallah: according to preserved records, 97 percent of female palace slaves at the Ottoman Imperial Harem were named &quot;bint&quot; (&#x27;daughter of&#x27;) &quot;Abdallah&quot;.

Example of this were Gülbahar Hatun (mother of Selim I). The discovery of inscriptions (&quot;vakfiye&quot;) and others documents, where she was called &quot;Ayşe Gülbahar bint Abdüllah&quot;, proves that she had Christian slave origins, since this is the traditional slave name by which slaves who converted to Islam were indicated.

==United States==

After they became free, African-American former slaves were free to choose their own names. Many chose names like &quot;Freeman&quot; to denote their new status, while others picked names of famous people or people they admired, such as US Presidents like George Washington. Other commonly chosen names were &quot;Johnson&quot;, &quot;Brown&quot; and &quot;Williams&quot;, which had been popular before emancipation.

There is a common misconception in the United States that African Americans derive their last names from the owners of their enslaved ancestors. For example, in his 1965 book, &quot;Message to the Blackman in America&quot;, Elijah Muhammad wrote, &quot;You must remember that slave-names will keep you a slave in the eyes of the civilized world today. You have seen, and recently, that Africa and Asia will not honor you or give you any respect as long as you are called by the white man&#x27;s name.&quot;

Echoing this, Malcolm X said: 

As a result, some organizations, including Muhammad&#x27;s Nation of Islam and the black nationalist US Organization encourage African Americans to abandon their slave names. In reality some ex-slaves did choose to take the name of their former owner, but generally that was not the case.

Some African-Americans would later change their name after a religious conversion (Muhammad Ali changed his name from Cassius Clay, el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz (Malcolm X) from Malcolm Little, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar from Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr, and Louis Farrakhan changed his from Louis Eugene Walcott, for example) or involvement with the black nationalist movement, in this latter case usually adopting names of African origin (e.g., Amiri Baraka and Assata Shakur).

==Other references==
Irish singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor stated in 2017 that she had changed her legal name to Magda Davitt, saying in an interview that she wished to be &quot;free of the patriarchal slave names.&quot; On her conversion to Islam in 2018, she adopted the Muslim name Shuhada&#x27; Sadaqat.

<doc id="72741" wikidata="Q92744" url="?curid=72741" title="Kristen Nygaard">
<text>Kristen Nygaard (27 August 1926 – 10 August 2002) was a Norwegian computer scientist, programming language pioneer, and politician. Internationally, Nygaard is acknowledged as the co-inventor of object-oriented programming and the programming language Simula with Ole-Johan Dahl in the 1960s. Nygaard and Dahl received the 2001 A. M. Turing Award for their contribution to computer science.

==Early life and career==
Nygaard was born in Oslo and received his master&#x27;s degree in mathematics at the University of Oslo in 1956. His thesis on abstract probability theory was entitled &quot;Theoretical Aspects of Monte Carlo methods&quot;.

Nygaard worked full-time at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment from 1948 to 1960, in computing and programming (1948–1954) and operational research (1952–1960).

From 1957 to 1960, he was head of the first operations research groups in the Norwegian defense establishment. He was cofounder and first chairman of the Norwegian Operational Research Society (1959–1964). In 1960, he was hired by the Norwegian Computing Center (NCC), responsible for building up the NCC as a research institute in the 1960s, becoming its Director of Research in 1962.

==Object-oriented programming==
With Ole-Johan Dahl, he developed the initial ideas for object-oriented programming (OOP) in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center (Norsk Regnesentral (NR)) as part of the Simula I (1961–1965) and Simula 67 (1965–1968) simulation programming languages, which began as an extended variant and superset of ALGOL 60. The languages introduced the core concepts of object-oriented programming: objects, classes, inheritance, virtual quantities, and multi-threaded (quasi-parallel) program execution. In 2004, the Association Internationale pour les Technologies Objets (AITO) established an annual prize in the name of Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard to honor their pioneering work on object-orientation. This Dahl–Nygaard Prize is awarded annually to two individuals that have made significant technical contributions to the field of object-orientation. The work should be in the spirit of the pioneer conceptual and/or implementation work of Dahl and Nygaard which shaped the present view of object-oriented programming. The prize is presented each year at the ECOOP conference. The prize consists of two awards given to a senior and a junior professional.

He conducted research for Norwegian trade unions on planning, control, and data processing, all evaluated in light of the objectives of organised labour (1971–1973), working together with Olav Terje Bergo. His other research and development work included the social impact of computer technology, and the general system description language DELTA (1973–1975), working with Erik Holbaek-Hanssen and Petter Haandlykken.

Nygaard was a professor at Aarhus University, Denmark (1975–1976) and then became professor emeritus at the University of Oslo (part-time from 1977, full-time 1984–1996). His work in Aarhus and Oslo included research and education in system development and the social impact of computer technology, and became the foundation of the Scandinavian School in System Development, which is closely linked to the field of participatory design.

Starting in 1976, he was engaged in developing and (since 1986) implementing the general object-oriented programming language BETA, together with Bent Bruun Kristensen, Ole Lehrmann Madsen, and Birger Møller-Pedersen. The language is now available on a wide range of computers.

==Later career==
In the first half of the 1980s, Nygaard was chairman of the steering committee of the Scandinavian research program System Development and Profession Oriented Languages (SYDPOL), coordinating research and supporting working groups in system development, language research, and artificial intelligence. Also in the 1980s, he was chairman of the steering committee for the Cost-13 (European Common Market Commission)-financed research project on the extensions of profession-oriented languages necessary when artificial intelligence and information technology are becoming part of professional work.

Nygaard&#x27;s research from 1995 to 1999 was related to distributed systems. He was the leader of General Object-Oriented Distributed Systems (GOODS), a three-year Norwegian Research Council-supported project starting in 1997, aiming at enriching object-oriented languages and system development methods by new basic concepts that make it possible to describe the relation between layered and/or distributed programs and the computer hardware and people carrying out these computer programs. The GOODS team also included Haakon Bryhni, Dag Sjøberg, and Ole Smørdal.

Nygaard&#x27;s final research interests were studies of the introductory teaching of programming, and creating a process-oriented conceptual platform for informatics. These subjects are to be developed in a new research project named Comprehensive Object-Oriented Learning (COOL), together with several international test sites. He was giving lectures and courses on these subjects in Norway and elsewhere. In November 1999, he became chair of an advisory committee on Broadband Communication for the Norwegian Department for Municipal and Regional Affairs. He held a part-time position at Simula Research Laboratory from 2001, when the research institute was opened.

==Recognition==
In June 1990, he received an honorary doctorate from Lund University, Sweden. In June 1991, he became the first individual to be given an honorary doctorate by Aalborg University, Denmark. He became a member of the Norwegian Academy of Sciences.

In October 1990, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility awarded him its Norbert Wiener Award for Social and Professional Responsibility.

In 1999, he and Dahl became the first people to receive the then new Rosing Prize, awarded by the Norwegian Data Association for exceptional professional achievements.

In June 2000, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship for &quot;his originating of object technology concepts&quot; by the Object Management Group, a technical standards group for object-orientation, which maintains several International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards.

In November 2001, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded Nygaard and Dahl the IEEE John von Neumann Medal &quot;For the introduction of the concepts underlying object-oriented programming through the design and implementation of Simula 67&quot;.

In February 2002, he was given, once more with Ole-Johan Dahl, the 2001 A. M. Turing Award by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), with the citation: &quot;For ideas fundamental to the emergence of object-oriented programming, through their design of the programming languages Simula I and Simula 67.&quot;

In August 2000, he was made Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav by then King Harald V of Norway.

==Other activities==
In 1984 and 1985, Nygaard was chairman of the Informatics Committee of the University of Oslo, and active in the design of the university&#x27;s plan for developing research, education and computing and communication facilities at all faculties of the university.

He was the first chairman of the Environment Protection Committee of the Norwegian Association for the Protection of Nature.

He was for 10 years (in the 1970s) Norwegian representative in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) activities on information technology. He has been a member of the Research Committee of the Norwegian Federation of Trade Unions, and cooperated with unions in many countries.

For several years, he was engaged in running an experimental social institution trying new ways to create humane living conditions for socially outcast alcoholics.

Nygaard was active in Norwegian politics. In the mid and late 1960s, he was a member of the National Executive Committee of the Norwegian Liberal Party, and chair of that party&#x27;s Strategy Committee. He was a minor ballot candidate in the 1949 parliamentary election. During the intense political fight before the 1972 referendum on whether Norway should become a member of the European Common Market (later the European Union), he worked as coordinator for the many youth organisations that worked against membership.

From 1971 to 2001, Nygaard was a member of the Labour Party, and a member of their committees on research policies.

In November 1988, he became chair of the Information Committee on Norway and the EEC, in August 1990 reorganized as &quot;Nei til EF&quot; an organization disseminating information about Norway&#x27;s relation to the Common Market, and coordinating the efforts to keep Norway outside. (No to European Union membership for Norway, literally &quot;No to the EU&quot;). In 1993, when the EEC ratified the Maastricht Treaty and became the European Union the organization changed its name to reflect this. &quot;Nei til EF&quot; became the largest political organization in Norway (145,000 members in 1994, from a population of 4 million). Nygaard worked with Anne Enger Lahnstein, leader of the anti-EU Centre Party, in this campaign. In the referendum on 28 November 1994, &quot;Nei til EU&quot; succeeded: 52.2% of the electorate voted &quot;No&quot;, and the voter participation was the highest ever in Norway&#x27;s history: 88.8%. The strategy of the campaign, insisted by Nygaard, was that it had to be &quot;for&quot; something as well as against, i.e., the Scandinavian welfare state Nygaard considered threatened by the Maastricht Agreement.

He resigned as chair in 1995, and was later the chair of the organization&#x27;s strategy committee and a member of its council.

In 1996 and 1997, Nygaard was the coordinator of the efforts to establish The European Anti-Maastricht Movement (TEAM), a cooperative network between national organizations opposing the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (EMU) and the Maastricht Treaty in European countries within and outside the EU. The European Alliance of EU-critical Movements (TEAM) was successfully started 3 March 1997.

==Personal life==
Kristen Nygaard married Johanna Nygaard in 1951. She worked at the Norwegian Agency for Aid to Developing Countries. She specialized for a number of years in recruiting and giving administrative support to specialists working in East Africa. Johanna and Kristen Nygaard had three children and seven grandchildren.

Nygaard died of a heart attack in 2002.

<text>Kumbakonam (formerly spelt as Coombaconum or Combaconum), or Kudanthai, is a city municipal corporation in the Thanjavur district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located from Thanjavur and from Chennai and is the headquarters of the Kumbakonam taluk of Thanjavur district. It is the second largest city in the district after Thanjavur. The city is bounded by two rivers, the Kaveri River to the north and Arasalar River to the south. Kumbakonam is known as a &quot;Temple City&quot; due to the prevalence of a number of temples here and is noted for its Mahamaham festival, which happens once in 12 years, attracting people from all over the country.

Kumbakonam dates back to the Sangam period and was ruled by the Early Cholas, Pallavas, Mutharaiyar dynasty, Medieval Cholas, Later Cholas, Pandyas, the Vijayanagara Empire, Madurai Nayaks, Thanjavur Nayaks and the Thanjavur Marathas. It rose to be a prominent town between the seventh and ninth centuries AD, when it served as a capital of the Medieval Cholas. The city reached the zenith of its prosperity during the British Raj when it was a prominent centre of European education and Hindu culture; and it acquired the cultural name, the &quot;Cambridge of South India&quot;. In 1866, Kumbakonam was officially constituted as a municipality, which today comprises 48 wards, making it the second largest local civil body in Thanjavur district. It became a municipal corporation on 24 August 2021.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Kumbakonam&quot;, roughly translated in English as the &quot;Pot&#x27;s Corner&quot;, is believed to be an allusion to the mythical pot (&quot;kumbha&quot;) of the Hindu god Brahma that contained the seed of all living beings on earth. The &quot;kumbha&quot; is believed to have been displaced by a &quot;pralaya&quot; (dissolution of the universe) and ultimately came to rest at the spot where the town of Kumbakonam now stands. This event is now commemorated in the Mahamaham festival held every 12 years. Kumbakonam is also known as Baskarashetram and Kumbam from time immemorial and as Kudanthai in ancient times. Kumbakonam is also spelt as Coombaconum in the records of British India. Kumbakonam was also formerly known by the Tamil name of Kudamukku. Kumbakonam is also identified with the Sangam age settlement of Kudavayil.

==History==
The region around Kumbakonam was inhabited as early as the Sangam Age (third century BC to third century AD). The present-day Kumbakonam is believed to be the site of the ancient town of Kudavayil where the Early Chola king Karikala held his court. Some scholars identify Kumbakonam as the site of the fabled prison of Kudavayir-kottam where the Chera king Kanaikkal Irumporai was imprisoned by the Early Chola king Kocengannan. Kumbakonam is identified with the town of Malaikūrram which had served as the Chola capital as early as the seventh century and with the town of Solamaligai which had also served as a Chola capital. According to the Sinnamanur plates, Kumbakonam was the site of a battle between the Pallava king Sri Vallabha and the then Pandya king in 859 and between the Pandya king Srimara Pandya and a confederacy of the Cholas and Gangas.

Kumbakonam came into the limelight during the rule of the Medieval Cholas who ruled from the ninth century to the twelfth century. The town of Pazhaiyaarai, from Kumbakonam was the capital of the Chola Empire in the ninth century.

Following the decline of the Chola kingdom, Kumbakonam was conquered by the Pandyas in 1290. Following the demise of the Pandya kingdom in the 14th century, Kumbakonam was conquered by the Vijayanagar Empire. Krishnadevaraya (1509–29), the emperor of Vijayanagara visited the town in 1524 and is believed to have bathed in the famous Mahamaham tank during the Mahamaham festival. Kumbakonam was ruled by the Madurai Nayaks and the Thanjavur Nayaks from 1535 to 1673 when it fell to the Marathas. Each of these dynasties had a considerable impact on the demographics and culture of the region. When the Vijayanagar Empire fell in 1565, there was a mass influx of poets, musicians and cultural artists from the kingdom.
According to the chronicles of the Hindu monastic institution, the Kanchi matha, the &quot;matha&quot; was temporarily transferred to Kumbakonam in the 1780s following an invasion of Kanchipuram by Hyder Ali of Mysore. When Tipu Sultan invaded the east coast of South India in 1784, Kumbakonam bore the brunt of his invasion. The produce fell sharply and the economy collapsed. Kumbakonam did not recover from the calamity until the beginning of the 19th century.
Kumbakonam was eventually ceded to the British East India Company in 1799 by the Thanjavur Maratha ruler Serfoji II (1777–1832) and reached the zenith of its prosperity in the late 19th and early 20th century when it emerged as an important center of Brahminism, Hindu religion and European education in the Madras Presidency. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 fostered trade contacts with the United Kingdom. In 1877, railway lines were completed linking Kumbakonam with the ports of Madras, Tuticorin and Nagapattinam. The Tanjore district court was established in Kumbakonam in 1806 and functioned from 1806 to 1863.

Kumbakonam continued to grow even after India&#x27;s independence though it fell behind the nearby town of Thanjavur in terms of population and administrative importance. The population growth rate began to fall sharply after 1981. This decline has been attributed to limited land area and lack of industrial potential. However the peripheral areas of Kumbakonam population increased as evident from the successive census data. During the Mahamaham festival of 1992, there was a major stampede in which 48 people were killed and 74 were injured. On 16 July 2004, a devastating fire accident in the Sri Krishna school killed 94 children.

<doc id="72745" wikidata="Q184462" url="?curid=72745" title="Croesus">
<text>Croesus ( ; Phrygian: ; ; Latin: ; reigned: )
was the king of Lydia, who reigned from 585 BC until his defeat by the Persian king Cyrus the Great in 547 or 546 BC. According to Herodotus, he reigned 14 years. Croesus was renowned for his wealth; Herodotus and Pausanias noted that his gifts were preserved at Delphi.
The fall of Croesus had a profound effect on the Greeks, providing a fixed point in their calendar. &quot;By the fifth century at least&quot;, J. A. S. Evans has remarked, &quot;Croesus had become a figure of myth, who stood outside the conventional restraints of chronology.&quot;

==Name==
The name of Croesus was not attested in contemporary inscriptions in the Lydian language. In 2019, D. Sasseville and K. Euler published a research of Lydian coins apparently minted during his rule, where the name of the ruler was rendered as &quot;Qλdãns&quot;.

The name comes from the Latin transliteration of the Greek , which was thought by J.M. Kearns to be the ancient Hellenic adaptation of the reconstructed Lydian name . This putative name was analyzed as a compound term consisting of the proper name , of a glide () and of the Lydian term , perhaps meaning &quot;master, lord, noble&quot;. According to J. M. Kearns, Croesus&#x27;s real personal name would have been , while would have been a honorific name meaning &quot;The noble Karoś&quot;.

==Life and reign==
Croesus was born in 620 BC to the king Alyattes of Lydia and one of his queens, a Carian noblewoman whose name is still unknown. Croesus had at least one full sister, Aryenis, as well as a half-brother named Pantaleon, born from an Ionian wife of Alyattes.

Under his father&#x27;s reign, Croesus had been a governor of Adramyttium, which Alyattes had rebuilt as a centre of operations for military actions against the Cimmerians, a nomadic people from the Pontic steppe who had invaded Western Asia, and attacked Lydia over the course of several invasions during which they killed Alyattes&#x27;s great-grandfather Gyges, and possibly his grandfather Ardys and his father Sadyattes. As governor of Adramyttium, Croesus had to provide his father with Ionian Greek mercenaries for a military campaign in Caria.

During Croesus&#x27;s tenure as governor of Adramyttium itself, a rivalry had developed between him and his step-brother Pantaleon, who might have been intended by Alyattes to be his successor. Following Alyattes&#x27;s death in 585 BC, this rivalry became an open succession struggle out of which Croesus emerged victorious.

===Conquests===
Once Croesus&#x27;s position as king was secure, he immediately launched a military campaign against the Ionian city of Ephesus. The ruling dynasty of Ephesus had engaged in friendly relations with Lydia consolidated by diplomatic marriages from the reign of Gyges until that of Alyattes: the Ephesian tyrant Pindar, who had previously supported Pantaleon in the Lydian succession struggle, was the son of a daughter of Alyattes, and was thus a nephew of Croesus. After Pindar rejected an envoy by Croesus demanding Ephesus to submit to Lydia, the Lydian king started to pressure the city and demanded that Pindar leave it and go into exile. After Pindar accepted these terms, Croesus annexed Ephesus into the Lydian Empire. Once Ephesus was under Lydian rule, Croesus provided patronage for the reconstruction of the Temple of Artemis, to which he offered a large number of marble columns as dedication to the goddess.

Meanwhile the Ionian city of Miletus had been willingly sending tribute to Mena in exchange for being spared from Lydian attacks because the overthrow of the city&#x27;s last tyrants, Thoas and Damasenor, and the replacement of the tyranny by a system of magistrates had annulated the relations of friendship initiated by Alyattes and the former Milesian tyrant Thrasybulus.

Croesus continued his attacks against the other Greek cities of the western coast of Asia Minor until he had subjugated all of mainland Ionia, Aeolis, and Doris, but he abandoned his plans of annexing the Greek city-states on the islands and he instead concluded treaties of friendship with them, which might have helped him participate in the lucrative trade the Aegean Greeks carried out with Egypt at Naucratis.

===Other domains of the Lydian Empire under Croesus===
The Lydians had already conquered Phrygia under the rule of Alyattes, who took advantage of the weakening of the various polities all across Anatolia by the Cimmerian raids and used the lack of a centralised Phrygian state and the traditionally friendly relations between the Lydian and Phrygian elites to extend Lydian rule eastwards to Phrygia. Lydian presence in Phrygia is archaeologically attested by the existence of a Lydian citadel in the Phrygian capital of Gordion, as well as Lydian architectural remains in northwest Phrygia, such as in Dascylium, and in the Phrygian Highlands at Midas City. Lydian troops might have been stationed in the aforementioned locations as well as in Hacıtuğrul, Afyonkarahisar, and Konya, which would have provided to the Lydian kingdom access to the produce and roads of Phrygia. The presence of a Lydian ivory plaque at Kerkenes Daǧ suggests that Alyattes&#x27;s control of Phrygia might have extended to the east of the Halys River to include the city of Pteria, with the possibility that he may have rebuilt this city and placed a Phrygian ruler there: Pteria&#x27;s strategic location would have been useful in protecting the Lydian Empire from attacks from the east, and its proximity to the Royal Road would have made of the city an important centre from which caravans could be protected. Phrygia under Lydian rule would continue to be administered by its local elites, such as the ruler of Midas City who held Phrygian royal titles such as (king) and (commander of the armies), but were under the authority of the Lydian kings of Sardis and had a Lydian diplomatic presence at their court, following the framework of the traditional vassalage treaties used since the period of the Hittite and Assyrian empires, and according to which the Lydian king imposed on the vassal rulers a &quot;treaty of vassalage&quot; which allowed the local Phrygian rulers to remain in power, in exchange of which the Phrygian vassals had the duty to provide military support and sometimes offer rich tribute to the Lydian kingdom.

This situation continued under the rule of Croesus, with one inscription attesting of the presence of Croesus&#x27;s son Atys at the court of one local ruler of Midas City himself named Midas. At Midas City, Atys held the position of priest of the sacred fire of the mother goddess Aryastin, and through him Croesus provided patronage to the building of the religious monument in the city now known as the Midas Monument.

The presence of Atys at the court of this Midas might have inspired the legend recounted by Herodotus, according to which Croesus had a dream in which Atys was killed by an iron spear, after which he prevented his son from leading military activities, but Atys nevertheless found death while hunting a wild boar which was ravaging Lydia, during which he was accidentally hit by the spear thrown by the Phrygian prince Adrastus, who had previously exiled himself to Lydia after accidentally killing his own brother.

Croesus also brought Caria, whose various city-states had since Gyges been allied to the Mermnad dynasty, and from where Croesus&#x27;s own mother originated, under the direct control of the Lydian Empire.

Thus, according to Herodotus, Croesus ruled over all the peoples to the west of the Halys River - the Lydians, Phrygians, Mysians, Mariandyni, Chalybes, Paphlagonians, Thyni and Bithyni Thracians, Carians, Ionians, Dorians, Aeolians, and Pamphylians. However information only about the relations between the Lydians and the Phrygians is attested in both literary and archaeological sources, and there is no available data concerning relations between the other mentioned peoples and the Lydian kings; moreover, given this was the situation detailed by Herodotus under the reign of Croesus, it is very likely that a number of these populations had already been conquered under Alyattes. The only populations Herodotus claimed were independent of the Lydian Empire were the Lycians, who lived in a mountainous country which would not have been accessible to the Lydian armies, and the Cilicians, who had already been conquered by Neo-Babylonian Empire. Modern estimates nevertheless suggest that it is not impossible that the Lydians might have subjected Lycia, given that the Lycian coast would have been important for the Lydians because it was close to a trade route connecting the Aegean region, the Levant, and Cyprus. Modern studies also consider doubtful the Graeco-Roman historians&#x27; traditional account of the Halys River as having been set as the border between the Lydian and the Median kingdom, which appears to have been a retroactive narrative construction based on symbolic role assigned by Greeks to the Halys as the separation between Lower Asia and Upper Asia as well as on the Halys being a later provincial border within the Achaemenid Empire. The eastern border of the kingdom of Croesus would thus have instead been further to the east of the Halys, at an undetermined point in eastern Anatolia.

===International relations===
Croesus continued the friendly relations with the Medes concluded by his father Alyattes and the Median king Cyaxares after five years of war in 585 BC, shortly before both their respective deaths that same year. As part of the peace treaty ending the war between Media and Lydia, Croesus&#x27;s sister Aryenis had married Cyaxares&#x27;s son and successor Astyages, who thus became Croesus&#x27;s brother-in-law, while a daughter of Cyaxares might have been married to Croesus. Croesus continued these good relations with the Medes after he succeeded Alyattes and Astyages succeeded Cyaxares.

Under Croesus&#x27;s rule, Lydia continued its good relations started by Gyges with the Saite Egyptian kingdom, then ruled by the pharaoh Amasis II. Both Croesus and Amasis had common interests in fostering trade relations at Naucratis with the Greeks, including with the Milesians who were under Lydian authority. These trade relations also functioned as an access point for Greek mercenaries serving the Saite pharaohs.

Croesus also established trade and diplomatic relations with the Neo-Babylonian Empire of Nabonidus, which ensured the transition of Lydian products towards Babylonian markets.

===Votive offerings to Delphi===
Croesus also continued the good relations between Lydia and the sanctuary of the god Apollo in Delphi on continental Greece first established by his great-great-grandfather Gyges and maintained by his father Alyattes, and just like his ancestors, Croesus offered the sanctuary rich presents in dedication, including a lion made of gold and weighing ten talents. In exchange for the offerings of Croesus to the sanctuary of Apollo, the Lydians obtained precedence in consulting its oracle, were exempt from taxes, were allowed to sit at the first rank, and were granted the permission to become Delphian priests. These exchanges of gifts for privileges in turn meant that strong relations of hospitality existed between Lydia and Delphi due to which the Delphians had the duty to welcome, protect, and ensure the well-being of Lydian ambassadors.

Croesus further increased his contacts with the Greeks on the European continent by establishing relations with the city-state of Sparta, to whom he provided the gold they needed to gild a statue of the god Apollo after the oracle of Delphi told them they would obtain this gold from Croesus.

===Coinage===
Croesus is credited with issuing the first true gold coins with a standardised purity for general circulation, the Croeseid (following on from his father Alyattes who invented minting with electrum coins). Indeed, the invention of coinage had passed into Greek society through Hermodike II. Hermodike II, the daughter of an Agamemnon of Cyme, claimed descent from the original Agamemnon who conquered Troy. She was likely one of Alyettes’ wives, so may have been Croesus’ mother, because the bull imagery on the croeseid symbolises the Hellenic Zeus—see Europa (consort of Zeus). Zeus, through Hercules, was the divine forefather of his family line.

Moreover, the first coins were quite crude and made of electrum, a naturally occurring pale yellow alloy of gold and silver. The composition of these first coins was similar to alluvial deposits found in the silt of the Pactolus river (made famous by Midas), which ran through the Lydian capital, Sardis. Later coins, including some in the British Museum, were made from gold purified by heating with common salt to remove the silver.

In Greek and Persian cultures the name of Croesus became a synonym for a wealthy man. He inherited great wealth from his father Alyattes, who had become associated with the Midas myth because Lydian precious metals came from the river Pactolus, in which King Midas supposedly washed away his ability to turn all he touched into gold. In reality, Alyattes&#x27; tax revenues may have been the real &#x27;Midas touch&#x27; financing his and Croesus&#x27; conquests. Croesus&#x27; wealth remained proverbial beyond classical antiquity: in English, expressions such as &quot;rich as Croesus&quot; or &quot;richer than Croesus&quot; are used to indicate great wealth to this day. The earliest known such usage in English was John Gower&#x27;s in &quot;Confessio amantis&quot; (1390):

Original text:
Modern spelling:

=== Interview with Solon ===

According to Herodotus, Croesus encountered the Greek sage Solon and showed him his enormous wealth. Croesus, secure in his own wealth and happiness, asked Solon who the happiest man in the world was, and was disappointed by Solon&#x27;s response that three had been happier than Croesus: Tellus, who died fighting for his country, and the brothers Kleobis and Biton who died peacefully in their sleep after their mother prayed for their perfect happiness because they had demonstrated filial piety by drawing her to a festival in an oxcart themselves. 
Solon goes on to explain that Croesus cannot be the happiest man because the fickleness of fortune means that the happiness of a man&#x27;s life cannot be judged until after his death. Sure enough, Croesus&#x27; hubristic happiness was reversed by the tragic deaths of his accidentally killed son and, according to Ctesias, his wife&#x27;s suicide at the fall of Sardis, not to mention his defeat at the hands of the Persians.

The interview is in the nature of a philosophical disquisition on the subject &quot;Which man is happy?&quot; It is legendary rather than historical. Thus, the &quot;happiness&quot; of Croesus is presented as a moralistic &quot;exemplum&quot; of the fickleness of Tyche, a theme that gathered strength from the fourth century, revealing its late date. The story was later retold and elaborated by Ausonius in &quot;The Masque of the Seven Sages&quot;, in the &quot;Suda&quot; (entry &quot;Μᾶλλον ὁ Φρύξ,&quot; which adds Aesop and the Seven Sages of Greece), and by Tolstoy in his short story &quot;Croesus and Fate&quot;.

===War against Persia and defeat===

In 550 BC, Croesus&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Median king Astyages, was overthrown by his own grandson, the Persian king Cyrus the Great. In a likely legendary event recounted by Herodotus, Croesus responded by consulting the oracle of Delphi, who told him that he would &quot;destroy a great empire&quot; should he attack Cyrus. This answer of the Delphian oracle remains one of the famous oracular statements from Delphi. Likely legendary were also the responses of the oracles of Delphi and Amphiaraus telling Croesus to ally with the strongest of all Greeks, whom Croesus found out to be the state to which he had previously offered the gold which they had used for the gilding of a statue of the god Apollo, Sparta, shortly after its victory over its fellow Greek city-state of Argos in 547 BC. The claim of Herodotus that Croesus, Amasis, and Nabonidus formed a defensive alliance against Cyrus of Persia appears to have been a retroactive exaggeration of the existing diplomatic and trade relations between Lydia, Egypt, and Babylon.

Croesus first attacked Pteria, the capital of a Phrygian state vassal to the Lydians which might have attempted to rebel against Lydian suzerainty and instead declare its allegiance to the new Persian Empire of Cyrus. Cyrus retaliated by intervening in Cappadocia and attacking the Lydians at Pteria in a battle in which Croesus was defeated. After this first battle, Croesus burnt down Pteria to prevent Cyrus from using its strategic location and returned to Sardis. However, Cyrus followed Croesus and defeated the Lydian army again at Thymbra before besieging and capturing the Lydian capital of Sardis, thus bringing an end to the rule of the Mermnad dynasty and to the Lydian Empire. Lydia would never regain its independence and would remain a part of various successive empires.

Although the dates for the battles of Pteria and Thymbra and of end of the Lydian empire have been traditionally fixed to 547 BC, more recent estimates suggest that Herodotus&#x27;s account being unreliable chronologically concerning the fall of Lydia means that there are currently no ways of dating the fall of Sardis; theoretically, it may even have taken place after the fall of Babylon in 539 BC.

===Later life and death===
Croesus&#x27;s fate after the Persian conquest of Lydia is uncertain: Herodotus, the poet Bacchylides and Nicolaus of Damascus claimed that Croesus either tried to commit suicide on a pyre or was condemned by the Persians to be burnt at the stake until a thunderstorm&#x27;s rain water extinguished the fire after either his or his son&#x27;s prayers to the god Apollo (or after Cyrus heard Croesus calling the name of Solon). In most versions of the story, Cyrus kept Croesus as his advisor, although Bacchylides claimed that the god Zeus carried Croesus away to Hyperborea. Xenophon similarly claimed that Cyrus kept Croesus as his advisor, while Ctesias claimed that Cyrus appointed Croesus as the governor of the city of Barene in Media.

A passage from the Nabonidus Chronicle was long held to have referred to a military campaign of Cyrus against a country whose name has been largely erased except for the first cuneiform character which had been interpreted as &quot;Lu&quot;, extrapolated to be the first syllable of an Akkadian name for Lydia. This passage in the Nabonidus Chronicle would thus have referred to a campaign by Cyrus against Lydia around 547 BC during which he &quot;marched against the country, killed its king, took his possessions, and put there a garrison of his own&quot;. However, the verb used in the Nabonidus Chronicle could be used both in the sense &quot;to kill&quot; and &quot;to destroy as a military power&quot;, making any precise deduction of the fate of Croesus from it impossible. More recent studies have moreover concluded that the non-erased cuneiform sign was not &quot;Lu&quot;, but rather Ú, making untenable the interpretation of the text as talking of a campaign against Lydia, and instead suggesting that the campaign was against Urartu.

The scholar Max Mallowan argued that there is no evidence that Cyrus the Great killed Croesus, in particular rejected the account of burning on a pyre, and interpreted Bacchylides&#x27; narration as Croesus attempting suicide and then being saved by Cyrus.

The historian Kevin Leloux instead maintained the reading of the Nabonidus Chronicle as referring to a campaign of Cyrus against Lydia to argue that Croesus was indeed executed by Cyrus. According to him, the story of Croesus and the pyre would have been imagined by the Greeks based on the fires started during the Persian capture of Sardis throughout the lower city, where the buildings were made largely of wood.

In 2003, Stephanie West argued that the historical Croesus did in fact die on the pyre, and that the stories of him as a wise advisor to the courts of Cyrus and Cambyses are purely legendary, showing similarities to the sayings of Ahiqar. A similar conclusion is drawn in a recent article that makes a case for the proposal that the Lydian word Qλdãnś, both meaning &#x27;king&#x27; and the name of a god, and pronounced /kʷɾʲ&#x27;ðãns/ with four consecutive Lydian sounds unfamiliar to ancient Greeks, could correspond to Greek , or . If the identification is correct it might have the interesting historical consequence that king Croesus chose suicide at the stake and was subsequently deified.

==Legacy==
After defeating Croesus, Cyrus adopted the use of gold coinage as the main currency of his kingdom. The use of croesid coins under the Persian Empire would continue under Cyrus, and would end only after Darius the Great replaced them by the Persian daric. These late croesid coins bearing &quot;bull and lion&quot; images used under Cyrus differed from previous Mermnad croesids in that they were lighter and their weight was closer to those of the early golden darics and silver sigloi.

===In popular culture===
According to the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi (c. 410–490s AD), who wrote a monumental &quot;History of Armenia&quot;, the Armenian king Artaxias I accomplished many military deeds, which include the capture of Croesus and the conquest of the Lydian kingdom (2.12–13). References to Croesus&#x27; legendary power and wealth, often as a symbol of human vanity, are numerous in literature.

The following, by Isaac Watts, is from the poem &quot;False Greatness&quot;:

Another literary example is &quot;Croesus and Fate&quot;, a short story by Leo Tolstoy that is a retelling of the account of Croesus as told by Herodotus and Plutarch.

&quot;Crœsus, King of Lydia&quot;, is a tragedy in five parts by Alfred Bate Richards, first published in 1845.

To be &quot;riche comme Crésus&quot; is a popular French saying to describe the wealthiest of the wealthy, and gave its name to a TF1 game show &quot;Crésus&quot;, where the king is reimagined as a CGI skeleton, who has returned from the dead to give some of his money away to lucky contestants.

On &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the wealthy Montgomery Burns lives at the corner of Croesus and Mammon Streets.

In &quot;The Sopranos&quot; season 4 episode 6, Ralph Cifaretto tells Artie Bucco “With what you take out of that bar, you must be sitting on money like King Croesus.”

In &quot;Squidbillies&quot; season 6 episode 8, Dan Halen remarks that he paid Early Cuyler, who he said &quot;left with cash in hand, rich as Croesus&quot;.

In &quot;Ghosts (2019 TV series)&quot; season 1 episode 5, Julian Fawcett (played by Simon Farnaby) compares Barclays Beg-Chetwynde (played by Geoffrey McGivern) to Croesus, &quot;Oh I remember this berk... rich as Croesus, loves the sound of his own voice.&quot;

In &quot;East of Eden&quot; Chapter 34, John Steinbeck refers to Croesus to explain living a righteous life. Wealth will vanish as did with Croesus. So, the question one should ask to determine whether one lived a good life or not is “Was he loved or was he hated? Is his death felt as a loss or does a kind of joy come of it?”

In 1968, English psychedelic pop band, World of Oz, released its single titled &quot;King Croesus.&quot;

<text>In medicine, a prosthesis (: prostheses; from ), or a prosthetic implant, is an artificial device that replaces a missing body part, which may be lost through physical trauma, disease, or a condition present at birth (congenital disorder). Prostheses may restore the normal functions of the missing body part, or may perform a cosmetic function.

A person who has undergone an amputation is sometimes referred to as an amputee, however, this term may be offensive. Rehabilitation for someone with an amputation is primarily coordinated by a physiatrist as part of an inter-disciplinary team consisting of physiatrists, prosthetists, nurses, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. Prostheses can be created by hand or with computer-aided design (CAD), a software interface that helps creators design and analyze the creation with computer-generated 2-D and 3-D graphics as well as analysis and optimization tools.

==Types==
A person&#x27;s prosthesis should be designed and assembled according to the person&#x27;s appearance and functional needs. For instance, a person may need a transradial prosthesis, but the person needs to choose between an aesthetic functional device, a myoelectric device, a body-powered device, or an activity specific device. The person&#x27;s future goals and economical capabilities may help them choose between one or more devices.

=== Craniofacial prostheses ===
include intra-oral and extra-oral prostheses. Extra-oral prostheses are further divided into hemifacial, auricular (ear), nasal, orbital and ocular. Intra-oral prostheses include dental prostheses, such as dentures, obturators, and dental implants.

Prostheses of the neck include larynx substitutes, trachea and upper esophageal replacements,

Somato prostheses of the torso include breast prostheses which may be either single or bilateral, full breast devices or nipple prostheses.

Penile prostheses are used to treat erectile dysfunction, correct penile deformity, perform phalloplasty procedures in cisgender men, and to build a new penis in female-to-male gender reassignment surgeries.

===Limb prostheses===
Limb prostheses include both upper- and lower-extremity prostheses.

Upper-extremity prostheses are used at varying levels of amputation: forequarter, shoulder disarticulation, transhumeral prosthesis, elbow disarticulation, transradial prosthesis, wrist disarticulation, full hand, partial hand, finger, partial finger. A transradial prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces an arm missing below the elbow.

Upper limb prostheses can be categorized in three main categories: Passive devices, Body Powered devices, and Externally Powered (myoelectric) devices. Passive devices can either be passive hands, mainly used for cosmetic purposes, or passive tools, mainly used for specific activities (e.g. leisure or vocational). An extensive overview and classification of passive devices can be found in a literature review by Maat &quot;et.al.&quot; A passive device can be static, meaning the device has no movable parts, or it can be adjustable, meaning its configuration can be adjusted (e.g. adjustable hand opening). Despite the absence of active grasping, passive devices are very useful in bimanual tasks that require fixation or support of an object, or for gesticulation in social interaction. According to scientific data a third of the upper limb amputees worldwide use a passive prosthetic hand. Body Powered or cable-operated limbs work by attaching a harness and cable around the opposite shoulder of the damaged arm. A recent body-powered approach has explored the utilization of the user&#x27;s breathing to power and control the prosthetic hand to help eliminate actuation cable and harness. The third category of available prosthetic devices comprises myoelectric arms. This particular class of devices distinguishes itself from the previous ones due to the inclusion of a battery system. This battery serves the dual purpose of providing energy for both actuation and sensing components. While actuation predominantly relies on motor or pneumatic systems, a variety of solutions have been explored for capturing muscle activity, including techniques such as Electromyography, Sonomyography, Myokinetic, and others. These methods function by detecting the minute electrical currents generated by contracted muscles during upper arm movement, typically employing electrodes or other suitable tools. Subsequently, these acquired signals are converted into gripping patterns or postures that the artificial hand will then execute.

In the prosthetics industry, a trans-radial prosthetic arm is often referred to as a &quot;BE&quot; or below elbow prosthesis.

Lower-extremity prostheses provide replacements at varying levels of amputation. These include hip disarticulation, transfemoral prosthesis, knee disarticulation, transtibial prosthesis, Syme&#x27;s amputation, foot, partial foot, and toe. The two main subcategories of lower extremity prosthetic devices are trans-tibial (any amputation transecting the tibia bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a tibial deficiency) and trans-femoral (any amputation transecting the femur bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a femoral deficiency).

A transfemoral prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces a leg missing above the knee. Transfemoral amputees can have a very difficult time regaining normal movement. In general, a transfemoral amputee must use approximately 80% more energy to walk than a person with two whole legs. This is due to the complexities in movement associated with the knee. In newer and more improved designs, hydraulics, carbon fiber, mechanical linkages, motors, computer microprocessors, and innovative combinations of these technologies are employed to give more control to the user. In the prosthetics industry, a trans-femoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an &quot;AK&quot; or above the knee prosthesis.

A transtibial prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces a leg missing below the knee. A transtibial amputee is usually able to regain normal movement more readily than someone with a transfemoral amputation, due in large part to retaining the knee, which allows for easier movement. Lower extremity prosthetics describe artificially replaced limbs located at the hip level or lower. In the prosthetics industry, a trans-tibial prosthetic leg is often referred to as a &quot;BK&quot; or below the knee prosthesis.

Prostheses are manufactured and fit by clinical prosthetists. Prosthetists are healthcare professionals responsible for making, fitting, and adjusting prostheses and for lower limb prostheses will assess both gait and prosthetic alignment. Once a prosthesis has been fit and adjusted by a prosthetist, a rehabilitation physiotherapist (called physical therapist in America) will help teach a new prosthetic user to walk with a leg prosthesis. To do so, the physical therapist may provide verbal instructions and may also help guide the person using touch or tactile cues. This may be done in a clinic or home. There is some research suggesting that such training in the home may be more successful if the treatment includes the use of a treadmill. Using a treadmill, along with the physical therapy treatment, helps the person to experience many of the challenges of walking with a prosthesis.

In the United Kingdom, 75% of lower limb amputations are performed due to inadequate circulation (dysvascularity). This condition is often associated with many other medical conditions (co-morbidities) including diabetes and heart disease that may make it a challenge to recover and use a prosthetic limb to regain mobility and independence. For people who have inadequate circulation and have lost a lower limb, there is insufficient evidence due to a lack of research, to inform them regarding their choice of prosthetic rehabilitation approaches.

Lower extremity prostheses are often categorized by the level of amputation or after the name of a surgeon:

* Transfemoral (Above-knee) 
* Transtibial (Below-knee)
* Ankle disarticulation (more commonly known as Syme&#x27;s amputation)
* Knee disarticulation &quot;(also see knee replacement)&quot;
* Hip disarticulation, &quot;(also see hip replacement)&quot;
* Hemi-pelvictomy
* Partial foot amputations (Pirogoff, Talo-Navicular and Calcaneo-cuboid (Chopart), Tarso-metatarsal (Lisfranc), Trans-metatarsal, Metatarsal-phalangeal, Ray amputations, toe amputations).
* Van Nes rotationplasty

====Prosthetic raw materials====
Prosthetic are made lightweight for better convenience for the amputee. Some of these materials include:
* Plastics:
** Polyethylene
** Polypropylene
** Acrylics
** Polyurethane
* Wood (early prosthetics)
* Rubber (early prosthetics)
* Lightweight metals:

** Aluminum
*Composites:
** Carbon fiber reinforced polymers

Wheeled prostheses have also been used extensively in the rehabilitation of injured domestic animals, including dogs, cats, pigs, rabbits, and turtles.

==History==

Prosthetics originate from the ancient Near East circa 3000 BCE, with the earliest evidence of prosthetics appearing in ancient Egypt and Iran. The earliest recorded mention of eye prosthetics is from the Egyptian story of the Eye of Horus dated circa 3000 BC, which involves the left eye of Horus being plucked out and then restored by Thoth. Circa 3000-2800 BC, the earliest archaeological evidence of prosthetics is found in ancient Iran, where an eye prosthetic is found buried with a woman in Shahr-i Shōkhta. It was likely made of bitumen paste that was covered with a thin layer of gold. The Egyptians were also early pioneers of foot prosthetics, as shown by the wooden toe found on a body from the New Kingdom circa 1000 BC. Another early textual mention is found in South Asia circa 1200 BC, involving the warrior queen Vishpala in the Rigveda. Roman bronze crowns have also been found, but their use could have been more aesthetic than medical.

An early mention of a prosthetic comes from the Greek historian Herodotus, who tells the story of Hegesistratus, a Greek diviner who cut off his own foot to escape his Spartan captors and replaced it with a wooden one.

=== Wood and metal prosthetics ===

Pliny the Elder also recorded the tale of a Roman general, Marcus Sergius, whose right hand was cut off while campaigning and had an iron hand made to hold his shield so that he could return to battle. A famous and quite refined historical prosthetic arm was that of Götz von Berlichingen, made at the beginning of the 16th century. The first confirmed use of a prosthetic device, however, is from 950 to 710 BC. In 2000, research pathologists discovered a mummy from this period buried in the Egyptian necropolis near ancient Thebes that possessed an artificial big toe. This toe, consisting of wood and leather, exhibited evidence of use. When reproduced by bio-mechanical engineers in 2011, researchers discovered that this ancient prosthetic enabled its wearer to walk both barefoot and in Egyptian style sandals. Previously, the earliest discovered prosthetic was an artificial leg from Capua.

Around the same time, François de la Noue is also reported to have had an iron hand, as is, in the 17th century, René-Robert Cavalier de la Salle. Henri de Tonti had a prosthetic hook for a hand. During the Middle Ages, prosthetics remained quite basic in form. Debilitated knights would be fitted with prosthetics so they could hold up a shield, grasp a lance or a sword, or stabilize a mounted warrior. Only the wealthy could afford anything that would assist in daily life.

One notable prosthesis was that belonging to an Italian man, who scientists estimate replaced his amputated right hand with a knife. Scientists investigating the skeleton, which was found in a Longobard cemetery in Povegliano Veronese, estimated that the man had lived sometime between the 6th and 8th centuries AD. Materials found near the man&#x27;s body suggest that the knife prosthesis was attached with a leather strap, which he repeatedly tightened with his teeth.

During the Renaissance, prosthetics developed with the use of iron, steel, copper, and wood. Functional prosthetics began to make an appearance in the 1500s.

=== Technology progress before the 20th century ===
An Italian surgeon recorded the existence of an amputee who had an arm that allowed him to remove his hat, open his purse, and sign his name. Improvement in amputation surgery and prosthetic design came at the hands of Ambroise Paré. Among his inventions was an above-knee device that was a kneeling peg leg and foot prosthesis with a fixed position, adjustable harness, and knee lock control. The functionality of his advancements showed how future prosthetics could develop.

Other major improvements before the modern era:
* Pieter Verduyn – First non-locking below-knee (BK) prosthesis.
* James Potts – Prosthesis made of a wooden shank and socket, a steel knee joint and an articulated foot that was controlled by catgut tendons from the knee to the ankle. Came to be known as &quot;Anglesey Leg&quot; or &quot;Selpho Leg&quot;.
* Sir James Syme – A new method of ankle amputation that did not involve amputating at the thigh.
* Benjamin Palmer – Improved upon the Selpho leg. Added an anterior spring and concealed tendons to simulate natural-looking movement.
* Dubois Parmlee – Created prosthetic with a suction socket, polycentric knee, and multi-articulated foot.
* Marcel Desoutter &amp; Charles Desoutter – First aluminium prosthesis
* Henry Heather Bigg, and his son Henry Robert Heather Bigg, won the Queen&#x27;s command to provide &quot;surgical appliances&quot; to wounded soldiers after Crimea War. They developed arms that allowed a double arm amputee to crochet, and a hand that felt natural to others based on ivory, felt and leather.

At the end of World War II, the NAS (National Academy of Sciences) began to advocate better research and development of prosthetics. Through government funding, a research and development program was developed within the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Veterans Administration.

===Lower extremity modern history===

After the Second World War, a team at the University of California, Berkeley including James Foort and C.W. Radcliff helped to develop the quadrilateral socket by developing a jig fitting system for amputations above the knee. Socket technology for lower extremity limbs saw a further revolution during the 1980s when John Sabolich C.P.O., invented the Contoured Adducted Trochanteric-Controlled Alignment Method (CATCAM) socket, later to evolve into the Sabolich Socket. He followed the direction of Ivan Long and Ossur Christensen as they developed alternatives to the quadrilateral socket, which in turn followed the open ended plug socket, created from wood. The advancement was due to the difference in the socket to patient contact model. Prior to this, sockets were made in the shape of a square shape with no specialized containment for muscular tissue. New designs thus help to lock in the bony anatomy, locking it into place and distributing the weight evenly over the existing limb as well as the musculature of the patient. Ischial containment is well known and used today by many prosthetist to help in patient care. Variations of the ischial containment socket thus exists and each socket is tailored to the specific needs of the patient. Others who contributed to socket development and changes over the years include Tim Staats, Chris Hoyt, and Frank Gottschalk. Gottschalk disputed the efficacy of the CAT-CAM socket- insisting the surgical procedure done by the amputation surgeon was most important to prepare the amputee for good use of a prosthesis of any type socket design.

The first microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees became available in the early 1990s. The Intelligent Prosthesis was the first commercially available microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee. It was released by Chas. A. Blatchford &amp; Sons, Ltd., of Great Britain, in 1993 and made walking with the prosthesis feel and look more natural. An improved version was released in 1995 by the name Intelligent Prosthesis Plus. Blatchford released another prosthesis, the Adaptive Prosthesis, in 1998. The Adaptive Prosthesis utilized hydraulic controls, pneumatic controls, and a microprocessor to provide the amputee with a gait that was more responsive to changes in walking speed. Cost analysis reveals that a sophisticated above-knee prosthesis will be about $1 million in 45 years, given only annual cost of living adjustments.

In 2019, a project under AT2030 was launched in which bespoke sockets are made using a thermoplastic, rather than through a plaster cast. This is faster to do and significantly less expensive. The sockets were called Amparo Confidence sockets.

===Upper extremity modern history===

In 2005, DARPA started the Revolutionizing Prosthetics program. According to DARPA, the goal of the $100 million program was to &quot;develop an advanced electromechanical prosthetic upper limb with near-natural control that would dramatically enhance independence and quality of life for amputees.&quot; In 2014, the LUKE Arm developed by Dean Kamen and his team at DEKA Research and Development Corp. became the first prosthetic arm approved by FDA that &quot;translates signals from a person&#x27;s muscles to perform complex tasks,&quot; according to FDA. Johns Hopkins University and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs also participated in the program.

=== Design trends moving forward ===
There are many steps in the evolution of prosthetic design trends that are moving forward with time. Many design trends point to lighter, more durable, and flexible materials like carbon fiber, silicone, and advanced polymers. These not only make the prosthetic limb lighter and more durable but also allow it to mimic the look and feel of natural skin, providing users with a more comfortable and natural experience. This new technology helps prosthetic users blend in with people with normal ligaments to reduce the stigmatism for people who wear prosthetics. Another trend points towards using bionics and myoelectric components in prosthetic design. These limbs utilize sensors to detect electrical signals from the user&#x27;s residual muscles. The signals are then converted into motions, allowing users to control their prosthetic limbs using their own muscle contractions. This has greatly improved the range and fluidity of movements available to amputees, making tasks like grasping objects or walking naturally much more feasible. Integration with AI is also on the forefront to the prosthetic design. AI-enabled prosthetic limbs can learn and adapt to the user&#x27;s habits and preferences over time, ensuring optimal functionality. By analyzing the user&#x27;s gait, grip, and other movements, these smart limbs can make real-time adjustments, providing smoother and more natural motions.

==Patient procedure==
A prosthesis is a functional replacement for an amputated or congenitally malformed or missing limb. Prosthetists are responsible for the prescription, design, and management of a prosthetic device.

In most cases, the prosthetist begins by taking a plaster cast of the patient&#x27;s affected limb. Lightweight, high-strength thermoplastics are custom-formed to this model of the patient. Cutting-edge materials such as carbon fiber, titanium and Kevlar provide strength and durability while making the new prosthesis lighter. More sophisticated prostheses are equipped with advanced electronics, providing additional stability and control.

==Current technology and manufacturing==

Over the years, there have been advancements in artificial limbs. New plastics and other materials, such as carbon fiber, have allowed artificial limbs to be stronger and lighter, limiting the amount of extra energy necessary to operate the limb. This is especially important for trans-femoral amputees. Additional materials have allowed artificial limbs to look much more realistic, which is important to trans-radial and transhumeral amputees because they are more likely to have the artificial limb exposed.
In addition to new materials, the use of electronics has become very common in artificial limbs. Myoelectric limbs, which control the limbs by converting muscle movements to electrical signals, have become much more common than cable operated limbs. Myoelectric signals are picked up by electrodes, the signal gets integrated and once it exceeds a certain threshold, the prosthetic limb control signal is triggered which is why inherently, all myoelectric controls lag. Conversely, cable control is immediate and physical, and through that offers a certain degree of direct force feedback that myoelectric control does not. Computers are also used extensively in the manufacturing of limbs. Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing are often used to assist in the design and manufacture of artificial limbs.

Most modern artificial limbs are attached to the residual limb (stump) of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by suction. The residual limb either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic, or—more commonly today—a liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by vacuum (suction sockets) or a pin lock. Liners are soft and by that, they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets. Silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes, mostly with a circular (round) cross section, but for any other residual limb shape, custom liners can be made. The socket is custom made to fit the residual limb and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the residual limb (rather than just one small spot), which helps reduce wear on the residual limb.

=== Production of prosthetic socket ===
The production of a prosthetic socket begins with capturing the geometry of the residual limb, this process is called shape capture. The goal of this process is to create an accurate representation of the residual limb, which is critical to achieve good socket fit. The custom socket is created by taking a plaster cast of the residual limb or, more commonly today, of the liner worn over their residual limb, and then making a mold from the plaster cast. The commonly used compound is called Plaster of Paris. In recent years, various digital shape capture systems have been developed which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design. In general, the shape capturing process begins with the digital acquisition of three-dimensional (3D) geometric data from the amputee&#x27;s residual limb. Data are acquired with either a probe, laser scanner, structured light scanner, or a photographic-based 3D scanning system.

After shape capture, the second phase of the socket production is called rectification, which is the process of modifying the model of the residual limb by adding volume to bony prominence and potential pressure points and remove volume from load bearing area. This can be done manually by adding or removing plaster to the positive model, or virtually by manipulating the computerized model in the software. Lastly, the fabrication of the prosthetic socket begins once the model has been rectified and finalized. The prosthetists would wrap the positive model with a semi-molten plastic sheet or carbon fiber coated with epoxy resin to construct the prosthetic socket. For the computerized model, it can be 3D printed using a various of material with different flexibility and mechanical strength.

Optimal socket fit between the residual limb and socket is critical to the function and usage of the entire prosthesis. If the fit between the residual limb and socket attachment is too loose, this will reduce the area of contact between the residual limb and socket or liner, and increase pockets between residual limb skin and socket or liner. Pressure then is higher, which can be painful. Air pockets can allow sweat to accumulate that can soften the skin. Ultimately, this is a frequent cause for itchy skin rashes. Over time, this can lead to breakdown of the skin. On the other hand, a very tight fit may excessively increase the interface pressures that may also lead to skin breakdown after prolonged use.

Artificial limbs are typically manufactured using the following steps:
# Measurement of the residual limb
# Measurement of the body to determine the size required for the artificial limb
# Fitting of a silicone liner
# Creation of a model of the liner worn over the residual limb
# Formation of thermoplastic sheet around the model – This is then used to test the fit of the prosthetic
# Formation of permanent socket
# Formation of plastic parts of the artificial limb – Different methods are used, including vacuum forming and injection molding
# Creation of metal parts of the artificial limb using die casting
# Assembly of entire limb

===Body-powered arms===

Current technology allows body-powered arms to weigh around one-half to one-third of what a myoelectric arm does.

====Sockets====
Current body-powered arms contain sockets that are built from hard epoxy or carbon fiber. These sockets or &quot;interfaces&quot; can be made more comfortable by lining them with a softer, compressible foam material that provides padding for the bone prominences. A self-suspending or supra-condylar socket design is useful for those with short to mid-range below elbow absence. Longer limbs may require the use of a locking roll-on type inner liner or more complex harnessing to help augment suspension.

====Wrists====
Wrist units are either screw-on connectors featuring the UNF 1/2-20 thread (USA) or quick-release connector, of which there are different models.

====Voluntary opening and voluntary closing====
Two types of body-powered systems exist, voluntary opening &quot;pull to open&quot; and voluntary closing &quot;pull to close&quot;. Virtually all &quot;split hook&quot; prostheses operate with a voluntary opening type system.

More modern &quot;prehensors&quot; called GRIPS utilize voluntary closing systems. The differences are significant. Users of voluntary opening systems rely on elastic bands or springs for gripping force, while users of voluntary closing systems rely on their own body power and energy to create gripping force.

Voluntary closing users can generate prehension forces equivalent to the normal hand, up to or exceeding one hundred pounds. Voluntary closing GRIPS require constant tension to grip, like a human hand, and in that property, they do come closer to matching human hand performance. Voluntary opening split hook users are limited to forces their rubber or springs can generate which usually is below 20 pounds.

====Feedback====
An additional difference exists in the biofeedback created that allows the user to &quot;feel&quot; what is being held. Voluntary opening systems once engaged provide the holding force so that they operate like a passive vice at the end of the arm. No gripping feedback is provided once the hook has closed around the object being held. Voluntary closing systems provide directly proportional control and biofeedback so that the user can feel how much force that they are applying.

In 1997, the Colombian Prof. Álvaro Ríos Poveda, a researcher in bionics in Latin America, developed an upper limb and hand prosthesis with sensory feedback. This technology allows amputee patients to handle prosthetic hand systems in a more natural way.

A recent study showed that by stimulating the median and ulnar nerves, according to the information provided by the artificial sensors from a hand prosthesis, physiologically appropriate (near-natural) sensory information could be provided to an amputee. This feedback enabled the participant to effectively modulate the grasping force of the prosthesis with no visual or auditory feedback.

In February 2013, researchers from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland and the Scuola Superiore Sant&#x27;Anna in Italy, implanted electrodes into an amputee&#x27;s arm, which gave the patient sensory feedback and allowed for real time control of the prosthetic. With wires linked to nerves in his upper arm, the Danish patient was able to handle objects and instantly receive a sense of touch through the special artificial hand that was created by Silvestro Micera and researchers both in Switzerland and Italy.

In July 2019, this technology was expanded on even further by researchers from the University of Utah, led by Jacob George. The group of researchers implanted electrodes into the patient&#x27;s arm to map out several sensory precepts. They would then stimulate each electrode to figure out how each sensory precept was triggered, then proceed to map the sensory information onto the prosthetic. This would allow the researchers to get a good approximation of the same kind of information that the patient would receive from their natural hand. Unfortunately, the arm is too expensive for the average user to acquire, however, Jacob mentioned that insurance companies could cover the costs of the prosthetic.

====Terminal devices====
Terminal devices contain a range of hooks, prehensors, hands or other devices.

=====Hooks=====
Voluntary opening split hook systems are simple, convenient, light, robust, versatile and relatively affordable.

A hook does not match a normal human hand for appearance or overall versatility, but its material tolerances can exceed and surpass the normal human hand for mechanical stress (one can even use a hook to slice open boxes or as a hammer whereas the same is not possible with a normal hand), for thermal stability (one can use a hook to grip items from boiling water, to turn meat on a grill, to hold a match until it has burned down completely) and for chemical hazards (as a metal hook withstands acids or lye, and does not react to solvents like a prosthetic glove or human skin).

=====Hands=====
Prosthetic hands are available in both voluntary opening and voluntary closing versions and because of their more complex mechanics and cosmetic glove covering require a relatively large activation force, which, depending on the type of harness used, may be uncomfortable. A recent study by the Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, showed that the development of mechanical prosthetic hands has been neglected during the past decades. The study showed that the pinch force level of most current mechanical hands is too low for practical use. The best tested hand was a prosthetic hand developed around 1945. In 2017 however, a research has been started with bionic hands by Laura Hruby of the Medical University of Vienna. A few open-hardware 3-D printable bionic hands have also become available. Some companies are also producing robotic hands with integrated forearm, for fitting unto a patient&#x27;s upper arm and in 2020, at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), another robotic hand with integrated forearm (Soft Hand Pro) was developed.

====Commercial providers and materials====
Hosmer and Otto Bock are major commercial hook providers. Mechanical hands are sold by Hosmer and Otto Bock as well; the Becker Hand is still manufactured by the Becker family. Prosthetic hands may be fitted with standard stock or custom-made cosmetic looking silicone gloves. But regular work gloves may be worn as well. Other terminal devices include the V2P Prehensor, a versatile robust gripper that allows customers to modify aspects of it, Texas Assist Devices (with a whole assortment of tools) and TRS that offers a range of terminal devices for sports. Cable harnesses can be built using aircraft steel cables, ball hinges, and self-lubricating cable sheaths. Some prosthetics have been designed specifically for use in salt water.

===Lower-extremity prosthetics===

Lower-extremity prosthetics describes artificially replaced limbs located at the hip level or lower. Concerning all ages Ephraim et al. (2003) found a worldwide estimate of all-cause lower-extremity amputations of 2.0–5.9 per 10,000 inhabitants. For birth prevalence rates of congenital limb deficiency they found an estimate between 3.5 and 7.1 cases per 10,000 births.

The two main subcategories of lower extremity prosthetic devices are trans-tibial (any amputation transecting the tibia bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a tibial deficiency), and trans-femoral (any amputation transecting the femur bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a femoral deficiency). In the prosthetic industry, a trans-tibial prosthetic leg is often referred to as a &quot;BK&quot; or below the knee prosthesis while the trans-femoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an &quot;AK&quot; or above the knee prosthesis.

Other, less prevalent lower extremity cases include the following:
# Hip disarticulations – This usually refers to when an amputee or congenitally challenged patient has either an amputation or anomaly at or in close proximity to the hip joint. &quot;See hip replacement&quot;
# Knee disarticulations – This usually refers to an amputation through the knee disarticulating the femur from the tibia. &quot;See knee replacement&quot;
# Symes – This is an ankle disarticulation while preserving the heel pad.

====Socket====
The socket serves as an interface between the residuum and the prosthesis, ideally allowing comfortable weight-bearing, movement control and proprioception. Socket problems, such as discomfort and skin breakdown, are rated among the most important issues faced by lower-limb amputees.

====Shank and connectors====
This part creates distance and support between the knee-joint and the foot (in case of an upper-leg prosthesis) or between the socket and the foot. The type of connectors that are used between the shank and the knee/foot determines whether the prosthesis is modular or not. Modular means that the angle and the displacement of the foot in respect to the socket can be changed after fitting. In developing countries prosthesis mostly are non-modular, in order to reduce cost. When considering children modularity of angle and height is important because of their average growth of 1.9 cm annually.

====Foot====
Providing contact to the ground, the foot provides shock absorption and stability during stance. Additionally it influences gait biomechanics by its shape and stiffness. This is because the trajectory of the center of pressure (COP) and the angle of the ground reaction forces is determined by the shape and stiffness of the foot and needs to match the subject&#x27;s build in order to produce a normal gait pattern. Andrysek (2010) found 16 different types of feet, with greatly varying results concerning durability and biomechanics. The main problem found in current feet is durability, endurance ranging from 16 to 32 months These results are for adults and will probably be worse for children due to higher activity levels and scale effects. Evidence comparing different types of feet and ankle prosthetic devices is not strong enough to determine if one mechanism of ankle/foot is superior to another. When deciding on a device, the cost of the device, a person&#x27;s functional need, and the availability of a particular device should be considered.

====Knee joint====

In case of a trans-femoral (above knee) amputation, there also is a need for a complex connector providing articulation, allowing flexion during swing-phase but not during stance. As its purpose is to replace the knee, the prosthetic knee joint is the most critical component of the prosthesis for trans-femoral amputees. The function of the good prosthetic knee joint is to mimic the function of the normal knee, such as providing structural support and stability during stance phase but able to flex in a controllable manner during swing phase. Hence it allows users to have a smooth and energy efficient gait and minimize the impact of amputation. The prosthetic knee is connected to the prosthetic foot by the shank, which is usually made of an aluminum or graphite tube.

One of the most important aspect of a prosthetic knee joint would be its stance-phase control mechanism. The function of stance-phase control is to prevent the leg from buckling when the limb is loaded during weight acceptance. This ensures the stability of the knee in order to support the single limb support task of stance phase and provides a smooth transition to the swing phase. Stance phase control can be achieved in several ways including the mechanical locks, relative alignment of prosthetic components, weight activated friction control, and polycentric mechanisms.

=====Microprocessor control=====
To mimic the knee&#x27;s functionality during gait, microprocessor-controlled knee joints have been developed that control the flexion of the knee. Some examples are Otto Bock&#x27;s C-leg, introduced in 1997, Ossur&#x27;s Rheo Knee, released in 2005, the Power Knee by Ossur, introduced in 2006, the Plié Knee from Freedom Innovations and DAW Industries&#x27; Self Learning Knee (SLK).

The idea was originally developed by Kelly James, a Canadian engineer, at the University of Alberta.

A microprocessor is used to interpret and analyze signals from knee-angle sensors and moment sensors. The microprocessor receives signals from its sensors to determine the type of motion being employed by the amputee. Most microprocessor controlled knee-joints are powered by a battery housed inside the prosthesis.

The sensory signals computed by the microprocessor are used to control the resistance generated by hydraulic cylinders in the knee-joint. Small valves control the amount of hydraulic fluid that can pass into and out of the cylinder, thus regulating the extension and compression of a piston connected to the upper section of the knee.

The main advantage of a microprocessor-controlled prosthesis is a closer approximation to an amputee&#x27;s natural gait. Some allow amputees to walk near walking speed or run. Variations in speed are also possible and are taken into account by sensors and communicated to the microprocessor, which adjusts to these changes accordingly. It also enables the amputees to walk downstairs with a step-over-step approach, rather than the one step at a time approach used with mechanical knees. There is some research suggesting that people with microprocessor-controlled prostheses report greater satisfaction and improvement in functionality, residual limb health, and safety. People may be able to perform everyday activities at greater speeds, even while multitasking, and reduce their risk of falls.

However, some have some significant drawbacks that impair its use. They can be susceptible to water damage and thus great care must be taken to ensure that the prosthesis remains dry.

===Myoelectric===
A myoelectric prosthesis uses the electrical tension generated every time a muscle contracts, as information. This tension can be captured from voluntarily contracted muscles by electrodes applied on the skin to control the movements of the prosthesis, such as elbow flexion/extension, wrist supination/pronation (rotation) or opening/closing of the fingers. A prosthesis of this type utilizes the residual neuromuscular system of the human body to control the functions of an electric powered prosthetic hand, wrist, elbow or foot. This is different from an electric switch prosthesis, which requires straps and/or cables actuated by body movements to actuate or operate switches that control the movements of the prosthesis. There is no clear evidence concluding that myoelectric upper extremity prostheses function better than body-powered prostheses. Advantages to using a myoelectric upper extremity prosthesis include the potential for improvement in cosmetic appeal (this type of prosthesis may have a more natural look), may be better for light everyday activities, and may be beneficial for people experiencing phantom limb pain. When compared to a body-powered prosthesis, a myoelectric prosthesis may not be as durable, may have a longer training time, may require more adjustments, may need more maintenance, and does not provide feedback to the user.

Prof. Alvaro Ríos Poveda has been working for several years on a non-invasive and affordable solution to this feedback problem. He considers that: &quot;Prosthetic limbs that can be controlled with thought hold great promise for the amputee, but without sensorial feedback from the signals returning to the brain, it can be difficult to achieve the level of control necessary to perform precise movements. When connecting the sense of touch from a mechanical hand directly to the brain, prosthetics can restore the function of the amputated limb in an almost natural-feeling way.&quot; He presented the first Myoelectric prosthetic hand with sensory feedback at the &quot;XVIII World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering&quot;, 1997, held in Nice, France.

The USSR was the first to develop a myoelectric arm in 1958, while the first myoelectric arm became commercial in 1964 by the Central Prosthetic Research Institute of the USSR, and distributed by the Hangar Limb Factory of the UK. The Myoelectric prosthesis are expensive requires regular maintenance, sensitive to sweat and moisture affecting sensor performance.

===Robotic prostheses===


Robots can be used to generate objective measures of patient&#x27;s impairment and therapy outcome, assist in diagnosis, customize therapies based on patient&#x27;s motor abilities, and assure compliance with treatment regimens and maintain patient&#x27;s records. It is shown in many studies that there is a significant improvement in upper limb motor function after stroke using robotics for upper limb rehabilitation.
In order for a robotic prosthetic limb to work, it must have several components to integrate it into the body&#x27;s function: Biosensors detect signals from the user&#x27;s nervous or muscular systems. It then relays this information to a microcontroller located inside the device, and processes feedback from the limb and actuator, e.g., position or force, and sends it to the controller. Examples include surface electrodes that detect electrical activity on the skin, needle electrodes implanted in muscle, or solid-state electrode arrays with nerves growing through them. One type of these biosensors are employed in myoelectric prostheses.

A device known as the controller is connected to the user&#x27;s nerve and muscular systems and the device itself. It sends intention commands from the user to the actuators of the device and interprets feedback from the mechanical and biosensors to the user. The controller is also responsible for the monitoring and control of the movements of the device.

An actuator mimics the actions of a muscle in producing force and movement. Examples include a motor that aids or replaces original muscle tissue.

Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) is a technique in which motor nerves, which previously controlled muscles on an amputated limb, are surgically rerouted such that they reinnervate a small region of a large, intact muscle, such as the pectoralis major. As a result, when a patient thinks about moving the thumb of their missing hand, a small area of muscle on their chest will contract instead. By placing sensors over the reinnervated muscle, these contractions can be made to control the movement of an appropriate part of the robotic prosthesis.

A variant of this technique is called targeted sensory reinnervation (TSR). This procedure is similar to TMR, except that sensory nerves are surgically rerouted to skin on the chest, rather than motor nerves rerouted to muscle. Recently, robotic limbs have improved in their ability to take signals from the human brain and translate those signals into motion in the artificial limb. DARPA, the Pentagon&#x27;s research division, is working to make even more advancements in this area. Their desire is to create an artificial limb that ties directly into the nervous system.

====Robotic arms====
Advancements in the processors used in myoelectric arms have allowed developers to make gains in fine-tuned control of the prosthetic. The Boston Digital Arm is a recent artificial limb that has taken advantage of these more advanced processors. The arm allows movement in five axes and allows the arm to be programmed for a more customized feel. Recently the I-LIMB Hand, invented in Edinburgh, Scotland, by David Gow has become the first commercially available hand prosthesis with five individually powered digits. The hand also possesses a manually rotatable thumb which is operated passively by the user and allows the hand to grip in precision, power, and key grip modes.

Another neural prosthetic is Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Proto 1. Besides the Proto 1, the university also finished the Proto 2 in 2010. Early in 2013, Max Ortiz Catalan and Rickard Brånemark of the Chalmers University of Technology, and Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden, succeeded in making the first robotic arm which is mind-controlled and can be permanently attached to the body (using osseointegration).

An approach that is very useful is called arm rotation which is common for unilateral amputees which is an amputation that affects only one side of the body; and also essential for bilateral amputees, a person who is missing or has had amputated either both arms or legs, to carry out activities of daily living. This involves inserting a small permanent magnet into the distal end of the residual bone of subjects with upper limb amputations. When a subject rotates the residual arm, the magnet will rotate with the residual bone, causing a change in magnetic field distribution. EEG (electroencephalogram) signals, detected using small flat metal discs attached to the scalp, essentially decoding human brain activity used for physical movement, is used to control the robotic limbs. This allows the user to control the part directly.

====Robotic transtibial prostheses ====
The research of robotic legs has made some advancement over time, allowing exact movement and control.

Researchers at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago announced in September 2013 that they have developed a robotic leg that translates neural impulses from the user&#x27;s thigh muscles into movement, which is the first prosthetic leg to do so. It is currently in testing.

Hugh Herr, head of the biomechatronics group at MIT&#x27;s Media Lab developed a robotic transtibial leg (PowerFoot BiOM).

The Icelandic company Össur has also created a robotic transtibial leg with motorized ankle that moves through algorithms and sensors that automatically adjust the angle of the foot during different points in its wearer&#x27;s stride. Also there are brain-controlled bionic legs that allow an individual to move his limbs with a wireless transmitter.

====Prosthesis design====
The main goal of a robotic prosthesis is to provide active actuation during gait to improve the biomechanics of gait, including, among other things, stability, symmetry, or energy expenditure for amputees. There are several powered prosthetic legs currently on the market, including fully powered legs, in which actuators directly drive the joints, and semi-active legs, which use small amounts of energy and a small actuator to change the mechanical properties of the leg but do not inject net positive energy into gait. Specific examples include The emPOWER from BionX, the Proprio Foot from Ossur, and the Elan Foot from Endolite. Various research groups have also experimented with robotic legs over the last decade. Central issues being researched include designing the behavior of the device during stance and swing phases, recognizing the current ambulation task, and various mechanical design problems such as robustness, weight, battery-life/efficiency, and noise-level. However, scientists from Stanford University and Seoul National University has developed artificial nerves system that will help prosthetic limbs feel. This synthetic nerve system enables prosthetic limbs sense braille, feel the sense of touch and respond to the environment.

===Use of recycled materials===
Prosthetics are being made from recycled plastic bottles and lids around the world.

== Direct bone attachment and osseointegration ==
Most prostheses are attached to the exterior of the body in a non-permanent way. The stump and socket method can cause significant pain for the person, which is why direct bone attachment has been explored extensively. 

Osseointegration is a method of attaching the artificial limb to the body by a prosthetic implant. 
This method is also sometimes referred to as &quot;exoprosthesis&quot; (attaching an artificial limb to the bone), or &quot;endo-exoprosthesis&quot;.
&quot;Endoprosthesis&quot; are prosthetic joint implants which remain wholly inside the body such as knee and hip replacement implants.

The method works by inserting a titanium bolt into the bone at the end of the stump. After several months the bone attaches itself to the titanium bolt and an abutment is attached to the titanium bolt. The abutment extends out of the stump and the (removable) artificial limb is then attached to the abutment. Some of the benefits of this method include the following:
* Better muscle control of the prosthetic.
* The ability to wear the prosthetic for an extended period of time; with the stump and socket method this is not possible.
* The ability for transfemoral amputees to drive a car.
The main disadvantage of this method is that amputees with the direct bone attachment cannot have large impacts on the limb, such as those experienced during jogging, because of the potential for the bone to break.

==Cosmesis==
Cosmetic prosthesis has long been used to disguise injuries and disfigurements. With advances in modern technology, cosmesis, the creation of lifelike limbs made from silicone or PVC, has been made possible. Such prosthetics, including artificial hands, can now be designed to simulate the appearance of real hands, complete with freckles, veins, hair, fingerprints and even tattoos.
Custom-made cosmeses are generally more expensive (costing thousands of U.S. dollars, depending on the level of detail), while standard cosmeses come premade in a variety of sizes, although they are often not as realistic as their custom-made counterparts. Another option is the custom-made silicone cover, which can be made to match a person&#x27;s skin tone but not details such as freckles or wrinkles. Cosmeses are attached to the body in any number of ways, using an adhesive, suction, form-fitting, stretchable skin, or a skin sleeve.

==Cognition==
Unlike neuromotor prostheses, neurocognitive prostheses would sense or modulate neural function in order to physically reconstitute or augment cognitive processes such as executive function, attention, language, and memory. No neurocognitive prostheses are currently available but the development of implantable neurocognitive brain-computer interfaces has been proposed to help treat conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, autism, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.
The recent field of Assistive Technology for Cognition concerns the development of technologies to augment human cognition. Scheduling devices such as Neuropage remind users with memory impairments when to perform certain activities, such as visiting the doctor. Micro-prompting devices such as PEAT, AbleLink and Guide have been used to aid users with memory and executive function problems perform activities of daily living.

==Prosthetic enhancement==
In addition to the standard artificial limb for everyday use, many amputees or congenital patients have special limbs and devices to aid in the participation of sports and recreational activities.

Within science fiction, and, more recently, within the scientific community, there has been consideration given to using advanced prostheses to replace healthy body parts with artificial mechanisms and systems to improve function. The morality and desirability of such technologies are being debated by transhumanists, other ethicists, and others in general. Body parts such as legs, arms, hands, feet, and others can be replaced.

The first experiment with a healthy individual appears to have been that by the British scientist Kevin Warwick. In 2002, an implant was interfaced directly into Warwick&#x27;s nervous system. The electrode array, which contained around a hundred electrodes, was placed in the median nerve. The signals produced were detailed enough that a robot arm was able to mimic the actions of Warwick&#x27;s own arm and provide a form of touch feedback again via the implant.

The DEKA company of Dean Kamen developed the &quot;Luke arm&quot;, an advanced nerve-controlled prosthetic. Clinical trials began in 2008, with FDA approval in 2014 and commercial manufacturing by the Universal Instruments Corporation expected in 2017. The price offered at retail by Mobius Bionics is expected to be around $100,000.

Further research in April 2019, there have been improvements towards prosthetic function and comfort of 3D-printed personalized wearable systems. Instead of manual integration after printing, integrating electronic sensors at the intersection between a prosthetic and the wearer&#x27;s tissue can gather information such as pressure across wearer&#x27;s tissue, that can help improve further iteration of these types of prosthetic.

===Oscar Pistorius===
In early 2008, Oscar Pistorius, the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; of South Africa, was briefly ruled ineligible to compete in the 2008 Summer Olympics because his transtibial prosthesis limbs were said to give him an unfair advantage over runners who had ankles. One researcher found that his limbs used twenty-five percent less energy than those of a non-disabled runner moving at the same speed. This ruling was overturned on appeal, with the appellate court stating that the overall set of advantages and disadvantages of Pistorius&#x27; limbs had not been considered.

Pistorius did not qualify for the South African team for the Olympics, but went on to sweep the 2008 Summer Paralympics, and has been ruled eligible to qualify for any future Olympics. He qualified for the 2011 World Championship in South Korea and reached the semi-final where he ended last timewise, he was 14th in the first round, his personal best at 400m would have given him 5th place in the finals. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Pistorius became the first amputee runner to compete at an Olympic Games. He ran in the 400 metres race semi-finals, and the 4 × 400 metres relay race finals. He also competed in 5 events in the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.

==Design considerations==
There are multiple factors to consider when designing a transtibial prosthesis. Manufacturers must make choices about their priorities regarding these factors.

===Performance===
Nonetheless, there are certain elements of socket and foot mechanics that are invaluable for the athlete, and these are the focus of today&#x27;s high-tech prosthetics companies:
* Fit – athletic/active amputees, or those with bony residua, may require a carefully detailed socket fit; less-active patients may be comfortable with a &#x27;total contact&#x27; fit and gel liner
* Energy storage and return – storage of energy acquired through ground contact and utilization of that stored energy for propulsion
* Energy absorption – minimizing the effect of high impact on the musculoskeletal system
* Ground compliance – stability independent of terrain type and angle
* Rotation – ease of changing direction
* Weight – maximizing comfort, balance and speed
* Suspension – how the socket will join and fit to the limb

===Other===
The buyer is also concerned with numerous other factors:
* Cosmetics
* Cost
* Ease of use
* Size availability

=== Design for Prosthetics ===
A key feature of prosthetics and prosthetic design is the idea of “designing for disabilities.” This might sound like a good idea in which people with disabilities can participate in equitable design but this is unfortunately not true. The idea of designing for disabilities is first problematic because of the underlying meaning of disabilities. It tells amputees that there is a right and wrong way to move and walk and that if amputees are adapted to the surrounding environment by their own means, then that is the wrong way. Along with that underlying meaning of disabilities, many people designing for disabilities are not actually disabled. “Design for disability&quot; from these experiences, takes disability as the object - with the feeling from non-disabled designers that they have properly learned about their job from their own simulation of the experience. The simulation is misleading and does a disservice to disabled people - so the design that flows from this is highly problematic. Engaging in disability design should be… with, ideally, team members who have the relevant disability and are part of communities that matter to the research. This leads to people, who do not know what the day-to-day personal experiences are, designing materials that do not meet the needs or hinder the needs of people with actual disabilities.

==Cost and source freedom==

===High-cost===
In the USA a typical prosthetic limb costs anywhere between $15,000 and $90,000, depending on the type of limb desired by the patient. With medical insurance, a patient will typically pay 10%–50% of the total cost of a prosthetic limb, while the insurance company will cover the rest of the cost. The percent that the patient pays varies on the type of insurance plan, as well as the limb requested by the patient. In the United Kingdom, much of Europe, Australia and New Zealand the entire cost of prosthetic limbs is met by state funding or statutory insurance. For example, in Australia prostheses are fully funded by state schemes in the case of amputation due to disease, and by workers compensation or traffic injury insurance in the case of most traumatic amputations. The National Disability Insurance Scheme, which is being rolled out nationally between 2017 and 2020 also pays for prostheses.

Transradial (below the elbow amputation) and transtibial prostheses (below the knee amputation) typically cost between US $6,000 and $8,000, while transfemoral (above the knee amputation) and transhumeral prosthetics (above the elbow amputation) cost approximately twice as much with a range of $10,000 to $15,000 and can sometimes reach costs of $35,000. The cost of an artificial limb often recurs, while a limb typically needs to be replaced every 3–4 years due to wear and tear of everyday use. In addition, if the socket has fit issues, the socket must be replaced within several months from the onset of pain. If height is an issue, components such as pylons can be changed.

Not only does the patient need to pay for their multiple prosthetic limbs, but they also need to pay for physical and occupational therapy that come along with adapting to living with an artificial limb. Unlike the reoccurring cost of the prosthetic limbs, the patient will typically only pay the $2000 to $5000 for therapy during the first year or two of living as an amputee. Once the patient is strong and comfortable with their new limb, they will not be required to go to therapy anymore. Throughout one&#x27;s life, it is projected that a typical amputee will go through $1.4 million worth of treatment, including surgeries, prosthetics, as well as therapies.

===Low-cost===

Low-cost above-knee prostheses often provide only basic structural support with limited function. This function is often achieved with crude, non-articulating, unstable, or manually locking knee joints. A limited number of organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), create devices for developing countries. Their device which is manufactured by CR Equipments is a single-axis, manually operated locking polymer prosthetic knee joint.

Table. List of knee joint technologies based on the literature review.


A plan for a low-cost artificial leg, designed by Sébastien Dubois, was featured at the 2007 International Design Exhibition and award show in Copenhagen, Denmark, where it won the . It would be able to create an energy-return prosthetic leg for US $8.00, composed primarily of fiberglass.

Prior to the 1980s, foot prostheses merely restored basic walking capabilities. These early devices can be characterized by a simple artificial attachment connecting one&#x27;s residual limb to the ground.

The introduction of the Seattle Foot (Seattle Limb Systems) in 1981 revolutionized the field, bringing the concept of an Energy Storing Prosthetic Foot (ESPF) to the fore. Other companies soon followed suit, and before long, there were multiple models of energy storing prostheses on the market. Each model utilized some variation of a compressible heel. The heel is compressed during initial ground contact, storing energy which is then returned during the latter phase of ground contact to help propel the body forward.

Since then, the foot prosthetics industry has been dominated by steady, small improvements in performance, comfort, and marketability.

With 3D printers, it is possible to manufacture a single product without having to have metal molds, so the costs can be drastically reduced.

&quot;Jaipur foot&quot;, an artificial limb from Jaipur, India, costs about US$40.

===Open-source robotic prosthesis===
There is currently an open-design Prosthetics forum known as the &quot;Open Prosthetics Project&quot;. The group employs collaborators and volunteers to advance Prosthetics technology while attempting to lower the costs of these necessary devices. Open Bionics is a company that is developing open-source robotic prosthetic hands. They utilize 3D printing to manufacture the devices and low-cost 3D scanners to fit them onto the residual limb of a specific patient. Open Bionics&#x27; use of 3D printing allows for more personalized designs, such as the &quot;Hero Arm&quot; which incorporates the users favourite colours, textures, and even aesthetics to look like superheroes or characters from &quot;Star Wars&quot; with the aim of lowering the cost. A review study on a wide range of printed prosthetic hands found that 3D printing technology holds a promise for individualised prosthesis design, is cheaper than commercial prostheses available on the market, and is more expensive than mass production processes such as injection molding. The same study also found that evidence on the functionality, durability and user acceptance of 3D printed hand prostheses is still lacking.

==Low-cost prosthetics for children==
In the USA an estimate was found of 32,500 children (&lt;21 years) had a major paediatric amputation, with 5,525 new cases each year, of which 3,315 congenital.

Carr et al. (1998) investigated amputations caused by landmines for Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia and Mozambique among children (&lt;14 years), showing estimates of respectively 4.7, 0.19, 1.11 and 0.67 per 1000 children. Mohan (1986) indicated in India a total of 424,000 amputees (23,500 annually), of which 10.3% had an onset of disability below the age of 14, amounting to a total of about 43,700 limb deficient children in India alone.

Few low-cost solutions have been created specially for children. Examples of low-cost prosthetic devices include:

===Pole and crutch===
This hand-held pole with leather support band or platform for the limb is one of the simplest and cheapest solutions found. It serves well as a short-term solution, but is prone to rapid contracture formation if the limb is not stretched daily through a series of range-of motion (RoM) sets.

===Bamboo, PVC or plaster limbs===
This also fairly simple solution comprises a plaster socket with a bamboo or PVC pipe at the bottom, optionally attached to a prosthetic foot. This solution prevents contractures because the knee is moved through its full RoM. The David Werner Collection, an online database for the assistance of disabled village children, displays manuals of production of these solutions.

===Adjustable bicycle limb===
This solution is built using a bicycle seat post up side down as foot, generating flexibility and (length) adjustability. It is a very cheap solution, using locally available materials.

===Sathi Limb===
It is an endoskeletal modular lower limb from India, which uses thermoplastic parts. Its main advantages are the small weight and adaptability.

===Monolimb===
Monolimbs are non-modular prostheses and thus require more experienced prosthetist for correct fitting, because alignment can barely be changed after production. However, their durability on average is better than low-cost modular solutions.

== Cultural and social theory perspectives ==
A number of theorists have explored the meaning and implications of prosthetic extension of the body. Elizabeth Grosz writes, &quot;Creatures use tools, ornaments, and appliances to augment their bodily capacities. Are their bodies lacking something, which they need to replace with artificial or substitute organs?...Or conversely, should prostheses be understood, in terms of aesthetic reorganization and proliferation, as the consequence of an inventiveness that functions beyond and perhaps in defiance of pragmatic need?&quot; Elaine Scarry argues that every artifact recreates and extends the body. Chairs supplement the skeleton, tools append the hands, clothing augments the skin. In Scarry&#x27;s thinking, &quot;furniture and houses are neither more nor less interior to the human body than the food it absorbs, nor are they fundamentally different from such sophisticated prosthetics as artificial lungs, eyes and kidneys. The consumption of manufactured things turns the body inside out, opening it up &quot;to&quot; and &quot;as&quot; the culture of objects.&quot; Mark Wigley, a professor of architecture, continues this line of thinking about how architecture supplements our natural capabilities, and argues that &quot;a blurring of identity is produced by all prostheses.&quot; Some of this work relies on Freud&#x27;s earlier characterization of man&#x27;s relation to objects as one of extension.

=== Negative social implications ===
Prosthetics play a vital role in how a person perceives themselves and how other people perceive them. The ability to conceal such use enabled participants to ward off social stigmatization that in turn enabled their social integration and the reduction of emotional problems surrounding such disability. People that lose a limb first have to deal with the emotional result of losing that limb. Regardless of the reasons for amputation, whether due to traumatic causes or as a consequence of illness, emotional shock exists. It may have a smaller or larger amplitude depending on a variety of factors such as patient age, medical culture, medical cause, etc. As a result of amputation, the research participants&#x27; reports were loaded with drama. The first emotional response to amputation was one of despair, a severe sense of self-collapse, something almost unbearable. Emotional factors are just a small part of looking at social implications. Many people who lose a limb may have lots of anxiety surrounding prosthetics and their limbs. After surgery, for an extended period of time, the interviewed patients from the National Library of Medicine noticed the appearance and increase of anxiety. A lot of negative thoughts invaded their minds. Projections about the future were grim, marked by sadness, helplessness, and even despair. Existential uncertainty, lack of control, and further anticipated losses in one&#x27;s life due to amputation were the primary causes of anxiety and consequently ruminations and insomnia. From losing a leg and getting a prosthetics there were also many factors that can happen including anger and regret. The amputation of a limb is associated not only with physical loss and change in body image but also with an abrupt severing in one&#x27;s sense of continuity. For participants with amputation as a result of physical trauma the event is often experienced as a transgression and can lead to frustration and anger.

=== Ethical concerns ===

There are also many ethical concerns about how the prosthetics are made and produced. A wide range of ethical issues arise in connection with experiments and clinical usage of sensory prostheses: animal experimentation; informed consent, for instance, in patients with a locked-in syndrome that may be alleviated with a sensory prosthesis; unrealistic expectations of research subjects testing new devices. How prosthetics come to be and testing of the usability of the device is a major concern in the medical world. Although many positives come when a new prosthetic design is announced, how the device got to where it is leads to some questioning the ethics of prosthetics.

=== Debates ===

There are also many debates among the prosthetic community about whether they should wear prosthetics at all. This is sparked by whether prosthetics help in day-to-day living or make it harder. Many people have adapted to their loss of limb making it work for them and do not need a prosthesis in their life. Not all amputees will wear a prosthesis. In a 2011 national survey of Australian amputees, Limbs 4 Life found that 7 percent of amputees do not wear a prosthesis, and in another Australian hospital study, this number was closer to 20 percent. Many people report being uncomfortable in prostheses and not wanting to wear them, even reporting that wearing a prosthetic is more cumbersome than not having one at all. These debates are natural among the prosthetic community and help us shed light on the issues that they are facing.

<text>August Hlond, SDB (5 July 1881 – 22 October 1948) was a Polish Salesian prelate who served as Archbishop of Poznań and Gniezno and as Primate of Poland. He was later appointed Archbishop of Gniezno and Warsaw and was made a cardinal of the Catholic Church by Pope Pius XI in 1927.

He was the only member of the College of Cardinals to be arrested and taken into custody by the Gestapo during World War II, and for the final years of his life was a critic of the Soviet-backed communist regime in Poland.

His cause of beatification commenced in 1992 and he was granted the title Servant of God. On 19 May 2018, he was named venerable after Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue.

== Early life and ordination==
Second son of a railway worker, he was born in the Upper Silesian village Brzęczkowice (), then ruled by Germany, now part of Mysłowice (), on 5 July 1881. At twelve-years-of-age, Hlond went to Turin, Italy to study for the priesthood in the Salesian Congregation. He later studied a doctorate of philosophy in Rome, returned to Poland to complete Theology, and was ordained in Krakow in 1905.

In 1909 Hlond was sent to Vienna to be headmaster at a boy&#x27;s secondary school. He remained in the city for 13 years, and working with spiritual and charitable organisations for Poles, and becoming Provincial of the Salesians for Austria, Hungary and Germany in 1919. Following the break up of Austria-Hungary after World War I, Pope Pius XI appointed Hlond as Apostolic Administrator for Polish Upper Silesia in 1922, and Hlond became the first Bishop of the Diocese of Katowice in 1925.

== Bishop and cardinal==
Hlond was consecrated as Bishop of Katowice on 3 January 1926. He succeeded Cardinal Edmund Dalbor, as Primate of Poland soon after and in 1927, was appointed Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria della Pace by Pope Pius XI. Through the tumultuous 1930s, Hlond condemned &quot;escapism&quot; and called on the Church should challenge the evil realities of the times, and, speaking 12 languages, became an influential member of the College of Cardinals on the international stage.

In 1932, together with Father Ignacy Posadzy founded the Society of Christ.

===World War II===
The invasion of predominantly Catholic Poland by Nazi Germany in 1939 ignited the Second World War. The Nazi plan for Poland entailed the destruction of the Polish nation, which necessarily required attacking the Polish Church, particularly in those areas annexed to Germany. In the territories annexed to Greater Germany, the Nazis set about systematically dismantling the Catholic Church - arresting its leaders, exiling its clergymen, closing its churches, monasteries and convents. Many clergymen were murdered. Elsewhere in occupied Poland, the suppression was less severe, though still harsh. The Papal Nuncio to Poland, Fillipo Cortesi 
, had abandoned Warsaw along with the diplomatic corps, after the invasion. Other channels existed for communications, including Cardinal Hlond.

On 18 September 1939, at the request of the Polish Government, Hlond left Poland, with part of the Army, in order to reach Rome and report on the actions of the Nazis in Poland, and inform the world via Vatican radio and press. Hlond submitted an official account of the persecutions of the Polish Church to the Vatican, reporting seizures of church property and abuse of clergy and nuns in the annexed regions:

In his final observations for Pope Pius XII, Hlond wrote:

In 1939 Hlond spent several months in Rome for the conclave of 1939. In January 1940, Vatican Radio broadcast Hlond&#x27;s reports of German persecution of Jews and the Catholic clergy in Poland. These reports were included in the report of the Polish government to the Nuremberg Trials after the war.

In March 1940, Hlond went on a pilgrimage to Lourdes, in France. Following the Fall of France, he remained in the country, staying at the Benedictine Abbey at Hautecombe, in Savoy, where remained, unable to leave, until Himmler ordered the Gestapo to arrest him in February 1944 (the only member of the Sacred College of Cardinals to be arrested by the Nazis). The Gestapo held him at their headquarters in Paris for two months, and, with the Soviet armies now driving the Nazis back from Russia, attempted to have him declare public support for the German war against the Soviet Union, in order to secure his release. The Gestapo offered to make Hlond Regent of Poland, but, according to The Tablet, &quot;The withdrawal of all German troops from Poland was necessary, the Cardinal implacably insisted, before he could even discuss any matter whatsoever with a German officer.&quot; Hlond remained in the custody of the Gestapo, first at a convent at Bar-le-Duc, until the Allied advance forced the Germans to shift him to Wiedenbrtick, in Westphalia, where he remained for seven months, until released by American troops in 1945. The Americans flew Hlond to Paris, and then to Rome on April 25, finally returning to war ravaged Poland on 20 July 1945.

Hlond reported in August 1941 to the Cardinal Secretary of State, Luigi Maglione, that the Polish people believed Pope Pius XII had abandoned them. This was said in light of the Nazi persecution of the Polish church and clergy.

===After the war===
Pope Pius XII appointed Hlond as Archbishop of Warsaw, on 4 March 1946 and he was installed on May 30, amid immense crowds of supporters. The Polish Church faced great challenges: thousands of Polish clergy had been killed by the Nazis, and the Church and the Soviet-sponsored new regime in Poland were soon to clash. Hlond set about placing bishops on the empty Sees and reconnecting the Church with Rome.

He spoke out against the Communist persecution of the Church. He issued a series of Pastoral Letters on behalf of the Polish Church regarding the new Poland, but these faced censorship at the hands of the new regime, and the government launched a nationalisation of church schools. In a May 1947 Pastoral Letter, Hlond wrote that &quot;Since the days of St. Peter, the Church has not been subjected to a persecution such as that to which she is subjected today&quot;. Following Hlond&#x27;s death in 1948, &quot;The Tablet&quot; wrote that &quot;the nations of Eastern Europe which lie today beneath the police-regimes imposed from Moscow lost their most powerful spokesman&quot;.

===Death and burial===
He was buried in the crypt of St. John&#x27;s cathedral in Warsaw. In March 2006 his body was transferred to the Chapel of St. John the Baptist.

== Controversies ==

===Relations with Polish Jews===
In 1936, Cardinal Hlond, as Primate of Poland issued a pastoral letter on Catholic moral principles. The long (5,600-word) letter covered Catholic ethics policy, ethics principles and a section on &quot;sins&quot; (&quot;Z Naszych Grzechów&quot;) that addressed Christian shortcomings to love one&#x27;s neighbours in accordance with God&#x27;s law. The latter section included a brief discussion of the &quot;Jewish problem&quot; (&quot;Problem żydowski&quot;):
So long as Jews remain Jews, a Jewish problem exists and will continue to exist (...) It is a fact that Jews are waging war against the Catholic church, that they are steeped in free-thinking, and constitute the vanguard of atheism, the Bolshevik movement, and revolutionary activity. It is a fact that Jews have a corruptive influence on morals and that their publishing houses are spreading pornography. It is true that Jews are perpetrating fraud, practicing usury, and dealing in prostitution. It is true that, from a religious and ethical point of view, Jewish youth are having a negative influence on the Catholic youth in our schools.
Hlond tempered these remarks with an admission that &quot;not all Jews are this way&quot; and forbade assaults on Jews or attacks on their property: 
There are very many Jews who are believers, honest, just, kind, and philanthropic. There is a healthy, edifying sense of family in very many Jewish homes. We know Jews who are ethically outstanding, noble, and upright. One may love one&#x27;s own nation more, but one may not hate anyone. Not even Jews. (...) it is forbidden to demolish a Jewish store, damage their merchandise, break windows, or throw things at their homes (...) it is forbidden to assault, beat up, maim, or slander Jews. One should honor and love Jews as human beings and neighbors
Yet, despite a warning to Catholics not to take an anti-Jewish moral stance, interspersed in the letter&#x27;s words of friendship was an explicit condemnation of Jewish culture and also Judaism for its rejection of Jesus Christ. 
It is good to prefer your own kind when shopping, to avoid Jewish stores and Jewish stalls in the marketplace (...) One should stay away from the harmful moral influence of Jews, keep away from their anti-Christian culture, and especially boycott the Jewish press and demoralizing Jewish publications. (...) We do not honor the indescribable tragedy of that nation, which was the guardian of the idea of the Messiah and from which was born the Savior. When divine mercy enlightens a Jew to sincerely accept his and our Messiah, let us greet him into our Christian ranks with joy.
Hlond&#x27;s letter was criticized by Polish Jewish groups who saw it as offering support and a rationalization for antisemitism.

Another controversy was caused by Hlond&#x27;s reaction to the Kielce pogrom, that took place in Polish town of Kielce on 4 July 1946. While condemning murders, Hlond denied the racist nature of this crime. He saw the pogrom as a reaction against Jewish bureaucrats allegedly serving Communist regime, a common excuse among Polish antisemites. This position was echoed by Cardinal Sapieha, who was reported to have said that the Jews brought it on themselves.

The American Jewish Committee questioned Pope Francis&#x27;s decision to name Hlond as Venerable in a letter sent to Cardinal Kurt Koch (the letter was also sent to the CCS and to Cardinal Pietro Parolin). The AJC noted that Hlond was anti-Semitic in his writings. The AJC&#x27;s letter further argued that, after the 1946 pogrom, Hlond called the Jewish victims communists and said they had themselves to blame.

===Removal of ethnic German bishops from Recovered Territories===
After 1945, Hlond has been known to force ethnic Germans to resign their church posts in favor of Poles, thereby supporting the Polish integration of formerly eastern German territories that had been given to Poland by the Allies as compensation for territory taken by the Soviet Union. Maximilian Kaller was one of the bishops who was removed from his diocese and deported to West Germany. Kaller is now in process of beatification. Another bishop forced out was Carl Maria Splett, Bishop of Danzig.

==Cause for beatification==
The process of beatification commenced in 1992 and he was granted the title of Servant of God. Professor Franz Scholz, a German theologian, as well as many others have expressed their opposition to the proposed beatification of Cardinal Hlond. Scholz opposes his actions against post-war German expellees and civilians from territories ceded by Allies to the Polish Republic.

Documentation (a &quot;Positio&quot;) was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (CCS) in 2008 and on 9 March 2017 a group of nine theologians approved naming Hlond &quot;Venerable&quot; with 8 votes in favor and 1 abstention. The members of the CCS approved the cause on 15 May 2018 and Pope Francis confirmed Hlond&#x27;s heroic virtue allowing Hlond to be named as Venerable on 19 May.

The current postulator for this cause is the Salesian priest Pierluigi Cameroni.

<doc id="72754" wikidata="Q165647" url="?curid=72754" title="Organic farming">
<text>Organic farming, also known as organic agriculture or ecological farming or biological farming, is an agricultural system that emphasizes the use of naturally occurring, non-synthetic inputs, such as compost manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation, companion planting, and mixed cropping. Biological pest control methods such as the fostering of insect predators are also encouraged. Organic agriculture can be defined as &quot;an integrated farming system that strives for sustainability, the enhancement of soil fertility and biological diversity while, with rare exceptions, prohibiting synthetic pesticides, antibiotics, synthetic fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, and growth hormones&quot;. It originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices. Certified organic agriculture accounted for globally in 2019, with over half of that total in Australia.

Organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or severely limiting synthetic substances. For instance, naturally occurring pesticides, such as garlic extract, bicarbonate of soda, or pyrethrin (which is found naturally in the &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; flower), are permitted, while synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, such as glyphosate, are prohibited. Synthetic substances that are allowed only in exceptional circumstances may include copper sulfate, elemental sulfur, and veterinary drugs. Genetically modified organisms, nanomaterials, human sewage sludge, plant growth regulators, hormones, and antibiotic use in livestock husbandry are prohibited. Broadly, organic agriculture is based on the principles of health, care for all living beings and the environment, ecology, and fairness. Organic methods champion sustainability, self-sufficiency, autonomy and independence, health, animal welfare, food security, and food safety. It is often seen as part of the solution to the impacts of climate change.

Organic agricultural methods are internationally regulated and legally enforced by transnational organizations such as the European Union and also by individual nations, based in large part on the standards set by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), an international umbrella organization for organic farming organizations established in 1972, with regional branches such as IFOAM Organics Europe and IFOAM Asia. Since 1990, the market for organic food and other products has grown rapidly, reaching $150 billion worldwide in 2022 – of which more than $64 billion was earned in North America and EUR 53 billion in Europe. This demand has driven a similar increase in organically managed farmland, which grew by 26.6 percent from 2021 to 2022. As of 2022, organic farming is practiced in 188 countries and approximately worldwide were farmed organically by 4.5 million farmers, representing approximately 2 percent of total world farmland.

== History ==

Agriculture was practiced for thousands of years without the use of artificial chemicals. Artificial fertilizers were first developed during the mid-19th century. These early fertilizers were cheap, powerful, and easy to transport in bulk. Similar advances occurred in chemical pesticides in the 1940s, leading to the decade being referred to as the &quot;pesticide era&quot;. These new agricultural techniques, while beneficial in the short-term, had serious longer-term side-effects, such as soil compaction, erosion, and declines in overall soil fertility, along with health concerns about toxic chemicals entering the food supply. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, soil biology scientists began to seek ways to remedy these side effects while still maintaining higher production.

In 1921 the founder and pioneer of the organic movement, Albert Howard, and his wife Gabrielle Howard accomplished botanists, founded an Institute of Plant Industry to improve traditional farming methods in India. Among other things, they brought improved implements and improved animal husbandry methods from their scientific training; then by incorporating aspects of Indian traditional methods, developed protocols for the rotation of crops, erosion prevention techniques, and the systematic use of composts and manures. Stimulated by these experiences of traditional farming, when Albert Howard returned to Britain in the early 1930s he began to promulgate a system of organic agriculture.

In 1924 Rudolf Steiner gave a series of eight lectures on agriculture with a focus on influences of the moon, planets, non-physical beings and elemental forces. They were held in response to a request by adherent farmers who noticed degraded soil conditions and a deterioration in the health and quality of crops and livestock resulting from the use of chemical fertilizers. The lectures were published in November 1924; the first English translation appeared in 1928 as &quot;The Agriculture Course&quot;.

In July 1939, Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, the author of the standard work on biodynamic agriculture (&quot;Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening&quot;), came to the UK at the invitation of Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne as a presenter at the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming at Northbourne&#x27;s farm in Kent. One of the chief purposes of the conference was to bring together the proponents of various approaches to organic agriculture in order that they might cooperate within a larger movement. Howard attended the conference, where he met Pfeiffer. In the following year, Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming, &quot;Look to the Land&quot;, in which he coined the term &quot;organic farming&quot;. The Betteshanger conference has been described as the &#x27;missing link&#x27; between biodynamic agriculture and other forms of organic farming.

In 1940, Howard published his &quot;An Agricultural Testament&quot;. In this book he adopted Northbourne&#x27;s terminology of &quot;organic farming&quot;. Howard&#x27;s work spread widely, and he became known as the &quot;father of organic farming&quot; for his work in applying scientific knowledge and principles to various traditional and natural methods. In the United States J. I. Rodale, who was keenly interested both in Howard&#x27;s ideas and in biodynamics, founded in the 1940s both a working organic farm for trials and experimentation, The Rodale Institute, and Rodale, Inc., in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, to teach and advocate organic methods to the wider public. These became important influences on the spread of organic agriculture. Further work was done by Lady Eve Balfour (the Haughley Experiment) in the United Kingdom, and many other places across the world.

The term &quot;eco-agriculture&quot; was coined in 1970 by Charles Walters, founder of &quot;Acres Magazine&quot;, to describe agriculture which does not use &quot;man-made molecules of toxic rescue chemistry&quot;, effectively another name for organic agriculture.

Increasing environmental awareness in the general population in modern times has transformed the originally supply-driven organic movement to a demand-driven one. Premium prices and some government subsidies attracted farmers. In the developing world, many producers farm according to traditional methods that are comparable to organic farming, but not certified, and that may not include the latest scientific advancements in organic agriculture. In other cases, farmers in the developing world have converted to modern organic methods for economic reasons.

===Terminology===
The use of &quot;organic&quot; popularized by Howard and Rodale refers more narrowly to the use of organic matter derived from plant compost and animal manures to improve the humus content of soils, grounded in the work of early soil scientists who developed what was then called &quot;humus farming&quot;. Since the early 1940s the two camps have tended to merge.

Biodynamic agriculturists, on the other hand, used the term &quot;organic&quot; to indicate that a farm should be viewed as a living organism, in the sense of the following quotation:

They based their work on Steiner&#x27;s spiritually-oriented alternative agriculture which includes various esoteric concepts.

== Methods ==

Organic farming methods combine scientific knowledge of ecology and some modern technology with traditional farming practices based on naturally occurring biological processes. Organic farming methods are studied in the field of agroecology. While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically purified fertilizers, organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers. An example of a natural pesticide is pyrethrin, which is found naturally in the Chrysanthemum flower. The principal methods of organic farming include crop rotation, green manures and compost, biological pest control, and mechanical cultivation. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity: legumes are planted to fix nitrogen into the soil, natural insect predators are encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such as potassium bicarbonate and mulches are used to control disease and weeds. Genetically modified seeds and animals are excluded.

While organic is fundamentally different from conventional because of the use of carbon-based fertilizers compared with highly soluble synthetic based fertilizers and biological pest control instead of synthetic pesticides, organic farming and large-scale conventional farming are not entirely mutually exclusive. Many of the methods developed for organic agriculture have been borrowed by more conventional agriculture. For example, Integrated Pest Management is a multifaceted strategy that uses various organic methods of pest control whenever possible, but in conventional farming could include synthetic pesticides only as a last resort. Examples of beneficial insects that are used in organic farming include ladybugs and lacewings, both of which feed on aphids. The use of IPM lowers the possibility of pest developing resistance to pesticides that are applied to crops.

=== Crop diversity ===

Organic farming encourages crop diversity by promoting polyculture (multiple crops in the same space). Planting a variety of vegetable crops supports a wider range of beneficial insects, soil microorganisms, and other factors that add up to overall farm health. Crop diversity helps the environment to thrive and protects species from going extinct. The science of Agroecology has revealed the benefits of polyculture, which is often employed in organic farming. Agroecology is a scientific discipline that uses ecological theory to study, design, manage, and evaluate agricultural systems that are productive and resource-conserving, and that are also culturally sensitive, socially just, and economically viable.

Incorporating crop diversity into organic farming practices can have several benefits. For instance, it can help to increase soil fertility by promoting the growth of beneficial soil microorganisms. It can also help to reduce pest and disease pressure by creating a more diverse and resilient agroecosystem. Furthermore, crop diversity can help to improve the nutritional quality of food by providing a wider range of essential nutrients.

=== Soil management ===
Organic farming relies more heavily on the natural breakdown of organic matter than the average conventional farm, using techniques like green manure and composting, to replace nutrients taken from the soil by previous crops. This biological process, driven by microorganisms such as mycorrhiza and earthworms, releases nutrients available to plants throughout the growing season. Farmers use a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing fuel-intensive tillage, less soil organic matter is lost to the atmosphere. This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration, which reduces greenhouse gases and helps reverse climate change. Reducing tillage may also improve soil structure and reduce the potential for soil erosion.

Plants need a large number of nutrients in various quantities to flourish. Supplying enough nitrogen and particularly synchronization, so that plants get enough nitrogen at the time when they need it most, is a challenge for organic farmers. Crop rotation and green manure (&quot;cover crops&quot;) help to provide nitrogen through legumes (more precisely, the family Fabaceae), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis with rhizobial bacteria. Intercropping, which is sometimes used for insect and disease control, can also increase soil nutrients, but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required. Crop residues can be ploughed back into the soil, and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen, potentially aiding synchronization. Organic farmers also use animal manureand certain processed fertilizers, such as seed meal and various mineral powders such as rock phosphate and green sand, a naturally occurring form of potash that provides potassium. In some cases, pH may need to be amended. Natural pH amendments include lime and sulfur, but in the U.S. some compounds, such as iron sulfate, aluminum sulfate, magnesium sulfate, and soluble boron products are allowed in organic farming.

Mixed farms with both livestock and crops can operate as ley farms, whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixing forage grasses, such as white clover or alfalfa, 
and grows cash crops or cereals when fertility is established. Farms without livestock (&quot;stockless&quot;) may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility and may rely more on external inputs, such as imported manure, as well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested. Horticultural farms that grow fruits and vegetables in protected conditions often rely even more on external inputs. Manure is very bulky and is often not cost-effective to transport more than a short distance from the source. Manure for organic farms may become scarce if a sizable number of farms become organically managed.

=== Weed management ===

Organic weed management promotes weed suppression, rather than weed elimination, by enhancing crop competition and phytotoxic effects on weeds. Organic farmers integrate cultural, biological, mechanical, physical and chemical tactics to manage weeds without synthetic herbicides.

Organic standards require rotation of annual crops, meaning that a single crop cannot be grown in the same location without a different, intervening crop. Organic crop rotations frequently include weed-suppressive cover crops and crops with dissimilar life cycles to discourage weeds associated with a particular crop. Research is ongoing to develop organic methods to promote the growth of natural microorganisms that suppress the growth or germination of common weeds.

Other cultural practices used to enhance crop competitiveness and reduce weed pressure include selection of competitive crop varieties, high-density planting, tight row spacing, and late planting into warm soil to encourage rapid crop germination.

Mechanical and physical weed control practices used on organic farms can be broadly grouped as:

* Tillage - Turning the soil between crops to incorporate crop residues and soil amendments; remove existing weed growth and prepare a seedbed for planting; turning soil after seeding to kill weeds, including cultivation of row crops.
* Mowing and cutting - Removing top growth of weeds.
* Flame weeding and thermal weeding - Using heat to kill weeds.
* Mulching - Blocking weed emergence with organic materials, plastic films, or landscape fabric.

Some naturally sourced chemicals are allowed for herbicidal use. These include certain formulations of acetic acid (concentrated vinegar), corn gluten meal, and essential oils. A few selective bioherbicides based on fungal pathogens have also been developed. At this time, however, organic herbicides and bioherbicides play a minor role in the organic weed control toolbox.

Weeds can be controlled by grazing. For example, geese have been used successfully to weed a range of organic crops including cotton, strawberries, tobacco, and corn, reviving the practice of keeping cotton patch geese, common in the southern U.S. before the 1950s. Similarly, some rice farmers introduce ducks and fish to wet paddy fields to eat both weeds and insects.

=== Controlling other organisms ===


Organisms aside from weeds that cause problems on farms include arthropods (e.g., insects, mites), nematodes, fungi and bacteria. Practices include, but are not limited to:

Examples of predatory beneficial insects include minute pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs, and to a lesser extent ladybugs (which tend to fly away), all of which eat a wide range of pests. Lacewings are also effective, but tend to fly away. Praying mantis tend to move more slowly and eat less heavily. Parasitoid wasps tend to be effective for their selected prey, but like all small insects can be less effective outdoors because the wind controls their movement. Predatory mites are effective for controlling other mites.

Naturally derived insecticides allowed for use on organic farms include &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; (a bacterial toxin), pyrethrum (a chrysanthemum extract), spinosad (a bacterial metabolite), neem (a tree extract) and rotenone (a legume root extract). Fewer than 10% of organic farmers use these pesticides regularly; a 2003 survey found that only 5.3% of vegetable growers in California use rotenone while 1.7% use pyrethrum. These pesticides are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm. The main criterion for organic pesticides is that they are naturally derived, and some naturally derived substances have been controversial. Controversial natural pesticides include rotenone, copper, nicotine sulfate, and pyrethrums Rotenone and pyrethrum are particularly controversial because they work by attacking the nervous system, like most conventional insecticides. Rotenone is extremely toxic to fish and can induce symptoms resembling Parkinson&#x27;s disease in mammals. Although pyrethrum (natural pyrethrins) is more effective against insects when used with piperonyl butoxide (which retards degradation of the pyrethrins), organic standards generally do not permit use of the latter substance.

Naturally derived fungicides allowed for use on organic farms include the bacteria &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; and &quot;Bacillus pumilus&quot;; and the fungus &quot;Trichoderma harzianum&quot;. These are mainly effective for diseases affecting roots. Compost tea contains a mix of beneficial microbes, which may attack or out-compete certain plant pathogens, but variability among formulations and preparation methods may contribute to inconsistent results or even dangerous growth of toxic microbes in compost teas.

Some naturally derived pesticides are not allowed for use on organic farms. These include nicotine sulfate, arsenic, and strychnine.

Synthetic pesticides allowed for use on organic farms include insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils for insect management; and Bordeaux mixture, copper hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate for managing fungi. Copper sulfate and Bordeaux mixture (copper sulfate plus lime), approved for organic use in various jurisdictions, can be more environmentally problematic than some synthetic fungicides disallowed in organic farming. Similar concerns apply to copper hydroxide. Repeated application of copper sulfate or copper hydroxide as a fungicide may eventually result in copper accumulation to toxic levels in soil, and admonitions to avoid excessive accumulations of copper in soil appear in various organic standards and elsewhere. Environmental concerns for several kinds of biota arise at average rates of use of such substances for some crops. In the European Union, where replacement of copper-based fungicides in organic agriculture is a policy priority, research is seeking alternatives for organic production.

=== Livestock ===

Raising livestock and poultry, for meat, dairy and eggs, is another traditional farming activity that complements growing. Organic farms attempt to provide animals with natural living conditions and feed. Organic certification verifies that livestock are raised according to the USDA organic regulations throughout their lives. These regulations include the requirement that all animal feed must be certified organic.

Organic livestock may be, and must be, treated with medicine when they are sick, but drugs cannot be used to promote growth, their feed must be organic, and they must be pastured.

Also, horses and cattle were once a basic farm feature that provided labour, for hauling and plowing, fertility, through recycling of manure, and fuel, in the form of food for farmers and other animals. While today, small growing operations often do not include livestock, domesticated animals are a desirable part of the organic farming equation, especially for true sustainability, the ability of a farm to function as a self-renewing unit.

=== Genetic modification ===
A key characteristic of organic farming is the exclusion of genetically engineered plants and animals. On 19 October 1998, participants at IFOAM&#x27;s 12th Scientific Conference issued the Mar del Plata Declaration, where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms in organic food production and agriculture.

Although opposition to the use of any transgenic technologies in organic farming is strong, agricultural researchers Luis Herrera-Estrella and Ariel Alvarez-Morales continue to advocate integration of transgenic technologies into organic farming as the optimal means to sustainable agriculture, particularly in the developing world. Organic farmer Raoul Adamchak and geneticist Pamela Ronald write that many agricultural applications of biotechnology are consistent with organic principles and have significantly advanced sustainable agriculture.

Although GMOs are excluded from organic farming, there is concern that the pollen from genetically modified crops is increasingly penetrating organic and heirloom seed stocks, making it difficult, if not impossible, to keep these genomes from entering the organic food supply. Differing regulations among countries limits the availability of GMOs to certain countries, as described in the article on regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms.

=== Tools ===

Organic farmers use a number of traditional farm tools to do farming, and may make use of agricultural machinery in similar ways to conventional farming. In the developing world, on small organic farms, tools are normally constrained to hand tools and diesel powered water pumps.

== Standards ==

Standards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991 EU-Eco-regulation developed for European Union, which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU&#x27;s program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the National Organic Program (NOP). As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming (IFOAM 2007:11). In 2005 IFOAM created the Principles of Organic Agriculture, an international guideline for certification criteria. Typically the agencies accredit certification groups rather than individual farms.

Production materials used for the creation of USDA Organic certified foods require the approval of a NOP accredited certifier.

EU-organic production-regulation on &quot;organic&quot; food labels define &quot;organic&quot; primarily in terms of whether &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;artificial&quot; substances were allowed as inputs in the food production process.

=== Composting ===
Using manure as a fertilizer risks contaminating food with animal gut bacteria, including pathogenic strains of E. coli that have caused fatal poisoning from eating organic food. To combat this risk, USDA organic standards require that manure must be sterilized through high temperature thermophilic composting. If raw animal manure is used, 120 days must pass before the crop is harvested if the final product comes into direct contact with the soil. For products that do not directly contact soil, 90 days must pass prior to harvest.

In the US, the Organic Food Production Act of 1990 (OFPA) as amended, specifies that a farm can not be certified as organic if the compost being used contains any synthetic ingredients. The OFPA singles out commercially blended fertilizers [composts] disallowing the use of any fertilizer [compost] that contains prohibited materials.

== Economics ==
The economics of organic farming, a subfield of agricultural economics, encompasses the entire process and effects of organic farming in terms of human society, including social costs, opportunity costs, unintended consequences, information asymmetries, and economies of scale.

Labour input, carbon and methane emissions, energy use, eutrophication, acidification, soil quality, effect on biodiversity, and overall land use vary considerably between individual farms and between crops, making general comparisons between the economics of organic and conventional agriculture difficult.

In the European Union &quot;organic farmers receive more subsidies under agri-environment and animal welfare subsidies than conventional growers&quot;.

=== Geographic producer distribution ===

The markets for organic products are strongest in North America and Europe, which as of 2001 are estimated to have $6 and $8 billion respectively of the $20 billion global market. As of 2007 Australasia has 39% of the total organic farmland, including Australia&#x27;s but 97% of this land is sprawling rangeland (2007:35). US sales are 20x as much. Europe farms 23% of global organic farmland (), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean with 20% (). Asia has 9.5% while North America has 7.2%. Africa has 3%.

Besides Australia, the countries with the most organic farmland are Argentina (), China (), and the United States (). Much of Argentina&#x27;s organic farmland is pasture, like that of Australia (2007:42). Spain, Germany, Brazil (the world&#x27;s largest agricultural exporter), Uruguay, and England follow the United States in the amount of organic land (2007:26).

In the European Union (EU25) 3.9% of the total utilized agricultural area was used for organic production in 2005. The countries with the highest proportion of organic land were Austria (11%) and Italy (8.4%), followed by the Czech Republic and Greece (both 7.2%). The lowest figures were shown for Malta (0.2%), Poland (0.6%) and Ireland (0.8%).
In 2009, the proportion of organic land in the EU grew to 4.7%. The countries with the highest share of agricultural land were Liechtenstein (26.9%), Austria (18.5%) and Sweden (12.6%). 16% of all farmers in Austria produced organically in 2010. By the same year the proportion of organic land increased to 20%. In 2005, of land in Poland was under organic management. In 2012, were under organic production, and there were about 15,500 organic farmers; retail sales of organic products were EUR 80 million in 2011. As of 2012 organic exports were part of the government&#x27;s economic development strategy.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, agricultural inputs that had previously been purchased from Eastern bloc countries were no longer available in Cuba, and many Cuban farms converted to organic methods out of necessity. Consequently, organic agriculture is a mainstream practice in Cuba, while it remains an alternative practice in most other countries. Cuba&#x27;s organic strategy includes development of genetically modified crops; specifically corn that is resistant to the palomilla moth.

=== Growth ===

In 2001, the global market value of certified organic products was estimated at US$20 billion. By 2002, this was US$23 billion and by 2015 more than US$43 billion. By 2014, retail sales of organic products reached US$80 billion worldwide. North America and Europe accounted for more than 90% of all organic product sales. In 2018 Australia accounted for 54% of the world&#x27;s certified organic land with the country recording more than .

Organic agricultural land increased almost fourfold in 15 years, from in 1999 to in 2014. Between 2013 and 2014, organic agricultural land grew by worldwide, increasing in every region except Latin America. During this time period, Europe&#x27;s organic farmland increased to (+2.3%), Asia&#x27;s increased to (+4.7%), Africa&#x27;s increased to total (+4.5%), and North America&#x27;s increased to total (+1.1%). As of 2014, the country with the most organic land was Australia (), followed by Argentina (), and the United States (). Australia&#x27;s organic land area has increased at a rate of 16.5% per annum for the past eighteen years.

In 2013, the number of organic producers grew by almost 270,000, or more than 13%. By 2014, there were a reported 2.3 million organic producers in the world. Most of the total global increase took place in the Philippines, Peru, China, and Thailand. Overall, the majority of all organic producers are in India (650,000 in 2013), Uganda (190,552 in 2014), Mexico (169,703 in 2013) and the Philippines (165,974 in 2014).

In 2016, organic farming produced over of bananas, over of soybean, and just under of coffee.

=== Productivity ===

Studies comparing yields have had mixed results. These differences among findings can often be attributed to variations between study designs including differences in the crops studied and the methodology by which results were gathered.

A 2012 meta-analysis found that productivity is typically lower for organic farming than conventional farming, but that the size of the difference depends on context and in some cases may be very small. While organic yields can be lower than conventional yields, another meta-analysis published in Sustainable Agriculture Research in 2015, concluded that certain organic on-farm practices could help narrow this gap. Timely weed management and the application of manure in conjunction with legume forages/cover crops were shown to have positive results in increasing organic corn and soybean productivity.

Another meta-analysis published in the journal &quot;Agricultural Systems&quot; in 2011 analyzed 362 datasets and found that organic yields were on average 80% of conventional yields. The author&#x27;s found that there are relative differences in this yield gap based on crop type with crops like soybeans and rice scoring higher than the 80% average and crops like wheat and potato scoring lower. Across global regions, Asia and Central Europe were found to have relatively higher yields and Northern Europe relatively lower than the average.

====Long term studies====
A study published in 2005 compared conventional cropping, organic animal-based cropping, and organic legume-based cropping on a test farm at the Rodale Institute over 22 years. The study found that &quot;the crop yields for corn and soybeans were similar in the organic animal, organic legume, and conventional farming systems&quot;. It also found that &quot;significantly less fossil energy was expended to produce corn in the Rodale Institute&#x27;s organic animal and organic legume systems than in the conventional production system. There was little difference in energy input between the different treatments for producing soybeans. In the organic systems, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides were generally not used&quot;. As of 2013 the Rodale study was ongoing and a thirty-year anniversary report was published by Rodale in 2012.

A long-term field study comparing organic/conventional agriculture carried out over 21 years in Switzerland concluded that &quot;Crop yields of the organic systems averaged over 21 experimental years at 80% of the conventional ones. The fertilizer input, however, was 34 – 51% lower, indicating an efficient production. The organic farming systems used 20 – 56% less energy to produce a crop unit and per land area this difference was 36 – 53%. In spite of the considerably lower pesticide input the quality of organic products was hardly discernible from conventional analytically and even came off better in food preference trials and picture creating methods.&quot;

=== Profitability ===

In the United States, organic farming has been shown to be 2.7 to 3.8 times more profitable for the farmer than conventional farming when prevailing price premiums are taken into account. Globally, organic farming is 22–35% more profitable for farmers than conventional methods, according to a 2015 meta-analysis of studies conducted across five continents.

The profitability of organic agriculture can be attributed to a number of factors. First, organic farmers do not rely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide inputs, which can be costly. In addition, organic foods currently enjoy a price premium over conventionally produced foods, meaning that organic farmers can often get more for their yield.

The price premium for organic food is an important factor in the economic viability of organic farming. In 2013 there was a 100% price premium on organic vegetables and a 57% price premium for organic fruits. These percentages are based on wholesale fruit and vegetable prices, available through the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Economic Research Service. Price premiums exist not only for organic versus nonorganic crops, but may also vary depending on the venue where the product is sold: farmers&#x27; markets, grocery stores, or wholesale to restaurants. For many producers, direct sales at farmers&#x27; markets are most profitable because the farmer receives the entire markup, however this is also the most time and labour-intensive approach.

There have been signs of organic price premiums narrowing in recent years, which lowers the economic incentive for farmers to convert to or maintain organic production methods. Data from 22 years of experiments at the Rodale Institute found that, based on the current yields and production costs associated with organic farming in the United States, a price premium of only 10% is required to achieve parity with conventional farming. A separate study found that on a global scale, price premiums of only 5-7% were needed to break even with conventional methods. Without the price premium, profitability for farmers is mixed.

For markets and supermarkets organic food is profitable as well, and is generally sold at significantly higher prices than non-organic food.

=== Energy efficiency ===

Compared to conventional agriculture, the energy efficiency of organic farming depends upon crop type and farm size.

Two studies – both comparing organically- versus conventionally-farmed apples – declare contradicting results, one saying organic farming is more energy efficient, the other saying conventionally is more efficient.

It has generally been found that the labour input per unit of yield was higher for organic systems compared with conventional production.

=== Sales and marketing ===

Most sales are concentrated in developed nations. In 2008, 69% of Americans claimed to occasionally buy organic products, down from 73% in 2005. One theory for this change was that consumers were substituting &quot;local&quot; produce for &quot;organic&quot; produce.

=== Distributors ===

The USDA requires that distributors, manufacturers, and processors of organic products be certified by an accredited state or private agency. In 2007, there were 3,225 certified organic handlers, up from 2,790 in 2004.

Organic handlers are often small firms; 48% reported sales below $1 million annually, and 22% between $1 and $5 million per year. Smaller handlers are more likely to sell to independent natural grocery stores and natural product chains whereas large distributors more often market to natural product chains and conventional supermarkets, with a small group marketing to independent natural product stores. Some handlers work with conventional farmers to convert their land to organic with the knowledge that the farmer will have a secure sales outlet. This lowers the risk for the handler as well as the farmer. In 2004, 31% of handlers provided technical support on organic standards or production to their suppliers and 34% encouraged their suppliers to transition to organic. Smaller farms often join in cooperatives to market their goods more effectively.

93% of organic sales are through conventional and natural food supermarkets and chains, while the remaining 7% of U.S. organic food sales occur through farmers&#x27; markets, foodservices, and other marketing channels.

==== Direct-to-consumer sales ====

In the 2012 Census, direct-to-consumer sales equalled $1.3 billion, up from $812 million in 2002, an increase of 60 percent. The number of farms that utilize direct-to-consumer sales was 144,530 in 2012 in comparison to 116,733 in 2002. Direct-to-consumer sales include farmers&#x27; markets, community supported agriculture (CSA), on-farm stores, and roadside farm stands. Some organic farms also sell products direct to retailer, direct to restaurant and direct to institution. According to the 2008 Organic Production Survey, approximately 7% of organic farm sales were direct-to-consumers, 10% went direct to retailers, and approximately 83% went into wholesale markets. In comparison, only 0.4% of the value of convention agricultural commodities were direct-to-consumers.

While not all products sold at farmer&#x27;s markets are certified organic, this direct-to-consumer avenue has become increasingly popular in local food distribution and has grown substantially since 1994. In 2014, there were 8,284 farmer&#x27;s markets in comparison to 3,706 in 2004 and 1,755 in 1994, most of which are found in populated areas such as the Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast.

=== Labour and employment ===

Organic production is more labour-intensive than conventional production. Increased labour cost is one factor that contributes to organic food being more expensive. Organic farming&#x27;s increased labour requirements can be seen in a good way providing more job opportunities for people. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report suggests that &quot;[a]n increase in investment in green agriculture is projected to lead to growth in employment of about 60 per cent compared with current levels&quot; and that &quot;green agriculture investments could create 47 million additional jobs compared with BAU2 over the next 40 years&quot;.

Much of the growth in women labour participation in agriculture is outside the &quot;male dominated field of conventional agriculture&quot;. Organic farming has a greater percentage of women working in the farms with 21% compared to farming in general with 14%.

=== World&#x27;s food security ===

In 2007 the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said that organic agriculture often leads to higher prices and hence a better income for farmers, so it should be promoted. However, FAO stressed that organic farming could not feed the current human population, much less the larger future population. Both data and models showed that organic farming was far from sufficient. Therefore, chemical fertilizers were needed to avoid hunger. Others have argued that organic farming is particularly well-suited to food-insecure areas, and therefore could be &quot;an important part of increased food security&quot; in places like sub-Saharan Africa

FAO stressed that fertilizers and other chemical inputs can increase production, particularly in Africa where fertilizers are currently used 90% less than in Asia. For example, in Malawi the yield has been boosted using seeds and fertilizers.

Also NEPAD, a development organization of African governments, announced that feeding Africans and preventing malnutrition requires fertilizers and enhanced seeds.

According to a 2012 study from McGill University, organic best management practices show an average yield only 13% less than conventional. In the world&#x27;s poorer nations where most of the world&#x27;s hungry live, and where conventional agriculture&#x27;s expensive inputs are not affordable for the majority of farmers, adopting organic management actually increases yields 93% on average, and could be an important part of increased food security.

=== Capacity building in developing countries ===

Organic agriculture can contribute to ecological sustainability, especially in poorer countries. The application of organic principles enables employment of local resources (e.g., local seed varieties, manure, etc.) and therefore cost-effectiveness. Local and international markets for organic products show tremendous growth prospects and offer creative producers and exporters excellent opportunities to improve their income and living conditions.

Organic agriculture is knowledge intensive. Globally, capacity building efforts are underway, including localized training material, to limited effect. As of 2007, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements hosted more than 170 free manuals and 75 training opportunities online.

In 2008 the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) stated that &quot;organic agriculture can be more conducive to food security in Africa than most conventional production systems, and that it is more likely to be sustainable in the long-term&quot; and that &quot;yields had more than doubled where organic, or near-organic practices had been used&quot; and that soil fertility and drought resistance improved.

==== Millennium Development Goals ====

The value of organic agriculture (OA) in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), particularly in poverty reduction efforts in the face of climate change, is shown by its contribution to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These benefits are expected to continue in the post-MDG era. A series of case studies conducted in selected areas in Asian countries by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and published as a book compilation by ADB in Manila document these contributions to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These include poverty alleviation by way of higher incomes, improved farmers&#x27; health owing to less chemical exposure, integration of sustainable principles into rural development policies, improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, and expansion of global partnership for development as small farmers are integrated in value chains.

A related ADBI study also sheds on the costs of OA programs and set them in the context of the costs of attaining the MDGs. The results show considerable variation across the case studies, suggesting that there is no clear structure to the costs of adopting OA. Costs depend on the efficiency of the OA adoption programs. The lowest cost programs were more than ten times less expensive than the highest cost ones. However, further analysis of the gains resulting from OA adoption reveals that the costs per person taken out of poverty was much lower than the estimates of the World Bank, based on income growth in general or based on the detailed costs of meeting some of the more quantifiable MDGs (e.g., education, health, and environment).

=== Externalities ===

Agriculture imposes negative externalities upon society through public land and other public resource use, biodiversity loss, erosion, pesticides, nutrient pollution, and assorted other problems. Positive externalities include self-reliance, entrepreneurship, respect for nature, and air quality. Organic methods differ from conventional methods in the impacts of their respective externalities, dependent on implementation and crop type. Overall land use is generally higher for organic methods, but organic methods generally use less energy in production. The analysis and comparison of externalities is complicated by whether the comparison is done using a per unit area measurement or per unit of production, and whether analysis is done on isolated plots or on farm units as a whole.

Measurements of biodiversity are highly variable between studies, farms, and organism groups. &quot;Birds, predatory insects, soil organisms and plants responded positively to organic farming, while non-predatory insects and pests did not. A 2005 review found that the positive effects of organic farming on abundance were prominent at the plot and field scales, but not for farms in matched landscapes.&quot;

Other studies that have attempted to examine and compare conventional and organic systems of farming and have found that organic techniques reduce levels of biodiversity less than conventional systems do, and use less energy and produce less waste when calculated per unit area, although not when calculated per unit of output. &quot;Farm comparisons show that actual (nitrate) leaching rates per hectare[/acre] are up to 57% lower on organic than on conventional fields. However, the leaching rates per unit of output were similar or slightly higher.&quot; &quot;On a per-hectare[/-acre] scale, the CO2 emissions are 4060% lower in organic farming systems than in conventional ones, whereas on a per-unit output scale, the CO2 emissions tend to be higher in organic farming systems.&quot;

It has been proposed that organic agriculture can reduce the level of some negative externalities from (conventional) agriculture. Whether the benefits are private, or public depends upon the division of property rights.

== Issues ==

According to a meta analysis published in 2017, compared to conventional agriculture, biological agriculture has a higher land requirement per yield unit, a higher eutrophication potential, a higher acidification potential and a lower energy requirement, but is associated with similarly high greenhouse gas emissions.

A 2003 to 2005 investigation by the Cranfield University for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the UK found that it is difficult to compare the global warming potential, acidification and eutrophication emissions but &quot;Organic production often results in increased burdens, from factors such as nitrogen leaching and N2O emissions&quot;, even though primary energy use was less for most organic products. N2O is always the largest global warming potential contributor except in tomatoes. However, &quot;organic tomatoes always incur more burdens (except pesticide use)&quot;. Some emissions were lower &quot;per area&quot;, but organic farming always required 65 to 200% more field area than non-organic farming. The numbers were highest for bread wheat (200+ % more) and potatoes (160% more).

As of 2020 it seems that organic agriculture can help in mitigating climate change but only if used in certain ways.

=== Environmental impact and emissions ===

Researchers at Oxford University analysed 71 peer-reviewed studies and observed that organic products are sometimes worse for the environment. Organic milk, cereals, and pork generated higher greenhouse gas emissions per product than conventional ones but organic beef and olives had lower emissions in most studies. Usually organic products required less energy, but more land. Per unit of product, organic produce generates higher nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions, ammonia emissions, eutrophication, and acidification potential than conventionally grown produce. Other differences were not significant. The researchers concluded that public debate should consider various manners of employing conventional or organic farming, and not merely debate conventional farming as opposed to organic farming. They also sought to find specific solutions to specific circumstances.

A 2018 review article in the &quot;Annual Review of Resource Economics&quot; found that organic agriculture is more polluting per unit of output and that widespread upscaling of organic agriculture would cause additional loss of natural habitats.

Proponents of organic farming have claimed that organic agriculture emphasizes closed nutrient cycles, biodiversity, and effective soil management providing the capacity to mitigate and even reverse the effects of climate change and that organic agriculture can decrease fossil fuel emissions. &quot;The carbon sequestration efficiency of organic systems in temperate climates is almost double () that of conventional treatment of soils, mainly owing to the use of grass clovers for feed and of cover crops in organic rotations.&quot; However, studies acknowledge organic systems require more acreage to produce the same yield as conventional farms. By converting to organic farms in developed countries where most arable land is accounted for, increased deforestation would decrease overall carbon sequestration.

=== Nutrient leaching ===

According to a 2012 meta-analysis of 71 studies, nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions, ammonia emissions, eutrophication potential and acidification potential were higher for organic products. Specifically, the emission per area of land is lower, but per amount of food produced is higher. This is due to the lower crop yield of organic farms. Excess nutrients in lakes, rivers, and groundwater can cause algal blooms, eutrophication, and subsequent dead zones. In addition, nitrates are harmful to aquatic organisms by themselves.

=== Land use ===

A 2012 Oxford meta-analysis of 71 studies found that organic farming requires 84% more land for an equivalent amount of harvest, mainly due to lack of nutrients but sometimes due to weeds, diseases or pests, lower yielding animals and land required for fertility building crops. While organic farming does not necessarily save land for wildlife habitats and forestry in all cases, the most modern breakthroughs in organic are addressing these issues with success.

Professor Wolfgang Branscheid says that organic animal production is not good for the environment, because organic chicken requires twice as much land as &quot;conventional&quot; chicken and organic pork a quarter more. According to a calculation by Hudson Institute, organic beef requires three times as much land. On the other hand, certain organic methods of animal husbandry have been shown to restore desertified, marginal, and/or otherwise unavailable land to agricultural productivity and wildlife. Or by getting both forage and cash crop production from the same fields simultaneously, reduce net land use.

SRI methods for rice production, without external inputs, have produced record yields on some farms, but not others.

=== Pesticides ===
In organic farming the use of synthetic pesticides and certain natural compounds that are produced using chemical synthesis are prohibited. The organic labels restrictions are not only based on the nature of the compound, but also on the method of production.

A non-exhaustive list of organic approved pesticides with their median lethal doses:

* Boric acid is used as an insecticide (LD50: 2660 mg/kg).
* Copper(II) sulfate is used as a fungicide and is also used in conventional agriculture (LD50 300 mg/kg). Conventional agriculture has the option to use the less toxic Mancozeb (LD50 4,500 to 11,200 mg/kg)
* Lime sulfur (aka calcium polysulfide) and sulfur are considered to be allowed, synthetic materials (LD50: 820 mg/kg)
* Neem oil is used as an insect repellant in India; since it contains azadirachtin its use is restricted in the UK and Europe.
* Pyrethrin comes from chemicals extracted from flowers of the genus &quot;Pyrethrum&quot; (LD50 of 370 mg/kg). Its potent toxicity is used to control insects.

=== Food quality and safety ===

While there may be some differences in the amounts of nutrients and anti-nutrients when organically produced food and conventionally-produced food are compared, the variable nature of food production and handling makes it difficult to generalize results, and there is insufficient evidence to make claims that organic food is safer or healthier than conventional food.

=== Soil conservation ===

Supporters claim that organically managed soil has a higher quality and higher water retention. This may help increase yields for organic farms in drought years. Organic farming can build up soil organic matter better than conventional no-till farming, which suggests long-term yield benefits from organic farming. An 18-year study of organic methods on nutrient-depleted soil concluded that conventional methods were superior for soil fertility and yield for nutrient-depleted soils in cold-temperate climates, arguing that much of the benefit from organic farming derives from imported materials that could not be regarded as self-sustaining.

In &quot;Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations&quot;, geomorphologist David Montgomery outlines a coming crisis from soil erosion. Agriculture relies on roughly one meter of topsoil, and that is being depleted ten times faster than it is being replaced. No-till farming, which some claim depends upon pesticides, is one way to minimize erosion. However, a 2007 study by the USDA&#x27;s Agricultural Research Service has found that manure applications in tilled organic farming are better at building up the soil than no-till.

Gunsmoke Farms, a organic farming project in South Dakota, suffered from massive soil erosion as result of tiling after it switched to organic farming.

=== Biodiversity ===
The conservation of natural resources and biodiversity is a core principle of organic production. Three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife. Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects, provide habitat for birds and mammals, and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems. Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include: 1) decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs; 2) reduced pest-management costs; 3) more reliable sources of clean water; and 4) better pollination.

Nearly all non-crop, naturally occurring species observed in comparative farm land practice studies show a preference for organic farming both by abundance and diversity. An average of 30% more species inhabit organic farms. Birds, butterflies, soil microbes, beetles, earthworms, spiders, vegetation, and mammals are particularly affected. Lack of herbicides and pesticides improve biodiversity fitness and population density. Many weed species attract beneficial insects that improve soil qualities and forage on weed pests. Soil-bound organisms often benefit because of increased bacteria populations due to natural fertilizer such as manure, while experiencing reduced intake of herbicides and pesticides. Increased biodiversity, especially from beneficial soil microbes and mycorrhizae have been proposed as an explanation for the high yields experienced by some organic plots, especially in light of the differences seen in a 21-year comparison of organic and control fields.

Organic farming contributes to human capital by promoting biodiversity. The presence of various species in organic farms helps to reduce human input, such as fertilizers, and pesticides, which enhances sustainability.

The USDA&#x27;s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) published a &quot;Federal Register&quot; notice on 15 January 2016, announcing the National Organic Program (NOP) final guidance on Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation for Certified Organic Operations. Given the broad scope of natural resources which includes soil, water, wetland, woodland and wildlife, the guidance provides examples of practices that support the underlying conservation principles and demonstrate compliance with USDA organic regulations § 205.200. The final guidance provides organic certifiers and farms with examples of production practices that support conservation principles and comply with the USDA organic regulations, which require operations to maintain or improve natural resources. The final guidance also clarifies the role of certified operations (to submit an OSP to a certifier), certifiers (ensure that the OSP describes or lists practices that explain the operator&#x27;s monitoring plan and practices to support natural resources and biodiversity conservation), and inspectors (onsite inspection) in the implementation and verification of these production practices.

A wide range of organisms benefit from organic farming, but it is unclear whether organic methods confer greater benefits than conventional integrated agri-environmental programs. Organic farming is often presented as a more biodiversity-friendly practice, but the generality of the beneficial effects of organic farming is debated as the effects appear often species- and context-dependent, and current research has highlighted the need to quantify the relative effects of local- and landscape-scale management on farmland biodiversity. There are four key issues when comparing the impacts on biodiversity of organic and conventional farming: (1) It remains unclear whether a holistic whole-farm approach (i.e. organic) provides greater benefits to biodiversity than carefully targeted prescriptions applied to relatively small areas of cropped and/or non-cropped habitats within conventional agriculture (i.e. agri-environment schemes); (2) Many comparative studies encounter methodological problems, limiting their ability to draw quantitative conclusions; (3) Our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming in pastoral and upland agriculture is limited; (4) There remains a pressing need for longitudinal, system-level studies in order to address these issues and to fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming, before a full appraisal of its potential role in biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems can be made.

=== Labour standards ===
Organic agriculture is often considered to be more socially just and economically sustainable for farmworkers than conventional agriculture. However, there is little social science research or consensus as to whether or not organic agriculture provides better working conditions than conventional agriculture. As many consumers equate organic and sustainable agriculture with small-scale, family-owned organizations it is widely interpreted that buying organic supports better conditions for farmworkers than buying with conventional producers. Organic agriculture is generally more labour-intensive due to its dependence on manual practices for fertilization and pest removal. Although illnesses from inputs pose less of a risk, hired workers still fall victim to debilitating musculoskeletal disorders associated with agricultural work. The USDA certification requirements outline growing practices and ecological standards but do nothing to codify labour practices. Independent certification initiatives such as the Agricultural Justice Project, Domestic Fair Trade Working Group, and the Food Alliance have attempted to implement farmworker interests but because these initiatives require voluntary participation of organic farms, their standards cannot be widely enforced. Despite the benefit to farmworkers of implementing labour standards, there is little support among the organic community for these social requirements. Many actors of the organic industry believe that enforcing labour standards would be unnecessary, unacceptable, or unviable due to the constraints of the market.

== Regional support for organic farming ==
The following is a selected list of support given in some regions.

===Europe ===
The EU-organic production-regulation is a part of the European Union regulation that sets rules about the production of organic agricultural and livestock products and how to label them. In the EU, organic farming and organic food are more commonly known as ecological or biological.

The regulation is derived from the guidelines of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), which is an association of about 800 member organizations in 119 countries.

As in the rest of the world, the organic market in Europe continues to grow and more land is farmed organically each year. &quot;More farmers cultivate organically, more land is certified organic, and more countries report organic farming activities&quot; as per the 2016 edition of the study &quot;The World of Organic Agriculture &quot; according to data from the end of 2014 published by FiBL and IFOAM in 2016.

==== Denmark ====
Denmark has a long ongoing support for converting conventional farming into organic farming, which has been taught in academic classes in universities since 1986. The state began substitutes and has promoted a special national label for products that qualify as organic since 1989. Denmark is thus the first country in the world to substitute organic farming, promoting the concept and organizing the distribution of organic products. Today the government accept applicants for financial support during conversion years, as in Danish regulations farms must not have utilized conventional farming methods such as the usage of pesticides for several years before products can be assessed for qualification as organic. This financial support has in recent years been cut due to organic farming increasing in profitability, and some goods surpassing the profitability of conventional farming in domestic markets. In general, the financial situation of organic farmers in Denmark boomed between 2010 and 2018, while in 2018 serious nationwide long-lasting droughts stagnated the economic results of organic farmers; however, the average farmer still achieved a net positive result that year. In 2021 Denmark&#x27;s (and Europe&#x27;s) largest slaughterhouse, Danish Crown, publicized its expectations of stagnating sales of conventional pork domestically, however it expected increasing sales of organic pork and especially free range organic pork. Besides the conversion support, there are still base subsidies for organic farming paid per area of qualified farm land.

The first Danish private development organisation, SamsØkologisk, was established in 2013, by veteran organic farmers from the existing organisation Økologisk Samsø. The development organisation has intentions to buy and invest in farmland and then lend the land to young and aspiring farmers seeking to get into farming, especially organic farming. This organisation reports 300 economical active members as of 2021, but does not publish the amount of acquired land or active lenders.

However, the organic farming concept in Denmark is often not limited to organic farming as the definition is globally. Instead, the majority of organic farming is instead &quot;ecological farming&quot;. The development of this concept has been parallel with the general organic farming movement, and is most often used interchangeable with organic farming. Thus, there is a much stronger focus on the environmental and especially the ecological impact of ecological farming than organic farming. E.g. besides the base substitute for organic farming, farmers can qualify for an extra substitute equal to 2/3 of the base for realizing a specific reduction in the usage of added nitrogen to the farmland (also by organic means). There are also parallels to the extended organic movements of regenerative agriculture, although far from all concepts in regenerative agriculture are included in the national strategy at this time, but exist as voluntary options for each farmer. For these reasons, international organic products do not fulfill the requirements of ecological farming and thus do not receive the domestic label for ecological products, rather they receive the standard European Union organic label.

==== Ukraine ====
The Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine is the central executive body that develops the regulatory framework for the organic sector in Ukraine, maintains the state registers of certification bodies, operators and organic seeds and planting material, and provides training and professional development for organic inspectors.

Thanks to the hard work on organic legislation by the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine and the organic working group that includes the main players of the Ukraine&#x27;s organic sector, on 10 July 2018, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine (the Ukrainian Parliament) adopted the Law of Ukraine “On Basic Principles and Requirements for Organic Production, Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products” No. 2496, which was enacted on 2 August 2019. As of April 2024, organic production, circulation and labelling of organic products in Ukraine is regulated by this law as well as relevant by-laws.

One more important governmental institution of the organic sector of Ukraine is the State Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection. It is the central executive body authorised to conduct state supervision (control) in the field of organic production, circulation and labelling of organic products in accordance with the organic legislation of Ukraine. This includes state supervision (control) over compliance with the legislation in the field of organic production, circulation and labelling of organic products: inspection of certification bodies; random inspection of operators; monitoring of organic products on the market to prevent the entry of non-organic products labelled as organic.

The State Institution “Entrepreneurship and Export Promotion Office” (EEPO, Ukraine) contributes to the development of the Ukrainian organic exporters’ potential, promotion of the organic sector and formation of a positive image of Ukraine as a reliable supplier of organic products abroad. EEPO actively supports and organises various events for organic exporters, including national pavilions at key international trade fairs, such as BIOFACH (Nuremberg, Germany), Anuga (Cologne, Germany), SIAL (Paris, France), and Middle East Organic &amp; Natural Products Expo (Dubai, UAE). EEPO also created the Catalogue of Ukrainian Exporters of Organic Products in partnership with Organic Standard certification body.

Organic farming is Ukraine is also supported by international technical assistance projects and programmes implementation of which is funded and supported by Switzerland, Germany, and other countries. These project/programmes are the Swiss-Ukrainian program “Higher Value Added Trade from the Organic and Dairy Sector in Ukraine” (QFTP), financed by Switzerland and implemented by the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL, Switzerland) in partnership with SAFOSO AG (Switzerland); the Swiss-Ukrainian program “Organic Trade for Development in Eastern Europe” (OT4D), financed by Switzerland through the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and implemented by IFOAM – Organics International in partnership HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation and the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL, Switzerland); Project “German-Ukrainian Cooperation in Organic Agriculture” (COA).

The project/programme representatives provide their expertise during development of the organic legislative framework and implementation of the legislation in the field of organic production, circulation and labelling of organic products and support various activities related to organic farming and production.

===China===

The Chinese government, especially the local government, has provided various supports for the development of organic agriculture since the 1990s. Organic farming has been recognized by local governments for its potential in promoting sustainable rural development. It is common for local governments to facilitate land access of agribusinesses by negotiating land leasing with local farmers. The government also establishes demonstration organic gardens, provides training for organic food companies to pass certifications, subsidizes organic certification fees, pest repellent lamps, organic fertilizer and so on. The government has also been playing an active role in marketing organic products through organizing organic food expos and branding supports.

===India===

In India, in 2016, the northern state of Sikkim achieved its goal of converting to 100% organic farming. Other states of India, including Kerala, Mizoram, Goa, Rajasthan, and Meghalaya, have also declared their intentions to shift to fully organic cultivation.

The South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh is also promoting organic farming, especially Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF), which is a form of regenerative agriculture.

As of 2018, India has the largest number of organic farmers in the world and constitutes more than 30% of organic farmers globally. India has 835,000 certified organic producers. However, the total land under organic cultivation is around 2% of overall farmland.The current level food production is 1.5 times greater than what’s needed to feed the world. It is thus sufficient to feed 10 billion people which is the projected population peak of 2050 (Holt-Gimenez, 2012). Yet one in nine people remain hungry in the world today (FAO, IFAD, and WFP, 2015).

===Dominican Republic===

The Dominican Republic has successfully converted a large amount of its banana crop to organic. The Dominican Republic accounts for 55% of the world&#x27;s certified organic bananas.

=== South Korea ===
The most noticeable change in Korea&#x27;s agriculture occurred throughout the 1960s and 1970s. More specifically, the &quot;Green Revolution&quot; program where South Korea experienced reforestations and agricultural revolution. Due to a food shortage during Park Chung Hee&#x27;s presidency, the government encouraged rice varieties suited for organic farming. Farmers were able to strategize risk minimization efforts by breeding a variety of rice called Japonica with Tongil. They also used less fertilizer and made other economic adjustments to alleviate potential risk factors.

In modern society, organic farming and food policies have changed, more specifically since the 1990s. As expected, the guidelines focus on basic dietary recommendations for consumption of nutrients and Korean-style diets. The main reason for this encouragement is that around 88% of countries across the world face forms of malnutrition. Then in 2009, the Special Act on Safety Management of Children&#x27;s Dietary Life was passed, restricting foods low in energy and poor in nutrients. It also focused on other nutritional problems Korean students may have had as well.

=== Thailand ===
In Thailand, the (ISAC) was established in 1991 to promote organic farming (among other sustainable agricultural practices). The national target via the National Plan for Organic Farming is to attain, by 2021, of organically farmed land. Another target is for 40% of the produce from these farmlands to be consumed domestically.

Much progress has been made:

* Many organic farms have sprouted, growing produce ranging from mangosteen to stinky bean. 
* Some of the farms have also established education centres to promote and share their organic farming techniques and knowledge. 
* In Chiang Mai Province, there are 18 organic markets. (ISAC-linked)

=== United States ===
The United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development (USDARD) was created in 1994 as a subsection of the USDA that implements programs to stimulate growth in rural communities. One of the programs that the USDARD created provided grants to farmers who practiced organic farming through the Organic Certification Cost Share Program (OCCSP). During the 21st century, the United States has continued to expand its reach in the organic foods market, doubling the number of organic farms in the U.S. in 2016 when compared to 2011.

Employment on organic farms offers potentially large numbers of jobs for people, and this may better manage the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Moreover, sustainable forestry, fishing, and mining, and other conservation-oriented activities provide larger numbers of jobs than more fossil fuel and mechanized work.

* Organic Farming has grown by in the U.S. from 2000 to 2011.
* In 2016, California had 2,713 organic farms, which makes California the largest producer of organic goods in the U.S.
* 4% of food sales in the U.S. are of organic goods.

=== Sri Lanka ===
As was the case with most countries, Sri Lanka made the transition away from organic farming upon the arrival of the Green Revolution, whereupon it started depending more on chemical fertilizers. This became a highly popularized method when the nation started offering subsidies on the import of artificial fertilizers to increase rice paddy production, and to incentivize farmers to switch from growing traditional varieties into using high yielding varieties (HYVs). This was especially true for young farmers who saw short-term economic profit as more sustainable to their wellbeing, compared to the long term drawbacks to the environment. However, due to the various health concerns with inorganic farming including the possibility of a chronic kidney disease being associated with chemical fertilizers, many middle aged and experienced farmers displayed skepticism towards these new approaches. Some even resorted to organic farming or utilizing insecticide free fertilizers for their crops. In a study conducted by F. Horgan and E. Kudavidanage, the researchers compared crop yields of farmers in Sri Lanka who employed distinct farming techniques including organic farmers who grew traditional varieties, and insecticide-free fertilizer users and pesticide users who grew modern varieties. No significant difference was found among the yield productions and in fact, organic farmers and insecticide-free fertilizer users lamented less about insects such as planthoppers as a challenge to their production. Regardless, many farmers continued to use insecticides to avoid the predicted dangers of pests to their crops, and the cheap sale of agrochemicals provided an easy approach to augment crop growth. Additionally, while organic farming has health benefits, it&#x27;s a strenuous task which requires more man power. Although that presented a great opportunity for increased employment in Sri Lanka, the economic compensation was not enough to suffice the living expenses of those employed. Thus, most farmers relied on modern methods to run their household, especially after the economic stressors brought on by COVID-19.

However, while Sri Lanka was still facing the new challenges of the pandemic, in the 2019 presidential election campaign, the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa proposed a 10-year, national transition to organic farming to declare Sri Lanka as the first nation to be known for its organic produce. On April 27, 2021, the country issued an order prohibiting the import of any inorganic pesticides or fertilizers, creating chaos among farmers. While such a change was made over concerns for the nation&#x27;s ecosystems and the health of citizens where pesticide poisonings prevailed over other health related deaths, the precipitous decision was met with criticism from the agriculture industry. This included fears that the mandate would harm the yields of the country&#x27;s major crops (despite claims to the contrary), that the country would not be able to produce enough organic fertilizer domestically, and organic farming being more expensive and complex than conventional agriculture. To put this into perspective, 7.4% of Sri Lanka&#x27;s GDP is reliant on agriculture and 30% of citizens work in this sector. This means that about ⅓ of its population is dependent on this sector for jobs, making its maintenance highly crucial for the prosperity of the nation&#x27;s social and economic status. Of special concern was rice and tea, which are a staple food and major export respectively.

Despite it being a record crop in the first half of 2021, the tea crop began to decline in July of that year. Rice production fell by 20% over the first six months of the ban, and prices increased by around 50%. Contrary to its past success at self-sustainability, the country had to import US$450 million worth of rice to meet domestic demand. In late August, the government acknowledged the ban had created a critical dependency on supplies of imported organic fertilizers, but by then food prices had already increased twofold in some cases. In September 2021, the government declared an economic emergency, citing the ban&#x27;s impact on food prices, as well as inflation from the devaluation of Sri Lankan currency due to the crashing tea industry, and a lack of tourism induced by COVID-19 restrictions.

In November 2021, the country partially lifted the ban on inorganic farming for certain key crops such as rubber and tea, and began to offer compensation and subsidies to farmers and rice producers in an attempt to cover losses. The previous subsidies on synthetic fertilizer imports were not reintroduced.

<text>BBC Radio 4 is a British national radio station owned and operated by the BBC. The station replaced the BBC Home Service on 30 September 1967 and broadcasts a wide variety of spoken-word programmes from the BBC&#x27;s headquarters at Broadcasting House, London. Since 2019, the station controller has been Mohit Bakaya. He replaced Gwyneth Williams, who had been the station controller since 2010.

Broadcasting throughout the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands on FM, LW and DAB, and on BBC Sounds, it can be received in the eastern counties of Ireland, northern France and Northern Europe. It is available on Freeview, Sky, and Virgin Media. Radio 4 currently reaches over 10 million listeners, making it the UK&#x27;s second most-popular radio station after BBC Radio 2.

BBC Radio 4 broadcasts news programmes such as &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;The World at One&quot; and &quot;PM&quot; heralded on air by the Greenwich Time Signal pips or the chimes of Big Ben. The pips are only accurate on FM, and LW; there is a delay on digital radio of three to five seconds and online up to 23 seconds. Radio 4 broadcasts the Shipping Forecast which, in August 2017, was 150 years old.

According to RAJAR, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 9.2 million with a listening share of 11.1% as of December 2023.

==Overview==
BBC Radio 4 is the second-most-popular British domestic radio station by total hours, after Radio 2. It recorded its highest audience, of 11 million listeners, in May 2011, and was &quot;UK Radio Station of the Year&quot; at the 2003, 2004, 2008 and 2023 Radio Academy Awards. It also won a Peabody Award in 2002 for &quot;File on 4: Export Controls&quot;. Costing £71.4 million (2005/6), it is the BBC&#x27;s most expensive national radio network and is considered by many to be its flagship. There is no comparable British commercial network: Channel 4 abandoned plans to launch its own speech-based digital radio station in October 2008 as part of a £100m cost cutting review.

The station is available on FM in most of Great Britain, parts of Ireland and the north of France; LW throughout the UK and in parts of Northern Europe, and the Atlantic north of the Azores to about 20 degrees west; DAB; Digital TV including Freeview, Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media, and on the Internet. Freesat, Sky and Virgin have a separate channel for Radio 4 LW output in mono, in addition to the FM output.

The longwave signal is part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s system of letters of last resort. In the event of a suspected catastrophic attack on Britain, submarine captains, in addition to other checks, check for a broadcast signal from Radio 4 on 198 longwave to verify the annihilation of organised society in Great Britain.

BBC Radio 4 broadcasts a wide variety of speech-related programming, including news, drama, comedy, science and history. Music is broadcast as in documentaries relating to various forms of both popular and classical music, and the long-running music-based &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Sport is also not part of the station&#x27;s output, apart from during news bulletins, although between 1994 and 2023, the station&#x27;s long wave frequency was used to broadcast ball-by-ball commentaries of most Test cricket matches played by England. Consequently, for around 70 days a year, listeners had to rely on FM broadcasts or DAB for mainstream Radio 4 broadcasts – the number relying solely on long wave was now a small minority. The cricket broadcasts took precedence over on-the-hour news bulletins, but not the Shipping Forecast, carried since Radio 4&#x27;s move to long wave in 1978 because long wave can be received clearly at sea.

== History ==

Initially the power was 100 watts on 350 metres (857 kHz). 2LO was allowed to transmit for seven minutes, after which the &quot;operator&quot; had to listen on the wavelength for three minutes for possible instructions to close down. On 14 November 1922 the station was transferred to the new British Broadcasting Company which in 1923 took up the nearby Savoy Hill for its broadcasting studios. At midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1923, the twelve chimes of Big Ben were broadcast for the first time to mark the new year.

In 1927 the company became the British Broadcasting Corporation. On 9 March 1930 2LO was replaced by the BBC Regional Programme and the BBC National Programme. The letters LO continued to be used internally as a designation in the BBC for technical operations in the London area (for example, the numbering of all recordings made in London contained LO). The code LO was changed to LN in the early 1970s.

When the British Broadcasting Company first began transmissions on 14 November 1922 from station 2LO in the Strand, which it had inherited from the Marconi Company (one of six commercial companies which created), but technology did not yet exist either for national coverage or joint programming between transmitters. Whilst it was possible to combine large numbers of trunk telephone lines to link transmitters for individual programmes, the process was expensive and not encouraged by the General Post Office as it tied up large parts of the telephone network. The stations that followed the establishment of 2LO in London were therefore autonomously programmed using local talent and facilities.

By May 1923, simultaneous broadcasting was technically possible at least between main transmitters and relay stations, the quality was not felt to be high enough to provide a national service or regular simultaneous broadcasts. In 1924, it was felt that technical standards had improved enough for London to start to provide the majority of the output, cutting the local stations back to providing items of local interest.

===Main stations===
Each of these main stations were broadcast at approximately 1 kilowatt (kW):
====Relay stations====
Each of these relay stations were broadcast at approximately 120 watts (W):
The BBC Home Service was the predecessor of Radio 4 and broadcast between 1939 and 1967. It had regional variations and was broadcast on medium wave with a network of VHF FM transmitters being added from 1955. Radio 4 replaced it on 30 September 1967, when the BBC restructured and renamed its domestic radio stations, in response to the challenge of offshore radio. It moved to long wave in November 1978, taking over the 200 kHz frequency (1,500 metres) previously held by Radio 2 - later moved to 198 kHz as a result of international agreements aimed at avoiding interference (all ITU Region 1 MW/LW broadcast frequencies are divisible by 9). At this point, Radio 4 became available across all of the UK for the first time and the station officially became known as Radio 4 UK, a title that remained until 29 September 1984.

For a time during the 1970s Radio 4 carried regional news bulletins Monday to Saturday. These were broadcast twice at breakfast, at lunchtime and at 17:55. There were also programme variations for the parts of England not served by BBC Local Radio stations. These included &quot;Roundabout East Anglia&quot;, a VHF opt-out of the &quot;Today&quot; programme broadcast from BBC East&#x27;s studios in Norwich each weekday from 6.45 a.m. to 8.45 a.m. &quot;Roundabout East Anglia&quot; came to an end in August 1980, ahead of the launch of BBC Radio Norfolk.

All regional news bulletins broadcast from BBC regional news bases around England ended in August 1980, apart from in the southwest as until January 1983 there was no BBC Local Radio in the southwest so these news bulletins and its weekday morning regional programme, &quot;Morning Sou&#x27;West&quot;, continued to be broadcast from the BBC studios in Plymouth on VHF and on the Radio 4 medium wave Plymouth relay until 31 December 1982.

The launch of Radio 5 on 27 August 1990 saw the removal of Open University, schools programming, children&#x27;s programmes and the &quot;Study on 4&quot;/&quot;Options&quot; adult education slot from Radio 4&#x27;s FM frequencies. Consequently, the full Radio 4 schedule became available on FM for the first time. However, adult educational and Open University programming returned to Radio 4 in 1994 when Radio 5 was closed to make way for the launch of BBC Radio 5 Live and were broadcast until the end of the 1990s on Sunday evenings on longwave only.

Between 17 January 1991 and 2 March 1991 FM broadcasts were replaced by a continuous news service devoted to the Gulf War, Radio 4 News FM, with the main Radio 4 service transferring to long wave. Before this, Radio 4&#x27;s FM frequencies had occasionally been used for additional news coverage, generally for live coverage of statements and debates in Parliament.

By the start of the 1990s, Radio 4 had become available on FM in most of the UK - previously FM coverage had been restricted mainly to England and south Wales. This meant that it was possible for the main Radio 4 service to be transferred from LW to FM, and this took place on 16 September 1991 with opt-outs - extra shipping forecasts, &quot;Daily Service&quot; and &quot;Yesterday in Parliament&quot;, joined in 1994 by &quot;Test Match Special&quot;. Longwave also occasionally opted out at other times, such as to broadcast special services, the most recent being when Pope Benedict XVI visited Britain in 2010.

On 30 May 2023, the BBC announced that Radio 4 will stop broadcasting opt-outs on long wave with the last opt-outs airing on 31 March 2024. The two displaced programmes, &quot;Daily Service&quot; and &quot;Yesterday in Parliament&quot; moved to BBC Radio 4 Extra. The daily amount of &quot;Shipping Forecasts&quot; was reduced to be broadcast 2 times on weekdays and 3 times on weekends. &quot;Test Match Special&quot; moved to BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra on 31 July 2023. These end ahead of a planned switch-off of long wave transmissions by 2025.

BBC Radio 4&#x27;s medium wave frequencies were switched off on 15 April 2024, which previously served as relays in areas with a weak LW signal to provide reception of BBC Radio 4 LW, such as Northern Ireland and south west England. Most were turned off at 12:27 PM BST and broadcast an endless closedown loop informing listeners to retune to other methods of reception. The final transmitter to change into the closedown loop was the Plymouth relay on 774 kHz at 4:59 PM BST. These relays stopped broadcasting the closedown loop and fell silent completely by 30 April 2024.

== Programmes and schedules ==
=== Daily schedule ===
An online schedule page lists the running order of programmes.

=== Production ===
The station broadcasts a mix of live and pre-recorded programmes. Live programming includes breakfast programme &quot;Today&quot;, magazine programme &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;, consumer affairs programme &quot;You and Yours&quot;, and (often) the music, film, books, arts and culture programme &quot;Front Row&quot;. Continuity is managed from Broadcasting House with news bulletins, including the hourly summaries and longer programmes such as the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and &quot;Midnight News&quot;, and news programmes such as &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;The World at One&quot; and &quot;PM&quot;, which by early 2013 had returned to Broadcasting House after 15 years at BBC Television Centre in White City. The news returning to Broadcasting House has also meant that newsreaders can provide cover for continuity, which regularly occurs at 23:00 each night and 16:00 on a Sunday. This has reduced the total number of continuity announcers required each day down from four to three.

The Greenwich Time Signal, popularly known as &quot;the pips&quot;, is broadcast every hour to herald the news bulletin, except at midnight and 18:00, and 22:00 on Sunday, when the chimes of Big Ben are played. There is no Greenwich Time Signal at 15:00 on Saturday or 11:00 and 12:00 on Sunday due to the Saturday Afternoon drama and the omnibus edition of &quot;The Archers&quot; respectively. Only pips broadcast on FM and LW are accurate. On digital platforms there is a delay of between three and five seconds, and up to 23 seconds online.

=== Programmes ===

Radio 4 programmes cover a wide variety of genre including news and current affairs, history, culture, science, religion, arts, comedy, drama and entertainment. A number of the programmes on Radio 4 take the form of a &quot;magazine&quot; show, featuring numerous small contributions over the course of the programme—&quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;, &quot;From Our Own Correspondent&quot;, &quot;You and Yours&quot;. The rise of these magazine shows is primarily due to the work of Tony Whitby, controller of Radio 4 from 1970 to 1975. The station hosts a number of long-running programmes, many of which have been broadcast for over 40 years.

Most programmes are available for 30 days or over a year after broadcast as streaming audio from Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;listen again&quot; page and via BBC Sounds. A selection of programmes is also available as podcasts or downloadable audio files. Many comedy and drama programmes from the Radio 4 archives are broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra.
Due to the capacity limitations of DAB and increasing sport broadcasts on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Radio 4 DAB has to reduce its bit rate most evenings, such that after 7 p.m. its DAB output is usually in mono, even though many of its programmes are made in stereo (including its flagship drama &quot;The Archers&quot;), these can be heard in stereo only on FM, Digital TV on Freeview &amp; Freesat (Ch. 704), Sky, Virgin and on line via BBC Sounds. BBC World Service, which uses BBC Radio 4 FM &amp; DAB frequencies between 01:00 and 05:20, is in stereo, but only on Radio 4 FM &amp; DAB and not on its own dedicated DAB channel. BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcasts in mono on DAB, but has always been in stereo on Digital TV (Freeview / Freesat Ch 708), Sky, Virgin and online.

== Notable continuity announcers and newsreaders ==
Announcers carry out the following duties from Broadcasting House:
* Provide links (or junctions) between programmes
* Read trails for programmes
* Provide reassurance to listeners during a programme breakdown
* Read the Shipping Forecast (except the 05:20 broadcast, which is covered by BBC Weather)
* Read the BBC Radio 3 news summaries at 13:00 and 18:00 on weekdays

Newsreaders read hourly summaries and longer bulletins from New Broadcasting House. In 2012 the BBC announced that it would be reducing its main presentation team from 12 to ten.

== Criticisms==
Criticism voiced by centre-right newspapers in recent years have a perceived left political bias across a range of issues, as well as sycophancy in interviews, particularly on the popular morning news magazine &quot;Today&quot; as part of a reported perception of a general &quot;malaise&quot; at the BBC. Conversely, the journalist Mehdi Hasan has criticised the station for an overtly &quot;socially and culturally conservative&quot; approach.

There has been criticism of &quot;Today&quot; in particular for a lack of female broadcasters. In September 1972, Radio 4 employed the first female continuity announcers—Hylda Bamber and Barbara Edwards. For quite some time, the introduction of female newsreaders led to complaints from listeners; women discussing topics of feminist interest led to similar complaints. In addition, there has been long-running criticism by atheist and humanist groups of &quot;Thought for the Day&quot;, a slot dedicated exclusively to religious discussion during Radio 4&#x27;s flagship morning news programme.

Radio 4 has been criticised for being &quot;too middle class&quot; and of &quot;little interest&quot; to non-white listeners.

<doc id="72760" wikidata="Q712226" url="?curid=72760" title="Square kilometre">
<text>The square [[kilometre]] (square kilometer in American spelling; symbol: km2) is a multiple of the square metre, the SI unit of area or surface area. In the SI unit of area (m2), 1 km2 is equal to 1M(m2).

1 km2 is equal to:
* 1,000,000 square metres (m2)
* 100 hectares (ha)
It is also approximately equal to:
* 0.3861 square miles 
* 247.1 acres 

Conversely:
*1 m2 = 0.000001 (10−6) km2
*1 hectare = 0.01 (10−2) km2
*1 square mile = 
*1 acre = about 

The symbol &quot;km2&quot; means (km)2, square kilometre or kilometre squared and not k(m2), kilo–square metre. For example, 3 km2 is equal to = 3,000,000 m2, not 3,000 m2.

==Examples of areas of 1 square kilometre==
===Topographical map grids===
Topographical map grids are worked out in metres, with the grid lines being 1,000 metres apart.
* 1:100,000 maps are divided into squares representing 1 km2, each square on the map being one square centimetre in area and representing 1 km2 on the surface of the Earth.
* For 1:50,000 maps, the grid lines are 2 cm apart. Each square on the map is 2 cm by 2 cm (4 cm2) and represents 1 km2 on the surface of the Earth.
* For 1:25,000 maps, the grid lines are 4 cm apart. Each square on the map is 4 cm by 4 cm (16 cm2) and represents 1 km2 on the surface of the Earth.
In each case, the grid lines enclose one square kilometre.

===Medieval city centres===
The area enclosed by the walls of many European medieval cities were about one square kilometre. These walls are often either still standing or the route they followed is still clearly visible, such as in Brussels, where the wall has been replaced by a ring road, or in Frankfurt, where the wall has been replaced by gardens. The approximate area of the old walled cities can often be worked out by fitting the course of the wall to a rectangle or an oval (ellipse). Examples include:
*Delft, Netherlands (See map alongside) 
:The walled city of Delft was approximately rectangular.
::The approximate length of rectangle was about .
::The approximate width of the rectangle was about .
::A perfect rectangle with these measurements has an area of 1.30×0.75 = 0.9 km2

*Lucca (Italy) 
:The medieval city is roughly rectangular with rounded north-east and north-west corners.
::The maximum distance from east to west is .
::The maximum distance from north to south is .
::A perfect rectangle of these dimensions would be 1.36×0.80 = 1.088 km2.

*Bruges (Belgium) 
:The medieval city of Bruges, a major centre in Flanders, was roughly oval or elliptical in shape with the longer or semi-major axis running north and south.
::The maximum distance from north to south (semi-major axis) is .
::The maximum distance from east to west (semi-minor axis) is .
::A perfect ellipse of these dimensions would be 2.53 × 1.81 × (π/4) = 3.597 km2.

*Chester United Kingdom 
:Chester is one of the smaller English cities that has a near-intact city wall.
::The distance from Northgate to Watergate is about 855 metres.
::The distance from Eastgate to Westgate is about 589 metres.
::A perfect rectangle of these dimensions would be (855/1000) × (589/1000) = 0.504 km2.

===Parks===
Parks come in all sizes; a few are almost exactly one square kilometre in area. Here are some examples:
* Riverside Country Park, UK.
* Brierley Forest Park, UK.
* Rio de Los Angeles State Park, California, US 
* Jones County Central Park, Iowa, US.
* Kiest Park, Dallas, Texas, US 
* Hole-in-the-Wall Park &amp; Campground, Grand Manan Island, Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada 
* Downing Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada 
* Citadel Park, Poznan, Poland 
* Sydney Olympic Park, Sydney, Australia, contains 6.63 square kilometres of wetlands and waterways.

===Golf courses===
Using the figures published by golf course architects Crafter and Mogford, a course should have a fairway width of 120 metres and 40 metres clear beyond the hole. Assuming a 18-hole course, an area of 80 hectares (0.8 square kilometre) needs to be allocated for the course itself. Examples of golf courses that are about one square kilometre include:
* Manchester Golf Club, UK 
* Northop Country Park, Wales, UK 
* The Trophy Club, Lebanon, Indiana, US 
* Qingdao International Country Golf Course, Qingdao, Shandong, China
* Arabian Ranches Golf Club, Dubai 
* Sharm el Sheikh Golf Courses: Sharm el Sheikh, South Sinai, Egypt 
* Belmont Golf Club, Lake Macquarie, NSW, Australia 

===Other areas of one square kilometre or thereabouts===
* The Old City of Jerusalem is almost 1 square kilometre in area.
*Milton Science Park, Oxfordshire, UK.
* Mielec Industrial Park, Mielec, Poland 
* The Guildford Campus of Guildford Grammar School, South Guildford, Western Australia
* Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), Surat, India 
* Île aux Cerfs, near the east coast of Mauritius.
*Peng Chau Island, Hong Kong

<text>Franz Scholz (10 December 1909 – 1 September 1998) was a German priest and professor of theology from Breslau, Silesia. He had eight brothers and two sisters. His youngest brother Gerhard is now 86. He studied at Breslau&#x27;s Catholic St.-Matthias-Gymnasium, then Caritas Science at Freiburg. He studied the Polish language at Kraków and Lublin. In 1934 he became a priest and took up a position as chaplain at Cross Church in Breslau. In this office Schulz attended to the spiritual needs of Polish seasonal workers in the Silesian capital city. After receiving his doctorate he transferred to St. Bonifacius Church in Görlitz.

In 1945, the eastern part of the city of Görlitz was split off and became known as Zgorzelec when the Polish-German border was redrawn. Because of his knowledge of Polish, Scholz was able to remain in Zgorzelec, but he chose to leave in 1946 when Germans who remained in the city were forced to adopt Polish citizenship.

Scholz went to the nearby city of Cottbus, but when it became part of the German Democratic Republic in 1949, he moved to West Germany. There, Scholz taught many classes dealing with morals and theology and he received many honors, including Papal Honorary Titles.

Professor Scholz was a theologian with many years of practical experience with parishioners and inmates, and he had experience with Polish life and people. He left a large volume of written material. He was especially opposed to the proposed beatification of the Primate of Poland, August Cardinal Hlond.</text><links>

<doc id="72764" wikidata="Q217605" url="?curid=72764" title="Claw">
<text>A claw is a curved, pointed appendage found at the end of a toe or finger in most amniotes (mammals, reptiles, birds). Some invertebrates such as beetles and spiders have somewhat similar fine, hooked structures at lower elevations that allow the spider cells of their own species the end of the leg or tarsus for gripping a surface as they walk. The pincers of crabs, lobsters and scorpions, more formally known as their chelae, are sometimes called claws.

A true claw is made of a hard protein called keratin. Claws are used to catch and hold prey in carnivorous mammals such as cats and dogs, but may also be used for such purposes as digging, climbing trees, self-defense and grooming, in those and other species.

Similar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called nails instead. Claw-like projections that do not form at the end of digits but spring from other parts of the foot are properly named spurs.

==Tetrapods==
In tetrapods, claws are made of keratin and consist of two layers. The unguis is the harder external layer, which consists of keratin fibers arranged perpendicular to the direction of growth and in layers at an oblique angle. The subunguis is the softer, flaky underside layer whose grain is parallel to the direction of growth. The claw grows outward from the nail matrix at the base of the unguis and the subunguis grows thicker while travelling across the nail bed. The unguis grows outward faster than the subunguis to produce a curve and the thinner sides of the claw wear away faster than their thicker middle, producing a more or less sharp point. Tetrapods use their claws in many ways, commonly to grasp or kill prey, to dig and to climb and hang.

===Mammals===

All carnivorans have claws, which vary considerably in length and shape. Claws grow out of the third phalanges of the paws and are made of keratin. Many predatory mammals have protractile claws that can partially hide inside the animal&#x27;s paw, especially the cat family, Felidae, almost all of whose members have fully protractible claws. Outside of the cat family, retractable claws are found only in certain species of the Viverridae (and the extinct Nimravidae). A claw that is retractable is protected from wear and tear.

Most cats and dogs also have a dewclaw on the inside of the front paws. It is much less functional than the other claws but does help the cats to grasp prey. Because the dew claw does not touch the ground, it receives less wear and tends to be sharper and longer.

A nail is homologous to a claw but is flatter and has a curved edge instead of a point. A nail that is big enough to bear weight is called a &quot;hoof&quot;. (Nevertheless, one side of the cloven-hoof of artiodactyl ungulates may also be called a claw). 

Every so often, the growth of claws stops and restarts, as does hair. In a hair, this results in the hair falling out and being replaced by a new one. In claws, this results in an abscission layer, and the old segment breaks off. This process takes several months for human thumbnails. Cats are often seen working old unguis layers off on wood or on boards made for the purpose. Ungulates&#x27; hooves wear or self-trim by ground contact. Domesticated equids (horses, donkeys and mules) usually need regular trimming by a farrier, as a consequence of reduced activity on hard ground.

====Primates====
Primate nails consist of the unguis alone, as the subunguis has disappeared. With the evolution of grasping hands and feet, claws are no longer necessary for locomotion, and instead most digits exhibit nails. However, claw-like nails are found in small-bodied callitrichids on all digits except the hallux or big toe. A laterally flattened grooming claw, used for grooming, can be found on the second toe in living strepsirrhines, and the second and third in tarsiers. Aye-ayes have functional claws on all other digits except the hallux, including a grooming claw on the second toe. Less commonly known, a grooming claw is also found on the second pedal digit of night monkeys (&quot;Aotus&quot;), titis (&quot;Callicebus&quot;), and possibly other New World monkeys.

===Reptiles===


Most reptiles have well-developed claws. Most lizards have toes ending in stout claws. In snakes, feet and claws are absent, but in many boids such as &quot;Boa constrictor&quot;, remnants of highly reduced hind-limbs emerge with a single claw as &quot;spurs&quot; on each side of the anal opening.

Lizard claws are used as aids in climbing, and in holding down prey in carnivorous species.

===Birds===

A talon is the claw of a bird of prey, its primary hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey would not be able to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for defensive purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit I) for defence and have been known to disembowel people. All birds, however, have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits.

The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digits I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.

===Amphibians===
The only amphibians to bear claws are the African clawed frogs. Claws evolved separately in the amphibian and amniote (reptiliomorph) line. However, the hairy frog has claw analogues on its feet; the frog intentionally dislocates the tips of its fingers to unsheathe the sharp points of its last phalanges.

==Arthropods==


The scientifically correct term for the &quot;claw&quot; of an arthropod, such as a lobster or crab, is a chela (plural &quot;chelae&quot;). Legs bearing a chela are called chelipeds. Chelae are also called pincers.

<text>Christian fundamentalism, also known as fundamental Christianity or fundamentalist Christianity, is a religious movement emphasizing biblical literalism. In its modern form, it began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries among British and American Protestants as a reaction to theological liberalism and cultural modernism. Fundamentalists argued that 19th-century modernist theologians had misunderstood or rejected certain doctrines, especially biblical inerrancy, which they considered the fundamentals of the Christian faith.

Fundamentalists are almost always described as upholding beliefs in biblical infallibility and biblical inerrancy, in keeping with traditional Christian doctrines concerning biblical interpretation, the role of Jesus in the Bible, and the role of the church in society. Fundamentalists usually believe in a core of Christian beliefs, typically called the &quot;Five Fundamentals&quot;. These arose from the Presbyterian Church issuance of &quot;The Doctrinal Deliverance of 1910&quot;. Topics included are statements on the historical accuracy of the Bible and all of the events which are recorded in it as well as the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

Fundamentalism manifests itself in various denominations which believe in various theologies, rather than a single denomination or a systematic theology. The ideology became active in the 1910s after the release of &quot;The Fundamentals&quot;, a twelve-volume set of essays, apologetic and polemic, written by conservative Protestant theologians in an attempt to defend beliefs which they considered Protestant orthodoxy. The movement became more organized within U.S. Protestant churches in the 1920s, especially among Presbyterians, as well as Baptists and Methodists. Many churches which embraced fundamentalism adopted a militant attitude with regard to their core beliefs. Reformed fundamentalists lay heavy emphasis on historic confessions of faith, such as the Westminster Confession of Faith, as well as uphold Princeton theology. Since 1930, many fundamentalist churches in the Baptist tradition (who generally affirm dispensationalism) have been represented by the Independent Fundamental Churches of America (renamed IFCA International in 1996), while many theologically conservative connexions in the Methodist tradition (who adhere to Wesleyan theology) align with the Interchurch Holiness Convention; in various countries, national bodies such as the American Council of Christian Churches exist to encourage dialogue between fundamentalist bodies of different denominational backgrounds. Other fundamentalist denominations have little contact with other bodies.

A few scholars label Catholic activist conservative associations who reject modern Christian theology in favor of more traditional doctrines as fundamentalists. The term is sometimes mistakenly confused with the term &quot;evangelical&quot;.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;fundamentalism&quot; entered the English language in 1922, and it is often capitalized when it is used in reference to the religious movement. By the end of the 20th century, the term &quot;fundamentalism&quot; acquired a pejorative connotation, denoting religious fanaticism or extremism, especially when such labeling extended beyond the original movement which coined the term and those who self-identify as fundamentalists.

Some who hold certain, but not all beliefs in common with the original fundamentalist movement reject the label &quot;fundamentalism&quot;, due to its perceived pejorative nature, while others consider it a banner of pride. In certain parts of the United Kingdom, using the term &quot;fundamentalist&quot; with the intent to stir up religious hatred is a violation of the &quot;Racial and Religious Hatred Act&quot; of 2006.

== History ==
The movement has its origins in 1878 in a meeting of the &quot;Believers&#x27; Meeting for Bible Study&quot; (Niagara Bible Conference) in the United States, where 14 fundamental beliefs were established by evangelical pastors.

Fundamentalism draws from multiple traditions in British and American theologies during the 19th century. According to authors Robert D. Woodberry and Christian S. Smith,
However, the split does not mean that there were just two groups: modernists and fundamentalists. There were also people who considered themselves neo-evangelicals, separating themselves from the extreme components of fundamentalism. These neo-evangelicals also wanted to separate themselves from both the fundamentalist movement and the mainstream evangelical movement due to their anti-intellectual approaches.

From 1910 until 1915, a series of essays titled &quot;The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth&quot; was published by the Testimony Publishing Company of Chicago.

The Northern Presbyterian Church (now Presbyterian Church in the United States of America) influenced the movement with the definition of the five &quot;fundamentals&quot; in 1910, namely
# The inspiration of the Bible by the Holy Spirit and the inerrancy of Scripture as a result of this.
# The virgin birth of Christ.
# The belief that Christ&#x27;s death was an atonement for sin.
# The bodily resurrection of Christ.
# The historical reality of Christ&#x27;s miracles.
The Princeton theology, which responded to higher criticism of the Bible by developing from the 1840s to 1920 the doctrine of inerrancy, was another influence in the movement. This doctrine, also called biblical inerrancy, stated that the Bible was divinely inspired, religiously authoritative, and without error. The Princeton Seminary professor of theology Charles Hodge insisted that the Bible was inerrant because God inspired or &quot;breathed&quot; his exact thoughts into the biblical writers (2 Timothy 3:16). Princeton theologians believed that the Bible should be read differently than any other historical document, and they also believed that Christian modernism and liberalism led people to Hell just like non-Christian religions did.

Biblical inerrancy was a particularly significant rallying point for fundamentalists. This approach to the Bible is associated with conservative evangelical hermeneutical approaches to Scripture, ranging from the historical-grammatical method to biblical literalism.

The Dallas Theological Seminary, founded in 1924 in Dallas, would have a considerable influence in the movement by training students who will establish various independent Bible Colleges and fundamentalist churches in the southern United States.

In the 1930s, fundamentalism was viewed by many as a &quot;last gasp&quot; vestige of something from the past but more recently, scholars have shifted away from that view.

In the early 1940s, evangelicals and fundamentalist Christians began to part ways over whether to separate from modern culture (the fundamentalist approach) or engage with it. An organization very much on the side of separation from modernity was the American Council of Christian Churches, founded in 1941 by Rev. Carl McIntire. Another group &quot;for conservative Christians who wanted to be culturally engaged&quot; was the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) founded in 1942, by Harold Ockenga.

==Changing interpretations==

The interpretations given the fundamentalist movement have changed over time, with most older interpretations being based on the concepts of social displacement or cultural lag. Some in the 1930s, including H. Richard Niebuhr, understood the conflict between fundamentalism and modernism to be part of a broader social conflict between the cities and the country. In this view the fundamentalists were country and small-town dwellers who were reacting against the progressivism of city dwellers. Fundamentalism was seen as a form of anti-intellectualism during the 1950s; in the early 1960s American intellectual and historian Richard Hofstadter interpreted it in terms of status anxiety, social displacement, and &#x27;Manichean mentality&#x27;.

Beginning in the late 1960s, the movement began to be seen as &quot;a bona fide religious, theological and even intellectual movement in its own right&quot;. Instead of interpreting fundamentalism as a simple anti-intellectualism, Paul Carter argued that &quot;fundamentalists were simply intellectual in a way different than their opponents&quot;. Moving into the 1970s, Earnest R. Sandeen saw fundamentalism as arising from the confluence of Princeton theology and millennialism.

George Marsden defined fundamentalism as &quot;militantly anti-modernist Protestant evangelicalism&quot; in his 1980 work &quot;Fundamentalism and American Culture&quot;. &quot;Militant&quot; in this sense does not mean &#x27;violent&#x27;, it means &#x27;aggressively active in a cause&#x27;. Marsden saw fundamentalism arising from a number of preexisting evangelical movements that responded to various perceived threats by joining forces. He argued that Christian fundamentalists were American evangelical Christians who in the 20th century opposed &quot;both modernism in theology and the cultural changes that modernism endorsed. Militant opposition to modernism was what most clearly set off fundamentalism.&quot; Others viewing militancy as a core characteristic of the fundamentalist movement include Philip Melling, Ung Kyu Pak and Ronald Witherup. Donald McKim and David Wright (1992) argue that &quot;in the 1920s, militant conservatives (fundamentalists) united to mount a conservative counter-offensive. Fundamentalists sought to rescue their denominations from the growth of modernism at home.&quot;

According to Marsden, recent scholars differentiate &quot;fundamentalists&quot; from &quot;evangelicals&quot; by arguing the former were more militant and less willing to collaborate with groups considered &quot;modernist&quot; in theology. In the 1940s the more moderate faction of fundamentalists maintained the same theology but began calling themselves &quot;evangelicals&quot; to stress their less militant position. Roger Olson (2007) identifies a more moderate faction of fundamentalists, which he calls &quot;postfundamentalist&quot;, and says &quot;most postfundamentalist evangelicals do not wish to be called fundamentalists, even though their basic theological orientation is not very different&quot;. According to Olson, a key event was the formation of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) in 1942. Barry Hankins (2008) has a similar view, saying &quot;beginning in the 1940s...militant and separatist evangelicals came to be called fundamentalists, while culturally engaged and non-militant evangelicals were supposed to be called evangelicals.&quot;

Timothy Weber views fundamentalism as &quot;a rather distinctive modern reaction to religious, social and intellectual changes of the late 1800s and early 1900s, a reaction that eventually took on a life of its own and changed significantly over time&quot;.

== By region ==
=== In North America ===
Fundamentalist movements existed in most North American Protestant denominations by 1919 following attacks on modernist theology in Presbyterian and Baptist denominations. Fundamentalism was especially controversial among Presbyterians.

==== In Canada ====
In Canada, fundamentalism was less prominent, but an early leader was English-born Thomas Todhunter Shields (1873–1955), who led 80 churches out of the Baptist federation in Ontario in 1927 and formed the Union of Regular Baptist Churches of Ontario and Quebec. He was affiliated with the Baptist Bible Union, based in the United States. His newspaper, &quot;The Gospel Witness,&quot; reached 30,000 subscribers in 16 countries, giving him an international reputation. He was one of the founders of the international Council of Christian Churches.

Oswald J. Smith (1889–1986), reared in rural Ontario and educated at Moody Church in Chicago, set up The Peoples Church in Toronto in 1928. A dynamic preacher and leader in Canadian fundamentalism, Smith wrote 35 books and engaged in missionary work worldwide. Billy Graham called him &quot;the greatest combination pastor, hymn writer, missionary statesman, an evangelist of our time.&quot;

==== In the United States ====

A leading organizer of the fundamentalist campaign against modernism in the United States was William Bell Riley, a Northern Baptist based in Minneapolis, where his Northwestern Bible and Missionary Training School (1902), Northwestern Evangelical Seminary (1935), and Northwestern College (1944) produced thousands of graduates. At a large conference in Philadelphia in 1919, Riley founded the World Christian Fundamentals Association (WCFA), which became the chief interdenominational fundamentalist organization in the 1920s. Some mark this conference as the public start of Christian fundamentalism. Although the fundamentalist drive to take control of the major Protestant denominations failed at the national level during the 1920s, the network of churches and missions fostered by Riley showed that the movement was growing in strength, especially in the U.S. South. Both rural and urban in character, the flourishing movement acted as a denominational surrogate and fostered a militant evangelical Christian orthodoxy. Riley was president of WCFA until 1929, after which the WCFA faded in importance. The Independent Fundamental Churches of America became a leading association of independent U.S. fundamentalist churches upon its founding in 1930. The American Council of Christian Churches was founded for fundamental Christian denominations as an alternative to the National Council of Churches.
Much of the enthusiasm for mobilizing fundamentalism came from Protestant seminaries and Protestant &quot;Bible colleges&quot; in the United States. Two leading fundamentalist seminaries were the dispensationalist Dallas Theological Seminary, founded in 1924 by Lewis Sperry Chafer, and the Reformed Westminster Theological Seminary, formed in 1929 under the leadership and funding of former Princeton Theological Seminary professor J. Gresham Machen. Many Bible colleges were modeled after the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. Dwight Moody was influential in preaching the imminence of the Kingdom of God that was so important to dispensationalism. Bible colleges prepared ministers who lacked college or seminary experience with intense study of the Bible, often using the &quot;Scofield Reference Bible&quot; of 1909, a King James Version of the Bible with detailed notes which interprets passages from a dispensational perspective.

Although U.S. fundamentalism began in the North, the movement&#x27;s largest base of popular support was in the South, especially among Southern Baptists, where individuals (and sometimes entire churches) left the convention and joined other Baptist denominations and movements which they believed were &quot;more conservative&quot; such as the Independent Baptist movement. By the late 1920s the national media had identified it with the South, largely ignoring manifestations elsewhere. In the mid-twentieth century, several Methodists left the mainline Methodist Church and established fundamental Methodist denominations, such as the Evangelical Methodist Church and the Fundamental Methodist Conference (cf. &quot;conservative holiness movement&quot;); others preferred congregating in Independent Methodist churches, many of which are affiliated with the Association of Independent Methodists, which is fundamentalist in its theological orientation. By the 1970s Protestant fundamentalism was deeply entrenched and concentrated in the U.S. South. In 1972–1980 General Social Surveys, 65 percent of respondents from the &quot;East South Central&quot; region (comprising Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Alabama) self-identified as fundamentalist. The share of fundamentalists was at or near 50 percent in &quot;West South Central&quot; (Texas to Arkansas) and &quot;South Atlantic&quot; (Florida to Maryland), and at 25 percent or below elsewhere in the country, with the low of nine percent in New England. The pattern persisted into the 21st century; in 2006–2010 surveys, the average share of fundamentalists in the East South Central Region stood at 58 percent, while, in New England, it climbed slightly to 13 percent.

===== Evolution =====
In the 1920s, Christian fundamentalists &quot;differed on how to understand the account of creation in Genesis&quot; but they &quot;agreed that God was the author of creation and that humans were distinct creatures, separate from animals, and made in the image of God.&quot; While some of them advocated the belief in Old Earth creationism and a few of them even advocated the belief in evolutionary creation, other &quot;strident fundamentalists&quot; advocated Young Earth Creationism and &quot;associated evolution with last-days atheism.&quot; These &quot;strident fundamentalists&quot; in the 1920s devoted themselves to fighting against the teaching of evolution in the nation&#x27;s schools and colleges, especially by passing state laws that affected public schools. William Bell Riley took the initiative in the 1925 Scopes Trial by bringing in famed politician William Jennings Bryan and hiring him to serve as an assistant to the local prosecutor, who helped draw national media attention to the trial. In the half century after the Scopes Trial, fundamentalists had little success in shaping government policy, and they were generally defeated in their efforts to reshape the mainline denominations, which refused to join fundamentalist attacks on evolution. Particularly after the Scopes Trial, liberals saw a division between Christians in favor of the teaching of evolution, whom they viewed as educated and tolerant, and Christians against evolution, whom they viewed as narrow-minded, tribal, and obscurantist.

Edwards (2000), however, challenges the consensus view among scholars that in the wake of the Scopes trial, fundamentalism retreated into the political and cultural background, a viewpoint which is evidenced in the movie &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; and the majority of contemporary historical accounts. Rather, he argues, the cause of fundamentalism&#x27;s retreat was the death of its leader, Bryan. Most fundamentalists saw the trial as a victory rather than a defeat, but Bryan&#x27;s death soon afterward created a leadership void that no other fundamentalist leader could fill. Unlike the other fundamentalist leaders, Bryan brought name recognition, respectability, and the ability to forge a broad-based coalition of fundamentalist religious groups to argue in favor of the anti-evolutionist position.

Gatewood (1969) analyzes the transition from the anti-evolution crusade of the 1920s to the creation science movement of the 1960s. Despite some similarities between these two causes, the creation science movement represented a shift from religious to pseudoscientific objections to Darwin&#x27;s theory. Creation science also differed in terms of popular leadership, rhetorical tone, and sectional focus. It lacked a prestigious leader like Bryan, utilized pseudoscientific argument rather than religious rhetoric, and was a product of California and Michigan rather than the South.

Webb (1991) traces the political and legal struggles between strict creationists and Darwinists to influence the extent to which evolution would be taught as science in Arizona and California schools. After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar anti-evolution laws for their states. These included Reverends R. S. Beal and Aubrey L. Moore in Arizona and members of the Creation Research Society in California, all supported by distinguished laymen. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study, or at least relegate it to the status of unproven theory perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than in other US areas and persisted through the Sputnik era.

In recent times, the courts have heard cases on whether or not the Book of Genesis&#x27;s creation account should be taught in science classrooms alongside evolution, most notably in the 2005 federal court case &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;. Creationism was presented under the banner of intelligent design, with the book &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; being its textbook. The trial ended with the judge deciding that teaching intelligent design in a science class was unconstitutional as it was a religious belief and not science.

The original fundamentalist movement divided along clearly defined lines within conservative evangelical Protestantism as issues progressed. Many groupings, large and small, were produced by this schism. Neo-evangelicalism, the Heritage movement, and Paleo-Orthodoxy have all developed distinct identities, but none of them acknowledge any more than an historical overlap with the fundamentalist movement, and the term is seldom used of them. The broader term &quot;evangelical&quot; includes fundamentalists as well as people with similar or identical religious beliefs who do not engage the outside challenge to the Bible as actively.

Writing in 2023, conservative Christian journalist David French quotes a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention&#x27;s Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission, Richard Land, as identifying fundamentalism as &quot;far more a psychology than a theology,&quot; with characteristics shared by competing Christian theologies and competing religions. According French, that psychology is one that shares &quot;three key traits&quot;: certainty (of a mind unclouded by doubt), ferocity (against perceived enemies of their religion) and solidarity (of &quot;comrades in the foxhole&quot;, a virtue surpassing even piety in importance).

===== Christian right =====
The latter half of the twentieth century witnessed a surge of interest in organized political activism by U.S. fundamentalists. Dispensational fundamentalists viewed the 1948 establishment of the state of Israel as an important sign of the fulfillment of biblical prophecy, and support for Israel became the centerpiece of their approach to U.S. foreign policy. United States Supreme Court decisions also ignited fundamentalists&#x27; interest in organized politics, particularly &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; in 1962, which prohibited state-sanctioned prayer in public schools, and &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot; in 1963, which prohibited mandatory Bible reading in public schools. By the time Ronald Reagan ran for the presidency in 1980, fundamentalist preachers, like the prohibitionist ministers of the early 20th century, were organizing their congregations to vote for supportive candidates.

Leaders of the newly political fundamentalism included Rob Grant and Jerry Falwell. Beginning with Grant&#x27;s American Christian Cause in 1974, Christian Voice throughout the 1970s and Falwell&#x27;s Moral Majority in the 1980s, the Christian Right began to have a major impact on American politics. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Christian Right was influencing elections and policy with groups such as the Family Research Council (founded 1981 by James Dobson) and the Christian Coalition (formed in 1989 by Pat Robertson) helping conservative politicians, especially Republicans, to win state and national elections.

=== In Australia ===
A major organization of fundamentalist, pentecostal churches in Australia is the International Network of Churches, formerly known as the &quot;Christian Outreach Centre&quot;.

A former influential group was the Logos Foundation. The Logos Foundation, led by Howard Carter, was a controversial Christian ministry in the 1970s and 1980s that promoted Reconstructionist, Restorationist, and Dominionist theology. They also actively campaigned for several candidates for Queensland, Australia public office that shared their values (e.g., anti-abortion). The Logos Foundation disbanded shortly after an adulterous affair by Carter became public in 1990.

=== In Russia ===

In Russia, Christian fundamentalism is often based around the Russian Orthodox Church or the Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church. Orthodox Christian fundamentalism was often connected strongly to a sense of Russian nationalism, since the Russian Orthodox Church often has a strong connection to the Russian state. This Church-state connection has arguably existed since the time of Vladimir the Great&#x27;s conversion.

In 2013, composer Andrei Kormukhin and athlete Vladimir Nosov founded the Orthodox fundamentalist and conservative Christian organization known as the Sorok Sorokov Movement. The Sorok Sorokov Movement was founded in reaction to Pussy Riot&#x27;s 2012 protests, which were themselves against increasingly socially conservative policies in Russia, including moves towards decriminalizing wifebeating and criminalizing homosexuality. The Sorok Sorokov Movement has received support from many priests of the Russian Orthodox Church, most notably celebrate priest Vsevolod Chaplin. Chaplin in particular supported the creation of &quot;Orthodox squads&quot; in order to punish people from carrying out &quot;blasphemous acts&quot; in religious places. Some have argues that the Sorok Sorkov Movement has been involved in protecting the construction of Russian Orthodox churches in Moscow, though the facts have been hard to verify with this. Just as many sources have argued that these acts were more in line with violent vigilantism against LGBT people in Russia. The Sorok Sorokov Movement has also been connected to the Russian far-right, including neo-Nazis and Third Positionists. The Sorok Sorokov Movement has its own political party as well, called For the Family.

Many far-right Russian Christian nationalists have been highly supportive of Russia&#x27;s unprovoked war with Ukraine. One such group supportive of Russian Orthodox Christian fundamentalist-nationalism is the Union of Orthodox Banner-Bearers. Known for their book burnings and political rallies, their primary goal is to see a return of the Russian Tsar as supreme autocrat of Russia. The group as a particular affinity for Tsar Nicolas II. The group has at times referred to Russian president Vladimir Putin as a modern Tsar, though it is unclear as to whether or not this is a message of support for Putin or not.

== By denomination ==
=== Independent Baptist Churches ===

Bible Baptist Churches, Fundamental Baptist Churches or Independent Baptist Churches refuse any form of ecclesial authority other than that of the local church. Great emphasis is placed on the literal interpretation of the Bible as the primary method of Bible study as well as the biblical inerrancy and the infallibility of their interpretation. Dispensationalism is common among Independent Baptists. They are opposed to any ecumenical movement with denominations that do not have the same beliefs. Many Independent Fundamentalist Baptist (IFB) churches adhere to only using the King James Version, a position known as King James Onlyism.

=== Methodism ===

Fundamental Methodism includes several connexions, such as the Evangelical Methodist Church and Fundamental Methodist Conference, along with their seminaries such as Breckbill Bible College. Additionally, Methodist connexions in the conservative holiness movement, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Methodist Church Conference, herald the beliefs of &quot;separation from the world, from false doctrines, from other ecclesiastical connections&quot; as well as place heavy emphasis on practicing holiness standards.

=== Nondenominationalism ===
In nondenominational Christianity of the evangelical variety, the word &quot;biblical&quot; or &quot;independent&quot; often appears in the name of the church or denomination. The independence of the church is claimed and affiliation with a Christian denomination is infrequent, although there are fundamentalist denominations.

=== Reformed fundamentalism ===

Reformed fundamentalism includes those denominations in the Reformed tradition (which includes the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Reformed Anglican and Reformed Baptist Churches) who adhere to the doctrine of biblical infallibility and lay heavy emphasis on historic confessions of faith, such as the Westminster Confession.

Examples of Reformed fundamentalist denominations include the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster.

== Criticism ==
Fundamentalists&#x27; literal interpretation of the Bible has been criticized by practitioners of biblical criticism for failing to take into account the circumstances in which the Christian Bible was written. Critics claim that this &quot;literal interpretation&quot; is not in keeping with the message which the scripture intended to convey when it was written, and it also uses the Bible for political purposes by presenting God &quot;more as a God of judgement and punishment than as a God of love and mercy.&quot;

In contrast to the higher criticism, fundamentalism claims to keep the Bible open for the people. However, through the complexity of the dispensational framework, it has actually forced lay readers to remain dependent upon the inductive methods of Bible teachers and ministers.

Christian fundamentalism has been linked to child abuse as well as corporal punishment, with a number of practitioners believing that the Bible tells them to spank their children. Artists have addressed the issues of Christian fundamentalism, with one providing a slogan &quot;America&#x27;s Premier Child Abuse Brand.&quot; 

Researchers find evidence anchoring Christian fundamentalism with beliefs in conspiracy theories such as modern flat Earth beliefs and linking extreme religious fervour with mental illness. Fundamentalists have attempted and continue to attempt to teach intelligent design, a hypothesis with creationism as its base, in lieu of evolution in public schools. This has resulted in legal challenges such as the federal case of &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; which resulted in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania ruling the teaching of intelligent design to be unconstitutional due to its religious roots.

<text>Jacob August Riis ( ; May 3, 1849 – May 26, 1914) was a Danish-American social reformer, &quot;muck-raking&quot; journalist, and social documentary photographer. He contributed significantly to the cause of urban reform in the United States of America at the turn of the twentieth century. He is known for using his photographic and journalistic talents to help the impoverished in New York City; those impoverished New Yorkers were the subject of most of his prolific writings and photography. He endorsed the implementation of &quot;model tenements&quot; in New York with the help of humanitarian Lawrence Veiller. He was an early proponent of the newly practicable casual photography and one of the first to adopt photographic flash.
While living in New York, Riis experienced poverty and became a police reporter writing about the quality of life in the slums. He attempted to alleviate the poor living conditions of poor people by exposing these conditions to the middle and upper classes.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in 1849 in Ribe, Denmark, Jacob Riis was the third of the 15 children (one of whom, an orphaned niece, was fostered) of Niels Edward Riis, a schoolteacher and writer for the local Ribe newspaper, and Carolina Riis (&quot;née&quot; Bendsine Lundholm), a homemaker. Among the 15, only Jacob, one sister, and the foster sister survived into the twentieth century. Riis was influenced by his father, whose school Riis delighted in disrupting. His father persuaded him to read (and improve his English via) Charles Dickens&#x27;s magazine &quot;All the Year Round&quot; and the novels of James Fenimore Cooper.

Jacob had a happy childhood but experienced tragedy at the age of eleven when his brother Theodore, a year younger, drowned. He never forgot his mother&#x27;s grief.

At age eleven or twelve, he donated all the money he had and gave it to a poor Ribe family living in a squalid house if they cleaned it. The tenants took the money and obliged; when he told his mother, she went to help.

Though his father had hoped that Jacob would have a literary career, Jacob wanted to be a carpenter. When he was 16, he became fond of Elisabeth Gjørtz, the 12-year-old adopted daughter of the owner of the company for which he worked as an apprentice carpenter. The father disapproved of the boy&#x27;s blundering attentions, and Riis was forced to travel to Copenhagen to complete his carpentry apprenticeship. Riis returned to Ribe in 1868 at age 19. Discouraged by poor job availability in the region and Gjørtz&#x27;s disfavor of his marriage proposal, Riis decided to emigrate to the United States.

===Migration to the United States===

Riis immigrated to America in 1870, when he was 21 years old, seeking employment as a carpenter. He first traveled in a small boat from Copenhagen to Glasgow, where on May 18 he boarded the steamer &quot;Iowa&quot;, traveling in steerage. He carried $40 donated by friends (he had paid $50 for the passage himself); a gold locket with a strand of Elisabeth&#x27;s hair, presented by her mother; and letters of introduction to the Danish Consul, Mr. Goodall (later president of the American Bank Note Company), a friend of the family since his rescue from a shipwreck at Ribe.
Riis disembarked in New York on June 5, on that day spending half of the $40 his friends had given him on a revolver for defense against human or animal predators.

When Riis arrived in New York City, he was one of a large number of migrants and immigrants, seeking prosperity in a more industrialized environment, who came to urban areas during the years after the American Civil War. Twenty-four million people relocated to urban areas, causing their population to increase eightfold. The demographics of American urban areas became significantly more heterogeneous as many immigrants arrived, creating ethnic enclaves often more populous than many of the cities of their homelands. &quot;In the 1880s 334,000 people were crammed into a single square mile of the Lower East Side, making it the most densely populated place on earth. They were packed into filthy, disease-ridden tenements, 10 or 15 to a room, and the well-off knew nothing about them and cared less.&quot;

After five days, during which he used almost all his money, Riis found work as a carpenter at Brady&#x27;s Bend Iron Works on the Allegheny River above Pittsburgh. After a few days of that, he began mining for increased pay but quickly resumed carpentry. Learning on July 19, 1870, that France had declared war on Germany, he expected that Denmark would join France to avenge the Prussian seizure of Schleswig, and determined to fight for France. He returned to New York, and, having pawned most of his possessions and without money, attempted to enlist at the French consulate, but was told that there was no plan to send a volunteer army from America. Pawning his revolver, he walked out of New York City and collapsed from exhaustion. On waking, he walked to Fordham College where a Catholic priest served him breakfast.

After a brief period of farm working and odd jobs at Mount Vernon, New York, Riis returned to New York City, where he read in The New York &quot;Sun&quot; that the newspaper was recruiting soldiers for the war. Riis rushed there to enlist, but the editor (whom he later realized was Charles Anderson Dana) claimed or affected ignorance but offered the famished Riis a dollar for breakfast; Riis indignantly refused. Riis was destitute, at one time sleeping on a tombstone and surviving on windfall apples. Still, he found work at a brickyard at Little Washington in New Jersey, and was there for six weeks until he heard that a group of volunteers was going to the war. Thereupon he left for New York.

On arrival, Riis found that the rumor was true but that he had arrived too late. He pleaded with the French consul, who expelled him. He made various other attempts to enlist, none successful. As autumn began, Riis was destitute, without a job. He survived on scavenged food and handouts from Delmonico&#x27;s Restaurant, and slept in public areas or in a foul-smelling police lodging-houses. At one point, Riis&#x27;s only companion was a stray dog. One morning he awoke in a police lodging-house to find that his gold locket (with its strand of Elisabeth&#x27;s hair) had been stolen. He complained to the sergeant, who became enraged and expelled him. Riis was devastated. The story became a favorite of Riis&#x27;s. One of his personal victories, he later confessed, was not using his eventual fame to ruin the career of the offending officer. Disgusted, he left New York, buying a passage on a ferry with the silk handkerchief that was his last possession. By doing odd jobs and stowing away on freight trains, Riis eventually reached Philadelphia, where he appealed to the Danish Consul, Ferdinand Myhlertz, for help and was cared for, for two weeks by the Consul and his wife.

Myhlertz sent Riis, now dressed properly in a suit, to the home of an old classmate in Jamestown, New York, in the western part of the state. Riis worked as a carpenter throughout the Scandinavian enclave in surrounding communities, as well as performing a variety of other assorted jobs. He achieved sufficient financial stability to find the time to experiment as a writer, in both Danish and English, although his attempt to get a job at a Buffalo, New York newspaper was unsuccessful, and magazines repeatedly rejected his submissions.

Riis was in much demand as a carpenter, a major reason being the low prices he charged. After a while, Riis returned to New York City. He was most successful as a salesman, particularly of flatirons and fluting irons, becoming promoted to the sales representative of them for the state of Illinois. In Chicago, he was cheated of both his money and his stock and had to return to an earlier base in Pittsburgh where he found that the subordinates he had left to sell in Pennsylvania had cheated him in the same manner. With funds tight, and while bedridden with a fever, Riis learned from a letter that Elisabeth, the former object of his affection, was engaged to a cavalry officer. Once recovered from his illness, Riis returned to New York City, selling flatirons along the way.
In his earlier years Riis had lost six of his brothers who died of tuberculosis, which was occurring in alarming proportions in Europe and the United States. In 1906 Riis received a letter from a family member in Denmark, with a postage stamp and Christmas seal affixed to it, informing him of the great success Christmas seals were experiencing in Denmark in raising funds to fight tuberculosis. Given the plight that befell his brothers, Riis became very interested, especially in the efforts of Einar Holbøll who was responsible for the issuing of Christmas seals, which were being sold at Danish post offices. The sale of Christmas seals had experienced great success in Denmark, and Sweden also. Inspired by the news, Riis was compelled to write an article in a magazine about the dreaded disease and the success of Christmas seals, entitled &quot;Christmas stamps&quot;, urging that such a program be adopted in the United States. Though his idea was supported by a few doctors and hospitals, it was generally shrugged off by the greater population who assumed there was simply no way to deal with the disease. When Emily Bissell, secretary of the Delaware Red Cross, read Riis&#x27; article she thought the idea had great promise. After overcoming initial skepticism she persuaded a printer to produce 50,000 Christmas seals on credit. After getting permission from the Delaware Postmaster, they were sold in various post offices in Delaware. The idea quickly took hold. Through the efforts of Jacob Riis and Emily Bissell, along with the Red Cross, the first Christmas seals saw great success in raising funds in the United States in 1907 and thereafter.

===Early journalism===
Riis noticed an advertisement by a Long Island newspaper looking for an editor, he applied and was appointed city editor. He quickly realized why the job had been available: the editor-in-chief was dishonest and indebted. Riis left within two weeks.

Once again unemployed, Riis returned to the Five Points neighborhood. He was sitting outside the Cooper Union one day when the principal of the school where he had earlier learned telegraphy happened to notice him. He said that if Riis had nothing better to do, then the New York News Association was looking for a trainee. After one more night and a hurried wash in a horse trough, Riis went for an interview. Despite his disheveled appearance, he was sent for a test assignment to observe and write about a luncheon at the Astor House. Riis covered the event competently and got the job.

Riis was able to write about both the rich and impoverished immigrant communities. He did his job well and was promoted to editor of a weekly newspaper, the &quot;News.&quot; However, this newspaper, the periodical of a political group, soon became bankrupt. Simultaneously, Riis got a letter from home which related that both his older brothers, an aunt, and Elisabeth Gjørtz&#x27;s fiancé had died. Riis wrote to Elisabeth to propose, and with $75 of his savings and promissory notes, he bought the &quot;News&quot; company.

Riis worked hard at his newspaper and soon paid his debts. Newly independent, he was able to target the politicians who had previously been his employers. Meanwhile, he received a provisional acceptance from Elisabeth, who asked him to come to Denmark for her, saying &quot;We will strive together for all that is noble and good&quot;. Conveniently, the politicians offered to buy back the newspaper for five times the price Riis had paid; he was thus able to arrive in Denmark with a substantial amount of money.

After some months in Denmark, the newly married couple arrived in New York. Riis worked briefly as editor of a south Brooklyn newspaper, the &quot;Brooklyn News.&quot; To supplement his income, he used a &quot;magic lantern&quot; projector to advertise in Brooklyn, projecting either onto a sheet hung between two trees or onto a screen behind a window. The novelty was a success, and Riis and a friend relocated to upstate New York and Pennsylvania as itinerant advertisers. However, this enterprise ended when the pair became involved in an armed dispute between striking railroad workers and the police, after which Riis quickly returned to New York City.

===Years at the &quot;Tribune&quot;===
A neighbor of Riis, who was the city editor of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, recommended Riis for a short-term contract. Riis did well and was offered the job of a police reporter. He was based in a press office across from police headquarters on Mulberry Street. &quot;Nicknamed &#x27;Death&#x27;s Thoroughfare, Riis&#x27;s biographer Alexander Alland writes, &quot;It was here, where the street crooks its elbow at the Five Points, that the streets and numerous alleys radiated in all directions, forming the foul core of the New York slums.&quot;

During these stints as a police reporter, Riis worked the most crime-ridden and impoverished slums of the city. Through his own experiences in the poorhouses, and witnessing the conditions of the poor in the city slums, he decided to make a difference for them. Working night-shift duty in the immigrant communities of Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, Riis developed a tersely melodramatic writing style and he became one of the earliest reformist journalists.

===Photography===

Riis had been wondering how to show the squalor of which he wrote more vividly than his words could express. He tried sketching but was incompetent at this. Camera lenses of the 1880s were slow, as was the emulsion of photographic plates; photography thus did not seem to be of any use for reporting about conditions of life in dark interiors. In early 1887, however, Riis was startled to read that &quot;a way had been discovered to take pictures by flashlight. The darkest corner might be photographed that way.&quot; The German innovation, by Adolf Miethe and Johannes Gaedicke, flash powder was a mixture of magnesium with potassium chlorate and some antimony sulfide for added stability; the powder was used in a pistol-like device that fired cartridges. This was the introduction of flash photography.

Recognizing the potential of the flash, Riis informed a friend, John Nagle, chief of the Bureau of Vital Statistics in the City Health Department who was also a keen amateur photographer. Nagle found two more photographer friends, Henry Piffard and Richard Hoe Lawrence, and the four of them began to photograph the slums. Their first report was published in the New York newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; on February 12, 1888; it was an unsigned article by Riis which described its author as &quot;an energetic gentleman, who combines in his person, though not in practice, the two dignities of deacon in a Long Island church and a police reporter in New York&quot;. The &quot;pictures of Gotham&#x27;s crime and misery by night and day&quot; are described as &quot;a foundation for a lecture called &#x27;The Other Half: How It Lives and Dies in New York.&#x27; to give at church and Sunday school exhibitions, and the like.&quot; The article was illustrated by twelve line drawings based on the photographs.

Riis and his photographers were among the first Americans to use flash photography. Pistol lamps were dangerous and looked threatening, and would soon be replaced by another method for which Riis lit magnesium powder on a frying pan. The process involved removing the lens cap, igniting the flash powder and replacing the lens cap; the time taken to ignite the flash powder sometimes allowed a visible image blurring created by the flash.

Riis&#x27;s first team soon grew tired of the late hours, and Riis had to find other help. Both his assistants were lazy and one was dishonest, selling plates for which Riis had paid. Riis sued him in court successfully. Nagle suggested that Riis should become self-sufficient, so in January 1888, Riis paid $25 for a 4×5 box camera, plate holders, a tripod and equipment for developing and printing. He took the equipment to the potter&#x27;s field cemetery on Hart Island to practice, making two exposures. The result was seriously overexposed but successful.

For three years, Riis combined his own photographs with others commissioned of professionals, donations by amateurs and purchased lantern slides, all of which formed the basis for his photographic archive.

Because of the nighttime work, he was able to photograph the worst elements of the New York slums, the dark streets, tenement apartments, and &quot;stale-beer&quot; dives, and documented the hardships faced by the poor and criminals, especially in the vicinity of notorious Mulberry Street.

His photojournalism of Mulberry Street caused New York officials to transform the slum&#x27;s &quot;foul core&quot; of Mulberry Bend into Mulberry Park in 1897. The park, today known as Columbus Park, significantly improved conditions in the neighborhood. Riis also praised the park&#x27;s creation, expressing that the youth now had a place to &quot;romp in&quot; and play, rather than &quot;smashing lamps and windows and getting themselves arrested.&quot;

===Public speaking===
Riis accumulated a supply of photography and attempted to submit illustrated essays to magazines. But when an editor at &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly&quot; Magazine said that he liked the photographs but not the writing, and would find another writer, Riis was despondent about magazine publication and instead thought of speaking directly to the public.

This was not easy. The obvious venue would be a church, but several churches—including Riis&#x27;s own—demurred, fearing either that the talks would offend the churchgoers&#x27; sensibilities or that they would offend rich and powerful landlords. However, Adolph Schauffler (of the City Mission Society) and Josiah Strong arranged to sponsor Riis&#x27;s lecture at the Broadway Tabernacle church. Lacking money, Riis partnered with W. L. Craig, a Health Department clerk.

Riis and Craig&#x27;s lectures, illustrated with lantern slides, made little money for the pair, but they both greatly increased the number of people exposed to what Riis had to say and also enabled him to meet people who had the power to effect change, notably Charles Henry Parkhurst and an editor of &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, who invited him to submit an illustrated article.
===Books===
An eighteen-page article by Riis, &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;, appeared in the Christmas 1889 edition of &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. It included nineteen of his photographs rendered as line drawings. Its publication brought an invitation to expand the material into an entire book. Riis, who favored Henry George&#x27;s &#x27;single tax&#x27; system and absorbed George&#x27;s theories and analysis, used that opportunity to attack landlords &quot;with Georgian fervor&quot;.

Riis had already been thinking of writing a book and began writing it during nights. (Days were for reporting for the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, evenings for public speaking.) &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;, subtitled &quot;Studies Among the Tenements of New York&quot;, was published in 1890. The book reused the eighteen line drawings that had appeared in the &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; article and also seventeen reproductions using the halftone method, and thus &quot;[representing] the first extensive use of halftone photographic reproductions in a book&quot;. (The magazine &quot;Sun and Shade&quot; had done the same for a year or so beginning 1888.)

&quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot; sold well and was much quoted. Reviews were generally good, although some reviewers criticized it for oversimplifying and exaggerating. Riis attributed the success to a popular interest in social amelioration stimulated by William Booth&#x27;s &quot;In Darkest England and the Way Out&quot;, and also to Ward McAllister&#x27;s &quot;Society as I Have Found It&quot;, a portrait of the moneyed class. The book encouraged imitations such as &quot;Darkness and Daylight; or, Lights and Shadows of New York Life&quot; (1892), which somehow appropriated Riis&#x27;s own photographs.

&quot;Children of the Poor&quot; (1892) was a sequel in which Riis wrote of particular children that he had encountered.

&quot;The Making of an American&quot; (1901), an autobiography, follows Riis&#x27;s early life in Denmark and his struggles as an immigrant in the United States. The book also describes how Riis became a reporter and how his work in immigrant enclaves kindled his desire for social reforms. Riis organized his autobiography chronologically, but each chapter illustrates a broader theme that America is a land of opportunity for those who are bold enough to take chances on their future. The autobiography is mostly straightforward, but Riis is not sure if his past should be told as a &quot;love story&quot;, &quot;if I am, to tell the truth ... I don&#x27;t see how it can be helped.&quot; Although much of it is biographical, Riis also lays out his opinions about how immigrants like himself can succeed in the United States. Chapter 7 is distinct because Riis&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth, describes her life in Denmark before she married Riis.

Whereas &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;, and some of Riis&#x27;s other books received praise from critics, he received a mixed reception for his autobiography. A &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer dismissed it as a vanity project written for &quot;close and intimate friends&quot;. He admired Riis&#x27;s &quot;dogged pluck&quot; and &quot;indomitable optimism&quot;, but dismissed an &quot;almost colossal egotism—made up of equal parts of vanity and conceit&quot; as a major characteristic of the author. The reviewer anticipated the book would be &quot;eagerly read by that large majority who have a craving and perennial interest in the personal and emotional incidents&quot; within Riis&#x27;s life. Riis anticipated such a critique, &quot;I have never been able to satisfactorily explain the great run &#x27;How The Other Half Lives&#x27; had ... like Topsy, it grew.&quot; Other newspapers, such as the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, published kinder reviews. Two years later, another reviewer reported that Riis&#x27;s story was widely reprinted and dubbed him as one of the &quot;best-known authors and ... one of the most popular lecturers in the United States.&quot;

The value of Riis&#x27;s autobiography lies in the description of his origins as a social reformer. His early experiences in Ribe gave Riis a yardstick with which to measure tenement dwellers&#x27; quality of life. The account of the development of his powers of observation through his experiences as a poor immigrant lent authenticity to his news articles and larger works. Its themes of self-sufficiency, perseverance, and material success are prime examples of an archetype that successful Europeans like Riis used to demonstrate the exceptional opportunities that seem to exist only in the United States. In spite of its triumphalist outlook, &quot;The Making of an American&quot; remains useful as a source for students of immigration history and sociology who want to learn more about the author of &quot;How The Other Half Lives&quot; and the social reform movement that he helped to define.

===Theodore Roosevelt===
Jacob Riis had both a close friendship and on-going, professional relationship with political figure Theodore Roosevelt. Their relationship began in 1895 when Roosevelt was appointed as president of the Board of Commissioners of the New York City Police Department. He asked Riis to show him nighttime police work. During their first tour, the pair found that nine out of ten patrolmen were missing. Riis wrote about this for the next day&#x27;s newspaper, and for the rest of Roosevelt&#x27;s term the force was more attentive. Riis then continued to serve as an advisor to Roosevelt both on the local and eventually federal level.

Roosevelt was greatly inspired by Riis&#x27; work. He personally ensured the closure of the police-managed lodging rooms in which Riis had suffered during his first years in New York. After reading the exposés, Roosevelt was so deeply affected by Riis&#x27;s sense of justice that he befriended Riis for life, later remarking, &quot;Jacob Riis, whom I am tempted to call the best American I ever knew, although he was already a young man when he came hither from Denmark&quot;.

After Roosevelt became president, he wrote a tribute to Riis in the March 1901 edition of &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; Magazine. He wrote:

Roosevelt&#x27;s three-page tribute honored Jacob Riis for his gift of expression and his ability to make others see what he saw and feel what he felt. Roosevelt viewed Riis as a powerful promoter of change who allowed no failure to stop him from seeking reform. As long as Riis continued pursuing useful work, Roosevelt believed he would have no trouble receiving more than enough support.

Roosevelt believed society would benefit from more active reformers such as Riis. In fact, it was in part due to Riis&#x27; influence that Roosevelt instituted the White House Conference on Children as a means to aid the children exposed in &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot; and &quot;Children of the Tenements&quot;.

For his part, Riis wrote a campaign biography of Roosevelt that praised him.

===Public works===
A particularly important effort by Riis was his exposure of the condition of New York&#x27;s water supply. His five-column story &quot;Some Things We Drink&quot;, in the August 21, 1891, edition of the New York &quot;Evening Sun&quot;, included six photographs (later lost). Riis wrote:

The story resulted in the purchase by New York City of areas around the New Croton Reservoir, and may well have saved New Yorkers from an epidemic of cholera.

Riis tried hard to have the slums around Five Points demolished and replaced with a park. His writings resulted in the Drexel Committee investigation of unsafe tenements; this resulted in the Small Park Act of 1887. Riis was not invited to the eventual opening of the park on June 15, 1897, but went all the same, together with Lincoln Steffens. In the last speech, the street cleaning commissioner credited Riis for the park and led the public in giving him three cheers of &quot;Hooray, Jacob Riis!&quot; Other parks also were created, and Riis was popularly credited with them as well.

===Later life===
Riis wrote his autobiography, &quot;The Making of an American&quot;, in 1901. His daughter, Clara C. Riis, married William Clarence Fiske. His son, John Riis (1882–1946), served in Gifford Pinchot&#x27;s new United States Forest Service from 1907 to 1913 as a ranger and forest supervisor on national forests in Utah, California and Oregon. He chronicled his time in the Forest Service in his 1937 book, &quot;Ranger Trails&quot;. Another son, Edward V. Riis, was appointed US Director of Public Information in Copenhagen toward the end of World War I; he spoke against antisemitism. A third son, Roger Williams Riis (1894–1953), was also a reporter and activist. In 1905, Jacob Riis&#x27;s wife Elisabeth became ill and died. Riis remarried in 1907, and with his new wife, Mary Phillips, relocated to a farm in Barre, Massachusetts. Riis died at the farm on May 26, 1914. His second wife lived until 1967, continuing work on the farm, working on Wall Street and teaching classes at Columbia University.
Riis&#x27;s grave is marked by an unmarked granite boulder in Riverside Cemetery, in Barre, Massachusetts.

==Social attitudes==

Riis&#x27;s concern for the poor and destitute often caused people to assume he disliked the rich. However, Riis showed no sign of discomfort among the affluent, often asking them for their support. Although seldom involved with party politics, Riis was sufficiently disgusted by the corruption of Tammany Hall to change from being an endorser of the Democratic Party to endorse the Republican Party. The period just before the Spanish–American War was difficult for Riis. He was approached by liberals who suspected that protests of alleged Spanish mistreatment of the Cubans was merely a ruse intended to provide a pretext for US expansionism; perhaps to avoid offending his friend Roosevelt, Riis refused the offer of good payment to investigate this and made nationalist statements.

==Criticism==
While the impact of Riis&#x27;s work on social reform is undeniable, Riis&#x27;s own biases especially against Jewish immigrants is also present in his work. His audience comprised middle-class reformers, and critics say that he had no love for the traditional lifestyles of the people he portrayed. Stange (1989) argues that Riis &quot;recoiled from workers and working-class culture&quot; and appealed primarily to the anxieties and fears of his middle-class audience. Riis portrayed a widespread fear among Anglo-Saxons that America was quickly changing as a result of the influx of immigrants, and that “American family values” were fading. Riis has also been criticized for allowing his Christian beliefs to affect his work. Riis&#x27;s work often utilized elements of the social gospel, which at the time didn&#x27;t draw criticism, but current critics note that this framework led to some of his biases against immigrant populations. Swienty (2008) says, &quot;Riis was quite impatient with most of his fellow immigrants; he was quick to judge and condemn those who failed to assimilate, and he did not refrain from expressing his contempt.&quot; Riis&#x27;s photography is also criticized for representing immigrant groups as monochromatic.

Some critics have questioned his right to interfere with the lives and choices of others. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell (2001) argues that immigrants during Riis&#x27;s time were typically willing to live in cramped, unpleasant circumstances as a deliberate short-term strategy that allowed them to save more than half their earnings to help family members come to America, with every intention of relocating to more comfortable lodgings eventually. Many tenement renters physically resisted the well-intentioned relocation efforts of reformers like Riis, states Sowell, because other lodgings were too costly to allow for the high rate of savings possible in the tenements. There were other reform attempts to relocate immigrants further outside the city, such as Williamsburg or Brownsville, however these also failed as living conditions weren&#x27;t much better and those living there still had to travel into the city for work. Moreover, according to Sowell, Riis&#x27;s own personal experiences were the rule rather than the exception during his era: like most immigrants and low-income persons, he lived in the tenements only temporarily before gradually earning more income and relocating to different lodgings.

The harshest criticisms that Riis faced was for his depictions of Eastern European Jews. Gurock (1981) says Riis was insensitive to the needs and fears of East European Jewish immigrants who flooded into New York at this time. Fried (1997), a critic of Riis, argues that the undertone to many of Riis&#x27; work was “the image of Jews as alien, exotic, unassimilable race, and a people resistant to the promises of Christian universalism.&quot; Riis&#x27; written work about the Jews invoked anti-semitic tropes such as saying “money is their god” Additionally, Riis saw the Jews as antiquated and mysterious. He called the area of the Lower East Side with the most Jewish immigrants, Jewtown, with a “omnipresent and unfathomable peddler” harking back to the trope of the Jewish usurer, and that entering a Jewish house of mourning meant “going back 2000 years”. Fried notes that as Riis gained popularity he moderated his comments about Jews however critics still point to his earlier works as influencing his biases later on in life.

The Jews weren&#x27;t the only immigrant group he stereotyped in his work in an effort to explain why these groups “hindered the growth of a uniform culture”. In Riis&#x27;s books, according to some historians, &quot;The Jews are nervous and inquisitive, the Orientals are sinister, the Italians are unsanitary.&quot; For example, early on in his career he stated that “the Chinese must go” and then 20 years later “only as regards to the Asiatic we have made a flat verdict of exclusion” Riis also criticized Italian immigrants stating that they “reproduce conditions of destitution and disorder”.

<text>Gyro Gearloose ( ) is a cartoon character created in 1952 by Carl Barks for Disney comics. An anthropomorphic chicken, he is part of the Donald Duck universe, appearing in comic book stories as a friend of Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck, and anyone who is associated with them. He was also featured in the animated series &quot;DuckTales&quot;. Gyro first appeared in the Carl Barks comic &quot;Gladstone&#x27;s Terrible Secret&quot; (&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #140, May 1952), and was the regular lead character in 4-page backup stories in Barks&#x27; issues of &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;, starting with issue #13 (March 1956) and continuing through #41 (March 1963).

==Biography==
Gyro is Duckburg&#x27;s ingenious inventor, even though his inventions sometimes do not work the way he wants them to. His outrageous productivity is presented as a factor in the quality of his inventions. Because Gyro is always coming up with new ideas, the fact that his inventions often lack an important feature will often cause trouble for both Scrooge and Donald, who are known to have frequently bought his inventions. He is known for being good-natured towards others. Gyro is often assisted by his Little Helper (or just &quot;Helper&quot;), who is a small anthropomorphic robot with a light bulb for a head. Besides Little Helper, he also has a &quot;thinking cap&quot;, a hat shaped like a combination of a rooftop and a nest, with three black birds living inside it. Wearing this thinking cap helps Gyro figure out particularly difficult problems, but it only works if the birds are currently nesting in the cap. Some stories have involved the birds leaving Gyro&#x27;s thinking cap, resulting in the cap becoming ineffective.

Some of Gyro&#x27;s relatives include his father Fulton Gearloose, his grandfather Ratchet Gearloose, and Newton Gearloose, his nephew. Occasionally there have been stories about Gyro&#x27;s girlfriend Matilda. In some stories, Gyro&#x27;s primary rival is Emil Eagle, although he is also antagonized by the Beagle Boys and Magica De Spell. With his inventions, he is also a very important ally of Donald Duck&#x27;s alter ego, Paperinik, in the Italian Disney comics. Consistent with the two &quot;G&#x27;s&quot; in his name, he had bins on his shelves containing odds and ends, which he labeled &quot;Gewgaws&quot;, &quot;Gimcracks&quot;, &quot;Gadgets&quot;, and &quot;Gizmos&quot;.

==Appearances in other media==
Gyro made his first animated appearance in a 1980s full-length movie, the &quot;Sport Goofy in Soccermania&quot; television special, with only one line of dialogue, voiced by Will Ryan: &quot;Scrooge parting with a million dollars?&quot; In the subsequent 1987 animated series &quot;DuckTales&quot;, Gyro became a regular character, with Hal Smith supplying his voice while Barry Gordon records it in several episodes. Among Gyro&#x27;s noteworthy inventions in the series was the creation of the GizmoDuck suit, intended to be worn by a security guard for Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s Money Bin. Although Gyro&#x27;s shop and house are on the south side of Duckburg, he was born on the north side; a sign marks his birthplace and mentions one of his inventions: topless hats.

In high school, young Gyro was a baseball pitcher with his &quot;madball&quot; pitch — actually only a straight-ball pitch. When Gyro is forced to pitch for the Northside, pitting an &quot;unhittable&quot; baseball against another of his inventions, an &quot;unmissable&quot; baseball bat made for the Southside team, the result is total chaos.

Gyro is a classic example of an eccentric genius. Once he persuaded the citizens of Duckburg to rebuild their metropolis into a climate-controlled &quot;City of the Future&quot;. Unfortunately for Gyro, his idea worked too well. Donald Duck worked only 1 hour a day and spent 23 hours sleeping, which left him more grouchy than normal, while Uncle Scrooge&#x27;s robot made him so much money that it filled up his money bin to the point where he could not even burrow into it. The final straw came when Gyro&#x27;s Robot Helper makes a robot to replace Gyro as an inventor. Realizing Duckburg is not ready for the future, Gyro returns the city back to its old self.

Contrary to his entry in Don Markstein&#x27;s Toonopedia, Gyro never appeared on &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. Gyro, in his usual role as an inventor, is replaced with Ludwig Von Drake in &quot;House of Mouse&quot; and many other cartoons.

In the Toontown universe, Gyro created a robot that, when Scrooge accidentally wired it incorrectly, made the Cogs, the main antagonists of the game. They were grim businessmen-like robots who could not take a joke. So, to take care of the infestation, the Toons (the main protagonists of the game) destroyed them with gags such as squirting seltzer water and throwing pies at them.

A reimagined Gyro appears in the 2017 reboot of &quot;DuckTales&quot; (voiced by Jim Rash), in which he maintains a lab below Scrooge&#x27;s Money Bin. This Gyro merges characteristics of his harsher, early comic book self with those of his original &quot;DuckTales&quot; counterpart along with adlibbing by Rash; the result being an eccentric who struggles with social graces and has a short temper, yet still retains a good nature and makes efforts to stop his inventions from harming people. He also has a track record of inventions gaining sentience and becoming evil, though he argues that some of them are merely misunderstood (a trait that the show creators have also attributed to Gyro himself). In his debut episode, &quot;The Great Dime Chase!&quot;, he unveils Little Bulb (this show&#x27;s version of Little Helper), who goes out of control under Louie&#x27;s supervision (though Gyro manages to fix the problem by replacing his invention&#x27;s head with a lower-watt bulb). He later begins brainstorming the creation of the Gizmoduck suit under the codename &quot;Project Blatherskite&quot;. In season one&#x27;s subsequent episodes, he took on Fenton Crackshell-Cabrera as an intern, clashed with Scrooge&#x27;s rival Mark Beaks, and forced Donald Duck to swallow a voice modulator. In the season 2 premiere, he uses a modified shrink ray invention to communicate with a microscopic civilizations in the McDuck household, only to be taken hostage when he attempted to become their god-king. Later in season 2, his oxy-chew gum (used by Della and Donald Duck to survive on the moon), Time Teaser (used by Flintheart Glomgold in a scheme against Scrooge McDuck), and Time Tub (used by Gyro himself to travel back to the Old West and by Louie as part of a get-rich-quick scheme) make appearances. In the season 2 finale, he developed a clone spray that he used on himself and produced a small army of Little Bulbs with walkie-talkie functions. In season three, Gyro&#x27;s past is explored further. Decades prior to the series, he worked as an optimistic young intern under roboticist, Dr. Akita. Gyro built a child-like defense drone named 2-BO and treated him like a real boy, but Akita tampered with his programming before using him to terrorize the city of Tokyolk. Having lost his creation, Gyro became embittered and repressed his memories of the android. When Huey brought 2-BO, now B.O.Y.D., to him to be fixed, Gyro was forced to return to Tokyolk and confront his past as well as Akita. Once he learned what happened and defeated his former mentor, Gyro reconciled with B.O.Y.D.

==Gearloose family members==

===Ratchet Gearloose===
Ratchet Gearloose is Gyro&#x27;s paternal grandfather, created by Carl Barks. He knew Scrooge McDuck: he first met him during his Mississippi riverboat days. They later met on the island of Krakatoa. Nothing was known about Ratchet since then but it is assumed that he wound up in Duckburg since his son Fulton Gearloose is one of the first three Junior Woodchucks.

===Fulton Gearloose===
Fulton Gearloose is the son of Ratchet Gearloose and the father of Gyro Gearloose. Created by Don Rosa, he was first mentioned in &quot;Guardians of The Library&quot; in &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures #27&quot; as the inventor of The Junior Woodchucks Merit Badge, as well as the first person it was awarded to (for inventing it). He first appeared in person in &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Part 10&quot; as a young child and one of the first three Junior Woodchucks. He appears as an elderly man in the story &quot;Gyro&#x27;s First Invention&quot;.

===Newton Gearloose===
Newton Gearloose is Gyro&#x27;s nephew. He first appeared in 1960 in the Gyro Gearloose story titled &#x27;Ting-A-Ling Trouble&#x27;, written by Vic Lockman and drawn by Phil DeLara, in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #308. Newton was a fan of his uncle&#x27;s work and wanted to be an inventor like him when he grew up. Newton is also a Junior Woodchuck, as well as a friend of Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Newton went by the nickname &quot;Giggy&quot;. After the early 1970s, Newton ceased appearing in new North American Disney comics. He continued to be used in some Brazilian and Danish-produced Disney comics into the 1990s, while he still appears in Dutch and Italian-produced comics. There was a similar character in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode &quot;Superdoo&quot;. Like Newton, he was also in the Junior Woodchucks. Though his name is never spoken, he does bear a physical resemblance to Newton Gearloose.

===Other relatives===
Italian Disney comics, which have not been translated into English, and the Gearloose family tree drawn by Marco Gervasio, have introduced other members of Gyro&#x27;s family, such as his mother Sonia, his grandmother Martha Bird, his great-grandfather Copernico and great-great-uncle Cartesio.

<text>Magica De Spell ( being ) is a cartoon character created in 1961 by Carl Barks for the Duck universe. An Italian sorceress, she constantly attempts to steal Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s Number One Dime, which she believes will play a vital role in magically obtaining the same fabulous wealth of its owner.

==Appearance==
Magica is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. She has black hair, purple eye shadow and typically wears a black dress. In the 2017 reboot of DuckTales, her feathers are green instead of white and she wears a cape with a hood. After she has lost her magical powers at the end of the first season, her feathers became white as can be seen at the end of the finale. She manages to get her magic back in the Season 3 episode, &quot;The Phantom and the Sorceress!&quot;.

==Publication history==
De Spell first appeared in &quot;The Midas Touch&quot;, first published in &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #36 (December 1961). According to Barks, he intended to create her as another recurring antagonist for Scrooge in addition to the Beagle Boys and Flintheart Glomgold. In contrast to Witch Hazel from &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; — first released on October 10, 1952 — or Mad Madam Mim, she would not be in the image of the ugly old hag usually associated with witches. Barks instead decided to create a witch who was young and beautiful, so he took inspiration for her look from Italian actresses Gina Lollobrigida and Sophia Loren. He also wanted her to be seductive, amoral, and somewhat threatening. In a later interview, Barks identified a similar figure from the comic strips of Charles Addams as another source of inspiration for Magica, namely Morticia Addams of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;.

All in all, Barks drew nine stories with Magica: &quot;The Midas Touch&quot; in 1961; &quot;Ten-Cent Valentine&quot;, &quot;The Unsafe Safe&quot;, and &quot;Raven Mad&quot; in 1962; &quot;Oddball Odyssey&quot;, &quot;For Old Dime&#x27;s Sake&quot;, and &quot;Isle of Golden Geese&quot; in 1963; &quot;The Many Faces of Magica de Spell,&quot; and lastly &quot;Rug Riders in the Sky&quot; in 1964. In the latter, Barks tried to increase the usability of the character by having plots turn on other magic artifacts – here, a flying carpet – not always having to repeat the joke about Scrooge&#x27;s first coin. Magica also appeared as an antagonist in the &quot;Wizards of Mickey&quot; comic series as part of a trio of sorceresses who all had rivalries with each other.

==Character biography==
According to Barks and his successors, Magica lives on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, next to Naples, Italy. Her primary motivation is to steal Scrooge&#x27;s Number One Dime and melt it in the fires of the volcano, so she can turn it into a powerful magical amulet capable of granting the Midas Touch.

While she has worked with criminals – the Beagle Boys, for example – to get Scrooge&#x27;s Dime, Magica typically works with individuals such as a raven named Ratface in the comics and apprentices like Samson Hex, a bungling no-hoper. Magica&#x27;s family members have also appeared in the comics; her grandmother Granny De Spell, who has been no more successful in obtaining the Number One Dime despite claiming to be one of the most powerful witches; her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West; the Wicked Witch&#x27;s mischievous daughter Witch Child and son Warlock, who Magica is sometimes tasked with babysitting; another niece, Minima De Spell; and a cousin named Witch Matilda, who has served under Magica as an apprentice. Another character connected to Magica is Rosolio, a dim-witted goose who claims to be her fiancé despite always being rejected. He is supported in this by another grandmother of Magica&#x27;s, Caraldina (original Italian name), created in the Italian comics. In crossover comics, one of her most frequent companions is Mad Madam Mim.

Magica has an odd relationship with Scrooge. For example, in the 1987 &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode &quot;Till Nephews Do Us Part&quot;, she and Poe are invited to and attend Scrooge&#x27;s wedding. However, she has maintained an antagonistic relationship with him and his family, including Donald Duck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Gyro Gearloose, Gladstone Gander, as well as Daisy Duck and her nieces.

==In animation==
===&quot;DuckTales&quot;===
Magica appears as a recurring villain on the animated television show &quot;DuckTales&quot;, where she was voiced by June Foray (using a similar Eastern European accent to that of Natasha Fatale from &quot;Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle&quot;; in the Italian version, Magica&#x27;s voice actress, Sonia Scotti, depicted her with a heavy Neapolitan accent). Magica appears mostly in first-season episodes of the show. Although she appears as one of the series&#x27; major villains, she is frequently a source of comic relief; for example, in Magica&#x27;s final scene in the series, she attempts to send Scrooge&#x27;s &quot;tin man back to Oz&quot;, but instead sent herself elsewhere in a whirlwind when a Quackenyeeken Yeeker bird in fear, causing her jar of magic dust to break open and carry her away. On more than one occasion, her plan to obtain Scrooge&#x27;s dime backfires so spectacularly that she is forced to work with Scrooge to prevent a greater disaster. According to the show, her brother is Poe De Spell, who was transformed into a raven and serves as her magical familiar – in reference to Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot; – replacing Ratface from the comics. A similar reference had already been established in the German versions of Magica comics, where her raven is called &quot;Nimmermehr&quot; (&quot;Nevermore&quot;), referring to the recurring keyword from Poe&#x27;s poem.

In the 2017 reboot, Magica speaks with an English accent as she is voiced by Catherine Tate (former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; costar to David Tennant, who voices Scrooge McDuck in the new series). Within the reboot&#x27;s storyline, Magica has a history with Clan McDuck and a vendetta against Scrooge; he caused her to accidentally turn Poe into a raven and refused to stop him from flying away prior to the start of the series. During a climactic battle atop Mount Vesuvius (a famous setting from Tennant and Tate&#x27;s tenure on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;) 15 years prior, Scrooge trapped her physical body within his Number One Dime, though she was able to turn her own shadow into her &quot;niece&quot;, Lena De Spell. Throughout the first season, Magica manifests herself as a shadowy specter through Lena and uses her to gain the Duck family&#x27;s trust in order to acquire Scrooge&#x27;s Dime and free herself from imprisonment. Magica eventually regained her corporeal form during an eclipse that occurred in the season one finale, and proceeded to terrorize Duckburg with her dark magical powers. However, she is defeated and forced to flee after being stripped of her powers by the combined efforts of Scrooge and his family in destroying her staff. In the second-season episode, &quot;A Nightmare on Killmotor Hill!&quot;, Magica uses a telepathic helmet to invade Lena&#x27;s dreams and get her to give up her magic amulet, though she is foiled once more and Lena destroys her helmet. In a later episode, &quot;GlomTales!&quot;, she joins an alliance of Scrooge&#x27;s greatest enemies, led by Flintheart Glomgold, in a joint effort to destroy Scrooge and his family. Glomgold ends up losing his fortune, as well as that of the other villains&#x27;, to Louie Duck, causing the former&#x27;s fellow villains to turn on him. In season three, Magica regained her powers while helping Lena and her friends fend off the Phantom Blot, whose village Magica destroyed in the past. In turn, she is fended off by Lena, who had gained magical abilities of her own during the fight. Magica appears along with Scrooge&#x27;s other enemies to destroy him through a court trial, but fails again. Finally in the series finale, Magica and every villain the Duck family have faced were brainwashed by F.O.W.L. to fight the heroes, which was part of Bradford Buzzard&#x27;s plot to rid the world of adventures. Upon his defeat, Magica is enraged by him using her and the other villains, turned him into a non-sapient buzzard in revenge, and then teleports away.

===&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;===
Magica makes a cameo appearance in the &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; episode &quot;In Like Blunt&quot; along with the Beagle Boys and Flintheart Glomgold, among the bidders for the secret S.H.U.S.H. agent list.

She had a proper role in the Darkwing Duck comic published by Boom! Studios, teaming up with Negaduck (whom she had saved from the Crimebots from &quot;The Duck Knight Returns&quot;) in the story &quot;Crisis on Infinite Darkwings&quot;. By combining their powers and knowledge, they intended to unleash an army of brainwashed, alternate universe Darkwing Ducks on St. Canard, as it would be of benefit to both their agendas – her hope is to force Darkwing&#x27;s ally Launchpad McQuack to lead her to Scrooge&#x27;s Number One Dime. Magica and Negaduck had contempt for each other, which they kept hidden behind a &#x27;friendly&#x27; facade; early on, Negaduck sarcastically refers to his desire for a city and hers for &quot;...one dime&quot; as being &quot;similar ambitions&quot;.

Darkwing&#x27;s girlfriend Morgana McCawber, herself a witch, would assist the hero and battle Magica in magical combat. She swiftly drained Morgana&#x27;s magic using a source absorber, doubling her power, but lost it thanks to the intervention of an alternate Darkwing. This ended her control over the alternate reality Darkwings and ended Negaduck&#x27;s plan, and after the arrival of the monstrous demon Paddywhack, Magica fled the city.

She returned for the final arc of the series, a crossover with the &quot;DuckTales&quot; comic also published by Boom!, where she teamed up with other female Disney villains and exploited black &quot;slime&quot; that could turn normal people evil and villains into stronger forms. She used it to bring in an army of villains from Duckburg and St. Canard, as well as a brainwashed Phantom Blot, and tried to seize both cities so she could have all of Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s assets. To her dismay, the slime turned out to be a transformed Negaduck, who seized control of the plan before all the villains were banished to another dimension. This last arc was later rendered to be non-canonical, and not included in the omnibus collecting the series.

==Video games==
Magica appears in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System as the boss of the Transylvania stage, where she attacks Scrooge with lightning bolts and by transforming into a giant bird. In the remake &quot;DuckTales Remastered&quot;, Magica uses an expanded set of attacks (such as launching energy beams at Scrooge and summoning mirrors to hide in) and also plays a larger role in the game&#x27;s overall storyline. Just like in the cartoon, she is voiced by June Foray.

Other video game appearances by Magica include &quot;The Lucky Dime Caper: Starring Donald Duck&quot;, in which she kidnaps Donald&#x27;s nephews and steals Scrooge&#x27;s lucky dime, and in the 2000 video game &quot;Donald Duck: Goin&#x27; Quackers&quot; as the boss of a flying mansion. Magica also appears as the second secret playable character in the 2008 trivia video game &quot;Disney TH!NK Fast&quot;.

Magica De Spell is in the mobile RPG &quot;Disney Heroes Battle Mode&quot;.
==Attributes==

===Powers and abilities===
Magica De Spell is a very powerful witch with magical powers that include the ability to teleport over long distances, flight, the power to conjure and transmute matter, and the ability to turn herself into any animal she wants. Her actual capability to wield magic varies from writer to writer. Carl Barks&#x27; incarnation is quite powerful, with her naivete being her only prominent weakness. Don Rosa&#x27;s incarnation of Magica De Spell is, however, far more limited as she usually only uses magic through magical objects and in The Quest for Kalevala, Magica acknowledges she can&#x27;t use magic without a wand.

===Beliefs===
Unlike other people who think the Number One Dime to be a lucky charm, Magica doesn&#x27;t believe it to be the source of Scrooge&#x27;s wealth, but Scrooge&#x27;s wealth to be the source of the dime&#x27;s powers, as she only tries to steal it because it&#x27;s the first coin ever earned by the richest duck (or man) on Earth. It can be noticed when she steals the dime but gives it back when she realized she somehow caused the dime to lose such status. Examples of such stories are &quot;Of Ducks and Dimes and Destinies&quot;, when she travels in time to steal the dime in the very same day Scrooge earns it and gives it back after realizing that by preventing Scrooge from owning the dime, she would turn it into a coin that never belonged to him, or &quot;A Little Something Special&quot;, when she teams up with Flintheart Glomgold and the Beagle Boys in a plan made by Blackheart Beagle. She gives the dime back after realizing Scrooge wouldn&#x27;t be the richest man on Earth after the Beagle Boys steal his money. In Carl Barks&#x27;s &quot;Ten-Cent Valentine&quot;, it&#x27;s revealed she believes the dime must stay in one piece until she finally melts it or the spell won&#x27;t work. Huey, Dewey, and Louie trick Magica into thinking it was destroyed by a meat grinder.

Magica believes she is the disciple of the ancient sorceress Circe.

===&quot;DuckTales&quot; familiars===

The 1987 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series introduces Magica&#x27;s brother Poe (voiced Frank Welker), who was transformed into a non-anthropomorphic raven while maintaining his ability to speak. Although Magica has various transformation spells at her disposal, she is unable to turn Poe back into an anthropomorphic duck. In Poe&#x27;s debut episode, &quot;Send in the Clones&quot;, Magica explains that she needs the power of Scrooge&#x27;s Number One Dime to restore Poe. His name is a reference to Edgar Allan Poe, and Poe often ends his stanzas with the word &quot;nevermore&quot;, quoting the poem &quot;The Raven&quot;.

Following &quot;Send in the Clones&quot;, Poe reappeared in &quot;Magica&#x27;s Shadow War&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Harp&quot;. Outside these three &quot;DuckTales&quot; episodes, Poe&#x27;s only other appearances are in &quot;DuckTales&quot; comic book stories. Poe is not to be confused with Ratface, Magica&#x27;s pet raven from the &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; comic books.

In the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series, Poe is voiced by Martin Freeman and is initially presented as Magica&#x27;s duck brother instead of a raven. Appearing in a flashback in the episode &quot;The Life and Crimes of Scrooge McDuck!&quot;, Poe and his twin sister Magica ruled a village together, with the former keeping the latter in check. After Scrooge came to their village, he angered Magica and caused her to accidentally turn Poe into a raven. Lacking the knowledge to turn Poe back, she begged Scrooge to help her, but he refused, leading to Poe flying away. Magica attempted to find her brother, but was unable to and causes her hatred against Scrooge.

In &quot;Magica&#x27;s Magic Mirror&quot; she mentions her great grandma Tragica.

The 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot also introduces Magica&#x27;s &quot;niece&quot; Lena (voiced by Kimiko Glenn) – who is eventually revealed to be a magically created shadow creature and Magica&#x27;s spy. During the series&#x27; first season, Lena meets Webby Vanderquack in order to gain access to Scrooge&#x27;s Number One Dime so Magica can regain her corporeal form, but Lena slowly befriends Webby and later sacrifices herself to save her from Magica. During the second season, Webby manages to restore Lena, allowing her to exist independently of Magica. She is also revealed to have access to Magica&#x27;s powers, which initially scared her due to the possibility of becoming her. With the help of her friends though, she is able to overcome that fear and use her powers for good.

<text>Flintheart Glomgold is a cartoon character created in 1956 by Carl Barks. He is a South African American Pekin Duck and the business rival of Scrooge McDuck, usually portrayed as an ambitious, ruthless, and manipulative businessman who shares many of the same qualities as Scrooge—the drive for massive wealth, and the and creativity to obtain the same—but he lacks any of Scrooge&#x27;s tendencies towards generosity and compassion. In Don Rosa&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;, he is said to be a Boer.

Glomgold is one of Scrooge&#x27;s main rivals along with the Beagle Boys, Magica De Spell, and John D. Rockerduck, and also holds the title of being the &quot;Second Richest Duck in the World&quot; while Scrooge is the richest. His appearance is deliberately similar to that of Scrooge, but he is usually drawn with a full beard and sideburns as opposed to simple side-whiskers, black or purple frock coat instead of Scrooge&#x27;s red or blue one, and a dark tam o&#x27;shanter instead of Scrooge&#x27;s top hat.

==Comic history==

===Under Carl Barks===
Glomgold was originally created in 1956 by Scrooge McDuck artist and creator Carl Barks, the creator of much of the Duck universe. Characterized as an unrepentant miser, tycoon, plutocrat, and general villain, he rarely sees any problem with breaking the law, cheating, or using other unfair tactics in order to fulfill his goal of becoming the world&#x27;s richest duck. That makes him a &quot;broken mirror&quot; of Scrooge McDuck, whose own avarice is tempered with his belief in earning money strictly through honest means.

Glomgold first appeared in &quot;The Second-Richest Duck&quot;, first published in September 1956. In this story, Scrooge, who holds the title of the Richest Duck in the World, learns that a businessman from the valley of the Limpopo, South Africa has also claimed this title. Scrooge decides to confront this claimant to his title and travels to South Africa along with his nephew Donald and three grandnephews. The rest of the story concentrates on comparing and contrasting the two rivals during a race through &quot;The Heart of Africa&quot; (a recurring phrase in the story), by seeing who has the largest ball of string, because they are shown equal in everything else, from cash to gold mines to even who has the most pumpkins. The race is supposed to determine which one of them deserves the title.

The two characters resemble each other both in appearance and behavior though their main common point seems to be that they are extremely competitive, and neither of them can accept the idea of someone else being equal or superior to them. Flintheart, like Scrooge, keeps a percentage of his fortune in his own Money Bin, identical to that of Scrooge (with the exception of the external logo: a dollar sign on McDuck&#x27;s and a pound sign on Glomgold&#x27;s), while the rest of his fortune is invested in a worldwide financial empire of his own that equals that of Scrooge, although Scrooge&#x27;s main sources of wealth are his industries, while Flintheart&#x27;s are his diamond mines.

However, the main difference between them seems to be their way of life. Scrooge&#x27;s Money Bin is at the center of Duckburg, Calisota, United States, a constantly expanding industrial city, while Flintheart&#x27;s is in the center of a valley, located somewhere in the lands around Limpopo, surrounded by wildlife and away from human activities. While Scrooge finds himself surrounded by an extended family (see Clan McDuck, Duck family, and Coot Kin) and a large number of allies and rivals (see Scrooge McDuck Universe), Flintheart lives a life of solitude and seems to have no family, friends, or for that matter rivals except Scrooge himself. While Scrooge has his nephews helping him or advising him, Flintheart faces every situation alone. This appears to have hardened him – he is considerably more ruthless than Scrooge – but also leaves him vulnerable to being simply outnumbered by his rivals. Even at the end of the story, when Scrooge has won and Flintheart passes out after finding he is only second best, he has to be carried home by Huey, Dewey, and Louie because he has no one else to help him.

The solitary South African re-appeared to challenge Scrooge to a rematch in &quot;The Money Champ&quot;, first published in September 1959. This time the confrontation takes place in Scrooge&#x27;s grounds in Duckburg with the city&#x27;s population witnessing the event, and they only count their wealth in cash and not their investments, so they have to liquidate much of their fortunes. Flintheart uses a number of underhand plots against Scrooge, but his plans backfire when their cost in money also costs Flintheart his chance at victory. The story adds little to what was established in the previous one. However, for the first time, some panels concentrate on Flintheart&#x27;s thoughts, revealing that his insecurities about his own worth are the driving force behind both his efforts to best Scrooge and his dishonest tactics (since he doubts his ability to win in a direct confrontation), and that Flintheart believes said tactics are betrayals of his &quot;dear old mother&#x27;s fondest hopes&quot;.

Barks would use Flintheart for a third and last time in &quot;So Far and no Safari&quot;, first published in January 1966. This was one of the last stories Barks created before his retirement. The themes of the story are considerably darker than the two previous ones. Flintheart&#x27;s intentions towards Scrooge are clearly depicted as murderous. The story starts with Scrooge planning to participate in an auction for an old South African gold mine. It is considered exhausted, but Scrooge&#x27;s mechanics believe that the main vein of gold has not even been reached. While Scrooge is piloting his private plane over South Africa, with Donald, Huey, Dewey, and Louie as passengers, Flintheart appears piloting his own plane. It is equipped with machine guns, with which he shoots down Scrooge. While Scrooge is still trying to reach the auction, Flintheart repeatedly tries to get rid of him.

When Scrooge manages to reach the Kalahari Desert, Flintheart&#x27;s plane is revealed to be a bomber as well. Flintheart bombards Scrooge and his nephews, but misses. When he returns for a second bombing run, the Ducks have dressed some rocks with their clothing and have taken cover elsewhere. Flintheart mistakes the rocks for his targets and destroys them, noting that his rivals are now dinner for the jackals. His victory is short-lived, however. Because he was flying low, the bomb explosions damaged his plane&#x27;s fuel tank. He crash-lands the plane and finds himself in no better condition than Scrooge. The rest of the story presents Scrooge&#x27;s and Flintheart&#x27;s rival efforts to cross the Kalahari and reach the auction. The end of the story finds them at the auction, tired from their difficult treks, but still rivaling each other, while an exhausted Donald has fallen asleep. (Who finally obtained the gold mine is not revealed.) It is considered Flintheart&#x27;s darkest appearance and among his strongest and most memorable ones.

===After Barks===
During the ten years that followed his creator&#x27;s retirement the character made infrequent appearances, appearing only in four comic book stories. He was not nearly as recognizable as other rivals of Scrooge, like Italian sorceress Magica De Spell, who appeared far more often. Flintheart returned to prominence in 1979, when Egmont editors Lars Bergström and Stefan Printz-Påhlson decided to revive the character. Since then, Flintheart Glomgold has appeared in more than 100 Egmont stories, some of which depict him as an influential member of Duckburg&#x27;s Billionaires Club (which also includes Scrooge and John D. Rockerduck).

In Werner Wejp-Olsen and Daniel Branca&#x27;s 1981 comic book story &quot;The Top Treasure in Town&quot;, Flintheart&#x27;s grandfather, Stoneheart Glomgold, who in 1870 worked as a hansom cab driver in London, is introduced. In John Lustig and Vicar&#x27;s comic book story &quot;Family of Fore&quot; (2001) it is stated that Flintheart and Scrooge are both distantly related to the then-deceased Scottish golf enthusiast Bogey McDivot. McDivot has only been mentioned in that story. In Lars Jensen and Vicar&#x27;s 2002 comic book story &quot;Happy Birthday, Flintheart Glomgold&quot;, Glomgold&#x27;s nephew, Slackjaw Snorehead, is introduced. Slackjaw is a genial slacker; very friendly and cheerful as well as a genius with a talent for business. He prefers to hang around with his friends and do nothing all day rather than use his intellect productively, which is infuriating to Glomgold. In the English translation, Slackjaw at times uses South African slang (e.g. howzit or brasse).

In Lars Jensen and Marco Rota&#x27;s 2005 story &quot;The Glomgold Heritage&quot;, Flintheart&#x27;s father, Brickheart Glomgold, and mother appeared briefly. It is also revealed in this story that Flintheart&#x27;s grandfather, Stoneheart, was a Scotsman who moved to London and later on, together with his son Brickheart, traveled to South Africa after being wrongly accused for theft. From this experience, the Glomgolds learned that the world was unfair and cruel, and that they had to look out for themselves even if that meant acting outside the law.

In the 1988 &quot;DuckTales&quot; comic book story &quot;The Smart Nephew&quot; by Bob Gregory, Cosme Quartieri, and Jorge Sanchez, another nephew of Glomgold appears: the smart and brave Junior.

===Under Don Rosa===
In 1987 Keno Don Rosa created his first Scrooge McDuck story, &quot;The Son of the Sun&quot;, first published in July 1987. Rosa&#x27;s detailed style of drawing, references to Barks stories (by then considered classic) like &quot;Lost in the Andes!&quot;, detailed references to often obscure historical figures and events and strong characterization would later make Rosa fans consider him one of Barks&#x27; most popular &quot;successors&quot;. Those themes are all evident in his first story. It begins with Flintheart questioning Scrooge&#x27;s many successes as a treasure-hunter. He claims that discovering riches that are already concentrated by others is not that hard and that he could do it better than Scrooge if he decided to try. Soon, he is following Scrooge and his nephews in their latest treasure hunt, locating a hidden temple of Manco Cápac, who was the legendary founder of the Inca dynasty. The temple is hidden somewhere in the tops of the Andes and, according to inscriptions earlier found by Scrooge, supposed to contain a great treasure. In the course of the story Flintheart is shown to be one of Scrooge&#x27;s most charismatic, resourceful, and ruthless rivals.

Rosa, who admits to have a soft spot for the character, has used Flintheart in a growing number of stories and has offered him a sort of origin. In his stories, Flintheart is a Boer from the province of Transvaal. He was born around the same time as Scrooge and first met him during the Witwatersrand Gold Rush in 1886, a key event leading to the founding of Johannesburg. Like Scrooge, Flintheart was born in poverty and was working his way up the financial ladder. While unsuccessfully searching for diamonds, he attempted to steal the findings of more successful fellow miners. As a result, he was tied to the horns of a water buffalo and the animal was then sent running. Flintheart was found and saved by Scrooge. Flintheart offered to be the guide of the recently arrived gold miner from Scotland, since he knew the territory. Scrooge accepted him as a needed companion and friend. But at night while Scrooge was sleeping, Flintheart stole his ox-cart along with all his equipment and supplies and left him alone in the wilderness. Having underestimated Scrooge, he was surprised when Scrooge caught up to him, furious and vengeful. When Scrooge finished with him, Flintheart was publicly humiliated, thoroughly embittered, and imprisoned for theft. The two rivals made vows to themselves that helped shape some of their character traits. Scrooge vowed to never trust anybody ever again, in order not to be betrayed again. Apparently this is the source of Scrooge&#x27;s distrust towards others whether they are allies, rivals, or complete strangers and the reason he is secretive about his thoughts and emotions. On the other hand, a completely defeated Flintheart vowed that he will work to become so rich that nobody can humiliate him again (see Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck – Part VI: The Terror of the Transvaal). Because Scrooge officially meets Glomgold for the first time during &quot;The Second Richest Duck&quot; in 1956, Don Rosa makes sure Glomgold&#x27;s name is never mentioned until after he and Scrooge have parted ways. Since Glomgold gets Scrooge&#x27;s name, some fans could think he is more interested in defeating and humiliating Scrooge as revenge for getting imprisoned rather than becoming the world&#x27;s richest duck. According to Rosa&#x27;s unofficial timelines, it would take him twenty years of hard work as a diamond miner till finally he became rich in 1906 by his profits. He would spend the next fifty years working his way up the financial ladder both by hard efforts and dishonest methods when needed.

Don Rosa also revealed in at least two stories another thing that makes Flintheart a to Scrooge: the Number One Rand, the first coin Flintheart Glomgold ever earned (or stole). In &quot;Return to Plain Awful&quot;, this rand makes his first appearance, a cameo, and has nothing to do with the story, alongside a framed pound note labelled as Glomgold&#x27;s &quot;No. 1 Pound&quot; and a diamond under a glass dome labelled as &quot;My First Diamond&quot;. In &quot;A Little Something Special&quot;, the Rand makes an equally small but more relevant role. Magica De Spell teamed up with him and the Beagle Boys to get the Number One Dime. Scrooge reminds Magica he will no longer be the richest duck in the world after they steal his fortune, and the Dime will be worthless to her. Based on the advice Scrooge gives her in exchange for his dime back, Magica steals Flintheart&#x27;s first rand. To make things worse for Glomgold, Magica takes the Beagle Boys with her to the Valley of Limpopo, where they carry all they can of Flintheart&#x27;s cash. Despite the fact he teamed up with them in that story against Scrooge, he still dares to ask what did he do to deserve that.

Notable is the fact that Flintheart Glomgold&#x27;s first coin could not be a rand, because the South African Rand did not come into existence until 1961. Before a unified South Africa in 1910 (whereupon the South African pound was introduced), many authorities in the region issued coins and banknotes in their own currencies, often equivalent to the Pound Sterling of the Cape of Good Hope colony that had existed since 1825. Adding it to the fact that Don Rosa&#x27;s stories usually take place in the 1950s, this meant it would be impossible for anyone to own a rand in such stories.

==Animation and other appearances==

An animated version of the character appeared in the TV series &quot;DuckTales&quot;, which started airing on September 18, 1987. The Second Richest Duck was among the series&#x27; most prominent characters, and this helped his introduction to a wider audience. But some drastic changes came to the character. He lives an elaborate but decaying mansion in Duckburg, is depicted as wearing a traditional Scottish kilt. His voice actor Hal Smith gave him a gravelly and recognisably Scottish accent. No reference to South Africa is ever made. The previously unaffiliated Beagle Boys were now depicted as working for him on an occasional basis. In &quot;Attack of the Metal Mites&quot;, Glomgold sends the metal mites to eat whole money from Scrooge&#x27;s bin. Glomgold almost succeeds when Fenton Crackshell stopped the metal mites and the last ones retrieved by Dijon spread in Glomgold&#x27;s office. The biggest humiliation of all this is the fact Scrooge finds a way to earn honest money with the metal mites captured by Fenton. In &quot;&quot;The Golden Goose&quot; (Part 2)&quot; after stealing a magical Golden Goose, Glomgold seems to have beaten Scrooge as &quot;The Richest Duck In the World&quot; until he is turned into gold himself. 

Glomgold is also a recurring antagonist in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; comic book series, notably the series &quot;Scrooge&#x27;s Quest&quot;. In the final chapter of that series, &quot;All That Glitters Is Not Glomgold&quot;, Glomgold has taken advantage of Scrooge&#x27;s long absence and distraction to buy out all of Scrooge&#x27;s assets and seize control of Duckburg. While Scrooge was a more benevolent businessman, Glomgold is determined to soak the city&#x27;s people for as much money as he can, charging exorbitant prices for food and services, while keeping their lives as closely regimented as possible. Scrooge cannily uses Glomgold&#x27;s own paranoia against him, wandering around town, making apparently innocuous inspections of Glomgold&#x27;s businesses, and causing Glomgold to tear apart his own holdings, looking for Scrooge&#x27;s sabotage. By the end of the comic, Glomgold has destroyed all of his assets in Duckburg, and Scrooge has regained his own fortune. As Scrooge explains to his nephews, &quot;Glomgold is so evil and sneaky that he thinks everyone is as evil and sneaky as he is.&quot; Yet, in the final pages of the comic, Glomgold seems to be perfectly content, living in a wooden shanty in Duckburg&#x27;s slums, sharing a meager meal with one of his former clerks. As Glomgold explains, now that he has nothing left, there&#x27;s nothing further that Scrooge can do to him, and Glomgold is looking forward to making himself rich again, since making a fortune is much more satisfying than having one. In this he reflects much of Scrooge&#x27;s own philosophy.
In the Disney series &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; episode &quot;In Like Blunt&quot;, Glomgold makes a cameo appearance-along with the Beagle Boys and Magica De Spell-as a bidder for the secret S.H.U.S.H. agent list.

Flintheart also appears in the 1989 &quot;DuckTales&quot; video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). After Scrooge completes all the regular levels, Flintheart challenges him to a race in which the winner will take all of the treasure Scrooge has acquired. Glomgold also appears in the 1993 video game sequel &quot;DuckTales 2&quot;, also for the NES, once again trying to obtain the treasures that Scrooge had collected and also kidnaps Webby in order to get Scrooge to hand over the treasure. When he does Glomgold is revealed to be the final boss the D-1000. In &quot;&quot;, Glomgold is voiced by Brian George (Hal Smith had died in 1994), and his role is greatly expanded. In &quot;Remastered&quot;, Glomgold attacks Scrooge in the Himalayas, attempting to shoot Launchpad out of the skies, but is thwarted by Scrooge. He appears again on the Moon, attempting to collect the Green Cheese of Longevity before Scrooge does. Later, he forms an uneasy alliance with Scrooge to help him rescue his nephews from Magica De Spell, but later reveals that he was in cahoots with her all along in order to get Scrooge&#x27;s Number One Dime from him for her own purposes. As in the original, Scrooge must race Glomgold and Magica in order to reclaim his Number One Dime in the end. Glomgold appeared in &quot;Ducktales: Scrooge&#x27;s Loot&quot;, and also as Boss in the RPG card game titled &quot;The Duckforce Rises&quot; for Android and iOS.

Glomgold is the main antagonist in the PC game &quot;&quot;. In the intro scene, he barges into Scrooge&#x27;s office, lamenting about he is tired being the second richest duck in the world, and challenges Scrooge to a wealth contest sponsored by Dime Magazine: in the next 30 days, the one who collects the most treasure shall be the Duck of the Year. The contest is held in the Isle of Macaroon, which is a homage to the four-parter &quot;Catch as Cash Can&quot; episode, except that the contest gives 30 days, not 10. Just like in the episodes, Glomgold hires the Beagle Boys against Scrooge and his nephews, and will constantly try to race Scrooge to the treasure locations, or snatching treasure from other locations. The ultimate goal of the game is to collect more money, thus, beating Glomgold and becoming Duck of the Year.

Glomgold appeared on the 2012 list of the &quot;Forbes Fictional 15&quot;, a compilation of the wealthiest characters in fiction. A spike in the price of gold during the late 2000s and early 2010s allowed Glomgold to become the second-wealthiest fictional character. His nemesis, Scrooge McDuck (who has appeared in most of the &quot;Fictional 15&quot; lists to date), surpassed him in the 2013 list, in which Glomgold did not appear.

Glomgold, now voiced by Keith Ferguson, returns as Scrooge&#x27;s nemesis in the 2017 reboot of &quot;DuckTales&quot;. While Glomgold now appears much stouter than in previous versions, his outfit and personality remains relatively unchanged from the 1987 version. He is also the head of Glomgold Industries, through which he builds up his fortune through personal branding and making products as cheaply as possible. Throughout the first season, it was initially implied that this Glomgold is South African but pretends to be Scottish in order to outdo Scrooge McDuck. This is confirmed in the second season episode, &quot;The Ballad of Duke Baloney!&quot;, where it is revealed that Glomgold was born Duke Baloney, a shoeshine boy who did Scrooge&#x27;s shoes and given a dime as payment to teach him self-reliance, only for Duke to instead feel cheated and create his &quot;Glomgold&quot; persona over the years to get revenge.

==Predecessor==
A few years prior to Flintheart&#x27;s debut, another character was described as the World&#x27;s Second-Richest Duck. His only appearance took place in Carl Barks&#x27; story &quot;Turkey With All the Schemings&quot;. In that story, Donald found himself unable to afford a Christmas dinner and decided to trick Scrooge into paying for dinner for him. To do so, Donald posed as a South American businessman named Petrolio de Vaselino and had Scrooge take him to the Ritz. While eating dessert, Donald accidentally ate his phony moustache, making him look like the Duke of Baloni, described by Scrooge as the World&#x27;s Second-Richest Duck. By coincidence, Scrooge had a newspaper article talking about the Duke visiting Duckburg. The fact Scrooge remained willing to make business with him suggests the Duke never claimed to be richer than him. Not much else is known about the real Duke since he just made a cameo at the beginning of the last page and his only purpose in the story was cluing (via his presence) Scrooge to the fact he was dealing with an imposter. After removing Donald&#x27;s wig, Scrooge was determined to make Donald pay. He asked the waiter if the restaurant was for sale and was given a price of one million dollars. In a surprising move, as he had spent the whole last night trying to make sure Donald would not leave and force him to pay the bill, Scrooge quickly pulled the required amount from his pockets and bought the restaurant. Donald then was forced to wash the dishes to pay the bill. It is never said when Flintheart became richer than the Duke or if the two ever met. However, this is homaged in the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; animated series, where it is revealed that &quot;Duke Baloney&quot; is Flintheart&#x27;s birth name.

<doc id="72789" wikidata="Q205355" url="?curid=72789" title="Central line (London Underground)">
<text>The Central line is a London Underground line that runs between or in the west, and or Woodford via Hainault in the north-east, via the West End, the City, and the East End. Printed in red on the Tube map, the line serves 49 stations over , making it the network&#x27;s longest line. It is one of only two lines on the Underground network to cross the Greater London boundary, the other being the Metropolitan line. One of London&#x27;s deep-level railways traversing narrow tunnels, Central line trains are smaller than those on British main lines.

The line was opened as the Central London Railway in 1900, crossing central London on an east–west axis along the central shopping street of Oxford Street to the financial centre of the City of London. It was later extended to the western suburb of Ealing. In the 1930s, plans were created to expand the route into the new suburbs, taking over steam-hauled outer-suburban routes to the borders of London and beyond to the east. These projects were mostly realised after the Second World War, when construction stopped and the unused tunnels were used as air-raid shelters and factories. However, suburban growth was limited by the Metropolitan Green Belt: of the planned expansions one (to , Buckinghamshire) was cut short and the eastern terminus of ultimately closed in 1994 due to low patronage; part of this section between Epping and Ongar later became the Epping Ongar Railway. The Central line has mostly been operated by automatic train operation since a major refurbishment in the 1990s, although all trains still carry drivers. Many of its stations are of historic interest, from turn-of-the-century Central London Railway buildings in west London to post-war modernist designs on the West Ruislip and Hainault branches, as well as Victorian-era Eastern Counties Railway and Great Eastern Railway buildings east of , from when the line to Epping was a rural branch line.

In terms of total passengers, the Central line is the third busiest on the Underground. In 2019, over 300 million passenger journeys were recorded on the line. As of 2013, it operated the second-most frequent service on the network, with 34 trains per hour (tph) operating for half-an-hour in the westbound direction during the morning peak, and between 27 and 30 tph during the rest of the peak. The Elizabeth line, which began most of its core operation from 24 May 2022, provides interchanges with the Central line at Stratford, , , Ealing Broadway, and , relieving overcrowding.

== History ==

=== Central London Railway ===
The Central London Railway (CLR) was given permission in 1891 for a tube line between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and a station at Cornhill, and the following year an extension to Liverpool Street was authorised, with a station at Bank instead of at Cornhill. The line was built following the streets above rather than running underneath buildings, because purchase of wayleave under private properties would have been expensive. While the tracks in opposite directions mostly run side-by-side, in some places one line runs above another due to lack of space, with platforms at different levels at St Paul&#x27;s, Chancery Lane and Notting Hill Gate stations. The tunnels were bored with the nominal diameter of , increased on curves, reduced to near to stations. The tunnels generally rise approaching a station, to aid braking, and fall when leaving, to aid acceleration.
The Central London Railway was the first underground railway to have the station platforms illuminated electrically. All the platforms were lit by Crompton automatic electric arc lamps, and other station areas by incandescent lamps. Both the City and South London Railway and the Waterloo and City Railway were lit by gas lamps, primarily because the power stations for these lines had been designed with no spare capacity to power electric lighting. With the white glazed tiling, all underground Central London Railway platforms were very brightly lit. The use of electric lighting was further made possible because the Central London was also the first tube railway to use AC electrical distribution and the substation transformers, not compatible with DC, were able to reduce the voltage to the level required for lighting. Earlier tube lines used DC power generators at the 500 volts required to run the trains.

The line between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Bank was formally opened on 30 June 1900, public services beginning on 30 July. With a uniform fare of 2d the railway became known as the &quot;Twopenny Tube&quot;. It was initially operated by electric locomotives, with motor armatures built directly on the axles to eliminate noise-producing gearboxes, hauling carriages. This did not allow springing, and the locomotives&#x27; considerable unsprung weight caused much vibration in the buildings above the line, so that the railway rebuilt the locomotives to use geared drives. This allowed higher-speed and lighter motors to be used, which reduced the unsprung, and total, weight of the locomotive. The railway also tried an alternative approach: it converted four coaches to accommodate motors and control gear. Two of these experimental motor coaches were used in a 6-coach train, the control gear being operated by the system used on the Waterloo and City Railway. The modified locomotives were a considerable improvement, but lighter purpose-designed motor coaches were even better. The CLR ordered 64 new motor cars designed to use Sprague&#x27;s recently developed traction control system. The CLR was exclusively using the resulting electric multiple units by 1903.

In July 1907, the fare was increased to 3d for journeys of more than seven or eight stations. The line was extended westwards with a loop serving a single platform at Wood Lane for the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition. A reduced fare of 1d, for a journey of three or fewer stations, was introduced in 1909, and season tickets became available from 1911. The extension to Liverpool Street opened the following year, providing access to the Great Eastern Railway station and the adjacent Broad Street railway station by escalators. The Central London Railway was absorbed into the Underground Group on 1 January 1913.

In 1911, the Great Western Railway won permission for a line from Ealing Broadway to a station near to the CLR&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station, with a connection to the West London Railway, and agreement to connect the line to the Central London Railway, and for the CLR to run trains to Ealing Broadway. Construction of the extension from the CLR to Ealing Broadway started in 1912, but opening was delayed by World War I. The CLR purchased new rolling stock for the extension, which arrived in 1915 and was stored before being lent to the Bakerloo line. The rolling stock returned when the extension opened in 1920.

In 1912, plans were published for a railway from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to Turnham Green and Gunnersbury, allowing the Central London Railway to run trains on London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) tracks to Richmond. The route was authorised in 1913, but work had not begun by the outbreak of war the following year. In 1919, an alternative route was published, with a tunnelled link to the disused L&amp;SWR tracks south of their Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station then via Hammersmith (Grove Road) railway station. Authorisation was granted in 1920, but the connection was never built, and the L&amp;SWR tracks were used by the Piccadilly line when it was extended west of Hammersmith in 1932.

=== London Transport and the Second World War ===
On 1 July 1933, the Central London Railway and other transport companies in the London area were amalgamated to form the London Passenger Transport Board, generally known as London Transport. The railway was known as the &quot;Central London Line&quot;, becoming the &quot;Central line&quot; in 1937. The 1935–40 New Works Programme included a major expansion of the line. To the west new tracks were to be built parallel with the Great Western Railway&#x27;s New North Main Line as far as Denham. To the east, new tunnels would run to just beyond Stratford station, where the line would be extended over the London &amp; North Eastern Railway suburban branch to Epping and Ongar in Essex, as well as a new underground line between Leytonstone and Newbury Park mostly under Eastern Avenue so as to serve the new suburbs of north Ilford and the Hainault Loop. Twenty two level crossings would also be removed, grade separating the line. Platforms at central London stations would also be lengthened to allow for 8-car trains.

Construction started, the tunnels through central London being expanded and realigned and the stations lengthened, but it proved impossible to modify Wood Lane station to take 8-car trains and a new station at White City was authorised in 1938. The line was converted to the London Underground four-rail electrification system in 1940. The positive outer rail is higher than on other lines, because even after reconstruction work the tunnels are slightly smaller. Most of the tunnels for the extensions to the east of London had been built by 1940, but work slowed due to the outbreak of the Second World War until eventually being suspended in June. The unused tunnels between Leytonstone and Newbury Park were equipped by the Plessey Company as an aircraft components factory, opening in March 1942 and employing 2,000 people. Elsewhere, people used underground stations as night shelters during air raids. The unopened Bethnal Green station had space for 10,000 people. In March 1943, 173 people died there in a crowd crush when a woman entering the shelter fell at the bottom of the steps and those following fell on top of her.

===Post war===

Construction restarted after the war, and the western extension opened as far as Greenford in 1947 and West Ruislip in 1948. The powers to extend the line to Denham were never used due to post-war establishment of the Green Belt around London, which restricted development of land in the area. The eastern extension opened as far as Stratford in December 1946, with trains continuing without passengers to reverse in the cutting south of Leyton. In 1947, the line opened to Leytonstone, and then Woodford and Newbury Park. Stations from Newbury Park to Woodford via Hainault and from Woodford to Loughton were served by tube trains from 1948. South of Newbury Park, the west-facing junction with the main line closed in the same year to allow expansion of Ilford carriage depot. The extension transferred to London Underground management in 1949, when Epping began to be served by Central line trains. The single line to Ongar was served by a steam autotrain operated by British Rail (BR) until 1957, when the line was electrified. BR trains accessed the line via a link from Temple Mills East to Leyton.

On 8 April 1953, 12 people were killed and 46 were injured as a result of a rear-end collision in a tunnel just to the east of Stratford station, caused by driver error after a signal failure.

The Central line stations east of Stratford kept their goods service for a time, being worked from Temple Mills, with the Hainault loop stations served via Woodford. The BR line south of Newbury Park closed in 1956 and Hainault loop stations lost their goods service in 1965, the rest of the stations on the line following in 1966. Early morning passenger trains from Stratford (Liverpool Street on Sundays) ran to Epping or Loughton until 1970. The single-track section from Epping to Ongar was electrified in 1957 and then operated as a shuttle service using short tube trains. However, carrying only 100 passengers a day and losing money, the section closed in 1994, and is now used by the heritage Epping Ongar Railway.

The entire Central line was shut between January and March 2003, after 32 passengers were injured when a train derailed at Chancery Lane due to a traction motor falling on to the track. The line was not fully reopened until June. In 2003, the infrastructure of the Central line was partly privatised in a public–private partnership, managed by the Metronet consortium. Metronet went into administration in 2007, and Transport for London (TfL) took over its responsibilities.

=== Railway line ===

The Central line is long and serves 49 stations. The line is predominantly double-track, widened to three tracks for short sections south of Leytonstone and west of White City; no track is shared with any other line, though some sections run parallel to other routes. Total track length is , of which is in tunnel; this track is electrified with a four-rail DC system: a central conductor rail is energised at −210 V and a rail outside the running rail at +420 V, giving a potential difference of 630 V.

The single-track line north of Epping, which closed in 1994, is now the Epping Ongar heritage railway. Shuttle services operate, mostly on some weekends and for special events, between North Weald and Ongar and North Weald and Coopersale. These do not call at Blake Hall, as the station platform was removed by London Transport after the station closed, and the remaining building is now a private residence.

The section between Leyton and just south of Loughton is the oldest railway alignment in use on the current London Underground system, having been opened on 22 August 1856 by the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR). Loughton to Epping was opened on 24 April 1865 by the ECR&#x27;s successor, the Great Eastern Railway (GER), along with the section to Ongar. The Hainault Loop was originally the greater part of the Fairlop Loop opened by the GER on 1 May 1903.

The line has three junctions:
* Woodford Junction is a flat junction
* north of Leytonstone the branch to Newbury Park descends into tube tunnels under the older route to Woodford
* west of North Acton there is another burrowing junction separating the lines to Ealing Broadway and West Ruislip.

The line has the shortest escalator on the London Underground system, at Stratford (previously at Chancery Lane), with a rise of and, at Stratford and Greenford, the only stations where escalators take passengers &quot;up&quot; to the trains. The escalator at Greenford was the last one with wooden treads on the system until it was replaced in March 2014. They were exempt from fire regulations because they were outside the tunnel system.

The line has the shallowest underground Tube platforms on the system, at Redbridge, just below street level, and the sharpest curve, the Caxton Curve, between Shepherds Bush and White City.

== Rolling stock ==

=== Former rolling stock ===

When the railway opened in 1900, it was operated by electric locomotives hauling carriages with passengers boarding via lattice gates at each end. The locomotives had a large unsprung mass, which caused vibrations that could be felt in the buildings above the route. After an investigation by the Board of Trade, by 1903 the carriages had been adapted to run as trailers and formed with new motor cars into electric multiple units. The Central London Railway trains normally ran with six cars: four trailers and two motor-cars, although some trailers were later equipped with control equipment to allow trains to be formed with 3 cars. Work started in 1912 on an extension to Ealing Broadway, and new more powerful motor-cars were ordered. These arrived in 1915, but completion of the extension was delayed because of World War I, and the cars were stored. In 1917, they were lent to the Bakerloo line, where they ran on the newly opened extension to Watford Junction. Returning in 1920/21, and formed with trailers converted from the original carriages, they became the Ealing Stock. In 1925–28, the trains were rebuilt, replacing the gated ends with air-operated doors, allowing the number of guards to be reduced to two. After reconstruction of the Central London Railway tunnels, the trains were replaced by Standard Stock transferred from other lines and the last of the original trains ran in service in 1939.

The Standard Stock ran as 6-car trains until 1947, when 8-car trains became possible after Wood Lane was replaced by a new station at White City. More cars were transferred from other lines as they were replaced by 1938 Stock. In the early 1960s, there was a plan to re-equip the Piccadilly line with new trains and transfer its newer Standard Stock to the Central line to replace the older cars there, some of which had been stored in the open during the Second World War and were becoming increasingly unreliable. However, after the first deliveries of 1959 Stock were running on the Piccadilly it was decided to divert this stock to the Central line, together with extra non-driving motor cars to lengthen the trains from 7-car to 8-car. 1962 Stock was ordered to release the 1959 Stock for the Piccadilly line. The last Standard Stock train ran on the Central line in 1963, and by May 1964 all 1959 Stock had been released to the Piccadilly line.

The single track section from Epping to Ongar was not electrified until 1957, prior to which the service was operated by an autotrain, carriages attached to a steam locomotive capable of being driven from either end, hired from British Railways, and an experimental AEC three-car lightweight diesel multiple unit operated part of the shuttle service Monday-Friday in June 1952. Upon electrification, 1935 Stock was used, until replaced by four-car sets of 1962 Stock specially modified to cope with the limited current. The section closed in 1994, and is now the heritage Epping Ongar Railway.

A shuttle operated on the section from Hainault to Woodford after a train of 1960 Stock was modified to test the automatic train operation system to be used on the Victoria line. As each 1967 Stock train was delivered, it ran in test for three weeks on the shuttle service.

=== Current rolling stock ===
When the signalling on the Central line needed replacement by the late 1980s, it was decided to bring forward the replacement of the 1962 Stock, due at about the time as the replacement of the 1959 Stock. The signalling was to be replaced with an updated version of the Automatic Train Operation (ATO) system used on the Victoria line, the line traction supply boosted and new trains built. Prototype trains were built with two double and two single doors hung on the outside of each carriage of the train, and with electronic traction equipment that gave regenerative and rheostatic braking.

In accordance with this plan, the first 8-car trains of 1992 Stock entered service in 1993, and while the necessary signalling works for ATO were in progress, One Person Operation (OPO) was phased in between 1993 and 1995. Automatic train protection was commissioned from 1995 to 1997 and ATO from 1999 to 2001, with a centralised control centre in West London.

The five-year Central Line Improvement Programme (CLIP) to refurbish the 30-year-old trains started in 2023, as it was considered cheaper than replacing the trains. New motors, lighting, doors, and seats will be installed, and the trains will have passenger information displays, wheelchair areas and CCTV. The programme is being carried out at a new Train Modification Unit (TMU) in Acton, and had been expected to complete in late 2023. However in November 2020 TfL reported that this had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with expected completion by the end of 2025; only one refurbished train had re-entered service. A timetable that would improve train frequencies, relieving delays and overcrowding, would not be implemented until December 2024. An expert suggested that in hindsight, given the problems with CLIP, it would have been better to buy new trains.

=== Future rolling stock ===

In the mid 2010s, TfL began a process of ordering new rolling stock to replace trains on the Piccadilly, Central, Bakerloo and Waterloo &amp; City lines. TfL explained that the 1992 Stock used on the Central and Waterloo &amp; City lines was significantly less reliable than more modern rolling stock. A feasibility study into the new trains showed that new generation trains and re-signalling could increase capacity on the Central line by 25%, with 36 trains per hour.

In June 2018, the Siemens Mobility Inspiro design was selected. These trains would have an open gangway design, wider doorways, air conditioning and the ability to run automatically with a new signalling system. TfL could only afford to order Piccadilly line trains at a cost of £1.5bn. However, the contract with Siemens includes an option for 100 trains for the Central line in the future. This would take place after the delivery of the Piccadilly line trains in the 2030s.

=== Depots ===
There are three depots: Ruislip, Hainault and White City. White City depot first opened in 1900 when the initial line went into operation; Ruislip and Hainault depots were completed in 1939. During the Second World War, anti-aircraft guns were made at Ruislip Depot and the U.S. Army Transportation Corps assembled rolling stock at Hainault between 1943 and 1945. As part of the construction of the Westfield London shopping centre, the depot at White City was replaced underground, opening in 2007.
== Services ==
During the off-peak, services on the Central line are grouped by branch lines: trains on the West Ruislip branch run to/from Epping, while trains to/from Ealing Broadway run on the Hainault Loop. Services at peak times are less structured, and trains can run between any two terminus stations at irregular intervals (e.g. from Ealing Broadway to Epping).

, the typical off-peak service, in trains per hour (tph), is:
*9 tph between and ;
*3 tph between and ;
*3 tph between and ;
*6 tph between Ealing Broadway and (via );
*3 tph between Ealing Broadway and Newbury Park;
*3 tph between and Hainault.

The above services combine to give a total of 24 trains per hour each way (one every 2 minutes and 30 seconds) in the core section between White City and Leytonstone. At peak times, the frequency increases further, with up to 35 trains per hour each way in the core section.

A 24-hour Night Tube service began on the Central line on 19 August 2016, running on Friday and Saturday nights. Night tube services are:
*3 tph between Ealing Broadway and Hainault (via Newbury Park)
*3 tph between White City and Loughton

===Peak-time frequency===
In September 2013, the frequency in the morning peak period was increased to 35 trains per hour, giving the line the most intensive train service in the UK at the time. Before that date, the Victoria line held the record with 33 trains per hour; it regained it in May 2017 with an increased frequency of 36 trains per hour (one every 100 seconds) during peak periods.

== Proposed and cancelled extensions ==

=== Hillingdon ===
The Central crosses over the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines&#x27; shared Uxbridge branch near West Ruislip depot, and a single track linking the two routes was laid in 1973. In the 2010s, the London Borough of Hillingdon has lobbied TfL to divert some or all Central trains along this to Uxbridge, as West Ruislip station is located in a quiet suburb and Uxbridge is a much more densely populated regional centre. TfL has stated that the link will be impossible until the Metropolitan line&#x27;s signalling is upgraded in 2017.

=== Additional stations ===
The Central line runs directly below Shoreditch High Street station and an interchange has been desired locally since it opened in 2010. The station would lie between Liverpool Street and Bethnal Green, one of the longest gaps between stations in inner London. Although there would be benefits to this interchange, it was ruled out on grounds of cost, the disruption it would cause to the Central line while being built and because the platforms would be too close to sidings at Liverpool Street and would not be developed until after the Crossrail-developed Elizabeth line became fully operational.

The developers of the &quot;First Central&quot; business park at Park Royal, west London, were planning a new station between North Acton and Hanger Lane. This would have served the business park and provided a walking-distance interchange with Park Royal Piccadilly line station. This is not being actively pursued; London Underground said that the transport benefits of a Park Royal station on the Central line were not sufficient to justify the costs of construction.

=== Harlow extension ===
In 2021, Harlow District Council proposed extending the line from its eastern terminus in Epping to Harlow. They argued this would reduce travel times to Epping and London, and help with efforts to add 19,000 new homes to the town and expand the population to 130,000. However, no funding has been allocated for this proposed extension.

<text>The VAZ-2108, known as the [[Lada]] Samara in much of Western Europe (codenamed and later officially badged as the Lada Sputnik in its native Russia), is a series of small family cars produced by Soviet/Russian vehicle manufacturer AvtoVAZ under the Lada brand between 1984 and 2013. The model name Samara originally was used only for exported models, in the Soviet Union the same model was called Sputnik (&quot;fellow traveler&quot;, &quot;satellite&quot;) until 1991, when the sedan version of the Samara entered in production, using the export name. It was the first front-wheel drive serial car built in the Soviet Union sincer the LuAZ-969V. The Samara had been modified and restyled during the years of production before it was finally discontinued in December 2013.
==VAZ-2108==
The Samara was a car that combined a robust build and ease of maintenance with a modern style. It was produced in various three, four and five-door designs with 1.1, 1.3 and 1.5-litre petrol engines. VAZ had hoped that the Samara would enable it to compete for sales in the mainstream European car market, where the company&#x27;s traditional Fiat 124-based &quot;Zhiguli&quot; models were looked upon as increasingly outmoded and out of date. It was the second autonomous design from VAZ (the first was the Niva SUV), and the first model not based on the Fiat 124 mechanicals.

==Development==
VAZ had made their first front-wheel drive prototype, the VAZ-1101, in the early 1970s. The engine from the Fiat 127 was used. Further development of this project led to the &quot;Ladoga&quot; three-door hatchback prototype in 1976. The decision to build the Samara was taken on 16 September 1978, the intention being to build a car with strong potential sales in Western European export markets. Proposals for a distinctive saloon, four-door, and both three- and five-door hatchback were considered; it was decided instead the saloon should share the three-door hatchback&#x27;s sheetmetal forward of the C-pillar. (Design work on the four-door went toward the VAZ-2110 instead.) During its development, VAZ designers paid careful attention to the contemporary Renault 9, Volkswagen Golf, Ford Escort Mark III, Opel Kadett, and Volvo 340, which would be the new VAZ-2108&#x27;s main competitors. Front suspension was MacPherson struts, rear by torsion bar. It also had rack and pinion steering, another Soviet first.

On 31 December 1979, the first VAZ-2108 prototype was completed. It strongly resembled the earlier Ladoga, and the VAZ-1106 saloon. While named &quot;Sputnik&quot; at home, it was more commonly known as the Vos&#x27;merka (&quot;Eighth&quot;) after the last digit in the model code. The export version was named after the Samara River, a tributary to the Volga. The first cars left the production line on 18 December 1984. These, the three-door hatchbacks (the only model available at first), were powered by a belt-driven SOHC 1,288 cc inline-four with , and were fitted with a four-speed gearbox. The three-door was joined by a five-door, and by models with 1,099 cc (a destroked version of the 1.3) or 1,499 cc (a bored-out 1288) engines. (The head was developed in co-operation with Porsche, though most Western observers assumed Porsche&#x27;s involvement went beyond just engines, and the carburetors in connection with Solex.)

In 1987, the model range was joined by the 21083, with a 1,499 cc engine and five-speed gearbox, and the 21081, with a , 1,099 cc engine. The 1.1 was an export-only variant. Top speeds were (1.1), (1.3) and (1.5); fuel economy was (1099), (1288), or (1499). VAZ also debuted the 2109 five-door hatchback that year, also available with the 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5-litre engines. In 1989, the 21099 saloon followed, which had a new bonnet, grille, wings, and -longer rear overhang, as well as an improved dashboard. The 21099&#x27;s front-end styling was adopted on the 2109 in 1992 and the 2108 in 1994.

A number of other minor alterations followed, including fuel-injected engines to meet emissions regulations in export markets. On the earlier Samaras the front clip had been a separate piece, surrounding the headlights. On the sedan version, the fenders go all the way up to the headlights and the lip of the bonnet dips between the headlights and meets the slimmer grille. Full production of the 21099 began in December 1990, with models 210993 (1288), 21099 (1499). The saloon, intended as a premium model compared to the hatchback, was given a distinctive branding in some export markets: Diva (Belgium), Sagona (France), Forma (Germany). Belgium also offered a locally built convertible. The 1.1 and 1.3 were eventually taken out of production, having already been withdrawn from export markets, while the 1.5&#x27;s power increased to .

===Special models===
A Wankel engined Samara three-door hatchback, the 2108–91, powered by a two-rotor VAZ-415 (with two 654 cc rotors) was sold in Russia only, and only in very small numbers. With a five-speed gearbox, it was priced at 56,000 rubles. Due to severe reliability problems, this remained rare, most commonly bought by police and other agencies to use as a pursuit vehicle, for which its top speed was ideal; it was capable of in eight seconds. The subsequent 2109-91 five-door hatchback had the same VAZ-415 and gearbox.


There was also a rear-engined Samara 4x4 rally car, also known as the NAMI 0290, built for the 1985 Soyuz Rally; it had permanent four-wheel drive and a 1,568 cc Zhiguli-based engine, over the rear axle. It was nicknamed Appelsin (&quot;orange&quot;, for its paint), and used ZAZ-1102 doors (though the body was mostly fiberglass, weighing only ) and still using factory Samara wheels.

The 1987 mid-engined Samara-EVA had a turbocharged 16-valve 1,860 cc engine (with electronic fuel injection) of ; a naturally-aspirated version produced . The only component left untouched was the original Zhuguli 2106 block.

An even more powerful Samara S-Proto appeared in 1989, putting out . Most notably, the Samara T3 came seventh in class in the 1990 Paris-Dakar Rally and fifth in 1991, piloted by Jacky Ickx. The T3 did not contain many Samara parts however, using the Porsche 959&#x27;s four-wheel drive system and a 3.6-litre Porsche flat-six. It was developed by French concessionaire Lada-Poch together with NAMI and the Tupolev aircraft factory. In the mid-1980s Lada developed its first ever convertible car on its own, then actually entering production and quickly exported to most European countries, called the Lada Natasha Cabriolet, a four-seater convertible that was based on the popular Samara 1300/1500 models with a manual opening and closing canvas roof. Also in some European car markets the LADA Niva 4X4 1600 cc engine was also available for both the Lada Natasha and Lada Samara cars during the 1990s.
==Exports==

The Samara was sold all across the world, from Australia to Canada, in most European countries, and throughout the COMECON sphere. The build quality of the Samara was better than that of most Eastern European models. In most nations, versions and equipments were decided on and installed by the dealers themselves. These local varieties ranged from decals and badges to the convertible conversions offered in Belgium and Germany. The Samara was often sold under other names as well, in particular the VAZ 21099 (Samara Sedan), which was sold as the Sagona (France, Canada, and Spain), Diva (Belgium and the Netherlands), Forma (Germany) and Sable (Australia and New Zealand).

It was engineered in right-hand drive for the UK market, where it was sold from November 1987. It was sold there until VAZ withdrew from the UK market in July 1997, and was the most popular Lada model sold in the UK during the 23 years that the brand was sold there.

In certain markets where the tax structure benefited diesels (such as France and the Benelux), the Samara was available with a 1.5-litre Peugeot diesel engine in 1995–97.

With VAZ facing financial hardships in 1996–1997, exports began coming to a halt. The Lada Samara disappeared from Canada after the 1997 model year, leaving the Niva as the only Lada sold in Canada for the 1998 model year. Exports to Australia and Great Britain ended around the same time. The biggest problem was GM&#x27;s reluctance to sell the fuel-injection kits necessary for exports, as they doubted VAZ&#x27;s ability to pay. Faced with parts shortages, tax problems, and the chaos and criminality of Russia in the mid-nineties, export efforts languished and RHD production was no longer feasible.

As a partial response to this situation, a higher-quality version for the European market, the Lada EuroSamara or Samara Baltic in some markets, was assembled in Finland at the Valmet Automotive plant in Uusikaupunki. Production started in mid-1996 and ended in July 1998, with 14,000 cars made from 85 per cent Russian parts.

===British market===
The United Kingdom had to wait nearly three years for the Samara to go on sale, after its launch in the USSR, but sales were reasonably strong when the first versions of the car left forecourts, in November 1987.

In a road test conducted by &quot;The Motor&quot; magazine, it scored more than 5 points out of 10 in most aspects and was praised for having a remarkably extensive list of standard equipment, &quot;impressive&quot; engine, good visibility and performance for its price segment, lowered fuel consumption, being good at cornering and &quot;tolerably quiet&quot;, but also received criticism for having a cheap-looking interior and plastic mouldings and being &quot;very turbulent&quot; on poor roads.

The £4,795 price at introduction &quot;was much less expensive&quot; than the competing Peugeot 309 or Ford Escort 1300. The Samara remained on sale in the United Kingdom right up to 4 July 1997, when the decision was made to withdraw from Great Britain and most other export markets.
In countries where ruggedness was more important, it was more successful, selling reasonably well in Canada, Australia, and Finland for instance.

The attempt to appeal to a wider clientele failed; while an improvement over previous Ladas, the Samara&#x27;s higher price pitched it against stiffer West European competition.

By the time of the Samara&#x27;s launch, the British small family car market was effectively split into two segments: The large mainstream market was dominated by mass-market manufacturers, such as Ford, Vauxhall, and Volkswagen. The budget market consisted of Eastern European and Far Eastern brands, such as Škoda, FSO, Hyundai, and Proton.

The aging Samara came bottom of the annual 1996 and 1997 JD Power and Top Gear surveys in Great Britain.

====Versions====
Initially sold as a three- or five-door hatchback with a 1.3 petrol engine, a 1.5 version became available in October 1988. Metallic paint became an option for the first time in November 1989 when the 1.5 SLX was launched. A new entry-level model arrived in July 1990 when the 1.1 petrol engine was added to the range (Select or L). An updated version of the Samara was launched in April 1991, with all new trim levels. This was followed by the introduction of the VAZ 21099 saloon version 15 months later. The saloon also became available as a sporty 1.5 &quot;Juno&quot; from July 1994, featuring alloy wheels, swoopy, ill-fitting sideskirts and a rear spoiler. A fuel injected engine became available on the 1.3 and 1.5 models in August 1996.

===Australian market===

The Samara was introduced into the Australian market in July 1988, and was offered in three-door and convertible body styles. A three-door variant called the Bizivan was also offered, which was sold without rear seats in order to qualify as a commercial van, and therefore, lower import duties. In 1990, the range was pared down to a single five-door model, marketed as the Lada Cevaro. The 3-door returned in 1994 as the Lada Volante and the four-door was introduced as the Lada Sable. Imports had ceased by 1996.

In 1988, approximately 6,000 Lada Samaras were modified by Peter Brock&#x27;s Special Vehicles operation that had previously made high performance Holden Commodores. The cars would be known as the Lada Samara Sedan Brock Delux and included a few subtle Brock-devised suspension tweaks to improve the car&#x27;s low-speed ride, as well as a special body kit. It cost about A$3,000 more than the base model Samara.

==Samara 2==
After 1997, the Samara was mostly sold in its homeland only, although it was still sold in some foreign markets with less strict emissions regulations. The Samara 2, a lightly facelifted version with a , single-point fuel-injected version of the 1,499 cc engine and a better gearbox, went on sale in limited numbers as the 2115 (four-door sedan) in 1997. The 2115 was built at the VAZ special vehicles unit. Brakes and interior were also upgraded, incorporating parts from the VAZ 2110. Full production on the main line in Togliatti began in 2000, in 2002 a five-door (2114) was added and the 2113 three-door followed in September 2004. The three-door was not originally planned to be built, but was added as a response to strong dealer demand.

In late 2001, the 1500 engine was updated with multi-point fuel injection, enabling it to meet Euro 3 emissions regulations. The last first generation Samara rolled off the Togliatti production line in 2004, ending 20 years of production there. Production of the &quot;classic&quot; Samara 2109/21099 continued at ZAZ in Ukraine as of 2004, and from May 2007 in Kazakhstan by Azia Avto.

In January 2007, an upgraded Samara 2, using the modern 1.6-litre VAZ-11183-20 engine first seen in the VAZ 2110 went on sale. While the Lada 110 and the Lada Priora have taken much of the Samara&#x27;s market share at home, the Samara retains a clear price advantage and steady demand. The production of sedan Lada Samara 2 was stopped in December 2012; hatchbacks were still assembled until the end of 2013.

<doc id="72793" wikidata="Q11947" url="?curid=72793" title="Pete (Disney)">
<text>Pete (also named Peg Leg Pete, Bad Pete and Black Pete, among other names) is a cartoon character created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks of The Walt Disney Company. Pete is traditionally depicted as the villainous arch-nemesis of Mickey Mouse, and was made notorious for his repeated attempts to kidnap Minnie Mouse. Pete is the oldest continuing Disney character, having debuted in the cartoon &quot;Alice Solves the Puzzle&quot; in 1925. He originally bore the appearance of an anthropomorphic bear, but with the advent of Mickey in 1928, he was defined as a cat.

Pete appeared in 67 animated short films between 1925 and 1954, having been featured in the &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; and &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; cartoons, and later in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, &quot;Donald Duck&quot;, and &quot;Goofy&quot; cartoons. During World War II, he played the long-suffering sergeant trying to make a soldier out of Donald Duck in a series of animated shorts.

Pete&#x27;s final appearance during this era was &quot;The Lone Chipmunks&quot; (1954), which was the final installment of a three-part &quot;Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale&quot; series. He also appeared in the featurettes &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1990), the feature films &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995), &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; (2000), &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot; (1999), and &quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot; (2004), and the short film &quot;Get a Horse!&quot; (2013).

Pete has also made many appearances in Disney comics. He appeared as Sylvester Shyster&#x27;s dimwitted sidekick in the early &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strips before evolving into the main antagonist. In the Italian comics production he has been given a girlfriend, Trudy, and has come to be the central character in some stories. Pete later made several appearances in television, most extensively in &quot;Goof Troop&quot; (1992–1993) where he was given a different continuity, having a family and a regular job as a used car salesman and being a friend (albeit a poor one) to Goofy. He reprises this incarnation in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas.&quot; Pete also appears in &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001–2003) as the greedy property owner who is always trying to exploit devious ways and loopholes to get the club shut down.

Although Pete is often typecast as a villain, he has shown great versatility within the role, playing everything from a hardened criminal (&quot;The Dognapper&quot;, &quot;The Lone Chipmunks&quot; and most of his depictions in comics) to a legitimate authority figure (&quot;Moving Day&quot;, &quot;Donald Gets Drafted&quot;, &quot;Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip&quot;), and from a menacing trouble maker (&quot;Building a Building&quot;, &quot;Trombone Trouble&quot;) to a victim of mischief himself (&quot;Timber&quot;, &quot;The Vanishing Private&quot;). On some occasions, Pete has even played a sympathetic character, all the while maintaining his underlying menacing nature (&quot;Symphony Hour&quot;, &quot;How to Be a Detective&quot;). In the animated TV series &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;, which is aimed at preschoolers, he is largely a friendly character, although his antics can occasionally prove an annoyance.

==Theatrical cartoons==
===&quot;Alice Comedies&quot;===

Pete first appeared in the Walt Disney-produced 1920s &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; short subject series.

He first appeared in &quot;Alice Solves the Puzzle&quot; (February 15, 1925) as Bootleg Pete. His nickname was a reference to his career of bootlegging alcoholic beverages during Prohibition in the United States (1920-1933). In the cartoon, Pete&#x27;s activities bring him to a beach in time to see Alice working on a crossword puzzle. Pete happens to be a collector of crossword puzzles, and identifies Alice&#x27;s puzzle being a rare one missing from his collection. The rest of the short focuses on his antagonizing Alice and her drunk-on-moonshine cat Julius in order to steal it.

The menacing, peg-legged bear villain commanded quite a presence on the screen and was destined to return. In various later &quot;Alice Comedies&quot;, the character again battled and competed with Alice and Julius, often under the aliases Putrid Pete and Pegleg Pete.

===Oswald the Lucky Rabbit===

Disney needed a villain to place against his new star Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and Pete was introduced to his new adversary in the sixth Oswald short &quot;The Ocean Hop&quot; (September 8, 1927). Apparently inspired by Charles Lindbergh, the two enter an aeroplane race across the Atlantic Ocean. By the time producer Charles Mintz moved production of the Oswald series to his own studio, Pete had been established as the most consistently appearing supporting character to Oswald, and the character continued to appear in that role in the Oswald films directed and produced by Walter Lantz until 1937, making him essentially the only cartoon character at the time to frequently appear in shorts produced by two rival animation studios. His most notable non-Disney appearance was arguably as a captain in &quot;Permanent Wave&quot; (September 29, 1929).

===Mickey Mouse and friends===
After leaving the Oswald series, Disney and his team created a cat villain for their new protagonist Mickey Mouse. Originally unnamed in the cartoons and called &quot;Terrible Tom&quot; in a January 1930 comic strip, the villain was called Pegleg Pete by April 1930, formalizing him as a new incarnation of the pre-Mickey bad guy. Animator Norm Ferguson, known for developing Pluto, also developed Pete&#x27;s character in several shorts and he was made to resemble actor Wallace Beery.

Pete appeared as Mickey&#x27;s enemy beginning with the 1928 cartoons &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; and &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. While he was seen with two legs in those films, he first appeared with a peg-leg in 1930&#x27;s &quot;The Cactus Kid&quot; and would speak for the first time. He would first appear in color in &quot;Moving Day&quot; (1936), which would drop the peg-leg. In the cartoons of the 1930s, Pete would be Mickey Mouse&#x27;s nemesis, but would vary in professions, from an all-out outlaw (&quot;Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot;, &quot;The Cactus Kid&quot;, &quot;Two-Gun Mickey&quot;) to a brutal law-enforcer (&quot;Moving Day&quot;, where Pete is a sheriff who serves Mickey and Donald Duck with an eviction notice). On the other hand, in the 1942 cartoon &quot;Symphony Hour&quot;, Pete is a sympathetic impresario who sponsors Mickey&#x27;s orchestra in a concert, which goes terribly wrong but is a great success. As Mickey&#x27;s popularity declined, Pete would serve as an antagonist for Donald Duck and to a lesser extent Goofy and Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale. In the 1940s, Pete would play the role of Donald&#x27;s drill sergeant in several war-themed shorts (eg. &quot;Donald Gets Drafted&quot;, &quot;The Old Army Game&quot;) 

==Comics==
In Disney comics, Pete is consistently depicted as a professional criminal, who often teams up with Mickey Mouse enemies Sylvester Shyster, Eli Squinch, or the Phantom Blot.

In a promotional strip for the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip in early 1930, he was announced as &quot;Terrible Tom – The Vile Villain&quot;, but this name was never used afterwards. In the April 24, 1930 strip, Mickey refers to him as &quot;Pegleg Pete&quot;, and the name sticks. Pete first appeared in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip on April 21, 1930, in the story &quot;Mickey Mouse in Death Valley&quot;. This appearance is the first time since the &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; that Pete has a pegleg. Floyd Gottfredson occasionally committed goofs, with the pegleg switching from Pete&#x27;s right leg to his left one. In the August 26, 1930 strip, Pete&#x27;s peg swaps from right to left between one panel to the next. Pete&#x27;s pegleg also appears on the left in the July 11 strip, and for the week of September 3 to 9. In Gottfredson&#x27;s story &quot;The Mystery at Hidden River&quot; (1941–42), the pegleg disappeared, with Pete having two normal legs: when Mickey expressed surprise at this, Pete described one of his legs as a new, &quot;streamlined, modern&quot; artificial leg.

In 1944, Walt Disney decided to retire the character from the shorts; comics historian Alberto Becattini writes that this was &quot;partly because he was concerned that it seemed to be a case of mocking the afflicted, partly because the animators could never remember which leg was the wooden one.&quot; Pete also left the comic strip for a few years; his last appearance was in &quot;The World of Tomorrow&quot;, which ran from July to September 1944.

However, Pete continued to appear in the comic books – in 1945, he was the heavy in the Donald Duck comic &quot;Frozen Gold&quot; (&quot;Four Color&quot; #62, January 1945) and in Mickey&#x27;s &quot;The Riddle of the Red Hat&quot; (&quot;Four Color&quot; #79, August 1945). He surfaced again in a number of &quot;giveaway&quot; comics in 1946 and 1947 – &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Trees&quot; (&quot;Donald and Mickey Merry Christmas&quot;, 1946), &quot;Donald and the Pirates&quot; (Cheerios Premium #W1, 1947), &quot;Mickey Mouse and the Haunted House&quot; (Cheerios Premium #W4, 1947), &quot;Mickey Mouse at the Rodeo&quot; (Cheerios Premium #X4, 1947), &quot;Mickey Mouse&#x27;s Helicopter&quot; (&quot;Boys and Girls March of Comics Giveaway&quot; #8, 1947) – and came back to the comic books in &quot;Mickey Mouse and the Submarine Pirates&quot; (&quot;Four Color&quot; #141, March 1947).

With Pete still appearing in comic books, Gottfredson brought him back to the comic strip in &quot;Pegleg Pete Reforms&quot; (March 1947). His last appearance in the strip was in &quot;The Isle of Moola-La&quot; (April–October 1952). From then on, he made many more appearances in the comic books.

In &quot;Mickey Mouse in Death Valley&quot; and in several subsequent storylines, Pete was portrayed as Sylvester Shyster&#x27;s henchman. From 1934, he gradually started to work on his own. Sometimes, Pete also teams up with other bad guys in the Disney universe, such as Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s enemies (the Beagle Boys and Magica De Spell), Mad Madam Mim, Captain Hook, and the Evil Queen. In various comics stories, his right-hand man is a skinny, bearded criminal named Scuttle. In Italian comics, his girlfriend Trudy (Trudy Van Tubb) is his frequent partner-in-crime. His cousin the &quot;mad scientist&quot; Portis is another, less frequent, accomplice.

In the 1943 comic strip story &quot;Mickey Mouse on a Secret Mission&quot;, he was an agent of Nazi Germany, working as the henchman of Gestapo spy Von Weasel. In the 1950 comic strip story &quot;The Moook Treasure&quot;, he is even portrayed as the Beria-like deputy chief of intelligence in a totalitarian state on the other side of the Iron Curtain.

His name in Italy has remained &quot;Pietro Gambadilegno&quot; (&quot;Pegleg Peter&quot;), or simply &quot;Gambadilegno&quot; (&quot;Pegleg&quot;) even though it has been a long time since he was actually depicted with a pegleg in either comics or animated cartoons. In an Italian story by Romano Scarpa, &quot;Topolino e la dimensione Delta&quot; (&quot;Mickey Mouse and the Delta Dimension&quot;, first published in 1959), Pete briefly removes his artificial leg, revealing his old foot-high pegleg underneath. Usually, Gambadilegno is depicted as the antagonist of Chief Seamus O&#x27;Hara (&quot;commissario Adamo Basettoni&quot;) and Detective Casey (&quot;ispettore Manetta&quot;) and is either a rival or a partner-in-crime of the Phantom Blot (&quot;Macchia Nera&quot;).

Pete returned in the 2013 short &quot;Get a Horse!&quot;, and was animated as having a peg left leg.

==World War II==

During World War II, Pete was &quot;drafted&quot; by Walt Disney and appeared as the official mascot of the United States Merchant Marine. He appeared in Donald Duck&#x27;s series of army films where he plays Donald&#x27;s Drill Sergeant and later Sergeant and Jumpmaster. In the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip, he was a spy for Nazi Germany in the episode &quot;Mickey Mouse on a Secret Mission&quot; (1943), his motivation being the money.

==Ancestry and family==

Comic book stories have depicted Pete as being descended from a long line of villains, highwaymen and outlaws. Even historical figures such as Attila the Hun, Blackbeard, Antonio López de Santa Anna, Billy The Kid, and Cao Cao have been included among his ancestors. His mother is known only as Maw Pete and was mentioned in the story &quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold&quot; by Carl Barks and Jack Hannah (first published October 1942) as a resident of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her only appearance was in &quot;The River Pirates&quot; (&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #336–338, published September–November 1968) by Carl Fallberg and Paul Murry. The same story introduced Li&#x27;l Pete, Black Pete&#x27;s short fraternal twin brother. In December 1998, the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip introduced an older sister of Pete. Petula is the television host of the cooking show &quot;Petula&#x27;s Pantry&quot;. She finds time, however, to seek revenge against Mickey for condemning her &quot;baby brother&quot; to life imprisonment. Pete&#x27;s twin brother, named Zeke appears in &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, by Carl Fallberg and Paul Murry.

Better-known and more enduring as characters are two figures created by Romano Scarpa for Italian Disney comics. The first, Trudy Van Tubb, was introduced in (published in English as &quot;The Chirikawa Necklace&quot;, first published on March 10, 1960). This female partner of Pete was presented as a childhood acquaintance of his: they are even shown as kids kidnapping Mickey when he was a baby. However, Trudy soon became Pete&#x27;s girlfriend, his partner-in-crime and roommate—whenever they hold residence out of prison, that is. Their relationship seems to have evolved to a long-standing common-law marriage. This is occasionally used in contrast to Mickey&#x27;s eternal engagement to Minnie Mouse and Goofy&#x27;s determination to remain a bachelor. Trudy and Pete also have two hellion nephews named Pierino and Pieretto who often serve as foils for Mickey or Mickey&#x27;s nephews Morty and Ferdie.

The second character to be created by Scarpa is Pete&#x27;s cousin, the criminal scientist Portis (Plottigat in the original Italian version; English name first used in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; 695, 2008). Portis first appeared in (published in English as &quot;The Weregoof&#x27;s Curse&quot;; January 9, 1977).

Ed Nofziger is responsible for a third recurring character, an alternative girlfriend of Pete named Chirpy Bird. She first appeared in (&quot;Mickey Mouse and the Pigeon Police&quot;, first published in December 1981) and starred as Pete&#x27;s partner-in-crime in eight stories from 1981 to 1984. In France, she and Trudy are presented as the same character, being both renamed Gertrude, despite Trudy being a cat and Chirpy being a canary.

In &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, Pete has another cousin named Zeke. Zeke is a criminal like Pete, but is wary of his cousin&#x27;s attempts to double-cross him &quot;Just like old Times&quot;. Mickey often uses this distrust to turn the two against one-another.

In &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, Pete has a wife, Peg, and two children, PJ and Pistol. Alternatively, the comic book story &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Strange Mission&quot; from &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics &amp; Stories&quot; #245 (1961, by Carl Fallberg and Paul Murry) suggests a cultured ancestry for Pete, giving his full name as the genteel Percy P. Percival.

In &quot;Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures&quot;, Pete has a nephew named Jimbo, who is voiced by Fred Stoller.

In the Italian comic story of 1998, (&quot;Mickey Mouse and Aunt Melinda&#x27;s diary&quot;), Pete&#x27;s grandma appears, depicted as the only honest member of his family.

==Television==
===&quot;DuckTales&quot;===
In the first season of the 1987 TV series &quot;DuckTales&quot;, Pete appeared in a few episodes. However, he was portrayed as a different character in each of his appearances. Because of this, he was not always a true villain, but sometimes just a selfish individual with no evil agenda. In a few episodes, he even makes peace with Scrooge&#x27;s group in the end. The various Petes appear to be their own characters, as two of them lived in different time periods, and because Scrooge never &quot;recognizes&quot; him, despite any previous encounters he may have had with any of the other Petes. In all of his appearances Pete was voiced by Will Ryan.
===&quot;Goof Troop&quot;===
In the 1992 TV series &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, Pete has a family who includes his wife Peg, their two children Pete Junior (or PJ for short) and Pistol, and their dog Chainsaw with Pete taking on a more canine-like appearance. They live next door to Goofy (who went to high school with Pete) and his son Max. In the series, Pete is often the victim of Goofy&#x27;s clumsiness and mishaps, usually resulting in the destruction of his property or great personal injury. Pete owns a used-car dealership, and though no longer openly villainous, is still conniving (as well as abrasive, obnoxious, truculent and suspicious) and often exploits his good-hearted and somewhat addled friend Goofy. Often, his schemes backfire, or he feels guilty about his oafish behavior and works to set things right. His wife Peg often attempts to rid Pete of his uncouth attitude, and his son PJ is a complete opposite of his father in behavior, as he is good friends with Goofy&#x27;s son Max in the series and its spin-off movies &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995) and &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; (2000). Jim Cummings provided Pete&#x27;s booming bass voice starting from that series, and to date is still the character&#x27;s voice in all media. It is eventually revealed in the series&#x27; pilot episode &quot;Forever Goof&quot; that one of the reasons why Pete dislikes Goofy so much is that when Pete was a high school quarterback in a big football game, it was Goofy who accidentally caused Pete to fumble the ball and lose the game by hitting him in the face with a pom pom (Goofy was on the cheerleading squad).

===&quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;===
After &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, Pete reverted to his evil ways on &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, where he frequently bullied the other characters and occasionally kidnapped Minnie Mouse. He would also play an average criminal (i.e. a house burglar). Then in &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, he plays the role of the evil landlord. Several episodes involved his attempts to close the club by sabotaging the show, though there were times when he helped out the crew.

===&quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;===
Pete appears in numerous episodes of &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;. He maintains his protagonist and semi-antagonist role, but is significantly toned down for its preschool audience—he is less malicious and more mischievous. Viewers will find that Mickey and gang are very forgiving of Pete and his escapades. He often appears as a seller of objects the gang needs, and will give them an item in exchange for beans. He is much nicer than his previous incarnations—in one episode, he invites the group to a Halloween party; in &quot;Pete&#x27;s Beach Blanket Luau&quot;, he even invites everyone to the titular party.

While &quot;Clubhouse&quot; has a great deal of fun at Pete&#x27;s expense (or &quot;expanse&quot;, as he is the biggest and fattest character; they use his overalls for a sail in &quot;Mickey and Minnie&#x27;s Jungle Safari&quot;), it also depicts him in a sympathetic light; he is openly sentimental in &quot;Clarabelle&#x27;s Clubhouse Carnival&quot;, not wanting to part with his &quot;Petey doll&quot; prizes. He even changes Baby Goofy&#x27;s diaper (willingly) in &quot;Goofy Baby&quot;.

The &quot;Carnival&quot; episode also gives us the closest approximation of Pete&#x27;s weight; he is shown to be the same size and weight as Humphrey the Bear.

In &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Great Clubhouse Hunt&quot;, he is the only character not invited to the Easter Egg Hunt (or so he thinks), so he tries to gatecrash, but messes up the secret word, causing the clubhouse to float away. At the end, he apologizes and is invited to the egg hunt after all. He is also revealed as the owner of Butch the Bulldog, who is friends with Mickey&#x27;s dog, Pluto.

===&quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot;===
Pete also appears in &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot; as a recurring character, either competing against Mickey and friends in races or as a civilian in various locales. The series also features various alter egos/relatives of Pete:

*Piston Piedro in &quot;Race for the Rigatoni Ribbon&quot;
*El Toro Pete in &quot;Running of the Roadsters?&quot;
*Sir Lord Pete in &quot;Ye Olde Royal Heist&quot;
*Beefeater Pete in &quot;Tea Time Trouble!&quot;
*Captain Peterson in &quot;The Happiest Helpers Cruise!&quot;
*Peteroni Leone in &quot;Lights, Camera, Help!&quot;

===&quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; &amp; &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot;===
Pete appears in the 2013 &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; cartoon series, and its 2020 spin-off &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot;. In both shows, he is designed based on his appearances in the early Mickey Mouse cartoons, complete with a peg-leg. Like &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, he has reverted to his evil ways, and again his booming bass voice is provided by Jim Cummings.

==Feature films and featurettes==
===&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;===
In the 1983 short film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; featuring Disney characters, Pete was cast as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, who reveals himself by removing his hood and lighting a cigar, which also lights up the engraving on Scrooge&#x27;s grave, and having only one line (&quot;Why &quot;yours&quot;, Ebenezer. The richest man in the cemetery!&quot;, in response to Scrooge&#x27;s question about whose grave it was) and laughing cruelly while Scrooge struggles to escape from his open grave as the gates of Hell are opening.

===&quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;===
In this Disney version of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, Pete once again played as the primary villain, this time as the English king&#x27;s captain of the guard. When he saw that his ruler&#x27;s life was slowly diminishing, he and his henchmen, a band of anthropomorphic weasels (from &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;) who now act as the king&#x27;s guards, seized the opportunity to terrorize England&#x27;s citizens and rob them of their goods in &quot;favor&quot; of the king. After kicking out a disguised Prince, whom he mistook for the peasant boy Mickey Mouse, out of his kingdom, he later receives word from one of his guards that the Prince was seen a causing a commotion in the village, as the guard claimed that he &quot;acted like a nobleman and he had the royal ring!&quot; Pete suddenly realizes that it was indeed the Prince he &quot;booted out&quot; and seizes another opportunity out of this. That night, after the king passes away, Pete finds the &quot;phony prince&quot; (Mickey), threatening the life of his dog, Pluto, unless Mickey follows his commands. In the village, he soon finds and captures the real Prince and takes him to the castle&#x27;s dungeon to lock him up. On the day of the Prince&#x27;s coronation, Pete plots to get Mickey crowned as king, though Mickey is still subservient to Pete&#x27;s orders. His plan, however, is thwarted when the Prince suddenly appears in the throne room, having busted out of the dungeon and evading the guards with the help of Goofy (Mickey&#x27;s peasant friend) and Donald Duck (the Prince&#x27;s valet). A sudden battle in the throne room (Mickey and the Prince vs. Pete; Goofy and Donald vs. the Weasel Guards) results in Pete&#x27;s defeat, as Goofy&#x27;s bumbling antics cause a chandelier to fall on the weasels, bundle them together, and send them rolling towards Pete. Pete, seeing this, tries to flee but is slowed down by his ripped-down pants (courtesy of the Prince&#x27;s swashbuckling skills) and tripped by both the Prince and Mickey, causing him to get rolled over and caught on the chandelier, which sends him and his men rolling through a stained glass window and falling out of the castle.

===&quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; and &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;===
Pete later appeared in &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; and its sequel where he was still snooty and somewhat cankerous at times; despite this, he is shown in a much lighter tone as these movies are based on &quot;Goof Troop&quot;. He is Goofy&#x27;s best friend and always confidant in the films.

===&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot;===
In the 1999 direct-to-video film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot; Pete appears in the story &quot;A Very Goofy Christmas&quot; as Goofy&#x27;s neighbor, being responsible for making Max stop believing in Santa Claus by telling him that his existence is impossible. Later he appears in the story &quot;Mickey and Minnie&#x27;s Gift of the Magi&quot; as Mickey&#x27;s boss selling Christmas trees.

===&quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;===
In the 2004 made-for-video animated film &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (with Mickey, Donald Duck, and Goofy playing the title roles), Pete again appeared under the name Peg-Leg Pete. He served as the main antagonist of the film. Here, he was the Captain of the Musketeers, aiming to take over France, with the help of his lieutenant, Clarabelle Cow, and the Beagle Boys. To do so, he must get Princess Minnie out of the way, but it proves to be difficult for him, even when he hires the film&#x27;s titular trio to be her bodyguards, believing they will not do a good job protecting her. He received his own &quot;bad guy song&quot;, using the classic music piece &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot;.

===Other film appearances===
Pete also made a non-speaking cameo appearance as a Toontown police officer in the very final scene of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;; he is viewed from the back, alongside Tom and Jerry&#x27;s Spike and Horace Horsecollar in security uniforms, just before Porky Pig and Tinker Bell close the movie.

Although Pete does not appear in the 1995 &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; short &quot;Runaway Brain&quot;, the short&#x27;s main antagonist, Julius, heavily bears his likeness. He is also voiced by Jim Cummings and has a peg leg, and when Mickey is trapped in his body he gains Pete&#x27;s signature buck teeth to boot.

In the 2002 direct-to-video film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s House of Villains&quot;, Pete and other Disney villains&#x27; guest appearances from &quot;House of Mouse&quot; are featured. He takes part in the musical number &quot;It&#x27;s Our House Now&quot; when villains take over the club.

Pete makes a cameo appearance in the 2022 film &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, where he is seen riding the Magic Carpet and dressed as Prince Ali from the 1992 version of &quot;Aladdin&quot; while filming a bootleg movie of it.

==Video game appearances==
* In the early Game Boy game &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Dangerous Chase&quot;, Mickey has a present for Minnie, but Pete steals it. To get it back, Mickey must chase him through several different zones. Pete is the final (and only) boss of the game.
* Pete appears as the captain of a pirate ship in the early NES Capcom game &quot;Mickey Mousecapade&quot; (or simply Mickey Mouse). Unlike most appearances, he is not the final boss in this game. Notably, his role here was exclusive to the game&#x27;s American release; in the original Japanese version, the level&#x27;s boss was Captain Hook from &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.
* In &quot;Adventures in the Magic Kingdom&quot; for the NES, Pete (referred to as &quot;Panhandle Pete&quot;) steals one of the keys needed to unlock the castle and challenges your character to a race on the Autopia attraction to get it back. Pete is only depicted in cut scenes, with the &quot;race&quot; itself more of a timed obstacle course featuring other cars with indistinct drivers.
* In &quot;Disney&#x27;s Magical Quest&quot;, a trilogy by Capcom, Pete is the final boss of each game, personating a distinct ruler (Emperor, Baron and King). He serves as an evil ruler who terrorizes the land he reigns and often kidnaps another character. In &quot;Disney&#x27;s Magical Quest 1&quot;, he kidnaps Pluto; in &quot;Disney&#x27;s Magical Quest 2&quot;, he appears as the tyrant &quot;Baron Pete&quot; who commands the game&#x27;s enemies; in &quot;Magical Quest 3&quot;, he kidnaps Donald&#x27;s nephews. Mickey and, depending on the game, Minnie or Donald, are always set to defeat him. In the end of the first game he simply disappears when he is defeated. In the second game, he is sealed inside his own crystal ball which Mickey throws into the distance. In &quot;Magical Quest 3&quot;, however, after being defeated by Mickey and Donald, he eventually surrenders and promises to become a good person.
* &quot;Quackshot&quot; follows the adventures of Donald Duck as he, with the aid of his three nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie, sets out to obtain some treasure from a map he found. Pete appears as an antagonist near the end of the game, kidnapping Donald&#x27;s nephews and demanding to be given the map, and must be fought immediately prior to the final stage and boss of the game.
* &quot;Mickey Mania&quot; follows Mickey Mouse, who has been catapulted back in time to his earliest appearance in &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. Black Pete is Mickey&#x27;s archvillain throughout the entire game, all the way from his very first confrontation against Mickey in Steamboat Willie all the way to his role in then-recent 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;.
* In the racing game &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Speedway USA&quot;, Pete is a heavyweight racer, but gets replaced when the players selects between Ludwig Von Drake or Huey, Dewey and Louie.
* Pete appears as the main antagonist in &quot;Magical Tetris Challenge&quot;. In the game, his goal is to obtain ultimate power from Donald&#x27;s mysterious purple stone, having a Weasel and the Big Bad Wolf as his henchmen.
* In &quot;Disney Think Fast&quot;, Pete appears as the final secret playable character after the player collects 30,000 points in a simple game.
* Pete is the final boss in &quot;World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck&quot;, a character who owns a giant magical box and sets the challenge to any victims who fall into it to traverse surreal terrains and then to defeat him for escape. Some of the minor enemies may look a little bit like Pete as well (such as the spiders). It all seems to be fun and games rather than true imprisonment, as in both Mickey&#x27;s and Donald&#x27;s final stage act before the credits, Pete can be seen in the audience enjoying the show with a mischievous grin on his face (Mickey and Donald nearly missed the show by falling into the box).
* In &quot;Legend of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse&quot;, Pete is incompetent king of the story, who passes his kingship to the laundry boy, Mickey and eventually fights him as a final boss to regain his throne.
* Pete appears as the main antagonist in &quot;Goofy&#x27;s Hysterical History Tour&quot;. In the game, he is janitor in Ludwig Von Drake&#x27;s museum and he wants to get his co-worker Goofy fired from job and sabotages the exhibits and scatters pieces throughout various time periods. Pete is the boss of each levels.
* Pete is featured in the Wii game, &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;. Once again with his titular peg-leg, he first appears in the Gremlin Village as Small Pete (based on It&#x27;s a Small World ride at Disneyland), he appears dressed as one of the Dutch girl dolls of the ride. He later appears as his usual self in Mean Street (based on Main Street USA), where he informs Mickey that there are many other Petes throughout the world, each themed differently depending on the zone in the game, like appearing in a Sark outfit in Tomorrow City as Petetronic and in Ventureland as Pete Pan. Pete himself (referred to as &quot;Big Bad Pete&quot;) acts as a self-appointed enforcer of sorts at Mean Street and is often a source of quests for the player. In Tomorrow City, which is inspired by Tomorrowland, the Sark-esque Petetronic is the boss of the level, attacking with thrown buckets of thinner, shaking the ground, and throwing his ID disk. The only way to attack Petetronic is to deflect his disk back at him which will stun him and expose his back side. Mickey can then squirt him with paint, which turns him blue and friendly, or thinner, which short-circuits him and reduces him to a MCP-like entity. In Ventureland, Pete appears as a jolly, bubbly version of himself known as &quot;Pete Pan&quot;, named after Peter Pan, who is trapped on Skull Island until Mickey can manage to save the sprite so Pete Pan can fight off the robot version of Captain Hook like he used to. The Petes return in the sequel, &quot;Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two&quot;, initially appearing as allies to the protagonists (except Pete Pan, who has allied with the Mad Doctor after Hook disappeared), Mickey and Oswald. However, by the end of the game, they leave with Prescott, presumably having plans for him. In the 3DS title &quot;Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion&quot;, three types of Pete enemies appear. The first type are Thwomp-like enemies with Pete&#x27;s face emblazoned on it. Mickey can use this enemy to his advantage by using a sketch of it. The second type resembles his appearance in the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. This time, Pete uses brute strength in order to fight Mickey. The third and final type uses a spiked shell to attack Mickey. Mickey can only defeat him by using a spin attack and then a jump attack.
* Pete is featured (with an appearance like the one in &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;) in the Nintendo 3DS game &quot;Disney Magical World&quot; as a character in the main city of Castleton. One of the 100 stickers required to complete the game requires the player to fulfill a request made by Pete, which results in an in-game photo of the player alongside Pete.
* Pete is a playable character in the mobile game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;. Before being unlocked, he is the first enemy boss in the game&#x27;s main storyline. In the game he appears with his appearance from the film &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, also having a costume available to be created with his appearance from the short film &quot;Get a Horse!&quot;

===&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series===

Pete is depicted as a recurring villain within the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series. He was originally a steamboat captain, with Mickey Mouse as his deck hand (as they were seen in &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;), and later the captain of the Royal Musketeers until his plans for a coup were foiled by Mickey (as they were seen in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;). After Disney Castle was built in their world, with Mickey its new king, Pete began causing all sorts of mischief until he was banished to another dimension. He was subsequently freed by Maleficent, to whom he became indebted, and vowed to amass an army of Heartless, creatures born from the darkness of people&#x27;s hearts, to return the favor.

* Prior to his service under Maleficent, Pete runs rampant through Disney Town during the world&#x27;s annually held Dream Festival, entering contests while shifting between two different alter egos—superhero &quot;Captain Justice&quot; and antihero &quot;Captain Dark&quot;—in an attempt to claim the &quot;Million Dreams Award&quot; for himself. He instead loses to one of the game&#x27;s three protagonists and player characters: Terra, Aqua, and Ventus. Since his lack of consideration for the hearts of others is made apparent through his mischief, Pete is banished to another dimension by Queen Minnie until he can learn to behave. He is released from his imprisonment by Maleficent, however, and helps her conquer the various worlds in the series&#x27; universe in return.
* Pete makes several appearances in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot;, where he is gathering Heartless to build an army of Heartless for Maleficent. He is first seen exploring Agrabah in search of Jafar&#x27;s magic lamp, but is secretly followed by Roxas and Axel of Organization XIII, who are on a mission to collect hearts. Pete eventually uncovers a secret passage leading outside the city, inadvertently leading Roxas to the Cave of Wonders. Roxas later returns with Xion to investigate the cave, but are spotted by Pete, who assumes they had come to take the lamp for themselves and fights them. After Pete is defeated, he makes a getaway. Pete reappears in Never Land where he plants several empty treasure chests across the island and sells maps leading to them to Captain Hook, knowing his greed will attract the Heartless for him to collect. However, his plans are once again foiled when Roxas slays the Heartless to collect their hearts. Pete decides to kill two birds with one stone by leading Hook to a final, gold-filled chest, which reacts to the darkness in Hook&#x27;s heart and becomes a powerful Heartless that Pete hopes will defeat Roxas, though it ends up being defeated instead. Pete disappears again, vowing revenge against Roxas if they ever meet again.
* Pete makes his first appearance in the series in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, where he first encounters the main group of protagonists—Sora, Donald, and Goofy—in front of Yen Sid&#x27;s tower, and is disappointed to learn that they had previously defeated Maleficent while he was out gathering Heartless (though he does contemplate taking her place in her absence). However, Maleficent is quickly resurrected, and Pete continues his duties after updating her on what occurred in her absence, traveling to other worlds to recruit old or new villains to either join (or rejoin) their cause, or to turn them into powerful Heartless, but is foiled by Sora and co. each time. Pete is viewed more as a nuisance than a threat by the heroes, Sora remarking that he is &quot;not smart enough to tie his own shoes&quot;. He is nonetheless fought as a recurring boss during several portions of the game, though the strategy for beating him is different each time. Pete often incurs Maleficent&#x27;s relentless annoyance and insults for his comical ineptness, despite his fierce loyalty to her. After one such incident, his yearning for going back in time to experience his wonder years as a steamboat captain again summons a portal to the past, which gives him the opportunity to put himself back in Maleficent&#x27;s good graces. He goes back in time to steal his younger self&#x27;s steamboat and alter the past to Maleficent&#x27;s liking, but is defeated again by Sora and co., who have allied themselves with the younger Pete (who never discovers the older Pete&#x27;s identity). However, Pete once again proves his worth when he brings Maleficent to the Castle That Never Was, the headquarters of Organization XIII, for them to use as a new base of operations, though he is very much aware that the Heartless will be unruly in this dark realm. In the end, he contemplates running when the castle becomes overrun with Heartless, but decides to stand by Maleficent&#x27;s side to hold them off and help Sora and his friends defeat Organization XIII, though the castle is destroyed. Before the final boss of the game, Pete can be fought again as a boss within the optional Hades Paradox Cup in Olympus Coliseum.
* Pete returns in &quot;Kingdom Hearts Coded&quot; to spy on Mickey in Disney Castle, and ends up being transported into the Datascape with the King. Helping Maleficent&#x27;s scheme to take over the virtual world, Pete encounters the Data Sora while helping Data Jafar and later kidnaps Data Riku, turning him into his slave through the bugs. He is later confronted at Hollow Bastion, unintentionally helping Data Sora regain his Keyblade before sicing Data Riku on him. Later, Data Sora attempts to rescue him and Maleficent from digital incarnation of Sora&#x27;s Heartless before it crushes them. However, Data Riku is able to rescue them through a &quot;rift in the data&quot; and escort the villains back to their world.
* In &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot;, because of the increasing Darkness through the worlds brought on by the eventual revival of Master Xehanort, Pete manages to bypass the protective magic of the Cornerstone of Light with Maleficent. They take Minnie hostage and send a letter to King Mickey, bringing them to a confrontation in the library of the castle. After Maleficent explains her past meeting with Xehanort, they demand the Data Worlds be handed over to them. However, Pete loses Minnie when Lea arrives and scares him with a chakram. He promptly flees with his boss. Sora and Riku also battle another past incarnation of Pete, this time during his career as the corrupt captain of Princess Minnie&#x27;s Royal Musketeers. He schemes to overthrow Minnie and become King himself, but his plans are foiled by the three Musketeers, Mickey, Donald and Goofy, with aid from Sora and Riku.
* Pete returns in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; along with Maleficent, but with a minor role. He is mainly seen aiding Maleficent in seeking out the mysterious black box left behind by the Keyblade Master Luxu, but to little success. In the game&#x27;s ending, Pete and Maleficent are seen spying on the encounter between Luxu (in his Xigbar form), Ira, Aced, Invi and Gula, where the black box is present.

<text>Samara, formerly known as Kuybyshev during Soviet rule, is the largest city and administrative centre of Samara Oblast in Russia. The city is located at the confluence of the Volga and the Samara rivers, with a population of over 1.14 million residents, up to 1.22 million residents in the urban agglomeration, not including Novokuybyshevsk, which is not conurbated. The city covers an area of , and is the eighth-largest city in Russia and tenth agglomeration, the third-most populous city on the Volga, as well as the Volga Federal District.

Formerly a closed city, Samara is now a large and important social, political, economic, industrial, and cultural centre in Russia and hosted the European Union—Russia Summit in May 2007. It has a continental climate characterised by hot summers and cold winters. The life of Samara&#x27;s citizens has always been intrinsically linked to the Volga River, which has not only served as the main commercial thoroughfare of Russia throughout several centuries, but also has great visual appeal. Samara&#x27;s riverfront is one of the main recreation sites for both local citizens and tourists.

==Etymology==
* Current name: Samara, ), ;
* Former name: Kuybyshev, ; 

Samara is named after the Samara River, which probably means &quot;summer water&quot; (signifying that it froze in winter) in the Indo-Iranian language which was spoken there around the third millennium BC. The Samara city gives its name to the Samara culture, a neolithic culture of the fifth millennium BC, and the Kurgan hypothesis associates the region with the original homeland (urheimat) of the Proto-Indo-European language.

During Soviet times, the city of Samara was renamed to Kuybyshev in 1935 in honor of the Russian Bolshevik, Valerian Kuybyshev. The city reverted to its historical name of Samara on 25 January 1991 where it remains to this day.

==History==
===Early history===
Samara, together with its northern neighbour Kazan, is at the centre of the Idel-Ural historical region. Ahmad ibn Fadlan visited the area that is now Samara around 921 while on his journey to the Volga Bulgars who then controlled the region from their capital Bolghar.

Legend has it that Alexius, Metropolitan of Kiev, later patron saint of Samara, visited the site of the city in 1357 and predicted that a great town would be erected there, and that the town would never be ravaged. The Volga port of Samara appears on Italian maps of the 14th century. Before 1586, the Samara Bend was a pirate nest. Lookouts would spot an oncoming boat and quickly cross to the other side of the peninsula so that the pirates could organize an attack. Officially, Samara started with a fortress built in 1586 at the confluence of the Volga and Samara Rivers. This fortress was a frontier post protecting the then easternmost boundaries of Russia from forays of nomads. A local customs office was established in 1600.

As more and more ships pulled into Samara&#x27;s port, the town turned into a centre for diplomatic and economic links between Russia and the East. Samara also opened its gates to peasant war rebels headed by Stepan Razin and Yemelyan Pugachyov, welcoming them with traditional bread and salt. The town was visited by Peter the Great and later Tsars.

In 1780, Samara was turned into an uyezd town of Simbirsk Governorate overseen by the local Governor-General, and Uyezd and Zemstvo Courts of Justice and a Board of Treasury were established. On January 1, 1851, Samara became the centre of Samara Governorate with an estimated population of 20,000. This gave a stimulus to the development of the economic, political and cultural life of the community. Samara was outside of the Pale of Settlement and as such did not have any significant Jewish population until the late 19th century. In 1877, during the Russian-Turkish War, a mission from the Samara City Duma led by Petr Alabin, as a symbol of spiritual solidarity, brought a banner tailored in Samara pierced with bullets and saturated with the blood of both Russians and Bulgarians, to Bulgaria, which has become a symbol of Russian-Bulgarian friendship.

===Soviet period===

In 1935, Samara was renamed Kuybyshev in honour of the Bolshevik leader Valerian Kuybyshev.

During World War II, Kuybyshev was chosen to be the alternative capital of the Soviet Union should Moscow fall to the invading Germans. In October 1941, the Communist Party and governmental organisations, diplomatic missions of foreign countries, leading cultural establishments and their staff were evacuated to the city. This decision was reversed in the summer of 1943. A dugout for Joseph Stalin known as &quot;Stalin&#x27;s Bunker&quot; was constructed but never used. To mark its role as wartime national capital a special Revolution Day parade was held at the city&#x27;s Kuybyshev Square on November 7, 1941, and since 2011 has been remembered in an annual military parade organised by the city government.

As a leading industrial centre, Kuybyshev played a major role in arming the country. From the very first months of World War II the city supplied the front with aircraft, firearms, and ammunition. Health centres and most of the city&#x27;s hospital facilities were turned into base hospitals. Polish and Czechoslovakian military units were formed on the territory of the Volga Military District. Samara&#x27;s citizens also fought at the front, many of them volunteers.

After the war the defence industry developed rapidly in Kuybyshev; existing facilities changed their profile and new factories were built, leading to Kuybyshev becoming a closed city. In 1960, Kuybyshev became the missile shield centre for the country. The launch vehicle Vostok, which delivered the first crewed spaceship to orbit, was built at the Samara Progress Plant. Yuri Gagarin, the first man to travel in space on April 12, 1961, took a rest in Kuybyshev after returning to Earth. While there, he spoke to an improvised meeting of Progress workers. Kuybyshev enterprises played a leading role in the development of Soviet domestic aviation and the implementation of the Soviet space program. There is also an unusual monument situated in Samara commemorating an Ilyushin Il-2 ground-attack aircraft assembled by Kuybyshev workers in late 1942. This particular plane was shot down in 1943 over Karelia, but the heavily wounded pilot, K. Kotlyarovsky, managed to crash-land the plane near Lake Oriyarvi. The aircraft was returned to Kuybyshev in 1975, and was placed on display at the intersection of two major roads as a symbol of the deeds of home front servicemen and air-force pilots during the Great Patriotic War.

===Post-Soviet period===
In January 1991, the historical name of Samara was given back to the city. Samara is one of the major industrial cities of Russia and has a multiethnic population. The city retains its leading positions in the region, mainly due to a number of oil and petrochemical enterprises. In September 2016, Samara was awarded the title &quot;City of Labor and Combat Glory&quot;.

In 2018, Samara became one of the host cities of the FIFA World Cup, the matches of which were held at the Samara Arena stadium.

On July 2, 2020, the title &quot;City of Labor Valor&quot; was awarded to Samara. On December 10, 2021, the Memorial Complex was installed on the Alley of Labor Glory on the Young Pioneers Avenue. The central element of the memorial complex was a glass and metal stele about 26 meters high.

==Geography==
===Urban layout===
The development of the territory of modern Samara began in the 16th century with the foundation of the Samara fortress. Prior to the founding of the fortress, this area was home to piers for Volga ships. The official date of foundation of the settlement was the decree of Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich of 1586. The location of the town was predetermined by several factors: strategic placement in order to ensure security from the raids of nomadic tribes; expansion of the Russian state in the Middle and Lower Volga regions; convenient location in the steppe landscape, at the intersection of the Volga and Samarka rivers.

The fortress was wooden with 11 towers, surrounded by a rampart and a moat, and occupied 5.2 hectares. Gradually, the population of the fortress increased, and the surrounding territories were developed. Simultaneously with the fortress in 1586, Boldyrskaya Sloboda arose on the Volga slope, and around 1645, upstream the Volga, Voznesenskaya Sloboda. During the 17th century, the settlements merged into a single whole.

In 1688, the settlement received the status of a city, which required the development of the first boundary plan. It is known that by the beginning of the 18th century the city stretched in a narrow strip along the Volga slope. From 1703 to 1706, a new earthen, diamond-shaped form was built to the east of the old fortress. The layout was unsystematic, with small blocks of bizarre shapes. Almost the entire territory was occupied by residential buildings and administrative, commercial and military buildings were concentrated only in the fortress. The territories along the banks of the Volga and Samarka were occupied by marinas and barns. By 1717, there were 210 philistine houses and 17 houses of yasak peasants in Samara. The settlement grew slowly due to its border position and by the end of the 18th century it occupied 61.2 hectares of territory, compactly stretching along the banks of the Volga.
In 1763, Empress Catherine II signed an order &quot;On the making of all cities, their buildings and streets of special plans for each province especially.&quot; In the 70s, extensive activities were launched by the “Commission on the Stone Buildings of St. Petersburg and Moscow” to rebuild provincial cities. At the same time, the development of the first master plan for Samara began. In 1764, the settlement changed its administrative status, becoming a settlement. In 1780 it again received the status of a county town. In 1765 and 1772 it was badly damaged by fires. Despite these obstacles, in 1782 Samara received the first master plan with a rectangular grid of streets.
According to the plan, the territory of the city was subject to a complete redevelopment: all buildings were liquidated, with the exception of several churches, houses and a fortress. In 1796, a second reconstruction plan was drawn up, identical to the first. As a result of its implementation, by 1804 the territory of Samara had increased to 70.4 hectares. The basis for the planning of the northern part of the city was a rectangular quarter measuring 130 × 260 m. The southern part of the settlement retained its irregular character. The main type of building of this period is a low-rise estate. The directions of the streets were determined by the direction of the channel, the so-called Samara break. The city was divided into functional zones: residential areas with trade facilities, administrative and religious buildings. Community centers were located around churches and at the ship&#x27;s pier. Forges were located on the outskirts of the city. The fortress occupied 3.6 hectares, divided into a residential zone, an administrative zone (offices, a prison, a storehouse), a public one (a court, a thought), a commercial, an industrial one (warehouses, piers, forges, barns).
In 1804, a new plan for the reconstruction and expansion of Samara was drawn up, following the model of the previous ones. The old buildings in the south of the city were demolished, and a regular layout appeared in its place. In 1839, the plan was almost completely implemented. The territory of Samara has increased by 3.5 times (246.4 ha). The city occupied the entire territory along the watershed of the Volga and Samara rivers, the banks of which were built up with marinas, grain barns, warehouses, and small-scale industries. The Samara fortress was still preserved, but had already lost its significance.

In 1840, a new development plan was approved, according to which the territory of the city expanded further along the watershed, while maintaining the planning structure. The new plan reflected the nature of the prevailing wooden buildings (stone houses accounted for only 10% of the total). The size of the quarters remained the same, the city grew at the expense of adjacent agricultural land. As a major trading center, with a railroad, Samara in 1851 received the status of a provincial city. The general plan of 1853 regulated only building within the city limits, however, the settlement began to grow chaotically, numerous industrial facilities appeared: tanneries, oil mills, brick factories and mills. The development of navigation along the Volga led to the fact that piers, warehouses, sawmills and other factories occupied the entire Volga coast of the city. From 1875 to 1877, a private railway to Orenburg was built through Samara, laid along the banks of the Samara River. The residential part of the city was cut off from the banks of the industrial rivers, with the exception of a small section of the Strukovsky Garden, overlooking the Volga. By the end of the 19th century, Samara was a single planning space with a regular plan (with the exception of the Zasamarskaya settlement, which arose no later than the end of the 18th century).

====1937 General plan – Greater Kuybyshev====
The rapid growth of Kuybyshev required the development of a new master plan &quot;Big Kuibyshev&quot; in 1937, which was designed for the future, until 1956. It provided for a significant expansion of the city, turning it into a major industrial center. The main compositional axes arose along the watershed of the Volga and Samara rivers, and the second axis - Novo-Sadovaya Street. The structure highlights the main urban centers: Samara Square and the area of the Botanical Garden. The existing historical buildings were renovated and redeveloped, old cemeteries and churches were demolished to accommodate new public and cultural facilities.
The outbreak of the Great Patriotic War prevented the full implementation of the plan. In the 1940s, large defense factories were evacuated to Kuibyshev, in connection with which the area of the city during the war and the first post-war years increased by 50%, amounting to 6651.3 hectares by the end of the 40s. Factories and factories were located along the railway, east of the old city, in empty areas. Between them and the old city, new residential areas arose. New construction also unfolded in other immediate outskirts and further in the periphery.

In 1949, a new general plan of Samara was adopted, according to which the transport system developed (the emergence of new highways), a new industrial and residential area of Bezymyanka was built, new territories were developed, new planning units appeared: microdistricts. The development of the city proceeded at an intensive pace: the Kirovsky district, the village of Kryazh, the mouth of the Dry Samarka were built up. Landscaping work was underway, the reconstruction of squares (Kuibyshev and Chapaev squares), the laying of the TsPKiO. A new urban framework was formed by community centers and main highways connecting remote areas with the historical center.
However, until the end of the 1950s, the city was a conglomeration of scattered workers&#x27; settlements, located around the largest industrial enterprises. In such a system, two centers were key: the Old City (historical merchant) and the new Bezymyanka industrial district (social city). Bezymyanka was connected with the Old Town by a railway line and bus routes. This two-part structure of the city lasted until the end of the 20th century.
In the 1950s, during the construction process, the local architectural school was able to form outstanding architectural ensembles that connected the workers&#x27; settlements into a single urban system. These are the buildings of Revolution Square, Kuibyshev, Samarskaya, Chapaev, Agriculture, Kirov, Pobeda Street, Kirov, Metallurgists, Yunykh Pioneers, Kuibyshev, Novo-Sadovaya, Maslennikov, the Soviet Army and the Volga embankment.

===Climate===
Samara experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;, borders on &quot;Dfa&quot;). Samara&#x27;s humidity levels are higher in the summer than many Russian cities thanks to the precipitation levels and the close proximity to the Volga. The humidity levels usually range from 29% to 98% humidity over the period of a year. There was a record high of during a severe heat wave. Being far inland, summers are very warm and winters very cold for its latitude among European cities.

As an administrative division, it is, together with two rural localities, incorporated separately as the city of oblast significance of Samara—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Samara is incorporated as Samara Urban Okrug. In April 2015, Samara&#x27;s nine city districts were granted municipal status.

However, since 2009, a Russian &quot;anti-extremism&quot; law has led to an increase in repression of religious minorities. Local authorities and courts in Samara have targeted Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses by liquidating the group&#x27;s legal entity (&quot;Local Religious Organization&quot; or &quot;LRO&quot;) and designating it as an &quot;extremist&quot; organization. In November 2016, &quot;the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the decision of the Samara Regional Court to recognize the Samara branch of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses as an extremist organization and to ban its activities.&quot;
