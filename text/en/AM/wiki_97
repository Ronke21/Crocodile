<text>James Abbott McNeill Whistler (; July 10, 1834July 17, 1903) was an American painter in oils and watercolor, and printmaker, active during the American Gilded Age and based primarily in the United Kingdom. He eschewed sentimentality and moral allusion in painting and was a leading proponent of the credo &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot;.

His signature for his paintings took the shape of a stylized butterfly with an added long stinger for a tail. The symbol combined both aspects of his personality: his art is marked by a subtle delicacy, while his public persona was combative. He found a parallel between painting and music, and entitled many of his paintings &quot;arrangements&quot;, &quot;harmonies&quot;, and &quot;nocturnes&quot;, emphasizing the primacy of tonal harmony. His most famous painting, &quot;Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1&quot; (1871), commonly known as &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;, is a revered and often parodied portrait of motherhood. Whistler influenced the art world and the broader culture of his time with his aesthetic theories and his friendships with other leading artists and writers.

==Early life==
===Heritage===
James Abbott Whistler was born in Lowell, Massachusetts on July 10, 1834, the first child of Anna McNeill Whistler and George Washington Whistler, and the elder brother of Confederate surgeon William McNeill Whistler.

In later years, Whistler played up his mother&#x27;s connection to the American South and its roots, and he presented himself as an impoverished Southern aristocrat, although it remains unclear to what extent he truly sympathized with the Southern cause during the American Civil War. He adopted his mother&#x27;s maiden name after she died, using it as an additional middle name.

=== New England ===
His father was a railroad engineer, and Anna was his second wife. James lived the first three years of his life in a modest house at 243 Worthen Street in Lowell, Massachusetts. The house is now the Whistler House Museum of Art, a museum dedicated to him. He claimed St. Petersburg, Russia as his birthplace during the Ruskin trial: &quot;I shall be born when and where I want, and I do not choose to be born in Lowell.&quot;

Whistler was a moody child, prone to fits of temper and insolence, and he often drifted into periods of laziness after bouts of illness. His parents discovered that drawing often settled him down and helped focus his attention.

The family moved from Lowell to Stonington, Connecticut in 1837, where his father worked for the Stonington Railroad. Three of the couple&#x27;s children died in infancy during this period. Their fortunes improved considerably in 1839 when his father became chief engineer for the Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, and the family built a mansion in Springfield, Massachusetts, where the Wood Museum of History now stands. They lived in Springfield until they left the United States for Russia in late 1842.

===Russia and England===
In 1842, his father was recruited by Nicholas I of Russia to design a railroad in Russia. The Emperor learned of George Whistler&#x27;s ingenuity in engineering the Canton Viaduct for the Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, and he offered him a position engineering the Saint Petersburg-Moscow Railway. The rest of the family moved to St. Petersburg to join him in the winter of 1842/43.

After moving to St. Petersburg, the young Whistler took private art lessons, then enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Arts at age eleven. The young artist followed the traditional curriculum of drawing from plaster casts and occasional live models, revelled in the atmosphere of art talk with older peers, and pleased his parents with a first-class mark in anatomy. In 1844, he met the noted artist Sir William Allan, who came to Russia with a commission to paint a history of the life of Peter the Great. Whistler&#x27;s mother noted in her diary, &quot;the great artist remarked to me &#x27;Your little boy has uncommon genius, but do not urge him beyond his inclination.&#x27;&quot;

In 1847–1848, his family spent some time in London with relatives, while his father stayed in Russia. Whistler&#x27;s brother-in-law Francis Haden, a physician who was also an artist, spurred his interest in art and photography. Haden took Whistler to visit collectors and to lectures and gave him a watercolour set with instructions.

Whistler already was imagining an art career. He began to collect books on art and he studied other artists&#x27; techniques. When his portrait was painted by Sir William Boxall in 1848, the young Whistler exclaimed that the portrait was &quot;very much like me and a very fine picture. Mr. Boxall is a beautiful colourist... It is a beautiful creamy surface, and looks so rich.&quot; In his blossoming enthusiasm for art, at fifteen, he informed his father by letter of his future direction, &quot;I hope, dear father, you will not object to my choice.&quot; His father, however, died from cholera at the age of 49, and the Whistler family moved back to his mother&#x27;s home town of Pomfret, Connecticut.

The family lived frugally and managed to get by on a limited income. His art plans remained vague and his future uncertain. His cousin reported that Whistler at that time was &quot;slight, with a pensive, delicate face, shaded by soft brown curls ... he had a somewhat foreign appearance and manner, which, aided by natural abilities, made him very charming, even at that age.&quot;

===West Point===
Whistler was sent to Christ Church Hall School with his mother&#x27;s hopes that he would become a minister. Whistler was seldom without his sketchbook and was popular with his classmates for his caricatures. However, it became clear that a career in religion did not suit him, so he applied to the United States Military Academy at West Point, where his father had taught drawing and other relatives had attended. He was admitted to the highly selective institution in July 1851 on the strength of his family name, despite his extreme nearsightedness and poor health history. However, during his three years there, his grades were barely satisfactory, and he was a sorry sight at drill and dress, known as &quot;Curly&quot; for his hair length which exceeded regulations. Whistler bucked authority, spouted sarcastic comments, and racked up demerits. Colonel Robert E Lee was the West Point Superintendent and, after considerable indulgence toward Whistler, he had no choice but to dismiss the young cadet. Whistler&#x27;s major accomplishment at West Point was learning drawing and map making from American artist Robert W. Weir.

His departure from West Point seems to have been precipitated by a failure in a chemistry exam where he was asked to describe silicon and began by saying, &quot;Silicon is a gas.&quot; As he himself put it later: &quot;If silicon were a gas, I would have been a general one day&quot;. However, a separate anecdote suggests misconduct in drawing class as the reason for Whistler&#x27;s departure.

===First job===
After West Point, Whistler worked as draftsman mapping the entire U.S. coast for military and maritime purposes. He found the work boring and he was frequently late or absent. He spent much of his free time playing billiards and idling about, was always broke, and although a charmer, had little acquaintance with women. After it was discovered that he was drawing sea serpents, mermaids, and whales on the margins of the maps, he was transferred to the etching division of the United States Coast Survey. He lasted there only two months, but he learned the etching technique that later proved valuable to his career.
At this point, Whistler firmly decided that art would be his future. For a few months he lived in Baltimore with a wealthy friend, Tom Winans, who furnished Whistler with a studio and some spending cash. The young artist made some valuable contacts in the art community and also sold some paintings to Winans. Whistler turned down his mother&#x27;s suggestions for other more practical careers and informed her that with money from Winans, he was setting out to further his art training in Paris. Whistler never returned to the United States.

===Art study in France===
Whistler arrived in Paris in 1855, rented a studio in the Latin Quarter, and quickly adopted the life of a bohemian artist. Soon he had a French girlfriend, a dressmaker named Héloise. He studied traditional art methods for a short time at the Ecole Impériale and at the atelier of Charles Gleyre. The latter was a great advocate of the work of Ingres, and impressed Whistler with two principles that he used for the rest of his career: that line is more important than color and that black is the fundamental color of tonal harmony. Twenty years later, the Impressionists would largely overthrow this philosophy, banning black and brown as &quot;forbidden colors&quot; and emphasizing color over form. Whistler preferred self-study and enjoying the café life.

While letters from home reported his mother&#x27;s efforts at economy, Whistler spent freely, sold little or nothing in his first year in Paris, and was in steady debt. To relieve the situation, he took to painting and selling copies from works at the Louvre and finally moved to cheaper quarters. As luck would have it, the arrival in Paris of George Lucas, another rich friend, helped stabilize Whistler&#x27;s finances for a while. In spite of a financial respite, the winter of 1857 was a difficult one for Whistler. His poor health, made worse by excessive smoking and drinking, laid him low.

Conditions improved during the summer of 1858. Whistler recovered and traveled with fellow artist Ernest Delannoy through France and the Rhineland. He later produced a group of etchings known as &quot;The French Set&quot;, with the help of French master printer . During that year, he painted his first self-portrait, &quot;Portrait of Whistler with Hat&quot;, a dark and thickly rendered work reminiscent of Rembrandt. But the event of greatest consequence that year was his friendship with Henri Fantin-Latour, whom he met at the Louvre. Through him, Whistler was introduced to the circle of Gustave Courbet, which included Carolus-Duran (later the teacher of John Singer Sargent), Alphonse Legros, and Édouard Manet.

Also in this group was Charles Baudelaire, whose ideas and theories of &quot;modern&quot; art influenced Whistler. Baudelaire challenged artists to scrutinize the brutality of life and nature and to portray it faithfully, avoiding the old themes of mythology and allegory. Théophile Gautier, one of the first to explore translation qualities among art and music, may have inspired Whistler to view art in musical terms.

===London===
Reflecting his adopted circle&#x27;s banner of the Realism art movement, Whistler painted his first exhibited work, &quot;La Mère Gérard&quot; in 1858. He followed it by painting &quot;At the Piano&quot; in 1859 in London, which he adopted as his home, while also regularly visiting friends in France. &quot;At the Piano&quot; is a portrait composed of his niece and her mother in their London music room, an effort which clearly displayed his talent and promise. A critic wrote, &quot;[despite] a recklessly bold manner and sketchiness of the wildest and roughest kind, [it has] a genuine feeling for colour and a splendid power of composition and design, which evince a just appreciation of nature very rare amongst artists.&quot; The work is unsentimental and effectively contrasts the mother in black and the daughter in white, with other colors kept restrained in the manner advised by his teacher Gleyre. It was displayed at the Royal Academy the following year, and in many exhibits to come. Diana Seave Greenwald writes that &quot;At the Piano&quot; &quot;could have been inspired directly by &quot;The Concert&quot;,&quot; a painting by Johannes Vermeer.

In a second painting executed in the same room, Whistler demonstrated his natural inclination toward innovation and novelty by fashioning a genre scene with unusual composition and foreshortening. It later was re-titled &quot;Harmony in Green and Rose: The Music Room&quot;. This painting also demonstrated Whistler&#x27;s ongoing work pattern, especially with portraits: a quick start, major adjustments, a period of neglect, then a final flurry to the finish.

After a year in London, he produced a set of etchings in 1860 called &quot;Thames Set,&quot; as counterpoint to his 1858 &quot;French set,&quot; as well as some early impressionistic work including &quot;The Thames in Ice&quot;. At this stage, he was beginning to establish his technique of tonal harmony based on a limited, predetermined palette.

==Early career==
In 1861, after returning to Paris for a time, Whistler painted his first famous work, &quot;Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl&quot;. The portrait of his mistress and business manager Joanna Hiffernan was created as a simple study in white; however, others saw it differently. The critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary thought the painting an allegory of a new bride&#x27;s lost innocence. Others linked it to Wilkie Collins&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in White&quot;, a popular novel of the time, or various other literary sources. In England, some considered it a painting in the Pre-Raphaelite manner. In the painting, Hiffernan holds a lily in her left hand and stands upon a wolf skin rug (interpreted by some to represent masculinity and lust) with the wolf&#x27;s head staring menacingly at the viewer. The portrait was refused for exhibition at the conservative Royal Academy, but was shown in a private gallery under the title &quot;The Woman in White&quot;. In 1863, it was shown at the Salon des Refusés in Paris, an event sponsored by Emperor Napoleon III for the exhibition of works rejected from the Salon.

Whistler&#x27;s painting was widely noticed, although upstaged by Manet&#x27;s more shocking painting &quot;Le déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;. Countering criticism by traditionalists, Whistler&#x27;s supporters insisted that the painting was &quot;an apparition with a spiritual content&quot; and that it epitomized his theory that art should be concerned essentially with the arrangement of colors in harmony, not with a literal portrayal of the natural world.

Two years later, Whistler painted another portrait of Hiffernan in white, this time displaying his newfound interest in Asian motifs, which he entitled &quot;The Little White Girl&quot;. His &quot;Lady of the Land Lijsen&quot; and &quot;The Golden Screen&quot;, both completed in 1864, again portray his mistress, in even more emphatic Asian dress and surroundings.

During this period Whistler became close to Gustave Courbet, the early leader of the French realist school, but when Hiffernan modeled in the nude for Courbet, Whistler became enraged and his relationship with Hiffernan began to fall apart.

In January 1864, Whistler&#x27;s very religious and very proper mother arrived in London, upsetting her son&#x27;s bohemian existence and temporarily exacerbating family tensions. As he wrote to Henri Fantin-Latour, &quot;General upheaval!! I had to empty my house and purify it from cellar to eaves.&quot; He also immediately moved Hiffernan to another location.

From 1866, Whistler made his home in Chelsea, London, an area popular with artists, firstly in Cheyne Walk, then an ill-fated move to Tite Street, and finally Upper Church Street.

==Mature career==
===Nocturnes===
In 1866, Whistler decided to visit Valparaíso, Chile, a journey that has puzzled scholars, although Whistler stated that he did it for political reasons. Chile was at war with Spain and perhaps Whistler thought it a heroic struggle of a small nation against a larger one, but no evidence supports that theory. What the journey did produce was Whistler&#x27;s first three nocturnal paintings (which he originally termed &quot;moonlights&quot;): night scenes of the harbor painted with a blue or light green palette.

After he returned to London, he painted several more nocturnes over the next ten years, many of the River Thames and of Cremorne Gardens, a pleasure park famous for its frequent fireworks displays, which presented a novel challenge to paint. In his maritime nocturnes, Whistler used highly thinned paint as a ground with lightly flicked color to suggest ships, lights, and shore line. Some of the Thames paintings also show compositional and thematic similarities with the Japanese prints of Hiroshige.

In 1872, Whistler credited his patron Frederick Leyland, an amateur musician devoted to Chopin, for his musically inspired titles.

I say I can&#x27;t thank you too much for the name &#x27;Nocturne&#x27; as a title for my moonlights! You have no idea what an irritation it proves to the critics and consequent pleasure to me—besides it is really so charming and does so poetically say all that I want to say and &quot;no more&quot; than I wish!

At that point, Whistler painted another self-portrait and entitled it &quot;Arrangement in Gray: Portrait of the Painter&quot; (c. 1872), and he also began to re-title many of his earlier works using terms associated with music, such as a &quot;nocturne&quot;, &quot;symphony&quot;, &quot;harmony&quot;, &quot;study&quot; or &quot;arrangement&quot;, to emphasize the tonal qualities and the composition and to de-emphasize the narrative content. Whistler&#x27;s nocturnes were among his most innovative works. Furthermore, his submission of several nocturnes to art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel after the Franco-Prussian War gave Whistler the opportunity to explain his evolving &quot;theory in art&quot; to artists, buyers, and critics in France.

His good friend Fantin-Latour, growing more reactionary in his opinions, especially in his negativity concerning the emerging Impressionist school, found Whistler&#x27;s new works surprising and confounding. Fantin-Latour admitted, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand anything there; it&#x27;s bizarre how one changes. I don&#x27;t recognize him anymore.&quot; Their relationship was nearly at an end by then, but they continued to share opinions in occasional correspondence.

When Edgar Degas invited Whistler to exhibit with the first show by the Impressionists in 1874, Whistler turned down the invitation, as did Manet, and some scholars attributed this in part to Fantin-Latour&#x27;s influence on both men.

===Portraits===
The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 fragmented the French art community. Many artists took refuge in England, joining Whistler, including Camille Pissarro and Claude Monet, while Manet and Degas stayed in France. Like Whistler, Monet and Pissarro both focused their efforts on views of the city, and it is likely that Whistler was exposed to the evolution of Impressionism founded by these artists and that they had seen his nocturnes. Whistler was drifting away from Courbet&#x27;s &quot;damned realism&quot; and their friendship had wilted, as had his liaison with Joanna Hiffernan.

====&quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;====

By 1871, Whistler returned to portraits and soon produced his most famous painting, the nearly monochromatic full-length figure entitled &quot;Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1&quot;, but usually referred to as &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;. A model failed to appear one day, according to a letter from his mother, so Whistler turned to his mother and suggested that he do her portrait. He had her stand at first, in his typically slow and experimental way, but that proved too tiring so the seated pose was adopted. It took dozens of sittings to complete.
The austere portrait in his normally constrained palette is another Whistler exercise in tonal harmony and composition. The deceptively simple design is in fact a balancing act of differing shapes, particularly the rectangles of curtain, picture on the wall, and floor which stabilize the curve of her face, dress, and chair. Whistler commented that the painting&#x27;s narrative was of little importance, yet the painting was also paying homage to his pious mother. After the initial shock of her moving in with her son, she aided him considerably by stabilizing his behavior somewhat, tending to his domestic needs, and providing an aura of conservative respectability that helped win over patrons.

The public reacted negatively to the painting, mostly because of its anti-Victorian simplicity during a time in England when sentimentality and flamboyant decoration were in vogue. Critics thought the painting a failed &quot;experiment&quot; rather than a work of art. The Royal Academy rejected it, but then grudgingly accepted it after lobbying by Sir William Boxall—but they hung it in an unfavorable location at their exhibition.

From the start, &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot; sparked varying reactions, including parody, ridicule, and reverence, which have continued to today. Some saw it as &quot;the dignified feeling of old ladyhood&quot;, &quot;a grave sentiment of mourning&quot;, or a &quot;perfect symbol of motherhood&quot;; others employed it as a fitting vehicle for mockery. It has been satirized in endless variations in greeting cards and magazines, and by cartoon characters such as Donald Duck and Bullwinkle the Moose. Whistler did his part in promoting the picture and popularizing the image. He frequently exhibited it and authorized the early reproductions that made their way into thousands of homes. The painting narrowly escaped being burned in a fire aboard a train during shipping. It was ultimately purchased by the French government, the first Whistler work in a public collection, and is now housed in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris.
During the Great Depression in the United States, the picture was billed as a &quot;million dollar&quot; painting and was a big hit at the 1933–34 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. It was accepted as a universal icon of motherhood by the worldwide public, which was not particularly aware of or concerned with Whistler&#x27;s aesthetic theories. In recognition of its status and popularity, the United States issued a postage stamp in 1934 featuring an adaptation of the painting.

In 2015, &quot;New Yorker&quot; critic Peter Schjeldahl wrote that it &quot;remains the most important American work residing outside the United States.&quot; Martha Tedeschi writes:

&quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;, Wood&#x27;s &quot;American Gothic&quot;, Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and Edvard Munch&#x27;s &quot;The Scream&quot; have all achieved something that most paintings—regardless of their art historical importance, beauty, or monetary value—have not: they communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer. These few works have successfully made the transition from the elite realm of the museum visitor to the enormous venue of popular culture.

===Other portraits===

Other important portraits by Whistler include those of Thomas Carlyle (historian, 1873), Maud Franklin (his mistress, 1876), Cicely Alexander (daughter of a London banker, 1873), Lady Meux (socialite, 1882), and Théodore Duret (critic, 1884). In the 1870s, Whistler painted full-length portraits of his benefactor Frederick Leyland and his wife Frances. Leyland subsequently commissioned the artist to decorate his dining room (see Peacock Room below).

Whistler had been disappointed over the irregular acceptance of his works for the Royal Academy exhibitions and the poor hanging and placement of his paintings. In response, Whistler staged his first solo show in 1874. The show was notable and noticed, however, for Whistler&#x27;s design and decoration of the hall, which harmonized well with the paintings, in keeping with his art theories. A reviewer wrote, &quot;The visitor is struck, on entering the gallery, with a curious sense of harmony and fitness pervading it, and is more interested, perhaps, in the general effect than in any one work.&quot;
Whistler was not so successful a portrait painter as the other famous expatriate American John Singer Sargent. Whistler&#x27;s spare technique and his disinclination to flatter his sitters, as well as his notoriety, may account for this. He also worked very slowly and demanded extraordinarily long sittings. William Merritt Chase complained of his sitting for a portrait by Whistler, &quot;He proved to be a veritable tyrant, painting every day into the twilight, while my limbs ached with weariness and my head swam dizzily. &#x27;Don&#x27;t move! Don&#x27;t move!&#x27; he would scream whenever I started to rest.&quot; By the time he gained widespread acceptance in the 1890s, Whistler was past his prime as a portrait painter.

====Technique====
Whistler&#x27;s approach to portraiture in his late maturity was described by one of his sitters, Arthur J. Eddy, who posed for the artist in 1894:

He worked with great rapidity and long hours, but he used his colours thin and covered the canvas with innumerable coats of paint. The colours increased in depth and intensity as the work progressed. At first the entire figure was painted in greyish-brown tones, with very little flesh colour, the whole blending perfectly with the greyish-brown of the prepared canvas; then the entire background would be intensified a little; then the figure made a little stronger; then the background, and so on from day to day and week to week, and often from month to month. ... And so the portrait would really grow, really develop as an entirety, very much as a negative under the action of the chemicals comes out gradually—light, shadows, and all from the very first faint indications to their full values. It was as if the portrait were hidden within the canvas and the master by passing his wands day after day over the surface evoked the image.

===Printmaking===
Whistler produced numerous etchings, lithographs, and dry-points. His lithographs, some drawn on stone, others drawn directly on &quot;lithographie&quot; paper, are perhaps half as numerous as his etchings. Some of the lithographs are of figures slightly draped; two or three of the very finest are of Thames subjects—including a &quot;nocturne&quot; at Limehouse; while others depict the Faubourg Saint-Germain in Paris, and Georgian churches in Soho and Bloomsbury in London.
The etchings include portraits of family, mistresses, and intimate street scenes in London and Venice. Whistler gained an enormous reputation as an etcher. Martin Hardie wrote &quot;there are some who set him beside Rembrandt, perhaps above Rembrandt, as the greatest master of all time. Personally, I prefer to regard them as the Jupiter and Venus, largest and brightest among the planets in the etcher&#x27;s heaven.&quot; He took great care over the printing of his etchings and the choice of paper. At the beginning and end of his career, he placed great emphasis on cleanness of line, though in a middle period he experimented more with inking and the use of surface tone.

===Butterfly signature and painting settings===
Whistler&#x27;s famous butterfly signature first developed in the 1860s out of his interest in Asian art. He studied the potter&#x27;s marks on the china he had begun to collect and decided to design a monogram of his initials. Over time this evolved into the shape of an abstract butterfly. By around 1880, he added a stinger to the butterfly image to create a mark representing both his gentle, sensitive nature and his provocative, feisty spirit. He took great care in the appropriate placement of the image on both his paintings and his custom-made frames. His focus on the importance of balance and harmony extended beyond the frame to the placement of his paintings to their settings, and further to the design of an entire architectural element, as in the Peacock Room.

===&quot;The Peacock Room&quot;===
&quot;Harmony in Blue and Gold: The Peacock Room&quot; is Whistler&#x27;s masterpiece of interior decorative mural art. Painted in 1876–1877, it is now considered a high example of the Anglo-Japanese style.

Frederick Leyland left the room in Whistler&#x27;s care to make minor changes, &quot;to harmonize&quot; the room whose primary purpose was to display Leyland&#x27;s china collection. He painted over the original paneled room designed by Thomas Jeckyll (1827–1881), in a unified palette of brilliant blue-greens with over-glazing and metallic gold leaf.

Whistler let his imagination run wild, however: &quot;Well, you know, I just painted on. I went on—without design or sketch—putting in every touch with such freedom ... And the harmony in blue and gold developing, you know, I forgot everything in my joy of it.&quot; He completely painted over 16th-century Cordoba leather wall coverings first brought to Britain by Catherine of Aragon that Leyland had paid £1,000 for.

Having acquired the centerpiece of the room, Whistler&#x27;s painting of &quot;The Princess from the Land of Porcelain&quot;, American industrialist and aesthete Charles Lang Freer purchased the entire room in 1904 from Leyland&#x27;s heirs, including Leyland&#x27;s daughter and her husband, the British artist Val Prinsep. Freer then had the contents of the &quot;Peacock Room&quot; installed in his Detroit mansion. After Freer&#x27;s death in 1919, &quot;The Peacock Room&quot; was permanently installed in the Freer Gallery of Art at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. The gallery opened to the public in 1923. A large painted caricature by Whistler of Leyland portraying him as an anthropomorphic peacock playing a piano, and entitled &quot;The Gold Scab: Eruption in Frilthy Lucre&quot; – a pun on Leyland&#x27;s miserliness and fondness for frilly shirt fronts – is in the permanent collection of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.

===Ruskin trial===
In 1877 Whistler sued the critic John Ruskin after the critic condemned his painting &quot;Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket&quot;. Whistler exhibited the work in the Grosvenor Gallery, an alternative to the Royal Academy exhibition, alongside works by Edward Burne-Jones and other artists. Ruskin, who had been a champion of the Pre-Raphaelites and J. M. W. Turner, reviewed Whistler&#x27;s work in his publication &quot;Fors Clavigera&quot; on July 2, 1877. Ruskin praised Burne-Jones, while he attacked Whistler:

For Mr. Whistler&#x27;s own sake, no less than for the protection of the purchaser, Sir Coutts Lindsay [founder of the Grosvenor Gallery] ought not to have admitted works into the gallery in which the ill-educated conceit of the artist so nearly approached the aspect of willful imposture. I have seen, and heard, much of Cockney impudence before now; but never expected to hear a ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public&#x27;s face.

Whistler, seeing the attack in the newspaper, replied to his friend George Boughton, &quot;It is the most debased style of criticism I have had thrown at me yet.&quot; He then went to his solicitor and drew up a writ for libel, which was served to Ruskin. Whistler hoped to recover £1,000 plus the costs of the action. The case came to trial the following year after delays caused by Ruskin&#x27;s bouts of mental illness, while Whistler&#x27;s financial condition continued to deteriorate. It was heard in the Exchequer Division of the High Court on November 25 and 26, 1878, before Baron Huddleston and a special jury. Counsel for John Ruskin, Attorney General Sir John Holker, cross-examined Whistler:


Whistler had counted on many artists to take his side as witnesses, but they refused, fearing damage to their reputations. The other witnesses for him were unconvincing and the jury&#x27;s own reaction to the work was derisive. With Ruskin&#x27;s witnesses more impressive, including Edward Burne-Jones, and with Ruskin absent for medical reasons, Whistler&#x27;s counterattack was ineffective. Nonetheless, the jury reached a verdict in favor of Whistler, but awarded a mere farthing in nominal damages, and the court costs were split. The cost of the case, together with huge debts from building his residence (&quot;The White House&quot; in Tite Street, Chelsea, designed with E. W. Godwin, 1877–8), bankrupted him by May 1879, resulting in an auction of his work, collections, and house. Stansky notes the irony that the Fine Art Society of London, which had organized a collection to pay for Ruskin&#x27;s legal costs, supported him in etching &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot; (and in exhibiting the series in 1883), which helped recoup Whistler&#x27;s costs.

Whistler published his account of the trial in the pamphlet &quot;Whistler v. Ruskin: Art and Art Critics&quot;, included in his later &quot;The Gentle Art of Making Enemies&quot; (1890), in December 1878, soon after the trial. Whistler&#x27;s grand hope that the publicity of the trial would rescue his career was dashed as he lost rather than gained popularity among patrons because of it. Among his creditors was Leyland, who oversaw the sale of Whistler&#x27;s possessions. Whistler made various caricatures of his former patron, including a biting satirical painting called &quot;The Gold Scab&quot;, just after Whistler declared bankruptcy. Whistler always blamed Leyland for his financial downfall.

==Later years==


After the trial, Whistler received a commission to do twelve etchings in Venice. He eagerly accepted the assignment, and arrived in the city with girlfriend Maud Franklin, taking rooms in a dilapidated palazzo they shared with other artists, including John Singer Sargent. Although homesick for London, he adapted to Venice and set about discovering its character. He did his best to distract himself from the gloom of his financial affairs and the pending sale of all his goods at Sotheby&#x27;s. He was a regular guest at parties at the American consulate, and with his usual wit, enchanted the guests with verbal flourishes such as &quot;the artist&#x27;s only positive virtue is idleness—and there are so few who are gifted at it.&quot;

His new friends reported, on the contrary, that Whistler rose early and put in a full day of effort. He wrote to a friend, &quot;I have learned to know a Venice in Venice that the others never seem to have perceived, and which, if I bring back with me as I propose, will far more than compensate for all annoyances delays &amp; vexations of spirit.&quot; The three-month assignment stretched to fourteen months. During this exceptionally productive period, Whistler finished over fifty etchings, several nocturnes, some watercolors, and over 100 pastels—illustrating both the moods of Venice and its fine architectural details.
Furthermore, Whistler influenced the American art community in Venice, especially Frank Duveneck (and Duveneck&#x27;s &quot;boys&quot;) and Robert Blum who emulated Whistler&#x27;s vision of the city and later spread his methods and influence back to America.

Back in London, the pastels sold particularly well, and he quipped, &quot;They are not as good as I supposed. They are selling!&quot; He was actively engaged in exhibiting his other work but with limited success. Though still struggling financially, he was heartened by the attention and admiration he received from the younger generation of English and American painters who made him their idol and eagerly adopted the title &quot;pupil of Whistler&quot;. Many of them returned to America and spread tales of Whistler&#x27;s provocative egotism, sharp wit, and aesthetic pronouncements—establishing the legend of Whistler, much to his satisfaction.

In January 1881, his mother Anna Whistler died. In her honour, he publicly adopted her maiden name McNeill as a middle name.

Whistler published his first book, &quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock&quot; lecture in 1885, a major expression of his belief in &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot;. At the time, the opposing Victorian notion reigned, namely, that art, and indeed much human activity, had a moral or social function. To Whistler, however, art was its own end and the artist&#x27;s responsibility was not to society, but to himself, to interpret through art, and to neither reproduce nor moralize what he saw. Furthermore, he stated, &quot;Nature is very rarely right&quot;, and must be improved upon by the artist, with his own vision.

Though differing with Whistler on several points, including his insistence that poetry was a higher form of art than painting, Oscar Wilde was generous in his praise and hailed the lecture as a masterpiece:

not merely for its clever satire and amusing jests ... but for the pure and perfect beauty of many of its passages ... for that he is indeed one of the very greatest masters of painting, in my opinion. And I may add that in this opinion Mr. Whistler himself entirely concurs.

Whistler, however, thought himself mocked by Oscar Wilde, and from then on, public sparring ensued leading to a total breakdown of their friendship, precipitated by a report written by Herbert Vivian. Later, Wilde &quot;symbolically murdered Whistler&quot;, basing Basil Hallward, the murdered artist in his novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; on Whistler.
Whistler joined the Society of British Artists in 1884, and on June 1, 1886, he was elected president. The following year, during Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, Whistler presented to the Queen, on the Society&#x27;s behalf, an elaborate album including a lengthy written address and illustrations that he made. Queen Victoria so admired &quot;the beautiful and artistic illumination&quot; that she decreed henceforth, &quot;that the Society should be called Royal.&quot; This achievement was widely appreciated by the members, but soon it was overshadowed by the dispute that inevitably arose with the Royal Academy of Arts. Whistler proposed that members of the Royal Society should withdraw from the Royal Academy. This ignited a feud within the membership ranks that overshadowed all other society business. In May 1888, nine members wrote to Whistler to demand his resignation. At the annual meeting on June 4, he was defeated for re-election by a vote of 18–19, with nine abstentions. Whistler and 25 supporters resigned, while the anti-Whistler majority (in his view) was successful in purging him for his &quot;eccentricities&quot; and &quot;non-English&quot; background.

With his relationship with Maud Franklin unraveling, Whistler suddenly proposed to Beatrice Godwin (also called Beatrix or Trixie), a former pupil and the widow of his late friend, architect Edward William Godwin. Through his friendship with Godwin, Whistler had become close to Beatrice, whom Whistler painted in the full-length portrait titled &quot;Harmony in Red: Lamplight&quot; (GLAHA 46315). By the summer of 1888 Whistler and Beatrice appeared in public as a couple. At a dinner Louise Jopling and Henry Labouchère insisted that they should be married before the end of the week.

The marriage ceremony was quickly arranged; as a member of Parliament, Labouchère arranged for the Chaplain to the House of Commons to marry the couple. No publicity was given to the ceremony to avoid the possibility of a furious Maud Franklin interrupting the marriage ceremony. The marriage took place on August 11, 1888, with the ceremony attended by a reporter from the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, so that the event received publicity. The couple left soon after for Paris, to avoid any risk of a scene with Maud.

Whistler&#x27;s reputation in London and Paris was rising and he gained positive reviews from critics and new commissions. His book &quot;The Gentle Art of Making Enemies&quot; was published in 1890 with mixed success, but it afforded helpful publicity.
In 1890, he met Charles Lang Freer, who became a valuable patron in America, and ultimately his most important collector. Around this time, in addition to portraiture, Whistler experimented with early colour photography and with lithography, creating a series featuring London architecture and the human figure, mostly female nudes. He contributed the first three of his &quot;Songs of Stone&quot; lithographs to &quot;The Whirlwind,&quot; a Neo-Jacobite magazine published by his friend Herbert Vivian. Whistler had met Vivian in the late 1880s when both were members of the Order of the White Rose, the first of the Neo-Jacobite societies.

In 1891, with help from his close friend Stéphane Mallarmé, &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot; was purchased by the French government for 4,000 francs. This was much less than what an American collector might have paid, but that would not have been so prestigious by Whistler&#x27;s reckoning.

After an indifferent reception to his solo show in London, featuring mostly his nocturnes, Whistler abruptly decided he had had enough of London. He and Trixie moved to Paris in 1892 and resided at n° 110 Rue du Bac, Paris, with his studio at the top of 86 Rue Notre Dame des Champs in Montparnasse.

He felt welcomed by his old Paris friends Monet, Auguste Rodin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, as well as Stéphane Mallarmé, and he set himself up a large studio. He was at the top of his career when it was discovered that his wife Trixie had cancer. They returned to London in February 1896, taking rooms at the Savoy Hotel while they sought medical treatment. He made drawings on lithographic transfer paper of the view of the River Thames, from the hotel window or balcony, as he sat with her. She died a few months later.

In 1899, Charles Freer introduced Whistler to his friend and fellow businessman Richard Albert Canfield, who became a personal friend and patron of Whistler&#x27;s. Canfield owned a number of fashionable gambling houses in New York and Rhode Island, including Saratoga Springs and Newport, and was also a man of culture with refined tastes in art. He owned early American and Chippendale furniture, tapestries, Chinese porcelain and Barye bronzes, and possessed the second-largest and most important Whistler collection in the world prior to his death in 1914.

In May 1901, Canfield commissioned a portrait from Whistler; he started to pose for &quot;Portrait of Richard A. Canfield&quot; (YMSM 547) in March 1902. According to Alexander Gardiner, Canfield returned to Europe to sit for Whistler at the New Year in 1903, and sat every day until May 16, 1903. Whistler was ill and frail at this time and the work was his last completed portrait. The deceptive air of respectability that the portrait gave Canfield caused Whistler to call it &#x27;His Reverence&#x27;. The two men were in correspondence from 1901 until Whistler&#x27;s death. A few months before his own death, Canfield sold his collection of etchings, lithographs, drawings and paintings by Whistler to the American art dealer Roland F. Knoedler for $300,000. Three of Canfield&#x27;s Whistler paintings hang in the Frick Museum in New York City.

In the final seven years of his life, Whistler did some minimalist seascapes in watercolor and a final self-portrait in oil. He corresponded with his many friends and colleagues. Whistler founded an art school in 1898, but his poor health and infrequent appearances led to its closure in 1901. He died in London on July 17, 1903, six days after his 69th birthday. He is buried in Chiswick Old Cemetery in west London, adjoining St Nicholas Church, Chiswick.

Whistler was the subject of a 1908 biography by his friends, the husband-and-wife team of Joseph Pennell and Elizabeth Robins Pennell, printmaker and art critic respectively. The Pennells&#x27; vast collection of Whistler material was bequeathed to the Library of Congress. The artist&#x27;s entire estate was left to his sister-in-law Rosalind Birnie Philip. She spent the rest of her life defending his reputation and managing his art and effects, much of which eventually was donated to Glasgow University.

==Personal relationships==

Whistler had a distinctive appearance, short and slight, with piercing eyes and a curling mustache, often sporting a monocle and the flashy attire of a dandy. He affected a posture of self-confidence and eccentricity. He often was arrogant and selfish toward friends and patrons. A constant self-promoter and egoist, he relished shocking friends and enemies. Though he could be droll and flippant about social and political matters, he always was serious about art and often invited public controversy and debate to argue for his strongly held theories.

Whistler had a high-pitched, drawling voice and a unique manner of speech, full of calculated pauses. A friend said, &quot;In a second you discover that he is not conversing—he is sketching in words, giving impressions in sound and sense to be interpreted by the hearer.&quot;

Whistler was well known for his biting wit, especially in exchanges with his friend and rival Oscar Wilde. Both were figures in the Café society of Paris, and they were often the &quot;talk of the town&quot;. They frequently appeared as caricatures in &quot;Punch&quot;, to their mutual amusement. On one occasion, young Oscar Wilde attended one of Whistler&#x27;s dinners, and hearing his host make some brilliant remark, apparently said, &quot;I wish I&#x27;d said that&quot;, to which Whistler riposted, &quot;You will, Oscar, you will!&quot; In fact, Wilde did repeat in public many witticisms created by Whistler. Their relationship soured by the mid-1880s, as Whistler turned against Wilde and the Aesthetic Movement. When Wilde was publicly acknowledged to be a homosexual in 1895, Whistler openly mocked him.

Whistler reveled in preparing and managing his social gatherings. As a guest observed:

One met all the best in Society there—the people with brains, and those who had enough to appreciate them. Whistler was an inimitable host. He loved to be the Sun round whom we lesser lights revolved ... All came under his influence, and in consequence no one was bored, no one dull.

In Paris, Whistler was friends with members of the Symbolist circle of artists, writers and poets that included Stéphane Mallarmé and Marcel Schwob. Schwob had met Whistler in the mid-1890s through Stéphane Mallarmé; they had other mutual friends, including Oscar Wilde (until they argued) and Whistler&#x27;s brother-in-law, Charles Whibley.

Whistler was friendly with many French artists, including Henri Fantin-Latour, Alphonse Legros, and Gustave Courbet. He illustrated the book &quot;Les Chauves-Souris&quot; with Antonio de La Gandara. He also knew Édouard Manet and the Impressionists, notably Claude Monet, and Edgar Degas. As a young artist, he was a close friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His close friendships with Monet and poet Stéphane Mallarmé, who translated the &quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock&quot; lecture into French, helped strengthen respect for Whistler by the French public. Whistler was friendly with his fellow students at Gleyre&#x27;s studio, including Ignace Schott, whose son Leon Dabo Whistler later would mentor.

Whistler&#x27;s lover and model for &quot;The White Girl&quot;, Joanna Hiffernan, also posed for Gustave Courbet. Historians speculate that Courbet used her as the model for his erotic paintings &quot;Le Sommeil&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Origine du monde&quot;, possibly leading to the breakup of the friendship between Whistler and Courbet.

During the 1870s and much of the 1880s, he lived with his model and mistress Maud Franklin. Her ability to endure long, repetitive sittings helped Whistler develop his portrait skills. He not only made several excellent portraits of her, but she was also a helpful stand-in for other sitters. Whistler had two daughters by Maud Franklin: Ione (born circa 1877) and Maud McNeill Whistler Franklin (born 1879). Maud sometimes referred to herself as &#x27;Mrs. Whistler&#x27;, and in the census of 1881 gave her name as &#x27;Mary M. Whistler&#x27;.

Whistler had several extramarital children, of whom Charles James Whistler Hanson (1870–1935) is the best documented. After Whistler parted from his mistress Joanna Hiffernan, she helped to raise Hanson, even though his mother was the parlour maid, Louisa Fanny Hanson.

In 1888, Whistler married Beatrice Godwin, whom he called Beatrix or Trixie. She was the widow of his friend E. W. Godwin, the architect who had designed Whistler&#x27;s &quot;White House&quot;, and the daughter of the sculptor John Birnie Philip and his wife Frances Black. Beatrix and her sisters Rosalind Birnie Philip and Ethel Whibley posed for many of Whistler&#x27;s paintings and drawings; with Ethel Whibley modeling for &quot;Mother of Pearl and Silver: The Andalusian&quot; (1888–1900). The first five years of their marriage were very happy, but her later life was a time of misery for the couple, due to her illness and eventual death from cancer. Near the end, she lay comatose much of the time, completely subdued by morphine, given for pain relief. Her death was a heavy blow Whistler never quite overcame.

==Legacy==

Whistler was inspired by and incorporated many sources in his art, including the work of Rembrandt, Velázquez, and ancient Greek sculpture to develop his own highly influential and individual style. He was adept in many media, with over 500 paintings, as well as etchings, pastels, watercolors, drawings, and lithographs. Whistler was a leader in the Aesthetic Movement, promoting, writing, and lecturing on the &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot; philosophy. With his pupils, he advocated simple design, economy of means, the avoidance of over-labored technique, and the tonal harmony of the final result.

Whistler has been the subject of many major museum exhibitions, studies, and publications. Like the Impressionists, he employed nature as an artistic resource. Whistler insisted that it was the artist&#x27;s obligation to interpret what he saw, not be a slave to reality, and to &quot;bring forth from chaos glorious harmony&quot;.

During his life, he influenced many artists throughout the English-speaking world. Whistler had significant contact and exchanged ideas and ideals with Realist, Impressionist, and Symbolist painters. The artist Walter Sickert was his pupil, and the writer Oscar Wilde was his friend. His Tonalism had a profound effect on many American artists, including John Singer Sargent, William Merritt Chase, Henry Salem Hubbell, Willis Seaver Adams (whom he befriended in Venice) and Arthur Frank Mathews, whom Whistler met in Paris in the late 1890s and who took Whistler&#x27;s Tonalism to San Francisco, spawning a broad use of that technique among turn-of-the-century California artists. Whistler was also a major influence on the 1880s Heidelberg School movement in Australia, otherwise known as Australian impressionism. As American critic Charles Caffin wrote in 1907:

He did better than attract a few followers and imitators; he influenced the whole world of art. Consciously or unconsciously, his presence is felt in countless studios; his genius permeates modern artistic thought.

During a fourteen-month stay in Venice in 1879 and 1880, Whistler created a series of etchings and pastels that not only reinvigorated his finances (this was after he had declared bankruptcy following the Ruskin trial), but also re-energized the way in which artists and photographers interpreted the city—focusing on the back alleys, side canals, entrance ways, and architectural patterns—and capturing the city&#x27;s unique atmospherics.

In 1940 Whistler was commemorated on a United States postage stamp when the U.S. Post Office issued a set of 35 stamps commemorating America&#x27;s famous authors, poets, educators, scientists, composers, artists, and inventors: the Famous Americans Series.

The Gilbert and Sullivan operetta &quot;Patience&quot; pokes fun at the Aesthetic movement, and the lead character of Reginald Bunthorne is often identified as a send-up of Oscar Wilde, though Bunthorne is more likely an amalgam of several prominent artists, writers, and Aesthetic figures. Bunthorne wears a monocle and has prominent white streaks in his dark hair, as did Whistler.

Novelist Henry James &quot;had become well enough acquainted with Whistler to base several fictional characters on the &#x27;queer little Londonized Southerner,&#x27; most notably in &quot;Roderick Hudson&quot; and &quot;The Tragic Muse&quot;&quot;. Whistler &quot;also appeared as one of Henry James&#x27;s most attractive minor characters, the sculptor Gloriani in &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;, whose personality, way of life, and even home are closely based on Whistler.&quot;

George du Maurier&#x27;s 1894 novel &quot;Trilby&quot; has a character, Joe Sibley, &quot;the idle apprentice,&quot; who was meant to depict Whistler. &quot;Whistler threatened to sue, and in subsequent editions the character was replaced by another.&quot; Whistler was also the model for a character in Marcel Proust&#x27;s novel, &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; — the painter Elstir.

Whistler was the favorite artist of singer and actress Doris Day. She owned and displayed an original etching of Whistler&#x27;s &quot;Rotherhithe&quot; and two of his original lithographs, &quot;The Steps, Luxembourg Gardens, Paris&quot; and &quot;The Pantheon, from the Terrace of the Luxembourg Gardens&quot;.

The Lowell, Massachusetts, house in which Whistler was born is now preserved as the Whistler House Museum of Art. He is buried at St Nicholas Church, Chiswick.

<text>The Hockey Hall of Fame () is a museum and hall of fame located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Dedicated to the history of ice hockey, it holds exhibits about players, teams, National Hockey League (NHL) records, memorabilia and NHL trophies, including the Stanley Cup. Founded in Kingston, Ontario, the Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1943 under the leadership of James T. Sutherland. The first class of honoured members was inducted in 1945, before the Hall of Fame had a permanent location. It moved to Toronto in 1958 after the NHL withdrew its support for the International Hockey Hall of Fame in Kingston, Ontario, due to funding issues. Its first permanent building opened at Exhibition Place in 1961. The hall was relocated in 1993, and is now in Downtown Toronto, inside Brookfield Place, and a historic Bank of Montreal building. The Hockey Hall of Fame has hosted International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) exhibits and the IIHF Hall of Fame since 1998.
An 18-person committee of players, coaches and others meets annually in June to select new honourees, who are inducted as players, builders or on-ice officials. In 2010, a subcategory was established for female players. The builders&#x27; category includes coaches, general managers, commentators, team owners and others who have helped build the game. Honoured members are inducted into the Hall of Fame in an annual ceremony held at the Hall of Fame building in November, which is followed by a special &quot;Hockey Hall of Fame Game&quot; between the Toronto Maple Leafs and a visiting team. , 299 players (including ten women), 115 builders and 16 on-ice officials have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame has been criticized for focusing mainly on players from the National Hockey League and largely ignoring players from other North American and international leagues.

==History==
The Hockey Hall of Fame was established through the efforts of James T. Sutherland, a former president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA). Sutherland sought to establish it in Kingston, Ontario as he believed that the city was the birthplace of hockey. In 1943, the NHL and CAHA reached an agreement that a Hall of Fame would be established in Kingston. Originally called the &quot;International Hockey Hall of Fame&quot;, its mandate was to honour great hockey players and to raise funds for a permanent location. The first nine &quot;honoured members&quot; (players Hobey Baker, Charlie Gardiner, Eddie Gerard, Frank McGee, Howie Morenz, Tommy Phillips, Harvey Pulford, Hod Stuart and Georges Vezina) were inducted on April 30, 1945, although the Hall of Fame still did not have a permanent home. The first board of governors included hockey executives Red Dutton, Art Ross, Frank Sargent, and Lester Patrick; and journalists Abbie Coo, Wes McKnight, Basil O&#x27;Meara, J. P. Fitzgerald, and W. A. Hewitt.

Kingston lost its most influential advocate as permanent site of the Hockey Hall of Fame when Sutherland died in 1955. By 1958, the Hockey Hall of Fame had still not raised sufficient funds to construct a permanent building in Kingston. Clarence Campbell, then President of the NHL, grew tired of waiting for the construction to begin and withdrew the NHL&#x27;s support to situate the hall in Kingston. In January 1958, the NHL and the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) reached an agreement to establish a new Hall of Fame building in Toronto, and Frank J. Selke was named managing director of the project.

The temporary Hockey Hall of Fame opened as an exhibit within Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame at Exhibition Place in August 1958, and 350,000 people visited it during the 1958 CNE fair. Due to the success of the exhibit, NHL and CNE decided that a permanent home in the Exhibition Place was needed. The NHL agreed to fully fund the building of the new facility on the grounds of Exhibition Place, and construction began in 1960.

The first permanent Hockey Hall of Fame, which shared a building with the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, was opened on August 26, 1961, by Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. Over 750,000 people visited the Hall in its inaugural year. Admission to the Hockey Hall of Fame was free until 1980, when the Hockey Hall of Fame facilities underwent expansion.

By 1986, the Hall of Fame was running out of room in its existing facilities and the board of directors decided that a new home was needed. The Hall vacated the Exhibition Place building in 1992, and its half was taken over by the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. The building was eventually demolished; portion of its façade was preserved as an entrance to BMO Field stadium. Development of the new location in the BCE Place complex (now Brookfield Place, featuring the former Bank of Montreal at the corner of Yonge and Front Streets in Toronto, began soon after. The design was by Frank Darling and S. George Curry. The new Hockey Hall of Fame officially opened on June 18, 1993. The new location has of exhibition space, seven times larger than that of the old facility. The Hockey Hall of Fame averaged an annual attendance of 292,000 between 1994 and 2019.

==Operations and organization==
The first curator of the new Hall of Fame was Bobby Hewitson. Following Hewitson&#x27;s retirement in 1967, Lefty Reid was appointed to the position. Reid was curator of the Hockey Hall of Fame for the next 25 years, retiring in 1992. Following Reid&#x27;s retirement, former NHL referee-in-chief Scotty Morrison, who was the president of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 1986, was appointed curator. Morrison supervised the relocation of the Hall of Fame and its exhibits. The current curator is Phil Pritchard.

The Hockey Hall of Fame is led by Lanny McDonald, Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Denomme. McDonald will be succeeded by Mike Gartner when his term expires in June 2025. The Hall of Fame is operated as a non-profit business called the &quot;Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum&quot; (HHFM), independent of the National Hockey League. It was originally sponsored by the NHL and Hockey Canada and revenue is generated mainly through admissions.

==Exhibits==

The Hockey Hall of Fame has 15 exhibit areas covering . Visitors can view trophies, memorabilia and equipment worn by players during special games. The Esso Great Hall, described as &quot;a Cathedral to the icons of Hockey&quot;, contains portraits and biographical information about every Hall of Fame honoured member. The centrepiece of the Great Hall is the Stanley Cup; for part of the year a replica is put on display when the presentation cup travels outside of the Hall of Fame. The original version of the Cup and the older rings, as well as all of the current National Hockey League trophies, are displayed in the bank vault, an alcove off the Great Hall. The Hall of Fame induction ceremony was held in the Great Hall until it outgrew the space and moved to the Allan Lambert Galleria in Brookfield Place.

The NHL Zone is a large area featuring displays relating to the NHL. Current teams and players are highlighted in the NHL Today area, while the NHL Retro displays include memorabilia and information about every NHL team past and present. The NHL Legends area features rotating exhibits focusing on honoured members; and NHL Milestones displays exhibits of noteworthy records including Darryl Sittler&#x27;s ten-point game and Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s all-time points record. The Stanley Cup dynasties exhibit features displays that include memorabilia from the rosters of nine teams considered to be dynasties because they dominated the NHL for several years at a time. This area also has a replica of the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; dressing room as it existed at the old Montreal Forum. The St. Louis Bar and Grill Arena Zone is dedicated to hockey across all levels of play in North America; it includes exhibits about various leagues and sections on women&#x27;s and disabled hockey leagues. Newly renovated, the exhibit now contains several big ticket items including trophies from multiple North American leagues, artifacts from all Original Six arena&#x27;s, and a full size Zamboni machine once used at the Boston Garden.

Interactive displays are featured in the NHLPA Be A Player Zone. At the &quot;NHLPA Gametime&quot;, visitors take shots using real pucks at a computer simulation of goaltender Ed Belfour. Visitors can also take turns playing goaltender, blocking shots from computer simulations of players like Sidney Crosby, Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier. The TSN/RDS Broadcast Zone provides a look at how hockey broadcasting works and allows users to record messages that may be displayed on both the Hockey Hall of Fame&#x27;s website, and the TSN/RDS networks.

===World of Hockey Zone===

While many of the Hall of Fame exhibits are dedicated to the NHL, there is a large section devoted to hockey leagues and players outside North America. On June 29, 1998, the &quot;World of Hockey Zone&quot; opened. It is a area dedicated to international hockey, including World and Olympic competition and contains profiles on all International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) member countries.

The IIHF agreed to transfer its exhibits from the International Hockey Hall of Fame in Kingston, Ontario, to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998. The &quot;World of Hockey Zone&quot; is sponsored by Tissot. The zone includes the IIHF Hockey Hall of Fame honour roll, listing each inductee by country and year of enshrinement. Each national association member of the IIHF is represented in the collection of artifacts in the display, which includes many national team hockey jerseys. The World of Hockey also recognizes members of the Triple Gold Club, and displays memorabilia from the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; at the 1980 Winter Olympic Games. Other notable events included are the 1972 Summit Series, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Ice Hockey World Championships, national-level hockey leagues in Europe, the Spengler Cup, the World Cup of Hockey, and the Canada Cup.

A new addition to the World of Hockey is Women&#x27;s Hockey: Celebrating Excellence. This exhibit takes a deep dive into the history of the women&#x27;s game and features stories and artifacts beginning with the earliest days of women&#x27;s hockey and continuing through to the PWHL.

==Hall of Fame==
===Selection process===
As of 2009, new members can be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as players, builders or on-ice officials. The builders&#x27; category includes coaches, general managers, commentators, team owners and others who have helped build the game. The category for on-ice officials was added in 1961 and a &quot;veteran player&quot; category was established in 1988. The purpose of the category was to &quot;provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players&quot;. Eleven players were inducted into that category, but in 2000, the Board of Directors eliminated it; the players who had been inducted under this category were merged into the player category.

Candidates for membership in the Hockey Hall of Fame are nominated by an 18-person selection committee. The committee includes Hockey Hall of Fame members, hockey personnel and media personalities associated with the game; the membership is representative of &quot;areas throughout the world where hockey is popular&quot;, and includes at least one member who is knowledgeable about international hockey and one member who is knowledgeable about amateur hockey. Committee members are appointed by the Board of Directors to a three-year term. The terms of the committee members are staggered so that each year there are six newly appointed or reappointed members. As of November 2018, the selection committee includes: chairman John Davidson, James M. Gregory (Chairman Emeritus), and committee members David Branch, Brian Burke, Colin Campbell, Cassie Campbell-Pascall, Mark Chipman, Bob Clarke, Marc de Foy, Michael Farber, Ron Francis, Mike Gartner, Anders Hedberg, Jari Kurri, Igor Larionov, Pierre McGuire, Bob McKenzie, David Poile, and Luc Robitaille.

Each committee member is allowed to nominate one person in each category per year. Nominations must be submitted to the chairman of the board of directors by April 15 of the nomination year. The committee then meets in June where a series of secret ballot votes is held; any player with the support of 75% of the members of the committee present is inducted. If the maximum number of players does not receive 75% after the first round of voting, then run-off votes are held. Players with less than 50% are dropped from consideration for that year and voting continues until either the maximum number of inductees is reached or all remaining nominees receive between 50% and 75%. In any given year, a maximum of four players, two builders, and one on-ice official are inducted as members. Player and on-ice officials must have not participated in a professional or international game for a minimum of three years to be eligible for nomination. Builders may be &quot;active or inactive&quot;.
The waiting period was waived for ten players deemed exceptionally notable; Dit Clapper (1947), Maurice Richard (1961), Ted Lindsay (1966), Red Kelly (1969), Terry Sawchuk (1971), Jean Beliveau (1972), Gordie Howe (1972), Bobby Orr (1979), Mario Lemieux (1997), and Wayne Gretzky (1999). Following Gretzky&#x27;s induction, the Board of Directors determined that the waiting period would no longer be waived for any player except under &quot;certain humanitarian circumstances&quot;. Three Hall of Fame members came out of retirement after their induction and resumed a career in the National League: Gordie Howe, Guy Lafleur and Mario Lemieux. Chris Pronger and Shea Weber were inducted in 2015 and 2024 while still technically active players; Pronger and Weber were under contract with the Philadelphia Flyers and the Utah Hockey Club at the time of their induction. Pronger&#x27;s contract expired after the 2016–17 season and Weber&#x27;s contract will expire after the 2025–26 season. The Hall of Fame amended its by-laws by introducing the &quot;three-year waiting period&quot;, which made Pronger and Weber eligible for induction since they last played in 2011 and 2021, respectively.

On March 31, 2009, the Hall of Fame announced new by-law additions which were implemented on January 1, 2010. Starting in 2010, male and female players are considered for induction separately and a maximum of two women can be inducted as players per year. The by-law also clarifies that a builder does not need to have been a coach, manager or executive to be inducted. Although they remain separate categories, the builders and on-ice officials are considered on the same ballot and a combined maximum of two can be inducted each year. The board of directors will now meet at least once every five years to consider potential changes to the limits.

There is also a category for &quot;Media honourees&quot;. The Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award is awarded by the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association to &quot;distinguished members of the newspaper profession whose words have brought honour to journalism and to hockey&quot;. The Foster Hewitt Memorial Award is awarded by the NHL Broadcasters&#x27; Association to &quot;members of the radio and television industry who made outstanding contributions to their profession and the game during their career in hockey broadcasting&quot;. The voting for both awards is conducted by their respective associations. While media honourees are not considered full inductees, they are still honoured with a display at the Hockey Hall of Fame. The ceremonies associated with these awards are held separately from the induction of the members of the Hall of Fame. Some of the award winners have also been inducted into the Hall of Fame as builders, including Foster Hewitt.

===Induction ceremony===
The induction ceremony was held at the Hall of Fame from 1959 until 1974. In 1975, it was held at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto and would be held there until 1979. From 1980 to 1992, the ceremony was held at various different locations in Toronto, except for 1986, 1987 and 1991 when the ceremonies were held in Vancouver, Detroit and Ottawa respectively. Since 1993, it has been held at the current Hall of Fame building. The ceremony was first broadcast by The Sports Network in 1994. 

In 1999 the &quot;Hockey Hall of Fame game&quot; was established, a contest between the Toronto Maple Leafs and a visiting team, with a special ceremony honouring that year&#x27;s inductees held before the game. Robert Tychkowski of the &quot;Edmonton Sun&quot; reports that many, including Edmonton Oilers president Kevin Lowe, believe the induction ceremony should be held on a night when there are no NHL games scheduled. This would allow a more representative portion of the hockey world to attend.

===Criticism===
The Hall of Fame has been criticized for inducting several lacklustre candidates in the early 2000s decade due to &quot;a shortage of true greatness&quot;. Since then, some have claimed that the Hall of Fame has become too exclusive. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for failing to induct international players; critics re-emphasized, from 2005 to 2007, that the Hall has been far too focused on the National Hockey League, that it is more of an &quot;NHL Hall of Fame&quot; than a general Hockey Hall of Fame. Partially in response to these claims, the Hall of Fame has hosted International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) exhibits and the IIHF Hall of Fame since 1998, and announced that it would start looking at more international players for induction. While Vladislav Tretiak had been a notable inductee in 1989, Valeri Kharlamov was inducted in 2005, and is one of the few other modern-day inductees to never play in the NHL. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for overlooking World Hockey Association players and overrepresenting the Original Six era from 1942 to 1967. For several years, the Hall of Fame was criticized for overlooking female hockey players before the Hall of Fame announced that women would be given separate consideration. In 2010, Angela James and Cammi Granato were the first women to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

One of the most discussed potential nominees is Paul Henderson, who scored the winning goal in the final moments of the deciding eighth game of the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union. This is one of the best-known moments in hockey and Canadian sports history. While there is little question of the historical significance of that goal, Henderson&#x27;s NHL statistics are not at a level comparable to those players usually selected for induction. His candidacy led to many debates among hockey fans and columnists.

===Controversy===
====Conn Smythe resignation====
Conn Smythe served as the Hall&#x27;s chairman for several years, but resigned in June 1971 when Harvey &quot;Busher&quot; Jackson was posthumously elected into the Hall. Smythe said that it made him sick to think of Jackson alongside such Toronto Maple Leafs players as &quot;Apps, Primeau, Conacher, Clancy and Kennedy. If the standards are going to be lowered I&#x27;ll get out as chairman of the board.&quot; Jackson was notorious for his off-ice lifestyle of drinking and broken marriages. Smythe would not condone the induction and even tried to block it because he considered Jackson a poor role model. Frank J. Selke, head of the selection committee, defended the selection on the belief that a man should not be shut out &quot;because of the amount of beer he drank&quot;.

====Gil Stein dispute====
On March 30, 1993, it was announced that Gil Stein, who at the time had been president of the National Hockey League for nine months but had been overlooked for the new job of commissioner in favour of Gary Bettman, would be inducted into the Hall of Fame. There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the Hall&#x27;s board of directors. Due to these allegations, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman hired two independent lawyers, Arnold Burns and Yves Fortier, to lead an investigation. They concluded that Stein had &quot;improperly manipulated the process&quot; and &quot;created the false appearance and illusion&quot; that his nomination was the idea of Bruce McNall. They concluded that Stein pressured McNall to nominate him and had refused to withdraw his nomination when asked to do so by Bettman. There was a dispute over McNall&#x27;s role and Stein was &quot;categorical in stating that the idea was Mr. McNall&#x27;s&quot;. They recommended that Stein&#x27;s selection be overturned, but it was revealed Stein had decided to turn down the induction before their announcement.

====Alan Eagleson resignation====
In 1989, Alan Eagleson, a longtime executive director of the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA), was inducted as a builder. He resigned nine years later from the Hall after pleading guilty to mail fraud and embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the NHLPA pension funds. His resignation came six days before a vote was scheduled to determine if he should be expelled from the Hall. Originally, the Hall of Fame was not going to become involved in the issue, but was forced to act when dozens of inductees, including Bobby Orr, Ted Lindsay and Brad Park, campaigned for Eagleson&#x27;s expulsion, even threatening to renounce their membership if he was not removed. He became the first member of a sports hall of fame in North America to resign.

Brought up in Poland, she graduated from Warsaw University and emigrated to Australia in 1972, where she has lived since. With over twenty published books, many of which have been translated into other languages, she is a prolific writer.

Wierzbicka is known for her work in semantics, pragmatics and cross-cultural linguistics, especially for the natural semantic metalanguage and the concept of semantic primes. Her research agenda resembles Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz&#x27;s original &quot;alphabet of human thought&quot;. Wierzbicka credits her colleague, linguist Andrzej Bogusławski, with reviving it in the late 1960s.

==Biography==

Wierzbicka was born in 1938, just before the outbreak of World War II.
She received her PhD from the Institute of Literary Research, Polish Academy of Sciences in 1964 and subsequently her habilitation degree five years later. Since 1973 she has been working at ANU, from 1989 as a professor. 1988 saw her elected fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. In 1996 she was elected a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia.
Throughout her career she has collaborated closely with Polish researchers, and was awarded the Prize of the Foundation for Polish Science for developing the theory of the natural semantic metalanguage and discovering a set of elementary meanings common to all languages. Her work spans a number of disciplines, including anthropology, psychology, cognitive science, philosophy, and religious studies as well as linguistics.

==Natural semantic metalanguage==

In her 1972 book &quot;Semantic Primitives&quot;, she launched a theory of natural semantic metalanguage, a theory of language and meaning that is intended to be language neutral. Over the next 35 years, Wierzbicka refined the concept and developed an inventory of about 200 basic meanings that are established/checked with a sequence of five statements. She claims these meanings to be the nucleus of human language as such.

<text>In law, a citation or introductory signal is a set of phrases or words used to clarify the authority (or significance) of a legal citation as it relates to a proposition. It is used in citations to present authorities and indicate how those authorities relate to propositions in statements. Legal writers use citation signals to tell readers how the citations support (or do not support) their propositions, organizing citations in a hierarchy of importance so the reader can quickly determine the relative weight of a citation. Citation signals help a reader to discern meaning or usefulness of a reference when the reference itself provides inadequate information.

Citation signals have different meanings in different U.S. citation-style systems. The two most prominent citation manuals are &quot;The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation&quot; and the &quot;ALWD Citation Manual&quot;. Some state-specific style manuals also provide guidance on legal citation. The &quot;Bluebook&quot; citation system is the most comprehensive and the most widely used system by courts, law firms and law reviews.

==Use==
In legal writing, citation signals appear before the citation that is being introduced. For example:
In the above sentence, the signal &quot;See generally&quot; is used to indicate that the source presents helpful background material related to the proposition.

==Signals indicating support==

===No signal===
It is acceptable to cite an authority without using an introductory signal when the cited authority (1) directly states the proposition, (2) identifies the source of a quotation, or (3) identifies an authority referred to in the text. For example:
In the above example, the author is restating numerical data from an authority and then directly quoting another authority, so no introductory signal is necessary.

===&quot;e.g.&quot;===
This signal, an abbreviation of the Latin &quot;exempli gratia&quot;, means &quot;for example&quot;. It tells the reader that the citation supports the proposition; although other authorities also support the proposition, their citation(s) may not be useful or necessary. This signal may be used in combination with other signals, preceded by an italicized comma. The comma after &quot;e.g.&quot;, is not italicized when attached to another signal at the end (whether supportive or not), but is italicized when &quot;e.g.&quot; appears alone. Examples: Parties challenging state abortion laws have sharply disputed in some courts the contention that a purpose of these laws, when enacted, was to protect prenatal life. &quot;See, e.g.&quot;, &quot;Abele v. Markle&quot;, 342 F. Supp. 800 (D. Conn.1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-56. Unfortunately, hiring undocumented laborers is a widespread industry practice. &quot;E.g.&quot;, &quot;Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Bellefonte Ins. Co.&quot;, 548 F. Supp. 1329, 1331 (E.D. Pa. 1982).

===Accord===
&quot;Accord&quot; is used when two or more sources state or support the proposition, but the text quotes (or refers to) only one; the other sources are then introduced by &quot;accord&quot;. Legal writers often use &quot;accord&quot; to indicate that the law of one jurisdiction is in accord with that of another jurisdiction. Examples: &quot;[N]ervousness alone does not justify extended detention and questioning about matters not related to the stop.&quot; &quot;United States v. Chavez-Valenzuela&quot;, 268 F.3d 719,725 (9th Cir. 2001); &quot;accord United States v. Beck&quot;, 140 F.3d 1129, 1139 (8th Cir. 1998); &quot;United States v. Wood&quot;, 106 F.3d 942, 248 (10th Cir. 1997); &quot;United States v. Tapia&quot;, 912 F.2d 1367, 1370 (11th Cir. 1990). &quot;... The term &#x27;Fifth Amendment&#x27; in the context of our time is commonly regarded as being synonymous with the privilege against self-incrimination&quot;. &quot;Quinn v. United States&quot;, 349 U.S. 155, 163, 75 S. Ct. 668, 99 L. Ed. 964 (1955); &quot;accord In re Johnny V.&quot;, 85 Cal. App. 3d 120, 149 Cal.Rptr. 180, 184, 188 (Cal. Ct. App. 1978) (holding that the statement &quot;I&#x27;ll take the fifth&quot; was an assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege).

===See===
&quot;See&quot; indicates that the cited authority supports, but does not directly state, the proposition given. Used similarly to no signal, to indicate that the proposition follows from the cited authority. It may also be used to refer to a cited authority which supports the proposition. For example, before 1997 the IDEA was silent on the subject of private school reimbursement, but courts had granted such reimbursement as &quot;appropriate&quot; relief under principles of equity pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C ). &quot;See Burlington&quot;, 471 U.S. at 370, 105 S.Ct. 1996 (&quot;[W]e are confident that by empowering the court to grant &#x27;appropriate&#x27; relief Congress meant to include retroactive reimbursement to parents as an available remedy in a proper case.&quot;); 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C ) (&quot;In any action brought under this paragraph, the court ... shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.&quot;).

===See also===
This indicates that the cited authority constitutes additional material which supports the proposition less directly than that indicated by &quot;see&quot; or &quot;accord&quot;. &quot;See also&quot; may be used to introduce a case supporting the stated proposition which is distinguishable from previously-cited cases. It is sometimes used to refer readers to authorities supporting a proposition when other supporting authorities have already been cited or discussed. A parenthetical explanation of the source&#x27;s relevance, after a citation introduced by &quot;see also&quot;, is encouraged. For example, &quot; ... Omitting the same mental element in a similar weapons possession statute, such as RCW 9.41.040, strongly indicates that the omission was purposeful and that strict liability was intended. &quot;See generally&quot; &quot;State v. Alvarez&quot;, 74 Wash. App. 250, 260, 872 P.2d 1123 (1994) (omission of &quot;course of conduct&quot; language in criminal counterpart to civil antiharassment act indicated &quot;Legislature consciously chose to criminalize a single act rather than a course of conduct.&quot;) aff&#x27;d, 128 Wash.2d 1, 904 P.2d 754 (1995); &quot;see also&quot; &quot;State v. Roberts&quot;, 117 Wash.2d 576, 586, 817 P.2d 855 (1991) (use of certain statutory language in one instance, and different language in another, evinces different legislative intent) (citing cases).&quot; Source: &quot;State v. Anderson&quot;, 141 Wash.2d 357, 5 P.3d 1247, 1253 (2000).

===&quot;Cf.&quot;===

From the Latin &quot;confer&quot; (&quot;compare&quot;), this signals that a cited proposition differs from the main proposition but is sufficiently analogous to lend support. An explanatory parenthetical note is recommended to clarify the citation&#x27;s relevance. For example, it is precisely this kind of conjecture and hair-splitting that the Supreme Court wanted to avoid when it fashioned the bright-line rule in Miranda. &quot;Cf&quot;. &quot;Davis&quot;, 512 U.S. at 461 (noting that where the suspect asks for counsel, the benefit of the bright-line rule is the &quot;clarity and ease of application&quot; that &quot;can be applied by officers in the real world without unduly hampering the gathering of information&quot; by forcing them &quot;to make difficult judgment calls&quot; with a &quot;threat of suppression if they guess wrong&quot;).

==Signal indicating background material==

===See generally===
This signal indicates that the cited authority presents background material relevant to the proposition. Legal scholars generally encourage the use of parenthetical explanations of the source material&#x27;s relevance following each authority using &quot;see generally&quot;, and this signal can be used with primary and secondary sources. For example, it is a form of &quot;discrimination&quot; because the complainant is being subjected to differential treatment. &quot;See generally Olmstead v. L. C&quot;., 527 U.S. 581, 614, 144 L. Ed. 2d 540, 119 S. Ct. 2176 (1999) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (finding that the &quot;normal definition of discrimination&quot; is &quot;differential treatment&quot;).

==Signals indicating contradiction==

===&quot;Contra&quot;===
This signals that the cited authority directly contradicts a given point. &quot;Contra&quot; is used where no signal would be used for support. For example: &quot;Before &quot;Blakely&quot;, courts around the country had found that &#x27;statutory minimum&#x27; was the maximum sentence allowed by law for the crime, rather than the maximum &quot;standard&quot; range sentence. &quot;See, e.g.,&quot; &quot;State v. Gore&quot;, 143 Wash. 2d 288, 313-14, 21 P.3d 262 (2001), &quot;overruled by State v. Hughes&quot;, 154 Wash. 2d 118, 110 P.3d 192 (2005). &quot;Contra Blakely&quot;, 124 S. Ct. at 2536-37.&quot;

===But see===
The cited authority contradicts the stated proposition, directly or implicitly. &quot;But see&quot; is used in opposition where &quot;see&quot; is used for support. For example: &quot;Specifically, under &quot;Roberts&quot;, there may have been cases in which courts erroneously determined that testimonial statements were reliable. &quot;But see Bockting v. Bayer&quot;, 418 F.3d at 1058 (O&#x27;Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).&quot;

===&quot;But cf.&quot;===
The cited authority contradicts the stated proposition by analogy; a parenthetical explanation of the source&#x27;s relevance is recommended. For example: &quot;But cf.&quot; 995 F.2d, at 1137 (observing that &quot;[i]n the ordinary tort claim arising when a government driver negligently runs into another car, jury trial is precisely what is lost to a plaintiff when the government is substituted for the employee&quot;).

&quot;But&quot; should be omitted from &quot;but see&quot; and &quot;but cf.&quot; when the signal follows another negative signal: &quot;Contra&quot; &quot;Blake v. Kiline&quot;, 612 F.2d 718, 723-24 (3d Cir. 1979); &quot;see&quot; CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, LAW OF FEDERAL COURTS 48 (4th ed. 1983).

==Signals indicating comparison==

===Compare===
This signal compares two or more authorities who reach different outcomes for a stated proposition. Because the relevance of the comparison may not be readily apparent to the reader, &quot;The Bluebook&quot; recommends adding a parenthetical explanation after each authority. Either &quot;compare&quot; or &quot;with&quot; may be followed by more than one source, using &quot;and&quot; between each. Legal writers italicize &quot;compare&quot;, &quot;with&quot; and &quot;and&quot;. &quot;Compare&quot; is used with &quot;with&quot;, with the &quot;with&quot; preceded by a comma. If &quot;and&quot; is used, it is also preceded by a comma. For example: To characterize the first element as a &quot;distortion&quot;, however, requires the concurrence to second-guess the way in which the state court resolved a plain conflict in the language of different statutes. &quot;Compare&quot; Fla. Stat. 102.166 (2001) (foreseeing manual recounts during the protest period), &quot;with&quot; 102.111 (setting what is arguably too short a deadline for manual recounts to be conducted); compare 102.112(1) (stating that the Secretary &quot;may&quot; ignore late returns), &quot;with&quot; 102.111(1) (stating that the Secretary &quot;shall&quot; ignore late returns).

==Signals as verbs==
In footnotes, signals may function as verbs in sentences; this allows material which would otherwise be included in a parenthetical explanation to be integrated. When used in this manner, signals should not be italicized. &quot;See&quot; Christina L. Anderson, Comment, &quot;Double Jeopardy: The Modern Dilemma for Juvenile Justice&quot;, 152 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1181, 1204-07 (2004) (discussing four main types of restorative justice programs) becomes: See Christina L. Anderson, Comment, &quot;Double Jeopardy: The Modern Dilemma for Juvenile Justice&quot;, 152 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1181, 1204-07 (2004), for a discussion of restorative justice as a reasonable replacement for retributive sanctions. &quot;Cf.&quot; becomes &quot;compare&quot; and &quot;e.g.&quot; becomes &quot;for example&quot; when the signals are used as verbs.

==Formatting==

===Capitalization===
The first letter of a signal should be capitalized when it begins a citation sentence. If it is in a citation clause or sentence, it should not be capitalized.

===Placement and typeface===
One space should separate an introductory signal from the rest of the citation, with no punctuation between. For example, &quot;See&quot; &quot;American Trucking Associations v. United States EPA&quot;, 195 F.3d 4 (D.C. Cir. 1999).

Do not italicize a signal used as a verb; for example, for a discussion of the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s failure to interpret a statute to provide intelligible principles, see &quot;American Trucking Associations v. United States EPA,&quot; 195 F.3d 4 (D.C. Cir. 1999).

===Order===
When one or more signals are used, the signals should appear in the following order:
*Introductory signals
** No signal
** e.g.,
** Accord
** See
** See also
** Cf.
*Signals indicating comparison
** Compare
* Signals indicating contradiction
** Contra
** But see
** But cf.
* Signal indicating background material
** See generally

When multiple signals are used, they must be consistent with this order. Signals of the same basic type - supportive, comparative, contradictory or background - are strung together in a single citation sentence, separated by semicolons. Signals of different types should be grouped in different citation sentences. For example:

&quot;&quot;See&quot; &quot;Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia&quot;, 427 U.S. 307 (1976) (&quot;per curiam&quot;); &quot;cf.&quot; Palmer v. Ticcione, 433 F.Supp. 653 (E.D.N.Y 1977) (upholding a mandatory retirement age for kindergarten teachers). &quot;But see&quot; Gault v. Garrison, 569 F.2d 993 (7th Cir. 1977) (holding that a classification of public school teachers based on age violated equal protection absent a showing of justifiable and rational state purpose). &quot;See generally&quot; Comment, &quot;O&#x27;Neill v. Baine&quot;: &quot;Application of Middle-Level Scrutiny to Old-Age Classifications&quot;, 127 U. Pa. L. Rev. 798 (1979) (advocating a new constitutional approach to old-age classifications).&quot;

When &quot;e.g.&quot; is combined with another signal, the placement of the combined signal is determined by the non-&quot;e.g.&quot; signal; the combined signal &quot;&quot;see, e.g.&quot; should be placed where the &quot;see&quot;&quot; signal would normally be. In a citation clause, citation strings may contain different types of signals; these signals are separated by semicolons.

===Order of authorities===
Authorities in a signal are separated by semicolons. If an authority is more helpful or authoritative than others cited in a signal, it should precede them. Otherwise, authorities are cited in the following order:
*Constitutions and other foundation documents
#Federal
#State (alphabetically by name)
#Foreign (alphabetically by jurisdiction)
#Foundation documents of the United Nations, the League of Nations and the European Union (in that order). Constitutions of the same jurisdiction are cited in reverse chronological order.
*Statutes
#Federal: Statutes in U.S.C., U.S.C.A., or U.S.C.S.; other statutes currently in force, by reverse chronological order of enactment; rules of evidence and procedure and repealed statutes (by reverse chronological order of enactment)
#State (alphabetically by state): Statutes in the current code, by order in the code; statutes in force but not in the current code, by order in the code; rules of evidence and procedure, and repealed statutes (by reverse chronological order of enactment)
#Foreign (alphabetically by jurisdiction): Codes or statutes in the current code, by order in the code; statutes in force but not in the current code, by reverse chronological order of enactment, and repealed statutes (by reverse chronological order of enactment)
#Treaties and other international agreements, other than the foundation documents of the UN, League of Nations, and the EU: cite in reverse chronological order.
*Cases: Cases decided by the same court are arranged in reverse chronological order; all U.S. circuit courts of appeals are treated as one court, and all federal district courts are treated as one court. Cite cases in the following order, in the order of federal, state, foreign, and international:
#Federal:
##Supreme Court
##Court of Appeals, Emergency Court of Appeals and Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals
##Court of Claims, Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and bankruptcy appeals panels
##District courts, Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation and Court of International Trade 
##District bankruptcy courts and the Railroad Reorganization Court
##Court of Federal Claims, Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and Tax Court
##Administrative agencies, alphabetically by agency
#State
##Courts, alphabetically by state and then by rank within each state
##Agencies, alphabetically by state and then alphabetically by agency within states
#Foreign
##Courts, alphabetically by jurisdiction and then by rank within each jurisdiction
##Agencies, alphabetically by jurisdiction and then alphabetically by agency within each jurisdiction
#International
##International Court of Justice, Permanent Court of International Justice
##Other international tribunals and arbitration panels, alphabetically by name
*Legislative materials: Cite in the following order: bills and resolutions, committee hearings, reports, documents, and committee prints, floor debates (in reverse chronological order)
*Administrative and executive materials: Cite in the following order: federal (Executive Orders, current Treasury Regulations, other regulations in force, proposed rules not in force, repealed materials), state (alphabetically by state) and foreign (alphabetically by jurisdiction)
*Resolutions, decisions, and regulations of intergovernmental organizations: Cite in the following order: UN and League of Nations (General Assembly, then Security Council, then other organs in alphabetical order) and other organizations (alphabetically by name of organization)
*Records, briefs, and petitions, cited in that order
*Secondary materials: Cite in the following order: uniform codes, model codes and restatements (in reverse chronological order by category); books and pamphlets, works in journals, book reviews not written by students, student-written law-review materials, annotations, magazine and newspaper articles, working papers, unpublished materials and electronic sources (including Internet sources). For all secondary sources except codes and restatements, cite alphabetically by last name of author; if none, by first word of title.
*Cross-references to the author&#x27;s own material in text or footnotes; for example: See Arnold v. Runnels, 421 F.3d 859, 866 n. 8 (9th Cir.2005); &quot;United States v. Soliz&quot;, 129 F.3d 499, 504 n. 3 (1997), overruled on other grounds by &quot;United States v. Johnson&quot;, 256 F.3d 895 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (per curiam); &quot;Evans v. Demosthenes&quot;, 98 F.3d 1174, 1176 (9th Cir.1996).

===Parenthetical information===
Parentheticals, as needed, explain the relevance of an authority to the proposition in the text. Parenthetical information is recommended when the relevance of a cited authority might not otherwise be clear to the reader. Explanatory information takes the form of a present-participle phrase, a quoted sentence or a short statement appropriate in context. Unlike the other signals, it immediately follows the full citation. Usually brief (about one sentence), it quickly explains how the citation supports or disagrees with the proposition. For example: &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (overruling &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, 163 U.S. 537 (1896)).

===Phrases not quoting an authority===
Explanatory parenthetical phrases not directly quoting the authority usually begin with a present participle and should not begin with a capital letter: &quot;See generally&quot; John Copeland Nagle &amp; J.B. Ruhl, &quot;The Law of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Management&quot; 227-45 (2002) (detailing the ESA&#x27;s prohibition on the possession of protected species). When a complete participial phrase is unnecessary in context, a shorter parenthetical may be substituted:
Such standards have been adopted to address a variety of environmental problems. &quot;See, e.g.&quot;, H.B. Jacobini, &quot;The New International Sanitary Regulations&quot;, 46 Am. J. INT&#x27;L L. 727, 727-28(1952) (health-related water quality); Robert L. Meyer, Travaux Preparatoires &quot;for the UNESCO World Heritage Convention&quot;, 2 EARTH L.J. 45, 45-81 (1976)(conservation of protected areas).

===Phrases quoting an authority===
If the parenthetical quotes one or more full sentences, it begins with a capital letter and ends with punctuation: &quot;See&quot; Committee Note to Interim Rule 8001(f) (&quot;Given the short time limit to file the petition with the circuit clerk, subdivision (f)(1) provides that entry of a certification on the docket does not occur until an effective appeal is taken under Rule 8003(a) or (b).&quot;). Insert a space before the opening parenthesis of the explanatory parenthetical. If the parenthetical does not contain a complete sentence, the writer should not place final punctuation (such as a period) inside it.

Place a parenthetical included as part of a citation before an explanatory parenthetical:
Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(1) (emphasis added) (also indicating that &quot;[a] party may instruct a deponent not to answer . . . when necessary to preserve a privilege&quot;). Shorter parenthetical phrases may be used if a complete participial phrase is unnecessary in the context of the citation: The Florida Supreme court recently declared that &quot;where the seller of a home knows facts materially affecting the value of the property which are not readily observable and are not known to the buyer, the seller is under a duty to disclose them to the buyer.&quot; &quot;Johnson v. Davis&quot;, 480 So. 2d 625, 629 (Fla. 1985) (defective roof in three-year-old home). If a source directly quotes or supports an argument (no signal or &quot;see&quot; before a citation), no parenthetical is necessary.

===Order in a citation===
If a cited case has subsequent history or other relevant authority, it follows the parenthetical: &quot;Anderson v. Terhune&quot;, 467 F.3d 1208 (9th Cir.2006) (claiming that a police officer&#x27;s continued questioning violated due process rights), &quot;rehearing en banc granted&quot;, 486 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir.2007).

===Internal cross-references===
Portions of text, footnotes, and groups of authorities within the piece are cited with &quot;supra&quot; or &quot;infra&quot;. &quot;Supra&quot; refers to material already in the piece, and &quot;infra&quot; to material appearing later in the piece. &quot;Note&quot; and &quot;Part&quot; refer to footnotes and parts (when parts are specifically designed) in the same piece; &quot;p.&quot; and &quot;pp.&quot; are used to refer to other pages in the same piece. These abbreviations should be used sparingly to avoid repeating a lengthy footnote or to cross-reference a nearby footnote.

<doc id="74117" wikidata="Q192883" url="?curid=74117" title="Dauphin of France">
<text>Dauphin of France (, ; ), originally Dauphin of Viennois (&quot;Dauphin de Viennois&quot;), was the title given to the heir apparent to the throne of France from 1350 to 1791, and from 1824 to 1830. The word &quot;dauphin&quot; is French for dolphin and was the hereditary title of the ruler of the Dauphiné of Viennois. While early heirs were granted these lands to rule, eventually only the title was granted.

==History==

Guigues IV, Count of Vienne, had a dolphin on his coat of arms and was nicknamed &quot;le Dauphin&quot;. The title of Dauphin de Viennois descended in his family until 1349, when Humbert II sold his seigneury, called the Dauphiné, to King Philippe VI on condition that the heir of France assume the title of &quot;le Dauphin&quot;. The wife of the Dauphin was known as &quot;la Dauphine&quot;.

The first French prince called &quot;le Dauphin&quot; was Charles the Wise, later ascending to the throne as Charles V of France. The title was roughly equivalent to the Spanish &quot;Prince of Asturias&quot;, the Portuguese &quot;Prince of Brazil&quot;, the English (thence British) &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, and the Scottish &quot;Duke of Rothesay&quot;. The official style of a Dauphin of France, prior to 1461, was &quot;par la grâce de Dieu, dauphin de Viennois, comte de Valentinois et de Diois&quot; (&quot;By the Grace of God, Dauphin of Viennois, Count of Valentinois and of Diois&quot;). A Dauphin of France united the coat of arms of the Dauphiné, which featured dolphins, with the French fleurs-de-lis, and might, where appropriate, further unite that with other arms (e.g. Francis, son of Francis I, was ruling Duke of Brittany, so united the arms of that province with the typical arms of a Dauphin; Francis II, while Dauphin, was also King of Scots by marriage to Mary I, and added the arms of the Kingdom of Scotland to those of the Dauphin).

Originally the Dauphin was personally responsible for the rule of the Dauphiné, which was legally part of the Holy Roman Empire, and which the emperors, in giving the rule of the province to the French heirs, had stipulated must never be united with France. Because of this, the Dauphiné suffered from anarchy in the 14th and 15th centuries, since the Dauphins were frequently minors or concerned with other matters.

During his period as Dauphin, Louis, son of Charles VII, defied his father by remaining in the province longer than the king permitted and by engaging in personal politics more beneficial to the Dauphiné than to France. For example, he married Charlotte of Savoy against his father&#x27;s wishes. Savoy was a traditional ally of the Dauphiné, and Louis wished to reaffirm that alliance to stamp out rebels and robbers in the province. Louis was driven out of the Dauphiné by Charles VII&#x27;s soldiers in 1456, leaving the region to fall back into disorder. After his succession as Louis XI of France in 1461, Louis united the Dauphiné with France, bringing it under royal control.

The title was automatically conferred upon the next heir apparent to the throne in the direct line upon birth, accession of the parent to the throne or death of the previous Dauphin, unlike the British title &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, which has always been in the gift of the monarch (traditionally conferred upon the heir&#x27;s 21st birthday).

The sons of the King of France held the style and rank of &quot;fils de France&quot; (son of France), while male-line grandsons were given the style and rank of &quot;petits-enfants de France&quot; (Grandson of France). The sons and grandsons of the Dauphin ranked higher than their cousins, being treated as the king&#x27;s children and grandchildren respectively. The sons of the Dauphin, though grandsons of the king, were ranked as Sons of France, and the grandsons of the Dauphin ranked as Grandsons of France; other great-grandsons of the king ranked merely as princes of the blood.

The title was abolished by the Constitution of 1791, which made France a constitutional monarchy. Under the constitution the heir-apparent to the throne (Dauphin Louis-Charles at that time) was restyled &quot;Prince Royal&quot; (a &quot;Prince of the Blood&quot; retitled &quot;prince français&quot;), taking effect from the inception of the Legislative Assembly on 1 October 1791. The title was restored &quot;in potentia&quot; under the Bourbon Restoration of Louis XVIII, but there would not be another Dauphin until after his death. With the accession of his brother Charles X, Charles&#x27; son and heir Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoulême automatically became Dauphin.

With the removal of the Bourbons the title fell into disuse, the heirs of Louis-Philippe being titled &quot;Prince Royal&quot;. After the death of Henri, comte de Chambord, Carlos, Duke of Madrid, the heir of the legitimist claimant, Juan, Count of Montizón, made use of the title in pretense, as have the Spanish legitimist claimants since.

==In literature==

In Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, Huck encounters two odd characters who turn out to be professional con men. One of them claims that he should be treated with deference, since he is &quot;really&quot; an impoverished English duke, and the other, not to be outdone, reveals that he is &quot;really&quot; the Dauphin &quot;Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonet&quot;.

Louis, Duke of Guyenne, the Dauphin of Viennois, is a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;.

In Baroness Emma Orczy&#x27;s &quot;Eldorado&quot;, the Scarlet Pimpernel rescues the Dauphin from prison and helps spirit him from France.

Alphonse Daudet wrote a short story called &quot;The Death of the Dauphin&quot;, about a young Dauphin who wants to stop Death from approaching him.

The Dauphin is also mentioned in Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;.

&quot;The Dauphin&quot; is a 1988 episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. As the titular character is female, the episode title gets the gender incorrect (the French female equivalent is &quot;Dauphine&quot;).

Robert Pattinson portrays the Dauphin of Viennois in &quot;The King&quot;.

<doc id="74130" wikidata="Q73086" url="?curid=74130" title="Christy Mathewson">
<text>Christopher Mathewson (August 12, 1880 – October 7, 1925), nicknamed &quot;Big Six&quot;, &quot;the Christian Gentleman&quot;, &quot;Matty&quot;, and &quot;the Gentleman&#x27;s Hurler&quot;, was an American professional baseball pitcher who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball for the New York Giants. He stood tall and weighed . He was among the most dominant pitchers in baseball history, and ranks in the all-time top 10 in several key pitching categories, including wins, shutouts, and earned run average. In 1936, Mathewson was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its first five members.

Mathewson grew up in Factoryville, Pennsylvania, and began playing semiprofessional baseball when he was 14 years old. He played in the minor leagues in 1899, recording a record of 21 wins and two losses. He pitched for the Giants the next season, but was sent back to the minors. He eventually returned to the Giants and went on to win a National League record 373 career games, tying Grover Cleveland Alexander for the third-most career wins of all time. He led the Giants to the franchise&#x27;s first World Series championship in 1905 by pitching a single World Series record three shutouts. He also holds the record for career shutouts in the World Series, with four. Mathewson never pitched on Sundays, owing to his Christian beliefs. Mathewson served in the United States Army&#x27;s Chemical Warfare Service in World War I, and was accidentally exposed to chemical weapons during training. His respiratory system was weakened from the exposure, causing him to contract tuberculosis, from which he died in Saranac Lake, New York, in 1925.

==Early life==
Mathewson was born in Factoryville, Pennsylvania on August 12, 1880, and attended high school at Keystone Academy.

==College career==
He attended college at Bucknell University, where he served as class president and played on the school&#x27;s football, basketball, and baseball teams. Mathewson was also a member of the fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta. His first experience of semi-professional baseball came in 1895, when he was just 14 years old. The manager of the Factoryville ball club asked Mathewson to pitch in a game with a rival team in Mill City, Pennsylvania. Mathewson helped his hometown team to a 19–17 victory, but with his batting rather than his pitching. He continued to play baseball during his years at Bucknell, pitching for minor league teams in Honesdale and Meridian, Pennsylvania. Mathewson was selected to the Walter Camp All-American football team in 1900. He was a drop-kicker.

==Professional football career==
Mathewson played football at Keystone Academy from 1895 to 1897. He turned pro in 1898, appearing as a fullback with the Greensburg Athletic Association. While a member of the New York Giants, Mathewson played fullback for the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League. However, Mathewson disappeared from the team in the middle of the team&#x27;s 1902 season. Some historians speculate that the Giants got word that their star pitcher was risking his baseball career for the Stars and ordered him to stop, while others feel that the Stars&#x27; coach, Willis Richardson, got rid of Mathewson because he felt that, since the fullback&#x27;s punting skills were hardly used, he could replace him with a local player, Shirley Ellis.

==Professional baseball career==
===Minor leagues===

In 1899, Mathewson signed to play professional baseball with Taunton Herrings of the New England League, where he finished with a record of 2–13. The next season, he moved on to play on the Norfolk Phenoms of the Virginia League. He finished that season with a 20–2 record. He continued to attend Bucknell during that time.

===New York Giants (1900–1916)===
In July 1900, the New York Giants purchased his contract from Norfolk for $1,500 (). Between July and September 1900, Mathewson appeared in six games for the Giants. He started one of those games and compiled a 0–3 record. Displeased with his performance, the Giants returned him to Norfolk and demanded their money back. Later that month, the Cincinnati Reds picked up Mathewson off the Norfolk roster. On December 15, 1900, the Reds quickly traded Mathewson back to the Giants for Amos Rusie.
During his 17-year career, Mathewson won 373 games and lost 188 for a .665 winning percentage. His career earned run average of 2.13 and 79 career shutouts are among the best all time for pitchers, and his 373 wins are still number one in the National League, tied with Grover Cleveland Alexander. He employed a good fastball, outstanding control, and, especially a new pitch he termed the &quot;fadeaway&quot; (later known in baseball as the &quot;screwball&quot;), which he learned from teammate Dave Williams in 1898.

This reference is challenged by Ken Burns documentary &quot;Baseball&quot; in which it is stated that Mathewson learned his &quot;fadeaway&quot; from Andrew &quot;Rube&quot; Foster when New York Giants manager John McGraw quietly hired Rube to show the Giants bullpen what he knew. Many baseball historians consider this story apocryphal.

Mathewson recorded 2,507 career strikeouts against only 848 walks. He is famous for his 25 pitching duels with Mordecai &quot;Three Finger&quot; Brown, who won 13 of the duels against Mathewson&#x27;s 11, with one no-decision.

Mathewson was a very good-hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .215 batting average (362-for-1687) with
151 runs, seven home runs, and 167 runs batted in. In 10 of his 17 years in the majors, he was in double figures in runs batted in, with a season-high of 20 in 1903. He batted .281 (9-for-32) in 11 World Series games.

By 1903, Mathewson&#x27;s stature was such that when he briefly signed a contract with the St. Louis Browns of the American League, he was thought to be the spark the Browns needed to win the pennant. The Browns had finished a strong second in 1902, five games behind the Philadelphia Athletics. They offered him four times what he was making with the Giants. However, as part of the settlement that ended the two-year war between the American and National Leagues, Mathewson and Browns owner Robert Lee Hedges tore up the contract. Hedges later said that ensuring the return of peace to the game was more important, even if it meant effectively giving up a pennant.

From 1900 to 1904, Mathewson established himself as a premier pitcher. Posting low earned run averages and winning nearly 100 games, Mathewson helped lead the Giants to their first National League title in 1903, and a berth in first World Series. Though no World Series was held in 1904, the Giants captured the pennant, prompting McGraw to proclaim them as the best team in the world.

Mathewson strove even harder in 1905. After switching to catcher, Roger Bresnahan had begun collaborating with Mathewson, whose advanced memory of hitter weaknesses paved the way for a historic season. Pinpoint control guided Mathewson&#x27;s pitches to Bresnahan&#x27;s glove. In 338 innings, Mathewson walked only 64 batters. He shut out opposing teams eight times, pitching entire games in brief 90-minute sessions. Besides winning 31 games, Mathewson recorded an earned run average of 1.28 and 206 strikeouts. He led the National League in all three categories, earning him the Triple Crown.

Mathewson&#x27;s Giants won the 1905 World Series over the Philadelphia Athletics. Mathewson was the starting pitcher in game one, and pitched a four-hit shutout for the victory. Three days later, with the series tied 1–1, he pitched another four-hit shutout. Then, two days later in game five, he threw a six-hit shutout to clinch the series for the Giants. In a span of only six days, Mathewson had pitched three complete games without allowing a run, while giving up only 14 hits.

The next year, Mathewson lost much of his edge, owing to an early-season diagnosis of diphtheria. McGraw pulled over 260 innings from him, but these were plagued with struggle. Though he maintained a 22–12 record, his 2.97 earned run average was well above the league average of 2.62. His 1.271 walks plus hits per innings pitched, quite uncharacteristic of him, was due to an increased number of hits and walks.
By 1908, Mathewson was back on top as the league&#x27;s elite pitcher. Winning the most games of his career, 37, coupled with a 1.43 earned run average and 259 strikeouts, he claimed a second triple crown. He also led the league in starts, innings pitched, complete games, and shutouts, and held hitters to an exceptionally low 0.827 walks plus hits per innings pitched. He even led the league in saves, racking up 5 of them in 12 relief appearances. Unfortunately, the Giants were unable to take home the pennant due to what was ultimately known as Merkle&#x27;s Boner, an incident that cost the Giants a crucial game against the Chicago Cubs, who eventually defeated the Giants in the standings by one game.

Mathewson returned for an outstanding 1909 season; though not as dominant as the previous year, he posted a better earned run average (1.14), and a record of 25–6. He repeated a strong performance in 1910 and then again in 1911, when the Giants captured their first pennant since 1905. The Giants ultimately lost the 1911 World Series to the Philadelphia Athletics, the same team they had defeated for the 1905 championship. Mathewson and Rube Marquard allowed two game-winning home runs to Hall of Famer Frank Baker, earning him the nickname, &quot;Home Run&quot;. Mathewson, the team&#x27;s &quot;star pitcher&quot;, signed a three-year contract with the Giants in late 1910, for the upcoming 1911, 1912 and 1913 seasons, the first time he had signed a contract over a year in length.

In 1912, Mathewson gave another stellar performance. Capturing the pennant, the Giants were fueled by the stolen-base game and a superior pitching staff capped by Rube Marquard, the &quot;11,000-dollar lemon&quot; who turned around to win 26 games, 19 of them consecutively. In the 1912 World Series, the Giants faced the Boston Red Sox, the 1904 American League pennant winners who would have faced the Giants in the World Series that year had one been played. Though Mathewson threw three complete games and maintained an earned run average below 1.00, numerous errors by the Giants, including a lazy popup dropped by Fred Snodgrass in the eighth game (Game 2 was a tie), cost them the championship. The Giants also lost the 1913 World Series, a 101-win season cemented by Mathewson&#x27;s final brilliant season on the mound: a league-leading 2.06 earned run average in over 300 innings pitched complemented by 0.6 bases on balls per nine innings pitched.

For the remainder of his career with the Giants, Mathewson began to struggle. Soon, the former champions fell into decline. In 1915, Mathewson&#x27;s penultimate season in New York, the Giants were the worst team in the National League standings. Mathewson, who had expressed interest in serving as a manager, wound up with a three-year deal to manage the Cincinnati Reds effective July 21, 1916.

==Managerial career==
===Cincinnati Reds (1916–1918)===

On July 20, 1916, Mathewson&#x27;s career came full circle when he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds along with Edd Roush. He was immediately named as the Reds&#x27; player-manager. However, for all intents and purposes, his playing career was over. He appeared in only one game as a pitcher for the Reds, on September 4, 1916. He faced Brown in the second half of a doubleheader, which was billed as the final meeting between the two old baseball warriors. The high-scoring game was a win for Mathewson&#x27;s Reds over Brown&#x27;s Cubs, 10–8.

Mathewson retired as a player after the season and managed the Reds for the entire 1917 season and the first 118 games of 1918, compiling a total record of 164–176 as a manager.

==Personal life and literary career==
Mathewson married Jane Stoughton (1880–1967) in 1903. Their only son, Christopher Jr., was born shortly after. Christy Mathewson Jr. served in World War II, and died in an explosion at his home in Texas on August 16, 1950. During Mathewson&#x27;s playing years, the family lived in a duplex on the Upper West Side, at Columbus and 85th, alongside Mathewson&#x27;s manager John McGraw and his wife Blanche. Mathewson and McGraw remained friends for the rest of their lives. In the 1909 offseason, Christy Mathewson&#x27;s younger brother Nicholas Mathewson died by suicide in a neighbor&#x27;s barn. Another brother, Henry Mathewson, pitched briefly for the Giants before dying of tuberculosis in 1917.
Mathewson was highly regarded in the baseball world during his lifetime. As he was a clean-cut, intellectual collegiate, his rise to fame brought a better name to the typical ballplayer, who usually spent his time gambling, boozing, or womanizing. As noted in &quot;The National League Story&quot; (1961) by Lee Allen, Mathewson was a devout Christian and never pitched on Sunday, a promise he made to his mother that brought him popularity among the more religious New York fans and earned him the nickname &quot;The Christian Gentleman&quot;. However, the impact of this practice on the Giants was minimized, since, in the eight-team National League, only the Chicago Cubs (Illinois), Cincinnati Reds (Ohio), and St. Louis Cardinals (Missouri) played home games in states that allowed professional sports on Sunday.

In his free time, Mathewson enjoyed nature walks, reading, golf, and checkers, of which he was a renowned champion player. The combination of athletic skill and intellectual hobbies made him a favorite for many fans, even those opposed to the Giants. Sportswriters praised him, and in his prime every game he started began with deafening cheers. Sometimes, the distraction prompted him to walk out 10 minutes after his fielders took the field. Mathewson soon became the unspoken captain of the Giants.

He was the only player to whom John McGraw ever gave full discretion. McGraw told many younger players to watch and listen to his wisdom.

Mathewson garnered respect throughout the baseball world as a pitcher of great sportsmanship. He was often asked to write columns concerning upcoming games. In 1912, with the editing and ghostwriting aid of sportswriter John Wheeler, Mathewson published his classic memoir &quot;Pitching in a Pinch,&quot; or Pitching from the Inside, which was admired by poet Marianne Moore and is still in print. Years later, Mathewson co-wrote a mildly successful play called &quot;The Girl and The Pennant&quot;, which was inspired by Helene Hathaway Britton&#x27;s ownership of the St. Louis Cardinals. Mathewson went on to pursue more literary endeavors ending in 1917 with a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Second Base Sloan&quot;.

One of the journalists to unmask the 1919 Black Sox, Hugh Fullerton, consulted Mathewson for information about baseball gambling. Fullerton trusted Mathewson for his writing intellect, as well as his unbiased standpoint. As a player and manager, Mathewson also had several seasons of experience playing alongside Hal Chase, a veteran major league player widely rumored to have been involved in several gambling incidents and attempts to fix games.

Representing the only former ballplayer among the group of investigating journalists, Mathewson played a small role in Fullerton&#x27;s exposure of the 1919 World Series scandal.

==World War I and afterward==
Late in the 1918 season, Mathewson enlisted in the United States Army during World War I. His wife Jane was very much opposed to the decision, but Mathewson insisted on going. He served overseas as a captain in the newly formed Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) along with Ty Cobb. Mathewson served with the American Expeditionary Forces until February 1919 and was discharged later that month.

Mathewson developed tuberculosis shortly after his military service. It was widely assumed his disease was caused by his work with the chemical warfare service, largely due to the conventional wisdom that tuberculosis more easily infects lungs that have been damaged by chemical gases. This narrative was given further credence from a passage in Al Stump&#x27;s 1961 biography of Ty Cobb, which says that Cobb and Mathewson were both accidentally gassed during a chemical training exercise in Choignes, France where eight men died; Mathewson purportedly told Cobb afterwards that he had &#x27;got a good dose of that stuff. I feel terrible.&#x27; This account has widely been accepted as true, although it is not without its detractors: Branch Rickey, who also served in the CWS alongside Mathewson, flatly denied the incident; other historians have noted that Stump&#x27;s book, published after Cobb&#x27;s death, is sensationalized and generally unreliable. Some historians question whether the incident ever occurred. Mathewson himself never mentioned a training accident during his lifetime, but he acknowledged that he had inhaled lethal gases on various occasions while demonstrating gas shells to students: &quot;We were careful, but there is no doubt the accumulated gases affected my lungs,&quot; he later said.

Although he returned to serve as a coach for the Giants from 1919 to 1921, he spent a good portion of that time in Saranac Lake fighting the tuberculosis, initially at the Trudeau Sanitorium, and later in a house that he had built. In 1923, Mathewson returned to professional baseball when Giants attorney Emil Fuchs and he put together a syndicate that bought the Boston Braves. Although initial plans called for Mathewson to be principal owner and team president, his health had deteriorated so much that he could perform only nominal duties. He turned over the presidency to Fuchs after the season.

==Death and legacy==
After contracting tuberculosis, Mathewson moved to the frigid climate of Saranac Lake, New York, in the Adirondack Mountains, where he sought treatment from Edward Livingston Trudeau at his renowned Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium. He died in Saranac Lake of tuberculosis on October 7, 1925. Mathewson is buried at Lewisburg Cemetery in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Bucknell University. Members of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Washington Senators wore black armbands during the 1925 World Series. Mathewson had died on the day the series began, October 7. According to &quot;Baseball&quot;, some of Mathewson&#x27;s last words were to his wife: &quot;Now Jane, I want you to go outside and have yourself a good cry. Don&#x27;t make it a long one; this can&#x27;t be helped.&quot;

<doc id="74133" wikidata="Q3547325" url="?curid=74133" title="Adding machine">
<text>An adding machine is a class of mechanical calculator, usually specialized for bookkeeping calculations.
In the United States, the earliest adding machines were usually built to read in dollars and cents. Adding machines were ubiquitous office equipment until they were phased out in favor of electronic calculators in the 1970s and by personal computers beginning in about 1985. The older adding machines were rarely seen in American office settings by the year 2000.

Blaise Pascal and Wilhelm Schickard were the two original inventors of the mechanical calculator in 1642. For Pascal, this was an adding machine that could perform additions and subtractions directly and multiplication and divisions by repetitions, while Schickard&#x27;s machine, invented several decades earlier, was less functionally efficient but was supported by a mechanised form of multiplication tables. These two were followed by a series of inventors and inventions leading to those of Thomas de Colmar, who launched the mechanical calculator industry in 1851 when he released his simplified arithmometer (it took him thirty years to refine his machine, patented in 1820, into a simpler and more reliable form). However, they did not gain widespread use until Dorr E. Felt started manufacturing his comptometer (1887) and Burroughs started the commercialization of differently conceived adding machines (1892).

==Operation==

To add a new list of numbers and arrive at a total, the user was first required to &quot;ZERO&quot; the machine. Then, to add sets of numbers, the user was required to press numbered keys on a keyboard, which would remain depressed (rather than immediately rebound like the keys of a computer keyboard or typewriter or the buttons of a typical modern machine). The user would then pull the crank, which caused the numbers to be shown on the rotary wheels, and the keys to be released (i.e. to pop back up) in preparation for the next input. To add, for example, the amounts of 30.72 and 4.49 (which, in adding machine terms, on a decimal adding machine is 3,072 plus 449 &quot;decimal units&quot;), the following process took place: Press the key in the column fourth from the right (multiples of one thousand), the key in the column second from right (multiples of ten) and the key in the rightmost column (multiples of 1). Pull the crank. The rotary wheels now showed 3072. Press the key in the third column from the right, the key in the second column from right, and the key in the rightmost column. Pull the crank. The rotary wheels now show a running &#x27;total&#x27; of 3521 which, when interpreted using the decimal currency colour-coding of the key columns, equates to 35.21. Keyboards typically did not have or need (zero) keys; one simply did not press any key in the column containing a zero. Trailing zeros (those to the right of a number), were there by default because when a machine was zeroed, all numbers visible on the rotary wheels were reset to zero. 

Subtraction was impossible, except by adding the complement of a number (for instance, subtract 2.50 by adding 9,997.50).

Multiplication was a simple process of keying in the numbers one or more columns to the left and repeating the &quot;addition&quot; process. For example, to multiply 34.72 by 102, key in 3472, pull crank, repeat once more. Wheels show 6944. Key in 3472(00), pull crank. Wheels now show 354144, or 3,541.44.

A later adding machine, called the comptometer, did not require that a crank be pulled to add. Numbers were input simply by pressing keys. The machine was thus driven by finger power. Multiplication was similar to that on the adding machine, but users would &quot;form&quot; up their fingers over the keys to be pressed and press them down the multiple of times required. Using the above example, four fingers would be used to press down twice on the (fourth column), (third column), (second column) and (first column) keys. That finger shape would then move left two columns and press once. Usually a small crank near the wheels would be used to zero them. Subtraction was possible by adding complementary numbers; keys would also carry a smaller, complementary digit to help the user form complementary numbers. Division was also possible by putting the dividend to the left end and performing repeated subtractions by using the complementary method.

Some adding machines were electromechanical – an old-style mechanism, but driven by electric power.

Some &quot;ten-key&quot; machines had input of numbers as on a modern calculator – 30.72 was input as , , , . These machines could subtract as well as add. Some could multiply and divide, although including these operations made the machine more complex. Those that could multiply, used a form of the old adding machine multiplication method. Using the previous example of multiplying 34.72 by 102, the amount was keyed in, then the 2 key in the &quot;multiplication&quot; key column was pressed. The machine cycled twice, then tabulated the adding mechanism below the keyboard one column to the right. The number keys remained locked down on the keyboard. The user now pressed the multiplication key which caused tabulation of the adding mechanism one more column to the right, but did not cycle the machine. Now the user pressed the multiplication key. The machine cycled once. To see the total the user was required to press a key and the machine would print the result on a paper tape, release the locked down keys, reset the adding mechanism to zero and tabulate it back to its home position.

Modern adding machines are like simple calculators. They often have a different input system, though.
:&quot;Note&quot;: Sometimes the adding machine will have a key labeled instead of . In this case, substitute for in the examples above. Alternatively, the plus key may continuously total instead of either a or key. Sometimes, the plus key is even labeled thus: 

==Burroughs&#x27;s calculating machine==

William Seward Burroughs received a patent for his adding machine on August 25, 1888. He was a founder of American Arithmometer Company, which became Burroughs Corporation and evolved to produce electronic billing machines and mainframes, and eventually merged with Sperry to form Unisys. The grandson of the inventor of the adding machine is Beat author William S. Burroughs; a collection of his essays is called &quot;The Adding Machine&quot;.

<text>The Northern and Southern dynasties () was a period of political division in the history of China that lasted from 420 to 589, following the tumultuous era of the Sixteen Kingdoms and the Eastern Jin dynasty. It is sometimes considered as the latter part of a longer period known as the Six Dynasties (220–589). The period featured civil war and political chaos, but was also a time of flourishing arts and culture, advancement in technology, and the spread of Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. The period saw large-scale migration of Han people to lands south of the Yangtze. The period came to an end with the unification of China proper by Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty.

During this period, the process of sinicization accelerated among the non-Han ethnicities in the north and among the indigenous peoples in the south. This process was also accompanied by the increasing popularity of Buddhism in both northern and southern China and Daoism gaining influence as well, with two essential Daoist canons written during this period. Notable technological advances occurred during this period. The invention of the stirrup during the earlier Jin dynasty (266–420) helped spur the development of heavy cavalry as a combat standard. Historians also note advances in medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and cartography. Intellectuals of the period include the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–500), and astronomer Tao Hongjing.

==Background==

After the collapse of a unified China proper under the Eastern Han dynasty in 220 due in large part to the Yellow Turban and the Five Pecks of Rice rebellions, China eventually coalesced into the Three Kingdoms. Of these, Cao Wei was the strongest, followed by Eastern Wu and Shu Han, but they were initially in a relatively stable formation. After a 249 coup by Sima Yi, the Sima family essentially controlled Cao Wei and the conquest of Shu Han by Cao Wei followed in late 263.

Following a failed coup by the ruling Cao family against the Sima family in June 260, the final Cao ruler abdicated in February 266. Sima Yan (Emperor Wu of Jin) then founded the Western Jin dynasty and the conquest of Eastern Wu by Western Jin occurred in 280, ending the Three Kingdoms period and reuniting China proper.

The Western Jin dynasty was severely weakened due to the War of the Eight Princes from 291 to 306. During the reigns of Emperor Huai of Jin and Emperor Min of Jin, the empire was put into grave danger by the uprising of northern non-Han peoples collectively known as the Five Barbarians. Numerous nomadic tribal groups had been forcibly resettled in northern and northwestern China during previous centuries. When the warring princes heavily drafted these tribes into the military, they mutinied and exploited the civil wars to seize power. Their armies almost destroyed the dynasty in the Disaster of Yongjia of 311, when the Five Barbarians sacked Luoyang. Chang&#x27;an met a similar fate in 316.

However, a scion of the imperial house, Sima Rui (Emperor Yuan of Jin) fled south of the Huai River and reestablished the dynasty, known in historiography as the Eastern Jin dynasty. Cementing their power in the south, the Eastern Jin established Jiankang on the existing site of Jianye (now Nanjing) as their new capital.

In the north, the Five Barbarians established numerous short-lived dynasties, leading to the period known as the Sixteen Kingdoms in historiography. Eventually, the Northern Wei dynasty conquered the rest of the northern states in 439 and unified northern China. Although the Eastern Jin and successive southern dynasties were well-defended from the northern dynasties by their placement of naval fleets along the Yangtze, they suffered various problems related to the creation and maintenance of military strength. The court&#x27;s designation of specific households for military service through the tuntian system eventually led to a fall in their social status, causing widespread desertion of troops. Faced with shortage of troops, Eastern Jin generals were often sent on campaigns to capture non-Han indigenous peoples in the south to draft them into the military. The Eastern Jin dynasty fell not because of external invasion, however, but because Liu Yu (Emperor Wu of Liu Song) seized the throne from the Emperor Gong of Jin and founded the Liu Song dynasty, which officially began the Northern and Southern dynasties period.

==Northern dynasties==
The Northern dynasties began in 439 when the Northern Wei conquered the Northern Liang to unite northern China and ended in 589 when the Sui dynasty extinguished the Chen dynasty. It can be divided into three time periods: Northern Wei; Eastern and Western Weis; Northern Qi and Northern Zhou. The Northern, Eastern, and Western Wei along with the Northern Zhou were established by the Xianbei people while the Northern Qi was established by a Xianbei-influenced ethnic Han.

In the north, local ethnic Han gentry clans responded to the chaos by constructing fortified villages. Clans would then carve de facto fiefs out of these highly cohesive family-based self-defense communities. Lesser peasant families would work for the dominant clan as tenants or serfs. The chaos also led these Han gentry families to avoid government service, before the Northern Wei court launched the sinicization movement. Northern gentry were therefore highly militarized as compared to their refined southern counterparts, and this distinction persisted well into the Sui and Tang dynasties centuries later.

===Northern Wei (386–535)===
====Rise to power====

In the Sixteen Kingdoms period, the Tuoba family of the Xianbei were the rulers of the state of Dai (Sixteen Kingdoms). Although it was conquered by the Former Qin, the defeat of the Former Qin at the Battle of Fei River resulted in the collapse of the Former Qin. The grandson of the last prince of Dai Tuoba Shiyiqian, Tuoba Gui restored the fortunes of the Tuoba clan, renaming his state Wei (now known as Northern Wei) with its capital at Shengle (near modern Hohhot). Under the rule of Emperors Daowu (Tuoba Gui), Mingyuan, and Taiwu, the Northern Wei progressively expanded. The establishment of the early Northern Wei state and the economy were also greatly indebted to the father-son pair of Cui Hong and Cui Hao. Tuoba Gui engaged in numerous conflicts with the Later Yan that ended favorably for the Northern Wei after they received help from Zhang Gun that allowed them to destroy the Later Yan army at the Battle of Canhe Slope. Following this victory, Tuoba Gui conquered the Later Yan capital of Pingcheng (modern-day Datong). That same year he declared himself Emperor Daowu.

Due to Emperor Daowu&#x27;s cruelty, he was killed by his son Tuoba Shao, but crown prince Tuoba Si managed to defeat Tuoba Shao and took the throne as Emperor Mingyuan. Though he managed to conquer Liu Song&#x27;s province of Henan, he died soon afterward. Emperor Mingyuan&#x27;s son Tuoba Tao took the throne as Emperor Taiwu. Due to Emperor Taiwu&#x27;s energetic efforts, Northern Wei&#x27;s strength greatly increased, allowing them to repeatedly attack Liu Song. After dealing with the Rouran threat to his northern flank, he engaged in a war to unite northern China. With the fall of the Northern Liang in 439, Emperor Taiwu united northern China, ending the Sixteen Kingdoms period and beginning the Northern and Southern dynasties period with their southern rivals, the Liu Song.
Even though it was a time of great military strength for the Northern Wei, Rouran harassment from the north forced them to divert their focus from their southern expeditions. After uniting the north, Emperor Taiwu also conquered the powerful Shanshan kingdom and subjugated the other kingdoms of &quot;Xiyu&quot; (Western Regions). In 450, Emperor Taiwu once again attacked the Liu Song and reached Guabu (瓜步, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), threatening to cross the river to attack Jiankang, the Liu Song capital. Though up to this point, the Northern Wei military forces dominated the Liu Song forces, they took heavy casualties. The Northern Wei forces plundered numerous households before returning north.

At this point, followers of the Buddhist Gai Wu () rebelled. After pacifying this rebellion, Emperor Taiwu, under the advice of his Daoist prime minister Cui Hao, proscribed Buddhism — the first of the persecutions of Chinese Buddhism known as the Three Disasters of Wu. At this late stage in his life, Emperor Taiwu meted out cruel punishments, which led to his death in 452 at the hands of the eunuch Zong Ai. His death sparked off turmoil that only ended with the ascension of Emperor Wencheng later that same year. , an ethnic Qiang court eunuch and the favourite of Empress Dowager Wenming, patronized Buddhism lavishly. He constructed Cave 9–10, the most highly decorated of the Yungang Grottoes, and had a temple constructed in 488 at Lirun, Fengyi (modern day Chengcheng), which was his birthplace according to the Booke of Wei. Wang Yu may have been castrated during the suppression of a 446 Qiang rebellion since the Northern Wei would castrate rebel tribes&#x27; young elite.

In the first half of the Northern Wei dynasty, the Xianbei steppe tribesmen who dominated northern China kept a policy of strict social distinction between them and their Han subjects. Ethnic Han were drafted into the bureaucracy, employed as officials to collect taxes, etc. However, the Han were kept out of many higher positions of power. They also represented the minority of the populace where centers of power were located.

====Sinicization====
Widespread social and cultural transformation in northern China came with Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei (reigned 471–499), whose father was a Xianbei, but whose mother was Han. Although of the Tuoba Clan from the Xianbei tribe, Emperor Xiaowen asserted his dual Xianbei-Han identity, renaming his own clan &quot;Yuan&quot; (). In the year 493 Emperor Xiaowen instituted a new sinification program that had the Xianbei elites conform to many Han standards. These social reforms included donning Han clothing (banning Xianbei clothing at court), learning the Han language (if under the age of thirty), converting Xianbei family names to one-character Han surnames, and encouraging high-ranking Xianbei and Han families to intermarry. Emperor Xiaowen also moved the capital city from Pingcheng to one of China&#x27;s old imperial sites, Luoyang, which had been the capital during the earlier Eastern Han and Western Jin dynasties. The new capital at Luoyang was revived and transformed, with roughly 150,000 Xianbei and other northern warriors moved from north to south by the year 495 to serve in the capital. Within a couple of decades, the population rose to about half a million residents and was famed for being home to over a thousand Buddhist temples. Defectors from the south, such as Wang Su of the prestigious Langye Wang family, were largely accommodated and felt at home with the establishment of their own Wu quarter in Luoyang (this quarter of the city was home to over three thousand families). They were even served tea (by this time gaining popularity in southern China) at court instead of the yogurt drinks commonly found in the north.

Beginning in the 480s, the Northern Wei arranged for Han elites to marry daughters of the Xianbei Tuoba imperial family. More than fifty per cent of Tuoba Xianbei princesses of the Northern Wei were married to southern Han men from the imperial families and aristocrats of the southern dynasties, who defected and moved north to join the Northern Wei. Several daughters of the Xianbei Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei married Han elites: the Liu Song royal Liu Hui (), married Princess Lanling () of the Northern Wei, Princess Huayang () to Sima Fei (), a descendant of Jin royalty, Princess Jinan () to Lu Daoqian (), and Princess Nanyang () to Xiao Baoyin, a member of Southern Qi royalty. Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei&#x27;s sister, the Shouyang Princess, was wedded to Emperor Wu of Liang&#x27;s son . According to the Book of Zhou, Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei&#x27;s sister was married to the ethnic Han Zhang Huan, son of Zhang Qiong. When the Eastern Jin dynasty ended, Northern Wei received the Jin prince as a refugee, and he married a Northern Wei Princess. Their son Sima Jinlong in turn married Northern Liang Xiongnu King Juqu Mujian&#x27;s daughter.

In the year 523, Prince Dongyang of the Northern Wei was sent to Dunhuang to serve as its governor for a term of fifteen years. With Buddhism gaining mainstream acceptance in Chinese society, Prince Dongyang and local wealthy families set out to establish a monumental project in honor of Buddhism, carving and decorating Cave 285 of the Mogao Caves with beautiful statues and murals. Such promotion of the arts would continue for centuries at Dunhuang and it is now one of China&#x27;s greatest tourist attractions.

===Split into Eastern Wei (534–550) and Western Wei (535–557)===
In the year 523, a revolt of several military garrisons broke out, the Rebellion of the Six Garrisons (&quot;Liu Zhen&quot;). The revolt was caused by a food shortage far north of Luoyang. After the rebels force was suppressed, the government had 200,000 surrendered garrison rebels deployed to Hebei, which proved later to be a mistake when a former garrison officer organized another rebellion in the years 526–527. The underlying cause of these wars was the growing rift between the governing aristocracy which was increasingly adopting Han-style sedentary policies and lifestyles and their nomadic tribal armies who continued to preserve the old steppe way of life.

The Northern Wei court was betrayed by one of their own generals, who had the empress dowager and the young emperor thrown into the Yellow River while establishing his own puppet ruler to maintain authority. As conflict swelled in the north between successive leaders, Gao Huan took control of the east and Luoyang (holding Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei as a puppet ruler) by 534, while his rival Yuwen Tai took control of the west and the traditional Chinese capital of Chang&#x27;an by 535. The Western regime was dominated by the sinicized nobles and their Han bureaucrats while the Eastern regime was controlled by the traditional steppe tribes.

===Northern Qi (550–577) and Northern Zhou (557–581)===
Eventually, Gao Huan&#x27;s son Gao Yang forced the Eastern Wei emperor to abdicate in favor of his claim to the throne, establishing the Northern Qi dynasty (551–577). Afterward, Yuwen Tai&#x27;s son Yuwen Jue seized the throne of power from Emperor Gong of Western Wei, establishing the Northern Zhou dynasty (557–580).

The Northern Qi inherited the primary recruiting grounds of the Northern Wei army; previously, five out of six Northern Wei military officers came from the eastern territories, particularly the local armed forts of Han military families and steppe tribes who had settled in these areas. The members of these military families, both men and women, were often expert riders and archers.

Like its predecessor the Western Wei, the Northern Zhou reacted against sinicization by trying to revive Xianbei warrior culture: reviving Xianbei tunics, trousers and boots, reverting sinicized surnames into Xianbei names and even giving Han officers Xianbei surnames. This &quot;tribalization&quot; policy was intended to convert large numbers of Han Chinese army recruits into &quot;Xianbei&quot; who would pay for their own equipment in exchange for tax exemptions. The policy was highly successful in boosting the state&#x27;s military strength.

The Northern Zhou dynasty was able to defeat and conquer Northern Qi in 577, reunifying the north. However, this success was short-lived, as the Northern Zhou was overthrown in 581 by Yang Jian, who became Emperor Wen of Sui.

With greater military power and morale, along with convincing propaganda that the Chen dynasty ruler Chen Shubao was a decadent ruler who had lost the Mandate of Heaven, the Sui Dynasty was able to effectively conquer the south. After this conquest, the whole of China entered a new golden age of reunification under the centralization of the short-lived Sui dynasty and the succeeding Tang dynasty (618–907).

The core elite of the Northern dynasties, mixed-culture, and mixed-ethnicity military clans, would later also form the founding elites of the Sui and Tang dynasties. Hence, they tended to have a flexible approach to steppe nomads, viewing them as possible partners rather than intrinsic enemies.

==Southern dynasties==
The Jin were succeeded by a series of short-lived dynasties: Liu Song (420–479), Southern Qi (479–502), Liang (502–557) and Chen (557–589). As all of these dynasties had their capital at Jiankang (except for a brief interlude from 552 to 555), they are sometimes grouped together with Eastern Wu and Eastern Jin under the historiographic term &quot;the Six Dynasties&quot;. The rulers of these short-lived dynasties were generals who seized and then held power for several decades but were unable to securely pass power of rule onto their heirs to continue their dynasty successfully. Emperor Wu of Liang (502–549) was the most notable ruler of his age, being a patron of the arts and of Buddhism.

The Southern dynasties, except for the last Chen dynasty, were strongly dominated by the &quot;shijia&quot;, the great families, who monopolized political power until the mid-6th century. This class was created by Cao Cao during the late Han dynasty when he attempted to consolidate his power by building an endogenous military caste of professional soldiers. His policy led to the rise and usurpation of the Sima family who established the Jin dynasty; subsequent leaders were similarly unable to bring the other great families in line. The Jin dynasty&#x27;s flight south greatly exacerbated the weakness of the central government, and the great families who accompanied the Emperor in his flight, along with the most wealthy clans of earlier settlers along the Zhejiang coast, were the primary power brokers in the Eastern Jin. With the greatly increased importance of proving one&#x27;s pedigree to receive privileges, there was a rise in compiling of genealogy records, and the great families moved to legally outlaw intermarriage with common families. The lower class Northern migrants were forced to become &quot;guests&quot; (dependents) of the great families who established private guard forces with their new retainers. When the Eastern Jin attempted to draft the dependents of the great families, the court was quickly overthrown.

However, with the fall of the Eastern Jin in 420, the balance of power shifted in favour the central government. The subsequent Liu Song, Qi, Liang and Chen dynasties were ruled by military leaders from lowly social backgrounds. They gradually stripped the powerful clans of military power, authority and wealth. The emperors stationed regional armies around the country under the command of their imperial relatives, recruited officers from humble backgrounds and appointed low-ranking officials to monitor the powerful elites occupying the top government posts. The southern aristocracy declined with the rise of the Indian Ocean trade in the mid 5th century, which led to the court revenues shifting to trade and the disappearance of the caste by the Chen dynasty. As landowning aristocrats were unable to convert cash from the produce of their estates, the resurgence of trade and the money-based economy forced them to break up and sell their lands to the burgeoning merchant class. Influential merchants increasingly occupied political offices, displacing the old aristocrats. On the other hand, the economic developments also drove peasants, unable to cope with inflation or to pay taxes in cash, to become mercenary soldiers, wandering through the country selling their services to the warring princes and plundering the populace. These upheavals devastated the south which eased the fall of the south to the Sui dynasty.

Under the later waning leadership of the Chen dynasty, the southern Chinese were unable to resist the military power amassed in the north by Yang Jian, who declared himself Emperor Wen of Sui and invaded the south.

Aboriginal chiefs played an important active role in adapting to the dominant Chinese structure, rather than being forcibly subjugated. For instance, the aboriginal chief Lady Xian who married the Liang court&#x27;s governor Feng Bao, helped to extend the dynasties&#x27; authority while preserving autonomy and local culture. Lady Xian and Feng Bao played a critical role in assisting Chen Baxian&#x27;s rise, and in stabilising the region between the Liang, Chen, and Sui dynasties. The court acknowledged her authority by awarding her with official titles and emblems of power. There were many other local chieftains of mixed origins between Guangzhou and modern Vietnam that displayed mixed traits of both aboriginal and sinicized culture, such as the Ning of Qinzhou, the Li of Guizhou-Tengzhou and the Chen of Shuangzhou. These families functioned both as cheftains to the natives and bureaucrats to the court.

===Liu Song (420–479)===
Liu Song founder Liu Yu was originally a leader of the Army of the Northern Garrison () that notably won the Battle of Fei River in 383. In 404, he helped suppress Huan Xuan&#x27;s rebellion, leading to his dominance over the Eastern Jin court. In order to gain popularity to take the throne he led expeditions against the Sixteen Kingdoms, capturing Shandong, Henan and, briefly, Guanzhong by 416. He gave up Guanzhong to try to take the throne. Because he believed in a prophecy saying there would be one more emperor after Emperor An, he deposed him and, soon afterwards, his replacement, Emperor Gong, in 420, ending the Eastern Jin dynasty.

Even after crowning himself Emperor Wu, Liu Yu remained frugal. However, he did not care for education and trusted unsavory people. He felt that the nobility had too much power, so he tended to appoint the lower classes to government positions and gave military power to imperial kinsmen. Ironically, because the imperial kinsmen stabilized their military power and wished to gain political power, Emperor Wu was afraid they would have thoughts of usurping the throne. Thus, he also frequently killed his kinsmen.

After the death of Emperor Wu, his son Emperor Shao ruled briefly before being judged incompetent and killed by government officials led by Xu Xianzhi, replacing him with Emperor Wen, a different son, who soon killed the officials who supported him. Emperor Wen&#x27;s reign was a period of relative political stability because of his frugality and good government; this period was called the Reign of Yuanjia ().

In 430, Emperor Wen started a number of northern expeditions against Northern Wei. These were ineffective because of insufficient preparations and excessive micromanagement of his generals, increasingly weakening the dynasty. Because of his jealousy of Tan Daoji, a noted leader of the Army of the Northern Garrison, he deprived himself of a formidable general to the great delight of the Northern Wei. Thus, they were unable to capitalize when Northern Wei suffered the Wuqi Incident. Starting in 445, Northern Wei, taking advantage of Liu Song&#x27;s weakness, made major incursions in the lands between the Yangtze and the Huai (modern Shandong, Hebei, and Henan) and devastating six provinces. Emperor Wen lamented that if Tan were still alive, he would have prevented Northern Wei advances. From then on, Liu Song was in a weakened state.

Emperor Wen was assassinated by Crown Prince Shao and Second Prince Jun in 453 after planning to punish them for witchcraft. However, they were both defeated by Third Prince Jun, who become Emperor Xiaowu. He proved to be licentious and cruel, supposedly committing incest with the daughters of an uncle who had helped him gain the throne; his rivals also claimed he had incest with his mother. This led to two rebellions by the imperial clan, one of which saw him slaughter the inhabitants of Guangling. The following ballad gives an idea of those times:
: &quot;Looking toward Jiankang city&quot;
: &quot;the little river flows against the current&quot;
: &quot;in front, one sees sons killing fathers&quot;
: &quot;and behind, one sees younger brothers killing older brothers&quot; 

Emperor Xiaowu died naturally in 464 and was succeeded by his son, who became Emperor Qianfei. Emperor Qianfei proved to be similar to his father, engaging in both kin-slaughter and incest. In a scandalous move, because his sister complained about how it was unfair that men were allowed 10,000 concubines, he gave her 30 handsome young men as lovers. His uncle Liu Yu, the Prince of Xiangdong, whom he called the &quot;Prince of Pigs&quot; for his obesity, eventually assassinated him and became Emperor Ming.

Emperor Ming began his reign by killing all of the descendants of Emperor Xiaowu, and his suspicious nature resulted in the loss of the provinces north of the Huai River, which were only briefly regained in the other Southern dynasties. Emperor Ming&#x27;s young son became Emperor Houfei. The political situation was volatile. General Xiao Daocheng slowly gained power and eventually deposed Emperor Houfei in favor of his brother, who became Emperor Shun. After defeating the rival general Shen Youzhi, Xiao forced Emperor Shun to yield the throne and crowned himself Emperor Gao of Southern Qi, thus ending the Liu Song dynasty.

===Southern Qi (479–502)===
Though distantly related, the Southern Qi and the following Liang dynasty were members of the Xiao () family from Lanling (, in modern Cangshan County, Shandong). Because Emperor Gao had a low social standing, he earned the disdain of nobility. His style of governance was similar to the early style of the Liu Song dynasty and was very economical. He died in the fourth year of his reign and his heir, who was only 13 years younger than him, succeeded him as Emperor Wu of Southern Qi. Emperor Wu made peace with the Northern Wei, content to protect his borders. This period of peace was known as Yongming Administration. He also used government secretaries appointed with provincial governors and members of the imperial clan to monitor them. 

The short reigns of Emperor Wu&#x27;s grandsons, Xiao Zhaoye and Xiao Zhaowen (his first son predeceased him), were dominated by Xiao Luan, Emperor&#x27;s Wu&#x27;s first cousin. He killed them in turn and crowned himself as Emperor Ming of Southern Qi. Using the government secretaries, he slaughtered all the sons of Emperors Gao and Wu. Emperor Ming soon became very ill and started following Daoism, changing his whole wardrobe to red. He also passed an edict making officials try to find whitebait (銀魚). He died in 498 and was succeeded by his son Xiao Baojuan, who killed high officials and governors at whim, sparking many revolts. The final revolt in 501 started after Xiao Baojuan killed his prime minister Xiao Yi, leading his brother Xiao Yan to revolt under the banner of Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s brother who was declared Emperor He of Southern Qi. Xiao Baojuan was killed by one of his generals during the siege of his capital at Jiankang, and after a short puppet reign by Emperor He, Xiao Yan overthrew the Southern Qi and established the Liang dynasty.

===Liang (502–557)===


Emperor Wu was economical, worked hard at governing, and cared for the common people. His early reign was known as Reign of Tianjian. The Liang dynasty&#x27;s military strength gradually surpassed the strength of the Northern Wei, who suffered internal strife due to their policy of sinicization. In 503, the Northern Wei invaded but were defeated at Zhongli (modern Bengbu). Emperor Wu supported the Northern Expeditions but did not aggressively take advantage of his victory in 516 at Shouyang due to heavy casualties. Given the excessive kin-slaughter in the Liu Song and Southern Qi dynasties, Emperor Wu was very lenient to imperial clansmen, not even investigating them when they committed crimes. The Liang reached a cultural peak because he was very learned, supported scholars, and encouraged the flourishing education system. An avid poet, Emperor Wu was fond of gathering many literary talents at court, and even held poetry competitions with prizes of gold or silk for those considered the best.

In his later years, however, sycophants surrounded him. Three times he dedicated his life to Buddhism and tried to become a monk, but each time he was persuaded to return by extravagant court donations to Buddhism. Furthermore, since Buddhists and Daoists were exempt from taxation, nearly half of the population fraudulently named themselves as such, badly damaging state finances. Imperial clansmen and officials were also greedy and wasteful.

Emperor Wu was willing to accept generals who defected from Northern Wei. So when Northern Wei suffered major revolts in their northern garrison towns, he sent his general Chen Qingzhi to support the pretender Yuan Hao. Despite the fact that Chen was only given 7,000 troops, he still managed to defeat army after army and even captured Luoyang, the capital of Northern Wei. Ultimately, Chen was insufficiently supplied and was defeated by troops ten times his size. After the Northern Wei split into Eastern and Western Wei, Emperor Wu granted asylum to rebel Eastern Wei commander Hou Jing, sending him on Northern Expeditions against Eastern Wei. After some initial successes, Liang forces were decisively defeated. Rumors abounded that Emperor Wu intended to give Hou as a peace offering. Despite Emperor Wu&#x27;s assurances, Hou decided to rebel in the name of Xiao Dong, the grandson of the former crown prince Xiao Tong who died in 531 and was removed from being crown prince because of conflicts with his father. Hou surprised Emperor Liang by besieging the Liang capital at Jiankang. Attempts by Liang forces to break the siege failed, and Emperor Wu was forced to negotiate a ceasefire and peace. However, Hou thought that peace was unsustainable, so he broke the ceasefire and captured the palace, leading to the slaughter of the nearby populace. Emperor Wu was starved to death and after the short puppet reigns of crown prince Xiao Gang and Xiao Dong, Hou seized power and established the Han dynasty.

In spite of conquering Jiankang, Hou essentially only controlled the nearby areas. The rest of the Liang dynasty lands were under the control of members of the imperial clan. Their squabbling amongst themselves weakened their efforts to defeat Hou. In the end, Xiao Yi, with the aid of his generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, defeated Hou, crowning himself Emperor Yuan of Liang. His brother Xiao Ji based in Sichuan, however, was still a major threat. Emperor Yuan asked for assistance from Western Wei to defeat Xiao Ji, but after subduing him, they kept Sichuan. Due to a diplomatic faux pas, he incited the anger of Yuwen Tai, the leading general of Western Wei, which resulted in him being deposed and dying. Western Wei set up the puppet state of Western Liang with capital at Jiangling. Northern Qi also had designs on the Liang throne and sent an expedition under the banner of a cousin of Emperor Yuan. Chen Baxian and Wang Sengbian set up the last surviving son of Emperor Yuan, Xiao Fangzhi, as Liang ruler, but he was not given the imperial title. After some defeats to the forces of Northern Qi, Wang Sengbian allowed their pretender, Xiao Yuanming to establish himself as Emperor Min of Liang. However, Chen Baxian was displeased with the arrangements, and in a surprise move killed Wang and deposed Emperor Min in favor of Xiao Fangzhi who became Emperor Jing of Liang. After a short reign, Chen deposed Emperor Jing and took power himself as Emperor Wu of Chen in 557.

===Chen (557–589)===

Emperor Wu of Chen came from the region of Wu (a region near modern-day Shanghai). At that time, due to the Hou Jing rebellion, the Qiao and Wu clans were greatly weakened, and many independent regimes emerged. Emperor Wu could not pacify all the independent regimes, so he adopted conciliatory measures. After the sudden death of Emperor Wu, his nephew Chen Qian took power as Emperor Wen of Chen. After the fall of Liang, the general Wang Lin had established an independent kingdom based in modern-day Hunan and Hubei provinces and was now starting to cause trouble. Wang Lin allied with Northern Zhou and Northern Qi to conquer the Chen capital at Jiankang. Emperor Wen first defeated the combined forces of Northern Qi and Wang Lin before preventing the forces of Northern Zhou from entering the South at Yueyang. Furthermore, through Emperor Wen&#x27;s extensive efforts at good governance, the economic situation of the South was greatly improved, restoring his kingdom&#x27;s national strength.

Following the death of Emperor Wen, his son, the weak-willed Chen Bozong, took power and became Emperor Fei of Chen. His uncle, Chen Xu, after essentially controlling the country through his short reign, eventually deposed him and took power as Emperor Xuan of Chen. At that time, the Northern Zhou intended to conquer Northern Qi and thus invited the Chen dynasty to help. Emperor Xuan agreed to help because he wanted to recover the lost territories south of the Huai River. In 573, he sent general Wu Mingche to assist the effort; in two years, he managed to recover he lost territories south of the Huai River. At the time, Northern Qi was in a precarious situation with little military strength and Emperor Xuan could have taken advantage of the opportunity to entirely defeat Northern Qi. However, he only wanted to protect his territories south of the Huai River. Northern Zhou instead took advantage of Northern Qi&#x27;s weakness and following their defeat of Northern Qi, in 577, they sent troops to the territories south of the Huai River, where they decisively defeated the Chen dynasty forces. The Chen dynasty was in imminent danger.

In a stroke of fortune, Northern Zhou&#x27;s Emperor Wu suddenly died and his general Yang Jian attempted to take the throne. This stopped the southern advance of the northern troops. The respite was short though, as after Yang Jian defeated his rival General Yuchi Jiong, he usurped the throne from Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou and established the Sui dynasty, crowning himself Emperor Wen of Sui. He proceeded to invade the south to reunify China. Emperor Xuan had just died and his incompetent son Chen Shubao (Houzhu of Chen) took power. He was licentious and wasteful, resulting in chaos and corruption in the government; many officials heavily exploited the people, causing great suffering. In planning to defeat the Chen dynasty, Emperor Wen of Sui took the suggestion of his general Gao Jiong and waited until the South were harvesting their crops to entirely burn the farmland, crippling the strength of the Chen dynasty. In 588, Emperor Wen of Sui sent his son Yang Guang (who would become Emperor Yang of Sui) to finally vanquish the Chen dynasty. Chen Shubao relied on the natural barrier of the Yangtze River and continued as always with his festive and licentious activities. The next year, Sui forces captured the Chen capital of Jiankang. Chen Shubao and his favorite concubine Zhang Lihua attempted to hide in a well but eventually were captured by Sui forces, thus ending the Chen dynasty.

==Diplomacy==
After the failure of the Liu Song&#x27;s efforts to form an alliance with the Rouran, Goguryeo, Tuyuhun and smaller local powers to defeat the Northern Wei, the North and South were forced into tacitly acknowledging their equal status, for example, by granting each other the highest positions as the most esteemed envoys. As the &quot;Wei Shu&quot; and &quot;Song Shu&quot; testify, there was a shift from imperial rhetoric denouncing the other side as illegitimate barbarians, towards a new conception referring to the two as distinct &#x27;Northern&#x27; and Southern&#x27; parallels, using unique local customs to distinguish themselves and compete for legitimacy.

==Demographics==
It was during the Northern and Southern dynasties period that the earliest recorded mass migration of ethnic Han to southern China (south of the Yangtze River) took place. This sinicisation helped to develop the region from its previous state of being inhabited by isolated communities separated by vast uncolonized wilderness and other non-Han ethnic groups. During this period, the south went from being nearly a frontier to being on a path to the thriving, urbanized, sinicized region that it became in later centuries. In his book &quot;Buddhism in Chinese History&quot;, Arthur F. Wright points out this fact by stating:
&quot;When we speak of the area of the Yangtze valley and below in the period of disunion, we must banish from our minds the picture of the densely populated, intensively cultivated South China of recent centuries. When the aristocrats of the remnants of the Chin [Jin] ruling house fled to the Nanking [Nanjing] area early in the 4th century, the south contained perhaps a tenth of the population of China. There were centers of Chinese culture and administration, but around most of these lay vast uncolonized areas into which Chinese settlers were slow to move&quot;.
During the Northern and Southern dynasties, the Yangtze valley transformed from a backwater frontier region with less than 25% of China&#x27;s population to a major cultural center of China with 40% of China&#x27;s population, and after China was subsequently unified under the Tang dynasty, they became the core area of Chinese culture.

==Culture==
===Language===
When the Jin court fled south they continued to speak in the refined common language, &quot;tongyu&quot;, from the Central Plains in the North, which was regarded as highly prestigious. However, many local southern Chinese resisted adopting the speech of the newcomers. During the Southern dynasties period, beginning in the mid-4th century and spreading widely by the 5th century, elite northern emigres and southern locals around the capital of Jiankang developed a new elite speech form, with clearly distinctive pronunciation and phrasing that set it apart from the Central Plains speech. However, some of the emigres also resisted this new trend to &quot;prize the speech of Wu&quot;, which they regarded as &quot;seductive and frivolous&quot;. Meanwhile, the process of Han Chinese courtiers learning Xianbei and Xianbei learning Chinese led to the court speech of the North changing as well. By the 6th century, southern elites looked down on the accent of Luoyang as &quot;crude and clumsy&quot;.

Confucianism&#x27;s unchallenged domination of Chinese culture and thought was greatly weakened during the Jin dynasty, which led to a wide diversification of political thought and philosophy by the time of the Northern and Southern dynasties. This era produced a myriad of writers that advocated practical systems of governance and administration, such as Cao Cao and Zhuge Liang in the Three Kingdoms Period, Wang Dao and Bao Jingyan of the Eastern Jin, as well as Fan Zhen, Xing Shao (), and Fan Xun () of the Northern and Southern period. Much of the philosophy of the period is despondent and dispirited, and a number of scholars and poets became reclusive mountain hermits living apart from society. Of these various trends, the most influential was Neo-Daoism (). Neo-Daoism was highly influential during the Southern Dynasty, to the point that Emperor Wen of Liu Song established a Neo-Daoist Academy and promoted it, along with Confucianism, literature, and history, as the four great subjects of study. A phenomenon known as &quot;empty chat&quot; () became common, where educated men would meet and talk about philosophy all day without paying any attention to &quot;mundane&quot; things such as their profession or family. The phenomenon gradually waned during the Sui dynasty, though it did not fully disappear until the Tang dynasty.

===Literature===
Literature was particularly vibrant during the Southern Dynasty and tended to be flowery and frilly, while Northern Dynasty literature was rougher and more straightforward. Notable writers include Yu Xin, Xing Fang, Wei Shou, and Wen Zisheng of the Northern Dynasty. In poetry, &quot;fu&quot; poetry continued to be a dominant genre, though the five-syllable form that achieved great prominence during the Tang dynasty gradually increased in popularity. In the Southern Dynasty, a type of essay known as &quot;pian wen&quot; (), which used metered rhyme, flowery language, and classical allusions, became popular. Writings often spoke of removing oneself from everyday material existence and jettisoning cares and anxiety.

Poets of the Northern and Southern dynasties focused on imitating older classical poets of Ancient China, formalizing the rhyme patterns and meters that governed poem composition. However, scholars realized that ancient songs and poems, like those of the Shijing, in many instances no longer rhymed due to sound shifts over the previous centuries.
The introduction of Buddhism to China, which began in the late Han dynasty and continued through the Tang dynasty, introduced Chinese scholars to Sanskrit. The Brahmi script, with its sophisticated phonological organization, arrived in China in the 5th century, and was studied by Xie Lingyun, who produced a (since-lost) glossary of Chinese transcriptions of Sanskrit terms &quot;arranged according to the 14 sounds&quot;.
The four tones of early Middle Chinese were first described by Shen Yue and Zhou Yong.

===Other arts===
The southern dynasties of China were rich in cultural achievement, with the flourishing of Buddhism and Daoism, especially the latter as two new canons of scriptural writings were created for the Supreme Purity sect and its rival the Numinous Treasure Sect. The southern Chinese were influenced greatly by the writings of Buddhist monks such as Huiyuan, who applied familiar Daoist terms to describe Buddhism for other Chinese. The Chinese were in contact and influenced by cultures of India and trading partners farther south, such as the kingdoms of Funan and Champa (located in modern-day Cambodia and Vietnam).

The sophistication and complexity of the Chinese arts of poetry, calligraphy, painting, and playing of music reached new heights during this age. The earlier Cao Zhi, son of Cao Cao, is regarded as one of the greatest poets of his day. His style and deep emotional expression in writing influenced later poets of this new age, such as Tao Qian (365–427) or Tao Yuanming. Even during his lifetime, the written calligraphy of the &quot;Sage of Calligraphy&quot;, Wang Xizhi (307–365), was prized by many and considered a true form of personal expression like other arts. Painting became highly prized with artists such as Gu Kaizhi (344–406), who largely established the tradition of landscape art in classical Chinese painting (to learn more, refer to the &quot;Far East&quot; section of the article for Painting).

Institutions of learning in the south were also renowned, including the Zongmingguan (Imperial Nanjing University), where the famed Zu Chongzhi (mentioned above) had studied. Zu Chongzhi devised the new Daming Calendar in 465, calculated one year as 365.24281481 days (which is very close to 365.24219878 days as we know today), and calculated the number of overlaps between sun and moon as 27.21223 (which is very close to 27.21222 as we know today). Using this number he successfully predicted 4 eclipses during a period of 23 years (from 436 to 459).

Although multiple-story towers such as guard towers and residential apartments existed in previous periods, during this period the distinct Chinese pagoda tower (for storing Buddhist scriptures) evolved from the stupa, the latter originating from Buddhist traditions of protecting sutras in ancient India.

<text>The Southern dynasties () describe a succession of Chinese empires that coexisted alongside a series of Northern dynasties. The era is generally described as the Northern and Southern dynasties, lasting from 420–589 AD after the Jin and before the Sui dynasty.

The Southern dynasties were as follows:
* Liu Song (420–479 AD)
* Southern Qi (479–502 AD)
* Liang dynasty (502–557 AD)
* Chen dynasty (557–589 AD)

The Western Liang (555–587 AD) was a rump successor to the Liang dynasty and is typically not regarded as a legitimate regime that bore the Mandate of Heaven.

==Emperors of the Southern dynasties==

==Emperors of the Western Liang dynasty (555–587 AD)==
The Western Liang is also sometimes called the &quot;Later Liang&quot; (not to be confused with the Later Liang of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period).

<text>The Haida (, , , , ) are an Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America. They constitute one of 203 First Nations in British Columbia and 231 federally recognized tribes in Alaska.

Their traditional territory include Haida Gwaii, an archipelago off the coast of British Columbia, and the southern half of Prince of Wales Island, in Southeast Alaska. Their language is Haida, a linguistic isolate. The Haida are known for their craftsmanship, trading skills, and seamanship. They are known to have frequently carried out raids and to have practiced slavery.

In Canada, the Haida are represented by Council of the Haida Nation (CHN), in addition to the two village band governments, Old Massett Village Council and Skidegate Band Council. Federally recognized Haida tribes in the United States include the Central Council of the Tlingit &amp; Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska and the Hydaburg Cooperative Association.

==History==
=== Pre-contact ===
Haida history begins with the arrival of the primordial ancestresses of the Haida matrilineages in Haida Gwaii. These include SGuuluu Jaad (Foam Woman), Jiila Kuns (Creek Woman), and KalGa Jaad (Ice woman). The Haida canon of oral histories and archaeological findings agree that Haida ancestors lived alongside glaciers and were present at the time of the arrival of the first tree, a lodgepole pine, on Haida Gwaii. Recent archaeological evidence suggests habitation as early as 13,100 BP.

For thousands of years since Haida have participated in a rigorous coast-wide legal system called Potlatch. After the Island&#x27;s wide arrival of red cedar some 7,500 years ago Haida society transformed to centre around the coastal &quot;tree of life&quot;. Massive carved cedar monuments and cedar big houses became widespread throughout Haida Gwaii.

In the early 18th century, Haida from K&#x27;iis Gwaii in the Duu Guusd region of Haida Gwaii migrated north, settling at the southern half of Prince of Wales Island in Alaska, next to Tlingit territory. This group would become known as the Kaigani Haida

=== 18th century ===
The first recorded contact between the Haida and Europeans was in July 1774 with Spanish explorer Juan Pérez, who was sailing north on an expedition to find and claim new territory for Spain. For two days in a row, the Santiago sat off the shore of Haida Gwaii waiting for the currents to settle down enough to allow them to dock and set foot on land. While they waited, several canoes of Haida sailed out to greet them, and ultimately to trade with Pérez and his men. After two days of poor conditions, however, the Santiago was ultimately unable to dock and they were forced to depart without having set foot on Haida Gwaii.

The Haida conducted regular trade with Russian, Spanish, British, and American maritime fur traders and whalers. According to sailing records, they diligently maintained strong trade relationships with Westerners, coastal people, and among themselves. Trade for sea-otter pelts was initiated by British Captain George Dixon with the Haida in 1787. The Haida did well for themselves in this industry and until the mid-1800s they were at the centre of the profitable China sea-otter trade.

Although they had gone on expeditions as far as Washington State, at first they had minimal confrontations with Europeans. Between 1780 and 1830, the Haida came into conflict with European and American traders. Among the dozens of ships the tribe captured were the &quot;Eleanor&quot; and the &quot;Susan Sturgis&quot;. The tribe made use of European weapons they acquired, using cannons and canoe-mounted swivel guns.

=== 19th century ===
In 1850, gold was discovered on southern Haida Gwaii. The Haida had been instructed to look for the mineral by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. A Haida man, possibly Albert Edenshaw, was shown where to find gold by an elderly woman in Skidegate, which he subsequently brought to officers at Fort Simpson. This discovery instigated a brief gold rush in 1851, drawing American prospectors to the area. The Haida themselves took an active role in the mining of gold, seeing it as a new material for trade. In response to the gold rush, British colonial authorities formally annexed Haida Gwaii in 1853, establishing the Colony of the Queen Charlotte Islands. It was later integrated into the Colony of British Columbia in 1858. Colonial authorities backed their claims using gunboat diplomacy, both in Haida Gwaii and more broadly throughout northeastern Pacific coastal Indigenous title territories.

Also in 1857, the was sent from Seattle to nearby Port Gamble, where indigenous raiding parties made up of Haida (from territory claimed by the British) and Tongass (from territory claimed by the Russians) had been attacking and enslaving the Coast Salish people there. When the Haida and Tongass (sea lion tribe Tlingit) warriors refused to acknowledge American jurisdiction and to hand over those among them who had attacked the Puget Sound communities, a battle ensued in which 26 natives and one government soldier were killed. In the aftermath of this, Colonel Isaac Ebey, a U.S. military officer and the first settler on Whidbey Island, was shot and beheaded on August 11, 1857, by a small Tlingit group from Kake, Alaska, in retaliation for the killing of a respected Kake chief in the raid the year before. Ebey&#x27;s scalp was purchased from the Kake by an American trader in 1860.

==== Smallpox epidemic of 1862 ====

The 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic began on March 26 when a steamship called &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; arrived in Fort Victoria from San Francisco containing a passenger infected with smallpox. At the time thousands of Indigenous people lived in villages outside the walls of Fort Victoria. The disease broke out amongst Tsimshian people in their community near Fort Victoria. This quickly spread into a pandemic. European public health standards at the time were well practiced and adhered-to official health standards, including vaccinations and victims isolation. Instead, as the disease spread, Victoria Police burned some one dozen homes, deliberately displacing 200 Haida on May 13. They went on to burn some 40–50 more indigenous villages the following day.

First Nations from further north had been camping periodically outside the city limits of Victoria to take advantage of trade, and at the time of the epidemic numbered almost 2000, many of whom were Haida. The colonial government made no effort to vaccinate the First Nations in the region nor to quarantine anyone infected. In June, the encampments were forcibly cleared by police, and 20 canoes of Haidas, many of whom were likely already infected with smallpox, were forced back to Haida Gwaii, escorted by gunboats HMS &quot;Grappler&quot; and &quot;Forward&quot;. Those infected did not make it home, according to the plans of the colonial governments, and passed on at Bones Bay near Alert Bay.

Later on a group of copper miners travelled from Bella Coola aboard the &quot;Leonede&quot; under command of Captain McAlmond. The boat took 12 passengers in December. One of these passengers carried smallpox to Haida Gwaii. This might not have been a disaster should the infected miner have stayed in isolation at the mining site on , or Skincuttle Island. Instead the disease was spread throughout Haida Gwaii.

The disease quickly spread throughout Haida Gwaii, devastating entire villages and families, and creating an influx of refugees. The pre-epidemic population of Haida Gwaii was estimated to be 6,607, but was reduced to 829 in 1881. The only two remaining villages were Massett and Skidegate. The population collapse caused by the epidemic weakened Haida sovereignty and power, ultimately paving the way for colonization.

==== Arrival of missionaries ====
From the mid-19th century onwards, both Anglican and Methodist missions were established on Haida Gwaii, endeavouring to convert the Haida people. The first known missionary to spend time with the Haida was Jonathan Green, a missionary for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Green spent a few weeks on Haida Gwaii in the summer of 1829, though his later suggestions for the establishment of a mission on the coast were ignored.

In 1854 and 1868, two different Anglican missionaries tried garner support for the establishment of a mission on Haida Gwaii, to no avail. In the 1860s, several Northern Haida visited the newly founded Tsimshian community of Metlakatla, by Anglican missionary William Duncan, prompting them to request a missionary of their own. It wouldn&#x27;t be until November 1876, Anglican missionary William Collison, acting on behalf of the Church Mission Society, established the first permanent mission on Haida Gwaii, located in Masset. In response to the Anglican mission established in Masset, the Haida in Skidegate petitioned for their own mission. Consequently, a Methodist mission was established there in 1883.

==== Potlatch ban ====

The potlatch () began to decline with the arrival of the missionaries, who believed it to be antithetical to their mission of converting the Haida to Christianity. Missionaries like Collison sought to replace the with Christian ceremonies, such as the singing of hymns. Others, like Methodist Charles Harrison, dissuaded potlatching through public chastisement. By the 1880s, potlatches were often conducted in secrecy, primarily as a result of pressure exerted by missionaries.

In 1884, the potlatch was outlawed throughout the coast, under an amendment to the Indian Act, known as the potlatch ban. The elimination of the potlatch system destroyed financial relationships and seriously interrupted the cultural heritage of coastal people. As the islands were christianized, many cultural works such as totem posts were destroyed or taken to museums around the world. This significantly undermined Haida&#x27;s self-knowledge and further diminished morale.

=== 20th century ===

The government began forcibly sending some Haida children to residential schools as early as 1911. Haida children were sent as far away as Alberta to live among English-speaking families where they were to be assimilated into the dominant culture.

In 1911, Canada and British Columbia rejected a Haida offer whereby in exchange for full rights of British citizenship Haidas would formally join the Dominion of Canada.

==== Lyell Island protests ====
In November 1985, members of the Haida nation protested the ongoing logging of old-growth forests on Haida Gwaii, establishing a blockade to prevent the logging of Lyell Island by Western Forest Products. A standoff between protesters, police and loggers lasted two weeks, during which 72 Haidas were arrested. Images of elders being arrested gained media traction, which raised awareness and support for the Haida across Canada. In 1987, the governments of Canada and British Columbia signed the &quot;South Moresby Agreement,&quot; establishing the Gwaii Haanas National Park, which is cooperatively managed by the Canadian government and the Haida Nation.

The blockade was profiled in Christopher Auchter&#x27;s 2024 documentary film &quot;The Stand&quot;.

=== 21st century ===
In December 2009, the government of British Columbia officially renamed the archipelago from Queen Charlotte Islands to Haida Gwaii. The Haida Nation asserts Haida title over all of Haida Gwaii and is pursuing negotiations with the provincial and federal governments. Haida authorities continue to pass legislation and manage human activities in Haida Gwaii, which includes making formal agreements with the Canadian communities established on the islands. Haida efforts are largely directed at the protection of land and water and functioning ecosystems and this is expressed in the protected status for nearly 70% of the million-hectare archipelago. The protected status applies to the landscape and water as well as smaller culturally significant areas. They have also forced a reduction of large-scale industrial activity and the careful regulation of access to resources.

In British Columbia, the term &quot;Haida Nation&quot; often refers to the Haida people as a whole however, it also refers to their government, the Council of the Haida Nation. All people of Haida ancestry are entitled to Haida citizenship, including the Kaigani, who as Alaskans are also part of the Central Council Tlingit Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska government.

In a deal negotiated between the government and the Haida nation over the preceding decades, British Columbia in 2024 transferred the title of more than 200 islands off Canada&#x27;s west coast to the Haida people, recognizing the nation&#x27;s aboriginal land title across all of Haida Gwaii.

== Culture ==
=== Language ===

The Haida language is considered to be an isolate. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Haida was de facto banned with the introduction of residential schools and the enforcement of the use of English language. Haida language revitalization projects began in the 1970s and continue to this day. It is estimated that there are only 3 or 4 dozen Haida-speaking people with almost all of them being the age of 70 or older.

=== Potlatch ===

Haida host potlatches which were intricate economic and social-political processes that include acquisition of incorporeal wealth like names and the circulation of property in the form of gifts. They are often held when a citizen wishes to commemorate an event of importance. For example, deaths of a loved one, marriages, and other civil proceedings. The more important potlatches take years to prepare and can continue for days.

=== Art ===
Haida society continues to produce a robust and highly stylized art form, a leading component of Northwest Coast art. While artists frequently have expressed this in large wooden carvings (totem poles), Chilkat weaving, or ornate jewellery, in the 21st century, younger people are also making art in a popular expression such as Haida manga.

The Haida also created &quot;notions of wealth&quot;, and Jenness credits them with the introduction of the totem pole (Haida: &quot;&quot;) and the bentwood box. Missionaries regarded the carved poles as graven images rather than representations of the family histories that wove Haida society together. Chiefly families showed their histories by erecting totems outside their homes, or on house posts forming the building.

Well known contemporary Haida artists include Bill Reid, Robert Davidson, Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas, and Freda Diesing amongst others.

==== Transformation masks ====
Transformation masks were worn ceremonially, used by dancers and represented or illustrated the connection between various spirits. The masks usually depicted an animal transforming into another animal or a spiritual or mythical being. Masks were representations of the souls of the mask owner&#x27;s family waiting in the afterlife to be reborn. Masks worn during ceremonial dances were designed with strings to open the mask, transforming the spiritual animal into a carving of the ancestor underneath. There was also an emphasis on the idea of metamorphosis and reincarnation. With the banning of potlatches by the Canadian government in 1885, many masks were confiscated. Masks and many other objects are considered sacred and designed only for specific people to see. It was unknown who the wearer of the mask was as each mask was made for each individual&#x27;s soul and spirit animal. Due to the confiscation of the masks and the sacred meaning to each individual who wore the mask, it is unknown if the masks in museums are truly meant to be seen or if they are an aspect of European colonialism and the rejection of Haida religious and spiritual traditions.

==== Film ====
In 2018, the first feature-length Haida-language film, &quot;The Edge of the Knife&quot; (), was released, with an all-Haida cast. The actors learned Haida for their performances in the film, with a two-week training camp followed by lessons throughout the five weeks of filming. Haida artist Gwaai Edenshaw and Tsilhqot&#x27;in filmmaker Helen Haig-Brown directed, with Edenshaw and his brother being co-screenwriters, with Graham Richard and Leonie Sandercock.

Christopher Auchter, the nephew of Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas, has created a number of Haida centered films. In 2017 he directed the animated film &quot;The Mountain of SGaana&quot;, inspired by Haida mythology. His short documentary &quot;Now Is the Time&quot; premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival.

=== Social organization ===

==== Moieties ====
The Haida nation was split between two moieties, the Raven and the Eagle. Marriages between two people from the same moiety were prohibited. Due to this any children that were born after the marriage would officially become part of the moiety that the mother had come from. Each group provided its members with entitlement to a vast range of economic resources such as fishing spots, hunting or collecting areas, and housing sites. Each group also had rights to their own myths and legends, dances, songs, and music. Eagles and Ravens were very important to the Haida families as they would identify with one or the other and this would signify what side on the village they would reside on. The family would also own their own property, had specific areas for food gathering. These categories of Eagles and Ravens divided them on an even larger scale, specifying their land, history, and customs.

The Haida social system changed significantly by the end of the nineteenth century. At this point a majority of the Haida had taken nuclear family forms, and members of families belonging in the same moiety (Ravens and Eagles) were permitted to marry each other.

==== Gender ====
The roles of the family varied between men and women. Men were responsible for all of the hunting and fishing, building homes and carving canoes and totem poles. The women&#x27;s responsibilities were to stay close to home doing a majority of their work on the land. Women were responsible for all of the chores in relation to the keeping of the home. Women were also in charge of curing cedarwood to use for weaving and making clothes. It was also the duty of the women to gather berries and dig for shellfish and clams.

Once a boy hit puberty, his uncles on his mothers&#x27; side would educate him on his family history and how to behave now that he was a man. It was believed that a special diet would increase his abilities. For example, duck tongues helped him hold his breath under water, whereas blue jay tongues helped him to be a strong climber.

The aunts on the father&#x27;s side of a young Haida woman would teach her about her duties to her tribe once she first began to menstruate. The young woman would go to a secluded space in her family home. They believed that by making her sleep on a stone pillow and only allowing her to eat and drink small amounts she would become tougher.

Although not commonly practiced today, it was once customary for young boys and girls entering puberty to embark on vision quests. These quests would send them out alone for days. They would travel through the forests, in hopes of finding a spirit to guide them through their lives. It was believed that boys and girls who were destined for greatness could find unique spirit guides. A successful vision quest was celebrated by the wearing of masks, face paints, and costumes. 

=== Religion ===
Haida beliefs are varied and diverse. Modern Haida ascribe to a wide variety of faiths including Protestantism, Catholicism, and Bahá&#x27;i. Nihilist, atheist, agnostic, and absurdist perspectives also attend the nation&#x27;s post-colonial context. Pre-colonial beliefs, however, may still be most popular, and potlatch maintains its elevated situation in Haida society.

Many Haida believe in an ultimate being called &quot;Ne-kilst-lass&quot;, spelt Nang Kilsdlaas in Skidegate dialect, which can manifest through the form and antics of a Raven. &quot;Ne-kilst-lass&quot; revealed the world and was an active player in the creation of life. While &quot;Ne-kilst-lass&quot; has a generous inclination, they also includes a darker, indulgent, and trickster quality. 

Nang Kilsldaas is merely one of many dozens of supernatural beings who personify a wide variety of forces, objects, places, and phenomena. A few of the most prevalent include K_ing.gii, a deity who presides over the seas; X_yuu, the northeast wind; and Sin SG_aanuwee, a cosmological &quot;super-being&quot; that encompasses all others.

=== Warfare ===
Prior to contact with Europeans, other Indigenous communities regarded the Haida as aggressive warriors and made attempts to avoid sea battles with them. There is some archeological evidence that the Northwest coast tribes, to which the Haida belong, engaged in warfare as early as 2200 BC, although it was not a regular occurrence in the archeological record until the subsequent millennium. Though the Haida were more likely to participate in sea battles, it was not uncommon for them to engage in hand-to-hand combat or long-range attacks. Hostilities were not always violent, often ritualized and some resulting in Peace Treaties still in force hundreds of years later.

==== Archeological and written evidence of warfare ====
Analyses of skeletal injuries dating from the late Archaic period and early Formative period show that Northwest coast nations, particularly in the North where most Haida communities were situated, began more frequently engaging in battles of some sort from 1800 BC to AD 500, though the number of battles is unknown. This rise in the incidence of battles during the Middle Pacific period also correlates with the erection of the first defensive fortifications in Haida communities. These fortifications continued to be in use during the 18th century as evidenced by Captain James Cook&#x27;s discovery of one such hilltop fortification in a Haida village. Numerous other sightings of such fortifications were recorded by other European explorers during this century.

==== Causes of warfare ====
There were multiple motivations for the Haida people to engage in warfare. Various accounts explain that the Haida went to battle more for revenge than anything else, and would acquire slaves from their enemies in the process. According to the anthropologist Margaret Blackman, warfare on Haida Gwaii was primarily motivated by revenge. Many Northwest coast legends tell of Haida communities raiding and fighting with neighbouring communities because of insults or other disputes. Other causes included conflicts over property, territory, resources, trade routes, and even women. However, a battle between a Haida community and another often did not have simply one cause. In fact, many battles were the result of decades old disputes.

The Haida, like several other Northwest coast Indigenous communities, engaged in slave raiding as slaves were highly sought after for their use as labor as well as bodyguards and warriors. During the 19th century, the Haida fought physically with other Indigenous communities to ensure domination of the fur trade with European merchants. Haida groups also had feuds with these European merchants that could last years. In 1789, some Haidas were accused of stealing items from Captain Kendrick, most of which included drying linen. Kendrick seized two Haida chiefs and threatened to kill them via cannon-fire if they did not return the stolen items. Though the Haida community complied at the time, less than two years later 100 to 200 of its people attacked the same ship.

==== War parties ====
The missionary William Collison describes having seen a Haida fleet of around forty canoes. However, he does not provide the number of warriors in these canoes, and there are no other known accounts that describe the number of warriors in a war party. The structure of a Haida war party generally followed that of the community itself, the only difference being that the chief took the lead during battles; otherwise his title was more or less meaningless. Medicine men were often brought along raids or before battles to &quot;destroy the souls of enemies&quot; and ensure victory.

==== Death in battle ====
Battles between a group of Haida warriors and another community sometimes resulted in the annihilation of either one or both of the groups involved. Villages would be burned down during a battle which was a common practice during Northwest coast battles. The Haida burned their warriors who died in battles, though it is not known if this act was done after each battle or only after battles in which they were victorious. The Haida believed that fallen warriors went to the House of Sun, which was considered a highly honorable death. For this reason, a specially made military suit was prepared for chiefs if they fell in battle. The slaves belonging to the chiefs who died in battle were burned with them.

==== Weapons used ====
The Haida used the bow and arrow until it was replaced by firearms acquired from Europeans in the 19th century, but other traditional weapons were still preferred. The weapons that the Haida used were often multi-functional; they were used not only in battle, but during other activities as well. For instance, daggers were very common and almost always the weapon of choice for hand-to-hand combat, and were also used during hunting and to create other tools. One medicine man&#x27;s dagger that Alexander Mackenzie came across during his exploration of Haida Gwaii, was used both for fights and to hold the medicine man&#x27;s hair up. Another dagger that Mackenzie obtained from a Haida village was said to be connected to a Haida legend; many daggers had individual histories which made them unique from one another.

==== Battle armour ====
The Haida wore rod-and-slat armour. This meant greaves for the thighs and lower back and slats (a long strip of wood) in the side pieces to allow for more flexibility during movement. They wore elk hide tunics under their armour and wooden helmets. Arrows could not penetrate this armour, and Russian explorers found that bullets could penetrate the armour only if shot from a distance of less than . The Haida rarely used shields because of their developed armour.

<doc id="74141" wikidata="Q40754" url="?curid=74141" title="Subtraction">
<text>Subtraction (which is signified by the minus sign, –) is one of the four arithmetic operations along with addition, multiplication and division. Subtraction is an operation that represents removal of objects from a collection. For example, in the adjacent picture, there are peaches—meaning 5 peaches with 2 taken away, resulting in a total of 3 peaches. Therefore, the &quot;difference&quot; of 5 and 2 is 3; that is, . While primarily associated with natural numbers in arithmetic, subtraction can also represent removing or decreasing physical and abstract quantities using different kinds of objects including negative numbers, fractions, irrational numbers, vectors, decimals, functions, and matrices.

In a sense, subtraction is the inverse of addition. That is, if and only if . In words: the difference of two numbers is the number that gives the first one when added to the second one.

Subtraction follows several important patterns. It is anticommutative, meaning that changing the order changes the sign of the answer. It is also not associative, meaning that when one subtracts more than two numbers, the order in which subtraction is performed matters. Because is the additive identity, subtraction of it does not change a number. Subtraction also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations, such as addition and multiplication. All of these rules can be proven, starting with the subtraction of integers and generalizing up through the real numbers and beyond. General binary operations that follow these patterns are studied in abstract algebra.

In computability theory, considering subtraction is not well-defined over natural numbers, operations between numbers are actually defined using &quot;truncated subtraction&quot; or monus.

==Notation and terminology==

Subtraction is usually written using the minus sign &quot;−&quot; between the terms; that is, in infix notation. The result is expressed with an equals sign. For example,
:formula_1 (pronounced as &quot;two minus one equals one&quot;)
:formula_2 (pronounced as &quot;four minus two equals two&quot;)
:formula_3 (pronounced as &quot;six minus three equals three&quot;)
:formula_4 (pronounced as &quot;four minus six equals negative two&quot;)

There are also situations where subtraction is &quot;understood&quot;, even though no symbol appears:
* A column of two numbers, with the lower number in red, usually indicates that the lower number in the column is to be subtracted, with the difference written below, under a line. This is most common in accounting.

Formally, the number being subtracted is known as the subtrahend, while the number it is subtracted from is the minuend. The result is the difference. That is, 
:formula_5.

All of this terminology derives from Latin. &quot;&quot; is an English word derived from the Latin verb &quot;subtrahere&quot;, which in turn is a compound of &quot;sub&quot; &quot;from under&quot; and &quot;trahere&quot; &quot;to pull&quot;. Thus, to subtract is to &quot;draw from below&quot;, or to &quot;take away&quot;. Using the gerundive suffix &quot;-nd&quot; results in &quot;subtrahend&quot;, &quot;thing to be subtracted&quot;. Likewise, from &quot;minuere&quot; &quot;to reduce or diminish&quot;, one gets &quot;minuend&quot;, which means &quot;thing to be diminished&quot;.

==Of integers and real numbers==
===Integers===

Imagine a line segment of length &quot;b&quot; with the left end labeled &quot;a&quot; and the right end labeled &quot;c&quot;.
Starting from &quot;a&quot;, it takes &quot;b&quot; steps to the right to reach &quot;c&quot;. This movement to the right is modeled mathematically by addition:
:&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = &quot;c&quot;.

From &quot;c&quot;, it takes &quot;b&quot; steps to the &quot;left&quot; to get back to &quot;a&quot;. This movement to the left is modeled by subtraction:
:&quot;c&quot; − &quot;b&quot; = &quot;a&quot;.
Now, a line segment labeled with the numbers , , and . From position 3, it takes no steps to the left to stay at 3, so . It takes 2 steps to the left to get to position 1, so . This picture is inadequate to describe what would happen after going 3 steps to the left of position 3. To represent such an operation, the line must be extended.

To subtract arbitrary natural numbers, one begins with a line containing every natural number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...). From 3, it takes 3 steps to the left to get to 0, so . But is still invalid, since it again leaves the line. The natural numbers are not a useful context for subtraction.

The solution is to consider the integer number line (..., −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...). This way, it takes 4 steps to the left from 3 to get to −1:

===Natural numbers===
Subtraction of natural numbers is not closed: the difference is not a natural number unless the minuend is greater than or equal to the subtrahend. For example, 26 cannot be subtracted from 11 to give a natural number. Such a case uses one of two approaches:
# Conclude that 26 cannot be subtracted from 11; subtraction becomes a partial function.
# Give the answer as an integer representing a negative number, so the result of subtracting 26 from 11 is −15.

===Real numbers===
The field of real numbers can be defined specifying only two binary operations, addition and multiplication, together with unary operations yielding additive and multiplicative inverses. The subtraction of a real number (the subtrahend) from another (the minuend) can then be defined as the addition of the minuend and the additive inverse of the subtrahend. For example, . Alternatively, instead of requiring these unary operations, the binary operations of subtraction and division can be taken as basic.

==Properties==
===Anti-commutativity===
Subtraction is anti-commutative, meaning that if one reverses the terms in a difference left-to-right, the result is the negative of the original result. Symbolically, if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are any two numbers, then
:&quot;a&quot; − &quot;b&quot; = −(&quot;b&quot; − &quot;a)&quot;.

===Non-associativity===
Subtraction is non-associative, which comes up when one tries to define repeated subtraction. In general, the expression
:&quot;&quot;a&quot; − &quot;b&quot; − &quot;c&quot;&quot;
can be defined to mean either (&quot;a&quot; − &quot;b&quot;) − &quot;c&quot; or &quot;a&quot; − (&quot;b&quot; − &quot;c&quot;), but these two possibilities lead to different answers. To resolve this issue, one must establish an order of operations, with different orders yielding different results.

===Predecessor===
In the context of integers, subtraction of one also plays a special role: for any integer &quot;a&quot;, the integer is the largest integer less than &quot;a&quot;, also known as the predecessor of &quot;a&quot;.

==Units of measurement==
When subtracting two numbers with units of measurement such as kilograms or pounds, they must have the same unit. In most cases, the difference will have the same unit as the original numbers.

===Percentages===
Changes in percentages can be reported in at least two forms, percentage change and percentage point change. Percentage change represents the relative change between the two quantities as a percentage, while percentage point change is simply the number obtained by subtracting the two percentages.

As an example, suppose that 30% of widgets made in a factory are defective. Six months later, 20% of widgets are defective. The percentage change is = − = %, while the percentage point change is −10 percentage points.

==In computing==
The method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only the addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators, and is still used in modern computers.
To subtract a binary number &quot;y&quot; (the subtrahend) from another number &quot;x&quot; (the minuend), the ones&#x27; complement of &quot;y&quot; is added to &quot;x&quot; and one is added to the sum. The leading digit &quot;1&quot; of the result is then discarded.

The method of complements is especially useful in binary (radix 2) since the ones&#x27; complement is very easily obtained by inverting each bit (changing &quot;0&quot; to &quot;1&quot; and vice versa). And adding 1 to get the two&#x27;s complement can be done by simulating a carry into the least significant bit. For example:

 01100100 (x, equals decimal 100)
 - 00010110 (y, equals decimal 22)

becomes the sum:

 01100100 (x)
 + 11101001 (ones&#x27; complement of y)
 + 1 (to get the two&#x27;s complement)
 101001110

Dropping the initial &quot;1&quot; gives the answer: 01001110 (equals decimal 78)

==The teaching of subtraction in schools==
Methods used to teach subtraction to elementary school vary from country to country, and within a country, different methods are adopted at different times. In what is known in the United States as traditional mathematics, a specific process is taught to students at the end of the 1st year (or during the 2nd year) for use with multi-digit whole numbers, and is extended in either the fourth or fifth grade to include decimal representations of fractional numbers.

===In America===
Almost all American schools currently teach a method of subtraction using borrowing or regrouping (the decomposition algorithm) and a system of markings called crutches. Although a method of borrowing had been known and published in textbooks previously, the use of crutches in American schools spread after William A. Brownell published a study—claiming that crutches were beneficial to students using this method. This system caught on rapidly, displacing the other methods of subtraction in use in America at that time.

===In Europe===
Some European schools employ a method of subtraction called the Austrian method, also known as the additions method. There is no borrowing in this method. There are also crutches (markings to aid memory), which vary by country.

===Comparing the two main methods===
Both these methods break up the subtraction as a process of one digit subtractions by place value. Starting with a least significant digit, a subtraction of the subtrahend:
:&quot;s&quot;&quot;j&quot; &quot;s&quot;&quot;j&quot;−1 ... &quot;s&quot;1
from the minuend
:&quot;m&quot;&quot;k&quot; &quot;m&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1 ... &quot;m&quot;1,
where each &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a digit, proceeds by writing down , , and so forth, as long as &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; does not exceed &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Otherwise, &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot; is increased by 10 and some other digit is modified to correct for this increase. The American method corrects by attempting to decrease the minuend digit &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 by one (or continuing the borrow leftwards until there is a non-zero digit from which to borrow). The European method corrects by increasing the subtrahend digit &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 by one.

Example: 704 − 512.

The minuend is 704, the subtrahend is 512. The minuend digits are , and . The subtrahend digits are , and . Beginning at the one&#x27;s place, 4 is not less than 2 so the difference 2 is written down in the result&#x27;s one&#x27;s place. In the ten&#x27;s place, 0 is less than 1, so the 0 is increased by 10, and the difference with 1, which is 9, is written down in the ten&#x27;s place. The American method corrects for the increase of ten by reducing the digit in the minuend&#x27;s hundreds place by one. That is, the 7 is struck through and replaced by a 6. The subtraction then proceeds in the hundreds place, where 6 is not less than 5, so the difference is written down in the result&#x27;s hundred&#x27;s place. We are now done, the result is 192.

The Austrian method does not reduce the 7 to 6. Rather it increases the subtrahend hundreds digit by one. A small mark is made near or below this digit (depending on the school). Then the subtraction proceeds by asking what number when increased by 1, and 5 is added to it, makes 7. The answer is 1, and is written down in the result&#x27;s hundreds place.

There is an additional subtlety in that the student always employs a mental subtraction table in the American method. The Austrian method often encourages the student to mentally use the addition table in reverse. In the example above, rather than adding 1 to 5, getting 6, and subtracting that from 7, the student is asked to consider what number, when increased by 1, and 5 is added to it, makes 7.

==Subtraction by hand==
===Austrian method===
Example:
===Subtraction from left to right===
Example:
===American method===
In this method, each digit of the subtrahend is subtracted from the digit above it starting from right to left. If the top number is too small to subtract the bottom number from it, we add 10 to it; this 10 is &quot;borrowed&quot; from the top digit to the left, which we subtract 1 from. Then we move on to subtracting the next digit and borrowing as needed, until every digit has been subtracted. Example:
===Trade first===
A variant of the American method where all borrowing is done before all subtraction.

Example:
===Partial differences===
The partial differences method is different from other vertical subtraction methods because no borrowing or carrying takes place. In their place, one places plus or minus signs depending on whether the minuend is greater or smaller than the subtrahend. The sum of the partial differences is the total difference.

Example:
===Nonvertical methods===
====Counting up====
Instead of finding the difference digit by digit, one can count up the numbers between the subtrahend and the minuend.

Example:
1234 − 567 = can be found by the following steps:
* 
* 
Add up the value from each step to get the total difference: .

====Breaking up the subtraction====
Another method that is useful for mental arithmetic is to split up the subtraction into small steps.

Example:
1234 − 567 = can be solved in the following way:
* 1234 − 500 = 734
* 734 − 60 = 674
* 674 − 7 = 667

====Same change====
The same change method uses the fact that adding or subtracting the same number from the minuend and subtrahend does not change the answer. One simply adds the amount needed to get zeros in the subtrahend.

Example:

&quot;1234 − 567 =&quot; can be solved as follows:

<text>Totem poles () are monumental carvings found in western Canada and the northwestern United States. They are a type of Northwest Coast art, consisting of poles, posts or pillars, carved with symbols or figures. They are usually made from large trees, mostly western red cedar, by First Nations and Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast including northern Northwest Coast Haida, Tlingit, and Tsimshian communities in Southeast Alaska and British Columbia, Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw and Nuu-chah-nulth communities in southern British Columbia, and the Coast Salish communities in Washington and British Columbia.

The word &quot;totem&quot; derives from the Algonquian word &quot;odoodem&quot; [] meaning &quot;(his) kinship group&quot;. The carvings may symbolize or commemorate ancestors, cultural beliefs that recount familiar legends, clan lineages, or notable events. The poles may also serve as functional architectural features, welcome signs for village visitors, mortuary vessels for the remains of deceased ancestors, or as a means to publicly ridicule someone. They may embody a historical narrative of significance to the people carving and installing the pole. Given the complexity and symbolic meanings of these various carvings, their placement and importance lies in the observer&#x27;s knowledge and connection to the meanings of the figures and the culture in which they are embedded. Contrary to common misconception, they are not worshipped or the subject of spiritual practice.

==History==

Totem poles serve as important illustrations of family lineage and the cultural heritage of the Indigenous peoples in the islands and coastal areas of North America&#x27;s Pacific Northwest, especially British Columbia, Canada, and coastal areas of Washington and southeastern Alaska in the United States. Families of traditional carvers come from the Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Kwakwaka’wakw (Kwakiutl), Nuxalk (Bella Coola), and Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka), among others. The poles are typically carved from the highly rot-resistant trunks of &quot;Thuja plicata&quot; trees (popularly known as giant cedar or western red cedar), which eventually decay in the moist, rainy climate of the coastal Pacific Northwest. Because of the region&#x27;s climate and the nature of the materials used to make the poles, few examples carved before 1900 remain. Noteworthy examples, some dating as far back as 1880, include those at the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, the Museum of Anthropology at UBC in Vancouver, the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, and the Totem Heritage Center in Ketchikan, Alaska.

Totem poles are the largest, but not the only, objects that coastal Pacific Northwest natives use to depict spiritual reverence, family legends, sacred beings and culturally important animals, people, or historical events. The freestanding poles seen by the region&#x27;s first European explorers were likely preceded by a long history of decorative carving. Stylistic features of these poles were borrowed from earlier, smaller prototypes, or from the interior support posts of house beams.

Although 18th-century accounts of European explorers traveling along the coast indicate that decorated interior and exterior house posts existed prior to 1800, the posts were smaller and fewer in number than in subsequent decades. Prior to the 19th century, the lack of efficient carving tools, along with sufficient wealth and leisure time to devote to the craft, delayed the development of elaborately carved, freestanding poles. Before iron and steel arrived in the area, artists used tools made of stone, shells, or beaver teeth for carving. The process was slow and laborious; axes were unknown. By the late eighteenth century, the use of metal cutting tools enabled more complex carvings and increased production of totem poles. The tall monumental poles appearing in front of homes in coastal villages probably did not appear until after the beginning of the nineteenth century.

Eddie Malin has proposed that totem poles progressed from house posts, funerary containers, and memorial markers into symbols of clan and family wealth and prestige. He argues that the Haida people of the islands of Haida Gwaii originated carving of the poles, and that the practice spread outward to the Tsimshian and Tlingit, and then down the coast to the Indigenous people of British Columbia and northern Washington. Malin&#x27;s theory is supported by the photographic documentation of the Pacific Northwest coast&#x27;s cultural history and the more sophisticated designs of the Haida poles.

Accounts from the 1700s describe and illustrate carved poles and timber homes along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. By the early nineteenth century, widespread importation of iron and steel tools from Great Britain, the United States, and elsewhere led to easier and more rapid production of carved wooden goods, including poles.
In the 19th century, American and European trade and settlement initially led to the growth of totem-pole carving, but United States and Canadian policies and practices of acculturation and assimilation caused a decline in the development of Alaska Native and First Nations cultures and their crafts, and sharply reduced totem-pole production by the end of the century. Between 1830 and 1880, the maritime fur trade, mining, and fisheries gave rise to an accumulation of wealth among the coastal peoples. Much of it was spent and distributed in lavish potlatch celebrations, frequently associated with the construction and erection of totem poles. The monumental poles commissioned by wealthy family leaders to represent their social status and the importance of their families and clans. In the 1880s and 1890s, tourists, collectors, scientists and naturalist interested in Indigenous culture collected and photographed totem poles and other artifacts, many of which were put on display at expositions such as the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbia Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, before the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act in 1978, the practice of Indigenous religion was outlawed, and traditional Indigenous cultural practices were also strongly discouraged by Christian missionaries. This included the carving of totem poles. Missionaries urged converts to cease production and destroy existing poles. Nearly all totem-pole-making had ceased by 1901. Carving of monumental and mortuary poles continued in some, more remote villages as late as 1905; however, as the original sites were abandoned, the poles and timber homes were left to decay and vandalism.

Beginning in the late 1930s, a combination of cultural, linguistic, and artistic revivals, along with scholarly interest and the continuing fascination and support of an educated and empathetic public, led to a renewal and extension of this artistic tradition. In 1938 the United States Forest Service began a program to reconstruct and preserve the old poles, salvaging about 200, roughly one-third of those known to be standing at the end of the 19th century. With renewed interest in Indigenous arts and traditions in the 1960s and 1970s, freshly carved totem poles were erected up and down the coast, while related artistic production was introduced in many new and traditional media, ranging from tourist trinkets to masterful works in wood, stone, blown and etched glass, and other traditional and non-traditional media.

In June 2022 during the biennial Celebration festival in Juneau, Alaska, the Sealaska Heritage Institute unveiled the first 360-degree totem pole in Alaska: the &quot;Sealaska Cultural Values Totem Pole&quot;. The structure, carved out of a 600-year-old cedar tree, &quot;represents all three tribes of Southeast Alaska — Lingít, Haida and Tsimshian.&quot;

== Meaning and purpose ==
 
Totem poles can symbolize characters and events in mythology, or convey the experiences of recent ancestors and living people. Some of these characters may appear as stylistic representations of objects in nature, while others are more realistically carved. Pole carvings may include animals, fish, plants, insects, and humans, or they may represent supernatural beings such as the Thunderbird. Some symbolize beings that can transform themselves into another form, appearing as combinations of animals or part-animal/part-human forms. Consistent use of a specific character over time, with some slight variations in carving style, helped develop similarities among these shared symbols that allowed people to recognize one from another. For example, the raven is symbolized by a long, straight beak, while the eagle&#x27;s beak is curved, and a beaver is depicted with two large front teeth, a piece of wood held in his front paws, and a paddle-shaped tail. 
The meanings of the designs on totem poles are as varied as the cultures that make them. Some poles celebrate cultural beliefs that may recount familiar legends, clan lineages, or notable events, while others are mostly artistic. Animals and other characters carved on the pole are typically used as symbols to represent characters or events in a story; however, some may reference the moiety of the pole&#x27;s owner, or simply fill up empty space on the pole. Depictions of thrusting tongues and linked tongues may symbolize socio-political power.

The carved figures interlock one above the other to create the overall design, which may rise to a height of or more. Smaller carvings may be positioned in vacant spaces, or they may be tucked inside the ears or hang out of the mouths of the pole&#x27;s larger figures.
Some of the figures on the poles constitute symbolic reminders of quarrels, murders, debts, and other unpleasant occurrences about which the Native Americans prefer to remain silent... The most widely known tales, like those of the exploits of Raven and of Kats who married the bear woman, are familiar to almost every native of the area. Carvings which symbolize these tales are sufficiently conventionalized to be readily recognizable even by persons whose lineage did not recount them as their own legendary history.

People from cultures that do not carve totem poles often assume that the linear representation of the figures places the most importance on the highest figure, an idea that became pervasive in the dominant culture after it entered into mainstream parlance by the 1930s with the phrase &quot;low man on the totem pole&quot; (and as the title of a bestselling 1941 humor book by H. Allen Smith). However, Native sources either reject the linear component altogether, or reverse the hierarchy, with the most important representations on the bottom, bearing the weight of all the other figures, or at eye-level with the viewer to heighten their significance. Many poles have no vertical arrangement at all, consisting of a lone figure atop an undecorated column.

== Types ==
There are six basic types of upright, pole carvings that are commonly referred to as &quot;totem poles&quot;; not all involve the carving of what may be considered &quot;totem&quot; figures: house frontal poles, interior house posts, mortuary poles, memorial poles, welcome poles, and the ridicule or shame pole.

===House frontal poles===
This type of pole, usually tall is the most decorative. Its carvings tell the story of the family, clan or village who own them. These poles are also known as heraldic, crest, or family poles. Poles of this type are placed outside the clan house of the most important village leaders. Often, watchman figures are carved at the top of the pole to protect the pole owner&#x27;s family and the village. Another type of house frontal pole is the entrance or doorway pole, which is attached to the center front of the home and includes an oval-shaped opening through the base that serves as the entrance to the clan house.

===House posts===
These interior poles, typically in height, are usually shorter than exterior poles. The interior posts support the roof beam of a clan house and include a large notch at the top, where the beam can rest. A clan house may have two to four or more house posts, depending on the cultural group who built it. Carvings on these poles, like those of the house frontal poles, are often used as a storytelling device and help tell the story of the owners&#x27; family history. House posts were carved by the Coast Salish and were more common than the free-standing totem poles seen in Northern cultural groups.

===Mortuary pole===
The rarest type of pole carving is a mortuary structure that incorporates grave boxes with carved supporting poles. It may include a recessed back to hold the grave box. These are among the tallest and most prominent poles, reaching in height. The Haida and Tlingit people erect mortuary poles at the death of important individuals in the community. These poles may have a single figure carved at the top, which may depict the clan&#x27;s crest, but carvings usually cover its entire length. Ashes or the body of the deceased person are placed in the upper portion of the pole.

===Memorial pole===
This type of pole, which usually stands in front of a clan house, is erected about a year after a person has died. The clan chief&#x27;s memorial pole may be raised at the center of the village. The pole&#x27;s purpose is to honor the deceased person and identify the relative who is taking over as his successor within the clan and the community. Traditionally, the memorial pole has one carved figure at the top, but an additional figure may also be added at the bottom of the pole.

Memorial poles may also commemorate an event. For example, several memorial totem poles were erected by the Tlingits in honor of Abraham Lincoln, one of which was relocated to Saxman, Alaska, in 1938. The Lincoln pole at Saxman commemorates the end of hostilities between two rival Tlingit clans and symbolizes the hope for peace and prosperity following the American occupation of the Alaskan territory. The story begins in 1868, when the United States government built a customs house and fort on Tongass Island and left the US revenue cutter &quot;Lincoln&quot; to patrol the area. After American soldiers at the fort and aboard the &quot;Lincoln&quot; provided protection to the Tongass group against its rival, the Kagwantans, the Tongass group commissioned the Lincoln pole to commemorate the event.

===Welcome pole===
Carved by the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw (Kwakiutl), Salish and Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) people, most of the poles include large carvings of human figures, some as tall as . Welcome poles are placed at the edge of a stream or saltwater beach to welcome guests to the community, or possibly to intimidate strangers.

===Shame/ridicule pole===
Poles used for public ridicule are usually called shame poles, and were created to embarrass individuals or groups for their unpaid debts or when they did something wrong. The poles are often placed in prominent locations and removed after the debt is paid or the wrong is corrected. Shame pole carvings represent the person being shamed. 

One famous shame pole is the Seward Pole at the Saxman Totem Park in Saxman, Alaska. Originally carved in the , the pole shamed former U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward for his &quot;lack of recognition of Indigenous peoples at an early point in Alaska’s U.S. history,&quot; as well as not reciprocating the generosity of his Tlingit hosts following an 1869 potlatch given in his honor. The figure&#x27;s red-painted nose and ears may symbolize drunkenness or Seward&#x27;s stinginess. In the 1940s, a second iteration of the pole was built by Tlingit men enrolled in the Civilian Conservation Corps; according to the Alaska Historical Society, the United States government was unaware that the pole&#x27;s intent was to shame Seward until after the completion of the project. In 2014, this second pole began to fall apart; a renewed version was carved in 2017 by local Tlingit artist Stephen Jackson, who combined political caricature with Northwest Coast style.

Another example of the shame pole is the Three Frogs pole on Chief Shakes Island, at Wrangell, Alaska. This pole was erected by Chief Shakes to shame the Kiks.ádi clan into repaying a debt incurred for the support of three Kiks.ádi women who were allegedly cohabiting with three slaves in Shakes&#x27;s household. When the Kiks.ádi leaders refused to pay support for the women, Shakes commissioned a pole with carvings of three frogs, which represented the crest of the Kiks.ádi clan. It is not known if the debt was ever repaid. The pole stands next to the Chief Shakes Tribal House in Wrangell. The pole&#x27;s unique crossbar shape has become popularly associated with the town of Wrangell, and continues to be used as part of the &quot;Wrangell Sentinel&quot; newspaper&#x27;s masthead.

In 1942, the U.S. Forest Service commissioned a pole to commemorate Alexander Baranof, the Russian governor and Russian American Company manager, as a civilian works project. The pole&#x27;s original intent was to commemorate a peace treaty between the Russians and Tlingits that the governor helped broker in 1805. George Benson, a Sitka carver and craftsman, created the original design. The completed version originally stood in Totem Square in downtown Sitka, Alaska. When Benson and other Sitka carvers were not available to do the work, the U.S. Forest Service had CCC workers carve the pole in Wrangell, Alaska. Because Sitka and Wrangell native groups were rivals, it has been argued that the Wrangell carvers may have altered Benson&#x27;s original design. For unknown reasons, the Wrangell carvers depicted the Baranov figure without clothes. Following a Sitka Tribe of Alaska-sponsored removal ceremony, the pole was lowered due to safety concerns on October 20, 2010, using funds from the Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services. The &quot;Sitka Sentinel&quot; reported that while standing, it was &quot;said to be the most photographed totem [pole] in Alaska&quot;. The pole was re-erected in Totem Square in 2011.

On March 24, 2007, a shame pole was erected in Cordova, Alaska, that includes the inverted and distorted face of former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond. The pole represents the unpaid debt of $5 billion in punitive damages that a federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, determined Exxon owes for its role in causing the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound.

==Totem poles outside of original context==

Some poles from the Pacific Northwest have been moved to other locations for display out of their original context.

In 1903 Alaska&#x27;s district governor, John Green Brady, collected fifteen Tlingit and Haida totem poles for public displays from villages in southeastern Alaska. At the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (the world&#x27;s fair held in Saint Louis, Missouri, in 1904), fourteen of them were initially installed outside the Alaska pavilion at the fair; the other one, which had broken in transit, was repaired and installed at the fair&#x27;s Esquimau Village. Thirteen of these poles were returned to Alaska, where they were eventually installed in the Sitka National Historical Park. The other two poles were sold; one pole from the Alaska pavilion went to the Milwaukee Public Museum and the pole from the Esquimau Village was sold and then given to industrialist David M. Parry, who installed it on his estate in what became known as the Golden Hill neighborhood of Indianapolis, Indiana. Although the remains of the original pole at Golden Hill no longer exist, a replica was raised on April 13, 1996, on the front lawn of The Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis. Approximately two years later, the replica was moved inside the museum, and in 2005, it was installed in a new atrium after completion of a museum expansion project.

===Indian New Deal===
The Indian New Deal of the 1930s strongly promoted native arts and crafts in the United States, and in the totem pole they discovered an art that was widely appreciated by white society. In Alaska the Indian Division of the Civilian Conservation Corps restored old totem poles, copied those beyond repair, and carved new ones. The Indian Arts and Crafts Board, a U.S. federal government agency, facilitated their sale to the general public. The project was lucrative, but anthropologists complained that it stripped the natives of their traditional culture and stripped away the meaning of the totem poles.

Another example occurred in 1938, when the U.S. Forest Service began a totem pole restoration program in Alaska. Poles were removed from their original places as funerary and crest poles to be copied or repaired and then placed in parks based on English and French garden designs to demystify their meaning for tourists.

In England at the side of Virginia Water Lake, in the south of Windsor Great Park, there is a Canadian totem pole that was given to Queen Elizabeth II to commemorate the centenary of British Columbia. In Seattle, Washington, a Tlingit funerary totem pole was raised in Pioneer Square in 1899, after being taken from an Alaskan village. In addition, the totem pole collections in Vancouver&#x27;s Stanley Park, Victoria&#x27;s Thunderbird Park, and the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia were removed from their original locations around British Columbia. In Stanley Park, the original Skedans Mortuary Pole has been returned to Haida Gwaii and is now replaced by a replica. In the late 1980s, the remaining carved poles were sent to various museums for preservation, with the park board commissioning and loaning replacement carvings.

==Construction and maintenance==

After the tree to be used for the totem pole is selected, it is cut down and moved to the carving site, where the bark and outer layer of wood (sapwood) is removed. Next, the side of the tree to be carved is chosen and the back half of the tree is removed. The center of the log is hollowed out to make it lighter and to keep it from cracking. Early tools used to carve totem poles were made of stone, shell, or bone, but beginning in the late 1700s, the use of iron tools made the carving work faster and easier. In the early days, the basic design for figures may have been painted on the wood to guide the carvers, but today&#x27;s carvers use paper patterns as outlines for their designs. Carvers use chain saws to make the rough shapes and cuts, while adzes and chisels are used to chop the wood. Carvers use knives and other woodworking tools to add the finer details. When the carving is complete, paint is added to enhance specific details of the figures.

Raising a totem pole is rarely done using modern methods, even for poles installed in modern settings. Most artists use a traditional method followed by a pole-raising ceremony. The traditional method calls for a deep trench to be dug. One end of the pole is placed at the bottom of the trench; the other end is supported at an upward angle by a wooden scaffold. Hundreds of strong men haul the pole upright into its footing, while others steady the pole from side ropes and brace it with cross beams. Once the pole is upright, the trench is filled with rocks and dirt. After the raising is completed, the carver, the carver&#x27;s assistants, and others invited to attend the event perform a celebratory dance next to the pole. A community potlatch celebration typically follows the pole raising to commemorate the event. 
Totem poles are typically not well maintained after their installation and the potlatch celebration. The poles usually last from 60 to 80 years; only a few have stood longer than 75 years, and even fewer have reached 100 years of age. Once the wood rots so badly that the pole begins to lean and pose a threat to passersby, it is either destroyed or pushed over and removed. Older poles typically fall over during the winter storms that batter the coast. The owners of a collapsed pole may commission a new one to replace it.

==Cultural property==
Each culture typically has complex rules and customs regarding the traditional designs represented on poles. The designs are generally considered the property of a particular clan or family group of traditional carvers, and this ownership of the designs may not be transferred to the person who has commissioned the carvings. There have been protests when those who have not been trained in the traditional carving methods, cultural meanings and protocol, have made &quot;fake totem poles&quot; for what could be considered crass public display and commercial purposes. The misappropriation of coastal Pacific Northwest culture by the art and tourist trinket market has resulted in production of cheap imitations of totem poles executed with little or no knowledge of their complex stylistic conventions or cultural significance. These include imitations made for commercial and even comedic use in venues that serve alcohol, and in other settings that are insensitive or outright offensive to the sacred nature of some of the carvings.

In the early 1990s, the Haisla First Nation of the Pacific Northwest began a lengthy struggle to repatriate the Gʼpsgolox totem pole from Sweden&#x27;s Museum of Ethnography. Their successful efforts were documented in Gil Cardinal&#x27;s National Film Board of Canada documentary, &quot;Totem: The Return of the G&#x27;psgolox Pole&quot;.

In October 2015, a Tlingit totem pole was returned from Hawaii to Alaska after being taken from a village by Hollywood actor John Barrymore in 1931.

==Examples==
The title of &quot;The World&#x27;s Tallest Totem Pole&quot; is or has at one time been claimed by several coastal towns of North America&#x27;s Pacific Northwest. Disputes over which is genuinely the tallest depends on factors such the number of logs used in construction or the affiliation of the carver. Competitions to make the tallest pole remain prevalent, although it is becoming more difficult to procure trees of sufficient height. The tallest poles include those in:
* Alert Bay, British Columbia—, Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw. This pole is composed of two or three pieces.
* McKinleyville, California—, carved from a single redwood tree by Ernest Pierson and John Nelson.
* Kalama, Washington—, carved from a single pole by Lelooska.
* Kake, Alaska—, single log carving, Tlingit
* Victoria, British Columbia (Beacon Hill Park)—, raised in 1956, Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw, carved by Mungo Martin with Henry Hunt and David Martin.
* Tacoma, Washington (Fireman&#x27;s Park)—, carved by Alaska Natives in 1903.
* Vancouver, British Columbia (Maritime Museum) —, Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw, carved by Mungo Martin with Henry Hunt and David Martin.

The thickest totem pole ever carved to date is in Duncan, British Columbia. Carved by Richard Hunt in 1988 in the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw style, and measuring over in diameter, it represents Cedar Man transforming into his human form.

<doc id="74154" wikidata="Q375671" url="?curid=74154" title="Poison Ivy (character)">
<text>Poison Ivy is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Carmine Infantino, she debuted in &quot;Batman&quot; #181 (June 1966) and has become one of the superhero Batman&#x27;s most enduring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.

In her comic book appearances, Poison Ivy is depicted as a doctor of botany-turned-misanthropic ecoterrorist in Gotham City named Pamela Lillian Isley, PhD ( ) with the ability to control all plant life. Empowered by an elemental force known as the &quot;Green&quot;, Ivy attempts to protect the sanctity and supremacy of nature at all costs by lashing out against humanity, which brings her into conflict with Batman. While usually portrayed as a supervillain, Ivy has also been an antiheroine at times as well as the primary love interest of Harley Quinn as of The New 52 and DC Rebirth relaunches. A one-piece costume adorned with leaves and vines serves as Poison Ivy&#x27;s visual motif.

Poison Ivy has been adapted in various media incarnations, having been portrayed by Uma Thurman in the 1997 film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;; Clare Foley, Maggie Geha and Peyton List in the Fox television series &quot;Gotham&quot;; and Bridget Regan in The CW&#x27;s Arrowverse series &quot;Batwoman&quot;. Diane Pershing, Tasia Valenza, Lake Bell, Tara Strong, and others have provided the character&#x27;s voice ranging from animation to video games.
==Publication history==
Poison Ivy was created by Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino; the character first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #181 (June 1966). Infantino discussed how the character was created: &quot;The only reason she came about was because of Catwoman on the Batman show. They wanted more female villains. What was the other one I did... the Silver Fox! And then Batgirl. That show, because of it we were selling a million copies a month. But that show, when it died, so did the comic books.&quot;

Poison Ivy&#x27;s origin is depicted in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s short story &quot;Pavane&quot; (&quot;Secret Origins&quot; #36, 1988), during which she declares herself to be nature&#x27;s daughter and the world&#x27;s rightful ruler; it is later revealed that her powers were gifted to her by the environmental force known as the Green. Ivy is considered extremely beautiful within the DC Universe, and is often presented as a temptress. She is typically depicted barefoot with long flowing hair, plant vines extending over her limbs, and a green one-piece suit adorned with leaves, with occasional variations to her skin tone.

Writer J. T. Krul, who helped further define Poison Ivy&#x27;s personality, summed up her character with the following quote:
After appearing in various DC Comics publications, Poison Ivy starred in her first solo comic book series with the 2016 miniseries &quot;Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death&quot;. This was followed by the 2021 graphic novel &quot;Poison Ivy: Thorns&quot;, and the eponymously titled &quot;Poison Ivy&quot;, an ongoing comic book series first published in 2022. The character also co-starred in the miniseries &quot;Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy&quot; (20192020).

==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-Crisis===
Dr. Lillian Rose, PhD is a promising botanist who is persuaded by Marc LeGrand into assisting him with the theft of an Egyptian artifact containing ancient herbs. Fearing she would implicate him in the theft, he attempts to poison her with the herbs, which are deadly and untraceable. She survives this murder attempt and discovers she has acquired an immunity to all natural toxins and diseases.

===Post-Crisis===
Following the events of the DC maxi-series comic &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, which massively retconned DC Universe history and continuity, Poison Ivy&#x27;s origins were revised in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; #36, 1988, written by Neil Gaiman. Her real name is Dr. Pamela Isley, PhD, a Gotham City botanist. She grows up wealthy with emotionally distant parents and later studies advanced botanical biochemistry at a university with Alec Holland under Dr. Jason Woodrue. Isley, a shy girl, is easily seduced by her professor. Woodrue injects Isley with poisons and toxins as an experiment, causing her transformation. She nearly dies twice as a result of these poisonings, driving her insane. Later, Woodrue flees from the authorities leaving Isley in the hospital for six months. Enraged at the betrayal, she suffers from violent mood swings, being sweet one moment and evil the next. When her boyfriend has a car accident after mysteriously suffering from a massive fungal overgrowth, Isley drops out of school and leaves Seattle, eventually settling in Gotham City.

She begins her criminal career by threatening to release her suffocating spores into the air unless the city meets her demands. Batman, who appears in Gotham that very same year, thwarts her scheme, and she is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum. From this point on, she has a kind of obsession with Batman, him being the only person she could not control due to his strong will and focus. Over the years, she develops plant-like superpowers, the most noticeable being a lethal toxin in her lips; she is literally able to kill with a kiss.

In subsequent issues, she states that she only started a life of crime to attain sufficient funds to find a location to be alone with her plants, undisturbed by humanity. A few years later, she attempts to leave Gotham forever, escaping Arkham to settle on a desert island in the Caribbean. She transforms the barren wasteland into a second Eden, and is, for the first time in her life, happy. It is soon firebombed, however, when an American-owned corporation tests their weapons systems out on what they think is an abandoned island. Ivy returns to Gotham with a vengeance, punishing those responsible. After being willingly apprehended by Batman, she resolves that she can never leave Gotham, at least not until the world was safe for plants. From then on, she dedicates herself to the impossible mission of &quot;purifying&quot; Gotham.

At one point, Batman travels to Seattle to ascertain information on Pamela Isley&#x27;s life before she became Poison Ivy. Here, Batman states that both of Pamela&#x27;s parents are dead. When and why they died has been left undetermined.

While in Arkham, Poison Ivy receives a message through flowers that someone is to help her escape. That night, two women, Holly and Eva, successfully break Ivy out and bring her back to their employer. She is less than happy to discover that it is the Floronic Man, formerly known as Dr. Jason Woodrue, her former college professor that conducted the experiments on her. The only human portion of him remaining is his head, while the rest of his body is plant-based.

After striking a deal with him in the tunnels of Gotham, Ivy receives a trunk full of money in return for samples of her DNA. Woodrue intends to combine their DNA to create a &quot;child&quot;, all while flooding the streets of Gotham with high-grade marijuana. The purpose of this is to create a world economy run on hemp and to have their offspring control it. Batman intervenes, but is overcome by Woodrue&#x27;s henchwomen, Holly and Eva. However, Ivy turns on Floronic Man and lets Batman go to fight the intoxicated maniac. In the end, Batman decapitates the Floronic Man, and Ivy escapes with her money.

At times, Ivy demonstrates positive and maternal traits. When Gotham City is destroyed in an and declared , she holds dominion over Robinson Park and turns it into a tropical paradise rather than fight over territory like most of Batman&#x27;s enemies. Sixteen children who are orphaned during the quake come to live with her as she sympathizes with them having suffered a traumatic childhood herself. She cares for them like sons and daughters, despite her usual misanthropy. That winter, Clayface (Basil Karlo) pays Ivy a visit, hoping to form a bargain with her. This would entail her growing fruits and vegetables, having the orphans harvest them, and him selling the produce to the highest bidder. She wants nothing to do with the plan, and she attempts to kill him with a kiss. Clayface overpowers her, however, and imprisons Ivy and the orphans for six months in a chamber under the park&#x27;s lake. He feeds her salt and keeps her from the sun to weaken her. Eventually, Batman comes and discovers the imprisoned orphans and Ivy. The two agree to work together to take Karlo down. Batman battles Clayface and instructs Robin to blow up the lake bed above, allowing the rushing water to break apart the mud, effectively freeing Ivy. She fights Karlo, ensnaring him in the branches of a tree and fatally kissing him. She then proceeds to sink him down into the ground, where he becomes fertilizer for Ivy&#x27;s plants. Batman, originally intending to take the orphans away from Ivy, recognizes that staying with her is what is best for them, and they remain in her care until the city is restored. Also, as part of a bargain to keep her freedom, Batman arranges it so that Ivy provides fresh produce to the starving hordes of earthquake survivors. Soon after, Ivy finds Harley Quinn, who had almost been murdered by the Joker, among the debris of the earthquake and nurses her back to health. The two have been best friends and partners-in-crime ever since.

After Gotham City is reopened to the public, the city council wants to evict her from the park and send her back to Arkham Asylum, as they are uncomfortable with the thought of a &quot;psychotic eco-terrorist controlling the equivalent of 30-odd square blocks.&quot; They also mistakenly believe that the orphans in Ivy&#x27;s care are hostages. The Gotham City Police Department threaten to spray the park with R.C. Sixty, a powerful herbicide that most certainly would have killed every living plant in the park, including Ivy, and more than likely do harm to the children. Ivy refuses to leave the park to the city and let them destroy the paradise she had created, so she chooses martyrdom. It is only after Rose, one of the orphans, is accidentally poisoned by Ivy that the hardened eco-terrorist surrenders herself to the authorities to save the girl&#x27;s life. Batman says that, as much as she would hate to admit it, Ivy is still more human than plant.

Later on, she and other Gotham characters are manipulated by the Riddler and Hush. Her task is to hypnotize both Superman and Catwoman, using Catwoman to steal ransom money from Bane after the original plan is interrupted by Batman while Superman serves as a &#x27;bodyguard&#x27; when she hides in Metropolis. However, she abandons Catwoman to be killed by Killer Croc, and Batman is able to keep Superman busy in a fight (aided by the Kryptonite ring he was given long ago) long enough for him to escape Ivy&#x27;s control. Soon afterwards, the Riddler, who is being chased and attacked by Hush, approaches Ivy and seeks her protection. Ivy, who is angered by the manipulation, battles the Riddler physically and psychologically. She comes to physically dominate her opponent, humiliating Riddler and temporarily breaking his spirit.

Ivy comes to believe that her powers are killing the children she had looked after, so with Bruce Wayne&#x27;s help, she willingly undergoes treatment to become human again. Soon after, she is convinced by Hush to take another serum to restore her powers and apparently dies in the process. However, in &quot;Batman: Gotham Knights&quot;, when her grave is visited shortly thereafter, it is covered with ivy, creating the impression her death would be short-lived.

Shortly after, Poison Ivy appears briefly in Robinson Park, killing two corrupt cops who killed one of her orphans (although whether this takes place before or after the aforementioned storyline is unknown).

&quot;One Year Later&quot;, Ivy is alive and active. Her control over flora has increased, referred to as being on a par with Swamp Thing or Floronic Man. She also appears to have resumed her crusade against the corporate enemies of the environment with a new fanaticism, regarding Batman no longer as a main opponent, but as a &quot;hindrance&quot;. After arriving back from a year-long absence, Batman discovers that Ivy has been feeding people including &quot;tiresome lovers&quot;, &quot;incompetent henchmen&quot;, and those who &quot;returned her smile&quot; to a giant plant which would digest the victims slowly and painfully. She refers to these murders as a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot;. In an unprecedented event, her victims&#x27; souls merge with the plant, creating a botanical monster called &quot;Harvest&quot;, who seeks revenge upon Poison Ivy. With the intervention of Batman however, she is saved. Poison Ivy is left in critical condition, and the whereabouts of Harvest are unknown.

===Other storylines===
In &quot;Countdown&quot; #37, the Pied Piper and the Trickster are hiding out in a greenhouse, picking fruits and vegetables from the plants. They run into Ivy, who is talking to her plants (presumably being told that Piper and Trickster hurt them), to which she reacts by tying them up in vines with the intention of killing them. She is then shown to have joined the Injustice League Unlimited and is one of the villains featured in &quot;Salvation Run&quot;.

In the &quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot; storyline, she is coerced by a new Black Mask into joining his group of villains that aims to take over Gotham. She and Killer Croc unsuccessfully attempt to murder Damian Wayne.

Shortly after, she escapes from Black Mask&#x27;s control and forms an alliance with Catwoman and Harley Quinn, leading into the ongoing series &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot;.

During Hush&#x27;s ploy to hurt Batman through hurting his loved ones, Hush kidnaps Catwoman and surgically removes her heart. After being saved by Batman, Catwoman is operated on by some of the most gifted surgeons in the world, including Doctor Mid-Nite and Mr. Terrific. Zatanna also gives her a magic antidote to help heal her wounds. To get even with Hush, Selina enlists the help of Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Oracle, Holly Robinson, and Slam Bradley to track down all of Hush&#x27;s accounts, pilfer them, and leave him penniless. Selina pays Holly, Harley, and Ivy over $30 million each, hoping that they would use the funds to leave Gotham to start fresh somewhere else. However, Harley uses her money to go on a shopping spree, while Ivy gives her money away to organizations in Madagascar and Costa Rica dedicated to reforestation.

After rescuing Catwoman from Boneblaster, a new villain trying to make a name for himself, Poison Ivy takes Catwoman back to the Riddler&#x27;s townhouse. When there, Catwoman sees that Ivy has been keeping the Riddler under mind control so that she and Harley could use his townhouse as a hideout. Here, Catwoman decides that with Gotham City more dangerous than ever with all the gang wars and a new Batman, a partnership with the other two women would be advantageous. However, Ivy fears that Catwoman has lost her edge and prowess, and consults with Zatanna on the nature of Catwoman&#x27;s injuries. Zatanna responds that Catwoman has psychological wounds that would need healing. Ivy resolves that she and Harley would provide Catwoman with &quot;positive female reinforcement&quot;. The three then agree to become a team. However, Harley and Ivy have one condition that Catwoman is to reveal to them Batman&#x27;s secret identity.

Eventually, Ivy and the other Sirens ambush the Riddler at his office (with Ivy using her plants to truss and gag his secretary), telling him that they&#x27;ve been framed for the murder of a young nurse. He agrees to help clear their names, and during the discussion Ivy reveals that she has recently taken up a job at the Gotham division of S.T.A.R. Labs under an assumed name (Dr. Paula Irving). She is eventually kidnapped and placed in a specialized containment unit by a researcher named Alisa Adams, but escapes and turns the table on her captor by binding her with vines. Ivy initially informs Adams that she plans to kill her, but instead decides to let her live after seeing a photograph of Alisa&#x27;s young daughter. Ivy then threatens Alisa into keeping her mouth shut about her true identity, telling her that she will change her mind and kill her if she reveals her secret to anyone.

When Harley Quinn betrays her friends and breaks into Arkham Asylum with the goal of killing the Joker, she ultimately chooses instead to release Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility. Poison Ivy arrives and tries to convince Harley Quinn that the Joker is evil, but Harley Quinn refuses to believe her and knocks Poison Ivy unconscious. After they are defeated by Catwoman and Batman, Catwoman then tells Poison Ivy that they are no longer friends, after Ivy had drugged Catwoman in an attempt to discover Batman&#x27;s identity. Poison Ivy is taken to Arkham Asylum. Ivy soon escapes and ambushes Harley in her cell, binding and gagging her former friend before she can defend herself. Ivy struggles with the decision to execute Harley for her betrayal, but ultimately releases her after realizing that she is still her friend. Together, the two set off to find Catwoman and make her pay for leaving them behind. The two of them find Catwoman and fight her on the streets. While fighting, Catwoman confesses that she saw good in the both of them and only wanted to help them. When she tells them that she only kept tabs on them because Batman wanted to keep them under control, Ivy lashes out onto the city by using giant vines to destroy buildings, cursing at Batman for manipulating her. Batman is about to arrest them, but Catwoman helps the two of them escape.

===The New 52===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. Poison Ivy is recruited into the covert-ops group known as the Birds of Prey. Though she is specifically hand-picked by the team&#x27;s leader, Black Canary, the other members of the group protest Ivy&#x27;s inclusion, citing her violent past and connections to various murders. These suspicions are proven correct when Ivy poisons the team and forces them to attack corrupt companies she wants to destroy, until Katana apparently kills her.

Ivy survives the injuries and returns to Gotham, breaking out Clayface/Basil Karlo to manipulate him into becoming her husband. Batman intervenes to help her, mainly because the locations she attacked were the Penguin&#x27;s properties. Poison Ivy ends up captured by Penguin&#x27;s men. She is buried alive by them, but survives long enough to be rescued by Penguin&#x27;s right-hand man Emperor Penguin who has taken over his boss&#x27; businesses after the Joker&#x27;s return. He proposes an alliance with her. However, Karlo, whom Batman had set free from Ivy&#x27;s control, tracks down and attacks Poison Ivy. Emperor Penguin later calls in a favor from Poison Ivy. This led to Emperor Penguin empowering himself with a chemical that is made from one of Poison Ivy&#x27;s plant concoctions, the Man-Bat Serum, and the Venom drug.

The character&#x27;s origin, in this new DC universe, was presented in a special issue of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (#23.1), during the &quot;Villains Month&quot; event in September 2013. Pamela Isley was born with a skin condition that prevented her from leaving her home. She spent most of her limited time outside in her family&#x27;s garden. Her abusive father murdered her mother and buried her in the garden. While in college, Pamela sold pheromone pills to other students to study its effects until she was caught by police. She used a powerful version of the pills to control the dean&#x27;s mind so he would drop the charges and let her graduate with honors. While visiting her father in prison, she kissed him, and the poison that was secreted from her lips killed him. Later she landed an internship in Wayne Enterprises&#x27; Bio-Chemistry Division developing pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. She was fired after Bruce Wayne discovered her using company resources for an unauthorized project to brainwash people through plant pheromones. In an accident similar to that which created Mr. Freeze, Pamela attacks the security guards sent to escort her out and is exposed to lethal doses of her chemicals, triggering a mutation that gives her green skin, immunity to all toxins, and the ability to manipulate plant life.

===&quot;Cycle of Life and Death&quot;===

In January 2016, DC Comics debuted Ivy&#x27;s first solo comic book series, &quot;Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death&quot;. The series begins with Ivy attempting to go straight by returning to her science career. Under her human identity of Dr. Pamela Isley, she joins the plant sciences department at the famed Gotham Botanical Gardens, but things quickly get complicated when Luisa Cruz, Ivy&#x27;s friend and mentor, is murdered via poisoning. Ivy investigates the murder whilst completing a genetic engineering research project begun by Cruz that culminates in the creation of two plant-human hybrid children known as Rose and Hazel.

With the help of Selina Kyle and fellow researcher Darshan, Poison Ivy finds that the Gotham Botanical Gardens are performing experiments, using Ivy&#x27;s research, which result in the creation of another plant-human hybrid child known as Thorn. Ivy destroys the laboratory and rescues the child. Ivy raises Rose, Hazel and Thorn who grow to adult size at an exponential rate, becoming young women within 35 weeks. When the girls sneak out to see Gotham City at night for the first time, they cause an incident at a strip club that gets the police involved, and Ivy has to help them escape.

Returning to the apartment, Ivy locks Rose, Hazel and Thorn away so they will not leave again. Ivy finds Doctor Eric Grimley, Chair of the Gotham Botanical Gardens Research Department, waiting for her. Grimley had been conducting experiments with Ivy&#x27;s research to cure his own cancer; he had then murdered Luisa because she was suspicious of the experiments he was performing. Now, with his cancer returning, he intends to harvest Rose, Thorn, and Hazel for spores to be used as another cure. He attacks Ivy, and transforms into a giant, plant-like monster. Darshan arrives and releases the girls. Ivy, Rose, Hazel, Thorn, and Darshan, along with Swamp Thing (who seeks to kill Grimley for trying to break the cycle of life and death) fight and defeat Grimley, with Thorn hacking him up with a machete.

Darshan later helps Rose, Thorn, and Hazel leave Ivy, reasoning that they were getting so restless they would go eventually with or without his help. They set off away from Gotham to places unknown, saying they plan to live out their lives regardless of how short they may be.

===DC Universe===
DC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles, called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, in June 2016. DC opted to rebrand its titles under the &quot;DC Universe&quot; name in December 2017, using the continuity established from DC Rebirth. In the &quot;Better Together&quot; story arc of &quot;Trinity&quot;, Poison Ivy finds a dreamworld and the White Mercy entity, both created by the Black Mercy plant for Mongul, through her connection to the Green. After capturing Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman, she places them into the dreamworld and intends to use the solar energy emitted from Superman&#x27;s body to open a gateway to bring the White Mercy—whom she considers as a daughter—over from the dreamworld. It is later revealed that Mongul deceived Poison Ivy and intended to conquer Earth using Superman as a vessel. Mongul is defeated by the White Mercy, using Batman as a temporary and willing vessel. As Poison Ivy and the White Mercy bid farewell to each other, the White Mercy uses her connection to the Green to make Poison Ivy lose her memories of the incident, so Ivy doesn&#x27;t need to suffer any heartache. In the continuity, the &quot;Better Together&quot; story arc takes place after the events in &quot;Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death&quot; involving Ivy&#x27;s children.

In &quot;Batgirl&quot;, Poison Ivy helps Batgirl save an airplane and its passengers from a plant, one of Ivy&#x27;s specimen, that is growing uncontrollably in the cargo bay. In the end, she reluctantly allows Batgirl to kill it.

In the &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; arc of &quot;All-Star Batman&quot;, Poison Ivy goes into Death Valley where she conducts research on a barren tree to discover cures. Here, Batman asks Poison Ivy for help with a deadly bacteria, which was unleashed by Mr. Freeze, informing her about an infected girl and giving her samples of it. Upon examining it, Ivy realizes that the infected girl is already dead and Batman wanted to evoke her sympathy as he is actually seeking for a cure to combat the spread of the disease. She also reveals that, when she was still working at Wayne Enterprises, she had presented her research wrongly as she thought Bruce Wayne wanted something to manipulate people but she was actually researching pheromones to make people feel good. Batman warns Ivy that an unknown strike force is after her, because they know Ivy is able to pull biological weapons from the tree. After Batman helps Ivy in the fight, Ivy synthesizes a selective agent that can destroy the spores without harming the hosts.

In &quot;The War of Jokes and Riddles&quot; story arc of &quot;Batman&quot;, Poison Ivy has allied herself with the Riddler in his war against the Joker. In the arc, when the Riddler was trying to convince her to join his side, she is seen stopping Carmine Falcone&#x27;s men—who are sent to kill the Riddler—by capturing them in vines.

In the &quot;Gotham Resistance&quot; tie-in story arc for &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot;, Poison Ivy controls a jungle-like realm within a Gotham City warped by the dark energy emitted from the dark metal in the cards given by the Batman Who Laughs to various enemies of Batman including Poison Ivy herself. Poison Ivy captures Harley Quinn—who realizes that Poison Ivy isn&#x27;t herself—Green Arrow, Nightwing, Robin, and Killer Croc as they try to solve what&#x27;s going on and stop it. They escape when Poison Ivy violently reacts to her plants being harmed during an attack by several members of the Teen Titans and Suicide Squad, who all also have been twisted, as well as a Dark Robin.

In the &quot;Source Code&quot; story arc of &quot;Batgirl and the Birds of Prey&quot;, Poison Ivy infiltrates and tries to take down Terracare, a company whose fertilizers contain a secret ingredient destructive to bee populations. She comes across the Birds of Prey (Huntress, Black Canary, and Batgirl) and Catwoman who were trying to save the Calculator&#x27;s family held hostage by Terracare. Terracare had namely traced back a data breach to the Calculator who sold the information to Catwoman, so she could steal a vial of the ingredient from Terracare for Poison Ivy. She did this for Ivy, as Ivy once saved her from Boneblaster. After they stopped those responsible at Terracare, Batgirl arranges that Poison Ivy becomes the chemist in charge of the fertilizers. After this arc, Poison Ivy is occasionally seen working at Terracare (now acquired by Gordon Clean Energy) or helping the Birds of Prey against villains (such as the Daughters of Gotham or the Calculator).

In the &quot;Unnatural Disaster&quot; storyline of &quot;Damage&quot;, Poison Ivy has fallen under the influence of forces that led to a desire to destroy humanity. She partnered with Gorilla Grodd for that purpose. They fought against Damage (Ethan Avery) who is trying to protect people from them. However, Poison Ivy eventually resists the control of these forces, as she thinks that people are worth saving and doesn&#x27;t want to be a killer. At the end, Swamp Thing (Alec Holland) reveals to Ethan Avery that the Green is trying to change Poison Ivy but hasn&#x27;t succeeded.

&quot;Batman&quot; (vol. 3) #41–43 features a Poison Ivy arc titled &quot;Everyone Loves Ivy&quot;. Fueled by her guilt over the men she thought she killed in &quot;The War of Jokes and Riddles&quot;, Poison Ivy uses her powers to take control of everyone on earth, except Batman and Catwoman. With the help of Harley Quinn, Batman and Catwoman convince Poison Ivy to release the world from her control. At the end of arc, Poison Ivy enters a facility known as the Sanctuary for rehabilitation.

In &quot;Heroes in Crisis&quot;, at the mental health institution Sanctuary, Poison Ivy is seen giving a confession in which she states that she shouldn&#x27;t be there because they are made for heroes and she is a terrorist. Earlier, Harley Quinn had told Poison Ivy to go to Sanctuary and followed her there. Ivy and several others are killed when Wally West loses control of the Speed Force, but Wally revives Ivy from the Green by using the Speed Force on a rose that was a part of Ivy given to Harley. The following &quot;Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy&quot; limited series shows Ivy still struggling to completely regenerate. With Harley&#x27;s aid, Ivy is eventually restored fully, but accidentally creates an identical plant duplicate of herself during her recovery. Both innocently unaware of being a duplicate, the Ivy-double and Harley go on the run together when enemies attack, leaving behind the real Ivy feeling abandoned and betrayed. By the time the pair learn of their mistake, Ivy is murderously insane towards Harley, forcing the double to sacrifice herself to save Harley and stabilize Ivy&#x27;s sanity.

===&quot;Harley Quinn&quot; comic===
&quot;Harley Quinn&quot; features Ivy as Harley&#x27;s best friend and then lover. Ivy has helped Harley out on several adventures between her ecological terrorism gigs back in Harley&#x27;s new home on Coney Island. She helps Harley explain to the local assassins that Harley posted her own bounty while sleepwalking and that trying to kill her would just lead to their deaths and no pay day. Harley rescued her from a super villain&#x27;s mind control while Ivy was secretly held prisoner and used by said villain in Arkham. She assisted in hiring the Gang of Harleys and nursing Harley back to health when Captain Strong&#x27;s seaweed put her in the hospital. She and Catwoman joined Harley on a road trip when Harley&#x27;s uncle died and found that while both she and Harley are immune to most toxins, that does not include some secret drink brewed up on an Indian reservation. She and Harley were invited to spend a romantic week in Bermuda on a nudist colony by Sy Borgman. When there was a dispute over some real estate Ivy helped turn it into protected swampland. Also, when the Penguin attacks New York with giant killer penguins, she helps defeat him by growing a giant daisy in what their friend Eggy calls &quot;the worst Kaiju fight ever.&quot;

Tee Franklin, one of the writers of the &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; comics, has stated that she wrote Ivy as autistic, but &quot;figured DC would be against&quot; this being mentioned in the comics.

==Activism==
Ivy calls herself an &quot;ecoterrorist of global importance&quot; and has demonstrated philanthropic contributions to conservation efforts. The &quot;Gotham Girls&quot; episode &quot;Pave Paradise&quot; has her going out of her way to get Gotham&#x27;s mayor to prevent bulldozing of a park because he swore he would not do it in his election campaign. In &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot;, Ivy reveals that she donated her $30 million share of Hush&#x27;s money to a reforestation fund.

==Powers and abilities==
Initially thought to have been transformed by human experiments, Isley is later revealed to be gifted by the Green, an interplanetary force which grants her a supernatural control over plant life, enhanced strength and stamina, the power to transfer poison through touch, complete immunity to all toxins and poisons, and the ability to project mind-controlling pheromones. With the latter power at its full potential, she proves capable of controlling every person on Earth, including other super-powered beings. If her mind-control spores are laced with Kryptonite, Ivy can affect and control Superman as well.

She has the ability to control and mutate all forms of plant life on a molecular level, making it respond to her will and command. In volume three of &quot;Batman&quot;, she causes giant plant roots to become uprooted at a moment&#x27;s notice, and directs them to entangle her enemies. While in Arkham Asylum, she manipulates and animates plants, using roots to form supports for a tunnel she and another inmate named Magpie dig to escape, and also spawning glowing fungi to entertain Magpie. Plant vines are also commonly seen extending over her limbs and neck, creating part of her overall appearance. She controlled an entire tree to come down on Clayface, ensnaring him in its branches, and once brought a whole skyscraper down with giant vines.

Some versions of the character depict her as more plant than human, such as breathing carbon dioxide and undergoing photosynthesis. Her special pheromones let her mesmerize and manipulate people around her, men in particular, although strong-minded people like Batman are usually capable of resisting. She can also create the most potent floral toxins in Gotham City, ranging from truth serums to love potions. Often these toxins are secreted from her lips and administered in her preferred way, a poisonous kiss. Ironically her immunity to poisons has resulted in her becoming sterile and unable to give birth.

Poison Ivy is identified by the Swamp Thing as a being with an elemental mystical component, whom he calls the &quot;May Queen&quot;. Ivy is able to communicate over great distances with this talent, as she manifests in a vase of roses in Zatanna&#x27;s dressing room to talk to the magician. Since her death and rebirth, her control over plants increased to the point she can grow giant animated plants from seedlings in seconds, hear through plants, and channel her consciousness into plant material from long distances.

The character carries a certain number of live vines: coupled with her natural ability to commune with plant life, they act as weaponry, or defensive/grabbing appendages. Their supply is, however, limited.

Beyond her metahuman traits, Ivy is shown to be exceptionally physically fit both due to gymnastics and her enhanced health; being both similar to Harley Quinn in skill as well as showing enough hand-to-hand combat prowess to challenge Batman without relying solely on her powers.

Pamela Isley is an expert in botany, toxicology and genetics. Though mentally unstable, she has a genius level of intelligence, particularly when it comes to anything related to plants, and she may be the world&#x27;s foremost botanist. Her specialization in these fields had earned her a career as a scientist and she initially used her knowledge for perfumes, makeup and medicine. Additionally, her expertise in biochemistry has enabled her to develop mutant plants and to create and give life to plants that have long been thought to be extinct. In &quot;Batman&quot; The Animated Series&quot;, a captive Batman calls her a genius combined with a fanatic – a description she does not dispute.

She is famous for being able to seduce men and women alike, often using her pheromones to do so, but also without: her beauty is a resource she can use. Pamela Isley has always been a beautiful woman, but she never used her looks or talents for personal gain until she became Poison Ivy.

==Romantic relationships==
===Batman===
Ivy and Batman have worked together in achieving common goals and are frequently depicted as having a romantic relationship. Batman&#x27;s attraction to Ivy is present in some way in several mediums in which the characters appear. There has always been a sexual tension between the two, most notably in their canonical earlier encounters.

In her first appearance, Ivy is established as having an attraction to Batman, and tries to convince Batman to join her side and creates love potions that ensnare him.

In the 1997 story &quot;Batman: Poison Ivy&quot;, Christopher DeJardin tries to kill Ivy, and Batman takes the bullet. Batman, who was wearing body armor, knocks him out. Ivy considers his saving her from death as proof he loves her, though he responds that she does not know the meaning of the word.

Her attraction is confirmed in &quot;&quot;.

At first, Ivy&#x27;s infatuation with Batman was one-sided; later stories presented the attraction as more mutual, but hindered by reluctance on Batman&#x27;s part. She later kisses Bruce during a robbery, poisoning him. But when she subsequently kisses a dying Batman, she unknowingly cures her intended victim and establishes a budding romantic tension between them. During the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; arc, Batman comes to her rescue while she is held captive by Clayface, with Ivy remarking that she knew he would.

In &quot;Batman: Pavane&quot; (1989), while being interviewed as a potential candidate for the Suicide Squad, Pamela reveals to Inspector Stuart on how she became Poison Ivy. When she heard about Batman, she instantly fell in love with him—believing him to be the “perfect man”; going so far as to make a love shrine of him. With her goal set, she moved to Gotham, created a costume and renamed herself “Poison Ivy”; she then began committing crimes for the purpose of getting his attention in the hopes of them becoming the #1 crime couple. Unfortunately for Pamela, it didn&#x27;t work out the way she wanted it to, and so she was apprehended and sent to Arkham Asylum.

In &quot;Batman: Hothouse&quot; (1992), Batman gains an obsession with Isley. Later, she kisses him. Now completely deranged, Ivy thinks herself &quot;Titania, Queen of the May&quot;, and Batman her Oberon—as Batman struggles with the hallucinations induced by the kiss, she pins him down and prepares to unmask him. With his last burst of strength, Batman kicks the greenhouse&#x27;s sprinklers on, washing away Ivy&#x27;s pheromones. The sobered Batman chases an increasingly desperate Ivy onto the greenhouse&#x27;s catwalks, where he barely manages to save Ivy from falling to her death. Subsequently, Ivy is returned to Arkham Asylum, her twisted love for Batman stronger than ever.

In one of the annuals of &quot;&quot;, a mutual attraction between Poison Ivy and the Batman is obvious: Ivy considers Batman &quot;the perfect man&quot;, and in a conversation with his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, he admits to finding her attractive and more appealing than Catwoman. She subsequently targets Bruce Wayne as one of those she blames for recent environmental &#x27;crimes&#x27;, giving him her poisoned kiss, but when she kisses Batman later and brags about how a second kiss is the antidote, Batman thus creates the impression that he is immune to her poisons.

In the &quot;Batman Chronicles&quot; (1995) story &quot;Passion&#x27;s Fruit&quot; (1997), Ivy is depicted as feeling lonely and deeply missing Batman while at Arkham Asylum. She hatches a scheme to unleash some of her plant creations to cause havoc in Gotham, multiplying at contact with water, until Batman finally pays her a visit at the asylum. In exchange for the visit and a kiss, she morphs her creations into harmless strawberry plants. At the end of the story she is seen to be in improved spirits.

In &quot;Batman/Poison Ivy: Cast Shadows&quot; (2004), Batman and Ivy work together to find a killer carrying out a series of Ivy-like murders at Arkham. His butler, Alfred Pennyworth, notes that Batman has been poisoned by the flowers. Batman tells Alfred he must kiss Ivy for the cure, and that if he fails Alfred must kill him. Ivy and Batman confront each other, where Batman warns Ivy that he&#x27;ll have to knock her out to kiss her to make sure that she does not kill him when he passes out after being cured. Ivy insists for him to trust her, despite Batman&#x27;s doubts. Batman at first decides to punch her, hesitates, then they embrace and kiss passionately instead. Upon being cured, he falls, but saves himself, and saves Ivy as Gotham Tower collapses when — assuming Batman dead — Ivy tries to kill herself, once more insinuating that it is more than just lust she feels for him. Ivy and Batman share a moment together speaking, watching her plant creations create light, and Batman compliments her on her talent. Batman takes Ivy back to Arkham Asylum, so that Ivy can finish her rehabilitation. Discouraged, Ivy complains to Batman about the lack of light in her cell, and Batman responds that there is nothing he can do about it, before departing. Transferred to a new cell the next morning, Ivy is stunned when she discovers that her room has been moved to a special cell where she can be in the sunlight, and has been filled with flowers as a gift. Upon being told some &quot;anonymous benefactor&quot; wanted to make sure her time is not as daunting as it might have been, a touched Ivy smiles and thanks Batman.

In &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #14 (January 2013), Ivy kisses Batman, trying to gain control over him via her toxins, and saying, “You&#x27;re the only one for me Batman, you know that right? Nobody else even comes close. Not anybody.⁣⁣⁣” Rather than using an antidote, he rigs his visor to show him certain set of visual stimuli that will effectively erase his short-term memory, thereby erasing any commands she gives him as well. Aware of his resistance, she tries to appeal to his sense of morality.

In &quot;Gothtopia&quot;, Batman comes to her rescue when he realizes she was telling him the truth, even though he put her in Arkham. First she punches him for not believing her claims, and then she kisses him for coming to her rescue, poisoning him with her mind control toxin. Resisting it, he warns that they would be best off helping each other for now. Thanks to her own resistance and the kiss he received, both Batman and Ivy become immune to Scarecrow&#x27;s gas effect.

In the 2021 Fear State Comic Series, Batman: 113 features an exploration into Batman&#x27;s mind and shows Poison Ivy kissing him, alongside both Catwoman and Talia al Ghul seemingly confirming towards a past relationship between the two characters in the current canon universe. In the thirteenth issue of the Poison Ivy Solo Series, Bruce refers to their past romantic relationship when talking to Pamela once she returns to Gotham.

The relationship even briefly deviated from the Batman/Ivy relationship into a Bruce/Pamela one when, in the comic series &quot;&quot;, he helps her return to normal.

In &quot;&quot;, Bruce and Ivy engage in a sexually implied relationship during the three month time period Bruce was under her mind control as instructed by mob boss Carmine Falcone.

===Harley Quinn===
Prior to the New 52 reboot, Ivy is shown as teamed up on occasion with fellow villain Harley Quinn with Harley being her best friend and recurring ally. They are sometimes shown as romantically involved. Unlike most villain team-ups, their partnership is based on genuine friendship and mutual respect. Ivy sincerely wants to save Harley from her unhealthy abusive relationship with the Joker. Accordingly, Poison Ivy despises the Joker, and the two exchange vicious banter at every opportunity. In the final storyline of the &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot; series, Harley suggests that Ivy may be in love with her, an accusation that stuns her. The following issue has Poison Ivy acknowledge that she may indeed love Harley, but the details of her love are never specified, and the series ended with the New 52 reboot before their relationship could be addressed.

In June 2015, Poison Ivy was revealed to be romantically involved with Harley Quinn by &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; series writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner, stating that she is in a romantic relationship with Harley &quot;without the jealousy of monogamy&quot;.

In &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; (vol. 1) #8, Harley went on a vacation with Ivy to a nudist colony in which she tried to convince Ivy to move in with her, but while Ivy admitted that she loves Harley more than any other person on Earth and would love to spend as much time with her as possible, she is currently more dedicated to saving the environment. Harley was disappointed and very sad, but accepted it and the two parted with promises to meet again.

In &quot;Injustice 2&quot; #70, which takes place in an alternate universe, Poison Ivy states that she was married to Harley Quinn.

==Teams==
Ivy teamed up on occasion with fellow villain, Harley Quinn with Harley being her close friend and recurring ally. The partnership between Harley and Ivy has also at times included Catwoman, such as in episodes and issues of the &quot;Gotham Girls&quot; webtoon and comic book series. In the mainstream DC Universe, the three formed an alliance in the pages of &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot;.

Poison Ivy was invited to join the Birds of Prey by Black Canary in The New 52 continuity reboot. Katana and Starling reject the idea and even attack Ivy, but after a brief scuffle, the women begin working together as a team. She remained with the team for a time, but eventually betrayed them, shortly before the team split-up. When the Birds were reformed under the leadership of Batgirl, Poison Ivy was not invited back.

Poison Ivy joins Two-Face&#x27;s gang for a short period of time during &quot;&quot;, when she murders crime boss Lucia Viti on Two-Face&#x27;s orders. She is notably the only member of the gang to be upset by Two-Face&#x27;s casual murder of fellow gang member Solomon Grundy, a plant-based entity. The gang is broken up after Two-Face&#x27;s apparent death at the hands of the Joker.

Poison Ivy is a member of the original Injustice Gang of the World, which fights the Justice League on several occasions.

She joins the Secret Society of Super Villains for a mission against the Justice League. She later joins Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s incarnation of the Society.

She is coerced into being a member of the Suicide Squad. During this time, she uses her abilities to enslave Count Vertigo.

==Reception==
IGN&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Poison Ivy as #64. She was ranked 21st in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;s &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list.

=====DC Animated Universe=====
Poison Ivy appears in media set in the DC Animated Universe (DCAU), voiced by Diane Pershing.
* First appearing in &quot;&quot; (1992), her metahuman characteristics are initially downplayed, with her immunity to toxins that also renders her infertile being the only ability displayed. As such, she does not directly control plants, instead breeding special plants and using her chemistry knowledge and a wrist-mounted crossbow in her crimes.
* In &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, Ivy was aesthetically revamped to look more plant-like, sporting light green skin and a dark green outfit that exposes her legs. Additionally, she is more humorous and seductive in personality, coinciding with her friendly relationship with Harley Quinn, and her fanatical plant-based mindset is greatly reduced.
* While Ivy does not appear in &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, the episode &quot;Out of the Past&quot; includes a portrayal of her in the play &quot;The Legend of Batman&quot;. When asked about Ivy&#x27;s fate, series creator Paul Dini stated that she moved to South America and settled in the Amazon rainforest, allowing her physical body to merge with and become one with the environment.
* Ivy appears in the &quot;Static Shock&quot; episode &quot;Hard As Nails&quot;.
* An alternate universe variant of Ivy makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the &quot;Justice League&quot; two-part episode &quot;A Better World&quot;. This version was lobotomized by the Justice Lords and became a gardener at Arkham Asylum. Series co-developer Bruce Timm stated that he rejected further appearances for the character in favor of focusing on new characters and storylines while bringing back a minimal number of villains from previous series.

* Poison Ivy appears in &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), portrayed by Uma Thurman. This version is a Wayne Enterprises botanist who experiments with the Venom serum and cross-breeding plants with animal DNA so they can fight back and protect themselves. Her colleague Jason Woodrue steals her work to create Bane and tries to kill her with various toxins, but inadvertently transforms her into Poison Ivy. After killing Woodrue, Ivy joins forces with Bane and Mr. Freeze to destroy Gotham, during which she attempts to kill Nora Fries. However, Batman, Robin, and Batgirl save Nora and thwart the villains, with Ivy and Freeze becoming cellmates at Arkham Asylum. Thurman&#x27;s portrayal of Poison Ivy was praised by critics and fans.
* &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; director Cathy Yan wanted to make a sequel that could have explored the relationship between Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, with the latter meant to appear in &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot;, until the film was put on hold.

<text>Glen David Brin (born October 6, 1950) is an American science fiction author. He has won the Hugo, Locus, Campbell and Nebula Awards. His novel &quot;The Postman&quot; was adapted into a 1997 feature film starring Kevin Costner.

==Early life and education==

Brin was born in Glendale, California, in 1950 to Selma and Herb Brin. He graduated from the California Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in astronomy, in 1973. At the University of California, San Diego, he earned a Master of Science in electrical engineering (optics) in 1978 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in astronomy in 1981.

==Career==
From 1983 to 1986, he was a postdoctoral research fellow at the California Space Institute, of the University of California, at the San Diego campus in La Jolla.
In 2010, Brin became a fellow of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies. He helped establish the Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination at UCSD. He serves on the advisory board of NASA&#x27;s Innovative and Advanced Concepts group and frequently does futurist consulting for corporations and government agencies.

As of 2013, he served on the Board of Advisors for the Museum of Science Fiction.

==Personal life==
Brin has Polish Jewish ancestry, from the area around Konin. His grandfather was drafted into the Russian army and fought in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. 

As of 2022, Brin was living in San Diego County, California, with his wife and children.

== Works ==
Most of Brin&#x27;s fiction is categorized as hard science fiction, in that they apply some degree of plausible scientific or technological change as important plot elements. About half of Brin&#x27;s works are in his Uplift Universe. These have twice won the Hugo Award for Best Novel.

Much of Brin&#x27;s work outside the Uplift series focuses on technology&#x27;s effects on human society.

<text>Andromeda (formally titled Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s Andromeda) is a space opera television series, based on unused material by Gene Roddenberry, developed by Robert Hewitt Wolfe, and produced by Roddenberry&#x27;s widow, Majel Barrett. The series follows Kevin Sorbo as Captain Dylan Hunt of the Systems Commonwealth, an intergalactic government that presided over an extended period of peace and prosperity until its destruction from a rebellion led by the warmongering Nietzcheans and parasitic Magog. The series premiered on October 2, 2000, and ended on May 13, 2005.

&quot;Andromeda&quot; was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and produced by Andromeda Productions, Tribune Entertainment, Fireworks Entertainment and MBR Productions. In Canada, the show aired on Global Television Network (Fireworks&#x27; parent company) and ran in first-run broadcast syndication in the United States.

&quot;Andromeda&quot; is one of two television series (alongside &quot;&quot;) produced after Roddenberry&#x27;s death based on concepts he had created as early as the 1960s and 1970s; Roddenberry died in 1991, nine years prior to the series premiere. The name Dylan Hunt had previously been used for the hero of two television pilots Roddenberry had produced in the mid-1970s – &quot;Genesis II&quot; and &quot;Planet Earth&quot; – all of which shared a similar dystopian post-apocalyptic premise.

==Premise==

Thousands of years in the future, the Systems Commonwealth is a constitutional monarchy spanning the Milky Way, Triangulum, and Andromeda galaxies, with the capital of Tarn-Vedra near Andromeda&#x27;s core. The Commonwealth is at war with the Magog, a parasitic humanoid species spreading across the galaxies. Peace talks led the Commonwealth to cede a key world to the Magog, that of the Nietzscheans; in response, the Nietzscheans secretly attempted to usurp control of the Commonwealth.

Dylan Hunt is the captain of the Commonwealth starship &quot;Andromeda Ascendant&quot;. Its computer is a powerful artificial intelligence which Dylan has nicknamed &quot;Andromeda&quot; or &quot;Rommie&quot;. Caught in a surprise attack in the first engagement of the Nietzschean uprising, the &quot;Andromeda&quot; is crippled, prompting Dylan to order the crew to evacuate. During the attack, Dylan&#x27;s Nietzschean first officer, Gaheris Rhade, betrays Dylan and attempts to kill him. Dylan kills Gaheris as &quot;Andromeda&quot; is caught at the edge of the event horizon of a black hole, freezing both in time.

303 years later, in CY 10087 (approx 5167 AD), the &quot;Andromeda&quot; is pulled from the event horizon by the crew of the salvage ship &quot;Eureka Maru,&quot; captained by con-artist and expert pilot Beka Valentine, super-genius engineer Seamus Zelazny Harper, doctor and alien of unknown origin Trance Gemini, and pacifist Magog Rev Bem (the salvage crew&#x27;s beneficiary also secretly brings Nietzschean mercenary Tyr Anasazi). The Systems Commonwealth has fallen, and the era known as &quot;The Long Night&quot; has begun. Hunt recruits the crew to join him in restoring the Systems Commonwealth and to &quot;rekindle the light of civilization&quot;.

==&quot;Andromeda&quot; universe==
===Slipstream===
Slipstream is the primary mode of travel for ships in the &quot;Andromeda&quot; universe, and the only known method of traveling faster than the speed of light. The Vedran discovery of the slipstream was instrumental in the formation of their interstellar empire, which became the precursor of the Systems Commonwealth.

Slipstream cannot be navigated by AIs (they only have a 50% chance of choosing the correct path). Only organic pilots can &quot;sense&quot; a way to their destination (they have a 99% chance of choosing the correct path), and although AIs are fitted on all large ships, they always require an organic pilot for interstellar travel. It is implied that the process of choosing a path is what makes it the correct one.

A function of slipstream is that apparent objective velocities are extremely variable, as it enables travel across millions of light years seemingly as swiftly as traveling between neighboring stars only tens of light years apart. Further, slipstream is a non-linear method of travel; the fastest or safest way to slipstream between two points, though they might be in the same galaxy, may involve slipstreaming to another galaxy entirely. The more frequently used routes are often easier, faster and more predictable. Locations relatively nearby in ordinary space may be difficult or impossible to access via slipstream.

===Systems Commonwealth===
The Systems Commonwealth was a huge utopian civilization, spanning three major galaxies of the Local Group. It was founded by the Vedrans, the first race to discover slipstream, who initially used it to conquer the Andromeda Galaxy. After a long and bitter war of attrition with the major powers of the Triangulum Galaxy, the Vedran Empire was reorganized as the democratic Systems Commonwealth. The Commonwealth served as a peaceful intergalactic government for almost 10,000 years until the Nietzschean revolt.

===Major star systems===
* Hephaestus, a system with a significant Nietzschean population, devastated by a rogue black hole in the pilot episode and the place of Dylan&#x27;s frozen imprisonment in time for 300 years. 
* Mobius, a barren world with underground cities. Mobius was ruled by ruthless dictators for many centuries but joined the New Commonwealth when its leader, the &quot;Great Compass&quot; Venetri, resigned.
* San-Ska-Re, a Than homeworld and a major power in post-Fall Known Worlds. Did not actually appear on screen.
* Seefra, a mysterious artificial system of nine planets and two suns where Dylan and his crew were transported after the Battle of Arkology. 
* Tarazed, a world with significant human and loyalist Nietzschean populations; it survived the Long Night largely unscathed. It became the first capital of the New Commonwealth. Birthplace of Telemachus Rhade. Tarazed was described in the series as being located in another galaxy and therefore is not intended to be equivalent to a non-fictional star of the same name.
* Tarn-Vedra, the capital of the Old Systems Commonwealth and Vedran homeworld. All slipstream routes to Tarn-Vedra vanished soon after the Nietzschean rebellion, contributing to the ensuing chaos. Dylan was born on Tarn-Vedra. One of his motivations for restoring the Commonwealth is the search for his own lost home.
* Earth was ravaged by the Nietzschean occupation and Magog assaults during the Long Night. Harper was born and acquired his notable survival skills there.
* Arkology, a huge space station with a pacifist population.

===Major races===
* Avatars of the Suns, humanoid forms of stars with great powers. They are immortal and can travel through time and space, affecting events and people as they wish.
* Humans make up about 70% of the Known Worlds population. Subspecies with minor genetic enhancements (like the Inari) are common.
* Kalderans, a xenophobic reptilian race that once rivaled the Vedrans. 
* Magog, a race of savage semi-intelligent alien killers, feared throughout the Known Worlds. The Magog have to kill and eat fresh meat to sustain themselves and to lay eggs in sentient beings to procreate.
* Nietzscheans, a group of superior humans who believed in self-improvement via genetic engineering and intense competition. They left Earth thousands of years ago and evolved into a separate subspecies (&quot;Homo sapiens invictus&quot;) that colonized many worlds throughout the galaxies. Nietzscheans are responsible for the Fall of the Systems Commonwealth; however, they failed to replace it with the Nietzschean Empire due to constant betrayals and conflicts between different Nietzschean Prides.
* Nightsiders, rat-like humanoids with poor vision, but highly developed hearing. Their reproductive cycle is very damaging to the environment, as their early larval stage is an aquatic creature that eats anything it comes across.
* Paradine, a highly evolved form of the Vedrans, who look like ordinary humans. The Paradine apparently had a special role in dealing with the Avatars of the Suns and the Route of Ages, but they are all but extinct now. 
* Perseids, a highly intelligent race of alien scientists and bureaucrats.
* Pyrian, a grotesque, tentacled orb like species who are one of the most powerful enemies of the Commonwealth.
* Than-Thre-Kull (Than), a tough and highly intelligent and civilized insectoid race divided into various function-specific castes.
* Vedrans, the first intelligent race to discover the slipstream that connects the entire universe. The Vedrans went on to conquer the Known Worlds, building the Vedran Empire. The Empire was plagued by internal conflicts and eventually was peacefully transformed into the Systems Commonwealth.

===Other races===
* Bokor, dangerous parasites that possess other species in order to survive, spreading through physical contact. Inside their shells, the Bokor are practically invulnerable to any type of weapon, ranging to energy, melee or bullets. However, they are vulnerable to electricity. Their existence in the Known Worlds is abhorred by the Than, who attack any vessel carrying them. For normal humanoids, it takes a while for the Bokor to destroy their neural functions and take over.
* Ogami, a race of brutish pirates and mercenaries.

===Organizations===
* Collectors, The Commonwealth&#x27;s keepers of secret history. 
* Genites, a high-tech, numerous and well-organized intergalactic group whose aim is to rid the universe of genetically engineered beings, especially the Nietzschean Prides, who brought about the downfall of humanity.
* High Guard, the main military force of the Systems Commonwealth.
* Tech Police, the brutish anti-tech enforcement on Seefra-1.
* Templar, a group of men and women who sought to restore order after the Fall. They were founded by High Guard Admiral Constanza Stark.

==Production==
Majel Barrett and Tribune Entertainment began developing series from Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s archive in 1997. Robert Hewitt Wolfe was brought in to develop the series. Fireworks Entertainment was brought in to co-finance and for international distribution. In early 1999, actor Kevin Sorbo was recruited to star in the series while he starred in &quot;&quot;. Eric Gold, and Barrett were also to be executive producers and Wolfe as co-executive producer. Bette Chadwick was in charge of casting, while visual effects were initially handled by Lost Boys Studios and Northwest Imaging &amp; FX. By September 9, 1999, Tribune had stations committed for two years in 24 of the top 30 markets with 22 Tribune and 38 Sinclair stations for a 60% national clearance giving the series a green light. The show was offered barter terms with an eight national/six local advertising split.

The &quot;Andromeda&quot; theme music used in season one was composed by Alex Lifeson, guitarist for the Canadian progressive rock band Rush.

&quot;Andromeda&quot;″s first episode was aired on syndication in the United States on October 2, 2000 while being carried on Global Television Network in Canada. Tribune Broadcasting station signed on to carry the show in its first season. On January 20, 2002, &quot;Andromeda&quot; was renewed for two seasons, its third and fourth, having gotten two year deals with stations in 39 out the top 40 markets. By January 31, 2003, the show was renewed for its fourth season, 2003–2004, in 148 markets representing 88% of the United States. The show was averaging 2.2 rating for the 2002–2003 season, third behind &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. For the 2003–2004 season, the show is one of only four first-run scripted series in syndication along with its Tribune stable mate, &quot;Mutant X&quot;.

On January 14, 2004, the Sci-Fi Channel made a deal for the show and all its episodes plus fellow Tribune syndicated but discontinued show &quot;Beastmaster&quot;. In March, the cable channel would start showing season four episodes which would then be seen in syndication seven to ten days later. With the deal, the series was renewed for its fifth and final season. The show began its run on Sci-Fi with a re-airing of the two-hour pilot episode.

On April 23, 2004, CanWest Global Communications announced the closure of Fireworks Entertainment and placing Fireworks&#x27; library up for sale. With Fireworks being the primary production company, this was effectively the show&#x27;s cancellation notice. However, two of Fireworks&#x27; shows were shifted to fellow CanWest subsidiary Global Television. Tribune had ordered the show and &quot;Mutant X&quot; into production for the 2004–2005 season under the show&#x27;s contract options. Fireworks Entertainment took Tribune to court to get an order releasing them from production and financing the two series.

===Robert Hewitt Wolfe&#x27;s departure===
During filming of season two, series developer and executive producer Robert Hewitt Wolfe announced he had been released from the show&#x27;s production and was replaced by Bob Engels. The change was purportedly to make the show more episodic and open to casual viewing since Wolfe&#x27;s version—although episodic—had many plotlines and story arcs. After the show&#x27;s final episode aired, Wolfe wrote and published a one-act play entitled &quot;Coda&quot; that explained his intended plans for the show without contradicting the aired episodes. This play is now hosted on &quot;Drive Back the Night – An Andromeda Podcast&quot;.

In discussion on his website&#x27;s forums and various interviews, Wolfe has elaborated that he was released from the production staff after he refused to shift the show&#x27;s focus more onto Kevin Sorbo&#x27;s character, Dylan Hunt, by essentially making all of the show&#x27;s episodes Hunt-centric. The events of the episode &quot;Ouroboros&quot;, the final episode written by Wolfe, introduced the last major changes that Wolfe was willing to make to the series.

==Home media==
By 2003, ADV Films had home video/DVD rights for the show in the USA. The company released the entire series on DVD in region 1 between 2003 and 2006. In December 2003, ADV released Season 3, Collection 2. On October 3, 2006, they released a complete series DVD box set known as &quot;Andromeda: The Slipstream Collection&quot;.

Alliance Home Entertainment (under license from CanWest Global Communications) has released all five seasons on DVD in Canada only.

In Region 2, Revelation Films has released the first four seasons on DVD in the United Kingdom. The fifth and final season was released on November 24, 2014.

On January 26, 2015, Revelation Films released a complete series set on DVD in the United Kingdom.

In Region 4, Beyond Home Entertainment has released all five seasons on DVD in Australia. In 2007/2008, they re-released all five seasons in new collector&#x27;s editions that featured new packaging and all episodes were digitally re-mastered in widescreen format.

A region B Blu-ray release of the first season was released on June 24, 2013, in the United Kingdom, with the next two seasons following by the end of that year.

The all-region Blu-ray release of the complete box set of all five seasons was released on September 19, 2016.

== Reception ==
The first season received mixed to negative reviews. &quot;Starburst&quot; described &quot;Andromeda&quot; as a &quot;delightfully motley cast of characters, and the scripts by Wolfe and his writing team are brimming with witty interplay.&quot; A mixed review from &quot;Variety&quot; says &quot;Andromeda&quot; &quot;could offer a few campy laughs on a weekend afternoon&quot;. In a retrospective, Digital Spy remarks &quot;this show hasn&#x27;t exactly aged that well... but if you remotely like sci-fi, we also bet you&#x27;ll find yourself sucked into this nostalgia-fest in no time&quot;.

&quot;Andromeda&quot; received negative reviews from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t expect much excitement... &#x27;Andromeda&#x27; isn&#x27;t intended to be taken too seriously, but that doesn&#x27;t excuse its penchant for dopey dialogue&quot;), &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; (&quot;After surviving a hilariously bad slow motion fight sequence.. Sorbo meets up with a band of misfit scavengers who may not be as bad as they seem, but make up for it by being twice as annoying&quot;), Common Sense Media (&quot;this series lacks the spark that made Star Trek so much fun. The politics sometimes seem overly confusing, and some of the characters are thinly developed&quot;), SciFiNow (&quot;It&#x27;s a cliche but decent enough... but the problem is that Andromeda falls into Star Trek: Voyager territory by playing it safe and not doing enough to develop its characters&quot;) and &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; (&quot;it&#x27;s kiddie-minded science-fiction with average special effects... and a set that was clearly built on a lower budget than the &#x27;Star Trek&#x27; shows.&quot;).

==Awards==
&quot;Andromeda&quot; was nominated for 39 awards at organizational events spanning the years 2001 to 2006. The nominations comprised six Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films, USA awards, five Chicago International Film Festival awards, eight Gemini Awards, fifteen Leo Awards, and five WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival awards. The show won 18 of those awards.

<doc id="74160" wikidata="Q313655" url="?curid=74160" title="Kevin Sorbo">
<text>Kevin David Sorbo (born September 24, 1958) is an American actor. He has had starring roles in two television series: as Hercules in &quot;&quot; (1995–1999) and as Captain Dylan Hunt in &quot;Andromeda&quot; (2000–2005). In between his years playing Hercules, Sorbo played his first leading film role in the 1997 fantasy film &quot;Kull the Conqueror&quot;.

Sorbo is also known for acting in Christian films, such as &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead&quot; (2014) and &quot;Let There Be Light&quot; (2017).

==Early life and education==
Sorbo was born in Mound, Minnesota, on September 24, 1958. He is of Norwegian descent. He was raised in a Lutheran family. Sorbo attended Minnesota State University Moorhead, where he double majored in marketing and advertising. To help pay for tuition, he began to work as a model for print and television advertising.

==Career==
===Early work===
In the mid-1980s, Sorbo traveled around Europe and Australia working in television commercials and also modeling for print advertisements. During this period, he made his acting debut in an episode of the soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; in 1986. His second television appearance was in an episode of the sitcom &quot;1st &amp; Ten&quot; in 1988. He continued working in advertising and by the early 1990s, he had appeared in over 150 commercials. One of the popular commercials he appeared in was for Jim Beam bourbon whiskey, known for Sorbo&#x27;s repeated catchphrase, &quot;This ain&#x27;t Jim Beam&quot;. 

His acting career continued with guest appearances in &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot; and &quot;The Commish&quot;. In 1992, he played his first leading role in an unsuccessful television pilot for a medical drama series titled &quot;Condition: Critical&quot;, which was not picked up, but aired as a television film on ABC. In 1993, he was considered for and lost out to Dean Cain as Superman in the TV series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; and was one of the possible contenders for the role of Fox Mulder in &quot;The X-Files&quot;, which went to David Duchovny. In 1993, he made his film debut in &quot;Slaughter of the Innocents&quot;.

===Professional breakthrough with &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Kull&quot;, and other film offers===
In 1993, Sorbo received his breakthrough leading role as the ancient greek demigod Hercules in a series of five television films that aired as part of Universal Television&#x27;s Action Pack. The first film to premiere was &quot;Hercules and the Amazon Women&quot;, which aired in April 1994, the others following later in the year. The ratings success of the films paved the way for the commission of the television series &quot;&quot;, which started airing in syndication from January 1995 and ran for six seasons. The series made Sorbo an international star and was one of the highest rated syndicated television shows at the time. The show was filmed in New Zealand.

The success of the show spawned the popular spin-off series &quot;&quot; starring Lucy Lawless, who was introduced in a three-episode arc in the first season of &quot;Hercules&quot;. This allowed several characters from both shows to make crossover appearances. In 1998, a spin-off direct-to-video, animated film titled &quot;Hercules and Xena – The Animated Movie: The Battle for Mount Olympus&quot; was released with both Sorbo and Lawless voicing the characters.

&quot;Hercules&quot; was canceled midway through the filming of Season Six, of which only eight episodes were produced. The final episode aired in November 1999. Although it was not revealed at the time, health issues reduced Sorbo&#x27;s abilities to perform the physically demanding role during the later seasons. Sorbo made his final appearance as Hercules on &quot;Xena&quot;, in the Season Five episode &quot;God Fearing Child&quot;, which aired in February 2000.

In between his years playing Hercules, Sorbo played his first leading film role in the 1997-released film &quot;Kull the Conqueror&quot;. The actor was selected for the role in December 1995, and the picture was shot in Slovakia and Croatia between August and October 1996. In a mostly negative review, &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes, &quot;Mr. Sorbo provides the requisite oiled torso, a hint of humor and the professionalism and good grace to act as if &quot;Kull the Conqueror&quot; mattered.&quot;

In July 1997, it was announced that Sorbo would star in &quot;Black Dog&quot; for around $3 million, with Kevin Hooks slated to direct and produce and the intention to shoot in September during Sorbo&#x27;s hiatus from &quot;Hercules: The Legendary Journeys&quot;. During an interview, Sorbo described the film as &quot;&quot;Die Hard&quot; meets &quot;Speed&quot;.&quot; In September 1997, Meat Loaf and Randy Travis were signed to star opposite Sorbo. However, by November of that year, it was reported that Patrick Swayze had replaced Sorbo in &quot;Black Dog&quot;.

===Post-&quot;Hercules&quot; work===
After &quot;Hercules&quot; ended, Sorbo played the starring role of Captain Dylan Hunt in the science-fiction drama series &quot;Andromeda&quot; from 2000 to 2005. In 2006, he played a recurring role on the final season of &quot;The O.C.&quot;

In 2007, he starred in two direct-to-video sequels to &quot;Walking Tall&quot;, &quot;Walking Tall: The Payback&quot; and &quot;Walking Tall: Lone Justice&quot;. In the Hallmark Channel film &quot;Avenging Angel&quot;, he co-starred with his real wife, Sam Jenkins.

In 2008, he appeared in the spoof film titled&quot; Meet the Spartans&quot;, which was a box office success despite poor reviews.

In the first of what would be several voice acting jobs, Sorbo performed one of the main protagonists, Prometheus, in the video game &quot;The Conduit&quot;. He also reprised the role of Hercules in the video game &quot;God of War III&quot; and worked together with his wife on the game &quot;Cloudberry Kingdom&quot;.

In 2014, Sorbo co-starred in &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead&quot;, a Christian film in which he portrayed an atheist college professor who requires his students to disown their religions on the first day of his class.
Although heavily panned by critics, it was a commercial success and the first of a sequence of Christian films that Sorbo would produce or perform.
Sorbo appeared in the 2015 romantic comedy &quot;Single in South Beach&quot;, starring Haley Webb. On Twitter, in 2019, she accused Sorbo of sexual advances and of sexually harassing her on the set. However, Webb did not elaborate on any of her accusations, and he did not respond to her tweet.

In 2017, Sorbo directed and starred in the Christian drama film &quot;Let There Be Light&quot;, which featured conservative pundit Sean Hannity, who was also an executive producer. It was described by the &quot;New Yorker&quot; as &quot;a cynical, xenophobic morality tale, as bitter as it is saccharine&quot; that closes with &quot;a dénouement of bald Islamophobia&quot;. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, although critical, says that it provides &quot;an involving bonanza&quot; for its intended Christian audience. Sorbo is described as bringing &quot;puckish charm and credible warmth to his role&quot;.

In 2024, he appeared in the Ronald Reagan biopic opposite Dennis Quaid, who plays the title role.

==Personal life==
Sorbo is a Christian. Although he grew up Lutheran, he attends a nondenominational church. On January 5, 1998, Sorbo married actress Sam Jenkins, whom he met the previous year when she had a small recurring role on &quot;Hercules&quot; (Season 3, Episode 8 &quot;Prince Hercules&quot;). They have three children, including Braeden Sorbo. Sorbo is the spokesman and chair of A World Fit for Kids! (AWFFK!), a non-profit organization that trains teenagers to become mentors to younger children.

In 2001, Sorbo was featured on a celebrity edition of the game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, winning $32,000. The money was donated to his charity, A World Fit For Kids.

===Health===
In late 1997, while on a publicity tour for &quot;Kull the Conqueror&quot; and between the fourth and fifth seasons of &quot;Hercules&quot;, the newly engaged Sorbo experienced an aneurysm in his shoulder which caused three strokes. As a result, he was weakened for the next several years, a condition kept secret from the public while he recovered. During the last two seasons of &quot;Hercules&quot; (the fifth and sixth, which aired in 1998 and 1999), Sorbo had a reduced filming schedule to accommodate his condition, and more guest stars were featured in the show in order to reduce Sorbo&#x27;s duties. In his 2011 autobiography &quot;True Strength&quot;, Sorbo revealed the details of his injury and how his wife Sam helped him recover.

In 2013, Sorbo received the Public Leadership in Neurology Award from the American Academy of Neurology and the American Brain Foundation for his efforts raising awareness about stroke. He also received the 2013 Inspiration Honors Award from the Invisible Disabilities Association.

===Politics===

In 2014, during an interview with Jerry Newcombe on the radio show &quot;Vocal Point&quot;, Sorbo defended Mel Gibson against allegations that his 2004 film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; was anti-Semitic with the words: &quot;News bulletin: you did kill Jesus!&quot; Sorbo later stated he could have rephrased his statements, but defended his stance.

Facebook removed him from the platform during the COVID-19 pandemic claiming &quot;We removed Kevin Sorbo&#x27;s page for repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines.&quot; Sorbo responded that he posts things that doctors say and that Facebook had been shadow banning him for a year prior. He stated: &quot;I [would have been] more than happy to take them [down], whatever offensive posts that Facebook deemed that I should not be posting, So, I question their statements… that they gave me.&quot;

After Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, Sorbo repeatedly made remarks defending Trump&#x27;s claims of election fraud. Although he initially supported the protestors as loyal defenders of Trump and enjoined them to respect the police, Sorbo subsequently backtracked and blamed the violence on antifa. This led to a widely reported Twitter exchange between him and his former co-star Lucy Lawless, who have exchanged conflicting views on personal and political matters throughout the past 20 years.

In 2022, Sorbo was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He wore a suit lined with his own tweets. In 2023, Sorbo published a children&#x27;s book entitled &quot;The Test of Lionhood&quot;, which explores the theme of masculinity from a Christian perspective for young boys, as part of a larger fight in defense of the virtues of masculinity, which he says are being eroded in Hollywood and in society at large.

<doc id="74167" wikidata="Q396184" url="?curid=74167" title="Poutine">
<text>Poutine () is a dish of french fries and cheese curds topped with a brown gravy. It emerged in Quebec in the late 1950s in the Centre-du-Québec region, though its exact origins are uncertain, and there are several competing claims regarding its invention. For many years, it was used by some to mock Quebec society. Poutine later became celebrated as a symbol of Québécois culture and the province of Quebec. It has long been associated with Quebec cuisine, and its rise in prominence has led to its growing popularity throughout the rest of Canada.

Annual poutine celebrations occur in Montreal, Quebec City, and Drummondville, as well as Toronto, Ottawa, New Hampshire, and Chicago. It has been called Canada&#x27;s national dish, though some critics believe this labelling represents cultural appropriation of the Québécois or Quebec&#x27;s national identity. Many variations on the original recipe are popular, leading some to suggest that poutine has emerged as a new dish classification in its own right, as with sandwiches or dumplings.

==History==
===Origins===
The dish was created in the Centre-du-Québec area in the late 1950s. Several restaurants in the area claim to be the originators of the dish, but no consensus exists.

*Le Lutin qui rit, Warwick – Fernand Lachance of Le Café Idéal (later Le Lutin qui rit), is said to have exclaimed in 1957, &quot;&quot; () when asked by a regular to put a handful of cheese curds in a take-out bag of french fries. The dish &quot;poutine&quot; appears on the establishment&#x27;s 1957 menu. Lachance served this on a plate, and beginning in 1962 added hot gravy to keep it warm.
* Le Roy Jucep, Drummondville – This drive-in restaurant served french fries with gravy, to which some customers would add a side order of cheese curds. Owner Jean-Paul Roy began serving the combination in 1958 and added it to the menu in 1964 as &quot;&quot;. Felt to be too long a name, this was later changed to &quot;poutine&quot; for a cook nicknamed &quot;Ti-Pout&quot; and a slang word for &quot;pudding&quot;. The restaurant displays a copyright registration certificate, issued by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office, which alludes to Roy having invented poutine.
* La Petite Vache, Princeville – Customers would mix cheese curds with their fries, a combination which was added to the menu. One option included gravy and was called the &quot;Mixte&quot;.

According to Canadian food researcher Sylvain Charlebois, while Warwick is the birthplace of poutine, Drummondville&#x27;s Jean-Paul Roy is the true inventor since le Roy Jucep was the first to sell poutine with three combined ingredients, in 1964. &quot;The Oxford Companion to Cheese&quot; takes a different perspective, stating that the inventors were not chefs but the customers who chose to add cheese curds to their fries.

===Development===
Poutine was consumed in small &quot;greasy spoon&quot; diners (commonly known in Quebec as or ), pubs, at roadside chip wagons (commonly known as , literally &quot;potato shacks&quot;), and in ice hockey arenas. For decades, it remained a country snack food in Quebec&#x27;s dairy region, due to the narrow freshness window of cheddar cheese curds. In 1969, poutine was brought to Quebec City in Ashton Leblond&#x27;s food truck (a business which grew into the Chez Ashton fast-food chain). In the early 1970s, La Banquise began serving poutine in Montreal, followed by the Burger King chain in 1983. Others that followed used inferior cheese and the dish&#x27;s reputation declined. Poutine was largely perceived as an unsophisticated backwoods creation or unhealthy junk food to be consumed after a night of drinking.

Montreal chefs would make poutine to feed their staff but had not dared to put it on their menus. In the 1990s, attempts were made to elevate the dish by using baked potatoes and duck stock. In November 2001, Martin Picard of bistro Au Pied de Cochon began serving a foie gras poutine which was praised by customers and food critics. This influenced chefs in Toronto and Vancouver to feature poutine on upscale menus. Chef Mark McEwan served lobster poutine at his Bymark eatery, and chef Jamie Kennedy served braised beef poutine at his eponymous restaurant. Over the next decade, poutine gained acceptance and popularity in all types of restaurants, from haute cuisine to fast food, and spread across Canada and internationally. Poutine became extremely trendy in the early 2010s, with an explosion of poutineries in cities like Toronto, leading to stories about poutine&#x27;s association with romance and events like the IBM Watson Cognitive Cooking Poutine Event, where the computer generated unique poutine recipes based on the demographics of Toronto and Montreal.

===Etymology===
The &quot;Dictionnaire historique du français québécois&quot; lists 15 meanings of in Québécois and Acadian French, most of which are for kinds of food; the word &quot;poutine&quot; in the meaning &quot;fries with cheese and gravy&quot; is dated to 1982 in English. Other senses of the word have been in use since at least 1810.

According to Merriam-Webster, a popular etymology is that &quot;poutine&quot; is from a Québécois slang word meaning &quot;mess&quot;, and that others attribute it to the English word &quot;pudding&quot;. The exact provenance of the word &quot;poutine&quot; is uncertain.

The &quot;Dictionnaire historique&quot; mentions the possibility that the form &quot;poutine&quot; is simply a gallicization of the word &quot;pudding&quot;. However, it considers it more likely that it was inherited from regional languages spoken in France, and that some of its meanings resulted from the later influence of the similar-sounding English word &quot;pudding&quot;. It cites the Provençal forms &quot;bad stew&quot; and &quot;hodgepodge&quot; or &quot;crushed fruit or foods&quot;; &quot;mixture of various things&quot; in Languedocien; and or &quot;bad stew&quot; in Franche-Comté as possibly related to &quot;poutine&quot;. The meaning &quot;fries with cheese and gravy&quot; of &quot;poutine&quot; is among those held as probably unrelated to &quot;pudding&quot;, provided the latter view is correct.

==Recipe==

The traditional recipe for poutine consists of:
* French fries: These are usually of medium thickness and fried (sometimes twice) such that the inside stays soft, while the outside is crispy.
* Cheese curds: Fresh cheese curds are used to give the desired texture. The curd size varies, as does the amount used.
*Brown gravy: Traditionally, it is a light and thin beef or chicken gravy, somewhat salty and mildly spiced with a hint of pepper; or a &quot;sauce brune&quot;, which is a combination of chicken and beef stock. Poutine sauces () are sold in Quebec, Ontario, and Maritime grocery stores in jars or cans and in powdered mix packets; some grocery chains offer their own house-brand versions. Many stores and restaurants also offer vegetarian gravy.

To maintain the texture of the fries, the cheese curds and gravy are added immediately before serving the dish. The hot gravy is usually poured over room-temperature cheese curds, so they are warmed without melting completely. The thin gravy allows all the fries to be coated. The serving dish typically has some depth to act as a basket for the fries so that they retain their heat. It is important to control the temperature, timing, and the order in which the ingredients are added to obtain the right food textures—an essential part of the experience of eating poutine.

Freshness and juiciness of the curds is essential. Air and moisture seep out of the curds over time, altering their acidity level. This causes proteins to lose their elasticity, and the curds to lose their complex texture and characteristic squeaky sound when chewed. The curds should be less than a day old, which requires proximity to a dairy. While Montreal is from a cheese plant in Mirabel, restaurants and specialty cheese shops outside of dairy regions may be unable to sell enough curds to justify the expense of daily deliveries. Furthermore, Canadian food safety practices require curds to be refrigerated within 24 hours, which suppresses the properties of their texture. This has resulted in &quot;poutineries&quot; which specialize in the dish; busy poutineries may use of curds per day. Poutineries which are too distant from dairies may make their own cheese curds on site, in batches every few hours, to ensure a fresh and steady supply.

===Variations===


The texture, temperature and viscosity of poutine&#x27;s ingredients differ and continuously change as the food is consumed, making it a dish of highly dynamic contrasts. Strengthening these contrasts, superior poutines are identified by the crispiness of the fries, freshness of the curds, and a unifying gravy. Even small variations in ingredients or preparation—the oil used for frying, the origin of the curds, or spices in the gravy—can result in a distinctly different experience of eating the poutine.

Some recipes eliminate the cheese, but most Québécois would call such a dish a (), not poutine. When curds are unavailable, mozzarella cheese may be an acceptable alternative. Shredded mozzarella is commonly used in Saskatchewan. Sweet potato may be used as a healthier alternative to french fries, adding more dietary fibre and vitamins.

Poutineries, like Montreal&#x27;s La Banquise, which is credited for much of the innovation and popularization of poutine, have dozens of varieties of poutine on their menus. Many of these are based on the traditional recipe with an added meat topping such as sausage, chicken, bacon, brisket, or Montreal-style smoked meat, with the gravy adjusted for balance. The Quebec City-based chain Chez Ashton is known for its poutine Galvaude (topped with chicken and green peas) and Dulton (with ground beef). New variations are frequently introduced. Pulled pork was popular around 2013, followed a couple years later by Asian-fusion poutines.

Montreal&#x27;s high immigrant population has led to many takes on the dish inspired by other cuisines, such as Haitian, Mexican, Portuguese, Indian, Japanese, Greek, Italian and Lebanese. These poutines may bear little resemblance to the traditional recipe. They replace some or all of the ingredients but maintain the dynamic contrasts of textures and temperatures with a crispy element, a dairy or dairy-like element, and a unifying sauce. Many variations on the original recipe are popular, leading some to suggest that poutine has emerged as a new dish classification in its own right, as with sandwiches, dumplings, soups, and flatbreads.

Poutineries will frequently offer limited-time promotional specials, such as a Thanksgiving poutine with turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. In anticipation of the legalization of cannabis in Canada, Montreal&#x27;s Le Gras Dur served a &quot;pot poutine&quot; with a gravy that included hemp protein, hemp seeds and hemp oil, offered with a joint-like roll of turkey, wild mushrooms and arugula.

Gourmet poutine with three-pepper sauce, merguez sausage, foie gras or caviar and truffle can be found. This is a trend that began in the 1990s and is credited to David McMillan of Montreal&#x27;s Joe Beef and Globe restaurants. Savoury sauces like Moroccan harissa, lobster sauce, and red-wine veal &quot;jus&quot; have been used to complement artisanal cheeses and rich ingredients.

Chains such as Smoke&#x27;s Poutinerie, New York Fries, McDonald&#x27;s, Wendy&#x27;s, A&amp;W, KFC, Burger King, Harvey&#x27;s, Mary Brown&#x27;s, Arby&#x27;s, and Wahlburgers restaurants also sell versions of poutine in Quebec and the rest of Canada (although not always country-wide). Tim Hortons began selling poutine in 2018. Fast-food combination meals in Canada often have the options to have french fries &quot;poutinized&quot; by adding cheese curds and gravy, or substituting a poutine for a fries side.

===Internationally===
Poutine is found in the northern border regions of the United States, including New England and the larger Northeast, the Pacific Northwest, and the Upper Midwest. These regions offer further variations of the basic dish, usually by utilizing cheeses other than fresh curds, which are not widely available in the US. Wendy&#x27;s fast food chain offers poutine in the form of &quot;Baconator Fries&quot;, which is fried thin sticks of potato with melted yellow cheese and bits of bacon. In the country culture, a mixed fry can also come with cooked ground beef on top and is referred to as a hamburger mix, though this is less popular than a regular mix. In the Pacific Northwest, one variation replaces the gravy with chowder featuring local seafood.

Disco fries, french fries typically covered in mozzarella cheese and brown gravy, were popularized in New Jersey in the 1990s. They gained their name in the 1970s for being a favourite of late-night diners, who often came from dancing at disco clubs. The dish is also popular in New Orleans including variations called Cajun poutine.

Poutine spread to the United Kingdom, Korea and Russia, where it has been referred to as &quot;Raspoutine&quot;. The first poutinerie in Paris, La Maison de la Poutine, opened in 2017 and quickly gained attention from mainstream media and gastronomers.

A similar dish known as chips, cheese and gravy, consisting of thick-cut chips covered in shredded Manx Cheddar cheese and topped with a thick beef gravy, is popular in the Isle of Man.

==Cultural aspects==
A cultural marker, poutine had long been Quebec&#x27;s adored junk food before spreading across the rest of Canada and the United States. It had by then made inroads with food critics and established culinary circles, challenging its junk food status. Food critic Jacob Richler noted in 2012 that Canadian dishes are too similar to their European roots to be considered original, with the exception of poutine, which he credited as the country&#x27;s most famous culinary creation. In May 2014, the word &quot;poutine&quot; was added to the &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; of the English language.

In 2007, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation declared the results of an online survey on the greatest Canadian inventions, in which poutine ranked at  10. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; 2017 survey of &quot;favourite iconic Canadian food&quot; placed poutine first with 21% of respondents, ahead of maple syrup with 14%. By 2011, media outlets were reporting 11 April as National Poutine Day.
In March 2016, poutine was served at the White House during the first state dinner hosted by President Barack Obama and Canada&#x27;s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Poutine has been a highlight of Canada Day celebrations in Trafalgar Square in London, England, for several years, and was a comfort food for the local community after the 2013 Lac-Megantic derailment. It was served at the inaugural Canadian Comedy Awards.

The first poutine festival was held in Warwick, Quebec, in 1993. This annual event expanded to become the largest cheese festival in Canada. In 2014, it was moved to the larger town of Victoriaville. Montreal has hosted La Poutine Week, an annual festival, food tour, and competition held 1–7 February, since 2013. It spread across Canada and internationally, and by 2021 had become the largest poutine festival in the world, with over 700 restaurants serving more than 350,000 poutines. Le Grand Poutinefest is a poutine festival founded in 2015 which tours cities and towns in Quebec, operating most weekends from April to September. Poutine festivals are also held in Drummondville (since 2008), Ottawa-Gatineau, Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, Quebec City and Sherbrooke. In the US, major festivals have been held in Chicago, Illinois, Manchester, New Hampshire, Knoxville, Tennessee, and in Rhode Island.
Since 2010, the International Federation of Competitive Eating (IFCE) has held a world poutine-eating championship sponsored by Toronto-based chain Smoke&#x27;s Poutinerie. There was criticism that the inaugural contest was held outside of Quebec and excluded Québécois. The IFCE stated that Montreal poutineries had not expressed any interest in holding the competition. Regulations for contests in Quebec make it difficult to include the province, which is often absent from national contests. Smoke&#x27;s has since sponsored a cross-Canada poutine eating tour. In 2011, chef Chuck Hughes won on &quot;Iron Chef America&quot; (episode 2 of season 9) by beating Bobby Flay with a plate of lobster poutine.

Jones Soda Co., an originally Canadian company now based in the US, created a poutine-flavoured limited-edition soft drink in 2013, which received international pop culture attention. Bacon-poutine was one of four flavours selected as a finalist in the 2014 Lay&#x27;s Canada Do Us A Flavour potato chip contest. Though it did not win, Lay&#x27;s later added a bacon-poutine variety in its Canada entry for the World Flavourites. Loblaws&#x27; President&#x27;s Choice and Ruffles brands also offer poutine-flavoured potato chips in Canada.
Giapos Ice Cream of New Zealand has served a &quot;poutine ice cream&quot; of oolong matcha tea, ice cream and caramel sauce over hand-cut fries since 2017. 
In a 2018 promotional campaign for the film &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot;, &quot;the world&#x27;s richest poutine&quot; was created with wagyu steak, lobster, truffles, shiitake and chanterelle mushrooms, edible orchids, and gold flakes, priced just under $450.

Joel Edmundson, of the 2018–19 National Hockey League champion team St. Louis Blues, ate poutine from the Stanley Cup during celebrations attended by over 4,000 fans in his hometown of Brandon, Manitoba. Mathieu Joseph, a Chambly, Quebec, native who won the Cup with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2020 and 2021, also ate poutine from the Cup during a celebration with the Cup in 2021.

==Nutrition==

Health advocates have been critical of poutine since the 1980s. In a 2013 study of Canadian restaurants, poutine was found to have the second-highest sodium (1547 mg average and as high as 2227 mg) among single meal items, after stir-fry entrées.

==Social mobility and appropriation==
The social status of poutine has evolved dramatically since its origins in rural Quebec in the 1950s. The dish was long mocked as a culinary invention and used as a means of stigmatization by non-Québécois against Quebec society to reduce its legitimacy. While the first generations that suffered from the poutine stigma opted to disidentify from the dish, younger people in Quebec began to reappropriate poutine as a symbol of Quebecois cultural pride. Today, the dish is celebrated in many annual poutine festivals in Quebec, the rest of Canada, and in the United States.

The evolution of the different symbols associated with poutine was first studied in &quot;Maudite Poutine!&quot; by Charles-Alexandre Théorêt. Théorêt revisited many of these stigmas in an interview given at &quot;Tout le monde en parle&quot; on 11 November 2007.

As poutine gained popularity beyond the provincial borders of Quebec in the mid-2000s, the dish gradually stopped being mocked and was eventually introduced into the popular discourse as a symbol of Canadian identity. Today, the dish is often presented as being a part of Canadian cuisine, even as Canada&#x27;s national dish. Nicolas Fabien-Ouellet suggested in the peer-reviewed journal &quot;CuiZine&quot; that this &quot;Canadization&quot; of poutine constitutes cultural appropriation. This appropriation is not linked to its preparation or consumption outside Quebec, but strictly to its presentation as a Canadian dish instead of a Québécois dish. Fabien-Ouellet explains:

==In politics==
In a &quot;Talking to Americans&quot; segment on the Canadian mock television news show &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, during the 2000 US election, comedian Rick Mercer posed as a reporter and asked US politicians what they thought of &quot;Prime Minister Jean Poutine&quot; and his endorsement of George W. Bush for president. (The Prime Minister of Canada at the time was Jean Chrétien.) None of the interviewees noticed the insertion of &quot;Poutine&quot; and Bush pledged to &quot;work closely&quot; with Mr. Poutine. A few years later, when Bush made his first official visit to Canada as president, he joked in a speech, &quot;There&#x27;s a prominent citizen who endorsed me in the 2000 election, and I wanted a chance to finally thank him [...] I was hoping to meet Jean Poutine.&quot; The remark was met with laughter and applause.
In French, Russian president Vladimir Putin&#x27;s surname is spelled &quot;Poutine&quot;, with the two having identical pronunciation. The similarity has been a source of confusion; in commenting on the &quot;Talking to Americans&quot; prank on Bush, &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Al Kamen mistakenly believed that Mercer&#x27;s fictional Jean Poutine was a reference to Putin. In 2017, Russian-themed poutinerie Vladimir Poutine opened in Montreal, with dishes named for political figures from Rasputin to Donald Trump. In the week following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, frequent insults and threats were received by the three Maison de la Poutine restaurants in Paris, some stating a belief that they worked for the Russian state. Another poutinerie in Lyon changed the name of its 20-year signature dish, Vladimir poutine, stating that it &quot;was no longer funny&quot;. In Quebec, Le Roy Jucep announced that it was retiring the word &quot;poutine&quot; in support of Ukraine and reverted to &quot;&quot; on its menus and branding.

During the 2011 Canadian federal election, some voters reported receiving robocalls claiming to be from Elections Canada, from a phone number registered to &quot;Pierre Poutine&quot;. The calls targeted voters who had previously indicated they would not vote for the Conservative Party. The calls, made on election day or the day before, falsely advised voters that their polling station had been changed, in an attempt to prevent them from voting. The allegations became known as the Robocall scandal, and subsequent investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police resulted in Michael Sona, a junior Conservative Party staffer, being convicted of violating the &quot;Elections Act&quot;.

Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel had a Canadian lunch with counterpart Justin Trudeau on 16 June 2017, during which they ate hotdogs and poutine. Michel tweeted later that this was &quot;A great way to meet a dear friend though our fries are better&quot;, referring to the popular claim that fries were originally invented in Belgium. In 2019, Canada attempted to garner support for its campaign for a non-permanent United Nations Security Council seat in the following year&#x27;s election by serving poutine to UN diplomats.

<text>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow () or common yarrow, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. Growing to tall, it is characterized by small whitish flowers, a tall stem of fernlike leaves, and a pungent odor.

The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Asia, Europe, and North America. It has been introduced as a feed for livestock in New Zealand and Australia. Used by some animals, the plant may have somewhat toxic properties, although historically it has been employed for medicinal purposes.

==Description==

&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; is an erect, herbaceous, perennial plant that produces one to several stems in height, and has a spreading rhizomatous growth form. Cauline and more or less clasping, the leaves appear spirally and evenly along the stem, with the largest and most petiolate towards the base; they are long and fernlike, divided bipinnately or tripinnately.

The inflorescence has 4 to 9 phyllaries and contains ray and disk flowers which are white to pink, blooming from March to October. There are generally 3 to 8 ray flowers, which are long and ovate to round. The tiny disk flowers range from 10 to 40. The inflorescence is produced in a flat-topped capitulum cluster and the inflorescences are visited by many insects, featuring a generalized pollination system. The small achene-like fruits are called cypsela.

The plant has a sweet scent similar to that of chrysanthemums, so powerful that it may be irritating to some.

=== Chemistry ===
The dark blue essential oil of yarrow contains chemicals called proazulenes.

Chamazulene and δ-Cadinol are chemical compounds found in &quot;A. millefolium&quot;. The chromophore of azulene was discovered in yarrow and wormwood and named in 1863 by Septimus Piesse.

Yarrow contains isovaleric acid, salicylic acid, asparagine, sterols, and flavonoids. It also contains phenolic acids such as gallic acid, 3, 4-dihydroxy benzoic acid, chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, sinapic acid, ferulic acid, cinnamic acid and flavonoid such as myricetin, hesperidin, quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, apigenin, rutin, hyperoside.

==Taxonomy==

=== Subdivision ===
The several varieties and subspecies include:
*&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; subsp. &quot;millefolium&quot;
**&quot;A. m.&quot; subsp. &quot;m.&quot; var. &quot;millefolium&quot; – Europe, Asia
**&quot;A. m.&quot; subsp. &quot;m.&quot; var. &quot;borealis&quot; – Arctic regions
**&quot;A. m.&quot; subsp. &quot;m.&quot; var. &quot;rubra&quot; – Southern Appalachians
*&quot;A. millefolium&quot; subsp. &quot;chitralensis&quot; – western Himalaya
*&quot;A. millefolium&quot; subsp. &quot;sudetica&quot; – Alps, Carpathians
*&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; var. &quot;alpicola&quot; – Western United States, Alaska
*&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; var. &quot;californica&quot; – California, Pacific Northwest
*&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; var. &quot;occidentalis&quot; – North America
*&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; var. &quot;pacifica&quot; – west coast of North America, Alaska
*&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; var. &quot;puberula&quot; – endemic to California

=== Etymology ===
The genus name &quot;Achillea&quot; is derived from mythical Greek character Achilles, who reportedly carried it with his army to treat battle wounds. The specific epithet &quot;millefolium&quot; comes from the featherlike leaves which are minutely divided.

==Distribution and habitat==
Yarrow is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Asia, Europe, and North America.

The plant grows from sea level to in elevation. Common yarrow is frequently found in the mildly disturbed soil of grasslands and open forests. Active growth occurs in the spring.

In North America, both native and introduced genotypes, and both diploid and polyploid plants are found. It is found in every habitat throughout California except the Colorado and Mojave Deserts. Common yarrow produces an average yield of , with a total dry weight of .

It has been introduced as a feed for livestock in New Zealand and Australia, where it is a common weed of both wet and dry areas, such as roadsides, meadows, fields and coastal places.

== Ecology ==
=== Birds ===
Several cavity-nesting birds, including the common starling, use yarrow to line their nests. Experiments conducted on the tree swallow, which does not use yarrow, suggest that adding yarrow to nests inhibits the growth of parasites.

=== Insects ===
&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; is a food source for many species of insects, although is not particularly attractive to ladybirds.

== Cultivation ==

&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental plant by many plant nurseries. It is planted in gardens and natural landscaping settings of diverse climates and styles. They include native plant, drought-tolerant, and wildlife gardens. The plant is a frequent component of butterfly gardens. The plant prefers well-drained soil in full sun, but can be grown in less ideal conditions.

=== Propagation ===
For propagation, seeds require light for germination, so optimal germination occurs when planted no deeper than . Seeds also require a germination temperature of . It has a relatively short life in some situations, but may be prolonged by division in the spring every other year, and planting apart. It can become invasive.

=== Cultivars ===

The species use in traditional gardens has generally been superseded by cultivars with specific &#x27;improved&#x27; qualities. Some are used as drought-tolerant lawns, with periodic mowing. The many different ornamental cultivars include: &#x27;Paprika&#x27;, &#x27;Cerise Queen&#x27;, &#x27;Red Beauty&#x27;, &#x27;Red Velvet&#x27;, &#x27;Saucy Seduction&#x27;, &#x27;Strawberry Seduction&#x27; (red), &#x27;Island Pink&#x27; (pink), &#x27;Calistoga&#x27; (white), and &#x27;Sonoma Coast&#x27; (white). The following are recipients of the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
* &#x27;Credo&#x27; 
* &#x27;Lachsschönheit&#x27; (Galaxy Series) 
* &#x27;Martina&#x27; 
*&#x27;Lansdorferglut&#x27; 
The many hybrids of this species designated &quot;Achillea&quot; × &quot;taygetea&quot; are useful garden subjects, including: &#x27;Appleblossom&#x27;, &#x27;Fanal&#x27;, &#x27;Hoffnung&#x27;, and &#x27;Moonshine&#x27;.

== Toxicity ==
Yarrow can cause allergic skin rashes. It reportedly can induce menstruation and cause miscarriages.

According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, yarrow is toxic to dogs, cats, and horses, causing increased urination, vomiting, diarrhea and dermatitis.
When consumed by cows, an unfavorable flavor is given to their milk. In a standard rodent model for reproductive toxicity, aqueous extracts of yarrow produced a significant increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm.

== Uses ==

=== Traditional medicine ===
&quot;A. millefolium&quot; was used in traditional medicine, in part due to its astringent properties and the mild laxative effect of its leaves. It has been used since ancient times to heal wounds and stop bleeding, and in the sixteenth century the crushed leaves were used to stop nosebleeds. Yarrow and its North American varieties were traditionally used by many Native American nations. The Navajo historically considered it a &quot;life medicine&quot; and chewed the plant for toothaches and used its infusions for earaches. The Miwok in California used the plant as an analgesic and head cold remedy. Native American nations used the plant for healing cuts and abrasions, relief from earaches and throat infections, as well as for an eyewash. Common yarrow was used by Plains indigenous peoples to reduce pain or fever and aid sleep.

In the early 20th century, some Ojibwe people used a decoction of yarrow leaves on hot stones and inhaled it to treat headaches, or applied decoctions of the root onto skin for its stimulating effect.

=== Food ===
The entire plant is reportedly edible and nutritious, but it is advised not to consume much. The foliage is pungent; both its leaves and flowers are bitter and astringent. The leaves can be eaten young; raw, they can be added to salad. The leaves, with an aniseed-grass flavour, can be brewed as tea.

In the Middle Ages, yarrow was part of a herbal mixture known as gruit used in the flavoring of beer prior to the use of hops. The flowers and leaves are used in making some liquors and bitters.

=== Other uses ===
Yarrow is used as a companion plant, attracting some beneficial insects and repelling some pests.

&quot;A. millefolium&quot; can be planted to combat soil erosion due to the plant&#x27;s resistance to drought. Before the arrival of monocultures of ryegrass, both grass and pasture contained &quot;A. millefolium&quot; at a density of about 0.3 kg/ha. One factor for its use in grass mixtures was its deep roots, with leaves rich in minerals, minimizing mineral deficiencies in ruminant feed. It was introduced into New Zealand as a drought-tolerant pasture.

Some pick-up sticks are made of yarrow.

Yarrow can be used for dying wool as it contains apigenin and luteolin. Depending on the mordant the color may be green to yellow.

== Culture ==
Yarrow has been found with Neanderthal burials, suggesting its association with human species dates to at least 60,000 years ago.

=== China ===
Yarrow and tortoiseshell are considered to be lucky in Chinese tradition.

The stalks are dried and used as a randomising agent in I Ching divination.

=== Western world ===
In antiquity, the plant was known as &quot;herba militaris&quot; for its use in stanching the flow of blood from wounds. In the Classical Greek epic &quot;Iliad&quot;, Homer tells of the centaur Chiron, who conveyed herbal secrets to his human pupils and taught Achilles to use yarrow on the battlegrounds of Troy. The genus name &quot;Achillea&quot; is inspired by the alleged use of the herb by Achilles to treat his soldiers&#x27; wounds. Other names implying the plant&#x27;s historical use in healing—particularly in the military—include &quot;bloodwort&quot;, &quot;knight&#x27;s milfoil&quot;, &quot;staunchweed&quot;, and, from its use in the United States Civil War, &quot;soldier&#x27;s woundwort&quot;. Its use in either starting or stopping nosebleeds led to the common name &quot;nosebleed&quot;.

The English name &quot;yarrow&quot; comes from its Saxon (Old English) name &quot;gearwe&quot;, which is related to both the Dutch word &quot;gerw&quot; (alternately &quot;yerw&quot;) and the Old High German word &quot;garawa&quot;. In the eastern counties it may be called yarroway. It was called &quot;old man&#x27;s pepper&quot; due to its pungent flavor, while the name &quot;field hop&quot; came from its use in beer making in Sweden.

In the Hebrides, a leaf held against the eyes was sometimes believed to give second sight. In the witchcraft trial of Elspeth Reoch in March 1616, she was alleged to have plucked &quot;melefour&quot;, thought to be another name for yarrow, and said &quot;In nomine Patris, Fiili, et Spiritus Sancti&quot; to become able to cure distemper (disorders of the four humours) and impart the faculty of prediction. For its association with the Abrahamic devil it was called &quot;bad man&#x27;s plaything&quot;, &quot;devil&#x27;s nettle&quot;, and &quot;devil&#x27;s plaything&quot;. Yarrow was thought to bring luck due to being, according to one woman cited by James Britten (), &quot;the first herb our Saviour put in His hand when a child&quot;. This is apparently a corruption of the Achilles myth in which Jesus uses the plant to heal his adoptive father. For this reason, in France, it was called &quot;&#x27;herbe de&quot; St. Joseph&#x27;, and it has also been called &#x27;carpenter&#x27;s weed&#x27; in this regard.

Various other common names include &quot;arrowroot&quot;, &quot;death flower&quot;, &quot;eerie&quot;, &quot;hundred-leaved grass&quot;, &quot;knyghten&quot;, &quot;old man&#x27;s mustard&quot;, &quot;sanguinary&quot;, &quot;seven-year&#x27;s love&quot;, &quot;snake&#x27;s grass&quot;, and &quot;soldier&quot;. The names &quot;milfoil&quot; and &quot;thousand leaf&quot; come refer to the minutely divided leaves. In Spanish, it is known as &quot;gordaldo&quot; and, in New Mexico and southern Colorado, &quot;plumajillo&quot; (Spanish for &#x27;little feather&#x27;).

In Sussex and Devonshire superstition, yarrow was used for finding one&#x27;s real sweetheart. One would pluck yarrow growing on a young man&#x27;s grave while reciting:
:Yarrow, sweet yarrow, the first that I have found,in the name of Jesus Christ, I pluck it from the ground;As Joseph loved sweet Mary, and took her for his dear,so in a dream this night, I hope, my true love will appear.
and go to sleep with the yarrow under the pillow.

In a similar tradition in Wicklow, girls would pick yarrow on Hallow Eve and recite:
:Thou pretty herb of Venus&#x27; tree,Thy true name is yarrow;Now who my bosom friend may be,Pray tell thou me to-morrow.
then retire for the night without speaking and go to sleep with an ounce of yarrow sewn in flannel under the pillow.

In Suffolk a leaf was placed in the nose so it would bleed, while reciting
:Green &#x27;arrow, green &#x27;arrow, you bears a white blow,If my love love me, my nose will bleed now;If my love don&#x27;t love me, it &#x27;on&#x27;t bleed a drop,If my love do love me, &#x27;twill bleed every drop.

In Dublin on May Day or the night before, women would place a stocking full of yarrow under their pillow and recite:
:Good morrow, good yarrow, good morrow to thee,I hope by the yarrow my lover to see;And that he may be married to me.The colour of his hair and the clothes he does wear,And if he be for me may his face be turned to me,And if he be not, dark and surely may he be,And his back be turned toward me.

<text>Hever Castle ( ) is located in the village of Hever, Kent, near Edenbridge, south-east of London, England. It began as a country house, built in the 13th century. From 1462 to 1539, it was the seat of the Boleyn (originally &#x27;Bullen&#x27;) family.

Anne Boleyn, the second queen consort of King Henry VIII of England, spent her early youth there after her father, Thomas Boleyn, inherited it in 1505. The castle passed to him upon the death of his father, Sir William Boleyn. It later came into the possession of King Henry VIII&#x27;s fourth wife, Anne of Cleves.

The Grade I listed castle is now owned by the Guthrie family&#x27;s Broadland Properties.

==History==
There have been three main periods in the construction of this historic castle. The castle&#x27;s oldest part dates to 1270 and consisted of the gatehouse and a walled bailey. It was then owned by James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele. The second period was when the castle, then in need of repair, was converted into a manor in 1462 by Geoffrey Boleyn, younger brother of Thomas Boleyn, Master of Gonville Hall, Cambridge. He added a Tudor dwelling within the walls. The third period of repair and renovation was in the 20th century, when it was acquired by William Waldorf Astor. 
Geoffrey Boleyn&#x27;s grandson, Thomas Boleyn, inherited the castle in 1505. He lived there with his wife Lady Elizabeth Howard and their children George, Mary and Anne (the future wife of Henry VIII). It is not known if Anne was born at Hever (the year of her birth is not certain), but she lived there until she was sent to the Netherlands in 1513 to receive an education at the court of the Archduchess Margaret. Henry VIII often used the nearby Bolebroke Castle to conduct his courtship with Anne.

The property came into the possession of Henry VIII after the death of Anne&#x27;s father, Thomas Boleyn, in 1539. He bestowed it upon Anne of Cleves in 1540 as part of the settlement following the annulment of their marriage. Hever Castle still has one of Henry VIII&#x27;s private locks, taken with him on his various visits to noblemen&#x27;s houses and fitted to every door for his security.

The property subsequently passed through various owners, including the Waldegrave family from 1557 to 1715, the Humfreys family to 1749 and the Meade-Waldo family from 1749 to 1903. During this latter period of ownership, the castle fell into a poor state of repair, during which time it was leased to various private tenants.

In 1903, it was acquired and restored by the American millionaire William Waldorf Astor, who used it as a family residence. He completed a restoration, added the Tudor village (also known as the Astor Wing) and also added the Italian Garden to display his collection of statuary and ornaments.

The castle has been Grade I listed since 10 September 1954; that was after the addition of the Tudor village, &quot;a picturesque cluster of guest cottages&quot;.

In 1983, the Astor family sold the castle to John Guthrie (1906-1992), chairman of the family-run business, Broadland Properties Limited.

The castle was used as the location for music videos. The Loggia on the lake was used as the location for a peace conference in the comedy-drama &quot;The Great&quot;. Other productions that have filmed on the property include &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and &quot;Inkheart&quot;.

==Attractions for tourists==

Hever Castle is now a tourist attraction, drawing on its links to Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII, its mazes, gardens and lakes. There is an annual event programme with assorted events, including jousting tournaments and archery displays in the summer months and an annual patchwork and quilting exhibition in September. The castle has also become the venue for a triathlon and open water swimming. The castle has three floors containing antique furniture, Anne Boleyn&#x27;s prayer books, instruments of torture, and a large collection of Tudor paintings. There is also a museum of the Kent and Sharpshooters Yeomanry.

The remains of the original country house timbers can still be seen within the stone walls of the fortification, while the gatehouse is the only original part of the castle. It has the oldest working original portcullis in England. The grounds of the castle include a yew maze, planted in 1904. There is also a water maze, opened in 1999, the object of which is to reach the folly at the centre without getting wet. In the children&#x27;s adventure playground, there is a tower maze (currently undergoing reconstruction). The castle gardens contain a wide range of features, including an Italianate garden (including Fernery), rose gardens, herb garden, and topiary.

The castle has 28 B&amp;B rooms that can be rented in a B&amp;B format. The castle has three restaurants, located in the gardens.

<text>Berkeley Plantation, one of the first plantations in America, comprises about on the banks of the James River on State Route 5 in Charles City County, Virginia. Berkeley Plantation was originally called Berkeley Hundred, named after the Berkeley Company of England. In 1726, it became the home of the Harrison family of Virginia, after Benjamin Harrison IV located there and built one of the first three-story brick mansions in Virginia. It is the ancestral home of two presidents of the United States: William Henry Harrison, who was born there in 1773 and his grandson Benjamin Harrison. It is now a museum property, open to the public.

Among the many American &quot;firsts&quot; that occurred at Berkeley Plantation are:

* In 1619 settlers celebrated the first annual Thanksgiving celebration after landing at Berkeley Hundred.
* In 1862 the Army bugle call &quot;Taps&quot; was first played, by bugler Oliver W. Norton; the melody was written at Harrison&#x27;s Landing, the plantation&#x27;s old wharf, by Norton and General Daniel Butterfield.

==History==

On December 4, 1619, a group of 38 English settlers arrived at Berkeley Hundred, about on the north bank of the James River near Herring Creek in an area then known as Charles Cittie (sic). It was named for one of the original founders, Richard Berkeley, a member of the Berkeley family of Gloucestershire, England. It was about 20 miles upstream from Jamestown, where the first permanent settlement of the Colony of Virginia was established on May 14, 1607.

The group&#x27;s London Company charter required that the day of arrival be observed as a day of thanksgiving to God. On that first day, Captain John Woodlief held a service pursuant to the charter which specified, &quot;Wee ordaine that the day of our ships arrival at the place assigned for plantacon in the land of Virginia shall be yearly and perpetually keept holy as a day of thanksgiving to Almighty God.&quot;. Because of this, the Berkeley Plantation had one of the first recorded celebrations of Thanksgiving in the United States.
During the Indian massacre of 1622, nine of the settlers at Berkeley Hundred were killed, as well as about a third of the entire population of the Virginia Colony. The Berkeley Hundred site and other outlying locations were abandoned as the colonists withdrew to Jamestown and other more secure points. In 1634, Charles Cittie became part of the first eight shires of Virginia, as Charles City County, one of the oldest in the United States, and is located along Virginia State Route 5, which runs parallel to the river&#x27;s northern borders past sites of many of the James River Plantations between the colonial capital city of Williamsburg (now the site of Colonial Williamsburg) and the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia at Richmond.

In 1636 William Tucker, Maurice Thompson, George Thompson, William Harris, Thomas Deacon, James Stone, Cornelius Lloyd of London, merchants and Jeremiah Blackman of London, mariner, and their associates and company patented the 8,000 acres known as Berkeley Hundred. After several decades, the site of Berkeley Hundred became the property of Theodorick Bland of Westover. A portion of the Berkeley Hundred patent was purchased from descendant Giles Bland by Benjamin Harrison III. His son Benjamin Harrison IV built the three-story brick mansion that became the seat of the Harrison family, one of the First Families of Virginia.
Using bricks fired on the Berkeley plantation, Benjamin Harrison IV built a Georgian-style two-story brick mansion on a hill overlooking the James River in 1726. Harrison&#x27;s son, Benjamin Harrison V, a signer of the American Declaration of Independence and a governor of Virginia, was born at Berkeley Plantation, as was his son William Henry Harrison, a war hero in the Battle of Tippecanoe, governor of Indiana Territory, and ninth president of the United States. Berkeley would later earn a distinction shared only with Peacefield in Quincy, Massachusetts, as the ancestral home for two United States presidents, though this connection is tenuous, as William Henry Harrison&#x27;s grandson, the 23rd president, Benjamin Harrison, was born and reared in North Bend, Ohio, and his father, John Scott Harrison, was born in Vincennes, Indiana, while his father (William Henry Harrison) was the first territorial governor of the Indiana Territory.

The first 10 U.S. presidents were all hosted by the Harrison family on this property at some point: George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, William Henry Harrison (who was born on the property), and John Tyler (who lived nearby) are all known to have visited Berkeley. 

By the time Benjamin Harrison VII inherited Berkeley in 1799, the land was worn out after more than two centuries of mono-culture tobacco and cotton crops and the plantation was drifting towards financial ruin. After 150 years of Harrison family ownership plantation was foreclosed on by a local bank and the family evicted. Benjamin Harrison VII was the last Harrison to own Berkeley.

During the American Civil War, Union troops occupied Berkeley Plantation, and President Abraham Lincoln twice visited there in the summer of 1862 to confer with Gen. George B. McClellan. The Harrisons were unable to regain possession of the plantation after the war, and it was rented out by the bank from time to time to tenant farmers and the mansion was eventually used as a barn, falling into such disrepair that it was uninhabitable.

===Restoration===
John Jamieson, a lumber tycoon who as a youth had been at Berkeley as a drummer boy in McClellan&#x27;s army, purchased the property in 1907. In 1925, his son Malcolm inherited the property, expending large sums of money to turn the ruined main house into a livable and stately home for himself and his bride Grace Eggleston. The project took over a decade and the mansion was finally occupied by the Jamisons in 1938. 
The ground floor of the mansion was turned into a museum in the 1960s. Today the house attracts visitors from the United States and other parts of the world.

The architecture is original, and the house has been filled with antique furniture and furnishings that date from the period when it was built. The grounds, too, have been restored, and cuttings from the boxwood gardens are available as living souvenirs for its visitors.
Berkeley is still a working farm; corn, soybeans, wheat, tomatoes, and other vegetables are grown here.

There is also a small family cemetery on the property. Among those buried here are Benjamin Harrison V, Grace Jamieson, and Malcolm Jamieson.

Reconstructed slave quarters were built on the property in 2018 by the producers of &quot;Harriet&quot;, a movie about Harriet Tubman that was filmed in part at the plantation. The original quarters were no longer extant at that point. Plantation owner Benjamin Harrison V held 110 people in slavery at the time of his death in 1791.

==Exterior==
The main house is the centerpiece of ten acres of formal gardens and parterres. The house is surrounded by boxwood hedges forming allées. Large pillars with decorative spires support large hinged gates.

The house is constructed of red brick with thin mortar joints. The two-story building&#x27;s main entrance is in the center of the house, with two symmetrical windows on either side and a central window directly above the door. These windows are double sashed with 12 panes per sash. An entablature with dentil moldings support the gabled roof, which is pierced by three dormer windows and two large brick chimneys.

The grounds include a two-story gabled guest house, with symmetrical one-story wings on each side. In 1862, during the American Civil War and while the Union Army of the Potomac was camped at Berkeley Plantation, Confederates under General J.E.B. Stuart shot a cannonball into the side of the house from the nearby James River. The cannonball was never removed, and is still visible today. It is indicated with a small marker.

<doc id="74185" wikidata="Q6692993" url="?curid=74185" title="Low comedy">
<text>Low comedy, or lowbrow humor, is a type of comedy that is a form of popular entertainment without any primary purpose other than to create laughter through boasting, boisterous jokes, drunkenness, scolding, fighting, buffoonery and other riotous activity. It is characterized by &quot;horseplay&quot;, slapstick or farce. Examples include the throwing of a custard pie into someone&#x27;s face. The definition has expanded to include obvious physical jokes, such as the wedgie.

The term &quot;low comedy&quot; was coined by John Dryden in his preface to his play &quot;An Evening&#x27;s Love&quot;.

== History ==
This type of comedy has been a fixture ever since Greek plays. For instance Sophocles once wrote a satyr play, no longer extant, about satyrs who seek to persuade a king that they are worthy suitors of his daughter by bragging about their capacity for flatulence. Aristophanes claimed that he hoped his plays would not be too highbrow for the common people to understand though he acknowledged that his work presupposed a level of intelligence that was not normally assumed. Even the word &#x27;comedy&#x27; is derived from a Greek phrase meaning either Song of Revelry or Song of The Village, the latter of which implies that it is meant for everyone including the lowest common denominator.

Low comedy was first denoted as comedy for the commoners because it was most often practiced by street performers. Over time, as low comedy began to include lewd jokes and more physical comedy, more mainstream performers began to practice this type of comedy: stand-up comedians, musicals, etc. This type of comedy also was employed in most cartoons. For instance, in &quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot;, Porky Pig is routinely subjected to physical slapstick. A 1945 Bugs Bunny cartoon which parodied and lampooned Hermann Goering included a scene wherein Bugs successfully tore off Göring&#x27;s medals one by one and Göring&#x27;s trousers fell off. Likewise Daffy Duck is routinely shot by Elmer Fudd in &quot;wabbit season&quot; cartoons.

== Social context ==
Low comedy in society is quite well known; it can be found in a wide range of media, such as television and theatre. It can also be found in , such as clowns, mimes and comedians. The term &quot;low&quot; is represented in association to low culture. This form of comedy is targeted and understood towards people who attain nonacademic high school education, meaning this form of comedy is not restricted to high levels of education and knowledge. Low comedy is well known and popular today because it is considered suitable for all individuals. This form of comedy connects to popular culture by its easy to understand style.

Low comedy, however, has lacked appreciation from most of society and is looked down upon in contrast to high comedy. The sole purpose of low comedy is to evoke laughter in people. Because there is no contextual message in most forms of low comedy, it is not highly respected. This does not undermine the fact that it is still an effective form of comedy for its reputation to cause laughter.

The classification of things considered to be low comedy constantly changes over time. As society changes, so do the ideas about what high and low comedy is. For example, due to the overdoing of sitcoms in the past, it is now considered shrill, vulgar, low society where everyone talk-screeches in some sub-human, mock-sophisticated language of incessant insult. Some sitcoms are somewhere in between low and high comedy. For instance the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; routinely includes slapstick violence, yet has also satirized political issues and parodied classic films and literature.

Today, low comedy can be seen in almost any production. Sitcoms often base most of the plot on this type of comedy because of society influencing productivity and considering it a low form of comedy. Modern adaptations of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays also use low comedy to convey a different understanding of the play. &quot;As You Like It&quot; for example is the story of a woman named Rosalyn who meets her male love interest while disguised as a man and inadvertently arouses the affection of a woman named Phoebe who repeatedly rejects her male suitor because she is in love with the man that Rosalyn is pretending to be.

<text>County Waterford () is a county in Ireland. It is in the province of Munster and is part of the Southern Region. It is named after the city of Waterford. Waterford City and County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county at large, including the city, was 127,363 according to the 2022 census. The county is based on the historic Gaelic territory of the &quot;Déise&quot;. There is an Irish-speaking area, Gaeltacht na nDéise, in the southwest of the county.

==Geography and subdivisions==
County Waterford has two mountain ranges, the Knockmealdown Mountains and the Comeragh Mountains. The highest point in the county is Knockmealdown, at . It also has many rivers, including Ireland&#x27;s third-longest river, the River Suir (); and Ireland&#x27;s fourth-longest river, the Munster Blackwater (). There are over 30 beaches along Waterford&#x27;s volcanic coastline. A large stretch of this coastline, known as the Copper Coast, has been designated as a UNESCO Geopark, a place of great geological importance. To the west of Dungarvan is the Déise Gaeltacht, an Irish-speaking region comprising the areas of Ring, County Waterford and Old Parish.

Waterford is the county seat; prior to the merger of the 2 Waterford authorities in June 2014 Dungarvan was the county seat for Waterford County Council.

===Baronies===
There are eight historic baronies in the county: Coshmore and Coshbride, Decies-within-Drum, Decies-without-Drum, Gaultiere, Glenahiry, Middlethird, Upperthird and Waterford City.

===Largest towns===

==History==

County Waterford is colloquially known as &quot;The Déise&quot;, pronounced &quot;day-shah&quot; or, in Irish, /dʲe:ʃʲɪ/ (). Some time between the 4th and 8th centuries, an Irish tribe called the Déisi were driven from southern county Meath/north Kildare and moved into the Waterford region, conquering and settling there. The ancient principality of the Déise is today roughly coterminous with the current Roman Catholic Diocese of Waterford and Lismore thus including part of south County Tipperary.

The westernmost of the baronies are Decies-within-Drum and Decies-without-Drum, separated by the Drum-Fineen hills.
There are many megalithic tombs and ogham stones in the county. The Viking influence can still be seen with Reginald&#x27;s Tower, one of the first buildings to use a brick and mortar construction method in Ireland. Woodstown, a settlement dating to the 9th century, was discovered west of Waterford city. It was the largest settlement outside Scandinavia and the only large-scale 9th-century Viking settlement discovered to date in Western Europe. Other architectural features are products of the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland and its effects.

==Local government and politics==
As of 1 June 2014, Waterford City and County Council is the local government authority for the local government area of Waterford City and County. The authority was formed following the merger of the local government areas of the county of Waterford and the city of Waterford under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, and succeeded the functions of Waterford City Council and Waterford County Council. The local authority is responsible for certain local services such as sanitation, planning and real-estate development, libraries, the collection of automobile taxation, local roads and social housing.

<text>Picinae containing the true woodpeckers is one of four subfamilies that make up the woodpecker family Picidae. True woodpeckers are found over much of the world, but do not occur in Madagascar or Australasia.

Woodpeckers gained their English name because of the habit of some species of tapping and pecking noisily on tree trunks with their beaks and heads. This is both a means of communication to signal possession of territory to their rivals, and a method of locating and accessing insect larvae found under the bark or in long winding tunnels in the tree or upright log.
== Physiology and behaviour ==
Some woodpeckers and wrynecks in the order Piciformes have zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. These feet, though adapted for clinging to a vertical surface, can be used for grasping or perching. Several species have only three toes. The woodpecker&#x27;s long tongue, in many cases as long as the woodpecker itself, can be darted forward to capture insects. The tongue is not attached to the woodpecker&#x27;s head in the same way as it is in most birds, but instead it curls back up around its skull, which allows it to be so long.

The woodpecker first locates a by tapping on the trunk with its head. Once a tunnel is found, the woodpecker chisels out wood until it makes an opening into the tunnel. Then it worms its tongue into the tunnel to try to locate the grub. The tongue of the woodpecker is long and ends in a barb. With its tongue the woodpecker skewers the grub and draws it out of the trunk.

Woodpeckers also use their beaks to create larger holes for their nests which are 15–45 cm (6–18 inches) below the opening. These nests are lined only with wood chips and hold 2–8 white eggs. Because the nests are out of sight, they are not visible to predators and eggs do not need to be camouflaged. Cavities created by woodpeckers are also reused as nests by other birds, such as grackles, starlings, some ducks and owls, and mammals, such as tree squirrels.

Several adaptations combine to protect the woodpecker&#x27;s brain from the substantial pounding that the pecking behaviour causes: it has a relatively thick skull with relatively spongy bone to cushion the brain; there is very little cerebrospinal fluid in its small subarachnoid space; the bird contracts mandibular muscles just before impact, thus transmitting the impact past the brain and allowing its whole body to help absorb the shock; its relatively small brain is less prone to concussion than other animals&#x27;.

Some species have modified joints between bones in the skull and upper jaw, as well as muscles which contract to absorb the shock of the hammering. Strong neck and tail-feather muscles, and a chisel-like bill are other hammering adaptations which are seen in most species. Other species of woodpecker, such as the Flicker, uses its long tongue primarily to grab prey from the ground or from under loose bark. It has few shock-absorbing adaptations, and prefers to feed on the ground or to chip away at rotting wood and bark, habits observed in birds outside of the woodpecker family. A &quot;continuum&quot; in skull structures, from little- to highly specialized for pounding is seen in different genera (groups of related species) of woodpeckers alive today. In his classic &quot;Birds of America,&quot; John James Audubon describes the slight gradations in hyoid horn length found in different species of living woodpeckers. The slack of tongue is kept under the loose skin behind its neck. The tiny bones divide into essentially two tongues, coming back together before entering the beak.

== Systematics ==
The systematics of woodpeckers is quite convoluted. Based on an assumption of unrealistically low convergence in details of plumage and behavior, 5 subfamilies were distinguished. However, it has turned out that similar plumage patterns and modes of life are not reliable to determine higher phylogenetic relationships in woodpeckers, and thus only 3 subfamilies should be accepted.

For example, the genera &quot;Dryocopus&quot; (Eurasia and Americas) and &quot;Campephilus&quot; (Americas) of large woodpeckers were believed to form a distinct group. However, they are quite unrelated and instead close, respectively, to the genera, &quot;Mulleripicus&quot; and &quot;Chrysocolaptes&quot;, of Southeast Asia. In addition, the genus allocation of many species, e.g. the rufous woodpecker, has turned out to be in error, and some taxa with unclear relationships could be placed into the phylogeny.

In 1975 John Morony and colleagues in their &quot;Reference List of the Birds of the World&quot; divided the true woodpeckers into six tribes: Melanerpini, Campetherini, Colaptini, Campephilini, Picini, Meiglyptini. This classification was used in 1982 by Lesley Short in his &quot;Woodpeckers of the World&quot;. The introduction of molecular methods led to a substantial reorganization of the phylogeny making the earlier groups obsolete. In 2005 David Webb and William Moore divided the main woodpecker genera into three tribes: Megapicini, Malarpicini and Dendropicini. These names were rapidly accepted by other ornithologists but in 2013 Edward Dickinson and Leslie Christidis in the fourth edition of the &quot;Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World&quot; rejected these new names on the grounds that the earlier names had precedence. Webb and Moore&#x27;s Malarpicini, Megapicini and Dendropicini were replaced by Pici, Campephilini and Melanerpini. Dickinson and Christidis also introduced Nesoctitini for the Antillean piculets and Hemicircini for the two species in Hemicircus giving a total of five tribes.

===Genera===

The world bird list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union recognises 208 species of true woodpecker which are split up into 33 genera. The division into tribes is based on the 2017 study by Sabir Shakya and colleagues.

<doc id="74195" wikidata="Q229205" url="?curid=74195" title="Sitar">
<text>The sitar ( or ; ) is a plucked stringed instrument, originating from the Indian subcontinent, used in Hindustani classical music. The instrument was invented in the 18th century, and arrived at its present form in 19th-century India. Khusrau Khan, an 18th-century figure of the Mughal Empire has been identified by modern scholarship as the inventor of the sitar. According to most historians, he developed the sitar from the setar, an Iranian instrument of Abbasid or Safavid origin.

Used widely throughout the Indian subcontinent, the sitar became popularly known in the wider world through the works of Ravi Shankar, beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The advent of psychedelic culture during the mid-to-late 1960s set a trend for the use of the sitar in Western popular music, with the instrument appearing on tracks by bands such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Metallica and many others.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;sitar&quot; is derived from the Persian word , meaning . According to Curt Sachs, Persians chose to name their lutes around the word &quot;tar&quot;, meaning string, combined with a word for the number of strings. Du + tar is the 2-stringed dutār, se + tar is the 3-stringed setār, čartar (4 strings), pančtār (5 strings).

== History ==

It was theorized that the sitar was invented, or rather developed by Amir Khusrow ( 1253–1325), a famous Sufi inventor, poet and pioneer of Khyal, Tarana and Qawwali, during the 13th century. However, the tradition of Amir Khusrow is considered discredited by scholars. Whatever instruments he might have played, no record exists from this period using the name &quot;sitar&quot;. An ambiguous statement made in a 19th century work by Captain N. Augustus Willard may have resulted in the incorrect association of the renowned poet Amir Khusrau with a later individual, potentially named Khusrau Khan, who lived during the 18th century.

The earliest mention of Sitar dates back to 1739 AD. The &quot;Muraqqa-i-Dehli&quot;, written by Dargah Quli Khan during the reign of Muhammad Shah Rangila, gives the earliest reference to the sitar. Oral and textual evidence analysed by historians indicate that an eighteenth-century figure of the Mughal court, named Khusrau Khan originated the sitar from the small persian three-stringed setar. In the late Mughal Empire, the instrument began to take on its modern shape. The neck got wider. The bowl, which had been made of glued lathes of wood was now made of gourd, with metal frets and a bone nut on the neck. Masid Khan added two more strings to the sitar. The modern seven string sitar was created by Allauddin Khan. Sympathetic strings on sitar were first added by Ustad Imdad Khan. The earliest compositional style specifically for the sitar emerged in the mid-eighteenth century, attributed to Firoz Khan, who was either the son or nephew of Khusrau Khan.

Another, discredited hypothesis is that the sitar is derived from locally developed Indian instruments, such as the veena, prior to the arrival of Islam. Proponents of this hypothesis claim that Indian temple sculptures from the 9th and 10th centuries feature sitar-like instruments. However, according to author Samidha Vedabala, a researcher and professor of music at Sikkim University, none of the instruments depicted in these sculptures precisely resemble the sitar, and neither the word &quot;sitar&quot; nor any local equivalent appears in any texts referring to these instruments. So its authenticity is in the absolute dark. According to Allyn Miner, the evidence for this hypothesis is too weak for any conclusion and these hypotheses represent a prominent yet obsolete late 19th-century idea: that many of India’s modern cultural innovations are actually products of pre-Muslim Sanskritic traditions. According to Alastair Dick, the &quot;modern view that ... invading Muslims simply changed into Persian the name of an existing Hindu instrument ... has no historical or musical foundation&quot;. Other scholars have contested the veena origin hypotheses of the sitar by pointing out that proponents of these hypotheses select the number of strings as the primary criterion in coming to their conclusions. Additionally, they attempt to trace the sitar back to a known Indian musical instrument with a Sanskrit name, while acknowledging that there is no evidence for the existence of long-necked lutes in the Indian subcontinent prior to the era of Muslim expansion into the region.

==Physical description==
A sitar can have 18, 19, 20, or 21 strings; 6 or 7 of these run over curved, raised frets and are played strings; the remainder are sympathetic strings (&quot;tarb&quot;, also known as &quot;taarif&quot; or &quot;tarafdaar&quot;), running underneath the frets and resonating in sympathy with the played strings. These strings are generally used to set the mood of a raga at the very beginning of a presentation. The frets, which are known as or thaat, are movable, allowing fine tuning. The played strings run to tuning pegs on or near the head of the instrument, while the sympathetic strings, which have a variety of different lengths, pass through small holes in the fretboard to engage with the smaller tuning pegs that run down the instrument&#x27;s neck.

The instrument has two bridges: the large bridge (&quot;badaa goraa&quot;) for the playing and drone strings and the small bridge (&quot;chota goraa&quot;) for the sympathetic strings. Its timbre results from the way the strings interact with the wide, rounded bridge. As a string vibrates, its length changes slightly as one edge moves along the rounded bridge, promoting the creation of overtones and giving the sound its distinctive tone. The maintenance of this specific tone by shaping the bridge is called &quot;jawari&quot;. Many musicians rely on instrument makers to adjust this.

Materials used in construction include teak wood or &quot;tun&quot; wood (&quot;Cedrela toona&quot;), which is a variation of mahogany, for the neck and faceplate (&quot;tabli&quot;), and calabash gourds for the resonating chambers. The instrument&#x27;s bridges are made of deer horn, ebony, or very occasionally from camel bone. Synthetic material is now common as well.

== Construction styles ==

There are two popular modern styles of sitar: the fully decorated &quot;instrumental style&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;Ravi Shankar style&quot;) and the &quot;gayaki&quot; style (sometimes called the &quot;Vilayat Khan&quot; style).
The instrumental style sitar is most often made of seasoned toon wood, but sometimes made of Teak. It is often fitted with a second resonator, a small tumba (pumpkin or pumpkin-like wood replica) on the neck. This style is usually fully decorated, with floral or grape carvings and celluloid inlays with colored (often brown or red) and black floral or arabesque patterns. It typically has 13 sympathetic strings. It is said that the best Teak sitars are made from teak that has been seasoned for generations. The sources of very old seasoned wood are guarded trade secrets. Therefore, instrument builders look for old Teak that was used in old colonial-style villas as whole trunk columns for their special sitar constructions. 
There are various additional sub-styles and cross mixes of styles in sitars, according to customer preferences. Most importantly, there are some differences in preferences for the positioning of sympathetic (&quot;taraf&quot;) string pegs (see photo).

Amongst all sitar styles, there are student styles, beginner models, semi-pro styles, pro-models, master models, and so on. Prices are often determined by the manufacturer&#x27;s name and not by looks alone or materials used. Some sitars by certain manufacturers fetch very high collectible prices. Most notable are older Rikhi Ram (Delhi) and older Hiren Roy (Kolkata) sitars, depending upon which master built the instrument. Nikhil Banerjee had a small extra bridge fixed at the top of the Sitar fingerboard for sustenance of sound.

==Tuning of sitar==
Tuning depends on the sitarist&#x27;s school or style, tradition and each artist&#x27;s personal preference. The main playing string is almost invariably tuned a perfect fourth &quot;above&quot; the tonic, the second string being tuned to the tonic. The tonic in the Indian solfège system is referred to as &quot;ṣaḍja&quot;, &quot;ṣaḍaj&quot;, or the shortened form &quot;sa&quot;, or &quot;khaṛaj&quot;, a dialectal variant of &quot;ṣaḍaj&quot;, not as &quot;vād&quot;, and the perfect fifth to which one or more of the drones strings are tuned is referred to as &quot;pañcam&quot;, not &quot;samvād&quot;.

The player should re-tune for each raga. Strings are tuned by tuning pegs, and the main playing strings can be fine-tuned by sliding a bead threaded on each string just below the bridge.
In one or more of the more common tunings (used by Ravi Shankar, among others, called &quot;Kharaj Pancham&quot; sitar) the playable strings are strung in this fashion:
* &quot;Chikari&quot; strings: Sa (high), Sa (middle), and Pa.
* &quot;Kharaj&quot; (bass) strings: Sa (low) and Pa (low).
* &quot;Jod&quot; and &quot;baaj&quot; strings, Sa and Ma.

There is a lot of stylistic variance within these tunings, and like most Indian stringed instruments, there is no default tuning. Mostly, tunings vary by schools of teaching (gharana) and the piece that is meant to be played.

==Playing==
The instrument is balanced between the player&#x27;s left foot and right knee. The hands move freely without having to carry any of the instrument&#x27;s weight. The player plucks the string using a metallic pick or plectrum called a mizraab. The thumb stays anchored on the top of the fretboard just above the main gourd. Generally, only the index and middle fingers are used for fingering although a few players occasionally use the third. A specialized technique called &quot;meend&quot; involves pulling the main melody string down over the bottom portion of the sitar&#x27;s curved frets, with which the sitarist can achieve a seven-semitone range of microtonal notes (however, because of the sitar&#x27;s movable frets, sometimes a fret may be set to a microtone already, and no bending would be required). This was developed by Vilayat Khan into a technique that imitated the melisma of the vocal style, a technique known as &quot;gayaki ang&quot;. Sometimes, sitar could played with a bow. Its sound is similar to sarangi, but raspier.

Adept players bring in charisma through the use of special techniques like Kan, Krintan, Murki, Zamzama, etc. They also use special Mizrab Bol-s, as in Misrabani.

==World music influence==

In the late 1950s and early 1960s Ravi Shankar, along with his tabla player, Alla Rakha, began a further introduction of Indian classical music to Western culture.

The sitar saw use in Western popular music when, guided by David Crosby&#x27;s championing of Shankar,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallo/Billboard&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; George Harrison played it on the Beatles&#x27; songs &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot;, &quot;Love You To&quot; and &quot;Within You Without You&quot;, recorded between 1965 and 1967. The Beatles&#x27; association with the instrument helped popularise Indian classical music among Western youth, particularly once Harrison began receiving tutelage from Shankar and the latter&#x27;s protégé Shambhu Das in 1966. That same year, Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones used a sitar on &quot;Paint It Black&quot;, while another English guitarist, Dave Mason, played it on Traffic&#x27;s 1967 hits &quot;Paper Sun&quot; and &quot;Hole in My Shoe&quot;. These and other examples marked a trend of featuring the instrument in pop songs, which Shankar later described as &quot;the great sitar explosion&quot;. Speaking to &quot;KRLA Beat&quot; in July 1967, he said: &quot;Many people, especially young people, have started listening to sitar since George Harrison, one of the Beatles, became my disciple ... It is now the &#x27;in&#x27; thing.&quot;
Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Jimmy Page talked about his love of Indian music, saying: &quot;I went to India after I came back from a tour with the Yardbirds in the late sixties just so I could hear the music firsthand. Let&#x27;s put it this way: I had a sitar before George Harrison got his. I wouldn&#x27;t say I played it as well as he did, though...&quot; Robbie Krieger&#x27;s guitar part on the Doors&#x27; 1967 track &quot;The End&quot; was heavily influenced by Indian ragas and features melodic and rhythmic qualities that suggest a sitar or veena. Many pop performances actually involve the electric sitar, which is a solid-body, guitar-like instrument and quite different from the traditional acoustic Indian instrument.

The Kinks&#x27; 1965 single &quot;See My Friends&quot; featured a &quot;low-tuned drone guitar&quot; that was widely mistaken to be a sitar. Crosby&#x27;s band, the Byrds, had similarly incorporated elements of Indian music, using &quot;only Western instrumentation&quot;, on their songs &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; and &quot;Why&quot; in 1966. Psychedelic music bands often used new recording techniques and effects and drew on non-Western sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music. The Electric Prunes appeared in early ads for the Vox Wah wah pedal, which touted the effect&#x27;s ability to make an electric guitar sound like a sitar.

Donovan&#x27;s personnel on his 1966 album &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; included Shawn Phillips on sitar. Phillips also played sitar on one song on Donovan&#x27;s next album &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot;, produced in 1967.

Starting in the late 1970s, Pakistan International Airlines in-flight music featured the sitar to evoke feelings of nostalgia for the homeland among the Pakistani diaspora.

Steve Howe of the British progressive rock band Yes played a Danelectro sitar guitar on their album &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; as well as the song &quot;To Be Over&quot; from their 1974 album &quot;Relayer&quot;. Deepak Khazanchi played sitar and tanpura on the song &quot;It Can Happen&quot;, from Yes&#x27; 1983 album &quot;90125&quot;.

Paul Young’s 1985 #1 Hit cover of Hall &amp; Oates’s song Everytime You Go Away included an electric sitar played by John Turnbull.

<text>Romanos III Argyros (; Latinized Romanus III Argyrus; 968 – 11 April 1034), or Argyropoulos was Byzantine Emperor from 1028 until his death in 1034. He was a Byzantine noble and senior official in Constantinople when the dying Constantine VIII forced him to divorce his wife and marry the emperor&#x27;s daughter Zoë. Upon Constantine&#x27;s death three days later, Romanos took the throne.

Romanos has been recorded as a well-meaning but ineffective emperor. He disorganised the tax system and undermined the military, personally leading a disastrous military expedition against Aleppo. He fell out with his wife and foiled several attempts on his throne, including two which revolved around his sister-in-law Theodora. He spent large amounts on the construction and repair of churches and monasteries. He died after six years on the throne, allegedly murdered, and was succeeded by his wife&#x27;s young lover, Michael IV.

==Life==

===Family and early career===

Romanos Argyros, born in 968, was the son of Marianos, a member of the Argyros family. Other hypotheses about his father are Pothos Argyros who defeated a Magyar raid in 958 (identified by some scholars with an older namesake), or Eustathios Argyros, known only for commissioning a poem in honour of Romanos II in 950. Romanos&#x27; father, Marianos, was the son of another Romanos Argyros, who had married Agatha, a daughter of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 919–944).

Romanos had several siblings: Basil Argyros, who served as general and governor under Basil II (r. 976–1025); Leo, who served under Basil and was killed in Italy in 1017; Pulcheria Argyropoulina, who married the &quot;magistros&quot; Basil Skleros; a sister who married Constantine Karantenos, who served as &quot;doux&quot; of Antioch under Romanos; and Maria Argyropoulina, who married Giovanni Orseolo, son of Doge Pietro II Orseolo.

He served as &quot;krites&quot; (judge) in Opsikion, with the rank of &quot;protospatharios&quot; (one of the highest judicial ranks, usually awarded to senior generals and provincial governors). In this capacity he persecuted heretics at Akmoneia. He was then promoted to the post of &quot;quaestor&quot; (the senior judicial official for the imperial capital, Constantinople) and became one of the judges of the Hippodrome, the High Court of the Empire. In this role he is mentioned in the &quot;Peira&quot;, a compendium of legal decisions compiled by the noted jurist Eustathios Rhomaios. He was promoted further to the rank of &quot;patrikios&quot; and the post of &quot;oikonomos&quot; (administrator) of the Great Church, while continuing to preside over the High Court. Under Emperor Constantine VIII he held the post of urban prefect of Constantinople, which made him the formal head of the Senate and one of the emperor&#x27;s chief lieutenants.

===Reign===

Late in 1028, Constantine VIII lay on his deathbed. Wishing to secure the Macedonian dynasty, but having no son, he summoned Constantine Dalassenos from Antioch to marry his oldest daughter, Zoë. Dalassenos, the &quot;doux&quot; of Antioch, was an experienced military commander, influential patrician, and unswervingly loyal to the ruling house. The emperor&#x27;s advisors preferred not to have a strong military figure as the new emperor, and persuaded the Emperor to choose Romanos instead, as a potentially more pliable and certainly less travelled candidate. Constantine VIII forced Romanos to divorce his wife (who was sent to a monastery) and to marry Zoë, aged 50 at the time; Romanos was 60. The marriage took place on 9 November 1028, and on the same ceremony Romanos was proclaimed &quot;caesar&quot;. Three days later, on 11 November, Constantine died of illness.

The new emperor was eager to make his mark as a ruler, but was mostly ineffectual in his enterprises. He idealised Marcus Aurelius, aspiring to be a new philosopher king, and similarly sought to imitate the military prowess of Trajan. He spent large sums on new buildings and in endowing churches and monasteries. He endeavoured to relieve the pressure of taxation on the aristocracy, which undermined the finances of the state. Previous emperors had attempted to control the privileges of the nobles over the common people. Coming from the aristocracy himself, Romanos III abandoned this policy. This failure to stand up to the aristocrats allowed them to exploit the rural mass of landed peasantry, who increasingly fell into a condition of serfdom. This in turn undermined the traditional recruiting base of the Byzantine army. The combination of a reduced tax base and fewer native-born troops had long-term consequences. As revenue declined, the subsequent impoverishment of the state weakened the military&#x27;s recruitment power still further.

In 1030 he resolved to lead an army in person against the Mirdasids of Aleppo, despite their having accepted the Byzantines as overlords, with disastrous results. The army camped at a waterless site and its scouts were ambushed. An attack by the Byzantine cavalry was defeated. That night Romanos held an imperial council at which the demoralised Byzantines resolved to abandon the campaign and return to Byzantine territory. Romanos also ordered his siege engines to be burned. On 10August 1030 the army departed its camp and made for Antioch. Discipline broke down in the Byzantine army, with Armenian mercenaries using the withdrawal as an opportunity to pillage the camp&#x27;s stores. The Emir of Aleppo launched an attack and the imperial army broke and fled. Only the imperial bodyguard, the &quot;Hetaireia&quot;, held firm, but Romanos was nearly captured. Accounts vary on the battle losses: John Skylitzes wrote that the Byzantines suffered a &quot;terrible rout&quot; and that some troops were killed in a chaotic stampede by their fellow soldiers, Yahya of Antioch wrote that the Byzantines suffered remarkably few casualties. According to Yahya, two high ranking Byzantine officers were among the fatalities, and another officer was captured by the Arabs. After this defeat the army became a &quot;laughing-stock&quot;.

Despite his victory, the Emir of Aleppo opened negotiations and signed a treaty that made Aleppo an Imperial tributary and allowed for a Greek governor to preside over the city. In 1032 the capture and successful defence of Edessa by George Maniakes and the sound defeat of a Saracen fleet in the Adriatic did little to restore Romanos&#x27; early popularity.

Romanos faced several conspiracies, mostly centred on his sister-in-law Theodora. In 1029 she planned to marry the Bulgarian prince Presian and to usurp the throne. The plot was discovered, Presian was blinded and tonsured as a monk but Theodora was not punished. In 1031 she was implicated in another conspiracy, this time with Constantine Diogenes, the Archon of Sirmium, and was forcibly confined in the monastery of Petrion.

In a vain attempt to reduce expenditure, Romanos limited his wife&#x27;s expenses, which merely exacerbated the alienation between the two. Romanos took a mistress. Zoë in turn fell in love with Michael, the brother of high-ranking court eunuch John the Orphanotrophos. Romanos, unaware, allowed Michael to become one of his personal servants. Having survived the attempts on his throne by Theodora, his death on 11 April 1034 was supposed to have been due to poison administered by his wife. There is also speculation that he was drowned in a bath on his wife&#x27;s orders. He was buried in the Church of St. Mary Peribleptos, which he built.

Zoë and Michael were married on the same day that Romanos III died. The next day the couple summoned the Patriarch Alexios I to officiate in the coronation of the new emperor. Although he initially refused to co-operate, the payment of 50 pounds of gold helped change his mind. He proceeded to crown Michael IV as the new emperor of the Romans.

<text>Connacht or Connaught ( ; or ), is one of the four provinces of Ireland, in the west of Ireland. Until the ninth century it consisted of several independent major Gaelic kingdoms (Uí Fiachrach, Uí Briúin, Uí Maine, Conmhaícne, and Delbhna).

Between the reigns of Conchobar mac Taidg Mór (died 882) and his descendant, Aedh mac Ruaidri Ó Conchobair (reigned 1228–33), it became a kingdom under the rule of the Uí Briúin Aí dynasty, whose ruling sept adopted the surname Ua Conchobair. At its greatest extent, it incorporated the often independent Kingdom of Breifne, as well as vassalage from the lordships of western Mide and west Leinster. Two of its greatest kings, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088–1156) and his son Ruaidri Ua Conchobair (c. 1115–1198) greatly expanded the kingdom&#x27;s dominance, so much so that both became High King of Ireland.

The Kingdom of Connacht collapsed in the 1230s because of civil war within the royal dynasty, which enabled widespread Hiberno-Norman settlement under Richard Mór de Burgh, 1st Baron of Connaught, and his successors. The Norman colony in Connacht shrank from c. 1300 to c. 1360, with events such as the 1307 battle of Ahascragh (see Donnchad Muimnech Ó Cellaigh), the 1316 Second Battle of Athenry and the murder in June 1333 of William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster, all leading to Gaelic resurgence and colonial withdrawal to towns such as Ballinrobe, Loughrea, Athenry, and Galway. Well into the 16th century, kingdoms such as Uí Maine and Tír Fhíacrach Múaidhe remained beyond English control, while many Norman families such as de Burgh, de Bermingham, de Exeter, de Staunton, became entirely Gaelicised. Only in the late 1500s, during the Tudor conquest of Ireland, was Connacht shired into its present counties.

Connacht&#x27;s population was 1,418,859 in 1841. Then came the Great Famine of the 1840s, which began a 120-year decline to under 400,000. The province has a population of just under 590,000 according to the preliminary results of the 2022 census.

Anglicisation was less prominent in the west of Ireland, and Connacht today has the highest number of Irish language speakers among the four Irish provinces. Currently, the total percentage of people who consider themselves as Irish speakers in Connacht is 39.8% (more than 202,000 persons). There are Gaeltacht areas in Counties Galway and Mayo.

The province of Connacht has no official function for local government purposes, but it is an officially recognised subdivision of the Irish state. It is listed on ISO-3166-2 as one of the four provinces of Ireland and &quot;IE-C&quot; is attributed to Connacht as its country sub-division code. Along with counties from other provinces, Connacht lies in the Midlands–North-West constituency for elections to the European Parliament.

== Name ==
The name comes from the medieval ruling dynasty, the &quot;Connacht&quot;, later Connachta, whose name means &quot;descendants of Conn&quot;, from the mythical king Conn of the Hundred Battles. The name of the province in the Irish language is &quot;Connachta&quot;. Originally &quot;Connacht&quot; was a singular collective noun, but it came to be used only in the plural &quot;Connachta&quot;, partly by analogy with plural names of other dynastic territories like Ulaid and Laigin, and partly because the Connachta split into different branches. Before the Connachta dynasty, the province (&quot;cúige&quot;, &quot;fifth&quot;) was known as Cóiced Ol nEchmacht. In Modern Irish, the province is usually called &quot;Cúige Chonnacht&quot;, &quot;the Province of Connacht&quot;, where &quot;Chonnacht&quot; is plural genitive case with lenition of the &quot;C&quot; to &quot;Ch&quot;.

The usual English spelling in Ireland since the Gaelic revival is &quot;Connacht&quot;, the spelling of the disused Irish singular. The official English spelling during English and British rule was the anglicisation &quot;Connaught&quot;, pronounced or . This was used for the Connaught Rangers, an Irish regiment in the British Army; in the title of Queen Victoria&#x27;s son Arthur, Duke of Connaught; and the Connaught Hotel, London, named after the Duke in 1917. Usage of the Connaught spelling is now in decline. State bodies use &quot;Connacht&quot;, for example in Central Statistics Office census reports since 1926, and the name of the Connacht–Ulster European Parliament constituency of 1979–2004, although &quot;Connaught&quot; occurs in some statutes. Among newspapers, the &quot;Connaught Telegraph&quot; (founded 1830) retains the anglicised spelling in its name, whereas the &quot;Connacht Tribune&quot; (founded 1909) uses the Gaelic. Connacht Rugby who represent the region and are based in Galway, use the Gaelic spelling also.

== Geography and political divisions ==
The province is divided into five traditional counties, the fewest of any province. These are: Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo. Connacht is the smallest of the four Irish provinces both in terms of size and population. Galway is the only official city in the province.

=== Largest settlements ===
=== Physical geography ===

The highest point of Connacht is Mweelrea (814 m), in County Mayo. The largest island in Connacht (and Ireland) is Achill. The biggest lake is Lough Corrib.

Much of the west coast (e.g. Connemara and Erris) is ruggedly inhospitable and not conducive for agriculture. It contains the main mountainous areas in Connacht, including the Twelve Bens, Maumturks, Mweelrea, Croagh Patrick, Nephin Beg, Ox Mountains, and Dartry Mountains.

Killary Harbour, one of Ireland&#x27;s fjords (the others being Carlingford Lough and Lough Swilly), is located at the foot of Mweelrea. Connemara National Park is in County Galway. The Aran Islands, featuring prehistoric forts such as Dún Aonghasa, have been a regular tourist destination since the 19th century.

Inland areas such as east Galway, Roscommon and Sligo have enjoyed greater historical population density due to better agricultural land and infrastructure.

Rivers and lakes include the River Moy, River Corrib, the Shannon, Lough Mask, Lough Melvin, Lough Allen and Lough Gill.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Up to the early historic era, Connacht then included County Clare, and was known as Cóiced Ol nEchmacht. Later myths state the Fir Bolg ruled all Ireland before the Tuatha Dé Danann arrived. When the Fir Bolg were defeated, the Tuatha Dé Danann drove them to Connacht. Sites such as the Céide Fields, Knocknarea, Listoghil, Carrowkeel Megalithic Cemetery and Rathcroghan, all demonstrate intensive occupation of Connacht far back into prehistory. Enigmatic artefacts such as the Turoe stone and the Castlestrange stone, whatever their purpose, denote the ambition and achievement of those societies, and their contact with the La Tène culture of mainland Europe. In the early historic era (c. A.D. 300 – c. A.D. 600), Ol nEchmacht was not a united kingdom but a region. It comprised dozens of major and minor túath; rulers of larger túatha (Maigh Seóla, Uí Maine, Aidhne and Máenmaige) were accorded high-king status, while peoples such as the Gailenga, Corco Moga and Senchineoil were lesser peoples given the status of Déisi. All were termed kingdoms, but according to a graded status, denoting each according the likes of lord, count, earl, king.

Some of the more notable peoples or ethnic groups included the following:

By the 5th century, the pre-historic nations such as the Auteini and Nagnatae – recorded by Ptolemy (c. AD 90 – c. 168) in &quot;Geography&quot; – gave way to dynasties. This is demonstrated in the noun &quot;moccu&quot; in names such as Muirchu moccu Machtheni, which indicated a person was &quot;of the Machtheni people.&quot; As evidenced by kings such as Mac Cairthinn mac Coelboth (died 446) and Ailill Molt (died c. 482), even by the 5th century the gens was giving way to kinship all over Ireland, as both men were identified as of the Uí Enechglaiss and Uí Fiachrach dynasties, not of tribes. By 700, &quot;moccu&quot; had been entirely replaced by &quot;mac&quot; and &quot;hua&quot; (later &quot;Mac&quot; and &quot;Ó&quot;).

During the mid-8th century, what is now County Clare was absorbed into Thomond by the Déisi Tuisceart. It has remained a part of the province of Munster ever since.

The name Connacht arose from the most successful of these early dynasties, The Connachta. By 1050, they had extended their rule from Rathcroghan in north County Roscommon to large areas of what are now County Galway, County Mayo, County Sligo, and County Leitrim. The dynastic term was from then on applied to the overall geographic area containing those counties, and has remained so ever since.

=== Kingdom of Connacht ===
The most successful sept of the Connachta were the Ó Conchobair of Síol Muireadaigh. They derived their surname from Conchobar mac Taidg Mór (c. 800 – 882), from whom all subsequent Ó Conchobair Kings of Connacht descended.

Conchobar was a nominal vassal of Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid, High King of Ireland (died 862). He married Máel Sechnaill&#x27;s daughter, Ailbe, and had sons Áed mac Conchobair (died 888), Tadg mac Conchobair (died 900) and Cathal mac Conchobair (died 925), all of whom subsequently reigned. Conchobar and his sons&#x27; descendants expanded the power of the Síol Muiredhaigh south into Uí Maine, west into Iar Connacht, and north into Uí Fiachrach Muaidhe and Bréifne.

By the reign of Áed in Gai Bernaig (1046–1067), Connacht&#x27;s kings ruled much what is now the province. Yet the Ó Conchobair&#x27;s contended for control with their cousins, the Ua Ruairc of Uí Briúin Bréifne. Four Ua Ruairc&#x27;s achieved rule of the kingdom – Fergal Ua Ruairc (956–967), Art Uallach Ua Ruairc (1030–1046), Áed Ua Ruairc (1067–1087), and Domnall Ua Ruairc (1098–1102). In addition, the usurper Flaithbertaigh Ua Flaithbertaigh gained the kingship in 1092 by the expedient of blinding King Ruaidrí na Saide Buide. After 1102 the Ua Ruairc&#x27;s and Ua Flaithbertaigh&#x27;s were suborned and confined to their own kingdoms of Bréifne and Iar Connacht. From then until the death of the last king in 1474, the kingship was held exclusively by the Ó Conchobair&#x27;s.

The single most substantial sub-kingdom in Connacht was Uí Maine, which at its maximum extent enclosed central and south County Roscommon, central, east-central and south County Galway, along with the territory of Lusmagh in Munster. Their rulers bore the family name Ó Ceallaigh; its spelling sometimes varying slightly from scribe to scribe.

Though the Ó Ceallaigh&#x27;s were never elevated to the provincial kingship, Uí Maine existed as a semi-independent kingdom both before and after the demise of the Connacht kingship.

=== Kings and High Kings ===

Under kings Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088–1156) and his son Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair (c. 1120–1198), Connacht became one of the five dominant kingdoms on the island. Tairrdelbach and Ruaidrí became the first men from west of the Shannon to gain the title &quot;Ard-Rí na hÉireann&quot; (High King of Ireland). In the latter&#x27;s case, he was recognised all over the island in 1166 as &quot;Rí Éireann&quot;, or King of Ireland.

Tairrdelbach was highly innovative, building the first stone castles in Ireland, and more controversially, introducing the policy of primogeniture to a hostile Gaelic polity. Castles were built in the 1120s at Galway (where he based his fleet), Dunmore, Sligo and Ballinasloe, where he dug a new six-mile canal to divert the river Suck around the castle of Dun Ló. Churches, monasteries and dioceses were re-founded or created, works such as the Corpus Missal, the High Cross of Tuam and the Cross of Cong were sponsored by him.

Tairrdelbach annexed the Kingdom of Mide; its rulers, the Clann Cholmáin, became his vassals. This brought two of Ireland&#x27;s five main kingdoms under the direct control of Connacht. He also asserted control over Dublin, which was even then being recognised as a kind of national capital.

His son, Ruaidrí, became king of Connacht &quot;without any opposition&quot; in 1156. One of his first acts as king was arresting three of his twenty-two brothers, &quot;Brian Breifneach, Brian Luighneach, and Muircheartach Muimhneach&quot; to prevent them from usurping him. He blinded Brian Breifneach as an extra precaution.

Ruaidrí was compelled to recognise Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn as Ard-Rí, though he went to war with him in 1159. Mac Lochlainn&#x27;s murder in 1166 left Ruaidrí the unopposed ruler of all Ireland. He was crowned in 1166 at Dublin, &quot;took the kingship of Ireland ...[and was] inaugurated king as honourably as any king of the Gaeidhil was ever inaugurated;&quot; He was the first and last native ruler who was recognised by the Gaelic-Irish as full King of Ireland.

However, his expulsion of Dermot MacMurrough later that year brought about the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. Ruaidrí&#x27;s inept response to events led to rebellion by his sons in 1177, and his deposition by Conchobar Maenmaige Ua Conchobair in 1183. Ruaidrí died at Cong in 1198, noted as the annals as late &quot;King of Connacht and of All Ireland, both the Irish and the English.&quot;

=== High medieval era ===

Connacht was first raided by the Anglo-Normans in 1177 but not until 1237 did encastellation begin under Richard Mor de Burgh (c. 1194–1242). New towns were founded (Athenry, Headford, Castlebar) or former settlements expanded (Sligo, Roscommon, Loughrea, Ballymote). Both &quot;Gael and Gall&quot; acknowledged the supreme lordship of the Earl of Ulster; after the murder of the last earl in 1333, the Anglo-Irish split into different factions, the most powerful emerging as Bourke of Mac William Eighter in north Connacht, and Burke of Clanricarde in the south. They were regularly in and out of alliance with equally powerful Gaelic lords and kings such as Ó Conchobair of Síol Muireadaigh, Ó Cellaigh of Uí Maine and Mac Diarmata of Moylurg, in addition to extraprovincial powers such as Ó Briain of Thomond, FitzGerald of Kildare, Ó Domhnaill of Tír Chonaill.

Lesser lords of both ethnicities included Mac Donnchadha, Mac Goisdelbh, Mac Bhaldrin, Mac Siurtain, Ó hEaghra, Ó Flaithbeheraigh, Ó Dubhda, Ó Seachnasaigh, Ó Manacháin, Seoighe, Ó Máille, Ó Ruairc, Ó Madadháin, Bairéad, Ó Máel Ruanaid, Ó hEidhin, Ó Finnaghtaigh, Ó Fallmhain, Breathneach, Mac Airechtaig, Ó Neachtain, Ó hAllmhuráin, Ó Fathaigh.

The town of Galway was the only significant urban area in the province. Its inhabitants governed themselves under charter of the king of England. Its merchant families, The Tribes of Galway, traded not only with the lordships around them and in Ireland, but with England, France, and Spain. Its mayor enjoyed supreme power but only for the length of his office, rarely more than a year. Galway&#x27;s inhabitants were of mixed descent, its families bearing surnames of Gaelic, French, English, Welsh, Norman and other origins.

Connacht was the site of two of the bloodiest battles in Irish history, the Second Battle of Athenry (1316) and the Battle of Knockdoe (1504). The casualties of both battles were measured in several thousand, unusually high for Irish warfare. A third battle at Aughrim in 1691 resulted in an estimated 10,000 deaths.

All of Connacht&#x27;s lordships remained in states of full or semi-independence from other Gaelic-Irish and Anglo-Irish rulers until the late 16th century, when the Tudor conquest of Ireland (1534–1603) brought all under the direct rule of King James I of England. The counties were created from c. 1569 onwards.

=== Confederate and Williamite Wars ===

During the 17th century representatives from Connacht played leading roles in Confederate Ireland and during the Williamite War in Ireland. Its main town, Galway, endured several sieges (see Sieges of Galway), while warfare, plague, famine and sectarian massacres killed about a third of the population by 1655. One of the last battles fought in pre-20th century Ireland occurred in Connacht, the Battle of Aughrim on 12 July 1691.

=== Early modern era ===

Connacht was mainly at peace between 1691 and 1798. In 1798 Connacht was a major backdrop to the Irish Rebellion of 1798 when French forces under General Jean Humbert of the French Republic landed in Killala, County Mayo to link up with the United Irishmen. Together, the French army and United Irishmen rebels defeated a force of Crown troops at the Races of Castlebar before proclaiming the Irish Republic, which later became better known as the &quot;Republic of Connacht&quot; as its area of effective control never extended beyond the province. The Republic, and the Rebellion itself, was effectively crushed at the Battle of Ballinamuck.

A population explosion in the early 18th century was curbed by the Irish Famine, which led to many deaths and some emigration. Its memory has been overshadowed by the Great Famine (Ireland) one hundred years later.

=== The Famine to World War I ===
Connacht was the worst hit area in Ireland during the Great Famine, in particular, counties Mayo and Roscommon. In the Census of 1841, the population of Connacht stood at 1,418,859, the highest ever recorded. By 1851, the population had fallen to 1,010,031 and would continue to decline until the late 20th century.

== Politics ==
Connacht–Ulster was one of Ireland&#x27;s four regional constituencies for elections to the European Parliament until it was superseded in 2004 by the constituency of North-West.

== Irish language ==

The Irish language is spoken in the Gaeltacht areas of Counties Mayo and Galway, the largest area being in the west of County Galway. The Galway Gaeltacht is the largest Irish-speaking region in Ireland, taking in Cois Fharraige, parts of Connemara, Conamara Theas, the Aran Islands, Dúithche Sheoigeach (Joyce Country) and the Galway City Gaeltacht. Irish-speaking areas in County Mayo can be found in Iorras, Acaill and Tourmakeady.

According to the 2016 census, Irish is spoken outside of the education system on a daily basis by 9,455 people in the Galway County Gaeltacht areas.

There are 202,667 Irish speakers in the province, over 84,000 in Galway and more than 55,000 in Mayo. There is also the 4,265 attending the 18 Gaelscoileanna (Irish language primary schools) and three Gaelcholáiste (Irish language secondary schools) outside the Gaeltacht across the province. Between 7% and 10% of the province are either native Irish speakers from the Gaeltacht, in Irish medium education or native Irish speakers who no longer live in Gaeltacht areas but still live in the province.

== Sport ==
=== Gaelic games ===
Gaelic football and hurling dominate sport in Connacht with 212 Gaelic Athletic Association affiliated clubs in the province.

Gaelic football is played throughout the province with the five counties annually competing in the Connacht Senior Football Championship to determine the provincial champion. Galway are the most successful side in Connacht with 48 Connacht titles and 9 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Mayo have been the dominant force in the province in recent years winning a five-in-a-row of Connacht titles from 2011 to 2015, and have regularly reached the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. No football team from Connacht has won the All-Ireland since Galway in 2001.

Hurling in Connacht mostly played in County Galway. Galway is the only team in the province to compete in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winning the Liam MacCarthy Cup five times. The Galway hurling team compete in the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship due to the lack of competition in the province.

=== Rugby union ===
Connacht is represented by Connacht Rugby in the United Rugby Championship and the Rugby Champions Cup. Connacht home games are played in the Galway Sportsgrounds in Galway. During the 2015/2016 Season of the Pro12, Connacht, for the first time, reached the play off stages of the competition and won the final in Edinburgh against rivals Leinster. It was their first ever Pro12 title.

Connacht-based teams who have played in the All-Ireland League include Buccaneers RFC, Galway Corinthians RFC, Galwegians RFC, Ballina RFC and Sligo RFC.

=== Other sports ===
Some other sports are overseen by provincial bodies, including in association football, where the Connacht Football Association is the governing body for a number of Connacht league and cup competitions. Traditionally there have been two main senior men&#x27;s teams from the province that compete on a national level, Galway United F.C. and Sligo Rovers F.C. Both clubs have won various domestic honours. 

Cricket is a minor, but growing, sport within the province. The Connacht Cricket Union, founded in 2010, is the governing body for cricket in the province. There are cricket clubs based in Ballaghaderreen, Ballyhaunis, Galway, and Sligo. Connacht does not currently enter a team into the provincial competitions.

<doc id="74201" wikidata="Q41834" url="?curid=74201" title="Romanos IV Diogenes">
<text>Romanos IV Diogenes (; – ) was Byzantine emperor from 1068 to 1071. Determined to halt the decline of the Byzantine military and to stop Turkish incursions into the empire, he is nevertheless best known for his defeat and capture in 1071 at the Battle of Manzikert, which played a major role in undermining Byzantine authority in Anatolia and allowed for its gradual Turkification.

Son of the general Constantine Diogenes and a prominent member of the Cappadocian Greek military aristocracy, Romanos rose to fame as a successful Akritai commander, serving in Syria and on the Danubian frontier. In 1068, he was crowned Byzantine emperor following his marriage to the dowager empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa. Early in his reign, Romanos campaigned with limited success against the Seljuk Turks in Anatolia and Syria. Domestically, his rule was marked by a series of unpopular policies as well as clashes with the rival Doukas family. In 1071, Romanos undertook another major campaign against the Seljuks. His Byzantine army, beset by years of neglect and poor tactics, was decisively defeated by the forces of Alp Arslan at Manzikert. Romanos himself was taken prisoner.

Taking advantage of his capture, members of the Doukas family declared Romanos deposed and proclaimed Michael VII Doukas as emperor in a palace coup. When released, he was ultimately defeated by the Doukai in Cilicia and forced to surrender. Despite receiving a promise that he would be spared, Romanos was blinded and exiled to a monastery on Prote in the Sea of Marmara, where he died of his wounds in 1072.

== Accession to the throne ==

Romanos Diogenes was the son of Constantine Diogenes and a member of a prominent and powerful Byzantine Greek family from Cappadocia, the Diogenai, connected by birth to most of the great aristocratic nobles in Asia Minor. His mother was a daughter of Basil Argyros, brother of the emperor Romanos III. Courageous and generous, but also impetuous, Romanos rose with distinction in the army due to his military talents, and he served in Syria and on the Danubian frontier. At that time some parts from the theme of Bulgaria were organized as a new province with the centre at Serdica, and he became a duke of that province in 1067. However, he was eventually convicted of attempting to usurp the throne of the sons of Constantine X Doukas in 1067. While waiting to receive his sentence from the regent Eudokia Makrembolitissa, he was summoned into her presence and advised that she had pardoned him and that she had furthermore chosen him to be her husband and the guardian of her sons as emperor. She took this course of action primarily due to her concern that unless she managed to find a powerful husband, she could easily lose the regency to any unscrupulous noble, and also because she was infatuated with the popular Romanos. Her decision was met with little protest as the Seljuk Turks had overrun much of Cappadocia and had even taken the important city of Caesarea, meaning that the army needed to be placed under the command of an able and energetic general.

After a written oath promising never to remarry, extracted from Eudokia by Constantine X, had been set aside by the Patriarch of Constantinople, John Xiphilinos, and the approval of the senate obtained, on 1 January 1068 Romanos married the empress and was crowned Emperor of the Romans.

==Physical appearance and personality==
Byzantine Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa was infatuated with Romanos; for according to Attaleiates, “The man not only surpassed others in his good qualities but he was also pleasant to look at in all respects.” He was, however, “very harsh and violent in his judgments,” says Michael the Syrian, and he once ordered the nose of a soldier to be cut off for stealing the donkey of a Muslim after the emperor had given his peace. &quot;One thing alone satisfied him: that he marched against his foes&quot;. He was said to have been very brave, and would often go unarmed and without escort to fight with his enemies which would cause his worried generals to complain. Psellus confirms that Romanus “exposed himself to danger without a thought of the consequences”.
Romanos grew contemptuous of the empress Eudokia for trying to control him.
==Campaigns against the Turks==

Romanos IV was now the senior emperor and guardian of his stepsons and junior co-emperors, Michael VII, Konstantios, and Andronikos Doukas. However, his elevation had antagonised not only the Doukas family, in particular the &quot;Caesar&quot;, John Doukas who led the opposition of the palace officials to Romanos&#x27; authority, but also the Varangian Guard, who openly expressed their discontent at the marriage of Eudokia. Romanos therefore decided that he could only exercise his authority by placing himself at the head of the army in the field, thereby focusing the whole government&#x27;s attention on the war against the Turks.

By 1067, the Turks had been making incursions at will into Mesopotamia, Melitene, Syria, Cilicia, and Cappadocia, culminating with the sack of Caesarea and the plundering of the Church of St Basil. That winter they camped on the frontiers of the empire and waited for the next year&#x27;s campaigning season. Romanos was confident of Byzantine superiority on the field of battle, looking on the Turks as little more than hordes of robbers who would melt away at the first encounter. He did not take into account the degraded state of the Byzantine forces, which had suffered years of neglect from his predecessors, in particular Constantine X Doukas. His forces, mostly composed of Sclavonian, Armenian, Bulgarian, and Frankish mercenaries, were ill-disciplined, disorganised, and uncoordinated, and he was not prepared to spend time in upgrading the arms, armour, or tactics of the once-feared Byzantine army.

===Campaign of 1068===
The first military operations of Romanos did achieve a measure of success, reinforcing his opinions about the outcome of the war. Antioch was exposed to the Saracens of Aleppo who, with help from Turkish troops, began an attempt to reconquer the Byzantine province of Syria. Romanos began marching to the southeastern frontier of the empire to deal with this threat, but as he was advancing towards Lykandos, he received word that a Seljuk army had made an incursion into Pontus and had plundered Neocaesarea. Immediately he selected a small mobile force and quickly raced through Sebaste and the mountains of Tephrike to encounter the Turks on the road, forcing them to abandon their plunder and release their prisoners, though a large number of the Turkish troops managed to escape.

Returning south, Romanos rejoined the main army, and they continued their advance through the passes of Mount Taurus to the north of Germanicia and proceeded to invade the Emirate of Aleppo. Romanos captured Hierapolis, which he fortified to provide protection against further incursions into the south-eastern provinces of the empire. He then engaged in further fighting against the Saracens of Aleppo, but neither side managed a decisive victory. With the campaigning season reaching its end, Romanos returned north via Alexandretta and the Cilician Gates to Podandos. Here he was advised of another Seljuk raid into Asia Minor in which they sacked Amorium but returned to their base so fast that Romanos was in no position to give chase. He eventually reached Constantinople by January 1069.

===Campaign of 1069===

Plans for the following year&#x27;s campaigning were initially thrown into chaos by a rebellion by one of Romanos&#x27; Norman mercenaries, Robert Crispin, who led a contingent of Frankish troops in the pay of the empire. Possibly due to Romanos not paying them on time, they began plundering the countryside near where they were stationed at Edessa, and attacking the imperial tax collectors. Although Crispin was captured and exiled to Abydos, the Franks continued to ravage the Armeniac Theme for some time. In the meantime, the land around Caesarea was again overrun by the Turks, forcing Romanos to spend precious time and energy in expelling the Turks from Cappadocia. Desperate to begin his campaign proper, he ordered the execution of all prisoners, even a Seljuk chieftain who offered to pay an immense ransom for his life. Having brought a measure of peace to the province, Romanos marched towards the Euphrates via Melitene, and crossed the river at Romanopolis, hoping to take Akhlat on Lake Van and thus protect the Armenian frontier.

Romanos placed himself at the head of a substantial body of troops and began his march towards Akhlat, leaving the bulk of the army under the command of Philaretos Brachamios with orders to defend the Mesopotamian frontier. Philaretos was soon defeated by the Turks, whose sack of Iconium forced Romanos to abandon his plans and return to Sebaste. He sent orders to the Dux of Antioch to secure the passes at Mopsuestia, while he attempted to run down the Turks at Heracleia. The Turks were soon hemmed in in the mountains of Cilicia, but they managed to escape to Aleppo after abandoning their plunder. Romanos once again returned to Constantinople without the great victory he was hoping for.

==Affairs at Constantinople==
Romanos was detained at Constantinople in 1070, while he dealt with many outstanding administrative issues, including the imminent fall of Bari into Norman hands. They had been besieging it since 1068, but it had taken Romanos two years to respond. He ordered a relief fleet to set sail, containing sufficient provisions and troops to enable them to hold out for much longer. The fleet was intercepted, however, and defeated by a Norman squadron under the command of Roger, the younger brother of Robert Guiscard, forcing the final remaining outpost of Byzantine authority in Italy to surrender on 15 April 1071.

Meanwhile, Romanos was undertaking a number of unpopular reforms at home. He reduced a great deal of unnecessary public expenditure on court ceremonials and beautifying the capital. He reduced the public salaries paid to much of the court nobility, as well as reducing the profits of tradesmen. His preoccupation with the military had also made him unpopular with the provincial governors and the military hierarchy, as he was determined to ensure they could not abuse their positions, especially through corrupt practices. He incurred the displeasure of the mercenaries by enforcing much needed discipline. Romanos was also deeply unpopular with the common people, as he neglected to entertain them with games at the hippodrome, nor did he alleviate the burdens of the peasants in the provinces.

Nevertheless, he did not forget his principal target, the Turks. Being unable to go on campaign himself, he entrusted the imperial army to one of his generals, Manuel Komnenos, nephew of the former emperor Isaac I, and elder brother to the future emperor Alexios. He managed to engage the Turks in battle, but was defeated and taken prisoner by a Turkish general named Khroudj. Manuel convinced Khroudj to go to Constantinople and see Romanos in person to conclude an alliance, which was soon completed. This act motivated the Seljuk Sultan Alp Arslan to attack the Byzantine Empire, besieging and capturing the important Byzantine fortresses of Manzikert and Archesh. Romanos, in return, offered to officially exchange Manzikert and Archesh for Hieropolis in Syria, which Romanos had taken three years previously.

== Battle of Manzikert and capture by Alp Arslan ==

Early in the spring of 1071, whilst conducting negotiations with Alp Arslan over Manzikert, Romanos marched at the head of a large army with the intent of recovering the fortress. It was soon evident that the army had a serious discipline problem, with soldiers regularly pillaging the area around their nightly camps. When Romanos attempted to enforce some stricter discipline, a whole regiment of German mercenaries mutinied, which the emperor only managed to control with the greatest difficulty. Believing that Alp Arslan was nowhere near Manzikert, he decided to divide his army. One part of the army he dispatched to attack Akhlat, at that time in possession of the Turks. Romanos himself advanced with the main body of the army on Manzikert, which he soon recaptured. At this point his advance guard met the Seljuk army, which was rapidly approaching Manzikert. Romanos ordered the forces attacking Akhlat to rejoin the army, but their portion of the army unexpectedly came across another large Turkish army, so Romanos&#x27; troops retreated toward Mesopotamia. Already understrength, Romanos&#x27; army was further weakened when his Uzes mercenaries deserted to the Turks. Arslan had no desire to take on the Byzantine army, so he proposed a peace treaty with favourable terms for Romanos. 
Michael Attaleiates claims that the Muslim envoy that was sent to Romanos was in reality, only there to stall for more time for the Seljuk army. One Muslim source confirms that the peace mission was a ploy “to discover their [military] condition”.
The emperor, eager for a decisive military victory, rejected the offer, and both armies lined up for a battle, which took place on 26 August 1071. The battle lasted all day without either side gaining any decisive advantage, until the emperor ordered a part of his centre to return to camp. The order was misunderstood by the right wing, however, and Andronikos Doukas, who commanded the reserves, and was the son of &quot;Caesar&quot; John Doukas, took advantage of the confusion to betray Romanos. Claiming that Romanos was dead, he marched away from the battle with some 30,000 men, instead of covering the emperor&#x27;s retreat.

When Romanos discovered what had happened, he tried to recover the situation by making a defiant stand. He fought on valiantly after his horse was killed under him, killing many enemies and causing others to flee, but he received a wound in the hand, which prevented him from wielding a sword, and he was soon taken prisoner.

A number of other sources speak of the valor shown by Romanos at Manzikert: Romanos “launched himself into the thick of the battle. He knocked down several very valiant Persian fighters and caused disarray in their ranks,” according to a contemporary Armenian account. Michael Psellus, who was normally critical, begrudgingly writes, “According to my several informants he actually killed many of them and put others to flight”

According to a number of Byzantine historians, including John Skylitzes, Arslan at first had difficulty believing the dusty and tattered warrior brought before him was the Roman emperor. Romanos and Arslan never expected to meet each other under such circumstances. He then stepped down from his seat and placed his foot on Romanos&#x27; neck. After this sign of ritual humiliation, however, Arslan raised Romanos from the ground and ordered him to be treated like a king. From then on he treated him with extreme kindness, never saying a cruel word to him during the Emperor&#x27;s eight-day stay in his camp. He then released the Emperor in exchange for a treaty and the promise of a hefty ransom. At first Alp Arslan suggested a ransom of 10,000,000 &quot;nomismata&quot; to Romanos IV, but he later reduced it to 1,500,000 &quot;nomismata&quot;, with a further 360,000 &quot;nomismata&quot; annually.

It is reported that upon seeing the Roman emperor, the sultan leapt from his throne like a mad man, commanded Romanos to kiss the ground, and stepped on his neck. He repeatedly berated the emperor, including for spurning his emissaries and offers of peace. The unrepentant Romanos was laconic, and deigned only to offer the curtest responses to his captor&#x27;s fiery upbraiding. He merely had done what was “possible for a man, and which kings are bound to do, and I have fallen short in nothing. But God has fulfilled his will. And now, do what you wish and abandon recriminations.”

Other Muslim sources claim Alp Arslan treated Romanos in a harsh and petty way. “You are too trivial in my view for me to kill you,” the sultan is said to have declared before his Turks in Muslim sources. “Take him to the person who pays most.” When no one reportedly wanted to purchase the “Dog of the Romans,” Alp Arslan scoffed that that was “because the dog is better than he is!” “He struck him three or four blows with his hand and when Romanos collapsed he kicked him a similar number of times”; he “put him in chains and fettered his hand to his neck”; he pulled his hair and put his face to the ground, while informing him, “your troops are food for the Muslims.”

Wanting to test the Roman, Alp Arslan then asked Romanos what he would do to him if he was his prisoner, Romanos frankly answered &quot;the worst!&quot;. The answer impressed Alp Arslan and he said &quot;Ah! by Allah! He has spoken the truth! If he had spoken otherwise, he would be lying. This is an intelligent, tough man. It is not permissible that he should be killed.&quot; After agreeing on a ransom, Alp Arslan then sent emperor Romanos back to Constantinople with a Turkish escort that carried a banner above the disgraced emperor that read: &quot;There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger&quot;.

==Betrayal==
In the meantime, the opposition faction scheming against Romanos IV decided to exploit the situation. Michael VII was proclaimed sole ruler on 1 October 1071, declaring Romanos as deposed. A month later, the &quot;caesar&quot; John Doukas and Michael Psellos forced Eudokia to retire to a monastery. They then refused to honor the agreement made between Arslan and the former emperor. Romanos soon returned, and he and the Doukas family gathered troops. A battle was fought between Constantine, Andronikos Doukas and Romanos. Romanos was defeated and retreated to the fortress of Tyropoion, and from there to Adana in Cilicia. Pursued by Andronikos, he was eventually forced to surrender by the garrison at Adana upon receiving assurances of his personal safety. Before leaving the fortress, he collected all the money he could lay his hands on and sent it to the Sultan as proof of his good faith, along with a message: &quot;As emperor, I promised you a ransom of a million and a half. Dethroned, and about to become dependent upon others, I send you all I possess as proof of my gratitude&quot;.

Andronikos stipulated that his life would be spared if he resigned the purple and retired into a monastery. Romanos agreed, and this agreement was ratified at Constantinople. However, John Doukas reneged on the agreement and sent men to ambush and have Romanos cruelly blinded on 29 June 1072 in Kotyaion. According to Attaleiates, the emperor was led away, pleading for mercy. Per Attaleiates, &quot;when he arose, his eyes were drenched with blood, a pathetic and pitiable sight that made everyone who saw it cry uncontrollably.&quot; He was then sent into exile to Prote in the Sea of Marmara. Without medical assistance, his wound became infected, and he soon endured a painfully lingering death. The final insult was given a few days before his death, when Romanos received a letter from Michael Psellos, congratulating him on the loss of his eyes. He finally died, praying for the forgiveness of his sins, and his widow Eudokia was permitted to honor his remains with a magnificent funeral.

==Family==
By his first wife, Anne, daughter of Alusian of Bulgaria, Romanos IV Diogenes had at least one son:
* Constantine Diogenes, who was married to Theodora, sister of Alexios I Komnenos. This marriage was arranged by Anna Dalassena after the death of Romanos IV, but it was short-lived, as Constantine perished under the walls of Antioch in 1073 while serving with his brother-in-law Isaac Komnenos.

By his second wife, the Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa, he had:
* Leo Diogenes – born in 1069, and according to Anna Comnena was made co-emperor during his father&#x27;s reign. In the reign of Alexius I, he was taken into the imperial palace and given various high commands. He died in Alexius&#x27;s campaigns against the Pechenegs in 1087.
* Nikephoros Diogenes – born in 1069, made Co-emperor upon his birth.

==In popular culture==

A highly fictionalized version of Romanos IV was portrayed by Nikolai Kinski in the 2022 Netflix series &quot;&quot;. The series is mostly set decades before Romanos acceded to the throne.

<doc id="74202" wikidata="Q28507" url="?curid=74202" title="Stork">
<text>Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills. They belong to the family Ciconiidae, and make up the order Ciconiiformes . Ciconiiformes previously included a number of other families, such as herons and ibises, but those families have been moved to other orders. 

Storks dwell in many regions and tend to live in drier habitats than the closely related herons, spoonbills and ibises; they also lack the powder down that those groups use to clean off fish slime. Bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Many species are migratory. Most storks eat frogs, fish, insects, earthworms, small birds and small mammals. There are 20 living species of storks in six genera.

Various terms are used to refer to groups of storks, two frequently used ones being a &quot;muster&quot; of storks and a &quot;phalanx&quot; of storks.

Storks tend to use soaring, gliding flight, which conserves energy. Soaring requires thermal air currents. Ottomar Anschütz&#x27;s famous 1884 album of photographs of storks inspired the design of Otto Lilienthal&#x27;s experimental gliders of the late nineteenth century. Storks are heavy, with wide wingspans: the marabou stork, with a wingspan of and weight up to , joins the Andean condor in having the widest wingspan of all living land birds.

Their nests are often very large and may be used for many years. Some nests have been known to grow to over in diameter and about in depth. All storks were once thought to be monogamous, but this is only partially true. While storks are generally socially monogamous, some species exhibit regular extra-pair breeding.

Popular conceptions of storks&#x27; fidelity, serial monogamy, and doting parental care contribute to their prominence in mythology and culture, especially in western folklore as the deliverers of newborn humans.

All 20 stork species have been assessed by the IUCN and carry a confident Red List status. However, the assessment for several species were based on incorrect assumptions and a general absence of sound information on stork habits.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;stork&quot; was first used in its current sense by at least the 12th century in Middle English. It is derived from the Old English word &quot;storc&quot;, which itself comes from the hypothesised Proto-Germanic and ultimately the Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot;. The name refers to the rigid posture of storks, a meaning reflected in the related word , which is derived from the Old English &quot;stearc&quot;. Several species of storks are known by other common names. The jabiru is named after the Tupí-Guarani words meaning &quot;that which has&quot; and &quot;swollen&quot;, referring to its thickset neck. The marabou stork is named after the Arabic word for holy man, &quot;murābiṭ&quot;, due to the perceived holy nature of the species. The adjutants are named after the military rank, referring to their stiff, military-like gait.

==Systematics==

A DNA study found that the families Ardeidae, Balaenicipitidae, Scopidae and the Threskiornithidae belong to the Pelecaniformes. This would make Ciconiidae the only group.

Storks were distinct and possibly widespread by the Oligocene. Like most families of aquatic birds, storks seem to have arisen in the Palaeogene, maybe 40–50 million years ago (mya). For the fossil record of living genera, documented since the Middle Miocene (about 15 mya) at least in some cases, see the genus articles.

No species or subspecies of stork is known to have gone extinct in historic times. A systematic literature review uncovered nearly 1,000 papers on storks, but showed most stork species to lack scientific understanding suggesting that many species should be classified as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List. A &quot;Ciconia&quot; bone found in a rock shelter on the island of Réunion was probably of a bird taken there as food by early settlers; no known account mentions the presence of storks on the Mascarene Islands.

=== Phylogeny ===
The following phylogeny is recognized by the International Ornithological Congress, partially based on de Sousa &quot;et al&quot; (2023):
===Fossil storks===
*Genus &quot;Palaeoephippiorhynchus&quot; (fossil: Early Oligocene of Fayyum, Egypt)
*Genus &quot;Grallavis&quot; (fossil: Early Miocene of Saint-Gérand-le-Puy, France, and Djebel Zelten, Libya) – may be same as &quot;Prociconia&quot;
*Ciconiidae gen. et sp. indet. (Ituzaingó Late Miocene of Paraná, Argentina)
*Ciconiidae gen. et sp. indet. (Puerto Madryn Late Miocene of Punta Buenos Aires, Argentina)
*Genus &quot;Prociconia&quot; (fossil: Late Pleistocene of Brazil) – may belong to modern genus &quot;Jabiru&quot; or &quot;Ciconia&quot;
*Genus &quot;Pelargosteon&quot; (fossil: Early Pleistocene of Romania)
*Ciconiidae gen. et sp. indet. – formerly &quot;Aquilavus/Cygnus bilinicus&quot; (fossil: Early Miocene of Břešťany, Czech Republic)
*cf. &quot;Leptoptilos&quot; gen. et sp. indet. – formerly &quot;L. siwalicensis&quot; (fossil: Late Miocene? – Late Pliocene of Siwalik, India)
*Ciconiidae gen. et sp. indet. (fossil: Late Pleistocene of San Josecito Cavern, Mexico)
*&quot;Ciconia nana&quot; (fossil: Pleistocene of Darling Downs, Queensland, Australia, and &quot;Ciconia louisebolesae&quot; fossil: Olig-Miocene of Riversleigh WHA, Queensland, Australia

The fossil genera &quot;Eociconia&quot; (Middle Eocene of China) and &quot;Ciconiopsis&quot; (Deseado Early Oligocene of Patagonia, Argentina) are often tentatively placed with this family. A &quot;ciconiiform&quot; fossil fragment from the Touro Passo Formation found at Arroio Touro Passo (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) might be of the living wood stork &quot;M. americana&quot;; it is at most of Late Pleistocene age, a few 10,000s of years.

==Morphology==

Storks range in size from the marabou, which stands tall and can weigh , to the Abdim&#x27;s stork, which is only high and weighs only . Their shape is superficially similar to the herons, with long legs and necks, but they are more heavy-set. There is some sexual dimorphism (differences between males and females) in size, with males being up to 15% bigger than females in some species (for example the saddle-billed stork), but almost no difference in appearance. The only difference is in the colour of the iris of the two species in the genus &quot;Ephippiorhynchus&quot;.

The bills of storks are large to very large, and vary considerably between the genera. The shape of the bills is linked to the diet of the different species. The large bills of the &quot;Ciconia&quot; storks are the least specialized. Larger are the massive and slightly upturned bills of the &quot;Ephippiorhynchus&quot; and the jabiru. These have evolved to hunt for fish in shallow water. Larger still are the massive daggers of the two adjutants and marabou (&quot;Leptoptilos&quot;), which are used to feed on carrion and in defense against other scavengers, as well as for taking other prey. The long, ibis-like downcurved bills of the &quot;Mycteria&quot; storks have sensitive tips that allow them to detect prey by touch (tactilocation) where cloudy conditions would not allow them to see it. The most specialised bills of any storks are those of the two openbills (&quot;Anastomus&quot;), which as their name suggests, is open in the middle when their bill is closed. These bills have evolved to help openbills feed on their primary prey item, aquatic snails.

Although it is sometimes reported that storks lack syrinxes and are mute, they do have syrinxes, and are capable of making some sounds, although they do not do so often. The syrinxes of storks are &quot;variably degenerate&quot; however, and the syringeal membranes of some species are found between tracheal rings or cartilage, an unusual arrangement shared with the ovenbirds.

==Distribution and habitat==

Storks have a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, being absent from the poles, most of North America and large parts of Australia. The centres of stork diversity are in tropical Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with eight and six breeding species respectively. Just three species are present in the New World: wood stork, maguari stork and jabiru, which is the tallest flying bird of the Americas. Two species, white and black stork, reach Europe and western temperate Asia, while one species, Oriental stork, reaches temperate areas of eastern Asia, and one species, black-necked stork, is found in Australasia.

Storks are more diverse and common in the tropics, and the species that live in temperate climates for the most part migrate to avoid the worst of winter. They are fairly diverse in their habitat requirements. Some species, particularly the &quot;Mycteria &quot; &quot;wood storks&quot; and &quot;Anastomus&quot; openbills, are highly dependent on water and aquatic prey, but many other species are far less dependent on this habitat type, although they will frequently make use of it. Species like the marabou and Abdim&#x27;s stork will frequently be found foraging in open grasslands of savannah. Preferred habitats include flooded grasslands, light woodland, marshes and paddyfields, wet meadows, river backwaters and ponds. Many species will select shallow pools, particularly when lakes or rivers are drying out, as they concentrate prey and make it harder for prey to escape, or when monsoonal rainfall increases water depth of larger waterbodies. Some species like the woolly-necked storks and lesser adjutant storks have adapted to changing crops of tropical agricultural landscapes that enables them to remain resident despite the transformations brought about by seasonal crops. In South Africa, the woolly-necked storks have adapted to artificial feeding and now largely nest on trees in gardens with swimming pools.

Less typical habitats include the dense temperate forests used by European black storks, or the rainforest habitat sought by Storm&#x27;s stork in South East Asia. They generally avoid marine habitats, with the exception of the lesser adjutant, milky stork and wood stork, all of which forage in mangroves, lagoons and estuarine mudflats. A number of species, especially woolly-necked storks, black-necked storks, Asian openbills and lesser adjutant Storks in south Asia, have adapted to highly modified human habitats, for foraging and breeding. In the absence of persecution several stork species breed close to people, and species such as the marabou, greater adjutant, and white stork feed at landfill sites.

===Migration and movements===

Storks vary in their tendency towards migration. Temperate species like the white stork, black stork and Oriental stork undertake long annual migrations in the winter. The routes taken by these species have developed to avoid long distance travel across water, and from Europe this usually means flying across the Straits of Gibraltar or east across the Bosphorus and through Israel and the Sinai. Studies of young birds denied the chance to travel with others of their species have shown that these routes are at least partially learnt, rather than being innate as they are in passerine migrants. Migrating black storks are split between those that make stopovers on the migration between Europe and their wintering grounds in Africa, and those that do not.

The Abdim&#x27;s stork is another migrant, albeit one that migrates within the tropics. It breeds in northern Africa, from Senegal to the Red Sea, during the wet season, and then migrates to Southern Africa. Many species that are not regular migrants will still make smaller movements if circumstances require it; others may migrate over part of their range. This can also include regular commutes from nesting sites to feeding areas. Wood storks have been observed feeding from their breeding colony.

==Behaviour==
===Feeding and diet===

Storks are carnivorous predators, taking a range of reptiles, small mammals, insects, fish, amphibians and other small invertebrates. Storks usually hunt for animals in shallow water. Any plant material consumed is usually by accident. &quot;Mycteria&quot; storks are specialists in feeding on aquatic vertebrates, particularly when prey is concentrated by lowering water levels or flooding into shallows. On marine mudflats and mangrove swamps in Sumatra, milky storks feed on mudskippers, probing the burrow with the bill and even the whole head into the mud. The characteristic feeding method involves standing or walking in shallow water and holding the bill submerged in the water. When contact is made with prey the bill reflexively snaps shut in 25 milliseconds, one of the fastest reactions known in any vertebrate. The reaction is able to distinguish between prey items and inanimate objects like branches, although the exact mechanism is unknown.

Openbills are specialists in freshwater molluscs, particularly apple snails. They feed in small groups, and sometimes African openbills ride on the backs of hippos while foraging. Having caught a snail it will return to land or at least to the shallows to eat it. The fine tip of the bill of the openbills is used to open the snail, and the saliva has a narcotic effect, which causes the snail to relax and simplifies the process of extraction.

The other genera of storks are more generalised. &quot;Ciconia&quot; storks are very generalised in their diets, and some species including Abdim&#x27;s stork and marabous will feed in large flocks on swarms of locusts and at wildfires. This is why white storks and Abdim&#x27;s storks are known as &quot;grasshopper birds&quot;. &quot;Ephippiorhynchus&quot; are carnivorous though have a very diverse diet when living on human modified habitats such as agricultural landscapes. The foraging method used by the generalists is to stalk or walk across grassland or shallow water, watching for prey.

===Breeding===

Storks range from being solitary breeders through loose breeding associations to fully colonial. The jabiru, &quot;Ephippiorhynchus&quot; storks and several species of &quot;Ciconia&quot; are entirely solitary when breeding. In contrast the &quot;Mycteria&quot; storks, Abdim&#x27;s stork, openbills and &quot;Leptoptilos&quot; storks breed in colonies which can range from a couple of pairs to thousands. Many of these species breed in colonies with other waterbirds, which can include other species of storks, herons and egrets, pelicans, cormorants and ibises. White storks, Oriental storks and Maguari storks are all loosely colonial, and may breed in nests that are within visual range of others of the same species, but have little to do with one another. They also may nest solitarily, and the reasons why they choose to nest together or apart are not understood. Storks use trees in a variety of habitats to breed including forests, cities, farmlands, and large wetlands. 

== In culture ==

Many ancient mythologies feature stories and legends involving storks. In Ancient Egypt, saddle-billed storks were seen as being amongst the most powerful animals and were used to represent the &quot;ba&quot;, the Ancient Egyptian conception of the soul, during the Old Kingdom. Bennu, an Egyptian deity that was later the inspiration for the phoenix, may also have been inspired by a stork, although it was more likely an ibis or heron.

Greek and Roman mythology portrays storks as models of parental devotion. The 3rd century Roman writer Aelian, citing the authority of Alexander of Myndus, noted in his &quot;De natura animalium&quot; (book 3, chapter 23) that aged storks flew away to oceanic islands where they were transformed into humans as a reward for their piety towards their parents. Storks were also thought to care for their aged parents, feeding them and even transporting them, and children&#x27;s books depicted them as a model of filial values. A Greek law called &quot;Pelargonia&quot;, from the Ancient Greek word &quot;pelargos&quot; for stork, required citizens to take care of their aged parents. The Greeks also held that killing a stork could be punished with death.

Storks feature in several of Aesop&#x27;s Fables, most notably in The Farmer and the Stork, The Fox and the Stork, and The Frogs Who Desired a King. The first fable involves a stork who is caught with a group of cranes who are eating grain in a farmer&#x27;s field, with the moral that those who associate with wicked people can be held accountable for their crimes. The Fox and the Stork involves a fox who invites a stork for dinner and provides soup in a dish that the stork cannot drink from, and is in turn invited for dinner by the stork and given food in a narrow jug which he cannot access. It cautions readers to follow the principle of do no harm. The third fable involves a group of frogs that are dissatisfied with the king that Zeus has given them, an inanimate log, and who are then punished with a new (a water-snake in some versions) who eats the frogs. &quot;King Stork&quot; has subsequently entered the English language as a term for a particularly tyrannical ruler.

=== Associations with fertility ===
According to European folklore, the white stork is responsible for bringing babies to new parents. The legend is very ancient, but was popularised by an 1839 Hans Christian Andersen story called &quot;The Storks&quot;. German folklore held that storks found babies in caves or marshes and brought them to households in a basket on their backs or held in their beaks. These caves contained &quot;adebarsteine&quot; or &quot;stork stones&quot;. The babies would then be given to the mother or dropped down the chimney. Households would notify when they wanted children by placing sweets for the stork on the window sill. Subsequently, the folklore has spread around the world to the Philippines and countries in South America. Birthmarks on the back of the head of newborn babies, &quot;nevus flammeus nuchae&quot;, are sometimes referred to as stork-bite. In Slavic mythology and pagan religion, storks were thought to carry unborn souls from Vyraj to Earth in spring and summer. This belief still persists in the modern folk culture of many Slavic countries, in the simplified child story that &quot;storks bring children into the world&quot;.

Famous is the role that the fable played in historical development of psychoanalysis: the name ‘chimney sweeping’, which the first of all patients gave to her talking cure, is a free association with the place through which the bird used to bring babies into house. Psychoanalyst Marvin Margolis suggests the enduring nature of the stork fable of the newborn is linked to its addressing a psychological need, in that it allays the discomfort of discussing sex and procreation with children. Birds have long been associated with the maternal symbols from pagan goddesses such as Juno, to the Holy Ghost, and the stork may have been chosen for its white plumage (depicting purity), size, and flight at high altitude (likened to flying between Earth and Heaven).

There were negative aspects to stork folklore as well; a Polish folktale relates how God made the stork&#x27;s plumage white, while the Devil gave it black wings, imbuing it with both good and evil impulses. They were also associated with handicapped or stillborn babies in Germany, explained as the stork having dropped the baby en route to the household, or as revenge or punishment for past wrongdoing. A mother who was confined to bed around the time of childbirth was said to have been &quot;bitten&quot; by the stork. In Denmark, storks were said to toss a nestling off the nest and then an egg in successive years. In medieval England, storks were also associated with adultery, possibly inspired by their courtship rituals. Their preening and posture saw them linked with the attribute of self-conceit. Children of African American slaves were sometimes told that white babies were brought by storks, while black babies were born from buzzard eggs.

=== As food ===
Storks have never been a particularly common food, but occasionally featured in medieval banquets. They may also have been eaten in Ancient Egypt.

<text>Leinster ( ; or ) is one of the four provinces of Ireland, in the southeast of Ireland. 

The modern province comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Meath, Leinster and Osraige, which existed during Gaelic Ireland. Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, the historic &quot;fifths&quot; of Leinster and Meath gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster. The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes. In later centuries, local government legislation has prompted further sub-division of the historic counties.

Leinster has no official function for local-government purposes. However, it is an officially recognised subdivision of Ireland and is listed on ISO 3166-2 as one of the four provinces of Ireland. &quot;IE-L&quot; is attributed to Leinster as its &quot;country sub-division&quot; code. Leinster had a population of 2,858,501 according to the preliminary results of the 2022 census, making it the most populous province in the country. The traditional flag of Leinster features a golden harp on a green background.

==History==
===Early history===
The Gaelic Kingdom of Leinster before 1171, considerably smaller than the present-day province, usually did not include certain territories such as Meath, or the Viking cities of Wexford and Dublin.

The first part of the name &quot;Leinster&quot; derives from , the name of a major tribe that once inhabited the area. The latter part of the name derives either from the Irish or from the Old Norse , both of which translate as &#x27;land&#x27; or &#x27;territory&#x27;.

 (Hugony the Great), who supposedly built the hill fort of , near Kilcullen in County Kildare, united the tribes of Leinster. He is a likely, but uncertain, candidate as the first historical king of Laigin (Leinster) in the 7th century BC. Circa 175/185 AD, following a period of civil wars in Ireland, the legendary re-founded the kingdom of Laigin. The legendary Finn Mac Cool, or , reputedly built a stronghold at the Hill of Allen, on the edge of the Bog of Allen.

In the 4th and 5th centuries AD, after Magnus Maximus had left Britain in 383 AD with his legions, leaving a power vacuum, colonists from Laigin settled in North Wales, specifically in Anglesey, Carnarvonshire and Denbighshire. In Wales some of the Leinster-Irish colonists left their name on the Llŷn Peninsula (in Gwynedd), which derives its name from .

In the 5th century, the emerging dynasties from Connacht conquered areas of Westmeath, Meath and Offaly from the and of the Laigin. attempted to exact the (cattle-tribute) from the Laigin from that time, in the process becoming their traditional enemies.

By the 8th century the rulers of Laigin had split into two dynasties:
* Northern Leinster dynasty: (d. 727), King of , and joint leader of the Laigin
* Southern Leinster dynasty: (d. 738), King of , and joint leader of the Laigin

After the death of the last Kildare-based King of Laigin, in 1042, the kingship of Leinster reverted to the sept based in the southeast in present-day County Wexford. This southern dynasty provided all the later Kings of Leinster.

===Kingdom of Ireland period===
Leinster includes the extended &quot;English Pale&quot;, counties controlled directly from Dublin, at the beginning of the 1600s. The other three provinces had their own regional &quot;Presidency&quot; systems, based on a Welsh model of administration, in theory if not in fact, from the 1570s and 1580s up to the 1670s, and were considered separate entities. Gradually &quot;Leinster&quot; subsumed the term &quot;The Pale&quot;, as the kingdom was pacified and the difference between the old Pale area and the wider province, now also under English administration, grew less distinct.

The expansion of the province took in the territory of the ancient Kingdom of Mide encompassing much of present-day counties Meath, Westmeath and Longford with five west County Offaly baronies. Local lordships were incorporated during the Tudor conquest of Ireland and subsequent plantation schemes.

Other boundary changes included County Louth, officially removed from Ulster in 1596, the baronies of Ballybritt and Clonlisk (formerly Éile Uí Chearbhaill in the county palatine of Tipperary) in Munster becoming part of Leinster in 1606, and the &#x27;Lands of Ballymascanlon&#x27; transferred from Armagh to Louth . The provincial borders were redrawn by Cromwell for administration and military reasons, and the Offaly parishes of Annally and Lusmagh, formerly part of Connacht, were transferred in 1660.

The last major boundary changes within Leinster occurred with the formation of County Wicklow (1603–1606), from lands in the north of Carlow (which previously extended to the sea) and most of southern Dublin. Later minor changes dealt with &quot;islands&quot; of one county in another. By the late 1700s, Leinster looked as shown in the above map of 1784.

==Geography and subdivisions==
===Counties===

The province is divided into twelve traditional counties: Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Longford, Louth, Meath, Offaly, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow. Leinster has the most counties of any province, but is the second smallest of the four Irish provinces by land area. With a population of 2,870,354 as of 2022, it is the island&#x27;s most populous province. Dublin is the only official city in the province, and is by far its largest settlement.

===Large settlements===
As of the 2016 census, the larger settlements in Leinster included:
==Culture==
===Language===
As is the norm for language in Ireland, English is the primary spoken language, but there is an active Irish-speaking minority in the province. According to the Census of Ireland of 2011, there were 18,947 daily speakers of Irish in Leinster outside the education system, including 1,299 native speakers in the small Gaeltacht of Ráth Chairn. As of 2011, there were 19,348 students attending the 66 Gaelscoils (Irish-language primary schools) and 15 Gaelcholáistí (Irish-language secondary schools) in the province, primarily in the Dublin area.

===Sport===
A number of sporting and cultural organisations organise themselves on provincial lines, including Leinster Rugby, the Leinster Cricket Union, Leinster Hockey Association and Leinster GAA. While Leinster GAA is made up primarily of the traditional counties of the province, GAA teams from Galway, Kerry and Antrim have played in the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship, as has a team from London; Galway won the title in 2012. Participation of these counties is based on their performances in the Christy Ring Cup.

<doc id="74204" wikidata="Q83931" url="?curid=74204" title="Locust">
<text>Locusts (derived from the Latin &quot;locusta&quot;, locust or lobster) are various species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae that have a swarming phase. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances they become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious. No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions; this has evolved independently in multiple lineages, comprising at least 18 genera in 5 different subfamilies.

Normally, these grasshoppers are innocuous, their numbers are low, and they do not pose a major economic threat to agriculture. However, under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains triggers dramatic changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic (loosely described as migratory) when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless nymphs that later become swarms of winged adults. Both the bands and the swarms move around, rapidly strip fields, and damage crops. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.

Locusts have formed plagues since prehistory. The ancient Egyptians carved them on their tombs and the insects are mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the Mahabharata, the Bible and Quran. Swarms have devastated crops and have caused famines and human migrations. More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of locust breeding grounds have allowed control measures at an early stage. Traditional locust control uses insecticides from the ground or air, but newer biological control methods are proving effective. Swarming behaviour decreased in the 20th century, but despite modern surveillance and control methods, swarms can still form; when suitable weather conditions occur and vigilance lapses, plagues can occur.

Locusts are large insects and convenient for research and classroom study of zoology. They are edible by humans. They have been eaten throughout history and are considered a delicacy in many countries.

== Swarming grasshoppers ==

Locusts are the swarming phase of certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious.

No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions. In English, the term &quot;locust&quot; is used for grasshopper species that change morphologically and behaviourally on crowding, forming swarms that develop from bands of immature stages called hoppers. The change is described as density-dependent phenotypic plasticity.

These changes are examples of phase polyphenism; they were first analysed and described by Boris Uvarov, who was instrumental in setting up the Anti-Locust Research Centre. He made his discoveries during his studies of the migratory locust in the Caucasus, whose solitary and gregarious phases had previously been thought to be separate species (&quot;Locusta migratoria&quot; and &quot;L. danica&quot; L.). He designated the two phases as &quot;solitaria&quot; and &quot;gregaria&quot;. These are called statary and migratory morphs, though strictly speaking, their swarms are nomadic rather than migratory. Charles Valentine Riley and Norman Criddle were involved in achieving the understanding and control of locusts.

Swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.

The formation of initial bands of gregarious hoppers is called an &quot;outbreak&quot;; when these join into larger groups, the event is known as an &quot;upsurge&quot;. Continuing agglomerations of upsurges on a regional level originating from a number of entirely separate breeding locations are known as &quot;plagues&quot;. During outbreaks and the early stages of upsurges, only part of the locust population becomes gregarious, with scattered bands of hoppers spread out over a large area. As time goes by, the insects become more cohesive and the bands become concentrated in a smaller area. In the desert locust plague in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia that lasted from 1966 to 1969, the number of locusts increased from two to 30 billion over two generations, but the area covered decreased from over to .

=== Solitary and gregarious phases ===

One of the greatest differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The &quot;gregaria&quot; nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen as early as the second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way around barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects involves visual and olfactory cues. The bands seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before continuing on, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.

Locusts in the gregarious phase differ in morphology and development. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the &quot;gregaria&quot; nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have a longer nymphal period; the adults are larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates; they mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have lower levels of fecundity.

The mutual attraction between individual insects continues into adulthood, and they continue to act as a cohesive group. Individuals that get detached from a swarm fly back into the mass. Others that get left behind after feeding take off to rejoin the swarm when it passes overhead. When individuals at the front of the swarm settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole swarm acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts spend much time on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where transitory rainfall has caused a green flush of new growth.

==Distribution and diversity==

Several species of grasshoppers swarm as locusts in different parts of the world, on all continents except Antarctica: For example, the Australian plague locust (&quot;Chortoicetes terminifera&quot;) swarms across Australia.

The desert locust (&quot;Schistocerca gregaria&quot;) is probably the best known species owing to its wide distribution (North Africa, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent) and its ability to migrate over long distances. A major infestation covered much of western Africa from 2003 to 2005, after unusually heavy rain set up favourable ecological conditions for swarming. The first outbreaks occurred in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Sudan in 2003. The rain allowed swarms to develop and move north to Morocco and Algeria, threatening croplands. Swarms crossed Africa, appearing in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, the first time in those countries for 50 years. The cost of handling the infestation was put at US$122 million, and the damage to crops at up to $2.5 billion.

The migratory locust (&quot;Locusta migratoria&quot;), sometimes classified into up to 10 subspecies, swarms in Africa, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, but has become rare in Europe. In 2013, the Madagascan form of the migratory locust formed many swarms of over a billion insects, reaching &quot;plague&quot; status and covering about half the country by March 2013. 
Species such as the Senegalese grasshopper (&quot;Oedaleus senegalensis&quot;) and the African rice grasshopper (&quot;Hieroglyphus daganensis&quot;), both from the Sahel, often display locust-like behaviour and change morphologically on crowding.

North America is the only sub-continent besides Antarctica without a native locust species. The Rocky Mountain locust was formerly one of the most significant insect pests there, but it became extinct in 1902. In the 1930s, during the Dust Bowl, a second species of North American locust, the High Plains locust (&quot;Dissosteira longipennis&quot;), reached plague proportions in the American Midwest. Today, the High Plains locust is a rare species, leaving North America with no regularly swarming locusts.

=== Evolution ===
The fossilized wing of an indeterminate locust has been found in Early Oligocene-aged sediments of the Pabdeh Formation in Iran, which were deposited in a deep marine environment. The locust was likely migrating across the early Paratethys Sea, between the emergent Arabian Peninsula and central Iran, which were still separated by large areas of deep ocean at this time. This suggests that trans-oceanic locust migrations have been occurring for at least 30 million years, likely facilitated by the spread of grasslands at the time.

==Interaction with humans and animals==

===Ancient times===

Study of literature shows how pervasive plagues of locusts were over the course of history. The insects arrived unexpectedly, often after a change of wind direction or weather, and the consequences were devastating. The Ancient Egyptians carved locusts on tombs in the period 2470 to 2220 BC. A devastating plague in Egypt is mentioned in the Book of Exodus in the Bible. Locust plague is mentioned in the Indian &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The &quot;Iliad&quot; mentions locusts taking to the wing to escape fire. Plagues of locusts are mentioned in the Quran. In the ninth century BC, the Chinese authorities appointed anti-locust officers. In the New Testament, John the Baptist was said to survive in the wilderness on locusts and wild honey; and human-headed locusts appear in the Book of Revelation.

Aristotle studied locusts and their breeding habits and Livy recorded a devastating plague in Capua in 203 BC. He mentioned human epidemics following locust plagues which he associated with the stench from the putrifying corpses; the linking of human disease outbreaks to locust plagues was widespread. A pestilence in the northwestern provinces of China in 311 AD that killed 98% of the population locally was blamed on locusts, and may have been caused by an increase in numbers of rats (and their fleas) that devoured the locust carcasses.

=== Recent times ===

During the last two millennia, desert locust plagues have appeared sporadically in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Other species of locusts caused havoc in North and South America, Asia, and Australasia; in China, 173 outbreaks over 1924 years. The Bombay locust (&quot;Nomadacris succincta&quot;) was a major pest in India and southeastern Asia in the 18th and 19th centuries, but has seldom swarmed since the last plague in 1908.

In the spring of 1747 locusts arrived outside Damascus eating the majority of the crops and vegetation of the surrounding countryside. One local barber, Ahmad al-Budayri, recalled the locusts &quot;came like a black cloud. They covered everything: the trees and the crops. May God Almighty save us!&quot;

The extinction of the Rocky Mountain locust has been a source of puzzlement. It had swarmed throughout the west of the United States and parts of Canada in the 19th century. Albert&#x27;s swarm of 1875 was estimated to contain 12.5 trillion insects covering an area of (larger than the state of California) and to weigh 27.5 million tons. The last specimen was seen alive in Canada in 1902. Recent research suggests the breeding grounds of this insect in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains came under sustained agricultural development during the large influx of gold miners, destroying the underground eggs of the locust.

The 1915 infestation across Palestine and Syria was one of the main contributors to famine in Lebanon which lasted from 1915 to 1918 during which around 200,000 people died. Plagues became less common in the 20th century, but they continue to occur when the conditions are met.

=== Monitoring ===

Early intervention to prevent large locust swarms is more successful than later action once swarms have built up. The means to control locust populations is now available, but organisational, financial, and political problems may be difficult to overcome. Monitoring is the key to early detection and eradication. Ideally, a sufficient proportion of nomadic bands can be killed with insecticide before their swarming phase. This may be possible in richer countries like Morocco and Saudi Arabia, but neighbouring poorer countries such as Mauritania and Yemen lack the resources and may breed locust swarms that threaten the whole region.

Several organisations around the world monitor the threat from locusts. They provide forecasts detailing regions likely to suffer from locust plagues in the near future. In Australia, this service is provided by the Australian Plague Locust Commission. It has been very successful in dealing with developing outbreaks, but has the great advantage of having a defined area to monitor and defend without locust invasions from elsewhere. In Central and Southern Africa, the service is provided by the International Locust Control Organization for Central and Southern Africa. In West and Northwest Africa, the service is co-ordinated by the Food and Agriculture Organization&#x27;s Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust in the Western Region, and executed by locust control agencies belonging to each country concerned. The FAO monitors the situation in the Caucasus and Central Asia, where over 25 million hectares of cultivated land are under threat. In February 2020, in an effort to end massive locust outbreaks, India decided to use drones and special equipment to monitor locusts and spray insecticides.

=== Control ===

Historically, people could do little to protect their crops from locusts, although eating the insects may have been some compensation. By the early 20th century, efforts were made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its accumulation in the food chain.

In years when locust control is needed, the hoppers are targeted early by applying water-based contact pesticides from tractor-based sprayers. This is effective but slow and labour-intensive; a preferable method is spraying concentrated insecticide from aircraft over the insects or vegetation. The use of ultralow-volume spraying of contact pesticides from aircraft in overlapping swathes is effective against nomadic bands and can be used to treat large areas of land swiftly. Other modern technologies for planning locust control include GPS, GIS tools, and satellite imagery with rapid computer data management and analysis.

A biological pesticide to control locusts was tested across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a &quot;Metarhizium acridum&quot; sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death. The fungus is passed from insect to insect and persists in the area, making repeated treatments unnecessary. This approach to locust control was used in Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts. The outbreak was contained without harm to the local elephants, hippopotamuses, and giraffes.

=== As experimental models ===

The locust is large and easy to breed and rear, and is used as an experimental model in research studies. It has been used in evolutionary biology research and to test the generalizability of conclusions reached about test organisms such as the fruit fly (&quot;Drosophila&quot;) and the housefly (&quot;Musca&quot;). It is a suitable school laboratory animal because of its robustness and ease of breeding and handling.

At Tel Aviv University, scientists have been using the antennae&#x27;s acute sensitivity of Sense of smell to detect different odors in various technologies.

=== As food ===

Locusts have been used as food throughout history. They are considered meat. Several cultures throughout the world consume insects, and locusts are considered a delicacy in many African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries.

They can be cooked in many ways, but are often fried, smoked, or dried.
The Bible records that John the Baptist ate locusts and wild honey () while living in the wilderness. Attempts have been made to explain the text to mean ascetic vegetarian food such as carob beans, but the plain meaning of the Greek &quot;akrides&quot; is locust.

The Torah prohibits the use of most insects as food, but it permits consuming certain types of locust; specifically, those that are red, yellow, or spotted grey. Islamic jurisprudence deems eating locusts to be halal. The Prophet Muhammad was reported to have eaten locusts during a military raid with his companions.

Locusts are eaten in the Arabian Peninsula, including Saudi Arabia. In 2014, consumption of locusts spiked around Ramadan especially in the Al-Qassim Region, since many Saudis believe they are healthy to eat, but the Saudi Ministry of Health warned that pesticides made them unsafe. Yemenis also consume locusts, and expressed discontent over governmental plans to use pesticides against them. ʻAbd al-Salâm Shabînî described a locust recipe from Morocco. 19th century European travellers observed Arabs in Arabia, Egypt, and Morocco selling, cooking, and eating locusts. They reported that in Egypt and Palestine locusts were consumed, and that in Palestine, around the River Jordan, in Egypt, in Arabia, and in Morocco that Arabs ate locusts, while Syrian peasants did not eat locusts.

In the Haouran region, Fellahs who were in poverty and suffered from famine ate locusts after removing the guts and head, while locusts were swallowed whole by Bedouins. Syrians, Copts, Greeks, Armenians, and other Christians and Arabs themselves reported that in Arabia locusts were eaten frequently and one Arab described to a European traveler the different types of locusts which were favored as food by Arabs. Persians use the Anti-Arab racial slur &quot;Arabe malakh-khor&quot; (, literally &quot;locust eater Arab&quot;) against Arabs.

Locusts yield about five times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of greenhouse gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7 kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10 kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13 and 28 g / 100 g for adult locust, 14–18 g / 100 g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g / 100 g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286 mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic, and linolenic acids were found to be the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.

<text>John II Komnenos or Comnenus (; 13 September 1087 – 8 April 1143) was Byzantine emperor from 1118 to 1143. Also known as &quot;John the Beautiful&quot; or &quot;John the Good&quot; (), he was the eldest son of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos and Irene Doukaina and the second emperor to rule during the Komnenian restoration of the Byzantine Empire. As he was born to a reigning emperor, he had the status of a . John was a pious and dedicated monarch who was determined to undo the damage his empire had suffered following the Battle of Manzikert, half a century earlier.

John has been assessed as the greatest of the Komnenian emperors. This view became entrenched due to its espousal by George Ostrogorsky in his influential book &quot;History of the Byzantine State&quot;, where John is described as a ruler who, &quot;... combined clever prudence with purposeful energy ... and [was] high principled beyond his day.&quot; In the course of the quarter-century of his reign, John made alliances with the Holy Roman Empire in the west, decisively defeated the Pechenegs, Hungarians and Serbs in the Balkans, and personally led numerous campaigns against the Turks in Asia Minor. John&#x27;s campaigns fundamentally changed the balance of power in the east, forcing the Turks onto the defensive; they also led to the recapture of many towns, fortresses and cities across the Anatolian peninsula. In the southeast, John extended Byzantine control from the Maeander in the west all the way to Cilicia and Tarsus in the east. In an effort to demonstrate the Byzantine ideal of the emperor&#x27;s role as the leader of the Christian world, John marched into Muslim Syria at the head of the combined forces of Byzantium and the Crusader states; yet despite the great vigour with which he pressed the campaign, John&#x27;s hopes were disappointed by the evasiveness of his Crusader allies and their reluctance to fight alongside his forces.

Under John, the empire&#x27;s population recovered to about 10 million people. The quarter-century of John II&#x27;s reign is less well recorded by contemporary or near-contemporary writers than the reigns of either his father, Alexios I, or his son, Manuel I. In particular little is known of the history of John&#x27;s domestic rule or policies.

==Physical appearance and character==

The Latin historian William of Tyre described John as short and unusually ugly, with eyes, hair and complexion so dark he was known as &#x27;the Moor&#x27;. Yet despite his physical appearance, John was known as &quot;Kaloïōannēs&quot;, &quot;John the Good&quot; or &quot;John the Beautiful&quot;; the epithet referred to his character. Both his parents were unusually pious and John surpassed them. Members of his court were expected to restrict their conversation to serious subjects only. The food served at the emperor&#x27;s table was very frugal and John lectured courtiers who lived in excessive luxury. His speech was dignified, but he engaged in repartee on occasion. All accounts agree that he was a faithful husband to his wife, an unusual trait in a medieval ruler. Despite his personal austerity, John had a high conception of the imperial role and would appear in full ceremonial splendour when this was advantageous.

John was famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign. He is considered an exceptional example of a moral ruler, at a time when cruelty was the norm. He is reputed never to have condemned anyone to death or mutilation. Charity was dispensed lavishly. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. By the example of his personal morality and piety he effected a notable improvement in the manners of his age. Descriptions of him and his actions indicate that he had great self-control and personal courage, and was an excellent strategist and general.

==Early life==
John was born on 13 September 1087, the third child and first son of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos and his wife Irene Doukaina. Joannes Zonaras describes John&#x27;s birth, &quot;And then a son was born to the emperor, who was honoured with the holy baptism in the holy church of Hagia Sophia by the Patriarch. He was named John and his father then crowned him with a diadem&quot;. At a young age he was associated with his father as co-emperor, sometime between 1 September and early November, 1092. The first act in the name of both emperors was issued on 15 November 1092. The occasion of John&#x27;s elevation was celebrated by a special issue of coins with his parents depicted on the reverse and John crowned by Christ on the obverse.

Alexios I arranged a dynastic marriage for John. In 1104 or early 1105 John was married to the Hungarian princess Piroska, daughter of King Ladislaus I of Hungary. She was given the Greek name Irene, meaning &#x27;peace&#x27;, in Byzantium. This marriage sealed a political alliance, which would strengthen Byzantium&#x27;s position in the Balkans and Adriatic. In 1106 Alexios I was campaigning against the Serbs, most probably accompanied by his son John. At this time John&#x27;s wife was heavily pregnant, she was with her husband on campaign, giving birth to twins, Alexios and Maria, in Balabista, Macedonia. The question arises as to why the birth was not in Constantinople. It is reasonably supposed that John did not wish to leave his unsupported wife under the control of his mother, who would have had authority in Constantinople in the absence of both emperors. In 1108, the Treaty of Devol recorded the submission of the defeated Bohemond I of Antioch to &quot; ... the great Emperor Kyr[ios] Alexios Komnenos and of your thrice-loved son, Emperor Kyr John born in the purple&quot;. This leaves no doubt as to John&#x27;s status as co-emperor and heir apparent.

==Accession to the throne==
John II succeeded his father as ruling &quot;basileus&quot; in 1118. Despite his earlier coronation as co-emperor, the accession of John was contested. That Alexios I favoured John to succeed him is made obvious by the elevation of his son to the position of co-emperor. However, Alexios&#x27; influential wife, Irene, favoured the &quot;Caesar&quot; Nikephoros Bryennios, the husband of her eldest child Anna Komnene. Anna, who in infancy had been betrothed to her father&#x27;s first co-emperor Constantine Doukas, herself harboured obvious aspirations to power and the throne. During Alexios&#x27; final illness both wife and daughter exploited his physical weakness to apply pressure on him in support of their agenda for the succession. Alexios endured these constant demands without formally changing his intended successor. As Alexios lay dying in the monastery of the Mangana on 15 August 1118, John, relying on trusted relatives, especially his brother Isaac Komnenos, gained entry into the monastery and obtained the imperial signet ring from his father. He then assembled his armed followers and rode to the Great Palace, gathering the support of the citizenry on the way. The palace guard at first refused to admit John without clear proof of his father&#x27;s wishes, however, the mob surrounding the new emperor simply forced an entry. In the palace John was acclaimed emperor. Irene, taken by surprise, was unable either to persuade her son to step down, or to induce Nikephoros to contend for the throne. In a recent biography of Anna, however, this account of events has been disputed, in particular the involvement of John&#x27;s sister in any palace coup attempt during the days around Alexios&#x27; death, has been questioned. The weight of historical opinion remains that Anna tried at least twice to usurp her brother&#x27;s throne, resulting in her eventual perennial &#x27;house arrest&#x27;. Anna later complained that John and his successor, her nephew Emperor Manuel, kept her isolated from society for 30 years.

Alexios died the night following his son&#x27;s decisive move to take power. John refused to attend his father&#x27;s funeral, despite the pleas of his mother, because he feared a counter-coup. However, in the space of a few days, his position seemed secure. Within a year of his accession, however, John II uncovered a conspiracy to overthrow him which implicated his mother and sister. Anna&#x27;s husband Nikephoros had little sympathy with her ambitions, and it was his lack of support which doomed the conspiracy. Anna was stripped of her property, which was offered to the emperor&#x27;s friend John Axouch. Axouch wisely declined and his influence ensured that Anna&#x27;s property was eventually returned to her and that John II and his sister became reconciled, at least to a degree. Irene retired to a monastery and Anna seems to have been effectively removed from public life, taking up the less active occupation of historian. However, Nikephoros remained on good terms with his brother-in-law. One of the very few records of John&#x27;s own words concerns the plot against him; he says that after ascending the throne, God &quot;destroyed the cunning plots of my visible and invisible enemies and rescued me from every trap subjecting all my enemies under my feet&quot;. To safeguard his own succession, John crowned his young son Alexios as co-emperor around September 1119.

==Military and civil administration==
The family intrigues that challenged his succession to the throne probably contributed to John&#x27;s approach to rulership, which was to appoint men from outside the imperial family to high office. This was a radical departure from the methods of his father, who had used the imperial family and its many connections to fill almost all senior administrative and military posts.

John Axouch was John II&#x27;s closest adviser and was his only intimate friend. Axouch was a Turk captured as a child at the Siege of Nicaea, who had been given as a gift to John&#x27;s father. Emperor Alexios had thought him a good companion for his son, and so he had been brought up alongside the prince in the imperial household. Axouch was immediately appointed Grand Domestic (in Greek: μέγας δομέστικος, &quot;megas domestikos&quot;), upon the accession of John II. The Grand Domestic was the commander in chief of the Byzantine armies. It has been suggested that references to Axouch&#x27;s possession of the imperial seal early in the reign of John&#x27;s successor Manuel I meant that he was, in addition to his military duties, the head of the civil administration of the Empire. This was an unofficial position known at the time as the &quot;mesazon&quot;, and equivalent to a vizier or &#x27;prime-minister.&#x27; Such an appointment was remarkable, and a radical departure from the nepotism that had characterised the reign of Alexios I. The imperial family harboured some degree of resentment at this decision, which was reinforced by the fact that they were required to make obeisance to John Axouch whenever they met him.

John&#x27;s unwillingness to allow his family to influence his government to any great extent was to remain constant for the rest of his reign. John appointed a number of his father&#x27;s former officials to senior administrative posts, men such as Eustathios Kamytzes, Michaelitzes Styppeiotes and George Dekanos. These were men who had been politically eclipsed during the ascendancy exercised by John&#x27;s mother in the later years of the reign of Alexios I. A number of &#x27;new men&#x27; were raised to prominence by John II, these included Gregory Taronites who was appointed protovestiarios, Manuel Anemas and Theodore Vatatzes, the latter two also became his sons-in-law. John&#x27;s marriage policy, of bringing new families into the imperial orbit, may have been directed towards lessening the influence of certain prominent aristocratic clans, such as the Doukas, Diogenes and Melissenos families, some of which had produced emperors themselves in the past.

Despite his move away from close reliance on the imperial family and its connections, John&#x27;s court and government had many similarities to that of his father, not least in its serious tone and piety. Indeed, an extant collection of political advice couched in poetic form, called the &quot;Mousai&quot;, are attributed to Alexios I. The &quot;Mousai&quot; are addressed directly to John II and exhort him, amongst other things, to maintain justice during his reign and a full treasury. Alexios&#x27; advice on rulership therefore continued to be available to his son, even after the old emperor&#x27;s death.

The increase in military security and economic stability within Byzantine western Anatolia created by John II&#x27;s campaigns allowed him to begin the establishment of a formal provincial system in these regions. The theme (province) of Thrakesion was re-established, with its administrative centre at Philadelphia. A new theme, named Mylasa and Melanoudion, was created to the south of Thrakesion.

==Conspiracies of the &quot;sebastokrator&quot; Isaac==

The younger brother of John II, Isaac, had been of essential support during the accession crisis. However, despite being given the highest of court titles, that of &quot;sebastokrator&quot;, Isaac later became estranged from his brother and became an active conspirator. With trusted advisors of his own choosing, such as John Axouch, and later the support of his son and co-emperor, Alexios, John II offered no meaningful role to Isaac in the governance of the empire. In the reign of Alexios I &quot;sebastokratores&quot; had wielded considerable power and Isaac would have had an expectation of a similar level of authority being devolved on himself. This thwarted ambition is probably what disillusioned Isaac with his brother&#x27;s rule. Isaac aimed at replacing his brother as emperor. In 1130 John became aware of a plot involving Isaac and other magnates as he was leaving to campaign against the Turks. When John tried to seize Isaac, the latter escaped and fled to the Danishmend emir Ghazi, who received him, and later sent him to the breakaway Byzantine regime of the Gabrades in Trebizond. Isaac then became the guest of Masoud, the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, and subsequently of Leo, the Prince of Cilician Armenia. That Isaac was seeking aid from these princes in a bid to take the Byzantine throne by force is highly likely. Such a coalition did not materialise, but Isaac seems to have retained strong support in Constantinople. In 1132 John had to return from campaign in haste, when news reached him that conspirators in Constantinople had made an appeal to Isaac to become their ruler. The triumph that John celebrated following his capture of Kastamuni in 1133 can be seen as being a public affirmation of John&#x27;s legitimacy as emperor embodied in the celebration of the defeat of external foes. The brothers were briefly reconciled in 1138, and Isaac returned to Constantinople; however, a year later Isaac was exiled to Heraclea Pontica, where he remained for the rest of John&#x27;s life. In the extensive artwork that Isaac commissioned, he made much of his porphyrogenete status and his relationship with his imperial father, Alexios I, but he made little or no reference to his relationship to his brother John, or to the title of &quot;sebastokrator&quot; that he had received from him.

==Diplomacy==

The central tenet of the foreign policy of John II in the West was to maintain an alliance with the German emperors (Holy Roman Empire). This was necessary to limit the threat posed by the Normans of southern Italy to Byzantine territory in the Balkans. This threat became especially acute after Roger II of Sicily made himself supreme in southern Italy and assumed the title of king. Emperor Lothair III had Byzantine backing, including a large financial subsidy, for his invasion of Norman territory in 1136, which reached as far south as Bari. Pope Innocent II, with the Church&#x27;s possessions in Italy under threat by Roger II, who supported Antipope Anacletus II, was also party to the alliance of Lothair and John II. However, this alliance proved unable to resist Roger, who extracted by force a recognition of his royal title from the Pope in 1139 (Treaty of Mignano). Lothair&#x27;s successor Conrad III was approached in 1140 for a royal German bride for John&#x27;s youngest son Manuel. Bertha of Sulzbach, Conrad&#x27;s sister-in-law, was chosen and despatched to Byzantium. At much the same time Roger II applied to John II for an imperial bride for his son, but was unsuccessful.

John&#x27;s penchant for interfering with his wife&#x27;s family, the rulers of Hungary, was problematic. The welcome accorded to ousted claimants of the Hungarian throne in Constantinople was seen by the Byzantines as a useful insurance policy and source of political leverage. However, the Hungarians treated this interference as a fighting matter. A Hungarian alliance with the Serbs produced serious consequences for continued Byzantine dominance in the western Balkans.

In the East John attempted, like his father, to exploit the differences between the Seljuq Sultan of Iconium and the Danishmendid dynasty controlling the northeastern, inland, parts of Anatolia. In 1134 the Seljuq sultan Masoud provided troops for John&#x27;s attack on the Danishmend-held city of Kastamuni (reoccupied immediately after the Byzantine conquest of 1133), however, the alliance proved unreliable as the Seljuq troops abandoned the expedition, decamping during the night.

In the Crusader states of the Levant it was generally admitted that the Byzantine claims over Antioch were legally valid, though it was pragmatically viewed that only when the Byzantine emperor was in a position to enforce them militarily were they likely to be recognised in practice. The high point of John&#x27;s diplomacy in the Levant was in 1137 when he extracted formal homage from the rulers of the Principality of Antioch, County of Edessa and the County of Tripoli. The Byzantine desire to be seen as holding a level of suzerainty over all of the Crusader states was taken seriously, as evidenced by the alarm shown in the Kingdom of Jerusalem when John informed King Fulk of his plan for an armed pilgrimage to the Holy City (1142).

==Religious matters==
The reign of John II was taken up with almost constant warfare and, unlike his father who delighted in active participation in theological and doctrinal disputes, John appears to have been content to leave ecclesiastical matters to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and the church hierarchy. Only when religion impinged directly on imperial policy, as in relations with the papacy and the possible union of the Greek and Latin churches, did John take an active part. He organised a number of disputations between Greek and Latin theologians.

John, alongside his wife who shared in his religious and charitable works, is known to have undertaken church building on a considerable scale, including construction of the Monastery of Christ Pantokrator (Zeyrek Mosque) in Constantinople. This monastery, with its three churches, has been described as one of the most important and influential architectural constructions of Middle Byzantine Constantinople. Attached to the monastery was a hospital, of 5 wards, open to people of all social classes. The hospital was staffed by trained layman doctors rather than monks. The central of the three churches was the Komnenian funerary chapel, dedicated to St. Michael. It had twin domes, and is described in the &quot;typikon&quot; of the monastery as being in the form of a &quot;heroon&quot;; this emulates the older mausolea of Constantine and Justinian in the Church of the Holy Apostles.

Very active persecution of the followers of the Paulician and Bogomil heresies characterised the last few years of the reign of Alexios I. No records from the reign of John mention such persecution, though countermeasures against heresy by the Byzantine Church remained in force. A permanent synod in Constantinople investigated the writings of a deceased monk named Constantine Chrysomallos which had been circulating in certain monasteries. These works were ordered to be burnt by the Patriarch of Constantinople, Leo Styppes, in May 1140, on the grounds that they incorporated elements of Bogomil belief and practices.

One of the few members of the imperial family to be placed in an important position by John was his cousin, Adrian Komnenos (son of John&#x27;s uncle the &quot;sebastokrator&quot; Isaac). Adrian had become a monk, adopting the monastic name John, and had accompanied the emperor on his campaigns of 1138. Soon afterwards, Adrian was appointed Archbishop of Bulgaria as John IV of Ohrid. Bulgaria was an autocephalous see and required a prestigious man as archbishop.

==Military exploits==

Though he fought a number of notable pitched battles, the military strategy of John II relied on taking and holding fortified settlements in order to construct defensible frontiers. John personally conducted approximately twenty five sieges during his reign.

===The Pechenegs destroyed (1122)===
In 1119–1121 John defeated the Seljuq Turks, establishing his control over southwestern Anatolia. However, immediately afterwards, in 1122, John quickly transferred his troops to Europe to counter a Pecheneg invasion across the Danube frontier into Paristrion. These invaders had been auxiliaries of Vladimir Monomakh, the Prince of Kiev. John surrounded the Pechenegs as they burst into Thrace, tricked them into believing that he would grant them a favourable treaty, and then launched a devastating surprise attack upon their fortified camp. The ensuing Battle of Beroia was hard-fought, John was wounded in the leg by an arrow, but by the end of the day the Byzantine army had won a crushing victory. The decisive moment of the battle was when John led the Varangian Guard, largely composed of Englishmen, to assault defensive Pecheneg wagon laager, employing their famous axes to hack their way in. The battle put an effective end to the Pechenegs as an independent people; many of the captives taken in the conflict were settled as soldier-farmers within the Byzantine frontier.

===Conflict with Venice (1124–1126)===

After his accession, John II had refused to confirm his father&#x27;s 1082 treaty with the Republic of Venice, which had given the Italian republic unique and generous trading rights within the Byzantine Empire. Yet the change in policy was not motivated by financial concerns. An incident involving the abuse of a member of the imperial family by Venetians led to a dangerous conflict, especially as Byzantium had depended on Venice for its naval strength. After a Byzantine retaliatory attack on Kerkyra, John exiled the Venetian merchants from Constantinople. But this produced further retaliation, and a Venetian fleet of 72 ships plundered Rhodes, Chios, Samos, Lesbos, Andros and captured Kefalonia in the Ionian Sea. Eventually John was forced to come to terms; the war was costing him more than it was worth, and he was not prepared to transfer funds from the imperial land forces to the navy for the construction of new ships. John re-confirmed the treaty of 1082, in August 1126.

===War with the Hungarians and Serbs (1127–1129 – chronology uncertain)===
John&#x27;s marriage to the Hungarian princess Piroska involved him in the dynastic struggles of the Kingdom of Hungary. In giving asylum to Álmos, a blinded claimant to the Hungarian throne, John aroused the suspicion of the Hungarians. The Hungarians, led by Stephen II, then invaded Byzantium&#x27;s Balkan provinces in 1127, with hostilities lasting until 1129; however, an alternative chronology has been suggested with the Hungarian attack and Byzantine retaliation taking place in 1125 with a renewal of hostilities in 1126. John launched a punitive raid against the Serbs, who had dangerously aligned themselves with Hungary, many of whom were rounded up and transported to Nicomedia in Asia Minor to serve as military colonists. This was done partly to cow the Serbs into submission (Serbia was, at least nominally, a Byzantine protectorate), and partly to strengthen the Byzantine frontier in the east against the Turks. The Serbs were forced to acknowledge Byzantine suzerainty once again. The Serbian campaign may have taken place between two distinct phases in the war against Hungary. The Hungarians attacked Belgrade, Nish and Sofia; John, who was near Philippopolis in Thrace, counterattacked, supported by a naval flotilla operating on the Danube. After a challenging campaign, the details of which are obscure, the emperor managed to defeat the Hungarians and their Serbian allies at the fortress of Haram or Chramon, which is the modern Nova Palanka; many Hungarian troops were killed when a bridge they were crossing collapsed as they were fleeing from a Byzantine attack. Following this the Hungarians renewed hostilities by attacking Braničevo, which was immediately rebuilt by John. Further Byzantine military successes, Choniates mentions several engagements, resulted in a restoration of peace. The Byzantines were confirmed in their control of Braničevo, Belgrade and Zemun and they also recovered the region of Sirmium (called Frangochorion in Choniates), which had been Hungarian since the 1060s. The Hungarian pretender Álmos died in 1129, removing the major source of friction.

===War of attrition against the Anatolian Turks (1119–20, 1130–35, 1139–40)===


Early in John&#x27;s reign the Turks were pressing forward against the Byzantine frontier in western Asia Minor. In 1119, the Seljuqs had cut the land route to the city of Attaleia on the southern coast of Anatolia. John II and Axouch the Grand Domestic besieged and recaptured Laodicea in 1119 and took Sozopolis by storm in 1120, re-opening land communication with Attaleia. This route was especially important as it also led to Cilicia and the Crusader states of Syria.

Following the end of hostilities with Hungary, John was able to concentrate on Asia Minor during most of his remaining years. He undertook annual campaigns against the Danishmendid emirate in Malatya (Melitene) on the upper Euphrates from 1130 to 1135. Thanks to his energetic campaigning, Turkish attempts at expansion in Asia Minor were halted, and John prepared to take the fight to the enemy. In order to restore the region to Byzantine control, he led a series of well planned and executed campaigns against the Turks, one of which resulted in the reconquest of the ancestral home of the Komnenoi at Kastamonu (Kastra Komnenon); he then left a garrison of 2,000 men at Gangra. John quickly earned a formidable reputation as a wall-breaker, taking one stronghold after another from his enemies. Regions that had been lost to the empire since the Battle of Manzikert were recovered and garrisoned. Yet resistance, particularly from the Danishmends of the northeast, was strong, and the difficult nature of holding the new conquests is illustrated by the fact that Kastamonu was recaptured by the Turks even as John was in Constantinople celebrating its return to Byzantine rule. John persevered, however, and Kastamonu soon changed hands once more.

In the spring of 1139, the emperor campaigned with success against Turks, probably nomadic Turkomans, who were raiding the regions along the Sangarios River, striking their means of subsistence by driving off their herds. He then marched for the final time against the Danishmend Turks, his army proceeding along the southern coast of the Black Sea through Bithynia and Paphlagonia. The breakaway Byzantine regime of Constantine Gabras in Trebizond was ended, and the region of Chaldia brought back under direct imperial control. John then besieged but failed to take the city of Neocaesarea, in 1140. The Byzantines were defeated by the conditions rather than by the Turks: the weather was very bad, large numbers of the army&#x27;s horses died, and provisions became scarce.

===Campaigning in Cilicia and Syria (1137–1138)===
In the Levant, the emperor sought to reinforce Byzantine claims to suzerainty over the Crusader States and to assert his rights over Antioch. In 1137 he conquered Tarsus, Adana, and Mopsuestia from the Principality of Armenian Cilicia, and in 1138 Prince Levon I of Armenia and most of his family were brought as captives to Constantinople. This opened the route to the Principality of Antioch, where Raymond of Poitiers, Prince of Antioch, and Joscelin II, Count of Edessa, recognized themselves as vassals of the emperor in 1137. Even Raymond II, the Count of Tripoli, hastened northwards to pay homage to John, repeating the homage that his predecessor had given John&#x27;s father in 1109. There then followed a joint campaign as John led the armies of Byzantium, Antioch, and Edessa against Muslim Syria. Aleppo proved too strong to attack during an attempted siege, but the fortresses of Balat, Biza&#x27;a, Athareb, Maarat al-Numan, and Kafartab were taken by assault.

Although John fought hard for the Christian cause in the campaign in Syria, his allies Prince Raymond of Antioch and Count Joscelin II of Edessa remained in their camp playing dice and feasting instead of helping to press the siege of the city of Shaizar. The Crusader Princes were suspicious of each other and of John, and neither wanted the other to gain from participating in the campaign. Raymond also wanted to hold on to Antioch, which he had agreed to hand over to John if the campaign was successful in capturing Aleppo, Shaizar, Homs, and Hama. Latin and Muslim sources describe John&#x27;s energy and personal courage in prosecuting the siege. The city was taken, but the citadel defied assault. The Emir of Shaizar offered to pay a large indemnity, become John&#x27;s vassal, and pay yearly tribute. John had lost all confidence in his allies, and a Muslim army under Zengi was approaching to try to relieve the city, therefore the emperor reluctantly accepted the offer. The emperor was distracted by a Seljuq raid on Cilicia and developments in the west, where he was pursuing a German alliance directed against the threat posed by the Normans of Sicily. Joscelin and Raymond conspired to delay the promised handover of Antioch&#x27;s citadel to the emperor, stirring up popular unrest in the city directed at John and the local Greek community. John had little choice but to leave Syria with his ambitions only partially realised.

===Final campaigns (1142)===
In early 1142 John campaigned against the Seljuqs of Iconium to secure his lines of communication through Attalia (Antalya). During this campaign his eldest son and co-emperor Alexios died of a fever. Having secured his route, John embarked on a new expedition into Syria determined to reduce Antioch to direct imperial rule. This expedition included a planned pilgrimage to Jerusalem on which he intended to take his army. King Fulk of Jerusalem, fearing that the emperor&#x27;s presence with overwhelming military force would constrain him to make an act of homage and formally recognise Byzantine suzerainty over his kingdom, begged the emperor to bring only a modest escort. Fulk cited the inability of his largely barren kingdom to support the passage of a substantial army. This lukewarm response resulted in John II deciding to postpone his pilgrimage. John descended rapidly on northern Syria, forcing Joscelin II of Edessa to render hostages, including his daughter, as a guarantee of his good behaviour. He then advanced on Antioch demanding that the city and its citadel be surrendered to him. Raymond of Poitiers played for time, putting the proposal to the vote of the Antiochene general assembly. With the season well advanced John decided to take his army into winter quarters in Cilicia, proposing to renew his attack on Antioch the following year.

==Death and succession==
Having prepared his army for a renewed attack on Antioch, John amused himself by hunting wild boar on Mount Taurus in Cilicia, where he accidentally cut himself on the hand with a poisoned arrow. John initially ignored the wound and it became infected. He died a number of days after the accident, on 8 April 1143, probably of septicaemia. It has been suggested that John was assassinated by a conspiracy within the units of his army of Latin origins who were unhappy at fighting their co-religionists of Antioch, and who wanted to place his pro-western son Manuel on the throne. However, there is very little overt support for this hypothesis in the primary sources. John&#x27;s final action as emperor was to choose Manuel, the younger of his surviving sons, to be his successor. John is recorded as citing two main reasons for choosing Manuel over his older brother Isaac: Isaac&#x27;s irascibility, and the courage that Manuel had shown on campaign at Neocaesarea. Another theory alleges that the reason for this choice was the AIMA prophecy, which foretold that John&#x27;s successor should be one whose name began with an &quot;M&quot;. Fittingly, John&#x27;s close friend John Axouch, although he is recorded as having tried hard to persuade the dying emperor that Isaac was the better candidate to succeed, was instrumental in ensuring that Manuel&#x27;s assumption of power was free from any overt opposition.

==The legacy of John II==
Historian John Birkenmeier argued that John&#x27;s reign was the most successful of the Komnenian period. In &quot;The Development of the Komnenian Army 1081–1180,&quot; he stresses the wisdom of John&#x27;s approach to warfare, which focused on sieges rather than risking pitched battles. Birkenmeier argues that John&#x27;s strategy of launching annual campaigns with limited, realistic objectives was a more sensible one than that followed by his son Manuel I. According to this view, John&#x27;s campaigns benefited the Byzantine Empire because they protected the empire&#x27;s heartland, which lacked reliable borders, while gradually extending its territory in Asia Minor. The Turks were forced onto the defensive, while John kept his diplomatic situation relatively simple by allying with the Holy Roman Emperor against the Normans of Sicily.

Overall, it is clear that John II Komnenos left the empire a great deal better off than he had found it. By the time of his death substantial territories had been recovered, and the goals of the recovery of control over central Anatolia and the re-establishment of a frontier on the Euphrates seemed achievable. However some Greeks of the interior of Anatolia were becoming increasingly accustomed to Turkish rule and often found it preferable to that of Byzantium, as seen in the Battle of Lake Pousgouse. Also, though it was relatively easy to extract submission and admissions of vassalage from the Anatolian Turks, Serbs and Crusader States of the Levant, converting these relationships into concrete gains for the security of the Empire had proven elusive. These problems were left for his gifted and mercurial son, Manuel, to attempt to solve.

==Family==
John II Komnenos married Princess Piroska of Hungary (renamed Irene), a daughter of King Ladislaus I of Hungary in 1104; the marriage was intended as compensation for the loss of some territories to King Coloman of Hungary. She played little part in government, devoting herself to piety and their large brood of children. Irene died on 13 August 1134, and was later venerated as Saint Irene. John II and Irene had 8 children:
# Alexios Komnenos (October 1106 – summer 1142), co-emperor from 1119 to 1142
# Maria Komnene (twin to Alexios), who married John Roger Dalassenos
# Andronikos Komnenos (died 1142)
# Anna Komnene ( – after 1149), who married the admiral Stephen Kontostephanos, who died in battle in 1149. The couple had four children.
# Isaac Komnenos ( – after 1154), raised to &quot;sebastokrator&quot; in 1122, he was superseded in the succession in favour of Manuel in 1143; married twice and had several children.
# Theodora Komnene ( – before May 1157), who married the military commander Manuel Anemas, who was killed in action, after which she entered a monastery. The couple had at least four children.
# Eudokia Komnene ( – before 1150), who married the military commander Theodore Vatatzes. She had at least six children, but died early.
# Manuel I Komnenos (28 November 1118 – 21 September 1180), became emperor, and reigned 1143–1180.
