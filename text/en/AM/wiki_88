<text>The San Jose Sharks are a professional ice hockey team based in San Jose, California. The Sharks compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference. The franchise is owned by San Jose Sports &amp; Entertainment Enterprises. Beginning play in the 1991–92 season, the team initially played its home games at the Cow Palace, before moving to its present home, now named SAP Center at San Jose, in 1993; the SAP Center is known locally as &quot;the Shark Tank&quot;. The Sharks are affiliated with the San Jose Barracuda of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Wichita Thunder of the ECHL.

The Sharks were founded on May 9, 1990 after the owners of the Minnesota North Stars sold the stake to award the NHL franchise based in the San Francisco Bay Area. They were the first team to be based in the region since the California Golden Seals relocated to Cleveland in 1976. The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016. They have won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy once, as the team with the league&#x27;s best regular season record in the 2008–09 season. They have also won six division titles as a member of the Pacific Division since 1993.

==History==

===Formation===
Professional ice hockey in the Bay Area can be traced to the San Francisco Shamrocks of the Pacific Coast Hockey League (PCHL) from 1944 to 1950. The Sharks origins began with the San Francisco Seals of the Western Hockey League (WHL) when they were awarded an expansion franchise for San Francisco on April 23, 1961, to former Vancouver Canucks owner Coleman (Coley) Hall, on the condition that an ice surface is installed in the Cow Palace. The Seals won three WHL championships and were renamed to the California Seals in 1966, playing their games at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.

The following season, the California Golden Seals joined the NHL, played their seasons from 1967 to 1976, who were neither successful on the ice nor at the box office. Gordon and George Gund III became minority owners of the Seals in 1974, and were instrumental in their move to Cleveland in 1976 and a 1978 merger with the Minnesota North Stars, which they purchased that year. They had long wanted to bring ice hockey back to the Bay Area, and asked the NHL for permission to move the North Stars there in the late 1980s, but the league vetoed the proposed move. Meanwhile, a group led by former Hartford Whalers owner Howard Baldwin was pushing the NHL to bring a team to San Jose, where a new arena was being built. Eventually, the League struck a compromise: the Gunds would sell their share of the North Stars to Baldwin&#x27;s group, with the Gunds receiving an expansion team in the Bay Area to begin play in the 1991–92 season and being allowed to take a certain number of players from the North Stars to their new club. In return, the North Stars would be allowed to participate as an equal partner in an expansion draft with the new Bay Area team. On May 5, 1990, the Gunds officially sold their share of the North Stars to Baldwin and were awarded a new team for the Bay Area, based in San Jose. The owners paid to the league an expansion fee of US$45 million and the new franchise was approved on May 9.

Over 5,000 potential names were submitted by mail for the new team. While the first-place finisher was &quot;Blades&quot;, the Gunds were concerned about the name&#x27;s potentially negative association with weapons, and went with the runner-up, &quot;Sharks.&quot; The name was said to have been inspired by the large number of sharks living in the Pacific Ocean. Seven varieties live there, and one area of water near the Bay Area is known as the &quot;red triangle&quot; (hence the triangle in the team&#x27;s logo) because of its shark population.

Matt Levine—the team&#x27;s first marketing head—said of the new name, &quot;Sharks are relentless, determined, swift, agile, bright and fearless. We plan to build an organization that has all those qualities.&quot;

===Cow Palace years (1991–1993)===

For their first two seasons, the Sharks played at the Cow Palace in Daly City, just outside San Francisco, a facility the NHL and the Seals had rejected in 1967. Pat Falloon was their first draft choice and led the team in points during their first season. The team was placed in the Campbell Conference&#x27;s Smythe Division. George Kingston was their first head coach during their first two seasons. Though the 1991–92 roster consisted primarily of NHL journeymen, minor leaguers and rookies, the Sharks had at least one notable player when they acquired 14-year veteran and former Norris Trophy-winning defenseman Doug Wilson from the Chicago Blackhawks on September 6, 1991. Wilson was named the team&#x27;s first captain and All-Star representative in the inaugural season. However, the Sharks&#x27; first two seasons saw the typical struggles for an expansion team. The 71 losses in 1992–93 is an NHL record, and they also suffered a 17-game losing streak, while winning just 11 games and earning a mere 24 points in the standings. Kingston was fired following the end of the 1992–93 season.

Despite the Sharks&#x27; futility in the standings, the team led the NHL&#x27;s merchandise sales with $150 million, accounting for 27% of the NHL&#x27;s total and behind only National Basketball Association champions Chicago Bulls among all North American leagues. Several team &quot;firsts&quot; happened in the 1992–93 season. On November 17, 1992, San Jose goaltender Arturs Irbe recorded the first shutout in team history, defeating the Los Angeles Kings 6–0. On December 3, against the Hartford Whalers at the Cow Palace, right winger Rob Gaudreau scored the first hat-trick in franchise history; he also scored the team&#x27;s second-ever hat-trick nine days later against the Quebec Nordiques.

The inaugural year also saw the introduction of the San Jose Sharks mascot, &quot;S. J. Sharkie&quot;. On January 28, 1992, at a game against the New York Rangers, the then-unnamed mascot emerged from a Zamboni during an intermission. A &quot;Name the Mascot&quot; contest began that night, with the winning name of &quot;S. J. Sharkie&quot; being announced on April 15, 1992.

===Early success and rebuilding (1993–1997)===

For their third season, 1993–94, the Sharks moved to their new home, the San Jose Arena, and were placed in the Western Conference&#x27;s Pacific Division. Under head coach Kevin Constantine, the Sharks pulled off the biggest turnaround in NHL history, finishing with a 33–35–16 record and making the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in team history with 82 points, an NHL record 58-point jump from the previous season. They were seeded eighth in the Western Conference playoffs and faced the Detroit Red Wings, the top-seeded Western Conference team and a favorite to win the Stanley Cup. In one of the biggest upsets in Stanley Cup playoff history, the underdog Sharks shocked the Red Wings in seven games. In Game 7 at Joe Louis Arena, Jamie Baker scored the game-winning goal in the third period after goaltender Chris Osgood was out of position and the Sharks won 3–2. In the second round, the Sharks had a 3–2 series lead over the Toronto Maple Leafs, but lost the final two games in Toronto, including an overtime loss in Game 6.

In 1994–95, the Sharks earned their second-straight playoff berth and again reached the second round. Ray Whitney scored a goal in double overtime of Game 7 of the conference quarterfinals against the Calgary Flames. Key Sharks players included goaltender Arturs Irbe, defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh and forwards Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov. Despite their success against Calgary, round two would prove to be a disaster for the Sharks, when they lost in a four-game sweep to Detroit (in a rematch of the previous year) without even holding a single lead in all four games. However, the 1995 season also saw the only rainout in the history of the NHL, when the Guadalupe River flooded its banks in March 1995, making it impossible for anyone to get into the San Jose Arena for a game between the Sharks and the Detroit Red Wings.

In 1995–96, the Sharks finished last in the Pacific Division and failed to make the playoffs. The team also underwent major changes: during the season, they traded Ozolinsh and Larionov, and Irbe, who had suffered an off-ice injury, was released at the end of the season. The team began rebuilding, acquiring forward Owen Nolan from the Colorado Avalanche, as well as several other players. Constantine was fired midway through the season and replaced by interim coach Jim Wiley.

===Dean Lombardi era (1996–2003)===
During the 1996 off-season, Dean Lombardi was hired as general manager. The next season was no better under Al Sims, with the Sharks again finishing last and winning only 27 games. Their standing would help them draft Patrick Marleau in the 1997 NHL entry draft. The Sharks returned to the playoffs in 1997–98 with goaltender Mike Vernon, whom they acquired from the Red Wings, and new head coach Darryl Sutter. For the next two years, the Sharks made the playoffs, yet never advanced past the first round. In 1999, San Jose acquired former Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens star Vincent Damphousse. San Jose&#x27;s luck changed in the 1999–2000 season, when the Sharks finished with their first-ever winning record. In an upset on par with the one they had pulled on Detroit six years earlier, the Sharks managed to eliminate the St. Louis Blues, who had finished first overall in the league that year, in seven games. However, the Sharks were defeated in the second round of the playoffs by the Dallas Stars. It was their second time losing to Dallas.
In 2000–01, Kazakh goaltender Evgeni Nabokov won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s best rookie. The team also acquired Finnish star forward Teemu Selanne from the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. In the 2001 playoffs, the St. Louis Blues eliminated the Sharks in six games in the first round, avenging their 2000 defeat by San Jose. The team&#x27;s breakout year was 2001–02. Veteran Adam Graves was acquired for Mikael Samuelsson, and the Sharks won their first Pacific Division title. They then defeated the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round of the 2002 playoffs, but fell to the Colorado Avalanche in the second round.

Following the 2001–02 season, the Gunds sold the Sharks to a group of local investors headed by team president Greg Jamison. With starting goaltender Nabokov and defenseman Mike Rathje in contract disputes with general manager Dean Lombardi and the retirement of veteran defenseman Gary Suter, the team got off to a terrible start. Kyle McLaren was acquired in a three-way trade with the Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins. Dan McGillis was acquired in exchange for long-time Shark Marcus Ragnarsson, but the team could not turn itself around. Sutter was fired and replaced by Ron Wilson midway through that season.

Near the 2003 NHL trade deadline, captain Owen Nolan was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs, signaling a new era in Sharks history. In addition, the newly acquired McGillis was traded to Boston, Bryan Marchment went to Colorado, and American Hockey League (AHL) star Shawn Heins and forward Matt Bradley were moved to the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Sharks acquired Alyn McCauley and Wayne Primeau during this season. Reportedly, due to having just acquired the team as well as the team&#x27;s bad start, the ownership group wanted general manager Dean Lombardi to move high-priced players on the roster. Lombardi failed to do so and consequently lost his job. During that debacle year for San Jose, there were some bright spots. Jim Fahey led all rookie defensemen in the NHL in points, despite playing in only 43 games.

Lombardi&#x27;s tenure with the team ended with his dismissal on March 18, 2003. Doug Wilson was named to the role on May 13.

===Doug Wilson era (2003–2022)===

====Resurgence (2003–2005)====
The 2003–04 season, under new general manager Doug Wilson and head coach Ron Wilson saw another turnaround for the team, resulting in the team&#x27;s best season to that point. An injection of youth, with players like Christian Ehrhoff and out-of-college signing Tom Preissing, and the influx of energy from Alexander Korolyuk jump-started San Jose. Doug Wilson acquired Nils Ekman, and a line of Ekman, McCauley and Korolyuk provided strong play for San Jose, with all three players enjoying career years. Midway through the season, key forward Marco Sturm suffered a broken leg/ankle injury. In response, San Jose acquired Curtis Brown. They posted the third-best record in the NHL with 104 points (31 more than the previous season, and the first time the team had earned 100 points), won the Pacific Division championship and were seeded second in the Western Conference.
In the 2004 playoffs, the Sharks defeated the St. Louis Blues in the conference quarterfinals and the Colorado Avalanche in the conference semifinals. The San Jose Sharks, for the first time, progressed to the conference finals. However, they fell to the Calgary Flames, with ex-Sharks coach Daryl Sutter behind the Flames&#x27; bench and former Sharks goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff in net. During that season, San Jose, without a captain following Nolan&#x27;s trade, utilized a rotating captaincy. When the job eventually fell to Patrick Marleau, he kept the captaincy. During the off-season, forward Vincent Damphousse was lost to the Colorado Avalanche (but never played a game for them, as he announced his retirement during the 2004–05 lockout).

====Arrival of Joe Thornton (2005–2006)====
The Sharks started the 2005–06 season slowly, dropping to last place in the Pacific Division. The team lost Alexander Korolyuk. After a ten-game losing streak, the Sharks traded Brad Stuart, Wayne Primeau and Marco Sturm to the Boston Bruins in exchange for star player Joe Thornton. The trade re-energized the team, and with Nabokov sharing starting duties with backup goaltender Vesa Toskala, the Sharks rallied back from their early-season slump to clinch the fifth seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, the Sharks defeated the Nashville Predators in the conference quarterfinals before falling to the Edmonton Oilers in the conference semifinals. Joe Thornton was awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, as well as the Art Ross Trophy for leading the League in points, with 125. Jonathan Cheechoo was awarded the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy for scoring the most goals during the regular season, with a total of 56.

====Playoff contention, falling short of expectation (2006–2015)====
The Sharks entered the 2006–07 season as the youngest team in average age, as well as the biggest team in average weight, and they raced out to a 20–7–0 start, the best in franchise history. A concern made by fans and members of the media was the lack of a left winger to play on a line with the duo of Thornton and Cheechoo. Wilson seemingly addressed this issue by acquiring 25-year-old 20-goal-scorer Mark Bell from the Chicago Blackhawks. Despite scoring a goal in his first two games with San Jose, Bell was widely considered a flop in San Jose. Off-ice issues, including being cited for drunk driving and an alleged hit-and-run contributed to his on-ice play. By the end of the season, Bell was consistently either a healthy scratch or a fourth-liner.
Two significant trades were made at the trade deadline for defenseman Craig Rivet and winger Bill Guerin. The trades coincided with Nabokov putting together a string of outstanding performances. The Sharks finished the regular season with the best record in franchise history at 51–26–5. In the conference quarterfinals, the Sharks defeated the Nashville Predators for the second year in a row. In the conference semifinals, the Sharks were defeated for the second time by the Detroit Red Wings.

In advance of the 2007–08 season, the Sharks updated their logos and jerseys to adjust to the new Rbk EDGE jersey.

The Sharks rode on a very hot streak in the month of March. They were aided by the trade-deadline acquisition of Brian Campbell, for whom they gave up Steve Bernier. Going the entire month without a regulation loss, the Sharks captured their third Pacific Division title with a franchise-record 108 points. San Jose started the 2008 playoffs beating the Calgary Flames four games to three in San Jose&#x27;s first-ever Game 7 on home ice. San Jose eventually lost to the Dallas Stars in the conference semifinals. Game 6 required four overtime periods, and was the longest game in the team&#x27;s history. This was the Sharks&#x27; third playoff loss to Dallas.

The Ron Wilson era officially came to an end on May 12 when the Sharks fired him, citing San Jose&#x27;s disappointing second-round losses in the previous three seasons. Wilson ended his tenure in San Jose with 206 wins, 122 losses, 19 ties, and 48 losses in overtime or in the shootout in 385 regular season games and a 28–24 record in 52 postseason games. He moved on to be hired as head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs, along with assistant coaches who were also two former Sharks, Tim Hunter and Rob Zettler, to make up the Toronto coaching staff.

On June 11, 2008, the San Jose Sharks named former Detroit Red Wings assistant coach Todd McLellan as their new head coach for the 2008–09 season. Todd Richards, Trent Yawney and Jay Woodcroft were named assistant coaches, while Brett Heimlich was named staff assistant. During the off-season, San Jose&#x27;s major headlines included signing defenseman Rob Blake, acquiring defensemen Dan Boyle and Brad Lukowich, as well as trading defenseman Craig Rivet to the Buffalo Sabres. Midway through the season, San Jose added playoff warrior Claude Lemieux to their roster. Lemieux, 43 years old, was rejoining the NHL after a five-year absence. At the trade deadline, San Jose acquired checking-line winger Travis Moen and the injured defenseman Kent Huskins from the Anaheim Ducks.

The Sharks finished the regular season as Presidents&#x27; Trophy champions with 53 wins and 117 points, both franchise records. Despite their successful regular season, the Sharks were eliminated by the eighth-seeded Anaheim Ducks in six games in the first round of the playoffs. The team was heavily criticized for once again failing to succeed in the postseason. General manager Doug Wilson promised the team would undergo significant changes in the off-season.
In the 2009 off-season, Wilson held to his word with many major moves. The first was Christian Ehrhoff and Brad Lukowich to the Vancouver Canucks. It was widely believed that San Jose made this trade so it could free up salary cap space to make a second trade: Milan Michalek and Jonathan Cheechoo were sent to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Dany Heatley and a draft pick. Assistant coach Todd Richards left and was replaced by Matt Shaw. Aside from the trades, several contracts were not renewed, including those of Mike Grier, Marcel Goc, Tomas Plihal and Alexei Semenov.

San Jose also signed forward Scott Nichol and added grit to the team by signing Joe Callahan, Jed Ortmeyer and Manny Malhotra, plus Benn Ferriero. Jeremy Roenick and Claude Lemieux both announced their retirements from the NHL. Another major move by San Jose was stripping Patrick Marleau of the captaincy and assigning it to the newly re-signed Rob Blake. One reason for the move was that Marleau was named captain by Wilson and McLellan wanted to name his own. Dan Boyle and Joe Thornton were named the alternates. On February 7, 2010, San Jose acquired Niclas Wallin from the Carolina Hurricanes. On February 12, 2010, San Jose traded Jody Shelley to the New York Rangers for a draft pick.

The Sharks finished the regular season leading the Western Conference with 113 points and being the second team in the NHL after the Washington Capitals. In the conference quarterfinals, the Sharks eliminated the Colorado Avalanche. In the conference semifinals, the Sharks defeated the Detroit Red Wings. The eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Chicago Blackhawks, beat the Sharks in the conference finals with a four-game sweep.

On June 23, 2010, Wilson announced that they would not offer an unrestricted free agent contract to long-time goaltender Evgeni Nabokov after playing ten seasons with the team. Due to the cap issue, the Sharks had to choose between former captain Patrick Marleau and Nabokov. On July 1, 2010, the Sharks signed goalie Antero Niittymaki from the Tampa Bay Lightning. On September 2, 2010, the Sharks signed former member of the Chicago Blackhawks and Stanley Cup-winning goaltender Antti Niemi to a one-year contract. Niemi was the goaltender who helped the Blackhawks defeat the Sharks in the conference finals the season before. On March 1, 2011, Niemi signed a four-year contract extension with San Jose worth $15.2 million.
On March 31, 2011, the Sharks clinched their 13th (and seventh consecutive) playoff berth in franchise history with a 6–0 victory over the Dallas Stars. Five days later, they clinched their sixth Pacific Division championship. Entering the 2011 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference, the Sharks opened their playoff run with the franchise&#x27;s first-ever playoff series against division and state rivals, the Los Angeles Kings. After winning Game 1, 3–2 in overtime on a Joe Pavelski goal, the Sharks dropped the second game of the series 4–0, heading to Staples Center with the series tied at one apiece. The Kings took another 4–0 lead in Game 3 but five-second-period goals by the Sharks capped with a Devin Setoguchi overtime winner gave the Sharks a 6–5 victory and tied them for the second-biggest comeback in Stanley Cup playoff history. They would go on to win Game 4, lose Game 5 and finally win the series in its sixth game, with captain Joe Thornton scoring the series winner in the third overtime game of the series.

The Sharks advanced to the conference semifinals to face the third-seed Detroit Red Wings, whom they had defeated in five games during the previous postseason&#x27;s second round. Just like the year prior, the Sharks won the first three games of the series and lost the fourth but instead of replicating the previous year&#x27;s success in Game 5, the Sharks dropped two more games as the Red Wings became the eighth team in NHL history to force a Game 7 after losing the first three games of a series. However, they would not become the fourth team in history to pull off the comeback as the Sharks prevailed, 3–2, with the game-winning goal scored by former captain Patrick Marleau who had endured media criticism from former teammate and now NBC Sports Network television personality Jeremy Roenick for his lackluster play in Game 5 of the series against the Red Wings. The Sharks advanced to their third conference finals series, their first playoff meeting with the Vancouver Canucks. San Jose dropped the first two games of the series at Rogers Arena in Vancouver but rebounded with a 4–3 victory thanks to two first-period goals by Marleau in Game 3. However, they lost the fourth game of the series and eventually were eliminated from the playoffs after a Game 5 in Vancouver that featured a game-tying goal by the Canucks&#x27; Ryan Kesler with 18.3 seconds remaining in the third period as well as a quirky bounce off a side stanchion that allowed Kevin Bieksa to score the overtime goal that advanced Vancouver to their third Stanley Cup Finals and left the Sharks eliminated in Round 3 for the second consecutive postseason.
The first major move made by San Jose in the 2011 off-season was to trade popular winger (and former first-round pick) Devin Setoguchi, the Sharks&#x27; 2010 first-round pick Charlie Coyle and a first-round pick in the 2011 NHL entry draft to the Minnesota Wild for All-Star defenseman Brent Burns and a second-round pick in the 2012 NHL entry draft. This came after Setoguchi had signed a three-year, $9 million contract extension with the Sharks. The Sharks continued their off-season retool by orchestrating a second transaction with the Wild, shipping Dany Heatley to Minnesota in exchange for Martin Havlat, both to relieve cap space as Heatley was slated to carry a cap hit $2.5 million greater than Havlat&#x27;s for the duration of their respective contracts and to acquire a player in Havlat with a history of playoff production at the expense of Heatley, whose postseason numbers with the Sharks had been far less than stellar – the forward had managed to score just five goals in 32 playoff games in two years with San Jose.

The Sharks finished the 2011–12 season with a 43–29–10 record, good for 96 points and the seventh seed in the Stanley Cup playoffs. However, after winning Game 1 of their first-round series with the St. Louis Blues in overtime, they lost the final four games of the series, marking the second time they lost in the conference quarterfinals under Todd McLellan. It was later announced that McLellan would remain on the bench for a fifth season.

Prior to the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Hockey Hall of Fame player and coach Larry Robinson was added to McLellan&#x27;s coaching staff to assist with San Jose&#x27;s penalty-killing unit, which was 29th in the NHL during the previous season. Assistant coach Jim Johnson was also added to bring a defensive style to the play of the Sharks. Brett Heimlich was also promoted to the role of video coordinator to assist the new coaching staff. Along with the two coaches, veteran defenseman Brad Stuart was re-acquired in order to bolster the Sharks&#x27; blue line, and on January 12, he played in his first game at HP Pavilion in over seven years. In the first round of the 2013 playoffs, the Sharks swept the Vancouver Canucks, their first series-sweep in franchise history. The Sharks would subsequently fall 4–3 to the defending Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings in the second round of the playoffs.

Prior to the 2013–14 season, the Sharks unveiled new uniforms, which included less orange, along with adding a lace-up collar. In addition to the new uniforms, prior to the start of the season, Brett Heimlich took on the additional role of statistical analyst for the coaching staff. The Sharks started the season 8–0–1, and were the last team in the NHL to stay undefeated in regulation until October 25, when the Sharks lost to the Boston Bruins. In the first round of the 2014 playoffs, the Sharks were matched with rivals and eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings. Although the Sharks took a 3–0 series lead, the Kings came back to tie the series before advancing with a 5–1 win in game seven (only the fourth time in the 97-year history of the NHL where a team lost a best-of-seven series after winning their first three games). After the loss, general manager Doug Wilson described the Sharks&#x27; playoff failures &quot;like Charlie Brown trying to kick a football&quot;.

On August 20, 2014, head coach Todd McLellan announced the team would go into training camp for the 2014–15 season without a captain, and that all players (including former captains Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau) would have the opportunity to compete for the captaincy. No captain was named during the season. The Sharks hosted the 2015 Stadium Series against the Kings at Levi&#x27;s Stadium in February 2015, losing 2–1. Earlier in the season, the Sharks were in playoff contention, but they would ultimately lose games to key Western Conference opponents as the season went on. Despite posting a record of 40–33–9, the Sharks finished fifth in the Pacific Division and missed the playoffs for the first time in ten years. On April 20, 2015, the team announced that they had agreed to &quot;part ways&quot; with McLellan, Johnson and Woodcroft, as well as Video Coordinator Heimlich.

====First Stanley Cup Finals and continued contention (2015–2019)====

On May 28, 2015, the team named Peter DeBoer as their head coach. During the off-season, the Sharks let John Scott and Scott Hannan leave as free agents. They traded goalie Antti Niemi to the Dallas Stars for a seventh-round draft pick in the 2015 NHL entry draft. Then, they acquired forward Joel Ward, goaltender Martin Jones, and defenseman Paul Martin. They also named forward Joe Pavelski the team&#x27;s captain.

Nearly one year after Peter DeBoer&#x27;s arrival and a shaky start, the Sharks surged in the second half of the season to return to the playoffs, finishing with 98 points and third in the Pacific Division. They defeated the Los Angeles Kings in five games, the Nashville Predators in seven games, and the St. Louis Blues in six games to win the Western Conference championship. This marked the first time in franchise history that the Sharks advanced to play in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Sharks ultimately lost the Stanley Cup Finals in the best-of-seven series against the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games.

In the following season, the Sharks finished in third place in the Pacific Division, but were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers in six games in the first round of the 2017 playoffs. Following the season, long-time stalwart Patrick Marleau left the team to sign with the Toronto Maple Leafs, ending his 20-year tenure with the team. He left holding almost every offensive record in team history, such as power-play goals, goals, short-handed goals and games played.

In the 2017–18 season, the Sharks once again finished in third place in the Pacific Division. They swept the Anaheim Ducks in the first round of the 2018 playoffs, but lost to the expansion Vegas Golden Knights in six games in the second round.

The 2018–19 season saw another playoff berth for the Sharks, overcoming a 3–1 series lead, once again by the Vegas Golden Knights, and in a dramatic comeback in the third period of game seven in the first round. The Sharks would go on to defeat the Colorado Avalanche in the second round in seven games to make it into the conference finals, falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues in six games. On October 8, 2019, after two seasons in Toronto, Patrick Marleau was re-acquired by the Sharks.

====Missing the playoffs (2019–2022)====
On December 11, 2019, with the Sharks at 15–16–2 and failing to win a game during their five-game away game stretch, DeBoer and his staff were fired. After DeBoer&#x27;s firing, assistant coach Bob Boughner was named interim head coach. In March 2020, four months after Boughner became interim coach, the league was forced to suspend operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the 2019–20 season resumed in June with the playoffs, the Sharks were not included, finishing in last place in both the Pacific Division and Western Conference. Boughner&#x27;s interim label was removed on September 22, 2020.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the divisions for the 2020–21 season were realigned. The Sharks played in the West Division. The Sharks missed the playoffs for the second year in a row.

General manager Doug Wilson took medical leave beginning November 26, 2021, and resigned while away from the team on April 7, 2022. Assistant general manager Joe Will was elevated to interim general manager while the team sought a permanent candidate for the role.

The team missed the playoffs for the third straight season, and head coach Bob Boughner and other members of the coaching staff were relieved of duties in the summer in advance of the Sharks naming a new general manager.

===Mike Grier era (2022–present)===

====Rebuilding (2022–present)====
On July 5, 2022, the Sharks hired former player Mike Grier to serve as their new general manager, becoming the first black general manager in NHL history and fifth general manager in franchise history. Grier, who played in 221 games with the Sharks from 2006 to 2009 and was a member of the Sharks 2008–09 Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning team, immediately began reshaping the team. 

On July 13, the Sharks traded longtime defenseman Brent Burns to the Carolina Hurricanes and signed forwards Oskar Lindblom, Nico Sturm, and defenseman Matt Benning. On July 26, Grier named former Rangers head coach David Quinn as the team&#x27;s new head coach before later hiring Scott Gordon and Ryan Warsofsky as assistants. San Jose opened its season in Europe as part of the 2022 NHL Global Series, with an exhibition match against Eisbaren Berlin in Berlin, Germany on October 4, 2022, and a two-game series against Nashville in Prague, Czech Republic to kick off the 2022–23 regular season on October 7 and 8. 

On February 25, 2023, the Sharks retired Patrick Marleau&#x27;s number 12 in a pre-game ceremony prior to San Jose&#x27;s game against Chicago. Marleau&#x27;s number was the first to be retired in franchise history. The speedy forward retired with 1,607 regular season appearances for San Jose and held almost all franchise offensive records. Following a series of smaller trades in January and early February, San Jose and New Jersey Devils executed a blockbuster 11-piece trade on February 26, in which the Sharks sent star forward Timo Meier to New Jersey in exchange for multiple future assets, including two conditional first-round draft selections, 2020 first-round pick Shakir Mukhamadullin and winger Fabian Zetterlund. In their first season under Grier and Quinn, the Sharks finished in seventh place in the Pacific Division, 14th place in the Western Conference, and missed the playoffs for the fourth straight season. 

The Sharks were led in scoring by defenseman Erik Karlsson, who finished with 101 points and 67 assists, both of which are records by a Sharks defenseman. He scored a pair of goals on April 10, in Winnipeg to become the sixth defenseman in NHL history to record 100 points and first since Brian Leetch in 1991–92. His goal, assist and point totals at the end of the season led all NHL defensemen, and he was named to his seventh NHL All-Star game. On May 4, Karlsson was named a Norris Trophy finalist. On May 10, he was named a finalist for the Ted Lindsay Award, given to &quot;the most outstanding player in the NHL&quot; as voted by fellow members of the NHL Players&#x27; Association. He was awarded the Norris Trophy on June 26, the third of his career and second won by a Sharks defenseman.

On May 8, 2023, San Jose was awarded the fourth overall selection in the 2023 NHL entry draft through the NHL&#x27;s draft lottery process, their highest-held selection since the 1998 NHL entry draft. With the pick, San Jose selected center Will Smith out of the U.S. National Team Development Program. On August 6, San Jose traded Karlsson to the Pittsburgh Penguins as part of a three-team trade also featuring the Montreal Canadiens. San Jose received a conditional first-round selection from Pittsburgh in the 2024 NHL entry draft, along with forwards Mikael Granlund and Mike Hoffman and defenseman Jan Rutta.

On November 4, 2023, the Sharks became the first team since the 1965–66 Boston Bruins to allow 10 goals in consecutive games. After the 2023–24 season, head coach David Quinn was fired. On May 7, 2024, the Sharks won the NHL draft lottery for the first time in franchise history, securing the number 1 pick for the 2024 NHL entry draft, and went on to pick 18-year old Macklin Celebrini. Assistant coach Ryan Warsofsky was announced as Quinn&#x27;s replacement as head coach on June 13, 2024.

==Team information==

===Logo and jerseys===

The Sharks&#x27; iconic logo of a shark chomping on a hockey stick has been in use since their inaugural 1991–92 season, with slight modifications prior to the 2007–08 season. The triangle on the logo references the Bay Area&#x27;s Red Triangle near the Pacific Ocean. The Sharks also use various partial and alternate logos based on the primary logo.

The original Sharks&#x27; road jerseys were teal with white, gray and black striping and featured white block lettering with black trim. Home uniforms were white with teal, gray and black striping and featured teal block lettering with black trim. Both jerseys included the team&#x27;s &quot;fin&quot; logo on either shoulder and were used until the 1997–98 season.

The Sharks introduced their future road (later home) jersey as an alternate during the 1997–98 season, featuring a darker teal base, wide gray sleeve and shoulder striping and modernized lettering. A white home (later road) counterpart was introduced the following season and featured teal and gray shoulder and sleeve stripes. In the 2001–02 season, the Sharks began wearing a black third jersey, featuring the return of the fin logo on the shoulders and minimalist teal and white sleeve stripes.

Upon switching to the Reebok Edge template in 2007, the Sharks introduced new home and away jerseys. The teal home jersey featured a black shoulder yoke while the white road jersey used a teal shoulder yoke. Both jerseys replaced gray with orange trim on the stripes and lettering, added numbers on the right chest, and featured the full-body (or &quot;jumping&quot;) shark logo on the shoulders.

Before the 2008–09 season, the Sharks introduced a new black alternate jersey, without the contrasting shoulder yoke, tail stripes or orange trim. It also featured the jumping shark logo in front and the &quot;SJ&quot; alternate logo on the shoulders. The jersey served as the basis of their new set introduced before the 2013–14 season, which removed the shoulder yoke, orange accents, and tail stripes while adding neckline laces. The front numbers were replaced with the Sharks&#x27; 25th-anniversary logo prior to the 2015–16 season.

Following the switch to Adidas&#x27; AdiZero template in 2017, the Sharks kept much of their basic look save for the replacement of the &quot;jumping shark&quot; logo in favor of the &quot;screaming shark&quot; logo (home jersey) and &quot;SJ&quot; logo (road jersey) on the shoulder. The slogan &quot;This Is Sharks Territory&quot; was added inside the neckline. The black alternates were retired prior to the season, but in 2018, a new black jersey was introduced. Known as the &quot;Stealth&quot; jersey, it featured a slightly different rendition of the primary Sharks logo, an updated version of the original &quot;fin&quot; logo on the shoulders and stylized circuit board sleeve striping. The Stealth uniforms were not used in the 2020–21 season as the Sharks opted to wear their &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; and &quot;Heritage&quot; alternate uniforms in the shortened season (see descriptions below).

The Sharks participated in the 2015 Stadium Series by wearing a tricolor jersey of teal, white and black accented by the primary Sharks logo in front and a new &quot;Northern California&quot; alternate logo on the shoulders. The back of the jersey remained teal and featured larger lettering.

During the 2015–16 season, as part of their 25th anniversary, the Sharks wore a slightly modified version of their original teal jerseys for a few home games. These uniforms were brought back in 2021 for the Sharks&#x27; 30th anniversary, albeit modified to the AdiZero cut.

The Sharks wore Reverse Retro alternate uniforms for the 2020–21 season. The design used was similar to the teal uniforms they wore from 1997 to 2007, but with a gray base and black stripes.

The Sharks released new uniforms in 2022, featuring elements inspired from the team&#x27;s original 1991–1998 uniform set. In addition, the Sharks changed their pants, gloves and home helmet to teal. The Sharks also unveiled a second &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; uniform based on the last uniforms worn by their Bay Area predecessors, the California Golden Seals. The design replaced the &quot;Seals&quot; wordmark with &quot;Sharks&quot; in teal and gold trim.

In the 2023–24 season, the Sharks unveiled a new &quot;Cali Fin&quot; black alternate uniform, featuring the updated fin logo as the main crest, along with a modified version of the &quot;Northern California&quot; shoulder patch adopted from the 2015 Stadium Series uniform. In addition to teal and white stripes, a teal yarn-dye-esque striping pattern adorned the sleeves, tail and socks. Also during the season, the Sharks began wearing their teal helmets on road games as well, as part of a new NHL mandate that allowed teams to wear colored helmets on road games as long as they were in a different color from the home team.

CSN Bay Area (now NBC Sports Bay Area) was the television home of San Jose Sharks until the end of the 2008–09 NHL season when their games moved to Comcast SportsNet California (now NBC Sports California). Over-the-air telecasts aired on KGO 7 from 1991–1994 and on KICU 36 from 1995–1999.

Beginning with the 2020–21 season, the Sharks launched the Sharks Audio Network, a 24-seven digital audio platform that produces audio broadcasts of all San Jose Sharks games along with other Sharks and San Jose Barracuda programming. The audio feed can currently be accessed in the Sharks app or on the team&#x27;s website.

Sharks personalities Dan Rusanowsky, Randy Hahn, Bret Hedican, Drew Remenda, Ted Ramey and Tara Slone all contribute to the network&#x27;s programming. Current Sharks-centric programming includes the &quot;Sharks Morning Skate&quot;, &quot;The Morning Tide with Ted Ramey&quot;, &quot;The Buildup&quot;, and more.

On June 1, 2023, Rusanowsky was announced as the recipient of the 2023 Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, voted on by the NHL Broadcaster&#x27;s Association and presented &quot;in recognition of members of the radio and television industry who made outstanding contributions to their profession and the game during their career in hockey broadcasting&quot;.

==Traditions==

The Sharks&#x27; best-known tradition is their pre-game entrance scene. At the beginning of each Sharks home game, the lights go down and a 17-foot open shark mouth is lowered from the rafters. As the mouth is lowered the eyes flash red and fog pours out. Then, a live view of the locker room tunnel with Sharks players is shown on the scoreboard and the goalie leads the team out of the locker room, through the mouth, and onto the ice. The Sharks currently use &quot;Seek &amp; Destroy&quot; by Metallica as their entrance song. Previous entrance songs include Metallica&#x27;s version of &quot;Breadfan&quot; and &quot;Get Ready for This&quot; by 2 Unlimited. The latter song has been used as the team&#x27;s goal song since 2016.

Any time the Sharks go on the power play, the &quot;Jaws&quot; theme song is played while the fans do &quot;The Chomp&quot;, extending their arms in front and moving them up and down to form a chomping jaw.

Since 2015, the fan-driven supporters club, Teal City Crew, has sit atop sections 217–218, organizing marches to the arena and charity drives and creating tifo related to the games being played, most notably the &quot;retirement&quot; banner for NHL veteran, Mike Hoffman, for his temporary trade to the Sharks, before being later traded that same day to the Florida Panthers.

==Rivalries==
The Sharks have historically had rivalries with the two other California NHL teams, the Anaheim Ducks and the Los Angeles Kings.

<text>The Nashville Predators (colloquially referred to as the Preds) are a professional ice hockey team based in Nashville, Tennessee. The Predators compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division in the Western Conference. The team has played its home games at Bridgestone Arena since 1998. Their television broadcasting rights are held by Bally Sports South, and the Nashville Predators Radio Network flagship station is WPRT-FM. The Predators are currently affiliated with two minor league teams: the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL), and the Atlanta Gladiators of the ECHL.

The club was founded in 1997, when the NHL granted an expansion franchise to Craig Leipold, with the team beginning play in the 1998–99 season. After five seasons, the Predators qualified for their first Stanley Cup playoffs during the 2003–04 season. In 2008, ownership of the team was transferred from Leipold to a locally based ownership group. The Predators advanced to their first Stanley Cup Finals in 2017, but were defeated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games. In the following season, the Predators won their first Presidents&#x27; Trophy and Central Division title.

==History==

===Bringing the NHL to Nashville===
In late 1995, rumors began to circulate that the New Jersey Devils would relocate to the planned Nashville Arena after they won their first-ever Stanley Cup championship. Nashville offered a $20 million relocation bonus to any team that would relocate, and the Devils attempted to terminate their lease with the NJSEA before ultimately restructuring it to remain in New Jersey.
After the failed attempt to land the Devils, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated Nashville would probably be considered in upcoming expansion. The arena was opened in 1996, and after an attempt to bring the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Sacramento Kings did not materialize, the city instead went after a hockey team.

In January 1997, a group led by Wisconsin businessman Craig Leipold made a formal presentation before the NHL requesting an expansion franchise. When Bettman and league officials visited Nashville to tour the arena, thousands gathered on the arena plaza to greet them. In June, the league granted conditional franchises to Nashville, Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta, and Minneapolis–Saint Paul.

The Nashville team would begin play in 1998 if they met the NHL requirement of selling 12,000 season tickets before March 31, 1998. Of the four cities, Nashville was the only one with a completed arena and therefore began play first. On July 9, 1997, Leipold named former Washington Capitals general manager David Poile as the franchise&#x27;s first general manager. Portland Pirates&#x27; head coach Barry Trotz was named the franchise&#x27;s first head coach on August 6.

On September 25, 1997, Leipold and team president Jack Diller held a press conference where they unveiled the franchise&#x27;s new logo, a saber-toothed cat (&quot;Smilodon fatalis&quot;). The logo was a reference to a partial &quot;Smilodon&quot; skeleton found beneath downtown Nashville in 1971 during construction of the First American National Bank building, now the UBS Tower.

Once the logo was unveiled, the franchise held a vote among fans to choose a name. Three candidates were culled from 75: &quot;Ice Tigers&quot;, &quot;Fury&quot; and &quot;Attack&quot;. Leipold added his own submission to the vote, &quot;Predators&quot;. On November 13, Leipold revealed at a press conference that his submission had won out and the new franchise would be known as the &quot;Nashville Predators&quot;.

When awarded a franchise, the city of Nashville paid 31.50% of the $80 million fee to join the league. The city has engaged an affiliate of the team to operate the arena, and that agreement protects the city against annual arena operating losses over approximately $3.8 million. The $15 million payroll of the team was the lowest of the NHL.

===Early years (1998–2005)===
The Predators began play during the 1998–99 season, taking to the ice for the first time on October 10, 1998, where they lost 1–0 at home to the Florida Panthers. It was the only sold-out game of the Predators&#x27; first five bouts in Nashville. Three nights later, on October 13, they defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 3–2 for their first win. Forward Andrew Brunette scored the first goal. The Predators, in their first year of existence, finished second-to-last in the Western Conference with a 28–47–7 record. In the 1999–2000 season, the Predators finished with a similar record to the previous season, and finished last in the Western Conference behind the Calgary Flames. However, during a game versus the New York Islanders on February 20, 2000, the Predators scored four goals in 3 minutes and 38 seconds.

To begin the 2000–01 season, the Predators played two games at the Saitama Super Arena in Tokyo, Japan against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Each team won a game in front of the largest crowds ever to see a hockey game in Japan (13,849 for the first game and 13,426 for the second game). This included around 100 fans who made the trip from Tennessee. Backed by the goaltending duo of Mike Dunham and Tomas Vokoun, Nashville finished the season in tenth place in the Western Conference, ten points out of a playoff spot with a total of 80 total points. During the 2001–02 season, the Predators recorded their 100th victory on December 6, 2001. With that win, Nashville became the second-fastest expansion team of the 1990s to reach the 100-win plateau. In the 2002–03 season, head coach Barry Trotz broke the record for most games coached by the original coach of an expansion team (392 games).

In June 2003, the Predators hosted the NHL entry draft. Future Predators captain Shea Weber was selected by the team with the 49th overall pick.

The club failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs for their first five years as a franchise. However, in the 2003–04 season, the Predators finished eighth in the Western Conference, qualifying for their first postseason berth. The Predators were eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings in six games in the first round of the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs. The following 2004–05 season was wiped out by a labor dispute between NHL owners and players.

===After the lockout (2005–2014)===
The Predators made their biggest free agent signing to that point in August 2005, when they signed Paul Kariya to a two-year, $9 million contract.
In the 2005–06 season, the Predators set an NHL record by winning their first four games by one goal each (although two of those were shootout victories, which would have been tie games in previous seasons). They also became only the fourth NHL franchise to start the season 8–0; the last time a team did so was the Toronto Maple Leafs, who set the mark with a 10–0 start in the 1993–94 season. The Predators set the franchise mark for wins in a season with a 2–0 shutout of the Phoenix Coyotes on March 16, 2006. In that match, Chris Mason became the ninth goaltender to score a goal. By the end of the season, the Predators had accumulated 106 points—their first 100-point season—and clinched home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs for the first time in team history. They finished the season with an NHL-best 32–8–1 record at home. However, the Predators would be eliminated by the San Jose Sharks in five games in the first round of the 2006 playoffs.

During the off-season, the Predators acquired veteran center Jason Arnott from free agency on July 2, 2006. In the following season, Arnott and David Legwand led the team in goals with 27 each. Late in the season, the Predators traded two former first-round draft picks, Scottie Upshall and Ryan Parent, plus their first and third-round pick in the 2007 NHL entry draft, to the Philadelphia Flyers for five-time NHL All-Star Peter Forsberg. The Predators finished the season ranked fourth in the Western Conference with a franchise-record 110 points, finishing third overall behind the Buffalo Sabres and the Red Wings. They were defeated by the Sharks in the first round of the 2007 playoffs for the second year in a row, losing the series 4–1.

The roster saw a depletion in talent during the off-season. With multiple potential buyers and rumors of the franchise moving hounding the team until almost mid-season, the Predators were not expected to be successful during the 2007–08 season. Chris Mason, former backup goaltender to Tomas Vokoun (who was traded to the Florida Panthers) had a shaky season and shared net-minding duties with Dan Ellis. Ellis, who was signed from the Dallas Stars before the season began, had a 233:39 long shutout streak (fifth longest in league history) nearing the end of the season that helped Nashville attain the eighth playoff spot with 91 points. The Predators met the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning (and eventual Stanley Cup winners) Red Wings in the first round of the playoffs and were defeated 4–2, their fourth-straight first-round knockout.

====New ownership group====
The first off-season of settling in under new ownership was a quiet one for the Predators with little personnel movement. As such, the Predators began the 2008–09 season with little expectation. Following a strong push after the All-Star break and no movement at the trade deadline, the team found themselves still battling for a playoff spot into the last week of the season. Buoyed by the return of Steve Sullivan after almost two seasons recovering from a back injury, the Predators finished with 88 points, settling for tenth place in the Western Conference, missing the playoffs for the first time in five seasons.
The Predators made few major additions to their roster in the 2009 off-season, signing former San Jose Sharks forward Marcel Goc (who was extended for another year by the club in mid-season) and former Montreal Canadiens defenseman Francis Bouillon. The 2009–10 season also saw the much-anticipated debut of top prospect Colin Wilson. However, due to a groin injury suffered in training camp, Wilson spent the first week-and-a-half of the season on the sidelines, and was sent to the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL) in November. He returned to the club in February and scored 11 points in his next 15 games and finished the season with 15 points in 35 games. 2010 also saw a breakout year for the last pick in the 2005 draft, Patric Hornqvist, as the 23-year-old Swede scored 30 in the 2009–10 season, becoming the fourth Predator to do so (the others being Steve Sullivan, Paul Kariya and Jason Arnott). The Predators qualified for the 2010 playoffs, facing the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round. The Predators earned their first postseason road win on April 16, 2010, when they beat the Blackhawks 4–1 at the United Center, although they lost the overall series in six games.

On July 9, 2010, the Predators announced defenseman Shea Weber would become the club&#x27;s fifth captain. In the following years&#x27; playoffs, the Predators advanced to the second round of the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. They defeated the Anaheim Ducks in the first round, winning the fourth game of the series at Bridgestone Arena on April 24, 2011. Two days prior, Predators&#x27; goaltender Pekka Rinne was nominated as a Vezina Trophy finalist for his performance during the 2010–11 season. The Predators played against the number-one ranked team in the NHL in the second round, the Vancouver Canucks. The Predators lost the series 4–2.

On June 22, 2011, the Predators unveiled their modified logo set for the 2011–12 season. With the color scheme simplified to blue, gold, and white and eliminating orange, silver, and steel, the Predators cleaned up their primary logo and wordmark. A new alternate logo incorporating elements from a guitar pick and the Tennessee state flag was also introduced. Home jerseys changed from blue to gold.

In the beginning of the 2011–12 season, on November 3, 2011, the Predators signed goaltender Pekka Rinne to a seven-year, $49 million deal. It was the largest contract awarded in Predators&#x27; history, as well as making Rinne the highest-paid goaltender in the NHL that year. On February 27, 2012, during the NHL&#x27;s trade deadline, the Predators acquired Andrei Kostitsyn and Paul Gaustad from the Montreal Canadiens and the Buffalo Sabres, respectively. The Predators surrendered draft picks to bolster their team for the 2012 playoffs. The season also saw the return of Russian forward Alexander Radulov to the Predators after a four-year hiatus to play in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). For the second year in a row, and the second time in the team&#x27;s history, the Predators won a first-round series in the Stanley Cup playoffs, defeating the Red Wings in a best-of-seven series 4–1. However, for the second year in a row, the Predators were ousted in the Western Conference second round, this time to the Phoenix Coyotes.
The following 2012–13 season was shortened to 48 games as a result of the 2012–13 NHL lockout. The Predators failed to qualify for the playoffs in the shortened season, the first time they failed to do so since the 2008–09 season. After the season, the Predators signed Weber through a front-loaded $110 million, 14-year offer sheet, $68 million of it as a signing bonus, from the Philadelphia Flyers on July 19. The offer sheet was the richest in NHL history in terms of total money, money per season, and length, surpassing the previous offer sheet record set by Thomas Vanek.

The following season saw the departure of center David Legwand, the first player ever drafted by the Predators, the club&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, and was co-leading scorer for the season at the time. Agreeing to waive his &quot;no-trade clause&quot;, he was traded on March 5, 2014, to his hometown team, the Detroit Red Wings, in exchange for prospect forward Calle Jarnkrok, forward Patrick Eaves and a third-round pick in the upcoming 2014 NHL entry draft. After missing the playoffs for the second season in a row, the Predators opted not to renew the contract of Barry Trotz as their head coach after 15 years, although he was offered an unnamed position within the organization. On May 6, 2014, the Predators announced Peter Laviolette as their new head coach.

===Peter Laviolette era (2014–2020)===

====Regaining consistency (2014–2016)====
In Peter Laviolette&#x27;s first season as the Predators&#x27; head coach, the Predators finished second in the Central Division. Despite having home advantage in the first round of the 2015 playoffs, they lost the first round in six games to the Chicago Blackhawks, who went on to win the Stanley Cup. For the following 2015–16 season, the Predators name Sean Henry CEO and then finished as the Western Conference&#x27;s first wild-card, earning 96 points. When they advanced to the second round after beating the Anaheim Ducks in game 7, it was the franchise&#x27;s first seven-game series and seven-game series win. They were eliminated in seven games by the San Jose Sharks, who went on to win the conference.

The Predators hosted the 2016 National Hockey League All-Star Game at Bridgestone Arena.
In the 2016 off-season, on June 29, 2016, the Predators traded Weber to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for defenseman P. K. Subban. The trade surprised many hockey fans because the details to this trade were kept strictly confidential until the deal was already made. On September 7, 2016, the Predators announced Mike Fisher would replace Weber as the sixth captain of the club.

====First Stanley Cup Finals appearance and first Presidents&#x27; Trophy (2016–2018)====
In the 2016–17 season, the Predators finished fourth in the Central Division with 94 points, which earned them the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference. The 2016–17 season marked the first time the Predators sold out all 41 regular season home games. Their eighth-place finish in the conference gave them a first-round Stanley Cup playoff matchup against the Chicago Blackhawks, who finished first in the conference during the regular season.

The Predators swept the Blackhawks in four games. This was the first time an eighth seed swept a playoff series against the top seed in the conference in NHL history as well as the first time that there had been a sweep by an eighth seed against a top seed in a best-of-seven playoff series in the history of North American major league professional sports. In the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Predators defeated the St. Louis Blues in six games, marking the first time the team advanced to the conference finals. On May 16, the Predators became the first team in 20 years (since the Detroit Red Wings in 1997) to achieve 10 straight wins at home in the postseason. On May 22, 2017, the Predators defeated the Anaheim Ducks 6–3 and won the series four games to two, winning the Western Conference, and advancing to the club&#x27;s first Stanley Cup Finals. In the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals, the Predators went down 2–0 against the Penguins before battling back and leveling the series at two, winning games 3 and 4 at home. Returning to Pittsburgh, the Predators lost 6–0 before being eliminated at home 2–0 in game 6.

On April 5, 2018, the Predators clinched their first division title in team history while also claiming their first Presidents&#x27; Trophy. They defeated the Colorado Avalanche in the first round of the playoffs in six games, and then lost to the Winnipeg Jets in seven games in the second round.

====Early playoff exits (2018–2020)====
The next season saw the Predators clinch their second consecutive division title, but lost to the Dallas Stars in the first round of the 2019 playoffs.

The Predators played in their first outdoor game at the 2020 Winter Classic, facing the Dallas Stars at the Cotton Bowl.

The Predators fired head coach Laviolette on January 6, 2020, with the team sitting at sixth place in the division at the time and a record of 19–15–7.

===John Hynes era (2020–23)===

====Continued playoff struggles (2020–23)====
On January 7, 2020, John Hynes was hired as the third head coach in the Predators&#x27; franchise history. In Hynes&#x27; first game as coach, Pekka Rinne became the second Predators goaltender to score a goal in a 5–2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. The team&#x27;s season would come to an abrupt end two months later when the league suspended operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Predators advanced to the 2020 playoffs, but were defeated by the Arizona Coyotes in the qualifying round. The Predators returned to the playoffs in 2021, but were defeated by the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round.

The Predators hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning at Nissan Stadium in their second outdoor game, the 2022 Stadium Series, on February 26, 2022, losing 3–2 in front of a crowd of 68,619. They clinched the 2022 playoffs, but were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche in the first round.

In February 2023, David Poile announced that he would retire as general manager of the team at the end of the 2022–23 season, and that former head coach Barry Trotz would succeed him, effective June 30, 2023.

===Andrew Brunette era (2023–present)===
On May 31, 2023, Trotz announced that the team had hired former player Andrew Brunette as the fourth head coach in franchise history. In the 2023–24 season, the Predators finished as the first wildcard, but lost to the Vancouver Canucks in six games in the first round of the 2024 playoffs.

====Free agent acquisitions====
On the first day of free agency in 2024, the Nashville Predators spent $108.5 million signing three high calibre free-agents: Jonathan Marchessault (5 years, 27.5 million), Brady Skjei (7 years, 49 million), and, as a shock to the entire sports world, Tampa Bay Lightning 2-time Stanley cup winning captain and full-career veteran of 16 years with the team, Steven Stamkos. This is widely considered the most successful off-season in Nashville Predators history &quot;on paper&quot;, although, due to some struggles of these free-agents in the early to mid-season that affected Nashville&#x27;s playoff odds, some may call it the &quot;worst&quot; off-season in the history of the franchise.

==Team information==

===Facilities===

The Nashville Predators have played their home games at Bridgestone Arena since their inaugural season in 1998. Opened in 1996, Bridgestone Arena is a multi-purpose venue in downtown Nashville.

===Fan traditions===
Fans of the Nashville Predators have modified the octopus-throwing tradition of Detroit Red Wings fans to show their support: on occasion, a fan will throw a catfish onto the ice. &quot;The Tennessean&quot; newspaper of Nashville cites the first instance of this as being on October 30, 2003. On May 16, 2017, during game 3 of the conference finals at Bridgestone Arena, country music singer, songwriter, and record producer Keith Urban, who had performed the national anthem prior to the game, was seen on the Jumbotron hoisting a massive catfish that Tennessee Titans left tackle, Taylor Lewan had with him at the game. Lewan, along with fellow Titans offensive linemen Jack Conklin, Quinton Spain, Ben Jones, and Josh Klein, and Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota, served as the hype men prior to the game, another Predators playoff tradition prior to home games, which included them waving gold Predators towels, Mariota encouraging the crowd to get louder, Lewan hoisting the catfish, and the offensive linemen chugging beer.

Section 303 is where a section of fans at the Bridgestone Arena sit, stand, and cheer, colloquially known as &quot;The Cellblock&quot;. The group refers to themselves as &quot;the loudest section of the loudest arena in the NHL.&quot; The fan-based organization has been recognized by the Predators&#x27; front office. A large banner was produced by the front office for posting on the wall behind the section.

On April 3, 2008, with the Predators clinging to a 3–2 lead with 4:30 in their final home game of the regular season, a sellout crowd at what was then known as the Sommet Center, gave the team a standing ovation through the entirety of the final TV timeout. The Predators went on to win the game against the St. Louis Blues and advanced to the playoffs that year, where the &quot;standing O&quot; during the final TV timeout has since become a fan tradition.

The mascot of the Predators is Gnash, a blue saber-toothed cat. Introduced in 1998, Gnash&#x27;s trademark includes stunts, such as very fast rappels, zip lines, and a pendulum swing that takes him under the scoreboard and just inches off the ice. To go along with the saber-toothed cat mascot, Predators fans proudly use their &quot;Fang Fingers&quot; during each power play of the game. There are foam saber-fang gloves that can be purchased, but most fans simply curl their index and middle fingers on each hand into fang shapes and brandish them in an up-and-down motion. Fang Fingers are done to the horror sounds from the Alfred Hitchcock movie, &quot;Psycho&quot;.

Fans are also known for a variety of chants taunting players of the opposing team, particularly the goalie. For example, after each Predators goal, fans call the opposing goalie&#x27;s name, accompanied by shouts of &quot;It&#x27;s all your fault&quot; and other epithets. These cheers are sometimes said to originate from tradition at college football games, but some of these derive from traditions held by fans of Nashville&#x27;s former pre-NHL hockey teams Nashville Dixie Flyers, Nashville South Stars, Nashville Knights, and Nashville Nighthawks/Nashville Ice Flyers. This has contributed to the team also being called &quot;Smashville&quot;.

===Jersey and logo===

The original Predators uniforms were worn from 1998 to 2007 and both featured a silver yoke on the shoulder. Navy and white were the base uniform colors while gold was used only as an accent color. The white uniforms featured the primary Predators logo outside a navy triangle while the navy uniforms use the same logo minus the triangle. From 1998 to 2004 the secondary logo featuring the Gaylord Entertainment Center (now Bridgestone Arena) tower adorned the shoulders.

From 2001 to 2007 the Predators wore mustard gold third jerseys featuring the front-facing saber-toothed cat logo. These jerseys are known by the nickname &quot;Mustard Cats.&quot; The logo then replaced the tower alternate logo on the shoulders of their primary uniforms in 2005.

Switching to Reebok&#x27;s Edge template in 2007, the Predators made minor tweaks to their uniforms. Most notably, the white uniforms no longer featured a contrasting nameplate color, while the city name was added above the Predators logo.

From 2009 to 2011, the Predators wore navy third jerseys but with black replacing gold as trim color. A roundel logo featuring the fossilized cat adorned the shoulders while a checkerboard pattern of black and navy squares adorned the sleeves, tail stripes and socks.

For the 2011–12 season, the Nashville Predators changed their jersey design and color scheme. The home jerseys are a bright gold with navy and white highlights, while the away jerseys are white with gold and navy highlights. Furthermore, the Predators changed their logo, making it purely white, gold and navy. The jerseys have a guitar pick on the shoulder with the Tennessee state tri-star inside it, lines reminiscent of guitar strings on the numbers, and piano keys along the neckline inside the jersey as a nod to Nashville&#x27;s internationally known music heritage. From the 2016–17 season gold helmets became a permanent part of the home uniform, after they first used them on Saturday home games the prior season.

In the 2017–18 season the Predators changed their uniform style to fit with the new Adidas template. While the gold home uniforms received minimal alterations, the away white uniforms featured more gold accents in the sleeves, shoulders and tail while navy was relegated to trim color.

The Predators unveiled a special edition uniform for the 2020 Winter Classic, featuring a design inspired from the uniforms of the defunct EHL team Nashville Dixie Flyers. Heavy gold stripes with navy trim adorn the chest and sleeves while a script rendition of the team name was inserted to the gold chest stripe. A navy felt-rendered saber-toothed cat logo was also added on the left shoulder.

In the 2020–21 season, the Predators released a special &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; alternate uniform, using the design they wore from 1998 to 2007. However, gold was used as the base color while navy was relegated to trim color.

For the 2022 Stadium Series, the Predators released a navy uniform with a thick gold stripe in front. The &quot;Smashville&quot; moniker in large navy letters along with the navy &quot;guitar pick&quot; alternate logo was emblazoned inside the gold stripe. Numbers were enlarged for visibility purposes.

A second &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; uniform was released in the 2022–23 season, using the 2001 to 2007 alternate uniform but with the current athletic gold in place of mustard gold.

===Mascot===
The mascot of the team is an anthropomorphic saber-toothed tiger named Gnash.

===Ownership===
The franchise was initially owned by a group led by Craig Leipold. On May 23, 2007, Leipold was reported to have reached a tentative agreement to sell the team to Research in Motion chairman and co-CEO Jim Balsillie. At the time, Leipold indicated that the team would play the 2007–08 season in Nashville but that the future of the team after that was not clear.

On June 23, information leaked by several sources indicated that Leipold no longer wanted to sell the Predators to Balsillie. Subsequently, a campaign to land the team in Kansas City, Missouri, received a boost in late June 2007. The Canadian &quot;National Post&quot;, citing anonymous sources, reported that Leipold planned to sell the team to San Jose venture capitalist William &quot;Boots&quot; Del Biaggio III, who wanted to relocate the club to Kansas City&#x27;s new Sprint Center for the 2008–09 season. Del Biaggio, who had a contract with Anschutz Entertainment Group to own an NHL club that would play home games in Sprint Center, had made an offer reported to be for about $190 million for the Predators. Del Biaggio had entered an agreement two years earlier, in 2005, to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins, but the club backed out of the deal after it won that year&#x27;s NHL draft lottery and took Sidney Crosby with the first overall pick.

On July 19, 2007, a group of local business owners known as Our Team Nashville held a rally at the Sommet Center to encourage fans to buy season tickets in order to help the Predators meet the attendance figures needed to keep the team in Nashville. They drew approximately 7,500 fans and sold the equivalent of 726 full-season tickets during the rally. The rally was heavily supported by George Plaster, then a sportscaster on WGFX 104.5 &quot;The Zone&quot; sports radio in Nashville. On August 1, 2007, the group released a letter of intent from Craig Leipold. After negotiations with the City of Nashville, the local group headed by David Freeman reached an agreement with Nashville Mayor Karl Dean, and the NHL Board of Governors approved the sale on November 29, 2007.

In June 2008, Del Biaggio ran into legal trouble over a multitude of unpaid loans, culminating in his filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Furthermore, it was alleged that Del Biaggio acquired the loans he used to buy his stake in the team through fraudulent means, prompting an FBI investigation and criminal charges. The charges culminated in a 97-month prison sentence for Del Biaggio. Under United States bankruptcy law, a trustee was appointed to sell Del Biaggio&#x27;s assets, including his stake in the Predators, to pay off his creditors. In November 2011, it was announced that Calgary businessman W. Brett Wilson had purchased a 5% interest in the Nashville Predators.

On March 1, 2010, during the 2009–10 season, the Predators front office saw Freeman step down as chairman of the Nashville Predators in favor of Thomas Cigarran. On September 2, Cigarran announced that the local ownership group had completed the purchase of the Del Biaggio stake.

====Ownership dispute====
On June 23, 2016, Freeman filed a $250 million lawsuit against the Nashville Predators and Cigarran. His claim was that his ownership stake has been improperly diluted by Cigarran failing to notify him of capital calls, and that he had not received loan guaranty fees that the ownership group had agreed to pay him. The lawsuit stated that Freeman initially owned a 48% share, while the holding company for the Nashville Predators stated that Freeman controlled less than 1% of ownership in the team at the time of the suit. This dilution was exacerbated by the existence of two classes of investments in the Predators: the common units owned by Freeman were subject to capital calls; the Series A units originally owned by Del Biaggio and his minority partner were not subject to capital calls.

The dispute was sent to court-ordered arbitration on July 29, 2016, under the supervision of NHL commissioner Gary Bettman. As of January 25, 2018, arbitration was continuing in the unresolved dispute. The outcome may remain undisclosed, as the arbitration is private.

====Bill Haslam purchases majority stake====
On June 17, 2022, the Predators announced that former Governor of Tennessee Bill Haslam would purchase shares in the club and become majority owner over the course of several years. Haslam&#x27;s brother, Jimmy Haslam, is the owner of the Cleveland Browns and the Columbus Crew.

===Broadcasters===
Local television rights of Predators games are held by FanDuel Sports Network South (formerly Bally Sports South), with its territory covering Tennessee, Georgia, most of Kentucky, northern Mississippi and northern Alabama. Radio coverage is carried by the Nashville Predators Radio Network, whose flagship station is WPRT-FM.

<text>Bruno Bauer (; ; 6 September 180913 April 1882) was a German philosopher and theologian. As a student of G. W. F. Hegel, Bauer was a radical Rationalist in philosophy, politics and Biblical criticism. Bauer investigated the sources of the New Testament and, beginning with Hegel&#x27;s analysis of Christianity&#x27;s Hellenic as well as Jewish roots, concluded that early Christianity owed more to ancient Greek philosophy (Stoicism) than to Judaism.

Bauer is also known for his association and sharp break with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and for his later association with Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche. Starting in 1840, he began a series of works arguing that Jesus of Nazareth was a 2nd-century fusion of Jewish, Greek, and Roman theology.

== Biography ==
Bauer was born on 6 September 1809 at Eisenberg in Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. In 1815, Bauer&#x27;s father got a job as a painter in a porcelain factory in Charlottenburg and the family moved to Berlin. From 1828 to 1834 Bauer studied at the University of Berlin under Hegel, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Heinrich Gustav Hotho, and Phillip Marheineke. While at the university, Bauer&#x27;s 1829 essay on Immanuel Kant&#x27;s aesthetics won the Prussian royal prize in philosophy on Hegel&#x27;s recommendation.

He became associated with the &quot;Right Hegelians&#x27;&quot; under Marheineke, who engaged Bauer years later to edit the second edition of Hegel&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion&quot; (1818-1832)&quot;.

From 1834 to 1839 Bauer taught theological and biblical texts in Berlin. In 1838 he published his (Critical Exhibition of the Religion of the Old Testament) in two volumes.

However, in 1839 he was transferred to the University of Bonn after publishing an attack on his former teacher Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg.

Consistent with his Hegelian Rationalism, Bauer continued in 1840 with, (Critique of the Evangelical History of John). In 1841 Bauer continued his Rationalist theme with, (&quot;Critique of the Evangelical History of the Synoptics&quot;).

From 1839 to 1841, Bauer was a teacher, mentor and close friend of Karl Marx, but in 1841 they came to a break. Marx, with Friedrich Engels, had formulated a socialist and communistic program that Bauer firmly rejected. Marx and Engels in turn expressed their break with Bauer in two books: &quot;The Holy Family&quot; (1845) and &quot;The German Ideology&quot; (1846).

He was dismissed from the University of Bonn in 1842 due to his unorthodox writings on the New Testament. At no time in his writing was Bauer ever an orthodox Christian.

He was called a &quot;Right Hegelian&quot; by his contemporary David Strauss. (cf. David Strauss, &quot;In Defense of My &#x27;Life of Jesus&#x27; Against the Hegelians&quot;, 1838). Also, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels accused Bauer of being a right-wing fanatic in their book
&quot;The Holy Family: Against Bruno Bauer and Co.&quot; (1845), and in &quot;The German Ideology&quot; (1846). Further, several scholars (e.g., Dr. Lawrence Stepelevich) still maintain that Bauer&#x27;s book, &quot;Trumpet of the Last Judgment Against Hegel the Atheist and Antichrist&quot; (1841), was a genuinely right-wing production.

Despite this, Bauer was much later accused of being a &quot;Left Hegelian&quot; because of his association, or rather his early leadership, of the Young Hegelians. The labels of &#x27;Left&#x27; and &#x27;Right&#x27; were only placed on Bauer by others; never by himself.

The Prussian Minister of Education, Altenstein, sent Bauer to the University of Bonn, to protect his Rationalist Theology from the critique of the Berlin orthodox, as well as to win over Bonn University to Hegelianism. Bauer, however, created many enemies at pietist-dominated Bonn University, where he openly taught Rationalism in his new position as professor of theology. Bauer attested in letters during this time that he tried to provoke a scandal, to force the government either to give complete freedom of research and teaching to its university professors or to openly express its anti-enlightenment position by removing him from his post.

The pro-Hegelian minister Altenstein died in 1840 and was replaced by the anti-Hegelian Eichhorn. The government officials asked for advice from the theology departments of its universities. Except for the Hegelian Marheineke, most said that a professor of Protestant theology should not be allowed to teach &quot;atheism&quot; to his student priests. As Bauer was unwilling to compromise his Rationalism, the Prussian government in 1842 revoked his teaching license. After the setbacks of the revolutions of 1848, Bauer left the city. He lived an ascetic and stoic life in the countryside of Rixdorf near Berlin.

Bauer continued to write, including more than nine theological tomes, in twelve volumes. The tomes varied between theology, modern history and politics. He wrote while working at his family&#x27;s tobacco shop.

Between 1843 and 1845, Bauer published (&quot;History of Politics, Culture and Enlightenment in the 18th Century&quot;, in 4 volumes). In 1847 Bauer published (&quot;History of the French Revolution&quot;, in 3 volumes). Between 1850 and 1852 Bauer published (&quot;A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin&quot;), as well as (&quot;Critique of the Pauline Epistles&quot;).

In 1877 Bauer published (&quot;Christ and the Caesars&quot;), and in 1882 he published (&quot;Disraeli&#x27;s Romantic and Bismarck&#x27;s Socialist Imperialism&quot;).

Bauer&#x27;s final book on theology, &quot;Christ and the Caesars&quot; (1879), was his crowning effort to justify Hegel&#x27;s position that Christian theology owed at least as much to Greco-Roman classical philosophy as it owed to Judaism.

Bauer died at Rixdorf in 1882.

== Conflict with David Strauss ==
Shortly after the death of Hegel, another writer, David Strauss, who had been a reader of Hegel&#x27;s writings, arrived in Berlin (1831). As a student of Friedrich Schleiermacher he wrote a controversial book which is now famous, entitled, &quot;The Life of Jesus Critically Examined&quot;, usually referred to as &quot;The Life of Jesus&quot; (1835). In this book, David Strauss announced his own landmark theory of &#x27;demythologization&#x27; as an approach to the Gospels, but he also attempted to use Hegel&#x27;s name and fame in the dedication of his book.

In the year of its publication, Strauss&#x27;s book raised a storm of controversy. The Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm IV tightened control of the Prussian University system, favouring an ultra-conservative approach to the New Testament. He strongly objected to the writing of David Strauss, and so he also blamed the Hegelian school in general, partly because Strauss had named Hegel in his dedication.

Bauer, now 26 years old, was chosen by the Hegelians to refute David Strauss in the Hegelian (&quot;Journal of Philosophical Criticism&quot;). Bauer demonstrated that Strauss had thoroughly misrepresented Hegel. Bauer also demonstrated that David Strauss&#x27; dialectic was taken from Schleiermacher (who was antagonistic toward Hegel).

Although Strauss&#x27;s book had sold well throughout Europe, in 1838 Strauss published a rebuttal to Bauer in a booklet entitled, &quot;In Defense of my Life of Jesus against the Hegelians&quot; (1838). In that book, Strauss admitted publicly that his position had not been inspired by Hegel&#x27;s philosophy or theology (with his dialectical Trinity). This firmly divorced Strauss of the Hegelian philosophy.

However, in this final exchange with the Hegelians, David Strauss criticized Bauer in invented terms still in use today. Bauer was a Right Hegelian he claimed, as an insult, who uncritically defended all positions of orthodox Christian theology. His own views, claimed Strauss, were Left Hegelian which, like Hegel, take a liberal and progressive approach to Scripture. The terms were made famous by Marx and Engels, who used them in their own battle against the anticommunist Bauer. Actually, Bauer never accepted those terms. Strauss had already admitted he was not a student of Hegel.

The Prussian monarch, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, an orthodox Christian, strongly objected to David Strauss, but considered Bauer&#x27;s defense to be just as bad, so he banned many Hegelians from teaching in Universities, including Bauer. For the rest of his life, Bauer continued to be bitter towards Strauss, and the elderly Bauer encouraged a young Friedrich Nietzsche to write articles sharply critical of Strauss. Nietzsche during this early period called Bauer, &quot;[his] entire reading public!&quot;

== Views on Christian origins ==
Bauer wrote a criticism of the New Testament. David Strauss, in his &quot;Life of Jesus&quot;, had accounted for the Gospel narratives as half-conscious products of the mythic instinct in the early Christian communities. Bauer challenged Strauss&#x27; notion that a community could produce such a marvelously connected narrative as the first Gospel. Rather, he believed only a single writer could be responsible for the first Gospel. 

Bauer was one of the architects of the theory of Marcan Priority which remains the predominant approach to Gospel writings among scholars today, i.e., that the Gospel of Mark was the first Gospel written and the other Gospels merely added on to Mark&#x27;s Gospel. Bauer promoted the other two major architects of this theory, namely, Christian Hermann Weisse &quot;Die evangelische Geschichte, kritisch und philosophisch bearbeitet&quot; (&quot;The Gospel History, Critically and Philosophically Reviewed&quot;, 1838) and Christian Gottlob Wilke (Der Urevangelist oder exegetisch kritische Untersuchung über das Verwandtschaftsverhältniß der drei ersten Evangelien (The First Evangelist, Exegetical Critical Study on the Relationship of the First Three Gospels, 1838). 

For Bauer, our current Gospel of Mark was completed in the reign of Hadrian (117–138 CE), although its prototype, the &#x27;Ur-Marcus&#x27; (identifiable within the Gospel of Mark by critical analysis), was begun before the time of Josephus and the Roman–Jewish Wars (66-70 CE). 

In 1906 Albert Schweitzer wrote that Bauer originally sought &quot;to save the honor of Jesus and to restore His Person from the state of inanity to which the apologists had reduced it...to bring Him into a living relation with history.&quot; However, he eventually came to believe that the Gospel was largely fiction and &quot;regarded the Gospel of Mark not only as the first narrator, but even as the creator of the Gospel, thus making Christianity largely the invention of the single original evangelist&quot; (Otto Pfleiderer).

Although Bauer investigated the &#x27;Ur-Marcus&#x27;, it was his remarks on the current version of the Gospel of Mark that captured popular attention. In particular, some key themes in the Gospel of Mark appeared to be literary. 

The Messianic Secret theme, for example, in which Jesus continually performed wonders and told witnesses never to tell anybody, seemed to Bauer to be an example of fiction. If so, Bauer wrote, the redactor who added that theme was probably the final redactor of our current version of the Gospel of Mark. In 1901, Wilhelm Wrede confirmed this in his own book, &quot;Das Messiasgeheimnis in den Evangelien&quot; (English: &quot;The Messianic Secret&quot;, 1901).

For some influential theologians in the Tübingen School, several Pauline epistles were regarded as forgeries of the 2nd century. Bauer radicalized that position by suggesting that all Pauline epistles were forgeries written in the West in antagonism to the Paul of &quot;The Acts&quot;. Bauer observed a preponderance of the Greco-Roman element over the Jewish element in Christian writings, and he added a wealth of historical background to support his theory. However, modern scholars such as E. P. Sanders and John P. Meier have disputed the theory and attempted to demonstrate a mainly Jewish historical background. Other authors, such as Rudolf Bultmann, agreed that a Greco-Roman element was dominant.

According to Schweitzer, Bauer took the position that the writer of Mark&#x27;s gospel was &quot;an Italian, at home both in Rome and Alexandria&quot;; Matthew&#x27;s gospel was written by &quot;a Roman, nourished by the spirit of Seneca&quot;; and Christianity is essentially &quot;Stoicism triumphant in a Jewish garb&quot; (ibid, Schweitzer).

Bauer added a deep review of European literature in the 1st century. In his estimation, many key themes of the New Testament (especially those that are opposed to themes in the Old Testament), can be found with relative ease in Greco-Roman literature that flourished during the 1st century. Such a position was also maintained by some Jewish scholars.

Bauer&#x27;s final book, &quot;Christ and the Caesars&quot; (1879) offers an analysis that shows common keywords in the texts of 1st-century writers like Seneca the Stoic and The New Testament. While that had been perceived even in ancient times, the ancient explanation was that Seneca was a secret Christian. Bauer was the first to attempt to demonstrate carefully that some New Testament writers freely borrowed from Seneca. One modern explanation is that common cultures share common thought forms and common patterns of speech, and similarities do not necessarily indicate borrowing.

In &quot;Christ and the Caesars&quot;, Bauer argued that Judaism entered Rome during the era of the Maccabees and increased in population and influence in Rome since then. He cited literature from the 1st century to strengthen his case that Jewish influence in Rome was far greater than historians had yet reported. The imperial throne was influenced by the Jewish religious genius, he said, citing Herod&#x27;s relation with the Caesar family, as well as the famous relationship between Josephus and the Flavians, Vespasian and Titus. Also, a poem by Horace relates his greeting his Roman friend on a Saturday on his way to the local Synagogue.

According to Bauer, Julius Caesar sought to interpret his own life as an Oriental miracle story, and Augustus Caesar completed that job by commissioning Virgil to write his &quot;Aeneid&quot;, making Caesar into the Son of Venus and a relative of the Trojans, thereby justifying the Roman conquest of Greece and insinuating Rome into a much older history.

By contrast, said Bauer, Vespasian was far more fortunate since he had Josephus himself to link his reign with an Oriental miracle. Josephus had prophesied that Vespasian would become Emperor of Rome and thus ruler of the world. Since that actually came true, it smoothly insinuated Rome into Jewish history. After this, the Roman conquest of Judea would take on new historical dimensions.

According to Albert Schweitzer, Bauer&#x27;s criticisms of the New Testament provided the most interesting questions about the historical Jesus that he had seen.

The second-last chapter of his &quot;Quest&quot; suggests that Schweitzer&#x27;s own theology was partly based on Bauer&#x27;s writings. The title of that chapter is &quot;Thoroughgoing Skepticism and Eschatology&quot; in which Schweitzer clashes head-on with Wilhelm Wrede, who had recently (in 1905) proposed the theory of a Messianic Secret. Wrede&#x27;s theory claimed that Jesus&#x27;s continual commands to his followers to &quot;say nothing to anybody&quot; after each miracle was performed could be explained only as a literary invention of this Gospel writer. (That is, Wrede was the thoroughgoing sceptic, and Schweitzer was the thoroughgoing eschatologist.) Schweitzer began by showing that Wrede had merely copied the idea from Bauer. Then, he listed another forty brilliant criticisms from Bauer (pp. 334–335) and disagreed with some of them (such as the so-called Messianic Secret) and considered others indispensable for any modern theology of the Gospel.

That line of criticism has value in emphasizing the importance of studying the influence of the environment in the formation of the Christian Scriptures. Bauer was a man of restless creativity, interdisciplinary activity and independent judgment. Many reviewers have charged that Bauer&#x27;s judgment was ill-balanced. Because of the controversial nature of his work as a social theorist, theologian and historian, Bauer was banned from public teaching by a Prussian monarch. After many years of similar censorship, Bauer came to resign himself to his place as a freelance critic, rather than an official teacher.

Douglas Moggach published &quot;The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer&quot; in 2003. It is the most comprehensive overview of Bauer&#x27;s life and works in English to date. Bauer&#x27;s biography has now obtained more kindly reviews, even by opponents. In his own day, his opponents often respected him since he was not afraid of taking a line on principle. The topic of Bauer&#x27;s personal religious views or lack thereof is a continuing debate in contemporary scholarship about Bauer.

One modern writer, Paul Trejo, has made the case that Bauer remained a radical theologian who only criticized specific &quot;types&quot; of Christianity and that Bauer maintained a Hegelian interpretation of Christianity throughout his life. According to Trejo, Bauer&#x27;s allegedly radical book &quot;Christianity Exposed&quot; (1843) was actually mild, setting only one large sect of Christianity against another.

Trejo also wrote that Bauer&#x27;s &quot;Trumpet of the Last Judgment against Hegel the Atheist and Antichrist&quot; was merely a comedy, actually a prank, in which Bauer pretended to be a right-wing cleric attacking Hegel. The prank worked, wrote Trejo, and Bauer had a great laugh at the expense of anti-Hegelian clerics. Bauer was a legitimate Christian of the Hegelian school, wrote Trejo, who opposed only the &quot;ingenuous&quot; or &quot;literalist type&quot; of Christianity.

== Antisemitism ==
Beginning in 1848, critics accused Bauer of promoting virulent antisemitism in print within reactionary circles. Bauer&#x27;s view of Jews and Judaism is considered by some to have been absolutely negative, both when considering the past and when contemplating the present.

Others, like Trejo, argue that the charge is spurious, supposedly promoted by “neo-Marxists” who wish to deflect charges of Marx&#x27;s own Anti-Semitism, despite Marx coming from a Jewish family and personally criticising Bauer’s Anti-Semitic claims throughout his written response.

In 1843, Bauer wrote &quot;The Jewish Question&quot;, which was responded to in a pamphlet written by Karl Marx, entitled, &quot;On the Jewish Question&quot;. According to Marx, Bauer argued that the Jews were responsible for their own misfortunes in European society since they had &quot;made their nest in the pores and interstices of bourgeois society&quot;.

Jacob Katz contextualizes Bauer&#x27;s antisemitism with his passionate anti-Christianity, the latter of which caused Bauer to lose his professorship. Although, according to Katz, Bauer was &quot;equally impatient with Christianity and Judaism&quot;, Bauer would frequently diverge from a review or opinion piece on a Jewish writer or thinker into a general consideration of &quot;the Jew as a type&quot;, grasping at whatever negative characteristics he could find.

Others, like Trejo, write that Bauer is widely accused of being a &quot;passionate anti-Christian&quot; on the one hand, and is also widely accused of being a right-wing Christian on the other hand. Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, for example, wrote two books against Bauer, ridiculing him as a right-wing Hegelian. There&#x27;s no shortage of scholars, further, who join translator Lawrence Stepelevich in claiming that Bauer&#x27;s publication, the &#x27;Trumpet of the Last Judgment Against Hegel the Atheist and Antichrist&#x27; (1841) was an earnestly right-wing Christian protest against Hegel. The histories of Bauer are inconsistent and self-contradictory.

A few scholars accuse Bauer of anti-Semitism, e.g. David Leopold&#x27;s article, &quot;The Hegelian Antisemitism of Bruno Bauer.&quot; argues that Hegel and Bauer were &quot;both&quot; anti-Semites. Actually, Bauer&#x27;s 1863 booklet, &quot;Judaism Abroad&quot; (), did remark that Jewish readers should wait for their rights in Germany until the average German received his rights.

== Political ideology ==
The first English-language rendering of Bauer&#x27;s career was published in March 2003 by Douglas Moggach, a professor at the University of Ottawa. His book is entitled, &quot;The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer&quot;. Moggach develops a republican interpretation of Bauer, in which Bauer is portrayed as reaching atheist conclusions because of his political commitments to free self-consciousness and autonomy, and his criticisms of the Restoration union of church and state. Other scholars continue to dispute that portrait.

Bauer was very hard to classify politically, being claimed by both the left and right-wing Hegelians.

During Bauer&#x27;s direct studies under Hegel, he was awarded an academic prize when he was about 20 years old. Hegel died when Bauer was 22 years old. Perhaps this affected Bauer&#x27;s personality; he may have seen himself as sitting quite close to the highest academic post in Prussia, and that might have gone to his head.

When Hegel unexpectedly died in 1831, possibly of cholera, Bauer&#x27;s official connections were drastically reduced. Bauer had few powerful friends during the fallout of Hegel&#x27;s death, as shown by the fact that Bauer and many Hegelians lost their beloved University positions during that decade. The struggle with David Strauss and especially with the Prussian monarchy had set Bauer back quite a bit. This also affected Bauer&#x27;s personality.

Bauer went underground and began to write Hegelian newspapers here and there. In this journey he met some socialists, including Karl Marx, his former student, and Marx&#x27;s new friends, Friedrich Engels and Arnold Ruge. They were all left-wing radicals. Bauer was not a left-wing radical, but he was happy to be their leader if it could lead them back to a Hegelian understanding of the dialectic. Another member of those Young Hegelians, Max Stirner, became Bauer&#x27;s lifelong friend. Although Bauer was not a radical egoist, he preferred the company of Stirner to that of Marx, Engels and Ruge, whom he abandoned -- and who abandoned him.

The two new works by Marx and Engels that were critical of several Young Hegelians, including Bauer, were &quot;The Holy Family&quot;, and &quot;The German Ideology&quot;.

Bauer met with Marx again in London in the mid-1850s, while visiting his exiled brother Edgar there. According to Marx&#x27;s correspondence with Engels, Bauer presented him with a copy of Hegel&#x27;s Science of Logic. Marx referred to this volume while completing his drafts of &#x27;Capital&#x27;.

Bauer had already turned away from the socialism and communism of Marx and Engels, so he was immune to the barbs they wrote in &quot;The Holy Family or Critique of Critical Criticism. Against Bruno Bauer and Company&quot; by his pupils, Marx and Engels. Nevertheless, he had fallen quite far - from a favourite son of Hegel himself down to an enemy of both the right-wing and the left-wing as well. He found very few friends in this intellectual position aside from Max Stirner.

Condemned by both the right-wing and the left-wing, Bauer settled into his family&#x27;s tobacco shop to earn his living, though he continued to write. He never married, but he wrote many books, all the way to 1879. He died in 1883.

== Argument against the existence of Jesus ==
Bauer became the first author to systematically argue that Jesus did not exist.

Early in his academic career, however, Bauer was certain that Jesus certainly did exist - it was only that ordinary theologians continued to heap legend after legend onto the real, historical Jesus. In Albert Schweitzer&#x27;s &quot;The Quest of the Historical Jesus&quot; (1906), p. 143, Bauer is quoted as writing: &quot;We save the honor of Jesus when we restore His Person to life from the state of inanition to which the apologists have reduced it, and give it once more a living relation to history, which it certainly possessed - that can no longer be denied.&quot;

Beginning in 1841, in his &quot;Criticism of the Gospel History of the Synoptics&quot;, Bauer argued that the Biblical Jesus was primarily a literary figure. However, he left open the question of whether a historical Jesus existed at all until his 1851 work, &quot;Criticism of the Gospels and History of their Origin&quot; and then in 1879 proposed his theory for the true origin of Jesus in &quot;Christ and the Caesars&quot;, namely, that the Gospel writers freely used Greco-Roman classics in their mythical reconstructions of the life of the real man, Jesus of Galilee.

We should note, however, that in this opinion, Bauer remained close to the dialectical theology of GWF Hegel. Hegel hailed from the Rationalist School of Biblical critique, starting with Johann Gottfried Herder and Heinrich Paulus (who had been Hegel&#x27;s employer during his early days). There was in fact a large movement of Bible Rationalism in the early 1800s. Hegel and Bauer were both part of that movement. Hasty writers call that atheism. Actually, the literature of Hegel and Bauer affirms that Jesus was real - but that typical theologians had interpreted Jesus all wrong.

Bauer&#x27;s 1842 work, &quot;Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte der Synoptiker und des Johannes&quot; (3 vol) debated whether the gospels were purely literary, with no historically authentic material. While not yet rejecting the historicity of Jesus, Bauer denied the historicity of a supernatural Christ (viz. Jesus - a natural human).

Bauer wrote, &quot;Everything that the historical Christ is, everything that is said of Him, everything that is known of Him, belongs to the world of imagination, that is, of the imagination of the Christian community, and therefore has nothing to do with any man who belongs to the real world.&quot; (see David Strauss (1808-1874) who pioneered the search for the &quot;Historical Jesus&quot; by also rejecting the supernatural events of &quot;The Christ&quot;, in his 1835 work, &quot;Life of Jesus&quot;).

In his &quot;Criticism of the Pauline Epistles&quot; (1850-1852) and in &quot;A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin&quot; (1850-1851), Bauer argued that Jesus had not existed. Schweitzer notes, &quot;At the end of his study of the Gospels, Bauer is inclined to make the decision of the question whether there ever was a historic Jesus depend on the result of a further investigation which he proposed to make into the Pauline Epistles. It was not until ten years later (1850-1851) that he accomplished this task, (. (Criticism of the Pauline Epistles.) Berlin, 1850-1852.) and applied the result in his new edition of the &quot;Criticism of the Gospel History.&quot; ( [Criticism of the Gospels and History of their Origin] 2 vols., Berlin, 1850-1851) The result is negative: there never was any historical Jesus.&quot;

In &quot;Christ and the Caesars&quot; (1879) he suggested that Christianity was a synthesis of the Stoicism of Seneca the Younger and of the Jewish theology of Philo as developed by pro-Roman Jews such as Josephus. Bauer&#x27;s work was heavily criticized at the time; in 1842 he was removed from his position at the University of Bonn. Still, Bauer&#x27;s works were well-cited throughout Europe for the rest of the 19th century. In the 20th century, his work had little impact on future myth theorists.

Christ myth theory proponents still assert the threefold argument originally asserted by Bauer - &quot;allegedly&quot;:
* that the New Testament has no historical value.
* that there are no non-Christian references to Jesus Christ dating back to the first century.
* that Christianity had syncretistic or mythical roots.

This one-sided interpretation by author Van Voorst is quite common, but others, like Trejo, say that such an interpretation lacks the nuance that we find inside the pages of Bauer&#x27;s actual works. They say that Bauer didn&#x27;t deny the existence of Jesus of Galilee - but merely questioned the legends and Nature miracles told about him. Like GWF Hegel and the Rationalist School, Bauer would focus on the historical environment and the &quot;teachings&quot; of Jesus, rather than engage in sophomoric debates about the reality of Nature miracles.

== Legacy ==
Bauer&#x27;s scholarship was buried by German academia, and he remained a pariah, until Albert Kalthoff rescued his works from neglect and obscurity. Kalthoff revived Bauer&#x27;s Christ Myth thesis in his &quot;Das Christus-Problem. Grundlinien zu einer Sozialtheologie&quot; (&quot;The Problem of Christ: Principles of a Social Theology&quot;, 1902) and &quot;Die Entstehung des Christentums, Neue Beiträge zum Christusproblem&quot; (&quot;The Rise of Christianity&quot;, 1904).

Arthur Drews noted Bauer&#x27;s views in his own work &quot;The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present&quot;, &quot;Christianity is the product of the intimidated class of Romans who needed a straw of hope and faith in their struggle against the egoism of Caesars. It&#x27;s absurd to suppose it to be originating from Hierosolyma [Jerusalem]. The origin of the Gospel literature is then reexamined. Originally, it&#x27;s just a demonstration of the new principle of freedom, in rebellion against the law-dominated world, represented by Judaism. The Gospels demonstrate various steps in the evolution of this esteem. The main factor of influence was the Roman empire, whose oppression forced the community to look for hope in a kingdom of heavens and exterminate the kingdom of Rome to make it possible. ... Absolutely no such thing as a historical Jesus of Galilee is needed to explain the genesis of Mark&#x27;s gospel.&quot;

Despite these attempts at revival, Bauer&#x27;s positions are nowadays considered fringe. Already in 1906, Albert Schweitzer, while appreciating Bauer&#x27;s earlier work, was sharply critical towards his later support for the Christ myth theory, writing in his book &quot;The Quest of the Historical Jesus&quot; that Bauer &quot;originally sought to defend the honor of Jesus by rescuing his reputation from the inane parody of a biography that the Christian apologists had forged.&quot; However, he eventually came to the belief that it was a complete fiction and &quot;regarded the Gospel of Mark not only as the first narrator, but even as the creator of the gospel history, thus making the latter a fiction and Christianity the invention of a single original evangelist&quot; (Otto Pfleiderer).

In modern scholarship, the Christ myth theory is a fringe theory, which finds virtually no support from scholars, to the point of being addressed in footnotes or almost completely ignored due to the obvious weaknesses they espouse. Common criticisms against the Christ myth theory include: general lack of expertise or relationship to academic institutions and current scholarship; reliance on arguments from silence, dismissal of what sources actually state, and superficial comparisons with mythologies.

<doc id="73161" wikidata="Q478641" url="?curid=73161" title="Seigniorage">
<text>Seigniorage , also spelled seignorage or seigneurage (), is the difference between the value of money and the cost to produce and distribute it. The term can be applied in two ways:
* Seigniorage derived from specie (metal coins) is a tax added to the total cost of a coin (metal content and production costs) that a customer of the mint had to pay, and which was sent to the sovereign of the political region.
* Seigniorage derived from notes is more indirect; it is the difference between interest earned on securities acquired in exchange for banknotes and the cost of printing and distributing the notes.

&quot;Monetary seigniorage&quot; is where sovereign-issued securities are exchanged for newly printed banknotes by a central bank, allowing the sovereign to &quot;borrow&quot; without needing to repay. Monetary seigniorage is sovereign revenue obtained through routine debt monetization, including expansion of the money supply during GDP growth and meeting yearly inflation targets.

Seigniorage can be a convenient source of revenue for a government. By providing the government with increased purchasing power at the expense of public purchasing power, it imposes what is metaphorically known as an inflation tax on the public.

==Examples==
Seigniorage is the positive return, or carry, on issued notes and coins (money in circulation). Demurrage, the opposite, is the cost of holding currency.

An example of an exchange of gold for &quot;paper&quot; where no seigniorage occurs is when a person has one ounce of gold, trades it for a government-issued gold certificate (providing for redemption in one ounce of gold), keeps that certificate for a year, and redeems it in gold. That person began with and ends up with exactly one ounce of gold.

In another scenario, instead of issuing gold certificates a government converts gold into non-gold standard based currency at the market rate by printing paper notes. A person exchanges one ounce of gold for its value in that currency, keeps the currency for one year, and exchanges it for an amount of gold at the new market value. If the value of the currency relative to gold has changed in the interim, the second exchange will yield less (or more) than one ounce of gold (assuming that the value, or purchasing power, of one ounce of gold remains constant through the year). If the value of the currency relative to gold has decreased, the person receives less than one ounce of gold and seigniorage occurred. If the value of the currency relative to gold has increased, the person receives more than one ounce of gold and demurrage occurred; seigniorage did not occur.

==Ordinary seigniorage==
Ordinarily, seigniorage is an interest-free loan (of gold, for example) to the issuer of the coin or banknote. When the currency is worn out the issuer buys it back at face value, balancing the revenue received when it was put into circulation without any additional amount for the interest value of what the issuer received.

Historically, seigniorage was the profit resulting from producing coins. Silver and gold were mixed with base metals to make durable coins. The British pound sterling was 92.5 percent silver; the base metal added (and the pure silver retained by the government mint) was, less costs, the profit – the seigniorage. Before 1933, United States gold coins were 90 percent gold and 10 percent copper. To make up for the lack of gold, the coins were over-weighted. A one-ounce Gold American Eagle will have as much of the alloy as needed to contain a total of one ounce of gold (which will be over one ounce). Seigniorage is earned by selling the coins above the melt value in exchange for guaranteeing the weight of the coin.

Under the rules governing the monetary operations of major central banks (including the United States Federal Reserve), seigniorage on banknotes is the interest payments received by central banks on the total amount of currency issued. This usually takes the form of interest payments on treasury bonds purchased by central banks, putting more money into circulation. If the currency is collected, or is otherwise taken permanently out of circulation, the currency is never returned to the central bank; the issuer of the currency keeps the seigniorage profit by not having to buy back worn-out currency at face value.

===Solvency constraints of central banks===
The solvency constraint of a standard central bank requires that the present discounted value of its net non-monetary liabilities (separate from monetary liabilities accrued through seigniorage attempts) be zero or negative in the long run. Its monetary liabilities are liabilities in name only, since they are irredeemable. The holder of base money cannot insist on the redemption of a given amount into anything other than the same amount of itself, unless the holder of the base money is another central bank reclaiming the value of its original interest-free loan.

==Seigniorage as a tax==
Economists regard seigniorage as a form of inflation tax, returning resources to the currency issuer. Issuing new currency, rather than collecting taxes paid with existing money, is considered a tax on holders of existing currency. Inflation of the money supply causes a general rise in prices, due to the currency&#x27;s reduced purchasing power.

This is a reason offered in support of free banking, a gold or silver standard, or (at a minimum) the reduction of political control of central banks, which could then ensure currency stability by controlling monetary expansion (limiting inflation). Hard-money advocates argue that central banks have failed to attain a stable currency. Orthodox economists counter that deflation is difficult to control once it sets in, and its effects are more damaging than modest, consistent inflation.

Banks (or governments) relying heavily on seigniorage and fractional reserve sources of revenue may find them counterproductive. Rational expectations of inflation take into account a bank&#x27;s seigniorage strategy, and inflationary expectations can maintain high inflation. Instead of accruing seigniorage from fiat money and credit, most governments opt to raise revenue primarily through formal taxation and other means

==Contemporary use==
The 50 State Quarters series of quarters (25-cent coins) began in 1999. The U.S. government thought that many people, collecting each new quarter as it rolled out of the United States Mint, would remove the coins from circulation. Each complete set of quarters (the 50 states, the five inhabited U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia) is worth $14.00. Since it costs the mint about five cents to produce one quarter, the government made a profit when someone collected a coin. The Treasury Department estimates that it earned about $6.3 billion in seigniorage from the quarters during the program.

Some countries&#x27; national mints report the amount of seigniorage provided to their governments; the Royal Canadian Mint reported that in 2006 it generated $93 million in seigniorage for the government of Canada. The U.S. government, the largest beneficiary of seigniorage, earned about $25 billion in 2000. For coins only, the U.S. Treasury received 45 cents per dollar issued in seigniorage for the 2011 fiscal year.

Occasionally, central banks have issued limited quantities of higher-value banknotes in unusual denominations for collecting; the denomination will usually coincide with an anniversary of national significance. The potential seigniorage from such printings has been limited, since the unusual denomination makes the notes more difficult to circulate and only a relatively-small number of people collect higher-value notes.

Over half of Zimbabwe&#x27;s government revenue in 2008 was reportedly seigniorage. The country has experienced hyperinflation ever since, with an annualized rate of about 24,000 percent in July 2008 (prices doubling every 46 days).

==International circulation==
The international circulation of banknotes is a profitable form of seigniorage. Although the cost of printing banknotes is minimal, the foreign entity must provide goods and services at the note&#x27;s face value. The banknote is retained as a store of value, since the entity values it more than the local currency. Foreign circulation generally involves large-value banknotes, and can be used for private transactions (some of which are illegal).

American currency has been circulating globally for most of the 20th century, and the amount of currency in circulation increased several-fold during World War II. Large-scale printing of the United States one-hundred-dollar bill began when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991; production quadrupled, with the first trillion-dollar printing of the bill. At the end of 2008, U.S. currency in public circulation amounted to $824 billion and 76 percent of the currency supply was in the form of $100 bills (twenty $100 bills per U.S. citizen). The amount of U.S. currency circulating abroad is controversial. According to Porter and Judson, 53 to 67 percent was overseas during the mid-1990s. Feige estimates that about 40 percent is abroad. In a New York Federal Reserve publication, Goldberg writes that &quot;about 65 percent ($580 billion) of all banknotes are in circulation outside of the country&quot;. These figures are largely contradicted by Federal Reserve Board of Governors Flow of Funds statistics, which indicate that $313 billion (36.7 percent) of U.S. currency was held abroad at the end of March 2009. Feige calculates that since 1964, &quot;the cumulative seigniorage earnings accruing to the U.S. by virtue of the currency held by foreigners amounted to $167–$185 billion and over the past two decades seigniorage revenues from foreigners have averaged $6–$7 billion dollars per year&quot;.

The American $100 bill has competition from the €500 note, which facilitates the transport of larger amounts of money. One million dollars in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds (10 kg), and it is difficult to carry this much money without a briefcase and physical security. The same amount in €500 notes would weigh less than three pounds (1.4 kg), which could be dispersed in clothing and luggage without attracting attention or alerting security devices. In illegal operations, transporting currency is logistically more difficult than transporting cocaine because of its size and weight, and the ease of transporting its banknotes makes the euro attractive to Latin American drug cartels.

The Swiss 1,000-franc note, worth slightly more than $1,000, is probably the only other banknote in circulation outside its home country. However, it does not have a significant advantage over the €500 note to the non-Swiss; there are 20 times as many €500 notes in circulation, and they are more widely recognized. As a reserve currency, it makes up about 0.1% of the currency composition of official foreign-exchange reserves.

Governments vary in their issuance of large banknotes; in August 2009, the number of Fr. 1,000 notes in circulation was over three times the population of Switzerland. For comparison, the number of circulating £50 banknotes is slightly less than three times the population of the United Kingdom; the Fr. 1,000 franc note is worth about £600. The British government has been wary of large banknotes since the counterfeiting Operation Bernhard during World War II, which caused the Bank of England to withdraw all notes larger than £5 from circulation. The bank did not reintroduce other denominations until the early 1960s (£10), 1970 (£20) and March 20, 1981 (£50).

<doc id="73162" wikidata="Q181982" url="?curid=73162" title="Western Hemisphere">
<text>The Western Hemisphere is the half of the planet Earth that lies west of the Prime Meridian (which crosses Greenwich, London, United Kingdom) and east of the 180th meridian. The other half is called the Eastern Hemisphere. Geopolitically, the term Western Hemisphere is often used as a for the Americas or the &quot;New World&quot;, even though geographically the hemisphere also includes parts of other continents.

==Geography==
The Western Hemisphere consists of the Americas, excluding some of the Aleutian Islands to the southwest of the Alaskan mainland; the westernmost portions of Europe and Africa, both mainland and islands; the extreme eastern tip of the Russian mainland and islands (North Asia); numerous territories in Oceania; and a large portion of Antarctica.

The center of the Western Hemisphere is located in the Pacific Ocean at the intersection of the 90th meridian west and the Equator, among the Galápagos Islands. The nearest land is Genovesa Island at .

The highest mountain in the Western Hemisphere is Aconcagua in the Andes of Argentina at .

The tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere is the CN Tower in Toronto at and the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere is One World Trade Center in New York City at .

===Alternative definitions===
In an attempt to match the Western Hemisphere more closely with the Americas, some sources use the 20th meridian west and the diametrically opposed 160th meridian east to define the hemisphere. This definition excludes all of the European and African mainlands, but still includes some islands associated with these continents, more of eastern Russia and Oceania, and part of Antarctica. It includes all islands of Alaska, but excludes a small portion of northeast Greenland. There is no hemisphere that includes all of the Americas that also excludes all land outside of it, regardless of the meridians or points chosen to define it.

== Sovereign states in both hemispheres ==
Below is a list of the sovereign states in both the Western and Eastern hemispheres on the IERS Reference Meridian, in order from north to south:

* Denmark, due to the entirety of &quot;Greenland&quot; and the &quot;Faroe Islands&quot;. Denmark proper lies entirely within the Eastern Hemisphere.
* Norway, due only to Jan Mayen. Mainland Norway, &quot;Svalbard&quot; and &quot;Bouvet Island&quot; lie entirely within the Eastern Hemisphere.
* United Kingdom, passing through Greenwich, London. Most of the country lies within the Western Hemisphere.
* The Netherlands has overseas islands that lie entirely within the Western Hemisphere, while mainland Netherlands lies entirely within the Eastern Hemisphere.

* France, passing through Puynormand (Gironde). About 1/3 of the country, including cities like Nantes or Bordeaux, as well as the overseas regions of Guadeloupe, Martinique, and French Guiana lie within the Western Hemisphere.
* Spain, passing through Castellón de la Plana (Valencian Community). Most of Spain, including the capital Madrid, the Canary Islands and the southern half of its Mediterranean territorial waters, lies within the Western Hemisphere. Spanish, Moroccan and Algerian Mediterranean waters are the only part of the Mediterranean Sea located in the Western Hemisphere.
* Algeria, passing through Stidia. About 1/4 of the country, including Oran, Algeria&#x27;s second-largest city, lies within the Western Hemisphere.
* Mali, passing through the municipal area of Gao. Most of Mali, including the capital Bamako, lies within the Western Hemisphere.
* Burkina Faso, passing through Lalgaye. Most of the country, including the capital Ouagadougou, lies within the Western Hemisphere.
* Ghana, passing through Tema. Most of Ghana, including the capital Accra, lies within the Western Hemisphere.
* Togo, passing near Tami (Tône Prefecture in Savanes Region).

Below is a list of additional sovereign states which are in both the Western and Eastern hemispheres along the 180th meridian, in order from north to south. (France is not listed below due to its inclusion above, though the meridian does pass Wallis and Futuna.) With the exception of the United States (due to &quot;Wake Island&quot;, &quot;Guam&quot; and the &quot;Northern Mariana Islands&quot;), all of them are located on just one side of the International Date Line, which curves around them.

* Russia, passing through Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. Its portion lying east of the 180th meridian is the only part of the country lying in the Western Hemisphere.
* United States, passing through the Aleutian Islands (Alaska). Except for the portion of Aleutian Islands and waters lying west of the 180th meridian, &quot;Guam&quot;, the &quot;Northern Mariana Islands&quot;, and &quot;Wake Island&quot;, most of the country lies east of the 180th meridian.
* Kiribati, passing close to Arorae. The country has both the Equator and the 180th meridian (antimeridian) crossing through its territory. It is the only country located in four hemispheres.
* Tuvalu, passing close to its capital, Funafuti.
* Fiji, passing close to its dependency &quot;Rotuma&quot; and passing through Taveuni.
* Most of New Zealand proper lies within the Eastern Hemisphere; but Chatham Islands and Kermadec Islands, as well as the self-governing states of the &quot;Cook Islands&quot; and &quot;Niue&quot; and the dependent territory of &quot;Tokelau,&quot; lie east of the 180th meridian.

<text>The Chepang (), also known as Chewang, are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group from the rugged ridges of the Mahabharat mountain range of central Nepal.

With increasing populations, lack of arable land and few irrigation options, malnutrition has been a historic problem for the Chepang despite forest supplements. The Chepang have often been characterized as the poorest of Nepal&#x27;s poor. Forced teenage pregnancies are common. Chepang men and women are basically egalitarian and no social ranking exists as it does in caste Nepalese society. Many Chepang cannot read and write due to a lack of education beyond elementary school, and this illiteracy stands in contrast to the great gains Nepal has been making in reducing illiteracy. They are mostly located in Dhading District, Chitwan District, Gorkha District, Makwanpur District, and Tanahun District.

==Geographical distribution==
The 2011 Nepal census classifies the Chepang within the broader social group of Mountain/Hill Janajati. At the time of the 2011 Nepal census, 68,399 people (0.3% of the population of Nepal) were Chepang. The frequency of Chepang people by province was as follows:
* Bagmati Province (1.2%)
* Gandaki Province (0.2%)
* Koshi Province (0.0%)
* Lumbini Province (0.0%)
* Madhesh Province (0.0%)
* Karnali Province (0.0%)
* Sudurpashchim Province (0.0%)

The frequency of Chepang people was higher than national average (0.3%) in the following districts:
* Chitwan (5.0%)
* Makwanpur (4.6%)
* Dhading (4.3%)
* Gorkha (1.3%)

== Livelihood ==
Over the past two or three generations, the Chepang have begun to slowly shift from a semi-nomadic (slash-and-burn) lifestyle to a more settled way of life, relying increasingly upon the production of permanent fields of maize, millet and bananas. The severe topography, however, has made permanent farming difficult (and usually insufficient), and the forest has remained an important (although decreasingly so) source of food for the Chepang. Historically, the collection of wild yams and tubers, fish caught from nearby rivers, bats and wild birds, and periodically wild deer hunted from nearby forests, have supplemented their need for carbohydrates and protein.

==Religion==
According to the 2011 Nepal Census, there are almost 70,000 Chepang in the country, of which 65% were Hindu and 25% were Christian and 10% were animist. The Chepangs themselves follow Animism, although they are strongly influenced by both Hinduism and Buddhism, which came from the Tamangs just north of them. They observe all the Hindu festivals of Dashain, Tihar and Sakranti besides their own tribal festival &quot;Nwagi&quot; or &quot;Chhonam&quot;, which is performed on a Tuesday during third week of Bhadra (some day in August and September). Chhonam is the auspicious day for eating a new crop. Before the celebration of this festival, eating certain agricultural products is prohibited.

In the 5th National Gathering of Chepang, 2004, it was stated they practiced Prakriti (Nature), with ancestor worship as most important. They worship many deities including Bhumi, Aita Bare, Gaidu, Namrung (earth deity) etc. They also observe other different festivals like, Maghe Sakranti, Saune Sakranti, Dashain, Tihar.

In recent years, many of the Chepang have converted to Christianity.

==Language==
The language is also known as Chepang but is called by the people themselves. These people are also called &quot;Praja&quot; meaning &quot;political subjects&quot;. The people speak 3 different dialects of this Tibeto-Burman language that is closely related to Raute and Raji, two undocumented languages spoken in western Nepal. Chepang is one of the few languages which uses a duodecimal (base 12) counting system rather than the decimal (base 10).

==2015 earthquake and political crisis==
Chepang are among the most vulnerable due to the combination of April 2015 Nepal earthquake and 2015 Nepal blockade. More than 50 per cent of the people killed were from marginalised communities ranked low in the Human Development Index (HDI). Chepang communities were already suffering from severe malnutrition before the blockade, along with the Tamang. Due to historic discrimination and neglect and remote communities, Chepang have suffered discrimination even at the hands of the Nepali Food Corporation in charge of emergency food distribution. It is said that Chepangs compulsorily eat rice during Dashain, where meat is often eaten by more wealthy groups, but they are unlikely to afford even rice this year (2015). Hence they are among the most vulnerable ethnic groups facing potential population bottleneck in the winter of 2015/16 despite their already small numbers.

<doc id="73165" wikidata="Q998" url="?curid=73165" title="Infant">
<text>In common terminology, a baby is the very young offspring of human beings, while infant (from the Latin word &quot;infans&quot;, meaning &#x27;baby&#x27; or &#x27;child&#x27;) is a formal or specialised synonym. The terms may also be used to refer to juveniles of other organisms. A newborn is, in colloquial use, a baby who is only hours, days, or weeks old; while in medical contexts, a newborn or neonate (from Latin, &quot;neonatus&quot;, newborn) is an infant in the first 28 days after birth (the term applies to premature, full term, and postmature infants).

Infants born prior to 37 weeks of gestation are called &quot;premature&quot;, those born between 39 and 40 weeks are &quot;full term&quot;, those born through 41 weeks are &quot;late term&quot;, and anything beyond 42 weeks is considered &quot;post term&quot;.

Before birth, the offspring is called a fetus. The term &quot;infant&quot; is typically applied to very young children under one year of age; however, definitions may vary and may include children up to two years of age. When a human child learns to walk, they are called a toddler instead.

== Other uses ==
In British English, an &quot;infant school&quot; is for children aged between four and seven.

As a legal term, &quot;infancy&quot; is more like minority, and continues until a person reaches 18 years of age.

==Physical characteristics==

A newborn&#x27;s shoulders and hips are wide, the abdomen protrudes slightly, and the arms and legs are relatively long with respect to the rest of their body.

===Head===
A newborn&#x27;s head is very large in proportion to the body, and the cranium is enormous relative to his or her face. While the adult human skull is about one seventh of the total body length, the newborn&#x27;s is about . Normal head circumference for a full-term infant is 33–36 cm at birth. At birth, many regions of the newborn&#x27;s skull have not yet been converted to bone, leaving &quot;soft spots&quot; known as fontanels. The two largest are the diamond-shaped anterior fontanel, located at the top front portion of the head, and the smaller triangular-shaped posterior fontanel, which lies at the back of the head. Later in the child&#x27;s life, these bones will fuse together in a natural process. A protein called noggin is responsible for the delay in an infant&#x27;s skull fusion.

During labour and birth, the infant&#x27;s skull changes shape to fit through the birth canal, sometimes causing the child to be born with a misshapen or elongated head. It will usually return to normal on its own within a few days or weeks. Special exercises sometimes advised by physicians may assist the process.

===Hair===

Some newborns have a fine, downy body hair called lanugo. It may be particularly noticeable on the back, shoulders, forehead, ears and face of premature infants. Lanugo disappears within a few weeks. Infants may be born with full heads of hair; others, particularly Caucasian infants, may have very fine hair or may even be bald. Amongst fair-skinned parents, this fine hair may be blonde, even if the parents are not. An infant&#x27;s hair color and texture can change: red can give way to blond, curly can go straight, and thick, dark hair could reappear a lot sparser and lighter. The scalp may also be temporarily bruised or swollen, especially in hairless newborns, and the area around the eyes may be puffy.

===Length===
In developed countries, the average total body length of a newborn is , although premature newborns may be much smaller.

The way to measure a baby&#x27;s length is to lay the baby down and stretch a measuring tape from the top of the head to the bottom of the heel.

===Weight===
In developed countries, the average birth weight of a full-term newborn is approximately , and is typically in the range of .

Over the first 5–7 days following birth, the body weight of a term neonate decreases by 3–7%, and is largely a result of the resorption and urination of the fluid that initially fills the lungs, in addition to a delay of often a few days before breastfeeding becomes effective. After the first week, healthy term neonates should gain 10–20 grams/kg/day.

===Skin===

Immediately after birth, a newborn&#x27;s skin is often grayish to dusky blue in color. As soon as the newborn begins to breathe, usually within a minute or two, the skin&#x27;s color reaches its normal tone. Newborns are wet, covered in streaks of blood, and coated with a white substance known as vernix caseosa, which is hypothesised to act as an antibacterial barrier. The newborn may also have Mongolian spots, various other birthmarks, or peeling skin, particularly on the wrists, hands, ankles, and feet.

===Umbilical cord===

The umbilical cord of a newborn is bluish-white in color. After birth, the umbilical cord is normally cut, leaving a 1–2 inch stub. The umbilical stub will dry out, shrivel, darken, and spontaneously fall off within about 3 weeks. This will later become a belly-button after it heals.

The umbilical cord contains three vessels: two arteries and one vein. The two arteries carry blood from the baby to the placenta while one vein carries blood back to the baby.

===Genitals===
A newborn&#x27;s genitals are enlarged and reddened, with male infants having an unusually large scrotum. The breasts may also be enlarged, even in male infants. This is caused by naturally occurring maternal hormones and is a temporary condition. Females (and even males) may actually discharge milk from their nipples (sometimes called witch&#x27;s milk), or a bloody or milky-like substance from the vagina. In either case, this is considered normal and will disappear with time.

==Care and feeding==

Infants cry as a form of basic instinctive communication. A crying infant may be trying to express a variety of feelings including hunger, discomfort, overstimulation, boredom, wanting something, or loneliness.

Infants are altricial and are fully dependent on their mothers or an adult caretaker for an extended period of time. Breastfeeding is the recommended method of feeding by all major infant health organizations. If breastfeeding is not possible or desired, bottle feeding is done with expressed breast-milk or with infant formula. Infants are born with a sucking reflex allowing them to extract the milk from the nipples of the breasts or the nipple of the baby bottle, as well as an instinctive behavior known as &quot;rooting&quot; with which they seek out the nipple. Sometimes a wet nurse is hired to feed the infant, although this is rare, especially in developed countries.

Adequate food consumption at an early age is vital for an infant&#x27;s development. The foundations of optimum health, growth, and neurodevelopment across the lifespan are established in the first 1,000 days of life. From birth to six months, infants should consume only breast milk or an unmodified milk substitute. As an infant&#x27;s diet matures, finger foods may be introduced as well as fruit, vegetables and small amounts of meat.

As infants grow, food supplements can be added. Many parents choose commercial, ready-made baby foods to supplement breast milk or formula for the child, while others adapt their usual meals for the dietary needs of their child. Whole cow&#x27;s milk can be used at one year, but lower-fat milk is not recommended until the child is two to three years old. Weaning is the process through which breast milk is eliminated from the infant&#x27;s diet through the introduction of solid foods in exchange for milk. Until they are toilet-trained, infants in industrialized countries wear diapers. The transition from diapers to training pants is an important transition in the development of an infant to that of a toddler. Children need more sleep than adults—up to 18 hours for newborn babies, with a declining rate as the child ages. Until babies learn to walk, they are carried in the arms, held in slings or baby carriers, or transported in baby carriages or strollers. Most industrialized countries have laws requiring child safety seats for babies in motor vehicles.

===Common care issues===

* Baby colic
* Bassinet/crib
* Cradle cap
* Day care
* Diaper rash
* Infant massage
* Immunization
* Pacifier
* Paternal bond
* Swaddling
* Teething
===Benefits of touch===

Experiments have been done with infants up to four months of age using both positive touch (stroking or cuddling) and negative touch (poking, pinching, or tickling). The infants who received the positive touch cried less often and vocalized and smiled more than the infants who were touched negatively. Infants who were the recipients of negative touch have also been linked with emotional and behavioral problems later in life. A lower amount of physical violence in adults has been discovered in cultures with greater levels of positive physical touching.

=== Language development ===

Caregivers of an infant are advised to pick up on the infant&#x27;s facial expressions and mirror them. Reproducing and empathizing with their facial expressions enables infants to experience effectiveness and to recognize their own actions more easily (see mirror neurons). Exaggeratedly reproduced facial expressions and gestures are recommended, as they are clearer forms of expression. The baby&#x27;s babbling should also be picked up and repeated. By imitating each other&#x27;s sounds the first simple dialogues are initiated. Accentuated pronunciation and melodic intonation make it easier to recognize individual words in a sentence. However, it is not advisable to use simplified &quot;baby talk&quot; (e.g. &quot;Did you &#x27;ouch&#x27;?&quot; instead of, &quot;Did you hurt yourself?&quot;).

Even if parents cannot yet understand infants&#x27; babbling, a timely response by parents to babbling leads to faster language acquisition. This was confirmed by researchers who first studied mothers&#x27; behavior towards 8-month-old infants and later tested the infants&#x27; vocabulary when they were 15 months old. A first important development of infants is the discovery that they can influence their parents through babbling (development of intentional communication). Parents can encourage this by engaging with their infants in babbling. This in turn promotes further language development, as infants then turn to their parents more often.

Previous studies have shown that the infant&#x27;s speech is encouraged when parents, for example, smile in the infant&#x27;s direction or touch the infant every time the infant looks at them and babbles. It also helps if parents respond to what they think their baby is saying (for example, giving a ball or commenting when the baby looks at the ball and babbles). Responding to sounds produced when the baby looks at an object (object-directed vocalizations) thus provide an opportunity to learn the name of the object. In this way, babies also learn that sounds are associated with objects. However, language development is only achieved if parents react positively (e.g. smile) in response to the infant&#x27;s babbling. A high response rate without a connection to the infant&#x27;s utterances does not lead to language promotion. It is detrimental to language development if a mother instead tries to divert the infant&#x27;s attention to something else.

=== Sleep ===
A 2018 review analysed 146 studies on infant sleep behavior and listed several factors that show an effect on sleep duration and the number of night awakenings. However, research has indicated that frequent wakings are protective of SIDS.

Infant sleep is not linear, ebbing and flowing with developmental milestones and age.

The National Sleep Foundation gives a rough recommendation on sleep hours, that commonly decreases with increasing age.

=== Maternal sensitivity ===
Maternal sensitivity plays a particular role in the relationship with the infant and for favorable emotional development. This means being attentive to the infant&#x27;s behavioral expressions, not misinterpreting the infant&#x27;s expressions because of one&#x27;s own moods, reacting immediately to the situation and finding a response that is appropriate to the context and the expressed needs. A secure attachment is promoted through empathetic and adequate as well as prompt responses. In accordance with their basic needs, infants show an inborn behavior of seeking closeness to the mother – or to another primary caregiver – and thus in turn foster an attachment. When separated from the mother, infants protest by crying and by body movements.

=== Other ===

Wearing has a calming effect on infants. A 2013 study showed that infants placed in a cradle cried and kicked more often and had an increased heart rate (so the infants were stressed), while those picked up and carried by the mother while walking around calmed down significantly. The effect of being held motionless in the arm was intermediate between that of being carried around and that of being put down. That carrying (e.g., in a baby sling) makes infants more content and makes them cry less had already been shown in a randomized study in 1986.

For infant feeding, breastfeeding is recommended by all major infant health organizations.

Many airlines refuse boarding for all babies aged under 7 days (for domestic flights) or 14 days for international flights. Asiana Airlines allows babies to board international flights at 7 days of age. Garuda Indonesia disallows all babies under the age of 14 days to board any flights.

Delta Air Lines allows infants to travel when they are less than 7 days old when they present a physician travel approval letter. Skywest will not allow an infant less than 8 days old on board.

== Behaviour ==
===Emotional development===

Attachment theory is primarily an evolutionary and ethological theory whereby the infant or child &quot;seeks proximity&quot; to a &quot;specified attachment figure&quot; in situations of alarm or distress for the purpose of survival. The forming of attachments is considered to be the foundation of the infant/child&#x27;s capacity to form and conduct relationships throughout life. Attachment is not the same as love or affection although they often go together. Attachment and attachment behaviors tend to develop between the age of six months and 3 years. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment, which in turn lead to &#x27;internal working models&#x27; which will guide the individual&#x27;s feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. There are a number of attachment &#x27;styles&#x27; namely &#x27;secure&#x27;, &#x27;anxious-ambivalent&#x27;, &#x27;anxious-avoidant&#x27;, (all &#x27;organized&#x27;) and &#x27;disorganized&#x27;, some of which are more problematic than others. A lack of attachment or a seriously disrupted capacity for attachment could potentially amount to serious disorders.

Infants develop distinct relationships to their mothers, fathers, siblings, and non-familial caregivers. Beside the dyadic attachment relationships also a good quality of the triadic relationships (mother – father – infant) is important for infant mental health development.

===Response to sounds===
Infants respond to the sound of snake hissing, angry voices of adults, the crackling sound of a fire, thunder, and the cries of other infants. They have a drop in heart rate, their eyes blinking, increased turning toward the speakers or parent, all of these indicating that they were paying more attention. This is believed to be an evolutionary response to danger. Babies&#x27; ability to accurately locate sounds is refined during their first year.

== Health issues ==

=== Diseases ===

The infant is undergoing many adaptations to extrauterine life, and its physiological systems, such as the immune system, are far from fully developed. Potential diseases of concern during the neonatal period include:
* Neonatal jaundice
* Infant respiratory distress syndrome
* Neonatal lupus erythematosus
* Neonatal conjunctivitis
* Neonatal tetanus
* Neonatal sepsis
* Neonatal bowel obstruction
* Benign neonatal seizures
* Neonatal diabetes mellitus
* Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia
* Neonatal herpes simplex
* Neonatal hemochromatosis
* Neonatal meningitis
* Neonatal hepatitis
* Neonatal hypoglycemia

===Mortality===
Infant mortality is the death of an infant in the first year of life, often expressed as the number of deaths per 1,000 live births (infant mortality rate). Major causes of infant mortality include dehydration, infection, congenital malformation and SIDS.

This epidemiological indicator is recognized as a very important measure of the level of health care in a country because it is directly linked with the health status of infants, children, and pregnant women as well as access to medical care, socioeconomic conditions, and public health practices.

There is a positive relationship between national wealth and good health. The rich and industrialized countries of the world, prominently Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, spend a large proportion of their wealthy budget on the health care system. As, a result, their health care systems are very sophisticated, with many physicians, nurses, and other health care experts servicing the population. Thus, infant mortality is low. On the other hand, a country such as Mexico, which spends disproportionately less of its budget on healthcare, suffers from high mortality rates. This is because the general population is likely to be less healthy. In the U.S., infant mortality rates are especially high in minority groups. For instance, non-Hispanic black women have an infant mortality rate of 13.63 per 1,000 live births whereas in non-Hispanic white women it was much lower at a rate of 5.76 per 1,000 live births. The average infant mortality rate in the U.S. is 6.8 per 1,000 live births.

==Babyhood==
Babyhood is a critical period in personality development when the foundations of adult personality are laid. In contrast toddler is used to denote a baby that has achieved relative independence, in moving about, and feeding.

<doc id="73166" wikidata="Q86155" url="?curid=73166" title="Karl Salomo Zachariae von Lingenthal">
<text>Karl Salomo Zachariae von Lingenthal, (14 September 1769 – 27 March 1843), a German jurist, was born at Meissen in Saxony, the son of a lawyer, and was the father of Karl Eduard Zachariae.

Von Lingenthal received his early education at the famous public school of St. Afra in Meissen and later studied philosophy, history, mathematics and jurisprudence at the University of Leipzig. In 1792 he went to Wittenberg University as tutor to one of the counts of Lippe, and continued his legal studies.

In 1794 he became &quot;Privatdozent&quot;, lecturing on Canon law, in 1798 extraordinary professor, and 1802 ordinary professor of feudal law.

From that time to his death in 1843, with the exception of a short period in which public affairs occupied him, he poured out a succession of works covering the whole field of jurisprudence, and was a copious contributor to periodicals. In 1807 he received a call to Heidelberg, then beginning its period of splendour as a school of law. There, resisting many calls to Göttingen, Berlin and other universities, he remained until his death. In 1820 he took his seat, as representative of his university, in the upper house of the newly constituted parliament of Baden.

Though he himself prepared many reforms - notably in the harsh criminal code - he was, by instinct and conviction, conservative and totally opposed to the violent democratic spirit which dominated the second chamber, and brought it into conflict with the grand-duke and the German federal government.

After the remodelling of the constitution in a &quot;reactionary&quot; sense, he was returned, in 1825, by the district of Heidelberg to the second chamber, of which he became the first vice-president, and in which he proved himself more &quot;loyal&quot; than the government itself. With the growth of parliamentary Liberalism, however, he grew disgusted with politics, from which he retired altogether in 1829. He then devoted himself wholly to juridical work and to the last days of his life toiled with the ardour of a young student.

== Works and studies ==
The German universities then enjoyed, in regard to legal questions of international importance, a moral jurisdiction dating from the Middle Ages, and Zachariae was often consulted as to questions arising in Germany, France and England.

Elaborate &quot;opinions,&quot; some of them forming veritable treatises - e.g. on Sir Augustus d&#x27;Este&#x27;s claim to the dukedom of Sussex, Baron de Bode&#x27;s claim as an English subject to a share in the French indemnity, the dispute as to the debts due to the elector of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), confiscated by Napoleon, and the constitutional position of the Mecklenburg landowners - were composed by Zachariae.

Large fees which he received for these opinions and the great popularity of his lectures made him rich, and he was able to buy several estates; from one of which, Lingenthal, he took his title when, in 1842, he was ennobled by the grand-duke. He died on 27 March 1843. He had married in 1811, but his wife died four years later, leaving him a son, Karl Eduard.

Zachariae&#x27;s writings are many and multifarious. They deal with almost every branch of jurisprudence; they are philosophical, historical and practical, and relate to Roman, Canon, German, French and English law. The first book of much consequence which he published was &quot;Die Einheit des Staats und der Kirche mit Rücksicht auf die Deutsche Reichsverfassung&quot; (1797), a work on the relations of church and state, with special reference to the constitution of the empire, which displayed the writer&#x27;s power of analysis and his skill in making a complicated set of facts appear to be deductions from a few principles.

In 1805 appeared &quot;Versuch einer allgemeinen Hermeneutik des Rechts&quot;; and in 1806 &quot;Die Wissenschaft der Gesetzgebung&quot;, an attempt to find a new theoretical basis for society in place of the opportunist politics which had led to the cataclysm of the French Revolution. This basis he seemed to discover in something resembling Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s utilitarianism.

Zachariae&#x27;s last work of importance was &quot;Vierzig Bücher vom Staate&quot; (1839–1842), to which his admirers point as his enduring monument. It has been compared to Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Esprit des lois,&quot; &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; and covers no small part of the field of Buckle&#x27;s first volume of the History of Civilization. But though it contains proof of vast erudition and many original ideas as to the future of the state and of law, it lacks logical sequence, and is, consequently, full of contradictions.

Its fundamental theory is that the state had its origin, not in a contract (Rousseau-Kant), but in the consciousness of a legal duty. What Machiavelli was to the Italians and Montesquieu to the French, Zachariae aspired to become to the Germans; but he lacked their patriotic inspiration, and so failed to exercise any permanent influence on the constitutional law of his country.

Among other important works of Zachariae are his &quot;Staatsrecht&quot;, and his treatise on the Code Napoléon, &quot;Handbuch des Französischen Civilrechts&quot; (1st print Heidelberg; 1808), of which several French editions were published, and which was translated into Italian. He strongly referred in his work to the importance of Roman Codification.

Zachariae edited with Karl Joseph Mittermaier the &quot;Kritische Zeitschrift für Rechtswissenschaft und Gesetzgebung des Auslandes&quot;, and the introduction which he wrote illustrates his wide reading and his constant desire for new light upon old problems. Though Zachariae&#x27;s works have been superseded, they were in their day epoch-making, and they have been superseded by books which, without them, could not have been written.

For an account of Zachariae and his works, see Robert von Mohl, &quot;Geschichte u. Literatur der Staatswissenschaften&quot; (1855–58), and Charles Brocher, &quot;K. S. Zachariae, sa vie et ses oeuvres&quot; (1870); cf. also his biography in &quot;Allgem. Deutsche Biographie&quot; (vol. 44) by Wilhelm Fischer, and &quot;Zachariae von Lingenthal&quot; in Franz von Holtzendorff&#x27;s &quot;Rechts-Lexicon&quot;.

<text>Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (February 16, 1802 – January 16, 1866) was an American folk healer, mentalist and mesmerist. His work is widely recognized as foundational to the New Thought spiritual movement.

==Early life==
Born in the small town of Lebanon, New Hampshire, Quimby was one of seven children and the son of a blacksmith and his wife. As was customary for his social and economic class at that time, Quimby received little formal education. He later wrote that he suffered from consumption (now called tuberculosis) in his youth, a disease that then had no cure, and was prescribed calomel by his doctor. The calomel was no cure, and began to rot his teeth.

Quimby began experimenting with his own ideas for a cure. He found that intense excitement (such as galloping on his horse) alleviated his pain for brief periods of time, and he became interested in the mind&#x27;s ability to affect the body. He claimed to have cured himself of consumption by his methods.

==Mesmerism==
About 1836 Charles Poyen came to Maine from France on an extended lecture tour in New England about mesmerism, also widely known as hypnotism. He was a French mesmerist who followed in the tradition of Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis of Puységur. The &quot;McClure’s&quot; magazine 1907 biographical serial of Mary Baker Eddy written by Willa Cather &amp; Georgine Milmine started the misunderstanding that Quimby was a follower of Poyen and followed him around—which is not supported by the Quimby family or Quimby&#x27;s writings. In fact, Quimby wrote about seven years later about hearing Poyen lecture: &quot;Mesmerism was introduced into the U[nited] State[s] by M. Charles Poyen, a French gentleman, who did not appear to be highly blest with the powers of magnetising to the satisfaction of his audience in his public lectures. I had the pleasure of listening to one of his lectures, &amp; pronounced it a humbug as a matter of course. And that his remarkable experiments, which were related, were, in my belief, equally true with witch craft—I had never been a convert to witch craft, nor had even had any personal interviews[?] with ghosts or hobgoblins &amp; therefore considered all stories bordering on the marvelous as delusive—&quot;. Instead it appears that it was Robert Hanham Collyer, another practitioner of animal magnetism, who visited Belfast in 1841, who attracted Quimby&#x27;s interest:

&quot;Next came Dr Collyer, who perhaps did more to excite a spirit of enquirey throughout the community than any who have succeeded.&quot;

(Quimby&#x27;s son George stated in &quot;New England Magazine,&quot; March, 1888, that &quot;a gentleman visited Belfast, about the year 1838,&quot; but an extensive search of Belfast newspapers during that time period finds no visit by Poyen mentioned in 1838, even though Poyen was quite newsworthy. 1838 is too early for Robert Collyer. 1836 appears to be the correct year for Poyen.)

About 1842 Quimby encountered Lucius Burkmar, a local youth who was particularly susceptible to hypnosis. Finding him useful to work with, Quimby and Burkmar developed a tour of their own. Quimby demonstrated mesmeric practice with Burkmar in front of large crowds.

Later Quimby and Burkmar stopped touring. Quimby claimed to heal people of ailments which doctors could not cure. Quimby told his patients that disease was caused by false beliefs, and that the cure was in the explanation of this. Quimby published a flyer, &quot;TO THE SICK,&quot; that was used about late 1850s to early 1860s and read as follows. It is an important statement of his beliefs:

DR. P. P. QUIMBY would respectfully announce to the citizens of [blank space to be filled in] and vicinity, that he will be at the [blank space to be filled in] where he will attend to those wishing to consult him in regard to their health, and, as his practise is unlike all other medical practise, it is necessary to say that he gives no medicines and makes no outward applications, but simply sits down by the patients, tells them their feelings and what they think is their disease. If the patients admit that he tells them their feelings, &amp;c., then his explanation is the cure; and, if he succeeds in correcting their error, he changes the fluids of the system and establishes the truth, or health. The Truth is the Cure. This mode of practise applies to all cases. If no explanation is given, no charge is made, for no effect is produced. His opinion without an explanation is useless, for it contains no knowledge, and would be like other medical opinions, worse than none. This error gives rise to all kinds of quackery, not only among regular physicians, but those whose aim is to deceive people by pretending to cure all diseases. The sick are anxious to get well, and they apply to these persons supposing them to be honest and friendly, whereas they are made to believe they are very sick and something must be done ere it is too late. Five or ten dollars is then paid, for the cure of some disease they never had, nor ever would have had but for the wrong impressions received from these quacks, or robbers, (as they might be called,) for it is the worst kind of robbery, tho&#x27; sanctioned by law. Now, if they will only look at the true secret of this description, they will find it is for their own selfish objects—to sell their medicines. Herein consists their shrewdness!—to impress patients with a wrong idea, namely—that they have some disease. This makes them nervous and creates in their minds a disease that otherwise would never have been thought of. Wherefore he says to such, never consult a quack: you not only lose your money, but your health.&lt;br&gt;

He gives no opinion, therefore you lose nothing. If patients feel pain they know it, and if he describes their pain he feels it, and in his explanation lies the cure. Patients, of course, have some opinion as to what causes pain—he has none, therefore the disagreement lies not in the pain, but in the cause of the pain. He has the advantage of patients, for it is very easy to convince them that he had no pain before he sat down by them. After this it becomes his duty to prove to them the cause of their trouble. This can only be explained to patients, for which explanation his charge is [blank space to be filled in] dollars. If necessary to see them more than once, [blank space to be filled in] dollars. This has been his mode of practice for the last seventeen years. For the past eight years he has given no medicines, nor made any outward applications.&lt;br&gt;

There are many who pretend to practice as he does, but when a person while in &quot;a trance,&quot; claims any power from the spirits of the departed, and recommends any kind of medicine to be taken internally or applied externally beware! believe them not, &quot;for by their fruits ye shall know them.

==Personal life==
Quimby married in 1827 and had a family of four children. One of his sons, George, was a follower and strong defender of him, working to differentiate his work from that of Mary Baker Eddy, a patient who later founded Christian Science. His son owned his father&#x27;s writings, which were mostly not released until the 1920s, after the son&#x27;s death.

==Inventor==
By trade Quimby was a watch and clockmaker. He also was a daguerreotypist, and he invented items and held several patents for a variety of unrelated, larger mechanical devices.
:(d) Phineas P. Quimby is listed as patentee for &quot;US Patent: 8,232X: Sawing timber: Chain saw for sawing timber, wood, metal, marble, etc.&quot;, 3 June 1834. As of 21 September 2007, no records have been found for any of the patent numbers ranging from X5475 to X5497 inclusive — i.e., from 30 April 1829 to 11 June 1829).

==Followers and patients==
===Notable followers===

Among the people who claimed to be cured by Quimby were Julius Dresser and his wife Annetta Dresser, from what sickness it is unclear. Their son, Horatio Dresser, wrote extensively on Quimby&#x27;s theories. He edited and collected many of Quimby&#x27;s papers in his book &quot;Health and the Inner Life: An Analytical and Historical Study of Spiritual Healing and Theories&quot; (1906). He also edited and published selected Quimby papers in the book, &quot;The Quimby Manuscripts&quot; (1921).

Warren Felt Evans was a Methodist minister who was moving over to Swedenborgianism about the time that he visited Quimby twice about 1863. While he was reputed to be a student of Quimby, modern scholarship has shown that he considered himself an equal of Quimby and not a student.

===Notable patients===
Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, was a patient of Quimby&#x27;s and a healer steeped in Protestant theology and science. Later, claims were made that she was at least partially inspired by Quimby in her theology. However, both Quimby&#x27;s son and Christian Scientists have pointed out major differences between Quimbyism and Christian Science. Biographer Gillian Gill and others agreed, pointing out that because of its theism, Christian Science differs considerably from the teachings of Quimby, who did not base his work in religion.

==Beliefs==
Quimby has sometimes been connected with Transcendentalism, especially by historians relying on the Dresser version of his writings, however his knowledge of Emerson and the Transcendentalists &quot;was no doubt tenuous and secondhand at best&quot; according to Albanese, and it was really only &quot;Dresser&#x27;s spiritualized Quimby that fit this classification&quot; according to Hazen. 

==Legacy==
Quimby is sometimes identified as the &quot;founder of New Thought,&quot; but his actual influence is debated. Since Quimby&#x27;s writings were not available until Dresser&#x27;s &quot;The Quimby Manuscripts&quot; in 1921, they did not directly effect New Thought&#x27;s development during its formative period. Barry Morton, a scholar of faith healing, has said that Quimby&#x27;s constant practice of his mind cure method led him to make important discoveries related to curing psychosomatic illnesses, and in effect started a &quot;gnostic&quot; healing tradition. Some of his methods were adopted by John Alexander Dowie, who revolutionized Christian faith healing in the 1880s.

<doc id="73170" wikidata="Q215518" url="?curid=73170" title="Aladdin (1992 Disney film)">
<text>Aladdin is a 1992 American animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution under Walt Disney Pictures. The film was produced and directed by John Musker and Ron Clements. Based on the Arabic folktale &quot;Aladdin&quot; from &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, the screenplay was co-written by Musker and Clements alongside Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. The voice cast includes Scott Weinger, Robin Williams, Linda Larkin, Jonathan Freeman, Frank Welker, Gilbert Gottfried, and Douglas Seale, with Lea Salonga performing Jasmine&#x27;s singing voice. The story follows the titular character, Aladdin, an Arabian street urchin who discovers a magic lamp containing a genie, with whose help he disguises himself as a wealthy prince and tries to impress the Sultan of Agrabah to win the heart of his free-spirited daughter, Princess Jasmine, as the Sultan&#x27;s evil vizier, Jafar, plots to steal the magic lamp.

Lyricist Howard Ashman pitched the idea to Disney Studios president, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and the screenplay went through three drafts before Katzenberg would agree to its production. The animators based their designs on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, and computers were used for both finishing the artwork and creating some animated elements. Composed by Alan Menken, the musical score features six songs with lyrics written by both Ashman and Tim Rice (who took over following Ashman&#x27;s death).

&quot;Aladdin&quot; was released on November 11, 1992. It received positive reviews from critics—particularly for Williams&#x27;s performance as the genie—and was a commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1992, with an earning of over $504 million in worldwide box-office revenue. On release, it became the first animated feature to reach the half-billion-dollar mark, and it was the fifth highest-grossing film at the time of its release and highest-grossing animated film of all time until surpassed by &quot;The Lion King&quot;.

&quot;Aladdin&quot; garnered two Academy Awards, as well as other accolades for its soundtrack, which had the first number from a Disney feature to earn a Grammy Award for Song of the Year, for the film&#x27;s &quot;A Whole New World&quot;, sung by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle. The film&#x27;s home VHS release set a sales record, grossing approximately $500million in the United States. success led to various derived works and other material inspired by the film, including two direct-to-video sequels, &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; and &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot;, an animated television series, and a Broadway adaptation. A live-action film adaptation directed by Guy Ritchie was released on May 24, 2019.

== Plot ==

Jafar, a sorcerer and the royal vizier of the Middle Eastern city of Agrabah, seeks a magic lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders that only &quot;the diamond in the rough&quot; can retrieve. Meanwhile, Princess Jasmine is unsatisfied with her sheltered life in the palace, so she escapes and encounters a young street urchin named Aladdin, and his pet monkey, Abu. As a bond between Aladdin and Jasmine develops, Jafar has the palace guards capture and imprison Aladdin, who learns Jasmine&#x27;s identity. Jasmine demands that Jafar release Aladdin, but he lies and claims that Aladdin has already been beheaded.

Disguised as an elderly beggar, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu and orders them to retrieve the lamp from the cave. The cave&#x27;s guardian grants Aladdin entry, but warns him to touch only the lamp. Aladdin finds both the lamp and a flying magic carpet inside, but Abu grabs a large jewel and triggers a cave-in. They flee to the entrance and give the lamp to Jafar, who throws the pair into the cave. While trapped underground, Abu reveals to Aladdin that he stole the lamp back. Aladdin rubs the lamp, from which the Genie emerges. The Genie grants Aladdin three wishes, although Aladdin tricks him into freeing them from the cave without using a wish. Upon learning the Genie&#x27;s desire to be released from servitude, Aladdin promises to use his last wish to free him. To woo Jasmine, Aladdin uses his first wish to become a prince.

At the suggestion of his parrot sidekick, Iago, Jafar plans to marry Jasmine and then kill both her and her father, the Sultan. Meanwhile, Aladdin arrives in Agrabah as Prince Ali, but Jasmine is uninterested in his grandstanding. Later, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a romantic ride on the carpet. After she deduces that Aladdin is the boy she had met earlier, he lies that he sometimes dresses as a commoner to escape palace life. After Aladdin brings Jasmine home, Jafar has the guards capture him and throw him into the sea, where the Genie uses Aladdin&#x27;s second wish to rescue him. Returning to the palace, Aladdin reveals Jafar&#x27;s plot to Jasmine and the Sultan, but Jafar realizes Aladdin&#x27;s identity and escapes from the guards.

With everything seemingly resolved, the Genie requests his freedom; however, Aladdin declines, worried that he needs the Genie&#x27;s facade to stay with Jasmine. The Genie, offended, retreats into his lamp, which is later stolen by Iago and brought to Jafar. Now the Genie&#x27;s master, Jafar uses his first two wishes to become sultan, then a powerful sorcerer, and sends Aladdin to a frozen wasteland. Using the magic carpet, Aladdin escapes and returns to Agrabah, where he fights Jafar for the lamp. Aladdin taunts Jafar for being less powerful than the Genie, tricking him into using his last wish to become a genie himself. This causes Jafar to become trapped in his new lamp, taking Iago with him. The Genie throws Jafar&#x27;s lamp into the Cave of Wonders.

The Genie encourages Aladdin to use his third wish to regain his royal title and legally marry Jasmine. Aladdin instead decides to keep his promise, wishing the Genie free. The Sultan allows Jasmine to marry whomever she chooses, and she gladly chooses Aladdin. The Genie bids the group a fond farewell and leaves to explore the world, while Aladdin and Jasmine start their new life together.

== Voice cast ==

*Scott Weinger as Aladdin, a poor yet kind-hearted Agrabah thief. For his audition, Weinger sent a homemade audition tape as Aladdin, with his mother playing the Genie, and after several callbacks, found out six months later that he had been cast as the title character. Aladdin&#x27;s supervising animator was Glen Keane.
**Brad Kane provides Aladdin&#x27;s singing voice.
*Robin Williams as the Genie, a hyperactive jinni with great power that can be exercised only when his master wishes it. He serves as the film&#x27;s comic relief. Clements and Musker had written the role of the Genie for Robin Williams, but when met with resistance, created a reel of a Williams&#x27;s stand-up animation of the Genie. The directors asked Eric Goldberg, the Genie&#x27;s supervising animator, to animate the character over one of Williams&#x27;s old stand-up comedy routines to pitch the idea to the actor. The resulting test, in which Williams&#x27;s stand-up about schizophrenia was translated to the Genie growing another head to argue with himself, made Williams &quot;laugh his ass off&quot;, and convinced him to sign for the role. Williams&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Aladdin&quot; marked the beginning of a transition in animation to use celebrity voice actors rather than specifically trained voice actors.
**Williams also voices a peddler who appears at the beginning of the film, whom the directors intended to be the same Genie in disguise narrating the story. The peddler&#x27;s singing voice was provided by Bruce Adler.
*Linda Larkin as Jasmine, the beautiful princess of Agrabah and daughter of the Sultan, who is bored with life in the royal palace. Larkin was chosen for the role of Jasmine nine months after her audition, and had to adjust and lower her high-pitched voice to reach the voice that the filmmakers were looking for in the character. Jasmine&#x27;s supervising animator was Mark Henn.
**Lea Salonga provides Jasmine&#x27;s singing voice.
*Jonathan Freeman as Jafar, the power-hungry Grand vizier of Agrabah. Freeman was the first actor cast, and spent 21 months recording his dialogue. He eventually readjusted his voice after Weinger and Larkin were cast, as he felt that &quot;Jafar had to be seen as a real threat to Aladdin and Jasmine&quot;, as he was originally envisioned as an irritable character, but the directors decided that a calm villain would be scarier. Jafar&#x27;s supervising animator was Andreas Deja, while Jafar&#x27;s beggar and snake forms were animated by Kathy Zielinski.
*Frank Welker as Abu, Aladdin&#x27;s kleptomaniac pet monkey with a falsetto voice. Welker also voices Jasmine&#x27;s tiger, Rajah, and the Cave of Wonders. Duncan Marjoribanks was the supervising animator for Abu, Aaron Blaise was the supervising animator for Rajah, and Goldberg was the supervising animator for the Cave of Wonders.
*Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Jafar&#x27;s sardonic, hot-tempered parrot sidekick. Will Finn was the supervising animator for Iago.
*Douglas Seale as the Sultan, the naïve yet friendly ruler of Agrabah, who desperately tries to find a suitor for his daughter, Jasmine. The Sultan&#x27;s supervising animator was David Pruiksma.
*Jim Cummings as Razoul, the Captain of the Guards. Phil Young and Chris Wahl animated him and the other guards.
*Charlie Adler as Gazeem, a thief who Jafar sends into the Cave of Wonders at the beginning of the film, but is trapped inside for being unworthy. Gazeem was animated by T. Daniel Hofstedt.
*Corey Burton as Prince Achmed, an arrogant prince who Jasmine rejects as a suitor.

== Production ==
=== Script and development ===
In 1988, lyricist Howard Ashman pitched the idea of an animated musical adaptation of Aladdin. Ashman had written a 40-page film treatment, remaining faithful to the plot and characters of the original story but envisioned as a campy 1930s-style musical with a popular 1930s-style Genie. With partner, Alan Menken, Ashman composed several songs and added original characters to the story, such as Aladdin&#x27;s friends, Babkak, Omar and Kassim.

However, Michael Eisner did not think that a story set in the Middle East would be commercially appealing, and their project was removed from active development. Ashman and Menken were soon recruited to compose songs for &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. Linda Woolverton, who had also worked on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, used their treatment and developed a draft with inspired elements from &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;, such as a villain named Jaf&#x27;far, an aged sidekick retired human thief named Abu, and a human handmaiden for the princess.

Directors Ron Clements and John Musker joined the production, picking &quot;Aladdin&quot; from three projects offered; the other two were an adaptation of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and &quot;King of the Jungle&quot;, which eventually became &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Before Ashman&#x27;s death in March 1991, he and Menken composed &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, &quot;Friend Like Me&quot;, &quot;Prince Ali&quot; and Ashman&#x27;s last song, &quot;Humiliate the Boy&quot;.

Musker and Clements wrote a draft of the screenplay, and delivered a story reel to studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg in April 1991. Katzenberg thought that the script &quot;didn&#x27;t engage&quot;, and on a day known by the staff as &quot;Black Friday&quot;, he demanded that the entire story be rewritten without rescheduling the film&#x27;s November 25, 1992, release date. Katzenberg requested for Clements and Musker to not be heavily dependent on Ashman&#x27;s vision, and the removal of Aladdin&#x27;s mother, remarking, &quot;Eighty-six the mother. The mom&#x27;s a zero.&quot;

Katzenberg also influenced changing the plot element about Jasmine&#x27;s marriage, which originally had her to be married by age sixteen as required by law, to remove the age—the Sultan says only, &quot;your next birthday&quot;—and make it more specific that her suitor needed to be a prince, which would also set up the ending in which the Sultan, inspired by Aladdin&#x27;s altruism, changes the law to make it legal for Jasmine to able to marry anyone she deems worthy.

Screenwriting duo Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were brought in to rework the story, and the changes they made included the removal of Aladdin&#x27;s mother, the strengthening of the character of Princess Jasmine, and the deletion of several of Ashman and Menken&#x27;s songs. Aladdin&#x27;s personality was rewritten to be &quot;a little rougher, like a young Harrison Ford&quot;; the parrot, Iago, originally conceived as an uptight British archetype, was reworked to a comic role after the filmmakers saw Gilbert Gottfried in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;, who was cast for the role. By October 1991, Katzenberg was satisfied with the new version of &quot;Aladdin&quot;. As with Woolverton&#x27;s screenplay, several characters and plot elements were based on &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;, although the location of the film was changed from Baghdad to the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah due to the Gulf War. Because the war prevented them from travelling to Baghdad for research, most of their research took place at the Saudi Arabian expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

According to a 1994 article in &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Katzenberg asked Thomas Schumacher, an openly gay producer, if any of the gay references in the film offended him, such as a scene in which the Genie becomes an &quot;effeminate clothier&quot;, and another in which he tells Aladdin, &quot;I really like you too, kid, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to pick out curtains with you&quot;. Schumacher responded that such references were in &quot;good fun&quot;, remarking that &quot;I know we all argue amongst ourselves, but why try to deny the fact that swishy fashion designers exist? They do! What are we running from? Show me ten hairdressers; I&#x27;ll show you eight gay men.&quot;

=== Design and animation ===
The design for most characters is based on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, which production designer, Richard Vander Wende, also considered appropriate to the theme, due to similarities to the flowing and swooping lines found in Arabic calligraphy. Jafar&#x27;s design was not based on Hirschfeld&#x27;s work, because Jafar&#x27;s supervising animator, Andreas Deja, wanted the character to be contrasting. Each character was animated alone, with the animators consulting with each other to make scenes with interrelating characters.

Because Aladdin&#x27;s animator, Glen Keane, was working in the California branch of Walt Disney Feature Animation, and Jasmine&#x27;s animator, Mark Henn, was in Florida at Disney-MGM Studios, they had to frequently phone, fax or send designs and discs to each other. The animators filmed monkeys at the San Francisco Zoo to study their movements for Abu&#x27;s character. Iago&#x27;s supervising animator, Will Finn, tried to incorporate some aspects of Gottfried&#x27;s appearance into the parrot&#x27;s design, especially his semi-closed eyes and the always-appearing teeth. Some aspects of the Sultan were inspired by the Wizard of Oz, to create a bumbling authority figure.

Andreas Deja, Jafar&#x27;s supervising animator, tried to incorporate Jonathan Freeman&#x27;s facial expressions and gesturing into the character. Animator Randy Cartwright described working on the Magic Carpet as challenging, since it is only a rectangular shape that expresses itself through pantomime—&quot;It&#x27;s sort of like acting by origami&quot;. Cartwright kept folding a piece of cloth while animating to see how to position the Carpet. After the character animation was done, the carpet&#x27;s surface design was applied digitally.
Designed by a team led by supervising animator, Glen Keane, Aladdin was initially going to be as young as thirteen, and was originally made to resemble actor Michael J. Fox. During production, it was decided that the design was too boyish and lacked appeal, so the character was made &quot;seventeen to eighteen&quot;, and redesigned to add elements derived from actor Tom Cruise and Calvin Klein models.

For the scenery design, various architectural elements seen in 19th-century orientalist paintings and photographs of the Arab world were used for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney&#x27;s animated films from the 1940s and &#x27;50s and the 1940 film &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;. The coloring was done with the computerized CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality—the protagonists use light colors, such as blue, the antagonists darker ones, such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color, yellow. Computer animation was used for several elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene in which Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave. Some of the software that was used was Pixar&#x27;s RenderMan.

Musker and Clements created the Genie with Robin Williams in mind; although Katzenberg suggested actors such as John Candy, Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy, Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role. Williams came for voice recording sessions during breaks while filming two films he was making at the time, &quot;Hook&quot; and &quot;Toys&quot;. Unusual for an animated film, much of Williams&#x27;s dialogue was ad-libbed. For some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It is estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for the Genie, reviewed Williams&#x27;s recorded dialogue, and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match.

The producers added many in-jokes and references to Disney&#x27;s previous works in the film, such as a &quot;cameo appearance&quot; from directors, Clements and Musker, and drawing some characters based on Disney workers. Beast, Sebastian and Pinocchio make brief appearances, and the wardrobe of the Genie at the end of the film—a Goofy hat, a Hawaiian shirt, and sandals—are a reference to a short film that Robin Williams did for the Disney-MGM Studios tour in the late 1980s.

=== Robin Williams&#x27;s conflicts with the studio ===

In gratitude for his success with Touchstone Pictures&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot;, Robin Williams voiced the Genie for SAG scale pay ($75,000) instead of his usual asking fee of $8 million, on the condition that neither his name nor image be used for marketing, and that his character take no more than 25% of space on advertising artwork, since Williams&#x27;s film, &quot;Toys&quot;, was scheduled for release one month after &quot;Aladdin&quot;″s debut. For financial reasons, the studio reneged on both counts, especially in poster art, by having the Genie in 25% of the image but having other major and supporting characters portrayed considerably smaller. The Disney Hyperion book, &quot;Aladdin: The Making of an Animated Film&quot;, lists both of Williams&#x27;s characters, &quot;the Peddler&quot; and &quot;the Genie&quot;, ahead of main characters, but was forced to refer to him as only &quot;the actor signed to play the Genie&quot;.

Disney, while not using Williams&#x27;s name in commercials as per the contract, used his voice for the Genie in the commercials and used the Genie character to sell toys and fast food tie-ins, without having to pay Williams additional money. Williams unhappily quipped at the time, &quot;You realize when you work for Disney why the mouse has only four fingers--because he can’t pick up a check.&quot; Williams explained to &quot;New York&quot; magazine that his previous &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; merchandising was different because &quot;the image is theirs. But the voice, that&#x27;s me; I gave them myself. When it happened, I said, &#x27;You know I don&#x27;t do that.&#x27; And they [Disney] apologized; they said it was done by other people.&quot;

Disney attempted to assuage Williams by sending him a Pablo Picasso painting worth more than $1 million, but this move failed to repair the damaged relationship, as the painting was a self-portrait of Picasso as Vincent van Gogh, and apparently really &quot;clashed&quot; with the Williams&#x27;s wilder home decor. Williams refused to sign for the 1994 direct-to-video sequel &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;, and he was replaced by Dan Castellaneta as the Genie&#x27;s voice actor. When Jeffrey Katzenberg was replaced by Joe Roth as chairman at Walt Disney Studios, Roth organized a public apology to Williams. In turn, Williams would reprise the role in the second sequel, &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot;, in 1996.

=== Music ===

&quot;Aladdin&quot; was the third—after &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;—and final Disney film that Alan Menken and Howard Ashman had collaborated on, with Tim Rice as lyricist after Ashman had died in March 1991. Although fourteen songs were written for &quot;Aladdin&quot;, only seven are featured in the film, three by Ashman and four by Rice. Menken, Ashman and Rice were praised for creating a soundtrack that is &quot;consistently good, rivaling the best of Disney&#x27;s other animated musicals from the &#x27;90s&quot;.

The Special Edition soundtrack released in 2004 included four songs in early animation tests and a music video of one, &quot;Proud of Your Boy&quot;, performed by Clay Aiken, which also appears on the album, &quot;Disneymania 3&quot;. The pop duo version of the song, &quot;A Whole New World&quot;, performed by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle, which plays over the end credits, is, , the only Disney song to win a Grammy Award for Song of the Year.

== Themes ==

The filmmakers thought that the moral message of the original tale was inappropriate, and decided to &quot;put a spin on it&quot; by making the fulfillment of wishes seem like a great solution, but eventually becoming a problem. Another major theme was avoiding an attempt to be what the person is not—both Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble pretending to be different people, and Prince Ali&#x27;s persona fails to impress Jasmine, who falls for Aladdin only when she finds out who he truly is. Being &quot;imprisoned&quot; is also presented, a fate that occurs to most of the characters—Aladdin and Jasmine are limited by their lifestyles, while the Genie is attached to his lamp, and Jafar to the Sultan—and is represented visually by the prison-like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace and the scene involving caged birds, which Jasmine eventually frees. Jasmine is also depicted as a different type of Disney Princess, being rebellious against the royal life and the social structure.

== Release ==
=== Box office ===
A large promotion campaign preceded &quot;Aladdin&quot;″s debut in theaters, with the film&#x27;s trailer attached to most Disney VHS releases (including &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; in April 1992 and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in October that year), and numerous tie-ins and licensees being released. &quot;Aladdin&quot; was released on November 11, 1992, in two theaters (the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles and the City Cinemas 1, 2 and 3rd Avenue in New York City), and grossed $196,664 in its first 5 days. The film expanded to 1,131 theaters on November 25, 1992, grossing $19.2 million for the weekend, finishing second at the U.S. box office, behind &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;. It took eight weeks for the film to surpass &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; as the most successful animated Disney film at the domestic box office (surpassed by &quot;The Lion King&quot; in 1994).

For its eighth week of release, &quot;Aladdin&quot; collected $15.6 million and reached the number one spot at the box office, beating &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;. By February 1993, it surpassed &quot;Batman Returns&quot; to become the highest-grossing 1992 film domestically. In the United States, the film held the top spot five times weekly and breaks the record for the week between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve, with $32.2 million during its 22-week run. &quot;Aladdin&quot; was the most successful film of 1992, grossing $217 million in the United States, and over $504 million worldwide. It was the biggest gross for an animated film until &quot;The Lion King&quot; two years later, and was the first full-length animated film to gross $200 million in the United States and Canada. Additionally, it was the first film to cross that mark since &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;.

Outside of the United States and Canada, the film grossed $200 million in 1993, and $250 million by January 1994. In Europe, &quot;Aladdin&quot; defeated &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; to become the continent&#x27;s box-office leader for the week of November 26. It set an opening weekend record in South Africa. By 2002, the film grossed $287 million overseas and $504 million worldwide. It sold an estimated 52.4million tickets in the United States and Canada. When adjusted for inflation (in 2022 dollars), its domestic gross totaled $491.4million.

=== Home media ===
The film was first released in VHS on September 29, 1993, as part of the Walt Disney Classics line, although it was not officially advertised until October 1. In its first three days of availability, &quot;Aladdin&quot; sold 10.8 million copies, setting the fastest sales record and grossing about in the United States. In less than three weeks, the VHS release of &quot;Aladdin&quot; sold more than 16million units and grossed over in the United States. On release of the Sega Genesis video game adaptation in November, &quot;Aladdin&quot; sold approximately 30 million home video units, earning more than in the United States. It was the best-selling home video release until a record broken by &quot;The Lion King&quot;. This VHS edition entered moratorium on April 30, 1994. A THX-certified widescreen LaserDisc was issued on September 21, 1994, and a Spanish-dubbed VHS for the American market was released on April 14, 1995. In Japan, 2.2million home video units were sold by 1995.

On October 5, 2004, &quot;Aladdin&quot; was rereleased onto VHS and for the first time released on DVD, as part of Disney&#x27;s Platinum Edition line. The DVD release featured retouched and cleaned-up animation, which had been prepared for the film&#x27;s planned but ultimately cancelled IMAX reissue in 2003, and a second disc with bonus features. Accompanied by a $19 million marketing campaign, the DVD sold about 3 million units in its first month. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008 with its sequels.

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on a Diamond Edition Blu-ray on October 13, 2015. The film was released on Digital HD on September 29, 2015. In its first week of release on home media in the United States, the film topped the Blu-ray sales chart and debuted at number 2 at the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales behind the disaster film, &quot;San Andreas&quot;. The film&#x27;s Blu-ray release sold 1.81million units and grossed $39 million, .

&quot;Aladdin&quot; was re-released on HD and 4K digital download on August 27, 2019, with a physical media re-release on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray on September 10, 2019, as part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
Upon release, &quot;Aladdin&quot; received positive reviews from film critics. The review aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes, reports that of critics give the film a positive review, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;A highly entertaining entry in Disney&#x27;s renaissance era, &quot;Aladdin&quot; is beautifully drawn, with near-classic songs and a cast of scene-stealing characters.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade, on a scale of A+ to F.

Most critics praised Robin Williams&#x27;s performance as the Genie, with Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declaring that children &quot;needn&#x27;t know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking to understand how funny he is&quot;. Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the cast of characters, describing the expressive magic carpet as &quot;its most remarkable accomplishment&quot;, and considered that &quot;&quot;Aladdin&quot; overcomes most story flaws thanks to sheer technical virtuosity&quot;.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that the film&#x27;s comedic aspect made it accessible to both children and adults, a vision shared with Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, who also said that &quot;kids are still going to be entranced by the magic and adventure&quot;. Warner Bros. Cartoons director Chuck Jones called the film &quot;the funniest feature ever made&quot;, and James Berardinelli gave the film three and a half stars out of four, praising the &quot;crisp visuals and wonderful song-and-dance numbers&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film 3 stars out of 4, and commented that Williams and animation &quot;were born for one another.&quot; However, he considered the music to be inferior to &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and claimed that Aladdin and Jasmine were &quot;pale and routine&quot;. He criticized what he saw as the film&#x27;s use of ethnic stereotypes, writing, &quot;Most of the Arab characters have exaggerated facial characteristics—hooked noses, glowering brows, thick lips—but Aladdin and the princess look like white American teenagers.&quot;

The film did not go without criticism. In a scathing review, Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described the film as racist, ridiculous, and a &quot;narcissistic circus act&quot; from Robin Williams.

=== Accolades ===
=== Controversies ===
One of the verses of the opening song &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, in which the speaker uses the lyric &quot;where they cut off your ear if they don&#x27;t like your face&quot; to describe his homeland, was altered to &quot;where it&#x27;s flat and immense and the heat is intense&quot; following complaints from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC). The revision first appeared on the 1993 video release. The original lyric was intact on the initial CD soundtrack release, but the rereleases use the edited lyric. The Broadway adaptation also uses the edited line. The subsequent line, however, &quot;It&#x27;s barbaric, but hey, it&#x27;s home&quot;, was left intact.

The film has also been subject to criticism for its use of Orientalist stereotypes that depict Arab societies as exotic and foreign. The ADC has pointed out that the characters in the movie that the viewer is supposed to identify and sympathize with are generally presented with more white features, while the villains are presented with more Arab features. Other people have pointed out that the movie is quite inaccurate in its depictions of Arab societies. The main palace is inspired by Mughal architecture, but many of the clothes are Turkish in origin, and the outside environment is closer to that of the Arabian Desert.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Aladdin&quot; in a list of the most controversial films in history due to this incident. The number has been described in reviews as &quot;simultaneously glamorizing and barbarizing the Arab world&quot;. The ADC also complained about the portrayal of the lead characters, Aladdin and Jasmine. They accused the filmmakers of anglicizeing their features and giving them Anglo-American accents, in contrast to the other characters, which have &quot;foreign accents, grotesque facial features, and appear villainous or greedy&quot;. In October 2020, in response to the criticism and in acknowledgment of racial stereotypes in the wake of the George Floyd protests, Disney added a disclaimer to many of their features, including &quot;Aladdin&quot;, on Disney+, acknowledging the content as racist.

Another scene in which Aladdin is threatened by the tiger Rajah on the palace balcony was controversial as well. In the scene, some viewers reported hearing Aladdin quietly utter the phrase, &quot;Good teenagers, take off your clothes&quot;, which they considered a subliminal reference to promiscuity. However, according to the commentary track on the 2004 DVD, while Musker and Clements did admit that Scott Weinger ad-libbed during the scene, they claimed that &quot;we did not record that, we would not record that&quot;, and said that the line was, &quot;Good tiger, take off and go...&quot;, and that the word, &quot;tiger&quot;, is overlapped by Rajah&#x27;s snarl. After the word &quot;tiger&quot;, a second voice can be heard that can be assumed to have been accidentally grafted into the soundtrack. Later editions of the movie edit the line to avoid further speculation.

Animation enthusiasts have noticed similarities between &quot;Aladdin&quot; and Richard Williams&#x27;s unfinished film, &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot; (also known as &quot;The Princess and the Cobbler&quot; under Allied Filmmakers and &quot;Arabian Knight&quot; under Miramax Films). These similarities include a similar plot, similar characters, scenes, and background designs, and the antagonist Zig-Zag&#x27;s resemblance to character design and mannerisms to the Genie and Jafar. Although &quot;Aladdin&quot; was released first, &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot; initially began production in the 1960s, and was mired in difficulties, including financial problems, copyright issues, story revisions and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work. The late release, coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film, has sometimes resulted in &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot; being labeled a rip-off of &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

==Legacy==
Alongside its role in the Disney Renaissance, &quot;Aladdin&quot; is often credited as the catalyst in the rise of casting film stars as voice actors in Hollywood-animated films with the success of Robin Williams&#x27;s Genie performance. Entertainment writer Scott Meslow wrote that, compared with the character of Aladdin, &quot;Williams&#x27;s Genie is the character audiences responded to, and—more importantly to Disney—its most marketable character by far&quot;, which he concluded led to the &quot;celebrification&quot; of later animated films, such as &quot;Shark Tale&quot; and &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;.

===Sequels and spin-offs===
Before the theatrical release of &quot;Aladdin&quot;, Disney commissioned Tad Stones and Alan Zaslove to produce an animated series of &quot;Aladdin&quot;, following the recently developed one of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Stones liked the character of Iago and wanted him in the cast, so he came up with an idea for a followup story that would free him from Jafar to join Aladdin. Stones suggested turning it into a wholesale direct-to-video sequel, as opposed to an hourlong television special, and &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; was released in June 1994. The film saw the debut of a new character, Abis Mal, voiced by Jason Alexander, and all of the original cast returned, except for Robin Williams, replaced by Dan Castellaneta, and Douglas Seale, replaced by Val Bettin.

The plot focuses mainly on Jafar seeking revenge on Aladdin. However, this time, with Iago on Aladdin&#x27;s side, Abis Mal becomes Jafar&#x27;s new henchman. Aside from a preview on The Disney Channel in early 1994, the &quot;Aladdin&quot; TV series followed in September on the syndicated The Disney Afternoon block. The episodes focused on Aladdin&#x27;s adventures after the events of the second film. In 1996, the final sequel to &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot; was released on video. The story concludes as Aladdin and Jasmine are about to be married and Aladdin discovers that his father is still alive, but is the king of all thieves in Agrabah.

The &quot;Aladdin&quot; characters made a crossover with &quot;&quot;, and were featured as guests in the television series, &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, and related works to those series—Jafar was the leader of the villains in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s House of Villains&quot;.

The film also inspired a Disney On Ice presentation, and two attractions in Disney&#x27;s theme parks: &quot;The Magic Carpets of Aladdin&quot;, a Dumbo the Flying Elephant-like ride at both Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World Resort, Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Resort Paris and Tokyo DisneySea;, the show &quot;Disney&#x27;s Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular&quot; at Disney&#x27;s California Adventure Park and The Magic Lamp Theater at Tokyo DisneySea.

===Video games===
With the film&#x27;s release, three different video games based on &quot;Aladdin&quot; were released, one by Virgin Interactive for the Mega Drive, Game Boy (ported to the Game Boy Color), Nintendo Entertainment System, Amiga and IBM PC compatibles; another by SIMS for the Game Gear and Master System; and a third by Capcom for the Super NES and Genesis (ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2002).

The television series inspired another game by Argonaut Games, entitled &quot;Aladdin: Nasira&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and released in 2000 for the PlayStation and PC. Also, in 2004 Vivendi Universal released &quot;Disney&#x27;s Aladdin Chess Adventures&quot;, a chess computer game with the Aladdin license.

The &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series features a playable &quot;Aladdin&quot; world known as Agrabah. In &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, the plotline is loosely related to the storyline of the original film. In &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, it is a mixture of &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;. The Genie is also a recurring summon in the series.

=== Live-action adaptation ===

On July 15, 2015, the studio announced the development of a live-action comedy adventure prequel called &quot;Genies&quot;. The film was being written by Mark Swift and Damian Shannon, while Tripp Vinson was on board to produce via his Vinson Films banner. It was intended to serve as a lead to the live-action &quot;Aladdin&quot; film. On November 8, Disney revealed that it had originally planned to use Robin Williams&#x27;s unused lines from the 1991–92 recording sessions for the film, but that his will prohibited the studio from using his likeness for 25 years after his death in 2014.

In October 2016, it was reported that Disney was developing a live-action adaptation of &quot;Aladdin&quot;, with Guy Ritchie signed to direct the film. John August wrote the script, which retains the musical elements of the original film, while Dan Lin is attached as producer. Lin revealed that they were looking for a diverse cast. In April 2017, Will Smith entered talks to play the Genie. Alan Menken said that filming was slated to begin in August 2017.

Production had originally been scheduled to begin in July, but was delayed due to Disney having trouble finding the right people to play Aladdin and Jasmine. British actress Naomi Scott and Indian actress Tara Sutaria were being considered to play Jasmine. For the role of Aladdin, British actors Riz Ahmed and Dev Patel were initially considered, but it was decided that a newcomer should be cast in the role. In July 2017, it was announced that Egyptian-Canadian actor Mena Massoud had been cast as Aladdin, Scott as Jasmine, and Smith as the Genie. At the 2017 D23 Expo, Menken announced that he would be cowriting new songs for the film with Academy Award winners Pasek and Paul, while Vanessa Taylor would rewrite the script.

In August 2017, Marwan Kenzari, Nasim Pedrad and Numan Acar joined the cast as Jafar, Dalia and Hakim, respectively. The following month, Billy Magnussen and Navid Negahban were cast as Prince Anders and the Sultan, respectively. Filming began September 6, 2017, at Longcross Studios and concluded January 24, 2018. The film was released May 24, 2019.

<doc id="73186" wikidata="Q3509240" url="?curid=73186" title="Numbers in Germanic paganism">
<text>The numbers three, nine, and other multiples of three are significant numbers in Germanic paganism. Both numbers (and multiples thereof) appear throughout surviving attestations of ancient Germanic folklore, in both mythology and Germanic paganism. Along with the number 27, both numbers also figure into the lunar Germanic calendar.

==Examples==
Emphasis on the numbers three, nine, and multiples of three occur frequently in the ancient Germanic record. Examples include:

===West Germanic===
&quot;Old English&quot;
*&quot;Æcerbot&quot;: A charm that describes a ritual wherein the speaker should bow nine times to the east.
*&quot;Nine Herbs Charm&quot;: A charm focused on nine plants, using the number nine extensively and featuring the Old English extension of the Germanic god Odin.

&quot;Old High German&quot;
* Merseburg Charms: Two Old High German charms stemming from the pagan period mentioning at least six pagan Germanic deities and other beings. According to Patricia Giangrosso, &quot;the second Merseburg Charm is the only medieval German charm to specify gods from the pagan, Germanic past&quot; and &quot;no other Old High German or Middle High German charms show so clearly a structure based on the number three. This is especially striking in the second charm.&quot;

===North Germanic===
The North Germanic record frequently mentions the numbers three, nine, and multiples of three. A few examples of these many occurrences in Norse mythology include:
*Odin&#x27;s self-sacrifice where he hangs for nine nights on a &quot;windy tree&quot; (&quot;Hávamál&quot;)
*The &quot;nine worlds&quot; () associated with Yggdrasil (&quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;)
*Nine Mothers of Heimdallr
*Nine Daughters of Ægir and Rán
*The god Thor&#x27;s foretold nine steps before he dies at Ragnarök
Exterior to texts on mythology, accounts of Temple of Uppsala by Adam of Bremen in what is today Sweden and of Lejre in today&#x27;s Denmark by Thietmar of Merseburg purport that pagan sacrificial feasts occurred at these locations lasting nine days, where &quot;supposedly nine victims were sacrificed each day&quot;. According to Gardeła, &quot;Leaving aside the problem of the historical veracity of these two Latin accounts, as well as the lack of tangible traces of violent and large-scale sacrificial acts in the archaeological record at Uppsala and Lejre, the fact that both Adam and Thietmar consistently refer to the number nine in ritual contexts leads to the supposition that the chroniclers wove their stories around an authentic and widespread idea rooted in the Viking Age.&quot;

Ibn Fadlān&#x27;s eyewitness account of the Viking Age Scandinavian Rus&#x27; in the first half of the 10th century on the Volga river mentions that the deceased Rus&#x27; leader&#x27;s body was ritually left in a chamber for nine days before being set ablaze on a burning ship with a variety of goods and the body of a female slave.

===Archaeology===
A variety of objects found in the Germanic cultural sphere have been interpreted by scholars as reflecting a particular focus on the number nine. These include:
* Miniatures with nine studs found in a square or circular pattern.
* The valknut: According to scholar Leszek Gardeła, &quot;Probably the most vivid manifestation of the number nine motif in the material culture of the Viking Age comes in the form of the so-called valknútr, a symbol carved in wood, metal and stone which usually takes the form of three inter-locking triangles (giving a total of nine triangle points).&quot;

==Scholastic reception==
According to scholar Rudolf Simek, &quot;apart from the number three, which played a role in many other cultures, nine is the mythical number of the Germanic tribes. Documentation for the number nine is found in both myth and cult.&quot; In addition to the importance of three and nine, Simek highlights the importance of the number 27 (27/3=9) for the Germanic lunar calendar.

Scholars Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees note that, &quot;the number nine plays a significant role in Germanic folklore: charms frequently contain nine ingredients or specify a ritual to be performed nine times&quot;. The two highlight the instruction in the Old English &quot;Æcerbot&quot; for the speaker to &quot;turn to the east and bow nine times&quot;, the &quot;Nine Herbs Charm&quot;, and a variety of other items as examples.

As highlighted by scholar Leszek Gardeła (National Museum of Denmark), &quot;surviving sagas and poems reveal that certain numbers held special significance among Norse societies. This was certainly the case with the numbers three and nine which are frequently mentioned in connection with the sphere of religion and/or ritual practice.&quot;

<text>The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican City (), or simply Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica (; ), is a church of the Italian High Renaissance located in Vatican City, an independent microstate enclaved within the city of Rome, Italy. It was initially planned in the 15th century by Pope Nicholas V and then Pope Julius II to replace the ageing Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, which was built in the fourth century by Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Construction of the present basilica began on 18 April 1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626.

Designed principally by Donato Bramante, Michelangelo, and Carlo Maderno, with piazza and fittings by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter&#x27;s is one of the most renowned works of Italian Renaissance architecture and is the largest church in the world by interior measure. While it is neither the mother church of the Catholic Church nor the cathedral of the Diocese of Rome (these equivalent titles being held by the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome), St. Peter&#x27;s is regarded as one of the holiest Catholic shrines. It has been described as &quot;holding a unique position in the Christian world&quot;, and as &quot;the greatest of all churches of Christendom.&quot;

Catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial site of Saint Peter, chief among Jesus&#x27;s apostles and also the first Bishop of Rome (Pope). Saint Peter&#x27;s tomb is directly below the high altar of the basilica, also known as the &quot;Altar of the Confession&quot;. For this reason, many popes, cardinals and bishops have been interred at St. Peter&#x27;s since the Early Christian period.

St. Peter&#x27;s is famous as a place of pilgrimage and for its liturgical functions. The pope presides at a number of liturgies throughout the year both within the basilica or the adjoining St. Peter&#x27;s Square; these liturgies draw audiences numbering from 15,000 to over 80,000 people. St. Peter&#x27;s has many historical associations, with the early Christian Church, the Papacy, the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation and numerous artists, especially Michelangelo. As a work of architecture, it is regarded as the greatest building of its age. 

St. Peter&#x27;s is ranked second, after the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, amongst the four churches in the world that hold the rank of major papal basilica, all four of which are in Rome, and is also one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome. Contrary to popular misconception, it is not a cathedral because it is not the seat of a bishop.

==Overview==

St. Peter&#x27;s is a church built in the Renaissance style located in the Vatican City west of the River Tiber and near the Janiculum Hill and Hadrian&#x27;s Mausoleum. Its central dome dominates the skyline of Rome. The basilica is approached via St. Peter&#x27;s Square, a forecourt in two sections, both surrounded by tall colonnades. The first space is oval and the second trapezoidal. The façade of the basilica, with a giant order of columns, stretches across the end of the square and is approached by steps on which stand two statues of the first-century apostles to Rome, Saints Peter and Paul.

The basilica is cruciform in shape, with an elongated nave in the Latin cross form but the early designs were for a centrally planned structure and this is still in evidence in the architecture. The central space is dominated both externally and internally by one of the largest domes in the world. The entrance is through a narthex, or entrance hall, which stretches across the building. One of the decorated bronze doors leading from the narthex is the Holy Door, only opened during jubilees.

The interior dimensions are vast when compared to other churches. One author wrote: &quot;Only gradually does it dawn upon us – as we watch people draw near to this or that monument, strangely they appear to shrink; they are, of course, dwarfed by the scale of everything in the building. This in its turn overwhelms us.&quot;

The nave which leads to the central dome is in three bays, with piers supporting a barrel vault, the highest of any church. The nave is framed by wide aisles which have a number of chapels off them. There are also chapels surrounding the dome. Moving around the basilica in a clockwise direction they are: The Baptistery, the Chapel of the Presentation of the Virgin, the larger Choir Chapel, the altar of the Transfiguration, the Clementine Chapel with the altar of Saint Gregory, the Sacristy Entrance, the Altar of the Lie, the left transept with altars to the Crucifixion of Saint Peter, Saint Joseph and Saint Thomas, the altar of the Sacred Heart, the Chapel of the Madonna of Column, the altar of Saint Peter and the Paralytic, the apse with the Chair of Saint Peter, the altar of Saint Peter raising Tabitha, the altar of St. Petronilla, the altar of the Archangel Michael, the altar of the Navicella, the right transept with altars of Saint Erasmus, Saints Processo and Martiniano, and Saint Wenceslas, the altar of St. Jerome, the altar of Saint Basil, the Gregorian Chapel with the altar of the Madonna of Succour, the larger Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, the Chapel of Saint Sebastian and the Chapel of the Pietà. The Monuments, in a clockwise direction, are to: Maria Clementina Sobieska, The Stuarts, Benedict XV, John XXIII, St. Pius X, Innocent VIII, Leo XI, Innocent XI, Pius VII, Pius VIII, Alexander VII, Alexander VIII, Paul III, Urban VIII, Clement X, Clement XIII, Benedict XIV, St Peter (Bronze Statue), Gregory XVI, Gregory XIV, Gregory XIII, Matilda of Canossa,Innocent XII, Pius XII, Pius XI, Christina of Sweden, and Leo XII. At the heart of the basilica, beneath the high altar, is the &quot;Confessio&quot; or &quot;Chapel of the Confession&quot;, in reference to the confession of faith by St. Peter, which led to his martyrdom. Two curving marble staircases lead to this underground chapel at the level of the Constantinian church and immediately above the purported burial place of Saint Peter.

The entire interior of St. Peter&#x27;s is lavishly decorated with marble, reliefs, architectural sculpture and gilding. The basilica contains a large number of tombs of popes and other notable people, many of which are considered outstanding artworks. There are also a number of sculptures in niches and chapels, including Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Pietà&quot;. The central feature is a baldachin, or canopy over the Papal Altar, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The apse culminates in a sculptural ensemble, also by Bernini, and containing the symbolic &quot;Chair of Saint Peter&quot;.

The American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson described St. Peter&#x27;s as &quot;an ornament of the earth ... the sublime of the beautiful.&quot;

== Status ==

St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica is one of the papal basilicas (previously styled &quot;patriarchal basilicas&quot;) and one of the four Major Basilicas of Rome the others (all of which are also Papal Basilicas) being the Basilicas of St. John Lateran, St. Mary Major, and St. Paul outside the Walls. The rank of major basilica confers on St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica precedence before all minor basilicas worldwide. However, unlike all the other Papal Major Basilicas, it is wholly within the territory, and thus the sovereign jurisdiction, of the Vatican City State, and not that of Italy.
It is the most prominent building in the Vatican City. Its dome is a feature of the skyline of Rome and covers an area of . One of the holiest sites of Christianity and Catholic Tradition, it is traditionally the burial site of its titular, St. Peter, who was the head of the twelve Apostles of Jesus and, according to tradition, the first Bishop of Antioch and later the first Bishop of Rome, rendering him the first Pope. Although the New Testament does not mention St. Peter&#x27;s martyrdom in Rome, tradition, based on the writings of the Fathers of the Church, holds that his tomb is below the baldachin and the altar of the Basilica in the &quot;Confession&quot;. For this reason, many Popes have, from the early years of the Church, been buried near Pope St. Peter in the necropolis beneath the Basilica. Construction of the current basilica, over the old Constantinian basilica, began on 18 April 1506 and finished in 1615. At length, on 18 November 1626 Pope Urban VIII solemnly dedicated the Basilica.

St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica is neither the Pope&#x27;s official seat nor first in rank among the Major Basilicas of Rome. This honour is held by the Pope&#x27;s cathedral, the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, the mother church of all churches in communion with the Catholic Church. However, St. Peter&#x27;s is functionally the Pope&#x27;s principal church, as most Papal liturgies and ceremonies take place there due to its size, proximity to the Papal residence, and location within the Vatican City proper. The &quot;Chair of Saint Peter&quot;, or cathedra, an ancient chair sometimes presumed to have been used by St. Peter himself, but which was a gift from Charles the Bald and used by many popes, symbolizes the continuing line of apostolic succession from St. Peter to the reigning Pope. It occupies an elevated position in the apse of the Basilica, supported symbolically by the Doctors of the Church and enlightened symbolically by the Holy Spirit.

As one of the constituent structures of the historically and architecturally significant Vatican City, St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984 under criteria (i), (ii), (iv), and (vi). With an exterior area of , an interior area of , St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica is the largest Christian church building in the world by the two latter metrics and the second largest by the first . The top of its dome, at , also places it as the second tallest building in Rome . The dome&#x27;s soaring height placed it among the tallest buildings of the Old World, and it continues to hold the title of tallest dome in the world. Though the largest dome in the world by diameter at the time of its completion, it no longer holds this distinction.

==History==
===Saint Peter&#x27;s burial site===
After the crucifixion of Jesus, it is recorded in the Biblical book of the Acts of the Apostles that one of his twelve disciples, Simon known as Saint Peter, a fisherman from Galilee, took a leadership position among Jesus&#x27; followers and was of great importance in the founding of the Christian Church. The name Peter is &quot;Petrus&quot; in Latin and &quot;Petros&quot; in Greek, deriving from &quot;petra&quot; which means &quot;stone&quot; or &quot;rock&quot; in Greek, and is the literal translation of the Aramaic &quot;Kepa&quot;, the name given to Simon by Jesus. (, and see )

Catholic tradition holds that Peter, after a ministry of thirty-four years, travelled to Rome and met his martyrdom there along with Paul on 13 October 64 AD during the reign of the Roman Emperor Nero. His execution was one of the many martyrdoms of Christians following the Great Fire of Rome. According to Jerome, Peter was crucified head downwards, by his own request because he considered himself unworthy to die in the same manner as Jesus. The crucifixion took place near an ancient Egyptian obelisk in the Circus of Nero. The obelisk now stands in St. Peter&#x27;s Square and is revered as a &quot;witness&quot; to Peter&#x27;s death. It is one of several ancient Obelisks of Rome.

According to tradition, Peter&#x27;s remains were buried just outside the Circus, on the Mons Vaticanus across the Via Cornelia from the Circus, less than from his place of death. The Via Cornelia was a road which ran east-to-west along the north wall of the Circus on land now covered by the southern portions of the Basilica and St. Peter&#x27;s Square. A shrine was built on this site some years later. Almost three hundred years later, Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica was constructed over this site.

The area now covered by the Vatican City had been a cemetery for some years before the Circus of Nero was built. It was a burial ground for the numerous executions in the Circus and contained many Christian burials as for many years after the burial of Saint Peter, many Christians chose to be buried near him.

In 1939, in the reign of Pope Pius XII, 10 years of archaeological research began under the crypt of the basilica in an area inaccessible since the ninth century. The excavations revealed the remains of shrines of different periods at different levels, from Clement VIII (1594) to Callixtus II (1123) and Gregory I (590–604), built over an aedicula containing fragments of bones that were folded in a tissue with gold decorations, tinted with the precious murex purple. Although it could not be determined with certainty that the bones were those of Peter, the rare vestments suggested a burial of great importance. On 23 December 1950, in his pre-Christmas radio broadcast to the world, Pope Pius XII announced the discovery of Saint Peter&#x27;s tomb.

===Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica===

Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica was the fourth-century church begun by the Emperor Constantine the Great between 319 and 333 AD. It was of typical basilical form, a wide nave and two aisles on each side and an apsidal end, with the addition of a transept or bema, giving the building the shape of a tau cross. It was over long, and the entrance was preceded by a large colonnaded atrium. This church had been built over the small shrine believed to mark the burial place of St. Peter, though the tomb was &quot;smashed&quot; in 846 AD. It contained a very large number of burials and memorials, including those of most of the popes from St. Peter to the 15th century. Like all of the earliest churches in Rome, both this church and its successor had the entrance to the east and the apse at the west end of the building. Since the construction of the current basilica, the name &quot;Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica&quot; has been used for its predecessor to distinguish the two buildings.

=== Plan to rebuild ===
By the end of the 15th century, having been neglected during the period of the Avignon Papacy, the old basilica had fallen into disrepair. It appears that the first pope to consider rebuilding or at least making radical changes was Pope Nicholas V (1447–1455). He commissioned work on the old building from Leone Battista Alberti and Bernardo Rossellino and also had Rossellino design a plan for an entirely new basilica, or an extreme modification of the old. His reign was frustrated by political problems and when he died, little had been achieved. He had, however, ordered the demolition of the Colosseum and by the time of his death, 2,522 cartloads of stone had been transported for use in the new building. The foundations were completed for a new transept and choir to form a domed Latin cross with the preserved nave and side aisles of the old basilica. Some walls for the choir had also been built.

Pope Julius II planned far more for St Peter&#x27;s than Nicholas V&#x27;s program of repair or modification. Julius was at that time planning his own tomb, which was to be designed and adorned with sculpture by Michelangelo and placed within St Peter&#x27;s. In 1505 Julius made a decision to demolish the ancient basilica and replace it with a monumental structure to house his enormous tomb and &quot;aggrandize himself in the popular imagination&quot;. A competition was held, and a number of the designs have survived at the Uffizi Gallery. A succession of popes and architects followed in the next 120 years, their combined efforts resulting in the present building. The scheme begun by Julius II continued through the reigns of Leo X (1513–1521), Adrian VI (1522–1523), Clement VII (1523–1534), Paul III (1534–1549), Julius III (1550–1555), Marcellus II (1555), Paul IV (1555–1559), Pius IV (1559–1565), Pius V (saint) (1565–1572), Gregory XIII (1572–1585), Sixtus V (1585–1590), Urban VII (1590), Gregory XIV (1590–1591), Innocent IX (1591), Clement VIII (1592–1605), Leo XI (1605), Paul V (1605–1621), Gregory XV (1621–1623), Urban VIII (1623–1644) and Innocent X (1644–1655).

===Financing with indulgences===
One method employed to finance the building of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica was the granting of indulgences in return for contributions. A major promoter of this method of fund-raising was Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg, who had to clear debts owed to the Roman Curia by contributing to the rebuilding program. To facilitate this, he appointed the German Dominican preacher Johann Tetzel, whose salesmanship provoked a scandal and led to the Protestant Reformation.

==Architecture==
===Successive plans=== 
Pope Julius&#x27; scheme for the grandest building in Christendom was the subject of a competition for which a number of entries remain intact in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. It was the design of Donato Bramante that was selected, and for which the foundation stone was laid in 1506. This plan was in the form of an enormous Greek Cross with a dome inspired by that of the huge circular Roman temple, the Pantheon. The main difference between Bramante&#x27;s design and that of the Pantheon is that where the dome of the Pantheon is supported by a continuous wall, that of the new basilica was to be supported only on four large piers. This feature was maintained in the ultimate design. Bramante&#x27;s dome was to be surmounted by a lantern with its own small dome but otherwise very similar in form to the Early Renaissance lantern of Florence Cathedral designed for Brunelleschi&#x27;s dome by Michelozzo.

Bramante had envisioned that the central dome would be surrounded by four lower domes at the diagonal axes. The equal chancel, nave and transept arms were each to be of two bays ending in an apse. At each corner of the building was to stand a tower, so that the overall plan was square, with the apses projecting at the cardinal points. Each apse had two large radial buttresses, which squared off its semi-circular shape.

When Pope Julius died in 1513, Bramante was replaced with Giuliano da Sangallo and Fra Giocondo, who both died in 1515 (Bramante himself having died the previous year). Raphael was confirmed as the architect of St. Peter&#x27;s on 1 August 1514. The main change in his plan is the nave of five bays, with a row of complex apsidal chapels off the aisles on either side. Raphael&#x27;s plan for the chancel and transepts made the squareness of the exterior walls more definite by reducing the size of the towers, and the semi-circular apses more clearly defined by encircling each with an ambulatory.

In 1520 Raphael also died, aged 37, and his successor Baldassare Peruzzi maintained changes that Raphael had proposed to the internal arrangement of the three main apses, but otherwise reverted to the Greek Cross plan and other features of Bramante. This plan did not go ahead because of various difficulties of both Church and state. In 1527 Rome was sacked and plundered by Emperor Charles V. Peruzzi died in 1536 without his plan being realized.

At this point Antonio da Sangallo the Younger submitted a plan which combines features of Peruzzi, Raphael and Bramante in its design and extends the building into a short nave with a wide façade and portico of dynamic projection. His proposal for the dome was much more elaborate of both structure and decoration than that of Bramante and included ribs on the exterior. Like Bramante, Sangallo proposed that the dome be surmounted by a lantern which he redesigned to a larger and much more elaborate form. Sangallo&#x27;s main practical contribution was to strengthen Bramante&#x27;s piers which had begun to crack.

On 1 January 1547 in the reign of Pope Paul III, Michelangelo, then in his seventies, succeeded Sangallo the Younger as &quot;Capomaestro&quot;, the superintendent of the building program at St Peter&#x27;s. He is to be regarded as the principal designer of a large part of the building as it stands today, and as bringing the construction to a point where it could be carried through. He did not take on the job with pleasure; it was forced upon him by Pope Paul, frustrated at the death of his chosen candidate, Giulio Romano and the refusal of Jacopo Sansovino to leave Venice. Michelangelo wrote, &quot;I undertake this only for the love of God and in honour of the Apostle.&quot; He insisted that he should be given a free hand to achieve the ultimate aim by whatever means he saw fit. 

===Michelangelo&#x27;s contribution===
Michelangelo took over a building site at which four piers, enormous beyond any constructed since ancient Roman times, were rising behind the remaining nave of the old basilica. He also inherited the numerous schemes designed and redesigned by some of the greatest architectural and engineering minds of the 16th century. There were certain common elements in these schemes. They all called for a dome to equal that engineered by Brunelleschi a century earlier and which has since dominated the skyline of Renaissance Florence, and they all called for a strongly symmetrical plan of either Greek Cross form, like the iconic St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice, or of a Latin Cross with the transepts of identical form to the chancel, as at Florence Cathedral.

Even though the work had progressed only a little in 40 years, Michelangelo did not simply dismiss the ideas of the previous architects. He drew on them in developing a grand vision. Above all, Michelangelo recognized the essential quality of Bramante&#x27;s original design. He reverted to the Greek Cross and, as Helen Gardner expresses it: &quot;Without destroying the centralising features of Bramante&#x27;s plan, Michelangelo, with a few strokes of the pen converted its snowflake complexity into massive, cohesive unity.&quot;

As it stands today, St. Peter&#x27;s has been extended with a nave by Carlo Maderno. It is the chancel end (the ecclesiastical &quot;Eastern end&quot;) with its huge centrally placed dome that is the work of Michelangelo. Because of its location within the Vatican State and because the projection of the nave screens the dome from sight when the building is approached from the square in front of it, the work of Michelangelo is best appreciated from a distance. What becomes apparent is that the architect has greatly reduced the clearly defined geometric forms of Bramante&#x27;s plan of a square with square projections, and also of Raphael&#x27;s plan of a square with semi-circular projections. Michelangelo has blurred the definition of the geometry by making the external masonry of massive proportions and filling in every corner with a small vestry or stairwell. The effect created is of a continuous wall surface that is folded or fractured at different angles, but lacks the right angles which usually define change of direction at the corners of a building. This exterior is surrounded by a giant order of Corinthian pilasters all set at slightly different angles to each other, in keeping with the ever-changing angles of the wall&#x27;s surface. Above them, the huge cornice ripples in a continuous band, giving the appearance of keeping the whole building in a state of compression.

===Dome: successive and final designs===
The dome of St. Peter&#x27;s rises to a total height of from the floor of the basilica to the top of the external cross. It is the tallest dome in the world. Its internal diameter is , slightly smaller than two of the three other huge domes that preceded it, those of the Pantheon of Ancient Rome, , and Florence Cathedral of the Early Renaissance, . It has a greater diameter by approximately than Constantinople&#x27;s Hagia Sophia church, completed in 537. It was to the domes of the Pantheon and Florence duomo that the architects of St. Peter&#x27;s looked for solutions as to how to go about building what was conceived, from the outset, as the greatest dome of Christendom.

====Bramante and Sangallo, 1506 and 1513====

The dome of the Pantheon stands on a circular wall with no entrances or windows except a single door. The whole building is as high as it is wide. Its dome is constructed in a single shell of concrete, made light by the inclusion of a large amount of the volcanic stones tuff and pumice. The inner surface of the dome is deeply coffered which has the effect of creating both vertical and horizontal ribs while lightening the overall load. At the summit is an ocular opening across which provides light to the interior.

Bramante&#x27;s plan for the dome of St. Peter&#x27;s (1506) follows that of the Pantheon very closely, and like that of the Pantheon, was designed to be constructed in Tufa Concrete for which he had rediscovered a formula. With the exception of the lantern that surmounts it, the profile is very similar, except that in this case, the supporting wall becomes a drum raised high above ground level on four massive piers. The solid wall, as used at the Pantheon, is lightened at St. Peter&#x27;s by Bramante piercing it with windows and encircling it with a peristyle.

In the case of Florence Cathedral, the desired visual appearance of the pointed dome existed for many years before Brunelleschi made its construction feasible. Its double-shell construction of bricks locked together in a herringbone pattern (re-introduced from Byzantine architecture), and the gentle upward slope of its eight stone ribs made it possible for the construction to take place without the massive wooden formwork necessary to construct hemispherical arches. While its appearance, with the exception of the details of the lantern, is entirely Gothic, its engineering was highly innovative, and the product of a mind that had studied the huge vaults and remaining dome of Ancient Rome.

Sangallo&#x27;s plan (1513), of which a large wooden model still exists, looks to both these predecessors. He realized the value of both the coffering at the Pantheon and the outer stone ribs at Florence Cathedral. He strengthened and extended the peristyle of Bramante into a series of arched and ordered openings around the base, with a second such arcade set back in a tier above the first. In his hands, the rather delicate form of the lantern, based closely on that in Florence, became a massive structure, surrounded by a projecting base, a peristyle and surmounted by a spire of conic form. According to James Lees-Milne the design was &quot;too eclectic, too pernickety and too tasteless to have been a success&quot;.

====Michelangelo and Giacomo della Porta, 1547 and 1585====

Michelangelo redesigned the dome in 1547, taking into account all that had gone before. His dome, like that of Florence, is constructed of two shells of brick, the outer one having 16 stone ribs, twice the number at Florence but far fewer than in Sangallo&#x27;s design. As with the designs of Bramante and Sangallo, the dome is raised from the piers on a drum. The encircling peristyle of Bramante and the arcade of Sangallo are reduced to 16 pairs of Corinthian columns, each of high which stand proud of the building, connected by an arch. Visually they appear to buttress each of the ribs, but structurally they are probably quite redundant. The reason for this is that the dome is ovoid in shape, rising steeply as does the dome of Florence Cathedral, and therefore exerting less outward thrust than does a hemispherical dome, such as that of the Pantheon, which, although it is not buttressed, is countered by the downward thrust of heavy masonry which extends above the circling wall.

The ovoid profile of the dome has been the subject of much speculation and scholarship over the past century. Michelangelo died in 1564, leaving the drum of the dome complete, and Bramante&#x27;s piers much bulkier than originally designed, each across. Following his death, the work continued under his assistant Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola with Giorgio Vasari appointed by Pope Pius V as a watchdog to make sure that Michelangelo&#x27;s plans were carried out exactly. Despite Vignola&#x27;s knowledge of Michelangelo&#x27;s intentions, little happened in this period. In 1585 the energetic Pope Sixtus V appointed Giacomo della Porta who was to be assisted by Domenico Fontana. The five-year reign of Sixtus was to see the building advance at a great rate.

Michelangelo left a few drawings, including an early drawing of the dome, and some details. There were also detailed engravings published in 1569 by Stefan du Pérac who claimed that they were the master&#x27;s final solution. Michelangelo, like Sangallo before him, also left a large wooden model. Giacomo della Porta subsequently altered this model in several ways. The major change restored an earlier design, in which the outer dome appears to rise above, rather than rest directly on the base. Most of the other changes were of a cosmetic nature, such as the adding of lion&#x27;s masks over the swags on the drum in honour of Pope Sixtus and adding a circlet of finials around the spire at the top of the lantern, as proposed by Sangallo.

A drawing by Michelangelo indicates that his early intentions were towards an ovoid dome, rather than a hemispherical one. In an engraving in Galasso Alghisi&#x27; treatise (1563), the dome may be represented as ovoid, but the perspective is ambiguous. Stefan du Pérac&#x27;s engraving (1569) shows a hemispherical dome, but this was perhaps an inaccuracy of the engraver. The profile of the wooden model is more ovoid than that of the engravings, but less so than the finished product. It has been suggested that Michelangelo on his death bed reverted to the more pointed shape. However, Lees-Milne cites Giacomo della Porta as taking full responsibility for the change and as indicating to Pope Sixtus that Michelangelo was lacking in the scientific understanding of which he himself was capable.

Helen Gardner suggests that Michelangelo made the change to the hemispherical dome of lower profile in order to establish a balance between the dynamic vertical elements of the encircling giant order of pilasters and a more static and reposeful dome. Gardner also comments, &quot;The sculpturing of architecture [by Michelangelo] ... here extends itself up from the ground through the attic stories and moves on into the drum and dome, the whole building being pulled together into a unity from base to summit.&quot;

It is this sense of the building being sculptured, unified and &quot;pulled together&quot; by the encircling band of the deep cornice that led Eneide Mignacca to conclude that the ovoid profile, seen now in the end product, was an essential part of Michelangelo&#x27;s first (and last) concept. The sculptor/architect has, figuratively speaking, taken all the previous designs in hand and compressed their contours as if the building were a lump of clay. The dome &quot;must&quot; appear to thrust upwards because of the apparent pressure created by flattening the building&#x27;s angles and restraining its projections. If this explanation is the correct one, then the profile of the dome is not merely a structural solution, as perceived by Giacomo della Porta; it is part of the integrated design solution that is about visual tension and compression. In one sense, Michelangelo&#x27;s dome may appear to look backward to the Gothic profile of Florence Cathedral and ignore the Classicism of the Renaissance, but on the other hand, perhaps more than any other building of the 16th century, it prefigures the architecture of the Baroque.

====Completion====
Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana brought the dome to completion in 1590, the last year of the reign of Sixtus V. His successor, Gregory XIV, saw Fontana complete the lantern and had an inscription to the honour of Sixtus V placed around its inner opening. The next pope, Clement VIII, had the cross raised into place, an event which took all day, and was accompanied by the ringing of the bells of all the city&#x27;s churches. In the arms of the cross are set two lead caskets, one containing a fragment of the True Cross and a relic of St. Andrew and the other containing medallions of the Holy Lamb.

In the mid-18th century, cracks appeared in the dome, so four iron chains were installed between the two shells to bind it, like the rings that keep a barrel from bursting. As many as ten chains have been installed at various times, the earliest possibly planned by Michelangelo himself as a precaution, as Brunelleschi did at Florence Cathedral.

Around the inside of the dome is written, in letters high:

Beneath the lantern is the inscription:

==== Discovery of Michelangelo draft ====

On 7 December 2007, a fragment of a red chalk drawing of a section of the dome of the basilica, almost certainly by the hand of Michelangelo, was discovered in the Vatican archives. The drawing shows a small precisely drafted section of the plan of the entablature above two of the radial columns of the cupola drum. Michelangelo is known to have destroyed thousands of his drawings before his death. The rare survival of this example is probably due to its fragmentary state and the fact that detailed mathematical calculations had been made over the top of the drawing.

===Addition of nave and facade===

On 18 February 1606, under Pope Paul V, the dismantling of the remaining parts of the Constantinian basilica began. The marble cross that had been set at the top of the pediment by Pope Sylvester and Constantine the Great was lowered to the ground. The timbers were salvaged for the roof of the Borghese Palace and two rare black marble columns, the largest of their kind, were carefully stored and later used in the narthex. The tombs of various popes were opened, treasures removed and plans made for re-interment in the new basilica. The Pope had appointed Carlo Maderno in 1602. He was a nephew of Domenico Fontana and had demonstrated himself as a dynamic architect. Maderno&#x27;s idea was to ring Michelangelo&#x27;s building with chapels, but the Pope was hesitant about deviating from the master&#x27;s plan, even though he had been dead for forty years. The &quot;Fabbrica&quot; or building committee, a group drawn from various nationalities and generally despised by the Curia who viewed the basilica as belonging to Rome rather than Christendom, were in a quandary as to how the building should proceed. One of the matters that influenced their thinking was the Counter-Reformation which increasingly associated a Greek Cross plan with paganism and saw the Latin Cross as truly symbolic of Christianity. The central plan also did not have a &quot;dominant orientation toward the east.&quot;

Another influence on the thinking of both the Fabbrica and the Curia was a certain guilt at the demolition of the ancient building. The ground on which it and its various associated chapels, vestries and sacristies had stood for so long was hallowed. The only solution was to build a nave that encompassed the whole space. In 1607 a committee of ten architects was called together, and a decision was made to extend Michelangelo&#x27;s building into a nave. Maderno&#x27;s plans for both the nave and the facade were accepted.

The building of the nave began on 7 May 1607, and proceeded at a great rate, with an army of 700 labourers being employed. The following year, the façade was begun, in December 1614 the final touches were added to the stucco decoration of the vault and early in 1615 the partition wall between the two sections was pulled down. All the rubble was carted away, and the nave was ready for use by Palm Sunday.

==== Maderno&#x27;s facade ====
The facade designed by Maderno, is wide and high and is built of travertine stone, with a giant order of Corinthian columns and a central pediment rising in front of a tall attic surmounted by thirteen statues: Christ flanked by eleven of the Apostles (except Saint Peter, whose statue is left of the stairs) and John the Baptist. The inscription below the cornice on the tall frieze reads:

(Paul V (Camillo Borghese), born in Rome but of a Sienese family, liked to emphasize his &quot;Romanness&quot;.)

The facade is often cited as the least satisfactory part of the design of St. Peter&#x27;s. The reasons for this, according to James Lees-Milne, are that it was not given enough consideration by the Pope and committee because of the desire to get the building completed quickly, coupled with the fact that Maderno was hesitant to deviate from the pattern set by Michelangelo at the other end of the building. Lees-Milne describes the problems of the façade as being too broad for its height, too cramped in its details and too heavy in the attic story. The breadth is caused by modifying the plan to have towers on either side. These towers were never executed above the line of the facade because it was discovered that the ground was not sufficiently stable to bear the weight. One effect of the facade and lengthened nave is to screen the view of the dome, so that the building, from the front, has no vertical feature, except from a distance. 

====Bernini&#x27;s Towers====
Pope Urban had long been a critic of Bernini&#x27;s predecessor, Carlo Maderno. His disapproval of the architect&#x27;s work stemmed largely from Maderno&#x27;s design for the longitudinal nave of St. Peters, which was widely condemned for obscuring Michelangelo&#x27;s dome. When the Pope gave the commission to Bernini he therefore requested that a new design for the facade&#x27;s bell towers to be submitted for consideration. Baldinucci describes Bernini&#x27;s tower as consisting of &quot;two orders of columns and pilasters, the first order being Corinthian&quot; and &quot;a third or attic story formed of pilasters and two columns on either side of the open archway in the center&quot;.

Pope Urban desired the towers to be completed by a very specific date: 29 June 1641, the feast day dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. To this end an order was issued which stated that &quot;all work should take a second seat to that of the campanile&quot;. The south tower was completed on time even in spite of these issues, but records show that in the wake of the unveiling the Pope was not content with what he saw and he ordered the top level of Bernini&#x27;s tower removed so that the structure could be made even grander. The tower continued to grow, and as the construction began to settle, the first cracks started to appear followed by Urban&#x27;s infamous public admonishment of his architect.

In 1642 all work on both towers came to a halt. Bernini had to pay the cost for the demolition; eventually the idea of completing the bell towers was abandoned.

====Narthex and portals====
Behind the façade of St. Peter&#x27;s stretches a long portico or &quot;narthex&quot; such as was occasionally found in Italian churches. This is the part of Maderno&#x27;s design with which he was most satisfied. Its long barrel vault is decorated with ornate stucco and gilt, and successfully illuminated by small windows between pendentives, while the ornate marble floor is beamed with light reflected in from the piazza. At each end of the narthex is a theatrical space framed by ionic columns and within each is set a statue, an equestrian statue of Charlemagne (18th century) by Cornacchini in the south end and &quot;The Vision of Constantine&quot; (1670) by Bernini in the north end.

Five portals, of which three are framed by huge salvaged antique columns, lead into the basilica. The central portal has a bronze door created by Antonio Averulino c. 1440 for the old basilica and somewhat enlarged to fit the new space.

====Maderno&#x27;s nave====
To the single bay of Michelangelo&#x27;s Greek Cross, Maderno added a further three bays. He made the dimensions slightly different from Michelangelo&#x27;s bay, thus defining where the two architectural works meet. Maderno also tilted the axis of the nave slightly. This was not by accident, as suggested by his critics. An ancient Egyptian obelisk had been erected in the square outside, but had not been quite aligned with Michelangelo&#x27;s building, so Maderno compensated, in order that it should, at least, align with the Basilica&#x27;s façade.

The nave has huge paired pilasters, in keeping with Michelangelo&#x27;s work. The size of the interior is so &quot;stupendously large&quot; that it is hard to get a sense of scale within the building. The four cherubs who flutter against the first piers of the nave, carrying between them two holy water basins, appear of quite normal cherubic size, until approached. Then it becomes apparent that each one is over 2 metres high and that real children cannot reach the basins unless they scramble up the marble draperies. The aisles each have two smaller chapels and a larger rectangular chapel, the Chapel of the Sacrament and the Choir Chapel. These are lavishly decorated with marble, stucco, gilt, sculpture and mosaic. Remarkably, all of the large altarpieces, with the exception of the Holy Trinity by Pietro da Cortona in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, have been reproduced in mosaic. Two precious paintings from the old basilica, Our Lady of Perpetual Help and Our Lady of the Column are still being used as altarpieces.

Maderno&#x27;s last work at St. Peter&#x27;s was to design a crypt-like space or &quot;Confessio&quot; under the dome, where the cardinals and other privileged persons could descend in order to be nearer to the burial place of the apostle. Its marble steps are remnants of the old basilica and around its balustrade are 95 bronze lamps.

===Influence on church architecture===
The design of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, and in particular its dome, has greatly influenced church architecture in Western Christendom. Within Rome, the huge domed church of Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle was designed by Giacomo della Porta before the completion of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica, and subsequently worked on by Carlo Maderno. This was followed by the domes of San Carlo ai Catinari, Sant&#x27;Agnese in Agone, and many others. Christopher Wren&#x27;s dome at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (London, England), the domes of Karlskirche (Vienna, Austria), St. Nicholas Church (Prague, Czech Republic), and the Pantheon (Paris, France) all pay homage to St Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

The 19th and early-20th-century architectural revivals brought about the building of a great number of churches that imitate elements of St Peter&#x27;s to a greater or lesser degree, including St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago, St. Josaphat&#x27;s Basilica in Milwaukee, Immaculate Heart of Mary in Pittsburgh and Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral in Montreal, which replicates many aspects of St Peter&#x27;s on a smaller scale. Postmodernism has seen free adaptations of St Peter&#x27;s in the Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń, and the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro.

==Bernini&#x27;s furnishings==
===Pope Urban VIII and Bernini===
As a young boy Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598–1680) visited St. Peter&#x27;s with the painter Annibale Carracci and stated his wish to build &quot;a mighty throne for the apostle&quot;. His wish came true. As a young man, in 1626, he received the patronage of Pope Urban VIII and worked on the embellishment of the Basilica for 50 years. Appointed as Maderno&#x27;s successor in 1629, he was to become regarded as the greatest architect and sculptor of the Baroque period. Bernini&#x27;s works at St. Peter&#x27;s include the baldachin (baldaquin, from Italian: &quot;baldacchino&quot;), the Chapel of the Sacrament, the plan for the niches and loggias in the piers of the dome and the chair of St. Peter.

====Baldacchino and niches====
Bernini&#x27;s first work at St. Peter&#x27;s was to design the baldacchino, a pavilion-like structure tall and claimed to be the largest piece of bronze in the world, which stands beneath the dome and above the altar. Its design is based on the &quot;ciborium&quot;, of which there are many in the churches of Rome, serving to create a sort of holy space above and around the table on which the Sacrament is laid for the Eucharist and emphasizing the significance of this ritual. These &quot;ciboria&quot; are generally of white marble, with inlaid coloured stone. Bernini&#x27;s concept was for something very different. He took his inspiration in part from the baldachin or canopy carried above the head of the pope in processions, and in part from eight ancient columns that had formed part of a screen in the old basilica. Their twisted barley-sugar shape had a special significance as they were modelled on those of the Temple of Jerusalem and donated by the Emperor Constantine. Based on these columns, Bernini created four huge columns of bronze, twisted and decorated with laurel leaves and bees, which were the emblem of Pope Urban.

The baldacchino is surmounted not with an architectural pediment, like most baldacchini, but with curved Baroque brackets supporting a draped canopy, like the brocade canopies carried in processions above precious iconic images. In this case, the draped canopy is of bronze, and all the details, including the olive leaves, bees, and the portrait heads of Urban&#x27;s niece in childbirth and her newborn son, are picked out in gold leaf. The baldacchino stands as a vast free-standing sculptural object, central to and framed by the largest space within the building. It is so large that the visual effect is to create a link between the enormous dome which appears to float above it, and the congregation at floor level of the basilica. It is penetrated visually from every direction, and is visually linked to the &quot;Cathedra Petri&quot; in the apse behind it and to the four piers containing large statues that are at each diagonal.

As part of the scheme for the central space of the church, Bernini had the huge piers, begun by Bramante and completed by Michelangelo, hollowed out into niches, and had staircases made inside them, leading to four balconies. There was much dismay from those who thought that the dome might fall, but it did not. On the balconies Bernini created showcases, framed by the eight ancient twisted columns, to display the four most precious relics of the basilica: the spear of Longinus, said to have pierced the side of Christ, the veil of Veronica, with the miraculous image of the face of Christ, a fragment of the True Cross discovered in Jerusalem by Constantine&#x27;s mother, Helena, and a relic of Saint Andrew, the brother of Saint Peter. In each of the niches that surround the central space of the basilica was placed a huge statue of the saint associated with the relic above. Only &quot;Saint Longinus&quot; is the work of Bernini. (See below)

====Cathedra Petri and Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament====
Bernini then turned his attention to another precious relic, the so-called &quot;Cathedra Petri&quot; or &quot;throne of St. Peter&quot; a chair which was often claimed to have been used by the apostle, but appears to date from the 12th century. As the chair itself was fast deteriorating and was no longer serviceable, Pope Alexander VII determined to enshrine it in suitable splendor as the object upon which the line of successors to Peter was based. Bernini created a large bronze throne in which it was housed, raised high on four looping supports held effortlessly by massive bronze statues of four Doctors of the Church, Saints Ambrose and Augustine representing the Latin Church and Athanasius and John Chrysostom, the Greek Church. The four figures are dynamic with sweeping robes and expressions of adoration and ecstasy. Behind and above the cathedra, a blaze of light comes in through a window of yellow alabaster, illuminating, at its centre, the Dove of the Holy Spirit. The elderly painter, Andrea Sacchi, had urged Bernini to make the figures large, so that they would be seen well from the central portal of the nave. The chair was enshrined in its new home with great celebration of 16 January 1666.

Bernini&#x27;s final work for St. Peter&#x27;s, undertaken in 1676, was the decoration of the Chapel of the Sacrament. To hold the sacramental Host, he designed a miniature version in gilt bronze of Bramante&#x27;s Tempietto, the little chapel that marks the place of the death of St. Peter. On either side is an angel, one gazing in rapt adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome. Bernini died in 1680 in his 82nd year.
==St. Peter&#x27;s Piazza==


To the east of the basilica is the &quot;Piazza di San Pietro&quot;, (St. Peter&#x27;s Square). The present arrangement, constructed between 1656 and 1667, is the Baroque inspiration of Bernini who inherited a location already occupied by an Egyptian obelisk which was centrally placed, (with some contrivance) to Maderno&#x27;s facade. The obelisk, known as &quot;The Witness&quot;, at and a total height, including base and the cross on top, of , is the second largest standing obelisk, and the only one to remain standing since its removal from Egypt and re-erection at the Circus of Nero in 37 AD, where it is thought to have stood witness to the crucifixion of Saint Peter. Its removal to its present location by order of Pope Sixtus V and engineered by Domenico Fontana on 28 September 1586, was an operation fraught with difficulties and nearly ending in disaster when the ropes holding the obelisk began to smoke from the friction. Fortunately this problem was noticed by Benedetto Bresca, a sailor of Sanremo, and for his swift intervention, his town was granted the privilege of providing the palms that are used at the basilica each Palm Sunday.
The other object in the old square with which Bernini had to contend was a large fountain designed by Maderno in 1613 and set to one side of the obelisk, making a line parallel with the facade. Bernini&#x27;s plan uses this horizontal axis as a major feature of his unique, spatially dynamic and highly symbolic design. The most obvious solutions were either a rectangular piazza of vast proportions so that the obelisk stood centrally and the fountain (and a matching companion) could be included, or a trapezoid piazza which fanned out from the facade of the basilica like that in front of the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena. The problems of the square plan are that the necessary width to include the fountain would entail the demolition of numerous buildings, including some of the Vatican, and would minimize the effect of the facade. The trapezoid plan, on the other hand, would maximize the apparent width of the facade, which was already perceived as a fault of the design.
Bernini&#x27;s ingenious solution was to create a piazza in two sections. That part which is nearest the basilica is trapezoid, but rather than fanning out from the facade, it narrows. This gives the effect of countering the visual perspective. It means that from the second part of the piazza, the building looks nearer than it is, the breadth of the facade is minimized and its height appears greater in proportion to its width. The second section of the piazza is a huge elliptical circus which gently slopes downwards to the obelisk at its centre. The two distinct areas are framed by a colonnade formed by doubled pairs of columns supporting an entablature of the simple Tuscan Order.

The part of the colonnade that is around the ellipse does not entirely encircle it, but reaches out in two arcs, symbolic of the arms of &quot;the Catholic Church reaching out to welcome its communicants&quot;. The obelisk and Maderno&#x27;s fountain mark the widest axis of the ellipse. Bernini balanced the scheme with another fountain in 1675. The approach to the square used to be through a jumble of old buildings, which added an element of surprise to the vista that opened up upon passing through the colonnade. Nowadays a long wide street, the Via della Conciliazione, built by Mussolini after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaties, leads from the River Tiber to the piazza and gives distant views of St. Peter&#x27;s as the visitor approaches, with the basilica acting as a terminating vista.

Bernini&#x27;s transformation of the site is entirely Baroque in concept. Where Bramante and Michelangelo conceived a building that stood in &quot;self-sufficient isolation&quot;, Bernini made the whole complex &quot;expansively relate to its environment&quot;. Banister Fletcher says &quot;No other city has afforded such a wide-swept approach to its cathedral church, no other architect could have conceived a design of greater nobility ... (it is) the greatest of all atriums before the greatest of all churches of Christendom.&quot;
==Clocks==
The top of the facade of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica has two clocks and several sculptures. The clocks were created to replace Bernini&#x27;s bell towers which had to be torn down due to insufficient support. The left hand clock shows Rome time, the right hand one shows European mean time. The statues are Christ the Redeemer, St. John the Baptist and 11 Apostles. From the left: St. Thadeus, St. Matthew, St. Philip, St. Thomas, St. James the Greater, St. John the Baptist, The Redeemer, St. Andrew, St. John the Evangelist, St. James the Lesser, St. Bartholomew, St. Simeon, and St. Matthias. Above the Roman clock is the coat of arms for the city-state of Vatican City since 1931 held by two angels.

==Bells==
The Basilica has 6 bells, placed in the room under the Roman clock, only 3 of them are visible from ground level while the rest are hidden behind the bourdon. They range from the smallest which is 260 kg to the massive bourdon that approximately weighs 9 tonnes. From 1931, the bells are operated electrically, thus permitting even the largest bell to be tolled from a distance. The oldest bell Rota dates from 1288 and the bourdon called Campanone is rung at Christmas and Easter, on the Solemnity of Sts. Peter and Paul, and every time the Pope imparts the &quot;Urbi et Orbi&quot; blessing to the city and to the world. Campanone also announces the death of the pope and an election of a new pope.
==Treasures==
===Tombs and relics===
There are over 100 tombs within St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica (extant to various extents), many located beneath the Basilica. These include 91 popes, Saint Ignatius of Antioch, Holy Roman Emperor Otto II, and the composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. Exiled Catholic British royalty James Francis Edward Stuart and his two sons, Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Benedict Stuart, Cardinal Bishop of Frascati, are buried here, having been granted asylum by Pope Clement XI. Also buried here are Maria Clementina Sobieska, wife of James Francis Edward Stuart, Queen Christina of Sweden, who abdicated her throne in order to convert to Catholicism, and Countess Matilda of Tuscany, supporter of the Papacy during the Investiture Controversy. The most recent interment was Pope Benedict XVI, on 5 January 2023. Beneath, near the crypt, is the recently discovered vaulted fourth-century &quot;Tomb of the Julii&quot;. (See below for some descriptions of tombs).

===Artworks===
====Towers and narthex====
* In the towers to either side of the facade are two clocks. The clock on the left has been operated electrically since 1931. Its oldest bell dates from 1288.
* One of the most important treasures of the basilica is a mosaic set above the central external door. Called the &quot;Navicella&quot;, it is based on a design by Giotto (early 14th century) and represents a ship symbolizing the Christian Church. The mosaic is mostly a 17th-century copy of Giotto&#x27;s original.
* At each end of the narthex is an equestrian figure, to the north Constantine the Great by Bernini (1670) and to the south Charlemagne by Cornacchini (18th century).
* Of the five portals from the narthex to the interior, three contain notable doors. The central portal has the Renaissance bronze door by Antonio Averulino (called Filarete) (1455), enlarged to fit the new space. The southern door, the &quot;Door of the Dead&quot;, was designed by 20th-century sculptor Giacomo Manzù and includes a portrait of Pope John XXIII kneeling before the crucified figure of Saint Peter.
* The northernmost door is the &quot;Holy Door&quot; which, by tradition, is walled-up with bricks, and opened only for holy years such as the Jubilee year by the Pope. The present door is bronze and was designed by Vico Consorti in 1950 and cast in Florence by the Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry. Above it are inscriptions commemorating the opening of the door: PAVLVS V PONT MAX ANNO XIII and GREGORIVS XIII PONT MAX.

Recently installed commemorative plaques read above the door as follows:

Older commemorative plaques are removed to make way for the new plaque when the holy door is opened and sealed.

====Nave====
* On the first piers of the nave are two Holy Water basins held by pairs of cherubs each 2 metres high, commissioned by Pope Benedict XIII from designer Agostino Cornacchini and sculptor Francesco Moderati, (1720s).
* Along the floor of the nave are markers showing the comparative lengths of other churches, starting from the entrance.
* On the decorative pilasters of the piers of the nave are medallions with relief depicting 56 of the first popes.
* In niches between the pilasters of the nave are statues depicting 39 founders of religious orders.
* Set against the north east pier of the dome is a statue of &quot;Saint Peter Enthroned&quot;, sometimes attributed to late 13th-century sculptor Arnolfo di Cambio, with some scholars dating it to the fifth century. One foot of the statue is largely worn away by pilgrims kissing it for centuries.
* The sunken Confessio leading to the Vatican Grottoes (see above) contained a large kneeling statue by Canova of Pope Pius VI, who was captured and mistreated by Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s army. This has now been moved to the back (eastern) end of the grottoes.
* In the Confessio is the &quot;Niche of the Pallium&quot; (&quot;Niche of Stoles&quot;) which contains a bronze urn, donated by Pope Benedict XIV, to contain white stoles embroidered with black crosses and woven with the wool of lambs blessed on the feastday of St. Agnes.
* The High Altar is surmounted by Bernini&#x27;s baldachin. (See above)
* Set in niches within the four piers supporting the dome are the larger-than-life statues associated with the basilica&#x27;s primary holy relics: Saint Helena holding the True Cross and the Holy Nails, by Andrea Bolgi; Saint Longinus holding the spear that pierced the side of Jesus, by Bernini (1639); Saint Andrew with the St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross, by Francois Duquesnoy and Saint Veronica holding her veil with the image of Jesus&#x27; face, by Francesco Mochi.

====North aisle====
* In the first chapel of the north aisle is Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Pietà&quot;.
* On the first pier in the right aisle is the monument of Queen Christina of Sweden, who abdicated in 1654 in order to convert to Catholicism.
* The second chapel, dedicated to Saint Sebastian, contains the statues of popes Pius XI and Pius XII. The space below the altar used to be the resting place of Pope Innocent XI but his remains were moved to the &quot;Altar of the Transfiguration&quot; on 8 April 2011. This was done to make way for the body of Pope John Paul II. His remains were placed beneath the altar on 2 May 2011.
* The large chapel on the right aisle is the &quot;Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament&quot; which contains the tabernacle by Bernini (1664) resembling Bramante&#x27;s &quot;Tempietto&quot; at San Pietro in Montorio supported by two kneeling angels and with behind it a painting of the Holy Trinity by Pietro da Cortona.
* Near the altar of &quot;Our Lady of Succour&quot; are the monuments of popes Gregory XIII by Camillo Rusconi (1723) and Gregory XIV.
* At the end of the aisle is an altar containing the relics of Saint Petronilla and with an altarpiece &quot;The Burial of St Petronilla&quot; by Guercino (Giovanni Francesco Barbieri), 1623.

====South aisle====
* The first chapel in the south aisle is the baptistry, commissioned by Pope Innocent XII and designed by Carlo Fontana, (great nephew of Domenico Fontana). The font was carved from the lid of the purple porphyry sarcophagus which had once held the remains of the Emperor Hadrian, and is surmounted with a gilt-bronze figure of the &quot;Lamb of God&quot;. Fontana&#x27;s reworked porphyry sarcophagus lid font replaced an earlier font, which was re-purposed from the sarcophagus of Probus, the fourth-century Prefect of Rome, and which was used for baptisms from the 15th century until the late 17th century, when Fontana&#x27;s work was completed.
* Against the first pier of the aisle is the Monument to the Royal Stuarts: James Stuart, known as the &quot;Old Pretender&quot; and his sons, Charles Edward, known as &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;, and Henry, a cardinal. The tomb is a Neo-Classical design by Canova unveiled in 1819. Opposite it is the memorial of James Francis Edward Stuart&#x27;s wife, Maria Clementina Sobieska.
* The second chapel is that of the &quot;Presentation of the Virgin&quot; and contains the memorials of Pope Benedict XV and Pope John XXIII.
* Against the piers are the tombs of Pope Pius X and Pope Innocent VIII.
* The large chapel off the south aisle is the &quot;Choir Chapel&quot; which contains the altar of the &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot;.
* At the entrance to the Sacristy is the tomb of Pope Pius VIII
* The south transept contains the altars of Saint Thomas, Saint Joseph and the &quot;Crucifixion of Saint Peter&quot;.
* The tomb of Fabio Chigi, Pope Alexander VII, towards the end of the aisle, is the work of Bernini and called by Lees-Milne &quot;one of the greatest tombs of the Baroque Age&quot;. It occupies an awkward position, being set in a niche above a doorway into a small vestry, but Bernini has utilized the doorway in a symbolic manner. Pope Alexander kneels upon his tomb, facing outward. The tomb is supported on a large draped shroud in patterned red marble, and is supported by four female figures, of whom only the two at the front are fully visible. They represent Charity and Truth. The foot of Truth rests upon a globe of the world, her toe being pierced symbolically by the thorn of Protestant England. Coming forth, seemingly, from the doorway as if it were the entrance to a tomb, is the skeletal winged figure of Death, its head hidden beneath the shroud, but its right hand carrying an hourglass stretched upward towards the kneeling figure of the pope.

<text>The Last Supper ( or ) is a mural painting by the Italian High Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, dated to , housed in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. The painting represents the scene of the Last Supper of Jesus with the Twelve Apostles, as it is told in the Gospel of Johnspecifically the moment after Jesus announces that one of his apostles will betray him. Its handling of space, mastery of perspective, treatment of motion and complex display of human emotion has made it one of the Western world&#x27;s most recognizable paintings and among Leonardo&#x27;s most celebrated works. Some commentators consider it pivotal in inaugurating the transition into what is now termed the High Renaissance.

The work was commissioned as part of a plan of renovations to the church and its convent buildings by Leonardo&#x27;s patron Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. In order to permit his inconsistent painting schedule and frequent revisions, it is painted with materials that allowed for regular alterations: tempera on gesso, pitch, and mastic. Due to the methods used, a variety of environmental factors, and intentional damage, little of the original painting remains today despite numerous restoration attempts, the last being completed in 1999. &quot;The Last Supper&quot; is Leonardo&#x27;s largest work, aside from the &quot;Sala delle Asse&quot;.

== Painting ==
=== Commission and creation ===
&quot;The Last Supper&quot; measures and covers an end wall of the dining hall at the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. The theme was a traditional one for refectories, although the room was not a refectory at the time that Leonardo painted it. The main church building was still under construction while Leonardo was composing the painting. Leonardo&#x27;s patron, Ludovico Sforza, planned that the church should be remodeled as a family mausoleum. To this end, changes were made, perhaps to plans by Donato Bramante. These plans were not fully carried out, and a smaller mortuary chapel was constructed, adjacent to the cloister. The painting was commissioned by Sforza to decorate the wall of the mausoleum. The lunettes above the main painting, formed by the triple arched ceiling of the refectory, are painted with Sforza coats-of-arms. The opposite wall of the refectory is covered by the &quot;Crucifixion&quot; fresco by Giovanni Donato da Montorfano, to which Leonardo added figures of the Sforza family in tempera; these figures have deteriorated in much the same way as has &quot;The Last Supper&quot;.

Leonardo worked on &quot;The Last Supper&quot; from about 1495 to 1498, but he did not work continuously. The beginning date is not certain, as the archives of the convent for the period have been destroyed. A document dated 1497 indicates that the painting was nearly completed at that date. A prior from the monastery reportedly complained to Leonardo about its delay. Leonardo wrote to the head of the monastery, explaining he had been struggling to find the perfect villainous face for Judas, and that if he could not find a face corresponding with what he had in mind, he would use the features of the prior who had complained.

In 1557, Gian Paolo Lomazzo wrote that Leonardo&#x27;s friend Bernardo Zenale advised him to leave Christ&#x27;s face unfinished, arguing that &quot;it would be impossible to imagine faces lovelier or gentler than those of James the Greater or James the Less.&quot; Leonardo apparently took the advice.

=== Medium ===
Leonardo, as a painter, favoured oil painting, a medium which allows the artist to work slowly and make changes with ease. Fresco painting does not facilitate either of these objectives. Leonardo also sought a greater luminosity and intensity of light and shade (chiaroscuro) than could be achieved with fresco, in which the water-soluble colours are painted onto wet plaster, laid freshly each day in sections. Rather than using the proven method of painting on walls, Leonardo painted &quot;The Last Supper&quot; in tempera, the medium generally used for panel painting. The painting is on a stone wall sealed with a double layer of gesso, pitch, and mastic. Then he added an undercoat of white lead to enhance the brightness of the tempera that was applied on top. This was a method that had been described previously by Cennino Cennini in the 14th century. However, Cennini described the technique as being more risky than fresco painting, and recommended the use of painting in a more superficial medium for the final touches only.

=== Subject ===
&quot;The Last Supper&quot; portrays the reaction given by each apostle when Jesus said one of them would betray him. All twelve apostles have different reactions to the news, with various degrees of anger and shock. The apostles were identified by their names, using an unsigned, mid-sixteenth-century fresco copy of Leonardo&#x27;s Cenacolo. Before this, only Judas, Peter, John and Jesus had been positively identified. From left to right, according to the apostles&#x27; heads:
* Bartholomew, James, son of Alphaeus, and Andrew form a group of three; all are surprised.
* Judas Iscariot, Peter, and John form another group of three. Judas is wearing red, blue, and green and is in shadow, looking withdrawn and taken aback by the sudden revelation of his plan. He is clutching a small bag, perhaps signifying the silver given to him as payment to betray Jesus, or perhaps a reference to his role as a treasurer. He is also tipping over the salt cellar, which may be related to the near-Eastern expression to &quot;betray the salt&quot; meaning to betray one&#x27;s master. He is the only person to have his elbow on the table and his head is also vertically the lowest of anyone in the painting. Peter wears an expression of anger and appears to be holding a knife, foreshadowing his violent reaction in Gethsemane during the arrest of Jesus. Peter is leaning towards John and touching him on the shoulder, in reference to John&#x27;s Gospel where he signals the &quot;beloved disciple&quot; to ask Jesus who is to betray him. The youngest apostle, John, appears to swoon and lean towards Peter.
* Jesus
* Thomas, James the Greater, and Philip are the next group of three. Thomas is clearly upset; the raised index finger foreshadows his incredulity of the Resurrection. James the Greater looks stunned, with his arms in the air. Meanwhile, Philip appears to be requesting some explanation.
* Matthew, Jude Thaddeus, and Simon the Zealot are the final group of three. Both Thaddeus and Matthew are turned toward Simon, perhaps to find out if he has any answer to their initial questions.

In common with other depictions of the Last Supper from this period, Leonardo seats the diners on one side of the table, so that none of them has his back to the viewer. The tablecloth is white with blue stripes, which are colours commonly associated with the Jewish people. This is the painting&#x27;s only overt reference to the ethnicity of Jesus and his disciples. Most previous depictions excluded Judas by placing him alone on the opposite side of the table from the other eleven disciples and Jesus, or placing halos around all the disciples except Judas.
Leonardo instead has Judas lean back into shadow. Jesus is predicting that his betrayer will take the bread at the same time he does to Thomas and James the Greater to his left, who react in horror as Jesus points with his left hand to a piece of bread before them. Distracted by the conversation between John and Peter, Judas reaches for a different piece of bread not noticing Jesus too stretching out with his right hand towards it (Matthew 26: 23). The angles and lighting draw attention to Jesus, whose turned right cheek is located at the vanishing point for all perspective lines. In addition, the painting demonstrated Leonardo&#x27;s masterful use of perspective as it &quot;draws our attention to the face of Christ at the center of the composition, and Christ&#x27;s face, through his down-turned gaze, directs our focus along the diagonal of his left arm to his hand and therefore, the bread.&quot;

Leonardo reportedly used the likenesses of people in and around Milan as inspiration for the painting&#x27;s figures. The convent&#x27;s prior complained to Sforza of Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;laziness&quot; as he wandered the streets to find a criminal to base Judas on. Leonardo responded that if he could find no one else, the prior would make a suitable model.
While the painting was being executed, Leonardo&#x27;s friend, the mathematician Luca Pacioli, called it &quot;a symbol of man&#x27;s burning desire for salvation&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early copies ===
Two early copies of &quot;The Last Supper&quot; are known to exist, presumed to be work by Leonardo&#x27;s assistants. The copies are almost the size of the original, and have survived with a wealth of original detail still intact. One, by Giampietrino, is in the collection of the Royal Academy of Arts, London, and the other, by Cesare da Sesto, is installed at the Church of St. Ambrogio in Ponte Capriasca, Switzerland. A third copy (oil on canvas) is painted by Andrea Solari (c. 1520) and is on display in the Leonardo da Vinci Museum of the Tongerlo Abbey, Belgium.

=== Damage and restorations ===

Because Sforza had ordered the church to be rebuilt hastily, the masons filled the walls with moisture-retaining rubble. The painting was done on a thin exterior wall, so the effects of humidity were felt keenly, and the paint failed to properly adhere to it. Because of the method used, soon after the painting was completed on 9 February 1498 it began to deteriorate. In 1499, Louis XII contemplated removing the painting from the wall and taking it to France. As early as 1517, the painting was starting to flake, and in 1532 Gerolamo Cardano described it as &quot;blurred and colorless compared with what I remember of it when I saw it as a boy&quot;. By 1556 – fewer than sixty years after it was finished – Giorgio Vasari described the painting as reduced to a &quot;muddle of blots&quot; so deteriorated that the figures were unrecognizable. By the second half of the 16th century, Gian Paolo Lomazzo stated that &quot;the painting is all ruined&quot;. In 1652, a doorway was cut through the (then unrecognisable) painting, and later bricked up; this can still be seen as the irregular arch-shaped structure near the center base of the painting. It is believed, through early copies, that Jesus&#x27; feet were in a position symbolizing the forthcoming crucifixion. In 1768, a curtain was hung over the painting intended for its protection; the curtain instead trapped moisture on the surface, and whenever it was pulled back, it scratched the flaking paint.

A first restoration was attempted in 1726 by Michelangelo Bellotti, who filled in missing sections with oil paint then varnished the whole mural. This repair did not last well and another restoration was attempted in 1770 by an otherwise unknown artist named Giuseppe Mazza. Mazza stripped off Bellotti&#x27;s work then largely repainted the painting; he had redone all but three faces when he was halted due to public outrage. In 1796, French revolutionary anti-clerical troops used the refectory as an armory and stable; they threw stones at the painting and climbed ladders to scratch out the Apostles&#x27; eyes. Goethe wrote that in 1800, the room was flooded with two feet of water after a heavy rainstorm. The refectory was used as a prison; it is not known if any of the prisoners may have damaged the painting. In 1821, Stefano Barezzi, an expert in removing whole frescoes from their walls intact, was called in to remove the painting to a safer location; he badly damaged the center section before realizing that Leonardo&#x27;s work was not a fresco. Barezzi then attempted to reattach damaged sections with glue. From 1901 to 1908, Luigi Cavenaghi first completed a careful study of the structure of the painting, then began cleaning it. In 1924, Oreste Silvestri did further cleaning, and stabilised some parts with stucco.

During World War II, on 15 August 1943, the refectory was struck by Allied bombing; protective sandbagging prevented the painting from being struck by bomb splinters, but it may have been damaged by the vibration. Between 1946 and 1954, Mauro Pellicioli undertook a clean-and-stabilise restoration, which Brera director was involved in. Pellicioli reattached paint to the wall using a clear shellac, making it relatively darker and more colorful, and removed some of the overpainting. However, as of 1972, the repainting done in various restorations had made the heads of saints Peter, Andrew, and James differ significantly from the original design.

==== Major restoration ====
The painting&#x27;s appearance by the late 1970s had badly deteriorated. From 1978 to 1999, Pinin Brambilla Barcilon guided a major restoration project to stabilize the painting and reverse the damage caused by dirt and pollution. The eighteenth- and nineteenth-century restoration attempts were also reversed. Since it had proved impractical to move the painting to a more controlled environment, the refectory was instead converted to a sealed, climate-controlled environment, which meant bricking up the windows. Then, detailed study was undertaken to determine the painting&#x27;s original form, using scientific tests (especially infrared reflectoscopy and microscopic core-samples), and original cartoons preserved in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle. Some areas were deemed unrestorable. These were using watercolor in subdued colors intended to indicate they were not original work, while not being too distracting.

This restoration took 21 years and, on 28 May 1999, the painting was returned to display. Intending visitors were required to book ahead and could only stay for 15 minutes. When it was unveiled, considerable controversy was aroused by the dramatic changes in colors, tones, and even some facial shapes. James Beck, professor of art history at Columbia University and founder of ArtWatch International, had been a particularly strong critic. Michael Daley, director of ArtWatch UK, has also complained about the restored version of the painting. He has been critical of Christ&#x27;s right arm in the image which has been altered from a draped sleeve to what Daley calls &quot;muff-like drapery&quot;.

== In culture ==
&quot;The Last Supper&quot; has frequently been referenced, reproduced, or parodied in Western culture. Some of the more notable examples are:

=== Non-modern painting, mosaic, and photography ===

A 16th-century oil on canvas copy is conserved in the abbey of Tongerlo, Antwerp, Belgium. It reveals many details that are no longer visible on the original. The Roman mosaic artist Giacomo Raffaelli made another life-sized copy (1809–1814), commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte, that resides in the Minoritenkirche in Vienna.

=== Modern art ===
In 1955, Salvador Dalí painted &quot;The Sacrament of the Last Supper&quot;, with Jesus portrayed as blond and clean shaven, pointing upward to a spectral torso while the apostles are gathered around the table heads bowed so that none may be identified. It is reputed to be one of the most viewed paintings in the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

Mary Beth Edelson&#x27;s &quot;Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper&quot; (1972) appropriated &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, with the heads of notable women artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles. The artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles in &quot;Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper&quot; include Lynda Benglis, Louise Bourgeois, Elaine de Kooning, Helen Frankenthaler, Nancy Graves, Lila Katzen, Lee Krasner, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Louise Nevelson, Yoko Ono, M. C. Richards, Alma Thomas, and June Wayne. As well, other women artists have their image shown in the border of the piece; in all eighty-two women artists are part of the whole image. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became &quot;one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement&quot;.

Sculptor Marisol Escobar rendered &quot;The Last Supper&quot; as a life-sized, three-dimensional, sculptural assemblage using painted and drawn wood, plywood, brownstone, plaster, and aluminum. This work, &quot;Self-Portrait Looking at The Last Supper&quot; (1982–1984), is in New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Art dealer Alexander Iolas commissioned Andy Warhol to produce a series of paintings based on &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, first exhibited in Milan in January 1987. The series would be the artist&#x27;s last before his death.

=== Literature ===
In her 1834 ekphrasic poem, &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, Lydia Sigourney focuses on Christ&#x27;s betrayer, repeatedly asks &quot;Is it I?&quot; and closes with the prayer that our feet be so guided:

Author Mary Shelley describes her impression of the painting in her travel narrative, &quot;Rambles in Germany and Italy&quot;, published 1844:

=== Film and television ===
The painting is closely resembled in the film &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, where Peter preaches in front of a large Christian crowd. As he tells the story of the Last Supper, the film shifts into a brief scene where the background, clothing, and positions of Jesus and the 12 Disciples is alike to the painting itself. In Luis Buñuel&#x27;s 1961 Spanish film &quot;Viridiana&quot;, a &quot;tableau vivant&quot; of Leonardo&#x27;s painting is staged with beggars. Another beggar &quot;photographs&quot; the scene by flashing them. This scene contributed to its refusal by the Vatican who called it &quot;blasphemous&quot;. The painting is parodied in the motion picture of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970), in the scene where Hawkeye Pierce stages a &quot;last supper&quot; for Walt (Painless) Waldowski before his planned suicide. The various doctors, all in surgical scrubs, pose in imitation of the painting. In Norman Jewison&#x27;s film version of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1973), in the Last Supper sequence, Jesus and the 12 apostles briefly mimic the posture of each character in Leonardo&#x27;s painting. The painting is also parodied in Mel Brooks&#x27;s movie &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (1981), making Leonardo a contemporary of Jesus.

Many parodies of the painting appear on the small screen, including &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;″s 1998 first-season episode &quot;Streaking&quot;, with Eric flanked by his friends (and Jackie wondering why everyone is sitting on the same side of the table); The season seven finale of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Requiem&quot; (and Mulder&#x27;s last episode as a series regular) features a scene in Skinner&#x27;s office with the characters lined up in homage to the painting; &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ 2005 Season 16 episode &quot;Thank God, It&#x27;s Doomsday&quot;, with Homer as Jesus and Moe and his other patrons as the disciples; and &quot;South Park&quot;″s 2009 Season 13 episode &quot;Margaritaville&quot;, with Kyle and his friends eating at a pizza parlor. In one 2015 episode of the CBC drama &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; called &quot;Barenaked Ladies&quot;, the suspects recreate the poses of Peter, Judas, and Thomas in their victims.

The fifth episode of the 2021 TV series &quot;Leonardo&quot; depicts a fictional story of how the painting was created.

=== 2024 Summer Olympics ===
At the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, a segment that some have claimed was called (&quot;The Last Supper on the stage on the Seine&quot;) involving drag queens that was variously claimed to parody &quot;The Last Supper&quot; or a feast with Dionysus was widely criticised by some Christian conservatives and religious leaders, who alleged that it was mocking Christianity. This claim was later debunked when the Olympic World Library published the media guide (written before the ceremony) which mentioned it being a homage to cultural festivities as the segment is actually called (&quot;Festivity/Celebration&quot;). According to Georgian fact checking website &quot;Myth Detector&quot;, many experts had pointed out the differences between the fresco and the segment.

== Other speculation ==
&quot;The Last Supper&quot; has been the target of much speculation by writers and historical revisionists alike, usually centered on purported hidden messages or hints found within the painting, especially since the publication of Dan Brown&#x27;s novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2003), in which one of the characters suggests that the person to Jesus&#x27; right (left of Jesus from the viewer&#x27;s perspective) is actually Mary Magdalene. It also states that there was a letter &#x27;glaring in the center of the painting&#x27; (M) standing for Matrimonio or Mary Magdalene. This speculation originated in earlier books &quot;The Templar Revelation&quot; (1997) by Lynn Picknett and &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot; by Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln and Richard Leigh (1982). Art historians hold that the figure is the Apostle John, who appears androgynous in line with Leonardo&#x27;s characteristic fascination with blurring the lines between the sexes, a quality which is found in his other paintings, such as &quot;St. John the Baptist&quot; (painted 1513–1516). Christopher L. Hodapp and Alice Von Kannon comment, &quot;If he [John] looks effeminate and needs a haircut, so does James, the second figure on the left.&quot; According to Ross King, an expert on Italian art, Mary Magdalene&#x27;s appearance at the last supper would not have been controversial and Leonardo would have had no motive to disguise her as one of the other disciples, since she was widely venerated in her role as the &quot;Apostle to the Apostles&quot; and was the patron of the Dominican Order, for whom &quot;The Last Supper&quot; was painted. There would have even been precedent for it, since the earlier Italian Renaissance painter Fra Angelico had included her in his painting of the Last Supper.

The painting contains several possible numerical references, including to the number three. The Apostles are seated in groups of three, there are three windows behind Jesus, and the shape of Jesus&#x27; figure resembles a triangle. His hands are located at the golden ratio of half the height of the composition. The painting can also be interpreted using the Fibonacci series: one table, one central figure, two side walls, three windows and figures grouped in threes, five groups of figures, eight panels on the walls and eight table legs, and thirteen individual figures. Debates among art historians still surround the use of the Fibonacci series as some argue that its purposeful use did not fully begin to be applied to architecture until the early 19th century.

<text>The Codex Seraphinianus, originally published in 1981, is an illustrated encyclopedia of an imaginary world, created by Italian artist, architect and industrial designer Luigi Serafini between 1976 and 1978. It has approximately 360 pages (depending on edition) and is written in an imaginary language.

Originally published in Italy, it has been released in several countries.

==Description==

The &quot;Codex&quot; is an encyclopedia in manuscript with copious hand-drawn, colored-pencil illustrations of bizarre and fantastical flora, fauna, anatomies, fashions, and foods. It has been compared to the still undeciphered Voynich manuscript, the story &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; by Jorge Luis Borges, and the artwork of M. C. Escher and Hieronymus Bosch.

The illustrations are often surreal parodies of things in the real world, such as a bleeding fruit, a plant that grows into roughly the shape of a chair and is subsequently made into one, and a copulating couple who metamorphose into an alligator. Others depict odd, apparently senseless machines, often with delicate appearances and bound by tiny filaments. Some illustrations are recognizable as maps or human faces, while others (especially in the &quot;physics&quot; chapter) are mostly or totally abstract. Nearly all of the illustrations are brightly coloured and highly detailed.

==Writing system==

The false writing system appears modeled on Western writing systems, with left-to-right writing in rows and an alphabet with uppercase and lowercase letters, some of which double as numerals. Some letters appear only at the beginning or end of words, similar to Semitic writing systems. The curvilinear letters are rope- or thread-like, with loops and even knots, and are somewhat reminiscent of Sinhala script.

In a talk at the Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles on 11 May 2009, Serafini stated that there is no meaning behind the &quot;Codex&quot;&#x27;s script, which is asemic; that his experience in writing it was similar to automatic writing; and that what he wanted his alphabet to convey was the sensation children feel with books they cannot yet understand, although they see that the writing makes sense for adults. However, the book&#x27;s page-numbering system was decoded by Allan C. Wechsler and Bulgarian linguist Ivan Derzhanski, as being a variation of base 21.

==Contents==

The book is in eleven chapters, in two sections. The first section appears to describe the natural world of flora, fauna and physics. The second deals with various aspects of human life, including garments, history, cuisine and architecture. Each chapter seems to address a general encyclopedic topic, as follows:

# Types of flora: strange flowers, trees that uproot themselves and migrate, etc.
# Fauna (animals), including surreal variations of the horse, hippopotamus, rhinoceros and birds
# An apparently separate kingdom of odd bipedal creatures
# Physics and chemistry (generally considered the most abstract, enigmatic chapter)
# Bizarre machines and vehicles
# The humanities: biology, sexuality, aboriginal peoples, including some examples with plant life and tools (e.g. pens, wrenches) grafted onto the human body
# History: people (some only vaguely human) of unknown significance, with their times of birth and death; scenes of historical and possibly religious significance; burial and funeral customs
# The Codex&#x27;s writing system (which is to say, the – or probably, a – writing system of the world (if a world it is) from which the codex originates, or which it documents), including punctuation marks, the text being written, and experiments performed upon the text
# Food, dining practices, garments
# Bizarre games, including cards, board games and athletic sports
# Architecture

After the last chapter is a table of contents or index, followed by an apparent afterword whose writing is more casually rendered.

Two plates in the sixth chapter contain lines of French text, a quote from Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu: Albertine disparue&quot; (&quot;In Search of Lost Time: Albertine Gone&quot;). The words scattered on the floor of the illustration are from the same book.

==Editions==

The original edition was issued in two volumes:
* Luigi Serafini, &quot;Codex Seraphinianus&quot;, Milano: Franco Maria Ricci [I segni dell&#x27;uomo, 27–28], 1981, 127+127 pp., 108+128 plates, + .

Two years later, a single-volume edition was issued in the United States, in Germany and in the Netherlands:
* 1st American edition, New York: Abbeville Press, 1983, 370 pp., ;
* Munich: Prestel, 1983, 370 pp., ;
* Amsterdam: Meulenhoff/Landshoff, 1983, .

The 1980s editions were out of print for several years before Franco Maria Ricci published an augmented, single-volume edition in 1993:

* French augmented edition, with a preface by Italo Calvino, transl. by Yves Hersant and Geneviève Lambert, Milano: Franco Maria Ricci [Les signes de l&#x27;homme, 18], 1993, 392 pp., ;
* Spanish augmented edition, with a preface by Italo Calvino, transl. by C. Alonso, Milano: Franco Maria Ricci [Los signos del hombre, 15], 1993, 392 pp., .

In 2006, Rizzoli published an expanded, but less expensive, edition in Italy. It features additional illustrations and a preface by the author:

* Milano: Rizzoli, 2006, 384 pp., ;
* Milano: Rizzoli, 2008, 384 pp.

In 2013, Rizzoli published a second revised edition, as well as limited, signed, and numbered &quot;deluxe&quot; edition. They printed 300 copies in Italian and 300 in English:

* Milano: Rizzoli, 2013, 396 pp., 

In 2016, a 2017 &quot;Codex Seraphinianus&quot; wall calendar was published by Universe Publishing.

* Universe Publishing, 2016, 24 pp., 

Rizzoli published a 40th anniversary edition of &quot;Codex Seraphinianus&quot; with some additional material in 2021. 
* Milano: Rizzoli, 2021, 416pp., 

==Reception==

Baird Searles, in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; (April 1984), says &quot;the book lies in the uneasy boundary between surrealism and fantasy, given an odd literary status by its masquerade as a book of fact&quot;.

Douglas Hofstadter, in &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot;, finds many of the illustrations &quot;grotesque and disturbing&quot; and others &quot;extremely beautiful and visionary&quot;. He says the book &quot;seems [to some people] to glorify entropy, chaos, and incomprehensibility&quot;.

American journalist Jim Dwyer finds that the work is an early critique of the Information Age.

<text>Longchen Rabjam Drimé Özer (), commonly abbreviated to Longchenpa (1308–1364, an honorific meaning &quot;The One Who Is the Vast Cosmic Expanse&quot;) was a Tibetan scholar-yogi of the Nyingma school (&#x27;Old School&#x27;) of Tibetan Buddhism. According to tibetologist David Germano, Longchenpa&#x27;s work led to the dominance of the Longchen Nyingthig lineage of Dzogchen (Great Perfection) over the other Dzogchen traditions. He is also responsible for the scholastic systematization of Dzogchen thought within the context of the wider Tibetan Vajrayana tradition of philosophy which was highly developed at the time among the Sarma schools. Germano also notes that Longchenpa&#x27;s work is &quot;generally taken to be the definitive expression of the Great Perfection with its precise terminological distinctions, systematic scope, and integration with the normative Buddhist scholasticism that became dominant in Tibet during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.&quot;

Longchenpa is known for his voluminous writings, including the highly influential &quot;Seven Treasuries&quot; and his compilation of Dzogchen scripture and commentaries, the &quot;Nyingthig Yabshi (The Inner Essence in Four Parts). Longchenpa was also a terton (treasure revealer) and some of his works, like the &quot;Khadro Yangtig,&quot; are considered terma (revealed treasure texts). Longchenpa&#x27;s oeuvre (of over 270 texts) encapsulates the core of Nyingma thought and praxis and is a critical link between the school&#x27;s exoteric (or sutra) and esoteric (i.e. tantric) teachings. Longchenpa&#x27;s work also unified the various Dzogchen traditions of his time into a single system. Longchenpa is known for his skill as a poet and his works are written in a unique literary voice which was widely admired and imitated by later Nyingma figures.

Longchenpa was the abbot of Samye, one of Tibet&#x27;s most important monasteries and the first Buddhist monastery established in the Himalayas. However, he spent most of his life travelling or in retreat.

==Biography==

=== Youth ===
Longchen Rabjam was born in 1308 in a village in the Dra Valley in Yuru, U-Tsang. He was born to the Nyingma lama Lopon Tsensung, a descendent of the Rog clan. Longchenpa&#x27;s mother died when he was nine and his father died two years after. After being orphaned, he entered Samye monastery in 1320 under the Abbot Sonam Rinchen and master Lopon Kunga Ozer. Longchenpa was an avid student with a great capacity for memory.

In 1327, Longchenpa moved to the Kadam monastic college of Sangpu Neutok, the most esteemed center of learning in Tibet at the time. He stayed for six years at Sangpu, mastering the entire scholastic curriculum of logical-epistemology, yogacara and madhyamaka as well as poetics. During this period, Longchenpa also received teachings and transmissions from different Tibetan Buddhist traditions, including Kadam, Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma. Longchenpa studied under various teachers, including the famous Third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje (1284-1339), from whom he received the six yogas of the Kālacakra and the six dharmas of Nāropa.

Longchenpa left Sangpu to practice in the solitude of the mountains, after coming into conflict with certain Khampa scholars. After leaving Sangpu, Longchenpa entered a period of retreat for eight months in complete darkness (winter 1332–1333), where he had some important visions of a young girl who promised to watch over him and grant him blessings. Afterwards, Longchenpa met his main teacher, the Ngagpa Rigdzin Kumaradza (1266-1343), from whom he received Dzogchen teachings while traveling from valley to valley with a nomadic group of about seventy students. It is said Longchenpa lived in great poverty during this period, sleeping on a sack and eating only barley.

Longchenpa accompanied Kumaradza and his disciples for two years, during which time he received all of Rigdzin Kumaradza&#x27;s transmissions (mainly focusing on the &quot;Vima Nyingthig&quot; and the &quot;Khandro Nyingthig)&quot;. Longchenpa was permitted to teach after a three-year period of retreat (1336-1338) in mChims phu, not far from Samye (according to the &quot;mThong snang ’od kyi dra ba&quot;, other sources give longer periods like six years). He is said to have had various visions of different deities, including Padmasambhava, black Vajravārāhī, Guru drag po, and the goddess Adamantine Turquoise Lamp (&quot;rDo rje gyu sgron ma&quot;)

=== Mature period ===
Longchenpa then gathered a group of eight disciples (men and women) in order to initiate them into the Dzogchen teachings (in 1340). During this initial period of teaching, Longchenpa and his disciples experienced a series of visions of dakinis and states of possession (the possessions only happened to the women of the group) which convinced him and his disciples that Longchenpa was destined to teach the Dzogchen Nyingthig tradition of the Esoteric Instruction series.

Longchenpa also embarked on a project of compiling the main texts of the &quot;Vima Nyingthig&quot; and the &quot;Khandro Nyingthig&quot; along with a series of his own commentaries on these works. Most of Longchenpa&#x27;s mature life was spent in his hermitage at Gangri Thokar, either in meditation retreat or studying and composing texts.

In 1350, at the age of 42, Longchenpa had a vision of Vimalamitra which asked him to restore the temple of Zhai Lhakhang (where the &quot;Seventeen Tantras&quot; had been concealed by Nyang Tingdzin Zangpo). In the process of this work, Longchenpa took on a Drikung Kagyu student named Kunga Rinchen. Kunga Rinchen had political designs and came into conflict with the powerful Changchub Gyaltsen, who had the support of the Mongol Authorities in Beijing and attacked Kunga Rinchen&#x27;s monastery.

Longchenpa fled to Bumthang, Bhutan to avoid conflict. Here he relinquished his monastic vows, married and had a daughter and a son. He also founded a series of small monasteries in Bhutan, including Tharpa Ling, his main residence. Longchenpa&#x27;s lineage survives in Bhutan. After living in Tharpa Ling for 10 years, he returned to Tibet and was reconciled with Changchub Gyaltsen, who even became Longchenpa&#x27;s student.

=== Legacy ===
Longchenpa&#x27;s writings and compilations were highly influential, especially on the Nyingma tradition. According to Germano, Longchenpa&#x27;s work:
had an immediate impact, and in subsequent centuries was to serve as the explicit model for many Nyingma compositions. In particular, his Seminal Heart writings were intensely philosophical as well as contemplative, and architectonic in nature. Though on the whole their characteristic doctrines and terminology are present in the earlier literature stemming from ICe btsun seng ge dbang phyug onwards, their terminological precision, eloquent style, systematic range and structure, and integration with normative Buddhist discourse constitute a major innovation in and of themselves.

A detailed account of Longchenpa&#x27;s life and teachings is found in &quot;Buddha Mind&quot; by Tulku Thondup Rinpoche, &quot;A Marvelous Garland of Rare Gems&quot; by Nyoshul Khenpo, and &quot;The Life of Longchenpa&quot; by Jampa Mackenzie Stewart. Pema Lingpa, the famous &quot;terton&quot; (finder of sacred texts) of Bhutan, is regarded as the immediate reincarnation of Longchenpa.

==Worldview==

=== View of Dzogchen ===
Longchenpa is widely considered the single most important writer on Dzogchen teachings. He was a prolific author and scholar, as well as a compiler of Dzogchen texts. According to David Germano, Longchenpa&#x27;s work systematized the Dzogchen tradition and its extensive literature while also providing it with a scholastic and philosophical structure based on the standard doctrinal structures that were becoming dominant in the Tibetan Buddhism of late tenth to thirteenth centuries.

According to Germano, Longchenpa&#x27;s main Dzogchen scriptural sources were: &quot;(i) the &quot;Kun byed rgyal po&quot;, (ii) &quot;The Seventeen Tantras of the Great Perfection&quot; (including two closely affiliated tantras—the &quot;kLong gsal&quot; and &quot;Thig le kun gsal&quot;) (iii) the &quot;Seminal Heart system of Vimalamitra&quot; (&quot;Bi ma snying thig&quot;) and (iv) the &quot;Seminal Heart system of the Dakini&quot; (&quot;mKha&#x27; &#x27;gro snying thig&quot;).&quot; Longchenpa&#x27;s Dzogchen philosophy is based on the Dzogchen view outlined in these tantric texts. This worldview sees all phenomena (&quot;dharmas&quot;, Tib. &quot;chos)&quot; as the emanations or expressions (&quot;rtsal&quot;), displays (&quot;rol pa&quot;), and adornments (&quot;rgyan&quot;) of an ultimate nature or principle (&quot;Dharmatā,&quot; Tib. &quot;chos nyid,&quot; or &quot;Dharmadhātu,&quot; Tib. &quot;chos kyi dbyings&quot;)

This ultimate principle is described in various ways by Longchenpa, using terminology that is unique to Dzogchen, such as the basis or ground (&quot;gzhi&quot;) or the &quot;nature of mind&quot; (&quot;sems nyid&quot;). Longchenpa describes this fundamental basis as being primordially pure and empty while also having the nature of a subtle self-arising awareness. This empty and spontaneous primordial glow (&quot;ye gdangs&quot;) is the subtle basis for the arising of all phenomenal appearances.

Longchenpa brought Dzogchen thought more closely into dialogue with scholastic Buddhist philosophy and the Sarma tantric systems which were normative in the Tibetan academic institutions of his time. One of Longchenpa&#x27;s main motivations was to provide a learned defense of Dzogchen thought and practice. Longchenpa&#x27;s writings also intended to prove the overall superiority of the Dzogchen path over the other eight vehicles of sutra and tantra. His work also posits that this supreme Dzogchen view is not just the pinnacle of Buddhism (which Longchenpa compares the peak of a mountain), but it is in fact a keystone to the entire Buddhist Dharma, without which the &quot;lower vehicles&quot; cannot be fully understood or justified (just like one cannot see the entirety of a mountain unless one is at the top).

In his &quot;Theg mchog mdzod&quot;, Longchenpa also provides an extensive doxography of Buddhism (based on the nine yanas) in order to explain why Dzogchen (i.e. Atiyoga) deserves the highest rank in this doxography. Longchenpa&#x27;s understanding of the relationship between Dzogchen and the lower vehicles is inclusive, and he sees Dzogchen as embracing all of the eight vehicles while also sublimating and transcending them.

=== Dzogchen practice ===
Longchenpa categorized Dzogchen as a teaching within &quot;secret mantra&quot; (Vajrayana), and specifically, he considered it to be part of the perfection stage of secret mantra practice, defining this &quot;great perfection phase&quot; (&quot;rdzogs rim chenpo&quot;), as &quot;resting in the pristine unfabricated enlightening-mind of awareness&quot; (in his &quot;bSam gtan ngal gso&quot; 80.2). Furthermore, Longchenpa defended the validity of Dzogchen as a stand-alone system of formless and effortless perfection stage practice, which did not require preliminary practice of the generation stage of deity yoga (unlike other tantric systems) nor standard tantric initiation rituals. Instead, for Longchenpa, the practice of Dzogchen merely relies on a pointing out (&quot;sems khrid&quot;) of the mind&#x27;s nature in an encounter with a teacher.

In his &quot;Grub mtha&#x27; mdzod&quot;, Longchenpa describes how Dzogchen transcends the classic tantric generation and perfection stages which for him are based on effort, mental constructs and fixation. For Longchenpa, Dzogchen relies on simple (&quot;spros med&quot;) and more natural methods which are based on the recognition of the nature of the mind and the Dzogchen view (&quot;Ita ba&quot;) of reality. Longchenpa also argues that this Dzogchen method is &quot;superior to that of stress-filled actualization involved in ordinary generation and perfection&quot; (&quot;Zab mo yang tig&quot; vol. 11, 344.2-6).

In the root verses and auto-commentary to his chapter on meditation within &quot;The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu&quot; (&quot;chos dbyings mdzod&quot;), Longchenpa placed strong emphasis on the importance of the practice of the &quot;four ways of resting&quot; in the nature of awareness (&quot;cog gzhag bzhi&quot;) and the &quot;three samadhis&quot; (&quot;ting nge &#x27;dzin gsum&quot;), offering also detailed explanations for their practice. In the foreword to the book &quot;The Meditations of Longchen Rabjam&quot;, Thrangu Rinpoche explicitly notes:One of the most renowned presentations of Dzogchen is given in Longchen Rabjam’s &quot;Chöying Dzöd&quot;. This text gives clear instructions on how to develop the view and practice the meditation of resting in the nature of awareness. Studying and practicing these meditations will be of great benefit to everyone who encounters these instructions.

Longchenpa also critiques tantric perfection stage methods (such as the six yogas of Naropa) which focus on manipulating the winds (&quot;vayu&quot;) in the channels (&quot;nadis&quot;) of the subtle body in order to confine them into the central channel. Longchenpa sees these techniques are inferior, because they are strenuous and forceful and may lead to delusory appearances. Longchenpa contrasts these tantric techniques with those of Dzogchen in which &quot;the winds are left to naturally calm down of their own accord, there is no insertion into the central channel.&quot;

Germano describes Longchenpa&#x27;s view on this topic as follows:In his &quot;Grub mtha&#x27; mdzod&quot; kLong chen rab &#x27;byams pa also incisively criticizes these normative modernist tantric practices of forcefully inserting the energy winds into the central channel in the attempt to achieve primordial gnosis. He contrasts this to Great Perfection contemplation in which the body&#x27;s luminous channels are let be, and thus naturally expand outwards from their current presence as a thin thread of light at the body&#x27;s center, so as to directly permeate one&#x27;s entire existence and dissolve all energy blockages therein. He retains the emphasis on the body&#x27;s center and light-experiences, yet undercuts the tone of control and manipulation.

== Works ==
Longchenpa wrote over 270 works according to Tulku Thondup.

=== Seven treasuries ===
&quot;The Seven Treasuries&quot; (&quot;mdzod bdun&quot;), which elucidate the meaning of the Nyingma school&#x27;s worldview and Dzogchen, are his most influential and famous original treatises.

The &quot;Seven Treasuries&quot; are:

* &quot;The Wish Fulfilling Treasury&quot; (Tib. ཡིད་བཞིན་མཛོད་, &quot;Yishyin Dzö&quot;; Wyl. &quot;yid bzhin mdzod&quot;, YZD), it has a long prose commentary, the &quot;White Lotus&quot; (&quot;padma dkar po&quot;). This text mainly deals with classic Buddhist topics common to all schools of Tibetan Buddhism and could be classified as a Lamrim type work according to Germano.
* &quot;The Treasury of Pith Instructions&quot; (Tib. མན་ངག་མཛོད་, &quot;Mengak Dzö&quot;; Wyl. &quot;man ngag mdzod&quot;, MND), a short text which consists of advice for meditative contemplation and which only deals in passing with Dzogchen topics.
* &quot;The Treasury of Philosophical Systems&quot; (Tib. གྲུབ་མཐའ་མཛོད་, &quot;Drubta Dzö&quot;; Wyl. &quot;grub mtha&#x27; mdzod,&quot; GTD), a work of the &quot;tenets&quot; ( &quot;grub mtha&#x27;,&quot; Skt. &quot;siddhanta&quot;) genre which gives a systematic and doxographic account of the various Buddhist philosophical views. Longchenpa uses the nine yanas schema in this work to discuss the various Buddhist philosophies, and naturally places Dzogchen at the pinnacle.
* &quot;The Treasury of Word and Meaning&quot; (Tib. ཚིག་དོན་མཛོད་, &quot;Tsik Dön Dzö&quot;; Wyl. &quot;tshig don mdzod,&quot; TDD), a shorter overview of Dzogchen thought and practice which follows the outline of the &quot;eleven vajra topics&quot;.
* &quot;The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle&quot; (Tib. ཐེག་མཆོག་མཛོད་, &quot;Tekchok Dzö&quot;; Wyl. &quot;theg mchog mdzod&quot;, TCD), a large commentary on all topics of the Dzogchen tradition found in the Seventeen Tantras which provide a wide-ranging and systematic account of Dzogchen that goes into much more detail than the &quot;Tsik Dön Dzö&quot;.
* &quot;The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu&quot; (Tib. ཆོས་དབྱིངས་མཛོད་, &quot;Chöying Dzö&quot;; Wyl. &quot;chos dbyings mdzod,&quot; CBD), a poem with a prose commentary called the &quot;Treasure Trove of Scriptural Transmissions&quot; (&quot;lung gi gter mdzod&quot;). This is a free ranging poetic work which discusses Dzogchen topics in much less comprehensive manner. According to Germano this can be seen as &quot;a hymn to the mind of enlightenment (which is synonymous with the Great Perfection).&quot;
* &quot;The Treasury of the Natural State&quot; (Tib. གནས་ལུགས་མཛོད་, &quot;Neluk Dzö&quot;; Wyl. &quot;gnas lugs mdzod,&quot; NLD), a poem with its prose commentary, the &quot;Desum Nyingpo&quot; (&quot;sde gsum snying po).&quot; This work mainly discusses the four samayas or commitments of Dzogchen (ineffability, openness, spontaneous presence, and oneness).

According to Germano, the &quot;Tsik Dön Dzö&quot; and the &quot;Tekchok Dzö&quot; together constitute Longchenpa&#x27;s primary scholastic work on the Dzogchen tradition.

=== &quot;Nyingthig Yabshi&quot; ===
Longchenpa compiled various Dzogchen Menngagde scriptures (including the &quot;Seventeen Tantras&quot;) into the collection known as the &quot;Nyingthig Yabshi&quot; (&quot;The Inner Essence in Four Parts&quot;). In this compilation, Longchenpa combines his editions of the &quot;Vima Nyingtig&quot; and the &quot;Khandro Nyingthig,&quot; along with his own commentaries on these cycles (the &quot;Lama Yangtik&quot; and the &quot;Khandro Yangtik&quot; respectively)&quot;.&quot; Longchenpa also composed a supplementary commentary to the &quot;Nyingthig Yabshi,&quot; called the &quot;Zabmo Yangtig.&quot;

According to Germano, Longchenpa&#x27;s compilation &quot;brought much needed order and organizational clarity to the at times chaotic mass of the Vimalamitra-transmitted Seminal Heart scriptures inherited from Kumaradza.&quot;

=== Other works ===
Some of his other important original compositions include:

* &quot;The&quot; &quot;Trilogy of Natural Freedom&quot; (&quot;rang grol skor gsum&quot;), mainly focuses on Mind Series (semde) forms of contemplation.
* &quot;The&quot; &quot;Trilogy of Natural Ease&quot; (&quot;ngal gso skor gsum&quot;), provides a graduated lamrim (stages of the path) style approach to Dzogchen practice.
* &quot;The&quot; &quot;Trilogy of Dispelling Darkness,&quot; three commentaries on the &quot;Guhyagarbha Tantra&quot; (&quot;The Nucleus of Mystery&quot;) which draw on the Dzogchen texts as well
* A commentary on the &quot;Kunyed Gyalpo Tantra&quot;
*&quot;The Triumph over Error&quot; (&quot;’Khrul pa rab &#x27;joms&quot;)
*&quot;The Melodious Thunderclap of Brahmā&quot; (&quot;sNgags kyi spyi don tshangs dbyangs ’brug sgra&quot;).

<doc id="73195" wikidata="Q445460" url="?curid=73195" title="Shantideva">
<text>Shantideva (Sanskrit: Śāntideva; ; ; ; ) was an 8th-century CE Indian philosopher, Buddhist monk, poet, and scholar at the mahavihara of Nalanda. He was an adherent of the Mādhyamaka philosophy of Nāgārjuna. Abhayadatta Sri also lists Shantideva as one of the eighty-four mahasiddhas and is known as Bhusuku Pa (布苏固巴).

Two works of Shantideva are extant, the &quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot; and the &quot;Śikṣāsamuccaya&quot;, both of which were written with the intention of being training manuals for one who intends to follow the path of the bodhisattva. The Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra in particular was the subject of both Indian and Tibetan commentaries during the period it was written and has also received large amounts of attention from both academics and lay practitioners in recent years as well including a commentary written by the 14th Dalai Lama.

==Biography==

There are two sources of Shantideva&#x27;s life composed by the Tibetan historians; Buton Rinchen Drub and Taranatha. Recent scholarship has also brought to light a short Sanskrit life of Shantideva in a 14th-century Nepalese manuscript. 

According to one source, Shantideva was born in the Saurastra region (in modern-day Gujarat), son of a King Kalyanavarman, and went by the name Śantivarman. But Vibhūticandra&#x27;s &quot;Bodhicaryāvatāratātparyapañjikā Viśeṣadyotanī&quot;, the earliest extant biography of Shantideva, details that he was born in Southern India, in the city of Sringara, and his father was a King Mañjuśrīvarman. As per Vibhūticandra, Shantideva ran away from home on the advice of his mother and travelled to Bengal and then Magadha. He served in the court of a Magadhan king and after leaving, arrived in Nalanda. During his stay in Nalanda, he was given the nickname, Bhūsuku due to his practice of Samadhi.

According to Pema Chödrön, &quot;Shantideva was not well-liked at Nalanda&quot; due to his idleness.

According to legend, Shantideva was goaded by his fellow monks into giving a talk to the entire university body while sitting on a large lion throne with the hope that on being exposed as unable to recite any scriptures, he would leave the monastery on his own accord. Shantideva easily climbed the throne and recited stanza 9.35 of &quot;The Way of the Bodhisattva&quot;. The legend continues that at this point, the bodhisattva Manjushri appeared and then suddenly disappeared together with Shantideva. Following this event, when the monks investigated his cells, they discovered his three works, the Sūtrasamuccaya, the Śikṣāsamuccaya, and the completed Bodhicaryāvatāra.

===Conversionary activities in Magadha===
Bu Ston details several tales from Shantideva&#x27;s life which detail how he converted 500 Magadhans to Buddhism. It is said that Shantideva lived alongside the non-Buddhists while they were experiencing a natural disaster which led to them suffering from starvation. As he was appointed the head of these people, Shantideva demonstrated his supernatural abilities as he managed to make a single bowl of rice suffice for all of the 500. Similar stories are found in other sources detailing how Santideva would feed hundreds of beggars.

==Works==

===&quot;Śikṣāsamuccaya&quot;===
The &quot;Śikṣāsamuccaya&quot; (&quot;Training Anthology&quot;) is a prowith work in 19 chapters. It is organized as a commentary on 27 short mnemonic verses known as the &quot;Śikṣāsamuccaya Kārikā&quot;. It consists primarily of quotations (of varying length) from sūtras, authoritative texts considered to be the word of the Buddha—generally those sūtras associated with Mahāyāna tradition, including the &quot;Samadhiraja Sutra&quot;.

===&quot;Bodhicaryavatara&quot;===
Shantideva is particularly renowned as the author of the &quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot;. A variety of English translations exist, sometimes glossed as &quot;A Guide to the Bodhisattva&#x27;s Way of Life&quot; or &quot;Entering the Path of Enlightenment.&quot; It is a long poem describing the process of enlightenment from the first thought to full buddhahood and is still studied by Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhists today.

An introduction to and commentary on the &quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot; by the 14th Dalai Lama called &quot;A Flash of Lightning in the Dark of Night&quot; was printed in 1994. A commentary on the Patience chapter was provided by the Dalai Lama in &quot;Healing Anger&quot; (1997), and his commentaries on the Wisdom chapter are in &quot;Practicing Wisdom&quot; (2004). Kunzang Palden has written a commentary based on that given by Patrul Rinpoche, translated by the Padmakara Translation Group. Patrul was a wandering monk of great scholarship who dedicated his life to propagating the &quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot;.

==Philosophical views==

===Personal identity and free will===

Following the Buddha, Śāntideva believed that our innate investment in an inherent, personal, self or essence is not only groundless but toxic. Goodman suggests that Śāntideva also touches on the problem of free will in the &quot;Bodhicaryāvatāra&quot;, writing that &quot;whatever transgressions (aparādha) and vile actions (pāpa) there are, all arise through the power of conditioning factors, while there is nothing that arises independently.&quot;

===Ethical views===

In line with his views on personal identity and the nature of the self, Śāntideva wrote that one ought to &quot;stop all the present and future pain and suffering of all sentient beings, and to bring about all present and future pleasure and happiness&quot;, in what may have been &quot;the very earliest clearly articulated statement of that view, preceding Jeremy Bentham by approximately a thousand years&quot;.

His basis for preferring altruism over egoism is that &quot;the continuum of consciousness, like a queue, and the combination of constituents, like an army, are not real. The person who experiences suffering does not exist.&quot; Similarly, he asks, &quot;when happiness is dear to me and others equally, what is so special about me that I strive after happiness only for myself?&quot;

===Bodhicitta===
The Bodhisattva is the central focus for both of the texts attributed to Shantideva. Bodhicitta is the mind that is focused on attaining the status of bodhisattva. The early chapters of the Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra are focused on praising the virtuous qualities of bodhicitta and also on how to strengthen and maintain it.

Shantideva states:

Shantideva also argued that the development of Bodhicitta was beneficial not just to those who are following the path of the Bodhisattva but also to those who are pursuing their well-being and happiness. His view is that the mind of one who has developed Bodhicitta is the solution to countering mental afflictions (klesas) such as cravings (Taṇhā) and anger (krodha).

===Generosity===
References to generosity (known as Dāna in the Indian tradition), can be found throughout both of Shantideva&#x27;s extant works. Shantideva mainly views generosity as a specific mental state where an individual has renounced all of their possessions. It does not necessarily refer to the distribution of one&#x27;s own possessions. The bodhisattva achieves the mental state of &quot;generosity&quot; by renouncing three things; the body, the possessions, and karmic merit. This is viewed by Shantideva as an important requirement for one who is on the path of the Bodhisattva. Shantideva also states in the Bodhicaryāvatāra that he believes generosity to be beneficial by comparing it with nirvana:

Hence from this passage, Shatideva believes the perfection of generosity to be liberation. This conception of generosity is therefore twofold with generosity benefiting oneself and benefiting others at the same time.

<text>Amanda Craig (born 1959) is a British novelist, critic and journalist. 

==Early life==

Born in South Africa, Craig grew up in Italy before moving to London. Her parents were British journalist, author and UN Press Officer Dennis Craig and South African journalist Zelda Wolhuter, who left Johannesburg following the Sharpeville Massacre and the rise of apartheid. Craig studied at Bedales School and read English Literature at Clare College, Cambridge. After graduation, she worked briefly in advertising for J. Walter Thompson and Terence Conran before leaving to work as a cleaner for 18 months. She then became a journalist.

==Writing==
;Journalism
For ten years, she was the children&#x27;s books critic for &quot;The Times&quot; and a features writer for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. She has contributed to &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and BBC Radio 4. As a journalist, Craig won the British Press Awards 1995 Young Journalist of the Year and the 1997 Catherine Pakenham Award. She worked on the staff of &quot;Tatler&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; before becoming a freelance feature writer, literary critic and columnist for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, and &quot;The Observer&quot;. She judged the Whitbread Novel Award in 2005, the Booktrust Teen Book Award in 2008, and the 2018 Wingate Prize. Craig was dropped as a judge for the Mslexia Fiction &amp; Memoir Competition by women’s writing magazine &quot;Mslexia&quot; in September 2020 after she signed a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; condemning online abuse of J.K. Rowling.

;Novels
Craig has written a cycle of nine interconnected novels dealing with contemporary British society. Her 1996 novel &quot;A Vicious Circle&quot; was originally contracted to be published by Hamish Hamilton, but was cancelled after a libel threat from David Sexton, literary editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and former boyfriend of Craig&#x27;s at Cambridge, fifteen years previously. The novel was bought by Fourth Estate and published three months later. 

Although each novel can be read separately, they are linked to each other by common characters and themes, thus constituting a novel sequence. Craig has been cited as a state-of-the-nation novelist by Sameer Rahim in &quot;Prospect&quot; and by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Usually, Craig takes a minor character and makes him or her the protagonist of her next work. She has been praised by Allison Pearson in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; for her &quot;...wit, indignation, an ear for the telling phrase and an unflagging attention to all the individual choices by which we define ourselves – where we stand as a society and how we decline and fall.&quot;

Craig&#x27;s fourth novel, &quot;In a Dark Wood&quot;, concerned the interplay between fairytales and manic depression, and her fifth, &quot;Love in Idleness&quot;, updates Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, setting the story in a holiday villa near Cortona, Italy. Her sixth novel, &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot;, concerned with the lives of legal and illegal immigrants in London, was longlisted for the 2009 Baileys Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction.

Her seventh novel, &quot;The Lie of the Land&quot; (2017), depicted a London professional couple who can&#x27;t afford to divorce and move to Devon to a rented house which has been the scene of a murder, was cited as &quot;in the vanguard of the Brexit novel&quot; by Danuta Kean in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. It was praised by Henry Hitchings in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, who commented: &quot;An enjoyable, sharp-witted and at times knowingly melodramatic novel, it lives up to the promise of its title – diagnosing the state of the nation without becoming grandiose, and debunking a few quaint myths about the patterns and textures of rural life.&quot; It was BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book at Bedtime&quot; in August 2017. &quot;The Guardian&quot; chose it as one of the 2017 Books of the Year, as did &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, and &quot;The Telegraph&quot;.

Craig has set two of her novels, &quot;A Private Place&quot; and &quot;The Lie of the Land&quot;, in Devon, a county that she has compared to C. S. Lewis&#x27;s Narnia. In an interview with Jackie McGlone of &quot;The Glasgow Herald,&quot; Craig described how encountering the poverty of North Devon shocked her. Her eighth novel, &quot;The Golden Rule,&quot; was published in 2020 and was described as a &quot;wry comedy-cum-thriller reimagining of Patricia Highsmith &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;&quot;, &quot;offering comfort and wit, compassion and philosophical speculation,&quot; although one critic commented of the millennial protagonist: &quot;Craig’s language choices... make her seem weirdly prim. &quot;The Golden Rule&quot; was longlisted for the 2021 Women&#x27;s Prize for fiction. Her ninth novel was &quot;The Three Graces&quot; (2023), described by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; as &quot;smartly plotted but ultimately lightweight.&quot;

In 2023, it was announced that the rights to &quot;The Three Graces&quot; had been optioned by television company Monumental Television. 

Craig is interested in fairytales and children&#x27;s fiction, and was one of the first critics to praise J. K. Rowling, Philip Pullman, Cressida Cowell, Stephenie Meyer, Anthony Horowitz, Malorie Blackman and Suzanne Collins.

Craig gave the annual Trollope Society lecture in 2022 and the 2023 Dorothy L Sayers lecture, published in the Daily Telegraph stating that both had influenced her novels and her life-choices. 

Following her struggle to get &quot;A Vicious Circle&quot; published, she became an active campaigner with International PEN for the reform of UK libel laws.

In an opinion piece in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Craig asked why fiction remains obsessed by historical fiction and neglects the contemporary, saying she has &quot;set out to take the DNA of a Victorian novel – its spirit of realism, its strong plot, its cast of characters who are not passively shaped by circumstances but who rise to challenges or escape them.&quot; She has said in interviews that she considers writing contemporary fiction to be &quot;a moral duty&quot;.

;Other
Craig&#x27;s short stories have been published in &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and collections such as Valentine&#x27;s Day &quot;Duckworth&quot; and &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; &quot;Great Escapes&quot; in support of Childline.

In 2011, she contributed the short story &quot;Red Berries&quot; to an anthology supporting the Woodland Trust. The anthology, &quot;Why Willows Weep&quot;, has so far helped the Woodland Trust plant approximately 50,000 trees, and was re-released in paperback format in 2016. In 2017 she contributed the short story &quot;Metamorphosis 2&quot; about a celebrity inspired by Katie Hopkins who transforms into a gigantic cockroach to the anthology &quot;A Country of Refuge&quot; supporting refugees.

She has written forewords for the 2021 Abacus reissues of 5 novels by Beryl Bainbridge - &quot;Every Man For Himself&quot;, &quot;Master Georgie&quot;, &quot;The Birthday Boys&quot;, &quot;According to Queenie&quot; and &quot;The Bottle Factory Outing&quot;, 2 novels by Eva Ibbotson - &quot;The Secret Countess&quot; and &quot;A Glove Shop In Vienna&quot;, reissued by Macmillan - plus Alison Lurie&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;.

==Personal life==
Craig is married to British economist Rob Cohen, with whom she has two children. She lives in London and Devon.

<doc id="73198" wikidata="Q875645" url="?curid=73198" title="Conradh na Gaeilge">
<text>(; historically known in English as the Gaelic League) is a social and cultural organisation which promotes the Irish language in Ireland and worldwide. The organisation was founded in 1893 with Douglas Hyde as its first president, when it emerged as the successor of several 19th century groups such as the Gaelic Union. The organisation was a spearhead of the Gaelic revival and of &quot;Gaeilgeoir&quot; activism.

While Hyde succeeded in drawing unionists to the League, the organisation increasingly gave expression to the nationalist impulse behind the language revival. From 1915, members of its executive acknowledged the leadership of the Irish Republican Brotherhood in the struggle for Irish statehood. After the creation of the Irish Free State, and limited advances with respect to the teaching and official use of the language, many members transferred their commitment to the new institutions, political parties and education system.

In 2008, Conradh na Gaeilge adopted a new constitution, dropping the post-1915 references to &quot;Irish freedom&quot;, while reaffirming the ambition to restore Irish as the language of everyday life throughout Ireland. In Northern Ireland, it campaigned for an Irish Language Act. In the absence of an agreed Stormont executive, in 2022 the Westminster Parliament incorporated many of its proposed provisions in the Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Act.

== Foundation: &quot;De-Anglicising Ireland&quot; ==

&quot;Conradh na Gaeilge&quot;, the Gaelic League, a successor to Ulick Bourke&#x27;s earlier Gaelic Union, was formed in 1893, at a time when Irish as a spoken language appeared to be on the verge of extinction. Analysis of the 1881 Census showed that at least 45% of those born in Ireland in the first decade of the 19th century had been brought up as Irish speakers. Figures from the 1891 census suggested that just 3.5% were being raised speaking the language. Ireland had become an overwhelmingly English-speaking country. Spoken mainly by peasants and farm labourers in the poorer districts of the west of Ireland, Irish was widely seen, in the words of Matthew Arnold, as &quot;the badge of a beaten race.&quot;

The first aim of the League was to maintain the language in the &quot;Gaeltacht&quot;, the largely western districts in which spoken Irish survived. The late 20th-century &quot;Gaeilgeoir&quot; activist Aodán Mac Póilin notes, however, that &quot;the main ideological impact of the language movement was not in the &quot;Gaeltacht&quot;, but among English-speaking nationalists&quot;. The League developed &quot;both a conservationist and a revivalist role&quot;.

The League&#x27;s first president, Douglas Hyde (&quot;Dúbhghlás de hÍde&quot;), the son of a Church of Ireland rector from County Roscommon, helped create an ethos in the early days that attracted a number of unionists into its ranks. Remarkably, these included the Rev. Richard Kane, Grand Master of the Belfast Orange Lodge and organiser of the Anti-Home Rule Convention of 1892. But from the beginning there was an unresolved conflict between non-political rhetoric and the nationalism implicit in the League&#x27;s revivalist project.

With the aid of Eugene O&#x27;Growney (author of &quot;Simple Lessons in Irish&quot;) Eoin MacNeill, Thomas O&#x27;Neill Russell and others, the League was launched in the wake of an address Hyde delivered to the Irish National Literary Society, on 25 November 1892: ‘&quot;The Necessity for De-Anglicising Ireland’&quot;. Citing Giuseppe Mazzini (the Italian nationalist who had been the inspiration for the rare language enthusiast among the Young Irelanders, Thomas Davis), Hyde argued that &quot;in Anglicising ourselves wholesale we have thrown away with a light heart the best claim we have to nationality&quot;.

Implicitly, this was a criticism of the national movement as it had developed since Catholic emancipation. Although a gaeilgeoir, Daniel O&#x27;Connell had declared himself &quot;sufficiently utilitarian not to regret [the] gradual abandonment&quot; of the language. For Emancipator&#x27;s keenest supporters, the &quot;positive and unmistakable&quot; mark of distinction between Irish and English was &quot;the distinction created by religion&quot;. Hyde&#x27;s project spoke to a new exclusionary sense of what it is to be Irish. The simple practice of referring to Gaelic as &quot;the Irish language&quot;, consciously or not, rendered &quot;those who did not speak it as less Irish, and those who did not even acknowledge its status as non-Irish&quot;.

The League rapidly developed into the leading institution promoting the Gaelic Revival, organising Irish classes and student immersions in the Gaeltacht, and publishing in Irish. The League&#x27;s first newspaper was &quot;An Claidheamh Soluis&quot; (The Sword of Light) and its most noted editor was Pádraig Pearse. The motto of the League was &quot;Sinn Féin, Sinn Féin amháin&quot; (Ourselves, Ourselves alone).

== Early campaigns ==
Among the League&#x27;s few campaign successes in its first decade was acceptance by the Post Office of parcels and letters addressed in Irish, and the recognition of St. Patrick&#x27;s Day as a national holiday.

With national feeling heightened in part by the Boer War, membership increased from 1900. The number of branches rose from 43 in 1897 to 600 in 1904 with a membership of 50,000. A more substantial victory followed: in 1904 Irish was introduced into the national school curriculum.

The Catholic church, however, was not an early ally. The clergy had played a significant role in the decline of the language. In the National schools they had punished children for speaking it (a legacy, in part, of the Irish-language missionary activity of the Protestant churches).

== The national cause ==

Hyde declared that &quot;The Irish language, thank God, is neither Protestant nor Catholic, it is neither a Unionist nor a Separatist.&quot; Although the League took this non-political principle seriously enough to decline participation in the unveiling of a 1798 centenary monument to Wolfe Tone, much like the Gaelic Athletic Association the organisation served as an occasion and cover for nationalist recruitment. Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly recalls that, as early 1903, as a travelling manager for &quot;An Claidheamh Soluis,&quot; he was in a position to recruit young men for Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) in every one of 32 counties. It was through the League that many future leaders of the independence struggle first met, laying the foundation for groups such as the Irish Volunteers (1913).

&quot;While being non-political&quot;, Michael Collins saw the League, by &quot;its very nature&quot;, as &quot;intensely national&quot;. Under a system of foreign rule that made the people &quot;forget to look to themselves, and to turn their backs upon their own country&quot;, it did &quot;more than any other movement to restore national pride, honour and self-respect&quot;. Arthur Griffith had been similarly dismissive of the League&#x27;s political neutrality of the League. Popular support for the revival of the language, he argued, sprang precisely from its role as a mark of Irish nationality.

As the nationalist impulse behind the League became more obvious, and in particular as the League began to work more closely with the Catholic Church to secure support for teaching Irish in the schools, Unionists withdrew. Hyde&#x27;s effort to leave space for unionists was lost. They were themselves moving toward a distinct Ulster unionism which rejected any form of Irish cultural identity.
Increasingly Republicans were blunt about what they saw as the League&#x27;s place within the nationalist movement. The paper, &quot;Irish Freedom&quot;, declared:The work of the Gaelic League is to prevent the assimilation of the Irish nation by the English nation [...] The work is as essentially anti-English as the work attempted by Fenianism or the Society of United Irishmen [...] The Irish language is a political weapon of the first importance against English encroachment.The issue of the League&#x27;s political independence was decided at its Annual General Meeting held in Dundalk in 1915. Rumours circulated that John Redmond&#x27;s Irish Parliamentary Party were seeking to take over the League as they had earlier attempted to take over the Irish Volunteers. Diarmuid Lynch of the IRB mobilised Brotherhood members positioned throughout the League to secure the nominations and votes required to appoint a new &quot;Coiste&quot; (executive) that &quot;was safe from the IRB viewpoint&quot;.

== Northern Protestants ==
The first Ulster branch of the Gaelic League was formed in east Belfast in 1895, a year after the death of Robert Shipboy MacAdam who, with Dr. James MacDonnell, had presided over a precursor of the League earlier in the century: &quot;Cuideacht Gaoidhilge Uladh / T&quot;he Ulster Gaelic Society (1828–1843). The new Belfast branch was formed under the active patronage (until he left to become Church of Ireland Lord Bishop of Ossory) of the Rev. John Baptiste Crozier and the presidency of his parishioner, Dr. John St Clair Boyd, both unionists, and of the Orange Order Grand Master, the Rev. Richard Rutledge Kane. Claiming to afford a &quot;common platform to Catholic and Protestant&quot;, by 1899 the League had nine branches in the city including one in the unionist Shankill ward where, in the 1911 census, 106 people recorded themselves as Irish speakers.

For other Protestant pioneers of the Irish language in the north the League was a non-sectarian door into the nationalist community with whom their political sympathies lay. This was the case for Alice Milligan, publisher in Belfast of &quot;The Shan Van Vocht.&quot; Milligan&#x27;s command of Irish was never fluent, and on that basis Patrick Pearse was to object when, in 1904, the Gaelic League hired her as a travelling lecturer. She proved herself by establishing new branches throughout Ireland and raising funds along the way. In the north, in Ulster, she focused on the more difficult task of recruiting Protestants, working with, among other activists, Hyde, Ada McNeill, Roger Casement, Alice Stopford Green, Stephen Gwynn, and Seamus McManus.

James Owen Hannay (better known as the novelist George A. Birmingham), originally of Belfast, was co-opted onto the League&#x27;s national executive body in December 1904 while a Church of Ireland (Anglican) rector in Westport in County Mayo. Hyde and Arthur Griffith sympathised with Hannay&#x27;s desire for a &quot;union of the two Irish democracies&quot;, Catholic in the south and Protestant in the north. In the north Hannay saw a potential ally in Lindsay Crawford and his Independent Orange Order. Like the &quot;Conradh na Gaeilge&quot;, he saw the IOO as &quot;profoundly democratic in spirit&quot; and independent of &quot;the rich and the patronage of the great&quot;.

Crawford, who stood for election to the League&#x27;s executive committee, was critical of what he regarded as the League&#x27;s impractical romanticism. In his paper, &quot;Irish Protestant&quot;, he suggested that the Irish Ireland movement needed an injection of &quot;Ulsteria&quot;, an &quot;industrial awakening on true economic lines: it is wrong when people crave bread to offer them &#x27;language and culture&#x27;&quot;.

Offence taken at his successful play &quot;General John Regan,&quot; and his defence of Crawford&#x27;s opposition to church control of education, strained Hannay&#x27;s relations with nationalists and he withdrew from League. Meanwhile, in North America, Crawford (who had found no political home in Ireland) went on to campaign with Eamon de Valera for recognition and support for the republic proclaimed in 1916.

Ernest Blythe, who joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1909 with the distinction of maintaining for three years his membership of the Orange Order, had as his first &quot;Conradh na Gaeilge&quot; teacher Sinéad Flanagan, de Valera&#x27;s future wife. To improve his knowledge of the Irish language, he lived in the County Kerry Gaeltacht earning his keep as an agricultural labourer. A similar path was followed by IRB organiser of the Irish Volunteers, Bulmer Hobson.

== Participation of women ==
Alice Milligan was exceptional among the League&#x27;s leading activists as a northern Protestant, but less so as a woman. All the priorities of the larger Irish-Ireland movement which developed around the revival of the language, including teaching children a national history and literature, and the use and consumption of Irish-made products, were associated with the sphere of home and community in which women were accorded initiative. In comparison to the political parties (whether republican or constitutionalist), organisations, like the League, promoting a cultural agenda were comparatively open and receptive to women.

The League encouraged female participation from the start and women filled prominent roles. Local notables, such as Lady Gregory in Galway, Lady Esmonde in County Wexford, and Mary Spring Rice in County Limerick, and others such as Máire Ní Shúilleabháin and Norma Borthwick, founded and led branches. In positions of trust, however, women remained a decided minority. At the annual national convention in 1906 women were elected to seven of the forty-five positions on the Gaelic League executive. Executive members included Máire Ní Chinnéide, Úna Ní Fhaircheallaigh (Agnes O&#x27;Farrelly, who wrote pamphlets on behalf of the League), Bean an Doc Uí Choisdealbha, Máire Ní hAodáin, Máire de Builtéir, Nellie O&#x27;Brien, Eibhlín Ní Dhonnabháin, and Eibhlín Nic Niocaill.

Máire de Builtéir, who is credited with suggesting the term Sinn Féin to Arthur Griffith, made it clear that women could make their contribution to the cultural revival without relinquishing their traditional roles. &quot;Let it be thoroughly understood&quot;, she insisted, &quot;that when Irish women are invited to take part in the language movement, they are not required to plunge into the vortex of public life. No the work they can best do is work to be done in the home. There mission is to make the homes of Ireland Irish&quot;.

== Criticism ==
Formed in the wake of the disgrace and fall of the nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell and defeat of the second Home Rule Bill, the League drew upon a generation frustrated and disillusioned with electoral politics. But proponents of new and rival movements were sceptical of the cultural activism offered by the League.

Writing in Alice Milligan&#x27;s Belfast monthly, labour and socialist leader James Connolly maintained that in the absence of a creed capable of challenging the rule of the capitalist, landlord and financier, the nationalism of the Irish language movement would achieve little. His friend and collaborator Frederick Ryan, secretary of the Irish National Theatre Society, acknowledged the &quot;pathos&quot; in that in &quot;young men and women rushing to acquire the rudiments of Irish (and it seldom gets beyond that) in order to show that they are not as other nations&quot;, but suggested that it did not &quot;correlate with the active desire for political freedom&quot;. Most leaders of the Gaelic League desired &quot;a return to medievalism in thought, in literature, in pastimes, in music and even in dress&quot;, but a nation, he argued, is not morally raised by dwelling on its past. Rather it must deal with its present political, economic, and social problems, something of which Ireland is capable without assuming &quot;the enormous burden of adopting what is now virtually a new language&quot;.

Patrick Pearse, who had joined the League while in his teens, responded in &quot;An Claidheamh Soluis&quot; by defending a &quot;critical traditionalism&quot;. The cultural self-belief promoted by the League does not call for &quot;folk attitudes of mind&quot; or &quot;folk conventions of form&quot;. Irish artists might have to &quot;imbibe their Irishness from the peasant, since the peasants alone possess Irishism, but they need not and must not [...] be afraid of modern culture&quot;. Deriving &quot;what is best in medieval Irish literature&quot;, the new Irish prose would be characterised by a &quot;terseness&quot;, &quot;crispness&quot;, and &quot;plain straightforwardness&quot; entirely conducive to the demands of the modern nation-state and economy.

== In the Irish Free State ==

With the foundation of the Irish Free State many members believed that the Gaelic League had taken language revival as far as it could and that the task now fell to the new Irish Government. They ceased their League activities and were absorbed into the new political parties and into state bodies such as the Army, Police, Civil Service, and into the school system in which Irish was made compulsory. With the organisation paying a less prominent role in public life, It fared badly in the 1925 Seanad election. All its endorsed candidates, including Hyde, were rejected.

From 1926 there was growing disquiet among League members over the government&#x27;s failure to implement the recommendations of its own Gaeltacht Commission. Despite being presided over by Blythe, one of their own, the Ministry of Finance baulked at the proposal for free secondary school education for Gaeltacht children (something that was not available anywhere in Ireland until the 1960s). The League was also alarmed by the Anglicising and cosmopolitan influences of state radio (great objection was made to its programming of Jazz). The failure of the Cumann na nGaedheal government to commit to a more comprehensive programme for defending and promoting Irish and what was perceived, typically in conservative folk terms, as its supporting culture, helped rally support for de Valera&#x27;s anti-Treaty republican party Fianna Fail. Partly in recognition of his services in the League services, under de Valera&#x27;s new constitution, Hyde served as the first President of Ireland from June 1938 to June 1945.

In 1927, An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha (CLRG) was founded as a subcommittee of the League to investigate the promotion of traditional Irish dance. Eventually, CLRG became a largely independent organisation, though it is required by its constitution to share three board members with the League.

== Contemporary campaigns for language rights ==
Conradh na Gaeilge, in alliance with other groups such as Gluaiseacht Chearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta, was instrumental in the community campaigns which led to the creation of RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta (1972), Údarás na Gaeltachta (1980), and TG4 (1996). The organisation successfully campaigned for the enactment of the Official Languages Act, 2003 which gave greater statutory protection to Irish speakers and created the position of (the Languages Commissioner). Conradh na Gaeilge was among the principal organisations responsible for co-ordinating the successful campaign to make Irish an official language of the European Union.

In 2008 during the presidency of Dáithí Mac Cárthaigh, Conradh na Gaeilge adopted a new constitution reverting to its pre 1915 non-political stance restating its aim as that of an Irish-speaking Ireland (&quot;It is the aim of the Organisation to reinstate the Irish language as the everyday language of Ireland&quot;) and dropping any reference to Irish freedom.

In recent years Conradh na Gaeilge has remained central to campaigns to protect language rights throughout Ireland. This strategy encompasses the promotion of increased investment in Gaeltacht areas, advocacy for increased provision of state services through Irish, the development of Irish language hubs in urban areas, and the Acht Anois campaign for the enactment of an Irish Language Act to protect the language in Northern Ireland.

The decision of the Democratic Unionist Party to resist a stand-alone Irish Language Act, in part by insisting on compensating provisions for Ulster Scots, became one of the principal, publicly acknowledged, sticking points in the three years of on and off again negotiations required to restore the power-sharing executive in 2020. The 2020 New Decade, New Approach agreement promised both the Irish language and Ulster-Scots new Commissioners to &quot;support&quot; and &quot;enhance&quot; their development but does not accord them equal legal status. While Ulster Scots was to be recognised as a regional or minority language for the &quot;encouragement&quot; and &quot;facilitation&quot; purposes of Part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, provision for Irish was to meet the more stringent Part III obligations in respect of education, media and administration.

In 2022, with unionist protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol having resulted in a further suspension of devolved government, the United Kingdom Parliament incorporated the language provisions of &quot;New Decade, New Approach&quot; in the Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Act. The president of the Conradh na Gaeilge, Paula Melvin, hailed the passing of the legislation, but said the bill was &quot;not our final destination&quot;. The organisation would turn its attention to both implementing and to strengthening the legislation: &quot;painful experience with the British government has taught us to take nothing for granted&quot;.

<text>Cambridge University Press was the university press of the University of Cambridge. Granted a letters patent by King Henry VIII in 1534, it was the oldest university press in the world. Cambridge University Press merged with Cambridge Assessment to form Cambridge University Press and Assessment under Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s approval in August 2021.

With a global sales presence, publishing hubs, and offices in more than 40 countries, it published over 50,000 titles by authors from over 100 countries. Its publications include more than 420 academic journals, monographs, reference works, school and university textbooks, and English language teaching and learning publications. It also published Bibles, runs a bookshop in Cambridge, sells through Amazon, and has a conference venues business in Cambridge at the Pitt Building and the Sir Geoffrey Cass Sports and Social Centre. It also served as the King&#x27;s Printer.

Cambridge University Press, as part of the University of Cambridge, was a non-profit organization. Cambridge University Press joined The Association of American Publishers trade organization in the Hachette v. Internet Archive lawsuit which resulted in the removal of access to over 500,000 books from global readers. 

== History ==
Cambridge University Press was the oldest university press in the world. It originated from letters patent granted to the University of Cambridge by Henry VIII in 1534. Cambridge was one of the two privileged presses (the other being Oxford University Press). Authors published by Cambridge have included John Milton, William Harvey, Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, and Stephen Hawking.

University printing began in Cambridge when the first practising University Printer, Thomas Thomas, set up a printing house in 1584. The first publication was a book, &quot;Two Treatises of the Lord His Holie Supper&quot;. In 1591, the first Cambridge Bible was printed by John Legate and in 1629, Cambridge folio edition of the King James Bible was printed by Thomas and John Buck.

In July 1697, the Duke of Somerset made a loan of £200 to the university &quot;towards the printing house and press&quot; and James Halman, Registrary of the university, lent £100 for the same purpose.

A new home for the press, The Pitt Building, on Trumpington Street in the centre of Cambridge was completed in 1833, which was designed by Edward Blore. It became a listed building in 1950.

In the early 1800s, the press pioneers the development of stereotype printing, allowing successive printings from one setting. The press began using steam-powered machine presses by the 1850s. It was in this period that the press turned down what later became the Oxford English Dictionary – a proposal for which was brought to Cambridge by James Murray before he turned to Oxford.

The press journals publishing programme began in 1893 with the &quot;Journal of Physiology&quot; and then the &quot;Journal of Hygiene and Biometrika&quot;. By 1910 the press had become a well-established journal publisher with a successful list which includes its first humanities title, &quot;Modern Language Review&quot;. 1956 saw the first issue of the &quot;Journal of Fluid Mechanics&quot;.

The press has published 170+ Nobel Prize winners, the first in 1895.

In 1913, the Monotype system of hot-metal mechanised typesetting was introduced at the press.

In 1949, the press opened its first international branch in New York.

The press moved to its current site in Cambridge in 1963. The mid-century modern building, University Printing House, was constructed in 1961–1963. The building was designed by Beard, Bennett, Wilkins and Partners.

In 1975, the press launched its English language teaching publishing business.

In 1981, the press moved to a new site on Shaftsbury Road. The Edinburgh Building was purpose-built with an adjoining warehouse to accommodate the press&#x27;s expansion. It was built in 1979–80 by International Design and Construction. The site was demolished in 2017 to make way for the construction of Cambridge Assessment&#x27;s Triangle Building.

In 1989, the press acquired the long-established Bible and prayer-book publisher Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, which gave the press the ancient and unique title of The Queen&#x27;s Printer.

In 1992, the press opened a bookshop at 1 Trinity Street, Cambridge, which was the oldest-known bookshop site in Britain as books have been sold there since 1581. In 2008 the shop expanded into 27 Market Hill where its specialist Education and English Language Teaching shop opened the following year. The press bookshop sells Press books as well as Cambridge souvenirs such as mugs, diaries, bags, postcards, maps.

In 1993, the Cass Centre was opened to provide sports and social facilities for employees and their families.

In 1999, Cambridge Dictionaries Online was launched.

In 2012, the press sold its printing operation to MPG Books Group and now uses third parties around the world to provide its print publications.

In 2019, the press released a new concept in scholarly publishing through Cambridge Elements where authors whose works are either too short to be printed as a book or too long to qualify as a journal article could have these published within 12 weeks.

In 2021, Cambridge University Press merged with Cambridge Assessment. The new organisation was called Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment.

In 2022, Amira Bennison was elected chair of the Cambridge University Press academic committee, replacing Kenneth Armstrong.

== Current publications ==
== Open access ==
Cambridge University Press has stated its support for a sustainable transition to open access. It offers a range of open access publishing options under the heading of Cambridge Open, allowing authors to comply with the Gold Open Access and Green Open Access requirements of major research funders. It published Gold Open Access journals and books and works with publishing partners such as learned societies to develop Open Access for different communities. It supports Green Open Access (also called Green archiving) across its journals and monographs, allowing authors to deposit content in institutional and subject-specific repositories. It also supports sharing on commercial sharing sites through its Cambridge Core Share service.

In recent years it has entered into several Read &amp; Publish Open Access agreements with university libraries and consortia in several countries, including a landmark agreement with the University of California. In its 2019 Annual Report, Cambridge University Press stated that it saw such agreements &quot;as an important stepping stone in the transition to Open Access&quot;.

In 2019, the press joined with the University of Cambridge&#x27;s research and teaching departments to give a unified response to Plan S, which calls for all publications resulting from publicly funded research to be published in compliant open access journals or platforms from 2020. The response emphasized Cambridge&#x27;s commitment to an open access goal which works effectively for all academic disciplines, was financially sustainable for institutions and high-quality peer review, and which leads to an orderly transition.

The press was a member of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association and the International Association of STM Publishers.

In 2023, more than 50 per cent of Cambridge University Press research articles are in open access mode.

== Organisational governance and operational structure ==

=== Relationship with the University of Cambridge ===
Cambridge University Press was a non-teaching department of the University of Cambridge. The press has, since 1698, been governed by the press &#x27;Syndics&#x27; (originally known as the &#x27;Curators&#x27;), 18 senior members of the University of Cambridge who, along with other non-executive directors, bring a range of subject and business expertise. The chair of the syndicate was currently Professor Stephen Toope (Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge). The syndicate has delegated its powers to a Press &amp; Assessment Board; and to an Academic Publishing Committee and an English Language Teaching &amp; Education Publishing Committee.

The Press &amp; Assessment Board was responsible for setting overarching strategic direction. The Publishing Committees provide quality assurance and formal approval of the publishing strategy.

The operational responsibility of the press was delegated by the Syndics to the secretary of the syndicate and chief executive.

In 2020 the university announced its decision to merge Cambridge University Press with Cambridge Assessment.

=== Operational structure ===
Until August 2021, Cambridge University Press had three publishing groups:

* Academic Publishing: published research books and journals in science, technology, medicine, humanities, and the social sciences. It also published advanced learning materials and reference content as well as 380 journals, of which 43 are &#x27;Gold&#x27; Open Access. Open Access articles now account for 15 per cent of articles. The group also published Bibles, and the press was one of only two publishers entitled to publish the Book of Common Prayer and the King James Version of the Bible in England.
* English Language Teaching: published English language teaching courses and resources for learners of all ages around the world. It offers a suite of integrated learning and assessment tools underpinned by the Cambridge Curriculum, a systematic approach to learning and evaluating proficiency in English. It works closely with Cambridge Assessment through the joint initiative Cambridge Exams Publishing.
* Education: delivers educational products, services and software for primary, secondary and international schools. It collaborates with Cambridge Assessment and the University of Cambridge Faculty of Education to help countries such as Kazakhstan and Oman to improve their education systems. It also works with Cambridge Assessment to reach more schools and develop new products and services that improve teaching and learning. This area was merging with the schools team at Cambridge Assessment
From 1 August 2021 onwards, Cambridge University Press became solely the academic and bible publishing division of Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment. The English and education arms of the organisation merged with the equivalent departments of Cambridge Assessment to form new, merged divisions.

== Cambridge University Press partnerships and acquisitions ==
* 2011, formed a partnership with Cambridge Assessment to publish official Cambridge preparation materials for Cambridge English and IELTS examinations.
* 2015, formed a strategic content and technology partnership with Edmodo, the world&#x27;s most extensive e-learning platform for primary and secondary teachers and pupils, to bring premier educational content and technology to schools in the United Kingdom. 
* 2017, the University of Cambridge announced that Cambridge University Press and Cambridge Assessment would work more closely in future under governance by the Press &amp; Assessment Board.
* 2019, with Cambridge Assessment English acquired the Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring from Durham. CEM provides assessments to measure learner progress and potential, as well as 11 Plus exams for many UK independent and grammar schools.
* 2020, partnered with EDUCATE Ventures, the University College London edtech accelerator, to better understand the challenges and successes of home education during the lockdown.
* 2020, partnered with online library Perlego to offer students access to digital textbooks.
* 2020, the University Cambridge announced it would create a &quot;new unified organization&quot; by merging Cambridge University Press and Cambridge Assessment, to launch 1 August 2021.
* 2021, Cambridge Assessment and Cambridge University Press formally became one organisation under the name Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment.

== Digital developments ==
In 2011, Cambridge University Press adopted SAP software. Cambridge University Press works closely with IT services firm Tech Mahindra on SAP, and with Cognizant and Wipro on other systems.

In 2016, Cambridge Books Online and Cambridge Journals Online were replaced by Cambridge Core – a single platform to access its publishing (&quot;the home of academic content from Cambridge University Press&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge.org/core/about&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;). It provided significantly enhanced interfaces and upgraded navigation capabilities, as well as article-level and chapter-level content selection. A year after Cambridge Core went live, the press launched Cambridge Core Share, functionality to allow users to generate and share links with free access to selected journal articles, an early sign of the press&#x27;s commitment to open research.

In 2020, partnered with online library Perlego to offer students access to digital textbooks.

In 2021, the press acquired CogBooks. The technology adapts and responds to users, &quot;recommending course material needed to optimise learning&quot;.

In 2021, the press began migrating its website onto Drupal.

== Controversies ==

===Tax exemption controversy===
In May 1940, CUP applied to the Inland Revenue for the exemption of its printing and publishing profits from taxation, equivalent to charitable status. After a November 1940 Inland Revenue hearing, CUP&#x27;s application was refused &quot;on the ground that, since the Press was printing and publishing for the outside world and not simply for the internal use of the University, the Press&#x27;s trade went beyond the purpose and objects of the University and (in terms of the Act) was not exercised in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the University&quot;. In November 1975, with CUP facing financial collapse, CUP&#x27;s chief executive Geoffrey Cass wrote a 60-page &quot;preliminary letter&quot; to the Inland Revenue again seeking tax-exemption. A year later Cass&#x27;s application was granted in a letter from the Inland Revenue, though the decision was not made public. After consulting CUP, Cambridge&#x27;s &#x27;sister&#x27; press, the giant Oxford University Press presented their own submission and received similar exemption. In 2003 OUP&#x27;s tax exemption was publicly attacked by Joel Rickett of The Bookseller in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 2007, with the new &#x27;public benefit&#x27; requirement of the revised Charities Act, the issue was re-examined with particular reference to the OUP. In 2008 CUP&#x27;s and OUP&#x27;s privilege was attacked by rival publishers. In 2009 &quot;The Guardian&quot; invited author Andrew Malcolm to write an article on the subject.

In 2007, from the National Archives at Kew, Malcolm obtained scans of CUP&#x27;s unsuccessful applications for tax-exemption made in the 1940s and 1950s and their later successful applications in the 1970s. He then indexed and posted these on the Akmedea website. Late in 2020, the papers held at Kew were withdrawn from public access and ruled closed for 50 years until 1 January 2029. This rendered the scans on the website their only public source.

In 2021, the documents were cited in a discussion on the formation of Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment reported in the Cambridge University Reporter. D.D.K.Chow of Trinity College, expressed concerns about the lack of academic leadership of the new body:

=== Alms for Jihad ===
In 2007, controversy arose over the press&#x27;s decision to destroy all remaining copies of its 2006 book &quot;Alms for Jihad: Charity and Terrorism in the Islamic World&quot;, by Burr and Collins, as part of the settlement of a lawsuit brought by Saudi billionaire Khalid bin Mahfouz. Within hours, &quot;Alms for Jihad&quot; became one of the 100 most sought after titles on Amazon.com and eBay in the United States. The press sent a letter to libraries asking them to remove copies from circulation. The press subsequently sent out copies of an &quot;errata&quot; sheet for the book.

The American Library Association issued a recommendation to libraries still holding &quot;Alms for Jihad&quot;: &quot;Given the intense interest in the book, and the desire of readers to learn about the controversy first hand, we recommend that U.S. libraries keep the book available for their users.&quot; The publisher&#x27;s decision did not have the support of the book&#x27;s authors and was criticized by some who claimed it was incompatible with freedom of speech and with freedom of the press and that it indicated that English defamation laws were excessively strict. In the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; (7 October 2007), United States Congressman Frank R. Wolf described Cambridge&#x27;s settlement as &quot;basically a book burning&quot;. The press pointed out that, at that time, it had already sold most of its copies of the book.

The press defended its actions, saying it had acted responsibly and that it was a global publisher with a duty to observe the laws of many different countries.

===&quot;Cambridge University Press v. Patton&quot;===
In this case, originally filed in 2008, CUP et al. accused Georgia State University of infringement of copyright. The case closed on 29 September 2020, with GSU as the prevailing party.

=== &quot;The China Quarterly&quot; ===
On 18 August 2017, following an &quot;instruction&quot; from a Chinese import agency, Cambridge University Press used the functionality that had been built into Cambridge Core to temporarily delete politically sensitive articles from &quot;The China Quarterly&quot; on its Chinese website. The articles focused on topics China regards as taboo, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Mao Zedong&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, the 2014 Hong Kong protests, and ethnic tensions in Xinjiang and Tibet. On 21 August 2017, in the face of growing international protests, Cambridge University Press announced it would immediately repost the articles to uphold the principle of academic freedom on which the university&#x27;s work was founded.

In a discussion reported in the Cambridge University Reporter, D.K.K.Chow declared, &quot;Without academic leadership on the matter, the University&#x27;s basic ethical values were cast aside by commercial considerations. This instigated public debate, which would have been avoided had academic leadership been more vigilant, causing unnecessary damage to the University&#x27;s reputation. The Press statement explained that lack of academic leadership was to blame: &#x27;This decision was taken as a temporary measure pending discussion with the academic leadership of the University.&#x27;&quot;

=== &quot;The Cambridge Handbook of Privatization&quot; ===
In February 2021, the forthcoming &quot;Cambridge Handbook of Privatization&quot; was found to have included a chapter by J. Mark Ramseyer in which he described Koreans murdered in the Kantō Massacre of 1923 as &quot;gangs&quot; that &quot;torched buildings, planted bombs, [and] poisoned water supplies&quot;. Editors Avihay Dorfman and Alon Harel acknowledged the historical distortions of the chapter, but gave Ramseyer a chance to revise. Harel described the inclusion of the original chapter as an &quot;innocent and very regrettable&quot; mistake on the part of the editors.

== Corporate social responsibility ==
=== Community ===
The press undertakes community engagement in Cambridge and around the world where there are Press employees. Annually, the press selects a UK Charity of the Year, which has included local charities Centre 33 (2016 and 2017), Rowan Humberstone (2018), and Castle School (2019). In 2016, some of the press&#x27;s community works included its continued support to Westchester Community College in New York, the installation of hygienic facilities in an Indonesian rural school, raising funds to rehabilitate earthquake-stricken schools in Nepal, and guiding students from Coleridge Community College, Cambridge in a CV workshop. On World Book Day 2016, the press held a digital Shakespeare publishing workshop for students and their teachers. Similarly, their Indian office conducted a workshop for teachers and students in 17 schools in Delhi to learn the whole process of book publishing. The press donated more than 75,000 books in 2016.

An apprenticeship programme for people interested in careers in publishing was established in 2016; by 2022 it had 200 active apprentices in the UK in a wide range of roles.

=== Environment ===
The press monitors its emissions annually, has converted to energy-saving equipment, minimizes plastic use and ensures that their paper was sourced ethically.

In 2019, the World Wildlife Fund awarded its highest score to the press of Three Trees, based on the press&#x27;s timber purchasing policy, performance statement and its responsible sourcing of timber. The press won the Independent Publishers Guild Independent Publishing Awards for sustainability in 2020 and in 2021. Its public commitments to sustainability include being a signatory of the UN Global Compact and to the goals of the Cambridge Zero initiative run by the University of Cambridge – to being carbon zero on all energy-related emissions by 2048.

Cambridge University Press was a signatory of the SDG Publishers Compact, and has taken steps to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the publishing industry. 
These include publishing a new set of open access journals known as Cambridge Prisms, relevant to the SDGs, that includes &quot;Coastal Futures&quot;, &quot;Precision Medicine&quot;, &quot;Global Mental Health&quot;, &quot;Extinction&quot;, &quot;Plastics&quot;, &quot;Water&quot; and &quot;Drylands&quot;. Cambridge also worked with the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP) to create the University Press Redux Sustainability Award in 2020. The inaugural award was given to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for its SDG Pathfinder, an open-access digital discovery tool for finding content and data relating to the SDGs.

<text>Castilla–La Mancha (, ; ) is an autonomous community of Spain. Comprising the provinces of Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara and Toledo, it was created in 1982. The government headquarters are in Toledo, which is the capital &quot;de facto&quot;.

It is a landlocked region largely occupying the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula&#x27;s Inner Plateau, including large parts of the catchment areas of the Tagus, the Guadiana and the Júcar, while the northeastern relief comprises the Sistema Ibérico mountain massif. It is one of the most sparsely populated of Spain&#x27;s regions, with Albacete, Guadalajara, Toledo, Talavera de la Reina and Ciudad Real being the largest cities.

Castilla–La Mancha is bordered by Castile and León, Madrid, Aragon, Valencia, Murcia, Andalusia, and Extremadura. Prior to its establishment as an autonomous community, its territory was part of the New Castile (&quot;Castilla la Nueva&quot;) region along with the province of Madrid, except for Albacete province, which was part of the former Murcia region.

== Geography ==

Castilla–La Mancha is located in the middle of the Iberian peninsula, occupying the greater part of the Submeseta Sur, the vast plain composing the southern part of the Meseta Central. The Submeseta Sur (and the autonomous community) is separated from the Submeseta Norte (and the community of Castilla y León) by the mountain range known as the Sistema Central. Despite this, the region has no shortage of mountain landscapes: the southern slopes of the aforementioned Sistema Central in the north, the Sistema Ibérico in the northeast, and the Sierra Morena and Montes de Toledo in the south.

Castilla–La Mancha is the third largest of Spain&#x27;s autonomous regions, with a surface area of , representing 15.7 percent of Spain&#x27;s national territory.

The regional urban structure is polycentric, with no dominant central city. Insofar the largest municipality (Albacete) is located in the peripheral southeast, Madrid (outside the region), exerts influence over the extension of the so-called into the province of Guadalajara (including the provincial capital) as well as the north of the province of Toledo. The rest of urban centres lie on the central plains (with for example, the presence of intermediate agro-cities in La Mancha), contrasting with the sparsedly populated mountains and other peripheral areas.

=== Relief ===
The Meseta is the dominant landscape unit of a great part of the territory of Castilla–La Mancha: a vast, uniform plain with little relief.

The west-to-east Montes de Toledo range cuts across the meseta separating the (northern) Tagus and the (southern) Guadiana drainage basins. The most outstanding peaks of this modest mountain range include La Villuerca () and Rocigalgo ().

In contrast, a more mountainous zone surrounds the Meseta and serves as the region&#x27;s natural border. In the north of the Province of Guadalajara, bordering Madrid and Segovia, is a mountain range forming part of the Sistema Central, among which can be distinguished the mountain ranges Pela, Ayllón, Somosierra, Barahona and Ministra, with the headwaters of the rivers Jarama, Cañamares and Henares. The Sistema Central also penetrates the northwest of the province of Toledo: a southwest to northeast sub-range known as the Sierra de San Vicente, bordered on the north by the Tiétar and on the south by the Alberche and the Tagus, rising up to its maximum heights at the summits of Cruces (1373 m), Pelados (1331 m) and San Vicente (1321 m).

On the northwest is the Sistema Ibérico, where there is important fluvial and especially karstic activity, which has given rise to such landscapes as the Ciudad Encantada, the Callejones de Las Majadas and the Hoces del Cabriel.

In the southeast is the ridge of the Sierra Morena, the southern border of the Meseta Central and the region&#x27;s border with Andalusia. Within the Sierra Morena, distinction can be made between the Sierra Madrona, Sierra de Alcudia and Sierra de San Andrés. At the other southern extreme of Castilla–La Mancha, the Sierra de Alcaraz and Sierra del Segura form part of the Sistema Bético.

=== Hydrography ===

The territory of Castilla–La Mancha is divided into five principal watersheds. The Tagus, Guadiana, and Guadalquivir drain into the Atlantic Ocean and the Júcar and Segura into the Mediterranean Sea. The Tagus provides water for some 587,000 inhabitants in a watershed of . It includes the entire province of Guadalajara and the greater part of the province of Toledo, including the two largest cities of the latter province: the capital, Toledo, as well as Talavera de la Reina.

The Guadiana watershed extends in Castilla–La Mancha, 37 percent of that river&#x27;s entire watershed, with a population of 583,259 inhabitants. It includes the southern part of the province of Toledo, nearly all of the province of Ciudad Real (except the very south), the southwest of the province of Cuenca and the northwest of the province of Albacete. The Guadalquivir watershed extends over 5.2 percent of the surface area of the autonomous community, extending through the southern parts of the provinces of Ciudad Real and Albacete, including such important population center as Puertollano.

The Júcar watershed had, in 2006, 397,000 inhabitants in an area of , 19.9 percent of the Castillian-Manchegan territory and 36.6 percent of total of the Júcar watershed. It includes the eastern parts of the provinces of Cuenca and Albacete, including their respective capitals. Finally, the 34 municipalities of southeastern Albacete fall in the Segura watershed, with an extent of .

=== Climate ===

The predominant climate in Castilla-La-Mancha is the hot summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;), while the cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) is also significant occupying most of the provinces of Toledo and Albacete. The warm summer mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;) can also be found, especially in the north of the community. To a lesser extent, there is the presence of an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) along the border with Aragon. 

Lack of a marine influence leads to much more extreme temperatures: hotter summers and quite cold winters, with a daily oscillation as high as on some areas. Summer is the driest season, with temperatures often exceeding , and temperatures above are common in several areas. In winter, temperatures often drop below , producing frosts on clear nights, and occasional snow on cloudy nights. Most of the community has continental influences, although the climate is not exactly continental, as the average temperatures in the coldest month are above . Annual temperature ranges can reach over .

Castilla–La Mancha is part of what has traditionally been called &quot;España Seca&quot; (&quot;Dry Spain&quot;). Precipitation in general is relatively scarce, even in areas with a Mediterranean climate, although there are areas that receive more than . Precipitation presents a notable gradient from the center of the region, where it does not surpass per year, to the mountains where it can exceed per year, on the slopes of the Sierra de Gredos and the Serranía de Cuenca. The greater part of the region has less than of rain annually. The driest area of Castilla-La-Mancha is in the southeast of the community, near the border with the Region of Murcia, where rainfall does not exceed .

==History==
=== Early human history of the territory ===
;Prehistory and protohistory
The presents material linked to the transition from earlier settlers to the Early Acheulean. Archaeological sites related to the Middle Acheulean in the current-day region lie on the Campo de Calatrava as well as in the source of the Villanueva river, the Guadiana catchment area and the Segura catchment area. The Upper Acheulean sites are mostly located within the limits of the current-day province of Ciudad Real, substantially increasing in number and territorial spread across the region for the ensuing Middle Paleolithic. The Upper Paleolithic in the region presents instances of the art of the Upper Paleolithic in the Serranía del Alto Tajo and the Upper Júcar. There are instances of Cardium pottery in Caudete from the Early Neolithic.
The natural region of La Mancha presents a number of archaeological sites related to the so-called Culture of Las Motillas of the Bronze Age, tentatively considered as the earliest reported case of human culture in Western Europe able to implement a system of underground water collection, whose installment is possibly connected to the surface water crisis caused by the 4.2 kiloyear event. A number of these Bronze Age settlements, the &quot;motillas&quot;, were built over Chalcolithic settlements.

During the Iron Age II (La Tène culture), the territory occupied by the current provinces of Ciudad Real and Albacete had a larger influence from Punic-Phoenician and Greek colonists, while the territory occupied by the current provinces of Toledo, Guadalajara and Cuenca was more influenced by the substrate of the earlier Atlantic Bronze, helping to line up the diffuse separation of two large groups of pre-Roman peoples (&quot;Iberi&quot; and &quot;Celtiberi&quot;).

Iberian-related peoples dwelling the southern rim of the inner plateau such as the Oretani and Contestani were organised in tribes ruled by a kinglet or chieftain, each one controlling a number of settlements. The main cog of the Iberian form of settlement was the &quot;oppidum&quot;. From the 7th century BC onward, the Celtiberian settlements were characterised instead by the somewhat smaller &quot;castros&quot;.

;Antiquity
In the 2nd century BC, by the time of the advent of the Roman conquest wars, the first actual cities had begun to grow in the inner plateau. The Roman conquest brought substantial transformations to the Carpetani urban settlements, including the social division between slaves and freemen, the monetary economy, the fostering of manufacture and trade or the new Roman acculturation.

The territory of the current region was mining-rich in Antiquity, with mentions in classical sources to the mining of cinnabar from , silver, gold and other minerals such as selenite from Segobriga and the &quot;laminitana&quot; sharpening stone.

;Middle Ages history

Built from scratch on state initiative, the founding of the city of Reccopolis by Visigoths in the late 6th century was a singular development in the context of the European Early Middle Ages.

Following the 8th century Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, just after the 741 Berber Revolt, the so-called Middle March of Al-Andalus (&quot;al-Ťāğr al-Awsat&quot;) was created as territorial sub-division, existing for the rest of the ensuing emiral and caliphal period of Al-Andalus. During this era, the Middle March had eminently a military nature, both shielding the core of Al-Andalus from the raids of the Northern Christian polities as well as serving as staging ground for Muslim offensive campaigns against the former. Berber clans such as the Masmuda Banu-Salim (linked to the founders of Guadalajara) or the Hawwara Banu Zennun (based in the ) had an important role in the Muslim settlement of parts of the Middle March. The city of Toledo stood distinctly unruly towards the Cordobese authorities, and remained a major city of al-Andalus, preserving quite of its former importance and hosting a leading cultural centre that lasted even after the Christian conquest.

As consequence of the fitna of al-Andalus in the early 11th century, an independent polity with its center in Toledo (the Taifa of Toledo), emerged, roughly occupying the territory of the current-day provinces of Toledo, Ciudad Real, Guadalajara and Cuenca (as well as that of Madrid),

Following the Christian conquest of Toledo in 1085, the ensuing unsuccessful attempts by North-African Almoravids and Almohads to take the city turned the territory of the inner plateau south of the Tagus subject to extreme warfare for about a century and a half. The military insecurity south of the Tagus constrained the colonisation process undertaken by the new Castilian rulers. This underpinned the features of a sparse population in the region; as a result, ranching became a mainstay of the economy, which later led to the leading role of the military orders. The latter controlled over 20,000 km2 in the region of &quot;La Mancha&quot;, managed from just 25 castles. The weak Christian grip over the territory collapsed after their crushing defeat from the Almohads in Alarcos (1195). Christian control south of the Tagus would only start to consolidate after the 1212 battle of Las Navas. The weak settlement and insecurity also allowed for countryside banditry (the so-called &quot;golfines&quot;) in the area of the Montes de Toledo until its progressive quelling, already effective by the late 13th century. By that time, rural beekeepers self-organised to repel the predatory practices in the by the golfines, whose presence in the Montes de Toledo was further obliterated by the creation of the so-called &quot;hermandades viejas&quot; by councils at Toledo, Talavera or Villa Real in the dawn of the 14th century.

Despite a poorly representative degree of permeability, urban oligarchies in the current-day region during the Late Middle Ages were largely perpetuated by means of lineage, through inheritance and marriage. Following the ascension of the Trastámaras, the territory of the current-day province of Toledo underwent a process of seigneuralization, and a number of non-religious lordships were progressively created in the area. The 15th century also brought a growing importance of the political elites belonging to towns of the southern meseta in the affairs of the Crown of Castile relative to the prior uncontested preponderance of those elites from towns north of the Sistema Central.

;Modern history

Throughout the 18th century, following the War of Spanish Succession, the Spanish Bourbon monarchs sought to equilibrate the commercial balance with the exterior carrying out an economic policy that tried to foster industrial capacity through economic interventionism. The State shall either stimulate the capacity of private capital or simply provide the capital itself. Examples of royal manufactures created in the 18th century included the Real Fábrica de Paños in Guadalajara, the in Talavera de la Reina, or the in Brihuega.

The current provincial configuration roughly dates from the 1833 division by Javier de Burgos, establishing the outline of the modern provinces of Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara and Toledo, bar relatively minor later adjustments. Albacete was part, together with Murcia of a wider region, whereas Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara, and Toledo formed a region together with the Province of Madrid, &quot;New Castile&quot;. The justice administration stood in between the national and provincial levels of government (also unaligned with the purported regional classification insofar Albacete is concerned), with the &quot;audiencia&quot; of Albacete managing the provinces of Albacete, Cuenca and Ciudad Real, and the &quot;audiencia&quot; of Madrid managing the provinces of Toledo and Guadalajara (and that of Madrid).

The aforementioned modifications to the 1833 division include the party of Villena (lost by Albacete to Alicante in 1836), Requena (lost by Cuenca to Valencia in 1851), Villarrobledo (lost by Ciudad Real to Albacete ) or Valdeavero (lost by Guadalajara to Madrid in 1850). The provincial government institution was the &quot;provincial deputation&quot;.

The agrarian capitalism favoured by the bourgeoisie in the 19th century enshrined an economy based on cereal commodities and the primary sector, favouring the leveling of the reduced industrial activity—chiefly textile—in the territory corresponding to the current-day region, whereas mining output—with sites such of the mercury deposits in Almadén or the coal deposits in Puertollano—remained below potential. A silver rush broke out in the mining district around Hiendelaencina after 1844. Large-scale mining of lead and zinc in San Quintín (province of Ciudad Real) ensued in between 1884 and 1934. The arrival of railway transport in the mid 19th-century subordinated the interests of the provinces to those of Madrid and the Levante, although it fostered the development of some urban centres such as those of Alcázar de San Juan, Manzanares and Albacete. The five provinces lost relative demographic weight relative to the national total over the course of the century.

The territory of the current-day region was singularly affected by the &quot;desamortizaciones&quot;, particularly those of Mendizábal and Madoz. From 1836 to 1924 of land were auctioned (1,100,000 hectares of municipal properties and the rest church&#x27;s property). They were purchased by the political and economic elites of the country.

Seeking to curb immigration to the Spanish capital, the so-called Madrid Decongestion Plan of 1959 created planned industrial estates in Alcázar de San Juan, Manzanares, Guadalajara, and Toledo. The plan did not yield the expected results as Madrid kept growing and the industrial zones eventually stagnated.

=== Regionhood ===
Under the auspices of the 1978 Constitution, a decree-law was issued on 15 November 1978, establishing the conditions of the &quot;pre-autonomous regime&quot; of the &quot;Castilian-Manchegan region&quot;. A joint assembly of legislators and provincial deputies of the provinces of Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara, Toledo was established in Manzanares in 1981 to draft the early sketch of the regional statute. On 17 June 1982, the Congress of Deputies approved the final text of the regional statute (an organic law), which was later published on 16 August 1982, giving birth to the autonomous community of &quot;Castilla-La Mancha&quot;. The constituent process of the autonomous community was sealed with the election of the first regional legislature in May 1983 and the ensuing investiture of José Bono as regional president. By December 1983 still less than half of citizens actually knew the autonomous community they belonged to.

Since its opening in 1979 the Tagus-Segura Water Transfer has caused a severe social-economic impact on the region, with the water resources available in the Tagus headwaters decreasing by about a 47.5% after 1980.

==Regional divisions==




Castilla–La Mancha is divided into 5 provinces named after their capital cities. The following category includes:
* Albacete
* Ciudad Real
* Cuenca
* Guadalajara
* Toledo

According to the official data of the INE, Castilla–La Mancha consists of 919 municipalities, which amount to 11.3 percent of all the municipalities in Spain. 496 of these have less than 500 inhabitants, 231 have between 501 and 2,000 inhabitants, 157 between 2,000 and 10,000 inhabitants, and only 35 have more than 10,000 inhabitants. The municipalities in the north are small and numerous, while in the south they are larger and fewer. This reflects different histories of how these sub-regions were repopulated during the &quot;Reconquista&quot;. 
== Official symbols ==
The Organic Law 9/1982 (August 10, 1982), which is the Statute of Autonomy of Castilla–La Mancha established the flag of Castilla–La Mancha and the law 1/1983 (30 June 1983) established the coat of arms.

=== Flag ===
Seven different designs for a flag were proposed during the era of the &quot;pre-autonomous&quot; region. The selected design was that of heraldist Ramón José Maldonado. This was made official in Article 5 of the Statute of Autonomy:
* One. The flag of the region consists of a rectangle divided vertically into two equal squares: the first, together with the mast, crimson red with a castle of Or masoned in sable and port and windows of azure; the second, white.
* Two. The flag of the region will fly at regional, provincial, or municipal public buildings, and will appear next to the Spanish flag, which will be displayed in the preeminent place; historic territories [provinces] may also be represented.

=== Coat of arms ===

The coat of arms of Castilla–La Mancha is based on the flag of the region, and not the other way around, as is more typical in heraldry. Article 1 of the law 1/1983 describes it as follows:

:The coat of arms of the Communities of Castilla–La Mancha is party per pale. On the dexter [the statute literally says &quot;On the first quarter&quot;], on a field gules a castle Or, embattled, port and windows of azure and masoned sable. On the sinister [the statute literally says &quot;The second quarter&quot;], a field argent. On the crest, a royal crown enclosed, which is a circle of Or crimped with precious gems, composed of eight finials, of &quot;Acanthus mollis&quot;, five visible, topped by pearls and whose leaves emerge from diadems, which converge in a globe of azure or blue, with a semimeridian and the equator Or topped by a cross Or. The crown lined with gules or red.

Some institutions of the region have adopted this coat of arms as part of their own emblem, among these the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha, the Consultative Council and the University of Castilla–La Mancha.

=== Anthem ===
Although Article 5 of the Statute of Autonomy indicates that the region will have its own anthem, after more than 25 years no such anthem has been adopted. Among the proposed anthems have been the &quot;Canción del Sembrador&quot; (&quot;Song of the Sower&quot;) from the zarzuela &quot;La rosa del azafrán&quot; by Jacinto Guerrero, the &quot;Canto a la Mancha&quot; (&quot;Song of La Mancha&quot;) by Tomás Barrera, and many others, such as one presented by a group of citizens from Villarrobledo with the title &quot;Patria sin fin&quot; (&quot;Fatherland without end&quot;).

== Government and administration ==
Article 8 of the Statute of Autonomy states that the powers of the region are exercised through the Junta of Communities of Castilla–La Mancha (&quot;Junta de Comunidades de Castilla–La Mancha&quot;). Organs of the Junta are the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha, the President of the Junta and the Council of Government.

=== Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha ===
The Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha represent the popular will through 33 deputies elected by universal adult suffrage through the secret ballot. They are elected for a term of four years under a proportional system intended to guarantee representation to the various territorial zones of Castilla–La Mancha. The electoral constituency is at the level of each province, with provinces being assigned the following number of deputies as of 2023: Albacete, 7; Ciudad Real, 7; Cuenca, 5; Guadalajara, 5; and Toledo, 9. Article 10 of the Statute of Autonomy states that elections will be convoked by the President of the Junta of Communities, following the General Electoral Regime (&quot;Régimen Electoral General&quot;), on the fourth Sunday in May every four years. This stands in contrast to the autonomous communities of the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, Andalusia and the Valencian Community where the president has the power to convoke elections at any time.

Since the Spanish regional elections of 2023, the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha has consisted of 17 deputies from social democratic PSOE, 12 from conservative People&#x27;s Party and 4 from far right Vox. The Cortes sits in the former Franciscan convent in Toledo, the &quot;Edificio de San Gil&quot; (&quot;San Gil building&quot;).

=== Council of Government ===
The Council of Government is the collegial executive organ of the region. It directs regional political and administrative action, exercises an executive function and regulatory powers under the Spanish Constitution of 1978, the Statute of Autonomy, and the laws of the nation and region. The Council of Government consists of the president, vice presidents (if any) and the Councilors.

=== President of the Junta ===

The President of the Junta directs the Council of Government and coordinates the functions of its members. The president is elected by the Cortes from among its members, then formally named by the monarch of Spain. The president&#x27;s official residence is the Palace of Fuensalida in Toledo.

== Demography ==
Large parts of the region are experiencing a demographic decline. In contrast, besides the provincial capitals, two specific areas bordering the Madrid region associated to the Madrid metropolitan area have experienced a population growth well above the national average: La Sagra (around the A-42 highway) and the Henares Corridor (around the A-2). Overall, as of 2016, the NUTS-2 region of Castilla–La Mancha featured an average index of demographic vulnerability of 30, similar to those of the European regions of Upper Palatinate (Germany), Styria (Austria), Catalonia (Spain), Overijssel (Netherlands) and Campania (Italy).

===Number of inhabitants===
According to the official 11 January 2008 data of the INE Castilla–La Mancha has 2,043,100 inhabitants in its five provinces. Despite being the third largest of Spains communities by surface area (after Castilla y León and Andalusia), it is only the ninth most populous. Castilla–La Mancha has just 4.4 percent of Spain&#x27;s population.

===Population density===
With an average population density of , Castilla–La Mancha has the least dense population in all of Spain: the national average is . Industrialized zones such as the Henares Corridor (along the river Henares, a tributary of the Jarama) with a density of , the comarca of la Sagra or the industrial zone of Sonseca are dramatically more dense than the region as a whole.

===Composition of population by age and sex===
The population pyramid of Castilla–La Mancha is typical for a developed region, with the central zone wider than the base or the upper zone. The population between 16 and 44 years of age represents about 44 percent, from 45 to 64 about 21.3 percent, with those 15 and under constituting 15 percent and those over 65, 18 percent. These data show the progressive aging of the &quot;castellanomanchego&quot; population.

The region has about 9,000 more males than females; in percentage terms, 50.3 percent versus 49.7 percent. This is opposite to Spain as a whole, where women constitute 50.8 percent of the population.

===Birth rate, death rate, life expectancy===
According to 2006 INE numbers, the birth rate in Castilla–La Mancha is 10.21 per thousand inhabitants, lower than the national average of 10.92 per thousand. The death rate is 8.83 per thousand inhabitants, higher than the national average of 8.42 per thousand.

Life expectancy at birth is one of the highest in Spain: 83.67 years for women and 77.99 years for men.

=== Foreign population ===

As of 2018, the region had a foreign population of 163,820. Most of the foreigners had Romanian or Moroccan citizenship.

=== Urban areas ===
The 2020 report on urban areas in Spain published by the Ministry of Transports, Mobility and Urban Agenda identifies among the urban areas in the region (with population data referring to 2019) those of Albacete (173,329), Guadalajara (161,683), Toledo (123,509), Talavera de la Reina (94,028), Ciudad Real (90,114), Cuenca (54,690) and Puertollano (47,035).

==Economy==

Castilla–La Mancha generates a GDP of €33,077,484,000, 3.4 percent of the Spanish GDP, placing it ninth among the 19 Spanish autonomous communities. GDP has been roughly 3.4 percent of the national GDP since at least 2000. A per capita GDP of €17,339 places Castilla–La Mancha 17th among the 19 communities, with only Andalusia and Extremadura having lower per capita GDP; the national average is €22,152. Nonetheless, in the early to mid-1990s, Sonseca in the province of Toledo several times had the highest per capita income in Spain.

As of 2017, the regional gross value added structure is as follows: 

According to the statistics of the INE&#x27;s Encuesta de Población Activa for the first trimester of 2007, the active work force of Castilla–La Mancha numbered 896,513 persons, of whom 827,113 were employed and 69,900 unemployed, giving a workforce density of 55.5 percent of the population and an unemployment rate of 7.7 percent.

=== Agriculture and husbandry ===
Agriculture and husbandry, still the foundation of the local economy, constitutes 11.6 percent of regional GDP, and employs 9.9 percent of the active workforce.

Fifty-two percent of the soil of Castilla–La Mancha is considered &quot;dry&quot;. Agricultural activities have historically been based on the cultivation of wheat (37.0 percent), grapes (17.2 percent) and olives (6.6 percent). Castilla–La Mancha has some of the most extensive vineyards in Europe, nearly . The vineyards are predominantly, but by no means exclusively, in the west and southwest of La Mancha. In 2005 the region produced of grapes, constituting 53.4 percent of Spain&#x27;s national production. After grapes, the next most important agricultural product is barley, , 25.0 percent of the national total.

As of 2014, the region (primarily areas in the provinces of Cuenca and Albacete) was by far the largest producer of garlic in Spain, which was in turn the largest producer country in Europe. Black truffle is produced in areas of the provinces of Guadalajara, Cuenca and Albacete. The overwhelming majority of the saffron produced in Spain (97%) originates from the region.

The region concentrates the 81% of pistachio-cultivated area in the country, which increased fortyfold in a decade becoming the first European producer and fifth worldwide in the early 2020s.

In terms of agricultural productivity and income, since Spain&#x27;s incorporation into the European Union (EU) the primary sector of the regional economy has evolved dynamically. Among the reasons for this are growth rates higher than the national average, as well as increased capitalization fostering specialization and modernization, including the integration an externalization of the sector, whereby activities previously performed on the farm are now performed elsewhere. These changes have been fostered by the regional articulation of the EU&#x27;s Common Agricultural Policy. Since 1986, subsidies have played a significant role in this sector.

Animal husbandry plays a lesser, but not negiglible, role in the regional economy. 2005 statistics show 3,430,501 head of sheep, 1,602,576 pigs, 405,778 goats and 309,672 cattle; these last produce of milk each year.

Apiculture (bee-keeping) is another significant part of the primary sector output, with 190,989 hives as of 4 October 2017.
=== Industry and construction ===
Traditionally, Castilla–La Mancha has had little industrial production, due to several factors among which are low population density and a shortage of qualified workers. However, since Spain&#x27;s incorporation into the EU, there has been much progress. Industry has been growing as a sector of the regional economy at a faster pace than nationally. July 2006 figures show the region as third among the autonomous communities in the rate of growth of the industrial sector. Regional industrial GDP grew 2.8 percent in 2000–2005, compared to 1 percent nationally for the same period.

The greatest obstacles to industrial growth in the region have been:
* Lack of a dense business fabric.
* Undersized industrial enterprises.
* Little specialization of labor.
* Little investment in R &amp; D.
* Poor infrastructure with respect to services to enterprises.
* Little export orientation.
* Inadequate marketing channels and distribution for regional products.

The principal industrial areas within the region are Sonseca and its comarca, the Henares Corridor, Puertollano, Talavera de la Reina, La Sagra y Almansa, as well as all of the provincial capitals.

As throughout Spain in recent decades, the construction sector is one of the strongest. It employs 15.6 percent of the work force and produces 10.1 percent of regional GDP. It is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy: growth in 2006 was 13.6 percent. Most of the construction sector, is housing, including a new city of 30,000 inhabitants, Ciudad Valdeluz in Yebes, Guadalajara; 13,000 dwellings in Seseña, Toledo and the Reino de Don Quijote complex in the province of Ciudad Real, with 9,000 dwellings and 4,000 hotel beds.

As of 2019, the regional defence industry ranks third in Spain after those of Madrid and Andalusia, with a 5.8% share of sales. The bulk of the defence industry lies in cities such as Illescas, Toledo, Cedillo, Valdepeñas, Puertollano, Ciudad Real or Albacete. The Airbus Group is present in Illescas since 1992 and in Albacete (Airbus Helicopters) since 2005.

=== Energy ===

Although wind energy and solar energy have been playing increasingly important roles in Castilla–La Mancha, the majority of the energy generated in the region comes from the region&#x27;s large thermal power stations: the Elcogas Thermal Power Station (owned by Elcogas) and Puertollano Thermal Power Station (owned by E.ON) in Puertollano as well as the Aceca Thermal Power Station in Villaseca de la Sagra (owned by Iberdrola and Unión Fenosa).

Castilla–La Mancha is also the home of the Trillo Nuclear Power Plant near Trillo, Guadalajara.

Existing solar thermal power plants (all using a parabolic trough collector) in the region include Manchasol-1 and Manchasol-2 in Alcázar de San Juan (49.9 and 50 MW respectively), Helios 1 and Helios 2 in Puerto Lápice (50 MW each), Ibersol Ciudad Real in Puertollano (50 MW).

Regarding photovoltaic power plants, Picón I, Picón II and Picón III (50 MW each), located in Porzuna, were put into operation in 2019.

=== Mining ===
The region is rich in mineral resources, particularly the south, and they have been exploited since Antiquity.

As of 2018, with 270 active mining sites (only one of them an underground mine), most of the extractive sector is dedicated to aggregates, clays, plasters and other mineral products, accounting for a 10.15% of active sites in Spain.

Recent mining projects brought forward by the regional government in the province of Ciudad Real, rich in a number of strategic minerals, include those of tungsten (in between Almodóvar del Campo and Abenójar), phosphates (in Fontanarejo), and titanium and zirconium (in between Puebla de Don Rodrigo and Arroba de los Montes), but their final authorisations pend on satisfactory environmental impact statements, and they have also met the opposition from environmental organisations.

=== Service sector ===

The majority of the regional workforce—55.5 percent—is employed in the service sector, generating 49.8 percent of regional GDP, according to Economic and Social Council of Castilla–La Mancha (&quot;Consejo Económico y Social de Castilla–La Mancha&quot;, CES) data for 2006. Although a large sector of the regional economy, it is small by national standards: 67.2 percent of employment in Spain is in the service sector. Counted in the service sector are commerce, tourism, hospitality, finance, public administration, and administration of other services related to culture and leisure.

The Madrid&#x27;s urban decongestion has favoured the development of logistics businesses and platforms in Azuqueca de Henares and Illescas, which neighbor the Madrid region.

In the area of tourism, there has been a great deal of growth, with Castilla–La Mancha becoming in recent decades one of the principal tourist destinations in the Spanish interior. During 2006 the region had more than 2 million tourists (3 percent more than the previous year) for a total of 3,500,000 overnight hotel stays. Rural tourism increased 14 percent in overnight stays in a single year. From 2000 to 2005 the number of hotel beds increased 26.4 percent to 17,245 beds in 254 hotels. In the same period, the number of &quot;casas rurales&quot; (for farm stays) increased 148 percent to 837 and the number of beds in such facilities 175 percent to 5,751.

== Health ==

The Servicio de Salud de Castilla–La Mancha (SESCAM, &quot;Health Service of Castilla–La Mancha&quot;), part of the Consejería de Salud y Bienestar Social (&quot;Council of Health and Social Welfare&quot;) is the entity in charge of health in Castilla–La Mancha. It is an integral part of Spain&#x27;s National Health System, based on universal coverage, equal access, and public financing.

For the purposes of healthcare provision, the region is divided in 8 health areas (Albacete, la Mancha Centro, Guadalajara, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Talavera de la Reina, Toledo, and Puertollano). Those are further subdivided in basic health zones.

== Education ==

The Junta of Castilla–La Mancha assumed responsibility for education in the autonomous community as of January 1, 2000, directly managing over 1,000 schools, with 22,000 teachers and 318,000 students. In the 2006–2007 school year, the region had 324,904 students below the university level, of whom 17.7 percent were in private schools. In that same year, the region had 1,037 schools and 30,172 schoolteachers; 15.2 percent of the schools were private.

The decentralized University of Castilla–La Mancha was formally established in 1982 and has operated since 1985.
There are four main campuses, one each at Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca and Toledo, with classes also offered in Almadén, Talavera de la Reina and Puertollano. The university offers 54 degree programs (&quot;titulaciones&quot;). The province of Guadalajara stands outside the regional university, with its own University of Alcalá offering degrees in education, business, tourism, technical architecture, and nursing. The National University of Distance Education also offers services in the region through five affiliated centers, one in each province: Albacete (with an extension in Almansa), Valdepeñas, Cuenca, Guadalajara, and Talavera de la Reina. Finally, the Menéndez Pelayo International University has a location in Cuenca.

In the 2005–06 school year, the region had 30,632 students enrolled at universities, down 1.0 percent from the previous year.

Historically, the region has had other universities, but these no longer exist. The present University of Castilla–La Mancha uses one of the buildings of the Royal University of Toledo (1485–1807). Other former universities in the region were the Royal and Pontifical University of Our Lady of Rosario in Almagro (1550–1807) and the University of San Antonio de Porta Coeli in Sigüenza founded in the 15th century by Cardinal Pedro González de Mendoza and, like the others, closed in the Napoleonic era.

== Transportation ==

=== Highways ===
Castilla–La Mancha has the most kilometers of &quot;autopistas&quot; (a type of limited access highway) and &quot;autovías&quot; dual carriageways, with a total of . The most heavily trafficked of these are the radial routes surrounding Madrid and the routes in and out of the city, but there are also routes within Castilla–La Mancha, and national and international routes that pass through the province, including highways in the International E-road network.

The regional government put into action a &quot;Plan Regional de Autovías&quot; with the objective that all municipalities with 10,000 or more inhabitants would be connected to an &quot;autovía&quot;. If it is completed, 96 percent of the region&#x27;s population will live within 15 minutes of a high-capacity road. Among the developed projects of this plan are:
* Autovía de los Viñedos, connecting Toledo and Tomelloso (completely in service).
* Autovía de la Sagra, connecting the Autovía A-5 with the Autovía A-4 (Tranches I and II under way, duplication of highway CM-4001 in the tendering of works phase).
* Autovía del IV Centenario, departs Ciudad Real to meet with the future Autovía Linares-Albacete (A-32), passing through Valdepeñas (first phase partially under way, second currently being studied).
* Autovía del Júcar, , will connect Albacete to Cuenca (in project).
* Autovía de la Alcarria: although initially contemplated in the Plan Regional de Autovías, the Ministry of Development has taken over the work. It will connect the Autovía del Este (Autovía A-4) with the Autovía del Nordeste (Autovía A-2) (currently being studied).

The &quot;red autonómica&quot;—the road network of the autonomous community—currently extends , of which correspond to the basic network, to the comarcal networks and to local networks.

=== Railways ===
Renfe, Spain&#x27;s state-owned railway operator operates numerous trains throughout Castilla–La Mancha.

====Long distance====
Numerous long-distance rail lines (&quot;líneas de largo recorrido&quot;) pass through Castilla–La Mancha, most of them radiating out of Madrid. Some of these are high-velocity trains (Alta Velocidad Española AVE):

====Local trains====
Two local commuter rail lines out of Madrid (&quot;Cercanías Madrid&quot;) pass through Castilla–La Mancha. The C-2 line stops in Azuqueca de Henares in the province of Guadalajara and in the city of Guadalajara itself. The C-3 to Aranjuez used to stop at Seseña, but service to that station was discontinued in April 2007.

==== Airports ====
Air transport is marginal in the region. Castilla–La Mancha has two airports, the Albacete Airport (no cargo transport and with an insignificant civilian use) and the Ciudad Real Central Airport, which was affected by the 2008 crisis and closed in 2012, although efforts have been pursued to reactivate the latter. Relatively close airports outside the region include those in Madrid, Valencia and Alicante.

== Culture ==
=== Heritage protection ===

The region hosts several World Heritage Sites: Toledo (since 1986), Cuenca (since 1996) and Almadén (together with the Slovenian town of Idrija under the &quot;Heritage of Mercury. Almadén and Idrija&quot; joint site) since 2012.

As of 2020, the region features 644 &quot;bienes de interés cultural&quot; (BIC) across the 5 provinces: Albacete (92), Ciudad Real (108), Cuenca (99), Guadalajara (104) and Toledo (238) plus another 3 transcending the provincial borders.

The regional legislation in force concerning the cultural heritage dates from 2013. Restrictions on the modification of historical buildings or the use of metal detectors were introduced then.

<text>Guadalajara ( , ) is a city and municipality in Spain, located in the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha. It is the capital of the Province of Guadalajara.

Lying on the central part of the Iberian Peninsula at roughly metres above sea level, the city straddles the Henares River. it has a population of 86,222 which makes it the region&#x27;s second most populated municipality.

== History ==
=== Alleged identification with Arriaca ===

A Roman town called &quot;Arriaca&quot;, possibly founded by a pre-Roman culture, is suggested to have been located in that region. There is however no archeological proof of its existence, only references in texts such as the &quot;Ruta Antonina&quot;, which describe it as being in the hands of the Carpetani when encountered by the Romans. The city, as &quot;Caracca&quot;, was incorporated into the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis. The city was on the high road from Emerita (modern Mérida) to Caesaraugusta (modern Zaragoza), 22 M. P. northeast of Complutum (modern Alcalá de Henares).

=== Early Middle Ages ===

The founding of Guadalajara, dating from the Islamic period, is attributed to a person named &quot;Faraŷ&quot;. It was officially known as Madīnat al-Faraŷ in the 9th and 10th centuries. The town was later known as Wādī Al-Ḥijāra (), possibly meaning &quot;Valley of Stones&quot; (as in river gravel); in theory it may be a literal translation of the Iberian name &quot;Arriaca&quot;. It has also been proposed that &quot;Ḥajāra&quot; should not be understood as &#x27;stones&#x27;/&#x27;gravel&#x27;, but in the sense of &#x27;castles&#x27; or &#x27;fortified rocks&#x27;.

Wādī Al-Ḥijāra and its surroundings were part of the Middle March of Al-Andalus, controlled by the Masmuda Berber clan of the Banū Sālim who governed on behalf of the Umayyad rulers of Córdoba. During the Muslim period an &quot;alcázar&quot; (fortress) was built by the mid-9th century, as well as the Bridge over the Henares (its construction has been tentatively dated by the late 10th century or early 11th century). Walls enclosing the city were also built by then. In 920, the Banū Sālim were routed from Wādī Al-Ḥijāra (reportedly because the local population resented their rule) by Abd al-Rahman III, who attempted to directly rule the territory.

The city was part of the territory annexed by Alfonso VI of León and Castile in the 1085 conquest of the Taifa of Toledo, with Wādī Al-Ḥijāra surrendering and offering no resistance. Tradition claims however that a contingent led by Álvar Fáñez de Minaya (one of the lieutenants of El Cid) seized the city on 24 June, at night.

The area was repopulated with people from the North (Castilians from the mountains and Merindades, Basques and Navarreses mainly).

Alfonso VII granted Guadalajara its first &quot;fuero&quot; on 3 May 1133. This charter progressively incorporated several amendments. The second &quot;fuero&quot;, probably conceived during the reign of Alfonso VIII, was anyway confirmed by Ferdinand III on 26 May 1219 and 13 April 1251.

For most of its history, up until the 20th century, Guadalajara&#x27;s water supply came from two sources: the Henares river and the springs located along the cornice formed by the border of the limestone moors of La Alcarria. Control over the scarce water resources was fought over and it became a symbol of social status for the local nobility during the Late Middle Ages.

During the reign of Alfonso X of Castile (r. 1253-1284), the protection of the king allowed the city to develop its economy by protecting merchants and allowing markets.

=== Rule of the Mendozas ===
Traditionally a &quot;&quot; (&#x27;royal demesne&#x27;) town, with a vote in the Cortes of Castile, the town came under the influence of the powerful Mendoza family until well into the Early Modern period. Despite the former meddling that underpinned the political control of the city, Guadalajara was not enshrined as formal seigneurial jurisdiction of the Mendozas in a legal sense. The family included Íñigo López de Mendoza, also known as Marqués de Santillana (1398–1458), and Pedro González de Mendoza (1428–1495), Great Cardinal of Spain and adviser of the Catholic Monarchs.

The Mendoza family held the title of Dukes and Duchesses of El Infantado from 1475. On 25 March 1460, Henry IV granted Guadalajara the status of &#x27;City&#x27;. In this period, the Mendoza Family ordered the building of El Palacio del Infantado as their main residence. It was completed in the early 1480s and it is considered by many the oldest surviving building built in a pure Renaissance style outside Italy.

The city&#x27;s economy prospered thanks to the development of a specialised artisanate and a bustling trade.

In the early 16th century, the city was one of the main focal points of the &quot;iluminismo&quot; (or &quot;alumbrados&quot;) in the Kingdom of Toledo, linked to heterodox religious figures such as Isabel de la Cruz and María de Cazalla.

In the context of the Revolt of the Comuneros across the Crown of Castile, the &quot;comunero&quot; rebels in Guadalajara, as early as 5 June 1520, asked the Duke of the Infantado, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, to join the anti-imperial revolt. The demonstrators lit the houses of the &quot;procurators&quot; who went to the Cortes of La Coruña to vote in favour of the taxes and obligations levied by Emperor Charles V. The Duke of Infantado played a cautious waiting game to see which side would win, finally choosing to endorse the Emperor in 1521. He ordered the beheading of the local leaders of the insurgency and the deportation of his own son and successor Íñigo López de Mendoza, who had leaned towards the &quot;comunero&quot; cause.

By 1591, the city had a population of 6,754.

=== Crisis ===

The Crisis of the 17th century took a heavy toll in many Castilian cities, and particularly in Guadalajara. The city was affected by the 1610 expulsion of the moriscos both in terms of the net demographic loss (10% of the population) as well as by their critical weight in key sectors of the local economy such as the artisanate and trade. Many palaces were left forsaken. The Mendozas left the city for good in 1657.

During the War of the Spanish Succession, in the early 18th century, Guadalajara was sacked. Ravaged by the &quot;Austracist&quot; army, a largely ruined Guadalajara hit then its lowest demographic point, with only around 2,200 inhabitants. Without external assistance the city may have simply ceased to exist. The 20,000,000 &quot;maravedies&quot; indebted to the Royal Treasury were forgiven in 1716. Philip V ordered the establishment of the Real Fábrica de Paños (Royal Factory of Clothes), which was opened in the city in 1719 in the Palacio del Marqués de Montesclaros, critically helping the city to move on from the calamitous situation it found itself.

=== Contemporary times ===
The 19th century started with two major setbacks: the damages caused by the Peninsular War (1808–1814) and the closing of the Real Fábrica de Paños in 1822. In 1808, Guadalajara was taken by the French Army led by General Hugo and the city was destroyed. During the war, the 14 convents in the city were abandoned and turned into barracks, paving the way for the future processes of &quot;desamortización&quot;, most decisively in between 1833 and 1843.

The &quot;desamortización&quot; entailed the change of use of religious buildings (turned to hospitals, high schools, military workshops), the demolition of some convents to widen street space and to erect new residential areas, and the reduction of the share of church properties in the estate structure.

Both the declaration of Guadalajara as provincial capital and the parallel installment of the Academy of Military Engineers in the city in 1833, fostered some slow growth.

Railway transport arrived to the city with the opening of the Madrid–Guadalajara stretch of the Madrid–Zaragoza line (built by the , MZA) on 3 May 1859. Conversely, the Guadalajara–Jadraque stretch to the northeast was opened on 5 October 1860.

The municipality had a population of 12,662 in 1900, the most populated municipality in the province, followed by Sigüenza (10,581). The 20th century saw the construction of the current water supply system bringing the waters of the Sorbe to the city.

On 21 July 1936, following the general coup d&#x27;état of 18 July that sparked the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), the conspiring officers in the city (joined by the forces of public order and some civilians, amounting to an overall force of roughly 800) seized control of the city. The next day, the Republican Government in Madrid sent Ildefonso Puigdendolas to quell the rebellion and secure the city. The rebels were pushed in retreat to the &quot;Cuartel de Aerostación&quot;, where they surrendered. The militias executed roughly one hundred of them.

The city was the target of several aerial bombing attacks by the Francoists; the most famous, in December 1936, struck the Palacio del Infantado.
On 8 March 1937, the four divisions of the Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie (CTV), attacked Republican positions outside Guadalajara as a supporting diversionary attack supporting the Nationalist Jarama Offensive began at the beginning of February. After four days of a slow, cautious advance during rainy weather, the tanks started attacking along paved roads and outran the air and anti-aircraft artillery support. Shortly thereafter, Republican airplanes in newly clear skies found the tanks and infantry in a traffic jam on the main road into Guadalajara. The Republican aircraft attacked and destroyed all the vehicles in the mechanized spearhead. The CTV retreated with casualties in the thousands. Ernest Hemingway labeled the attack &quot;Italian débâcle at Guadalajara.&quot; As a result of the victory, Republican forces enjoyed an increase in recruitment.

This defeat at Guadalajara had two long-standing effects. First, the Italian Army of the Mussolini dictatorship acquired a reputation for incompetence that lasted until the armistice of 1943. Second, some observing nations adopted a doctrine that ruled out tanks operating as an independent force but emphasized tying them tightly to large infantry formations.

The Civil War and the heavy fighting around the city caused significant damage. After two decades of slow rebuilding, Guadalajara was included in 1959 in the development plans for alleviating the congestion of Madrid&#x27;s industrial estates (&quot;El Plan de Descongestión Industrial de Madrid en Castilla-La Mancha&quot;). These plans attempted to move industrial and accompanying residential growth to the periphery, including in Guadalajara. Since then, Guadalajara has been one of the fast-growing Spanish cities.

Guadalajara absorbed the municipalities of Taracena, Valdenoches and Iriépal in 1969, Marchamalo in 1972 and Usanos in 1973. Later, in 1999, Marchamalo segregated from Guadalajara, becoming a standalone municipality again.

Nowadays, Guadalajara is involved in urban development plans that are quickly increasing the population of the city. New districts like Aguas Vivas (Live Waters) have been inaugurated.

Ciudad Valdeluz was planned to increase the number of inhabitants of Guadalajara by 30,000, creating a new city around the AVE Station (Spanish High-Speed Trains). The company investing in the construction of Ciudad Valdeluz went bankrupt. Fewer than 500 inhabitants decided to occupy their flats and the remaining infrastructure is slow degrading. The AVE trains are used by only 60 passengers a day.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Guadalajara is located in the central part of the Iberian Peninsula, in the southern half of the Inner Plateau.

Chosen as settlement on the basis of defensive purposes, the historic urban core of the city lies on a small elevation near the left-bank of the Henares River, also enclosed to the East and West by two small ditches corresponding to two watercourses, and San Antonio, respectively, forming a narrow and easily defendable space upon their confluence with the Henares.

The municipality spans across a total area of 235.49 km2.

=== Climate ===
Guadalajara enjoys a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot;) bordering on a mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with continental influences for being well inland at 700 meters above sea level. Summers are hot with relatively cool nights, while winters are cool with cold nights. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Guadalajara is on 12 January 2009. The highest temperature ever recorded is on 10 August 2012.

== Politics and administration ==
Guadalajara is a municipality, the basic level of local division in Spain. The Ayuntamiento is the body charged with the municipal government and administration. The Plenary of the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; is formed by 25 elected municipal councillors, who in turn invest the mayor. The last municipal election took place on 26 May 2019. Since June 2019, the current mayor is Alberto Rojo Blas (Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party).

== Demographics ==

=== Urban area ===

The 2020 report on urban areas in Spain published by the Ministry of Transports, Mobility and Urban Agenda identifies an urban area formed by the municipality of Guadalajara together with the neighbouring municipalities of Azuqueca de Henares, Alovera, Cabanillas del Campo, Marchamalo, Villanueva de la Torre and Chiloeches, with a population of 161,683 (2019).

== Architecture ==

; City proper
The bridge across the Henares river is Arab but built on Roman foundations. It has several historic buildings such as the Palacio del Infantado, as well as many churches, such as the church of San Ginés. Although Guadalajara is the biggest city in its diocese, the cathedral is located in the nearby town of Sigüenza. However, in Guadalajara, there is a &quot;co-cathedral&quot;, the church of Saint Mary, in Mudejar style. Very close to this church, is placed the chapel known as &quot;Capilla de Luis de Lucena&quot;, which has several fresco paintings on its walls and ceiling. The Church of los Remedios was declared &quot;Bien de Interés Cultural&quot; in 1924, and currently serves as the auditorium of the University of Alcalá. The Church of la Piedad was declared &quot;Bien de Interés Cultural&quot; in 1931.

Before the Civil War, Guadalajara was also known to be among the cities with most number of antique azulejos in the Iberian Peninsula housed in their buildings, since the city housed the largest collection of azulejos from Talavera de la Reina pottery; now almost all of those azulejos are lost.

; &quot;Pedanías&quot;
The small villages (&quot;pedanías&quot;) of Iriépal, Taracena, Usanos, and Valdenoches that belong to the municipality feature few monumental landmarks other than their humble rural churches. Thus, in Iriépal there is the Concepción church, constructed in the 16th century, which is known for its Mudéjar tower. In Taracena there is the 17th century Church of the Immaculate, in a very simple Renaissance style. In Usanos, there is the 13th-century Romanesque church of the Assumption, considerably remodeled in later periods and which features a crenelated tower.

Other types of monuments that are also noteworthy are the Iriépal laundry, work of 1910 in historicist style with funding from the Jose Santa María de Hita Foundation, and Iriépal (1858) and Valdenoches (1656) funds.

Throughout all the villages there are examples of Castilian mansions, quite modest compared to those in the cities. Of note also is Villaflores, a farming village built in 1887, designed by Ricardo Velázquez Bosco and commissioned to Maria Diega Desmaissières.

== Transport ==

Guadalajara is served by two railway stations:
* Guadalajara railway station, located in the city centre and part of the classical railway lines, e.g., connecting Chamartín to Portbou/Cerbère.

<text>Guadalajara ( ; ) is the capital and the most populous city of the western Mexican state of Jalisco, being the most densely populated municipality in Jalisco. According to the 2020 census, the city has a population of 1,385,629 people, making it the 8th most populous city in Mexico, while the Guadalajara metropolitan area has a population of 5,268,642 people, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in the country and the twenty-second largest metropolitan area in the Americas. Guadalajara has the second-highest population density in Mexico, with over 10,361 people per square kilometer. Within Mexico, Guadalajara is a center of business, arts and culture, technology and tourism; as well as the economic center of the Bajío region. It usually ranks among the 100 most productive and globally competitive cities in the world. It is home to numerous landmarks, including the Guadalajara Cathedral, the Degollado Theatre, the Templo Expiatorio, the UNESCO World Heritage site Hospicio Cabañas, and the San Juan de Dios Market—the largest indoor market in Latin America.

A settlement was established in the region of Guadalajara in early 1532 by , a Basque conquistador in the expedition of . The settlement was renamed and moved several times before assuming the name Guadalajara after the birthplace of Guzmán and ending up at its current location in the Atemajac Valley in 1542. On November 8, 1539, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V had granted a coat of arms and the title of city to the new town and established it as the capital of the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia, part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. After 1572, the Royal Audiencia of Guadalajara, previously subordinate to Mexico City, became the only authority in New Spain with autonomy over Nueva Galicia, owing to rapidly growing wealth in the kingdom following the discovery of silver. By the 18th century, Guadalajara had taken its place as Mexico&#x27;s second largest city, following mass colonial migrations in the 1720s and 1760s. During the Mexican War of Independence, independence leader established Mexico&#x27;s first revolutionary government in Guadalajara in 1810. The city flourished during the (1876–1911), with the advent of the industrial revolution, but its growth was hampered significantly during the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920). In 1929, the Cristero War ended within the confines of the city, when President proclaimed the . The city saw continuous growth throughout the rest of the 20th century, attaining a metro population of 1 million in the 1960s and surpassing 3 million in the 1990s.

Guadalajara is a Gamma+ global city, and one of Mexico&#x27;s most important cultural centers. It is home to numerous mainstays of Mexican culture, including Mariachi, Tequila, and Birria and hosts numerous notable events, including the Guadalajara International Film Festival, one of the most important film festival in Latin America, and the Guadalajara International Book Fair, the largest book fair in the Americas. The city was the American Capital of Culture in 2005 and has hosted numerous global events, including the 1970 FIFA World Cup, the 1986 FIFA World Cup, the 1st Ibero-American Summit in 1991, and the 2011 Pan American Games. The city is home to numerous universities and research institutions, including the University of Guadalajara and the , two of the highest-ranked universities in Mexico.

== Etymology ==

The conquistador named the city in honor of the conqueror of western Mexico, , who was born in , Spain, which is derived from Moorish Arabic (), which means &#x27;Valley of the Stones&#x27;, or &#x27;Fortress Valley&#x27;.

== History ==
=== Pre-Hispanic era ===

Unlike the surrounding areas, the central Atemajac Valley (where Guadalajara is located) contained no human settlements. To the east of the Atemajac Valley were the Tonallan and Tetlán peoples. At the extremes were the Zapopan, Atemajac, Zoquipan, Tesistan, Coyula, and Huentitán.

The historic city center encompasses what was once four population centers, as the villages of the Mezquitán, Analco, and Mexicaltzingo were annexed to the Atemajac site in 1669.

=== Foundation ===
Guadalajara was originally founded at three other sites before moving to its current location. The first colonial settlement in 1532 was in Mesa del Cerro, now known as Nochistlán, Zacatecas. This site was colonized by Cristóbal de Oñate as commissioned by Nuño de Guzmán, with the purpose of securing recent conquests and &quot;defending&quot; them from the &quot;still-hostile natives&quot;. This colonized settlement did not last long due to its lack of usable water sources. In 1533 it was moved to a site near Tonalá. Four years later, Guzmán ordered that the village be moved to Tlacotán. During this time, the Spanish king Charles I granted the city the coat of arms which it retains to this day.

During the Mixtón War (1540–1542), the Caxcan, Portecuex, and Zacateco peoples, fought back against colonizers under the command of Tenamaxtli. The war was initiated in response to the heinous treatment of indigenous peoples by Nuño de Guzmán, in particular the enslavement of captured natives. After multiple defeats, Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza took control of the Spanish campaign to suppress the revolt. The conflict ended after Mendoza made concessions such as freeing enslaved indigenous peoples and granting amnesty. The village of Guadalajara barely survived the war, and the villagers attributed their survival to the Archangel Michael, who remains the patron of the city to this day.

After the war, the city was moved once again—this time to a more defensible location. This final relocation would prove permanent. In 1542, records indicate that 126 people were living in Guadalajara. That same year, it was granted cityhood by the king of Spain. Guadalajara was officially founded on February 14, 1542, in the Atemajac Valley. The colonized settlement was named for Nuño de Guzmán&#x27;s Spanish hometown.

In 1559, royal and bishopric offices for the province of Nueva Galicia were moved from Compostela to Guadalajara and, in 1560, Guadalajara became the province&#x27;s new capital. Construction of the cathedral began in 1563. In 1575, religious orders such as the Augustinians and Dominicans arrived, eventually making the city a center for evangelization efforts.

While capital of the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia, the city&#x27;s inhabitants achieved a high standard of living, due to flourishing industry, agriculture, commerce, mining, and trade. The Guadalajara of the 16th century was a rather small and often overlooked community. It was mainly frequented by traveling merchants. Several epidemics drastically reduced the city&#x27;s indigenous population, leading to the construction of its first hospital in 1557.

Guadalajara&#x27;s economy during the 18th century was based on agriculture and the production of non-durable goods such as textiles, shoes and food products.

Despite epidemics, plagues, and earthquakes, Guadalajara would become one of the most important population centers in New Spain.
The city&#x27;s heyday attracted numerous architects, philosophers, lawyers, scientists, poets, writers, and speakers; Francisco Javier Clavijero and were among the most prominent. In 1771, Bishop Fray Antonio Alcalde arrived in the city and founded the Civil Hospital and the University of Guadalajara. In 1791, the University of Guadalajara was established. The dedication was held in 1792 at the site of the old Santo Tomas College. While the institution was founded during the 18th century, it would not be fully developed until the 20th century, starting in 1925. In 1794, the , or simply the Hospital de Belén, was opened.

In 1793, Mariano Valdés Téllez Giron ran the city&#x27;s first printing press, whose first publication was a funeral eulogy for Fray Antonio Alcalde.

=== Independence ===
Guadalajara remained the capital of Nueva Galicia with some modifications until the Mexican War of Independence. Miguel Hidalgo entered San Pedro (now Tlaquepaque) on November 25, 1810, and the next day he was greeted effusively in Guadalajara. The city&#x27;s workers had experienced poor living conditions and were swayed by promises of lower taxes and the abolition of slavery. Despite a soured welcome, due to the rebel army&#x27;s violence toward city residents, especially royalists, Hidalgo kept his promise and, on December 6, 1810, slavery was abolished in Guadalajara, a proclamation which has been honored since the end of the war. During this time, he founded the newspaper , dedicated to the insurgent cause.

Royalist forces marched to Guadalajara, arriving in January 1811 with nearly 6,000 men. Insurgents Ignacio Allende and Mariano Abasolo wanted to concentrate their forces in the city and plan an escape route should they be defeated, but Hidalgo rejected this idea. Their second choice was to make a stand at the Puente de Calderon just outside the city. Hidalgo had between 80,000 and 100,000 men and 95 cannons, but the better-trained royalists won, decimating the insurgent army and forcing Hidalgo to flee toward Aguascalientes. Guadalajara remained in royalist hands until near the end of the war.&#x27;
On January 17, 1817, the insurgent army was again defeated on the outskirts of Guadalajara in the Battle of Calderón Bridge.
New Galicia, now Jalisco, adhered to the Plan de Iguala on June 13, 1821.

In 1823, Guadalajara became the capital of the newly founded state of Jalisco. In 1844, General Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga initiated a revolt against the government of President Antonio López de Santa Anna. Santa Anna personally ensured that the revolt was quelled. However, while Santa Anna was in Guadalajara, a revolt called the Three Hour Revolution brought José Joaquín Herrera to the presidency and put Santa Anna into exile.

President Benito Juárez made Guadalajara the seat of his government in 1856, during the Reform War. French troops entered the city during the French Intervention in 1864, and it was retaken by Mexican troops in 1866.

Despite the violence, the 19th century was a period of economic, technological and social growth for the city. After Independence, small-scale industries developed, many of which were owned by European immigrants. Rail lines connecting the city to the Pacific coast and north to the United States intensified trade and allowed the shipment of products from rural areas of Jalisco. Ranch Culture became a very important aspect of Jalisco and Guadalajara&#x27;s identities during this time. From 1884 to 1890, electrical and railroad services, as well as the Guadalajara Observatory were established.

=== 20th century ===

Throughout the twentieth century, seeing growth in its industrial, tourist, and service industries, Guadalajara began a period of rapid transformation into the metropolis it is today. The city would gain the second largest economy in Mexico, following only by Mexico City. After the Mexican Revolution of 1910, Guadalajara became the second most populous city in the country. However, the decades that followed brought a number of regional wars in the states of Jalisco, Michoacán, and Guanajuato. The aftermath of the Great Depression took a further toll on the city. Fortunately, by the 1940s the city would experience industrial, demographic, and trade growth.

In 1910, the Mexican Revolution began, bringing an end to the . With conflict concentrated in the capital, Guadalajara experienced relative calm. After the Cristero Conflict, peace returned to Guadalajara and the city flourished, outgrowing its colonial roots. This period saw the birth of new schools of architecture that would decorate the city from the 1920s to the 1980s.

Guadalajara again experienced substantial growth after the 1930s, and the first industrial park was established in 1947. Its population surpassed one million in 1964, and by the 1970s it was Mexico&#x27;s second-largest city and the largest in western Mexico. Most of the modern city&#x27;s urbanization took place between the 1940s and the 1980s, with the population doubling every ten years until it stood at 2.5 million in 1980. The population of the municipality has stagnated, and even declined, slowly but steadily, since the early 1990s.

The increase in population brought with it an increase in the size of what is now called Greater Guadalajara, rather than an increase in the population density of the city. Migrants coming into Guadalajara from the 1940s to the 1980s were mostly from rural areas and lived in the city center until they had enough money to buy property. This property was generally bought in the edges of the city, which were urbanizing into , or residential areas. In the 1980s, it was described as a &quot;divided city&quot; east to west based on socioeconomic class. Since then, the city has evolved into four sectors, which are still more or less class-centered. The upper classes tend to live in Hidalgo and Juárez in the northwest and southwest, while the lower classes tend to live in the city center, Libertad in the northeast, and southeast in Reforma. However, lower class development has expanded on the city&#x27;s periphery and upper and middle classes are migrating toward Zapopan, making the situation less neatly divided.
Since 1996, the activity of multinational corporations has had a significant effect on the economic and social development of the city. The presence of companies such as Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola and IBM has been based on production facilities built outside the city proper, bringing in foreign labor and capital. This was made possible in the 1980s by surplus labor, infrastructure improvements, and government incentives. These companies focus on electrical and electronic items, which is now one of Guadalajara&#x27;s two main products (the other being beer). This has internationalized the economy, steering it away from manufacturing and toward services, dependent on technology and foreign investment. This has not been favorable for the unskilled working class and traditional labor sectors.

The 1992 Guadalajara explosions occurred on April 22, 1992, when gasoline explosions in the sewer system over four hours destroyed of streets in the downtown district of Analco. Gante Street was the most damaged. Officially, 206 people were killed, nearly 500 injured and 15,000 were left homeless. The estimated monetary damage ranges between $300 million and $1 billion. The affected areas can be recognized by their more modern architecture.

Three days before the explosion, residents started complaining of a strong gasoline-like smell coming from the sewers. City workers were dispatched to check the sewers and found dangerously high levels of gasoline fumes. However, no evacuations were ordered. An investigation into the disaster found that there were two precipitating causes. The first was new water pipes that were built too close to an existing gasoline pipeline. Chemical reactions between the pipes caused erosion. The second was a flaw in the sewer design that did not allow accumulated gases to escape.

Arrests were made to indict those responsible for the blasts. Four officials of Pemex (the state oil company) were indicted and charged on the basis of negligence. Ultimately, however, these people were cleared of all charges. Calls for the restructuring of PEMEX were made but they were successfully resisted.

The 1990s were marked by events such as the explosions of April 22, 1992, the Mexican peso crisis of 1994, and the murder of the Cardinal Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo in 1993. The 1992 explosions caused massive infrastructure damage to hundreds of houses, avenues, streets, and businesses in the Analco neighborhood (), &quot;without a clear delineator of information and responsibilities to date&quot;, in one of the most tragic events in the history of Guadalajara. The investigation of the facts lasted more than 11 years in which insufficient evidence was found to appoint a manager, investigations are now closed attributing the events to an accident. This event, in addition to Mexico&#x27;s 1994 economic crisis, resulted in the loss of Guadalajara&#x27;s industrial power.

== International events ==

The city has hosted numerous important international events, such as the first Cumbre Iberoamericana in 1991. The Third Summit of Heads of State and Governments of Latin America, the Caribbean, and the European Union was hosted in 2004. Guadalajara was also the venue to the Encuentro Internacional de Promotores y Gestores Culturales in 2005. The 2011 Pan American Games were staged and Guadalajara was named the American Capital of Culture in 2005 as well as the Ciudad Educadora in 2006. Guadalajara has been recognized as Mexico&#x27;s first Smart City due to its use of developing technology.

== Commercial hubs ==

During each government period, the city went through structural plans with which new areas and commercial hubs were born and with which transnational corporations and international industries arrived in the city. The city housed the first shopping malls in Mexico.

== Expansion and municipality merger ==

The city expanded rapidly before merging with the Zapopan municipality. Among the developments created during this period were the Guadalajara Expo, the light rail, shopping centers, the expansion of streets and avenues, and the birth and development of road infrastructure, services, tourism, industrial, etc. The first shopping center in Latin America emerged in the city, the first urban electric-train system in Latin America, and the first private university in Mexico.

In a 2007 survey entitled &quot;Cities of the Future&quot;, &quot;FDi magazine&quot; ranked Guadalajara first among major Mexican cities and second among major North American cities in terms of economic potential, behind Chicago. The magazine also rated it as the most business-friendly Latin American city in 2007.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Guadalajara has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;), a temperate climate that is quite close to a tropical climate, featuring dry warm winters and wet, mildly hot summers. Guadalajara&#x27;s climate is influenced by its high altitude and the general seasonality of precipitation patterns in western North America.

Although the temperature is warm year-round, Guadalajara has strong seasonal variation in precipitation. The northward movement of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone brings a great deal of rain in the summer months, whereas, for the rest of the year, the climate is rather dry, although daily rainfall records in each dry season month range from to . The extra moisture during the wet months moderates the temperatures, resulting in cooler days and nights during this period. The highest temperatures are usually reached in May averaging , but can reach up to just before the onset of monsoon season. March tends to be the driest month and July the wettest, with an average of of rain, over a quarter of the annual average of about .

During the summer, afternoon storms are very common and can sometimes bring hail flurries to the city, especially toward late August or September. Winters are relatively warm despite the city&#x27;s altitude, with January daytime temperatures reaching about and nighttime temperatures about . However, the outskirts of the city (generally those close to the Primavera Forest) experience on average cooler temperatures than the city itself. There, temperatures around can be recorded during the coldest nights. Frost may also occur during the coldest nights, but temperatures rarely fall below in the city, making it an uncommon phenomenon. Cold fronts in winter can sometimes bring light rain to the city for several days in a row. Snowfall is extraordinarily rare, with the last recorded one occurring in December 1997, which was the first time in 116 years, as it had previously last fallen in 1881.

=== Topography ===
Guadalajara&#x27;s natural wealth is represented by the La Primavera Forest, Los Colomos, and the Barranca de Huentitán. The flora in these areas includes michoacan pines, several species of oak, sweetgum, ash, willow, and introduced trees such as poincianas, jacarandas, and ficus. It also includes orchids, roses, and various species of fungi. The fauna includes typical urban fauna in addition to 106 species of mammals, 19 species of reptiles, and six species of fish.

La Barranca de Huentitán (the Huentitán Forest) (also known as Barranca de Oblatos and Barranca de Oblatos-Huentitán) is a National Park located just north of the municipality of Guadalajara. The barranca (canyon) borders two colonias (neighborhoods) of the city, Oblatos and Huentitan.
It covers approximately , and varies in altitude. The funicular railway in the park starts at above sea level and rises to above sea level. In the 16th century, during the Spanish Conquest, the Huentitán area including the canyon was the site of battles between local Indian populations and the Spanish. Later, it was the site of battles between different factions during the Mexican Revolution and the Cristero Rebellion.
The canyon is a biogeographic corridor that is home to four types of vegetation: deciduous tropical forest, gallery forest, heath vegetation, and secondary vegetation. In addition to introduced species, there are many native species of flora and fauna. The canyon is studied by national and international researchers as it contains great biological diversity due to its geographical location.
On June 5, 1997, it was declared a Protected Natural Area, as an Area Subject to Ecological Conservation (Zona Sujeta a Conservación Ecológica).

La Cascada Cola de Caballo (The Horse Tail Waterfall) is located on the Guadalajara to Zacatecas road (Highway 54, km 15) a few kilometers from the Northern Peripheral, just after passing the village of San Esteban. The waterfall is fed by a stream from the Atemajac Valley. It is close to Guadalajara and a town with very little development, and as a result of poor ecological practices, it is very polluted.

El Bosque los Colomos, the Colomos Forest, is located in the northwestern part of Guadalajara along the Rio Atemajac. It is in a wealthy part of the metropolitan area, and has been developed for recreation rather than being preserved in its wild state. The river was once one of the main sources of water supply to the city, and today continues to provide water to some surrounding colonias (neighborhoods). Currently, this forest covers an area of in which pine trees, eucalyptus trees, and cedars predominate. The park has jogging tracks, gardens (including a Japanese garden), ponds, a bird lake, instructional areas for school field days, playgrounds, camping areas, and horses to ride.

Other places of interest around Guadalajara include Camachos Aquatic Natural Park, a commercial water park, and Barranca Colimilla, a beautiful canyon with hiking trails near Tonala, east of Guadalajara.

=== Urbanism ===


Guadalajara&#x27;s street plan has evolved over time into a radial urban plan, with five major routes into and out of the city. It is surrounded by ring roads.

The original city of Guadalajara was planned on a grid, with north–south and east–west intersecting streets.
Over time, villages surrounding Guadalajara were incorporated into the city - first Analco to the southeast, then Mexicaltzingo to the south, Mezquitan to the north, and San Juan de Dios to the east, all of which introduced more variety to the plan. As it grew towards the west, it kept the original north–south orientation. As it grew towards the east, this grid was tilted towards the south-east to match up with the grids of the former towns Analco and San Juan de Dios, across the river from central Guadalajara on the eastern side of Rio San Juan de Dios (Rio San Juan de Dios is now underground; it runs beneath Calzada Independencia).

When the railway was introduced to Guadalajara in 1888, the southern part of the city began development, and its streets aligned with the grid to the east of the old Rio San Juan de Dios. Additional 20th-century expansion of the city introduced even more variety, as developers introduced different kinds of non-grid street plans in new areas. During the government of José de Jesús González Gallo, between 1947 and 1953, major public works changed the urban landscape of the historic center of the city.

Major controversial projects included the widening of Avenida 16 de Septiembre and Avenida Juárez, which were no longer adequate to handle car traffic in the center of the city. In the process, many buildings of architectural and historical value were demolished. Historical buildings around Guadalajara Cathedral were also demolished to leave large open spaces on the four sides of the Cathedral in the form of a large Latin cross, in which the cathedral is now centered. There were other, somewhat less controversial, projects to improve the flow of traffic and increase commerce in other parts of the city.

=== Districts ===
Guadalajara is made up of more than 2,300 colonias (neighborhoods) in the Metropolitan Area. The oldest parts of the city include Centro (the oldest in the city), Santuario, Mexicaltzingo, Mezquitan, Analco, and San Juan de Dios. Private houses in the oldest sector of the city are mostly made up of one- and two-level houses, with architectural styles ranging from simple colonial architecture to the Churrigueresco, Baroque, and early nineteenth century European styles.

Just west of the oldest part of the city are upper-class colonias built in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, containing the neoclassical structures and houses of the Porfiriato. In the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s well-to-do Tapatios expanded into colonias Lafayette, Americana, Moderna, and Arcos Vallarta. New architectural trends of the 1960s and 1970s also left their mark in colonias such as colonia Americana, Vallarta Poniente, Moderna, Providencia, Vallarta San Jorge, Jardines del Bosque, and Chapalita.

The Metropolitan Area has more wealthy neighborhoods than any other part of western Mexico. These colonias are located both inside and outside the municipality of Guadalajara, including some in its neighboring municipalities of Zapopan and Tlajomulco, in the west and south. Some of these colonias are: Colinas de San Javier, Puerta de Hierro, Providencia, Chapalita, Country Club, Ciudad del Sol, Valle Real, Lomas del Valle, Santa Rita, Monraz, Santa Anita Golf Club, El Cielo, Santa Isabel, Virreyes, Ciudad Bugambilias, Las Cañadas, and Royal Country.

In general, residents in the west of the city are the wealthiest, while residents in the east are the poorest.

New development to accommodate the growing population is made up of a mix of middle-class colonias and housing complexes developed as part of government plans, and colonias developed less formally for working-class people. The Metropolitan Area extends to the west in colonias such as Pinar de la Calma, Las Fuentes, Paseos del Sol, El Colli Urbano, and La Estancia and extends to the east in colonias such as San Juan Bosco, San Andrés, Oblatos, Santa Cecilia, Insurgentes, Jardines de la Paz, and Tetlán.

The expansion of the population creates a constant demand for more colonias and more government infrastructure services.
=== Parks ===

Parks and forests are important in Guadalajara; while many of the oldest neighborhoods of the municipality of Guadalajara do not have sufficient green spaces, of the three most important metropolitan areas in Mexico, the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area (ZMG) has the greenest areas and plants.

&quot;The most important parks are:&quot;

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms or seal of Guadalajara consists of a blue field, a pine of sinople outlined, two lions rampantes of color, opposite to forehead and the legs on the trunk, embroidery is of gold, consists of seven arms of gules. For stamp, closed helmet and for cimera a flag of gules, loaded with a cross of Jerusalem to the one that uses as shaft a lance of the same color, the lambrequins are of gold and blue alternated.

The blue field means loyalty and serenity, the pine of sinople means noble thoughts, the lions sovereignty and warlike spirit, the arms mean protection, favor and purity of the feelings, honor to the Battle of Baeza against the Moors in 1227. The helmet represents a degree of nobility, victory in the combat, the cross of Jerusalem means that the conquerors were descendants of the gentlemen of the crusades, and the lance signifies strength that is tempered by prudence.

Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, granted the title of city to Guadalajara and granted the shield in 1539.

== Demographics ==

The most current figures by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), confirmed in 2010, the municipality of Guadalajara has a population of approximately 1,495,189, with a population in the metropolitan area of 4,334,878, the most populous city in the state of Jalisco, the most conurbation-highest-population within the province of Jalisco of the Guadalajara metropolitan area, and the second-most populous city in Mexico; the first being Mexico City.

In 2007, the United Nations listed the world&#x27;s 100 most populous urban agglomerations. Mexico excelled with three cities on the list: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. Guadalajara ranked 66th in these cities, followed by Sydney and Washington, D.C. On the Latin American list, Guadalajara ranked 10th.

The municipality of Guadalajara is located in the center of the State, a little to the east, at coordinates 20-&amp;36&#x27; 40&quot; to 20- 45&#x27; 00&quot; north latitude and 103- 16&#x27; 00&quot; to 103- 24&#x27; 00&quot; west-latitude and 103-&amp;16&#x27; 00&quot; to 103- 24&#x27; 00&quot; west-west longitude, at a height of 1700 meters above sea level.

The municipality of Guadalajara is bounded to the north by Zapopan and Ixtlahuacán del Río, to the east by Tonalá and Zapotlanejo, to the south with Tlaquepaque and to the west with Zapopan.

=== Guadalajara Metropolitan Area ===
The Guadalajara metropolitan area is the second most populous metropolitan area in the country and the agglomeration has six central municipalities and three exterior municipalities. The central municipalities are Guadalajara, Zapopan, Tlaquepaque, Tonalá, Tlajomulco, and El Salto, Jalisco. The exterior municipalities are Ixtlahuacán de los Membrillos, Juanacatlán, and Zapotlanejo.

The growth of the city is due to Guadalajara absorbing the closest communities. This was the case with the former communities Atemajac, Huentitán, Tetlán, Analco, Mexicaltzingo, Mezquitan, and San Andrés, among others.

Some of the closest communities to Guadalajara:

* Ixtlahuacán del Río (21.7 km from the municipal seat of Guadalajara,).
* Santa Anita (19.6 km from Guadalajara&#x27;s municipal seat, ).
* Santa Cruz de las Flores (27.9 km from the municipal seat of Guadalajara,).
* Nuevo México (14 km from municipal seat of Guadalajara, ).
* Tesistán (20,8 km from the municipal seat of Guadalajara, ).
* La Primavera (24.4 km from the municipal seat of Guadalajara,).

== Economy ==

Guadalajara has the third-largest economy and industrial infrastructure in Mexico and contributes 37% of the state of Jalisco&#x27;s total gross production. Its economic base is strong and well-diversified, mainly based on commerce and services, although the manufacturing sector plays a defining role. It is ranked in the top ten in Latin America in gross domestic product and the third-highest ranking in Mexico.

In its 2007 survey entitled &quot;Cities of the Future&quot;, &quot;FDi magazine&quot; ranked Guadalajara highest among major Mexican cities and designated Guadalajara as having the second strongest economic potential of any major North American city behind Chicago. &quot;FDI&quot; ranked it as the most business-friendly Latin American city in 2007. The same research noted Guadalajara as a &quot;city of the future&quot; due to its youthful population, low unemployment and large number of recent foreign investment deals; it was found to be the third most business-friendly city in North America.

In 2009 Moody&#x27;s Investors Service assigned ratings of Ba1 (Global Scale, local currency) and A1.mx (Mexican national scale). During the prior five years, the municipality&#x27;s financial performance had been mixed but had begun to stabilize in the latter two years. Guadalajara manages one of the largest budgets among Mexican municipalities and its revenue per capita indicator (Ps. $2,265) places it above the average for Moody&#x27;s-rated municipalities in Mexico.

The city&#x27;s economy has two main sectors. Commerce and tourism employ most: about 60% of the population. The other is industry, which has been the engine of economic growth and the basis of Guadalajara&#x27;s economic importance nationally even though it employs only about a third of the population. Industries here produce products such as food and beverages, toys, textiles, auto parts, electronic equipment, pharmaceuticals, footwear, furniture and steel products.

Two of the major industries have been textiles and shoes, which are still dynamic and growing. Sixty percent of manufactured products are sold domestically, while forty percent are exported, mostly to the United States. This makes Guadalajara&#x27;s economic fortunes dependent on those of the U.S., both as a source of investment and as a market for its goods.

The city has to compete with China, especially for electronics industries which rely on high volume and low wages. This has caused it to move toward high-mix, mid-volume, and value-added services, such as automotive. However, its traditional advantage of proximity to the U.S. market is one reason Guadalajara stays competitive. Mexico ranked third in 2009 in Latin America for the export of information technology services, behind Brazil and Argentina. This kind of service is mostly related to online and telephone technical support. The major challenge this sector has is the lack of university graduates who speak English.

=== Technology ===

The electronics and information technology sectors that have nicknamed the city the &quot;Silicon Valley of Mexico.&quot; Guadalajara is the main producer of software, electronic and digital components in Mexico. Telecom and computer equipment from Guadalajara accounts for about a quarter of Mexico&#x27;s electronics exports. Companies such as General Electric, IBM, Sanmina, Intel, HCL Technologies, Hitachi, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc, Siemens, Flextronics, Oracle, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services, Cognizant Technology Solutions and Jabil Circuit have facilities in the city or its suburbs. This phenomenon began after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). International firms started building facilities in Mexico, especially Guadalajara, displacing Mexican firms, especially in information technology. One of the problems this has created is that when there are economic downturns, these international firms scale back.

Guadalajara was selected as &quot;Smart City&quot; in 2013 by IEEE, the world&#x27;s largest professional association for the advancement of technology.

Several cities invest in the areas of research to design pilot projects and as an example, in early March in 2013 was the first &quot;Cluster Smart Cities&quot; in the world, composed of Dublin, Ireland; San Jose, California; Cardiff, Wales, and Guadalajara, Jalisco, whose objective is the exchange of information and experiences that can be applied in principle to issues of agribusiness and health sciences.

The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation also reported that Guadalajara, Jalisco was chosen as the official venue for the first &quot;Digital Creative City of Mexico and Latin America&quot;, which will be the spearhead for Mexico to consolidate the potential in this area.

The &quot;Cluster Smart Cities&quot; unprecedented in the world, will focus on what each of these cities is making in innovation and the creation of an alliance to attract technology. The Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Technology (SICyT ) of Jalisco, said the combination of talent development investments allows Jalisco to enter the &quot;knowledge economy.&quot;

From 25 to 28 October 2015, the city was the venue for the first conference of the Smart Cities Initiative.

=== Industries ===

Most of the economy revolves around commerce, employing 60% of the population. This activity has mainly focused on the purchase and sale of the following products: food and beverages, textiles, electronic appliances, tobacco, cosmetics, sports articles, construction materials, and others. Guadalajara&#x27;s commercial activity is second only to Mexico City.

The city is the national leader in the development and investment of shopping malls. Many shopping centers have been built, such as Galeries Plaza, one of the largest shopping centers in Latin America, and Andares. Galerías Guadalajara covers and has 220 stores. It contains the two largest movie theaters in Latin America, both with IMAX screens. It hosts art exhibits and fashion shows and has an area for cultural workshops. Anchor stores includes Liverpool and Sears and specialty stores such as Hugo Boss, Max Mara, Lacoste, Tesla Motors, Costco. Best Buy opened its first Guadalajara store here. It has an additional private entrance on the top floor of the adjacent parking lot. Another Best Buy store was inaugurated in Ciudadela Lifestyle Center mall, which was the chain&#x27;s third-largest in the world, according to the company.

Andares is another important commercial center in Zapopan. This $530 million mixed-use complex opened in 2008, designed by renowned Mexican Sordo Madaleno architecture firm features luxury residences and a high-level mall anchored by two large department stores, Liverpool and El Palacio de Hierro. The 133,000 m2 (1,400,000+ sq ft) mall offers hundreds of stores, a big food court located on the second floor, and several restaurants at the Paseo Andares.

A large segment of the commercial sector caters to tourists and other visitors. Recreational tourism is mainly concentrated in the historic downtown. In addition to being a cultural and recreational attraction and thanks to its privileged geographical location, the city serves as an axis to nearby popular beach destinations such as Puerto Vallarta, Manzanillo and Mazatlán. Other types of visitors include those who travel to attend seminars, conventions and other events in fields such as academic, entertainment, sports, and business. The best-known venue for this purpose is the Expo Guadalajara, a large convention center surrounded by several hotels. It was built in 1987, and it is considered the most important convention center in Mexico.

=== Foreign trade ===

Most of Guadalajara&#x27;s economic growth since 1990 has been tied with foreign investment. International firms have invested here to take advantage of the relatively cheap but educated and highly productive labor, establishing manufacturing plants that re-export their products to the United States, as well as provide goods for the domestic Mexican market.

A media report in early October 2013 stated that five major Indian IT (information technology) companies have established offices in Guadalajara, while several other Indian IT companies continue to explore the option of expanding to Mexico. Due to the competitiveness in the Indian IT sector, companies are expanding internationally and Mexico offers an affordable opportunity for Indian companies to better position themselves to enter the United States market. The trend emerged after 2006 and the Mexican government offers incentives to foreign companies.

Exports from the city went from US$3.92 billion in 1995 to 14.3 billion in 2003. From 1990 to 2000, socio-economic indicators show that quality of life improved overall; however, there is still a large gap between the rich and the poor, and the rich have benefited from the globalization and privatization of the economy more than the poor.

International investment has affected the labor market in the metro area and that of the rural towns and villages that surround it. Guadalajara is the distribution center for the region and its demands have led to a shifting of employment, from traditional agriculture and crafts to manufacturing and commerce in urban centers. This has led to mass migration from the rural areas to the metropolitan area.

== Culture ==


Guadalajara has a lively cultural life. The city exhibits works by international artists and is a must-see for international cultural events whose radius of influence reaches most of the countries of Latin America, including the southwestern United States.

Its historic center houses colonial buildings of a religious and civil character, which stand out for their architectural and historical significance, and constitute a rich mixture of styles whose root is found in indigenous cultural contributions (mainly of incorporated into the Mozarabic and the castilian), and later in modern European influences (mainly French and Italian). The historic center also has museums, theaters, galleries, libraries, auditoriums, and concert halls. Some of these buildings date from the sixteenth and seventeenth century, such as the Cathedral of the Archdiocese of Guadalajara, among others.

The city has several radio stations focused on culture, one of them being Red Radio University of Guadalajara (XHUG-F), which is transmitted to the rest of the state and neighboring states and internationally through the Internet; it is also the first broadcaster via podcast in the country. The city produces a fully cultural television channel, XHGJG-TV; Guadalajara is the only city to produce a cultural cutting channel in the country in addition to the Mexico, D.F.A. in Mexico City.

This city has been the cradle and dwelling of distinguished poets, writers, painters, actors, film directors and representatives of the arts, etc., such as José Clemente Orozco, Dr. Atl, Roberto Montenegro, Alejandro Zohn, Luis Barragán, Carlos Orozco Romero, Federico Fabregat, Raul Anguiano, Juan Soriano, Javier Campos Cabello, Martha Pacheco, Alejandro Colunga, José Fors, Juan Kraeppellin, Davis Birks, Carlos Vargas Pons, Jis, Trino, Erandini, Enrique Oroz, Rubén Méndez, Mauricio Toussaint, Scott Neri, Paula Santiago, Edgar Cobian, L. Felipe Manzano, and (the artist formerly known as Mevna); the freeplay guitarist and music composer for the movies &quot;El Mariachi&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zorro&quot;, Paco Rentería; important exponents of literature such as Juan Rulfo, Francisco Rojas, Agustín Yáñez, Elías Nandino, Idella Purnell, Jorge Souza, among others; classic repertoire composers such as Gonzalo Curiel, José Pablo Moncayo, Antonio Navarro, Ricardo Zohn, Carlos Sánchez-Gutiérrez and Gabriel Pareyon; film directors such as Felipe Cazals, Jaime Humberto Hermosillo, Erik Stahl, Guillermo del Toro; and actors such as Katy Jurado, Enrique Alvarez Felix, and Gael García Bernal.

Guadalajara was the first Mexican city to be accepted as a member of the International Association of Educational Cities due to its strong character and identity, potential for economic development through culture.

Guadalajara was designated as the World Book Capital for 2022 by UNESCO.

Despite the Guadalajara area historically being an ethnically Caxcan region, the Nahua peoples form the majority of Guadalajara&#x27;s indigenous population. There are several thousand indigenous language speakers in Guadalajara although the majority of the indigenous population is integrated within the general population and can speak Spanish.

=== Museums ===

The museums in Guadalajara are an extension of the cultural infrastructure of this city. Many of them stand out for their architectural and historical significance. There are more than 189 forums of art exhibition among cultural centers, museums, private galleries, and cultural spaces of the town hall, several of them with centuries of existence and some others in the process of being built. The museums in Guadalajara belong to the cultural framework of the city, among which are in all its genres exhibiting history, paleontology, archeology, ethnography, paintings, crafts, plastic, photography, sculpture, works of circuits international art, etc.

Guadalajara has twenty two museums, which include the Regional Museum of Jalisco, the Wax Museum, the Trompo Mágico children&#x27;s museum and the Museum of Anthropology. The Former Hospice Cabañas in the historic center is a World Heritage Site. For these attributes and others, the city was named an American Capital of Culture in 2005.

Guadalajara and the surrounding metropolitan area have numerous public, private, and digital libraries for the search and consultation of information. The promotion of culture and the enrichment of reading have made it easier for the citizen to require several facilities in the city. Some of the libraries also have a physical enclosure—among them the historic Octavio Paz Ibero-American Library of the University of Guadalajara and the Public Library of the State of Jalisco located in the adjoining city of Zapopan—with options for querying digital information over the Internet.

The Jalisco Regional Museum (formerly the seminary of San José) was built at the beginning of the 18th century to be the Seminario Conciliar de San José. From 1861 to 1914, it housed a school called Liceo de Varones. In 1918, it became the Museum of Fine Arts. In 1976, it was completely remodeled for its present use. The museum displays its permanent collection in 16 halls, 15 of which are dedicated to Paleontology, Pre-History, and Archeology. One of the prized exhibits is a complete mammoth skeleton. The other two halls are dedicated to painting and history. The painting collection includes works by Juan Correa, Cristóbal de Villalpando and José de Ibarra.

=== Architecture ===

The style of architecture prevalent in Europe during the founding of Guadalajara is paralleled in the city&#x27;s colonial buildings. The Metropolitan Cathedral and Teatro Degollado are the purest examples of neoclassical architecture. The historical center hosts religious and civil colonial buildings, which are noted for their architectural and historical significance and are a rich mix of styles that are rooted in indigenous cultural contributions (mainly from Ute origin), incorporated in the Mozarabic and castizo, and later in modern European influences (mainly French and Italian) and American (specifically, from the United States).
Guadalajara&#x27;s historical center has an assortment of museums, theaters, galleries, libraries, auditoriums and concert halls, particular mention may be made to Former Hospice Cabañas (which dates from the 18th century), the Teatro Degollado (considered the oldest opera house in Mexico), the Teatro Galerías and the Teatro Diana. The Former Hocpice Cabañas, which is home to some of the paintings (murals and easel) by José Clemente Orozco, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997. Among the many structures of beauty is the International Headquarters Temple of in Colonia Hermosa Provincia, which is the largest in Latin America.

During the Porfiriato the French style invaded the city because of the passion of former president Porfirio Díaz in the trends of French style, also Italian architects were responsible for shaping the Gothic structures that were built in the city. The passage of time reflected different trends from the baroque to churrigueresque, Gothic and neoclassical pure.

=== Landmarks ===

The historic downtown of Guadalajara is the oldest section of the city, where it was founded and where the oldest buildings are. It centers on Paseo Morelos/Paseo Hospicio from the Plaza de Armas, where the seats of ecclesiastical and secular power are, east toward the Plaza de los Mariachis and the Former Hospice Cabañas. The Plaza de Armas is a rectangular plaza with gardens, ironwork benches and an ironwork kiosk which was made in Paris in the 19th century.
Within Guadalajara&#x27;s historic downtown, there are many squares and public parks: Morelos Park, Mariachis Square, Founders Square, Tapatía Square, Agave Square, Parque Revolucion, Sanctuary Garden, Arms Square, Plaza de la Liberación, Guadalajara Square and the Jalisco Famous People Roundabout, the last four of which surround the cathedral to form a Latin Cross.

Construction began on the Metropolitan Cathedral in 1558 and the church was consecrated in 1616. Its two towers were built in the 19th century after an earthquake destroyed the originals. They are considered one of the city&#x27;s symbols. The architecture is a mix of Gothic, Baroque, Moorish and Neoclassical. The interior has three naves and eleven side altars, covered by a roof supported by 30 Doric columns.
The Jalisco Famous People Roundabout (Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres) is a monument made of quarried stone, built in 1952 to honor the memory of distinguished people from Jalisco. A circular structure of 17 columns surrounds 98 urns containing the remains of those honored. Across the street is the municipal palace which was built in 1952. It has four façades of quarried stone. It is mostly of Neoclassical design with elements such as courtyards, entrances, and columns that imitate the older structures of the city.

The Palace of the State Government is in Churrigueresque and Neoclassical styles and was begun in the 17th century and finished in 1774. The interior was completely remodeled after an explosion in 1859. This building contains murals by José Clemente Orozco, a native of Jalisco, including &quot;Lucha Social&quot;, &quot;Circo Político&quot;, &quot;Las Fuerzas Ocultas&quot;, and &quot;Hidalgo&quot;, which depicts Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla with his arm raised above his head in anger at the government and the church.

The cathedral is bordered to the east by the Plaza de la Liberación (Freedom Square), nicknamed the Two Cups Square (Plaza de las Dos Copas), referring to the two fountains on the east and west sides. Facing this square is the Degollado Theater (Teatro Degollado). It was built in the mid-nineteenth century in Neoclassical design. The main portal has a pediment with a scene in relief called &quot;Apollo and the Muses&quot; sculpted in marble by Benito Castañeda. The interior vaulted ceiling is painted with a fresco by Jacobo Gálvez and Gerardo Suárez which depicts a scene from the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Behind the theater is another square with a fountain called the Founders Fountain (Fuente de los Fundadores). The square is in the exact spot where the city was founded and contains a sculpture depicting Cristóbal de Oñate at the event.

Between the Cathedral and the Hospice is the large Plaza Tapatía, which covers . Its centerpiece is &quot;Inmolación de Quetzalcóatl&quot;. Southeast of this square is the Mercado Libertad, also called the Mercado de San Juan de Dios, one of the largest traditional markets in Mexico. The Temple of San Juan de Dios, a Baroque church built in the 17th century, is next to the market.
At the far east end is the Plaza de los Mariachis and the Former Hospice Cabañas. The Plaza de los Mariachis is faced by restaurants where one can hear live mariachis play, especially at night. The Cabañs Former Hospice extends along the entire east side of the Plaza. This building was constructed by Manuel Tolsá beginning in 1805 under orders of Carlos III. It was inaugurated and began its function as an orphanage in 1810, in spite of the fact that it would not be finished until 1845. It was named after Bishop Ruiz de Cabañas y Crespo. The façade is Neoclassical and its main entrance is topped by a triangular pediment. Today, it is the home of the Instituto Cultural Cabañas (Cabañas Cultural Institute) and its main attraction is the murals by José Clemente Orozco, which cover the main entrance hall. Among these murals is &quot;Hombre del Fuego&quot; (Man of Fire), considered to be one of Orozco&#x27;s finest works.

Off this east–west axis are other significant constructions. The Legislative Place is Neoclassical and was originally built in the 18th century. It was reconstructed in 1982. The Palace of Justice was finished in 1897. The Old University Building was a Jesuit college named Santo Tomás de Aquino. It was founded in 1591. It became the second Mexican University in 1792. Its main portal is of yellow stone. The Casa de los Perros (House of the Dogs) was constructed in 1896 in Neoclassical design. On Avenida Juarez is the Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora del Carmen which was founded between 1687 and 1690 and remodeled completely in 1830. It retains its original coat of arms of the Carmelite Order as well as sculptures of the prophets Elijah and Elisha. Adjoining it is what is left of the Carmelite monastery, which was one of the richest in New Spain.

=== Music ===
Mariachi music is strongly associated with Guadalajara both in Mexico and abroad even though the musical style originated in the nearby town of Cocula, Jalisco. The connection between the city and mariachi began in 1907 when an eight-piece mariachi band and four dancers from the city performed on stage at the president&#x27;s residence for both Porfirio Díaz and the Secretary of State of the United States. This made the music a symbol of west Mexico, and after the migration of many people from the Guadalajara area to Mexico City (mostly settling near Plaza Garibaldi), it then became a symbol of Mexican identity as well.

Guadalajara hosts the Festival of Mariachi and Charreria, which began in 1994. It attracts people in the fields of art, culture and politics from Mexico and abroad. Regularly the best mariachis in Mexico participate, such as Mariachi Vargas, Mariachi de América and Mariachi los Camperos de Nati Cano. Mariachi bands from all over the world participate, coming from countries such as Venezuela, Cuba, Belgium, Chile, France, Australia, Slovak Republic, Canada and the United States.

The events of this festival take place in venues all over the metropolitan area, and include a parade with floats. In August 2009, 542 mariachi musicians played together for a little over ten minutes to break the world record for largest mariachi group. The musicians played various songs ending with two classic Mexican songs &quot;Cielito Lindo&quot; and &quot;Guadalajara.&quot; The feat was performed during the XVI Encuentro Internacional del Mariachi y la Charreria. The prior record was 520 musicians in 2007 in San Antonio, Texas.

In the historic center of the city is the Plaza de los Mariachis, named such as many groups play here. The plaza was renovated for the 2011 Pan American Games in anticipation of the crowds visiting. Over 750 mariachi musicians play traditional melodies on the plaza, and along with the restaurants and other businesses, the plaza supports more than 830 families.

A recent innovation has been the fusion of mariachi melodies and instruments with rock and roll performed by rock musicians in the Guadalajara area. An album collecting a number of these melodies was produced called &quot;Mariachi Rock-O.&quot; There are plans to take these bands on tour in Mexico, the United States and Europe.

The city is also host to several dance and ballet companies such as the Chamber Ballet of Jalisco, the Folkloric Ballet of the University of Guadalajara, and the University of Guadalajara Contemporary Ballet.

The city is home to a renowned symphony orchestra. The Orquesta Filarmónica de Jalisco (Jalisco Philharmonic Orchestra) was founded by José Rolón in 1915. It held concerts from that time until 1924, when state funding was lost. However, the musicians kept playing to keep the orchestra alive. This eventually caught the attention of authorities and funding was restated in 1939. Private funding started in the 1940s and in 1950, an organization called Conciertos Guadalajara A. C. was formed to continue fundraising for the orchestra. In 1971, the orchestra became affiliated with the Department of Fine Arts of the State of Jalisco. The current name was adopted in 1988/ International soloists such as Paul Badura-Skoda, Claudio Arrau, Jörg Demus, Henryck Szeryng, Nicanor Zabaleta, Plácido Domingo, Kurt Rydl and Alfred Brendel have performed with the organization. Today the orchestra is under the direction of Marco Parisotto.

=== Cuisine ===
As in the rest of Mexico, food in Guadalajara is a mix of pre-Hispanic and Spanish influences. Typical Mexican dishes, such as pozole, tamales, sopes, enchiladas, tacos, menudo (soup), carne en su jugo and frijoles charros are popular.

One dish specific to Guadalajara is the &quot;torta ahogada.&quot; It consists of a salted bun or roll (typically birote) smeared with refried beans, with fried pork cut into pieces — also known as &quot;carnitas&quot; — all in tomato sauce seasoned with spices. It is eaten with onions reduced in lemon and hot sauce. Accompanying drinks can include tejuino, which is made with a base of sourdough corn accompanied by lemon ice cream, or tepache, which is made from the bark of fermented pineapple.

Another typical meal of Guadalajara and the entire state of Jalisco is the &quot;birria&quot;, which is usually made with either pork, beef, or goat. Handcrafted birria is made in a special oven, which can be underground and covered with maguey leaves; the meat can be mixed with a tomato broth and spices, or consumed separately. The traditional way of preparing birria is to pit roast the meat and spices wrapped in maguey leaves. It is served in bowls with minced onion, limes and tortillas.
Another typical dish of the tapatía kitchen is the &quot;&quot; This dish consists of a beef broth with beans from the pot and is accompanied by bacon, coriander, onion, and radish (sliced or whole). The dessert that is considered as a typical tapatío is the jericalla.

When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Aztec empire, a few religious ceremonies included eating pozole made with hominy and human flesh. This was the first type of pozole mentioned in Spanish writing, as a ritual dish eaten only by select priests and noblemen. The meat from the thighs of slain enemy warriors was used. The Franciscan missionaries ended this custom when they banned Aztec religious ceremonies. The pozole in the local common cuisine was related to the ritual dish, but prepared with turkey meat, and later pork, not with human flesh.

Other dishes that are popular here include pozole, a soup prepared with hominy, pork or chicken, topped with cabbage, radishes, minced onions, and other condiments; pipián, which is a sauce prepared with peanuts, squash and sesame seed, and biónico, a popular local dessert.

Jericallas are a typical Guadalajara dessert that is similar to flan, that was created to give children proper nutrients while being delicious. It is made with eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon, and baked in the oven where it is broiled to the point that a burnt layer is produced. The burnt layer at the surface is what makes this dessert special and delicious.

One of the drinks that is popular in Guadalajara is Tejuino, a refreshing drink that contains a corn fermented base with sugarcane, lime, salt and chili powder.

The city hosts the Feria Internacional Gastronomía (International Gastronomy Fair) each year in September showcasing Mexican and international cuisines. Many restaurants, bars, bakeries and cafés participate as well as producers of beer, wine and tequila.

Guadalajara hosted the 2011 Pan American Games. Since winning the bid to host the Games, the city had been undergoing extensive renovations. The games brought in more than 5,000 athletes from approximately 42 countries from the Americas and the Caribbean. Sports included aquatics, football, racquetball, and 27 more, with six others being considered. COPAG (the Organizing Committee for the Pan American Games Guadalajara 2011) had a total budget of US$250 million with the aim of updating the city&#x27;s sports and general infrastructure. The center of the city was repaved and new hotels were constructed for the approximately 22,000 rooms that were needed in 2011. The new bus rapid transit (BRT) system, Macrobús, was launched in March and runs along Avenida Independencia. The Pan-American village was built around the Bajio Zone. After the Games, the buildings will be used for housing.

== Government ==
As the capital of the state, the city is the seat of the state&#x27;s government. As a result, state politics have a heavy influence on local decision-making and vice versa. Historically, the mayorship of the city has been a common leaping platform for the state governorship. Additionally, because of the sheer size of the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area vis-à-vis the rest of the state, the city&#x27;s urban agglomeration—largely dominated and coordinated by the Guadalajara city council—captures 12 of the 20 seats in the state legislature allocated by the district.

All three branches of the state government are concentrated around the historic city center, with the Palace of Government, the seat of the state executive, immediately southeast of the cathedral. North, across the Freedom Square (Plaza de la Liberación), is the State Legislature Building, and immediately east of the latter is the Supreme Tribunal of State Justice.
Like other municipalities in Mexico, Guadalajara is governed by a municipal president, who exercises executive power for three consecutive years. This office is currently occupied by Enrique Alfaro (Movimiento Ciudadano).

The legislature has the cabildo, formed by the form chosen by the candidate for mayor, made up of aldermen, who are not elected by the people by direct or indirect voting, but the return happens automatically if the mayor wins.

The municipality is divided into five electoral districts for the purpose of election of representatives of the city in the federal legislature. These districts are the VIII, IX, XI, XIII, and XIV of the state of Jalisco.

The city and the municipality of Guadalajara are essentially co extensive with over 99% of the municipality living within the city limits and nearly all of the municipality urbanized. Urbanization centered on the city spreads out over seven other municipalities; of Zapopan, Tlaquepaque, Tonalá, Tlajomulco, El Salto, Ixtlahuacán de los Membrillos, and Juanacatlán.

These areas form the &quot;Guadalajara Metropolitan Area&quot; (Zona Metropolitana de Guadalajara in Spanish), which is the most populous in the state of Jalisco and the third most populous in the country after the Mexico City Metropolitan area. This metropolitan area had a population of 4,298,715 in 2008.

<doc id="73211" wikidata="Q918450" url="?curid=73211" title="1979 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The 1979 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 3 May 1979 to elect 635 members to the House of Commons. The election was held following the defeat of the Labour government in a no-confidence motion on 28 March 1979, six months before the Parliament was due for dissolution in October 1979.

The Conservative Party, led by Margaret Thatcher, ousted the incumbent Labour government of Prime Minister James Callaghan, gaining a parliamentary majority of 43 seats. The election was the first of four consecutive election victories for the Conservative Party, and Thatcher became the United Kingdom&#x27;s and Europe&#x27;s first elected female head of government, marking the beginning of 18 years in government for the Conservatives and 18 years in opposition for Labour.

Unusually, the date chosen coincided with the 1979 local elections. The local government results provided some source of comfort to the Labour Party, who recovered some lost ground from local election reversals in previous years, despite losing the general election. The parish council elections were pushed back a few weeks.

The previous parliamentary term had begun in October 1974, when Harold Wilson led Labour to a majority of three seats, seven months after forming a minority government following a hung parliament and the failure of Edward Heath&#x27;s Conservative government to form a coalition with the Liberals. Wilson had previously led the party in government from October 1964 to June 1970, and had served as party leader since February 1963.

However, after just two years back in Downing Street, he had resigned as prime minister, being succeeded by James Callaghan; and within a further year the government&#x27;s narrow parliamentary majority had gone. Callaghan made agreements with the Liberals and later the Ulster Unionists, as well as the Scottish and Welsh nationalists, in order to remain in power. The Lib-Lab pact lasted until July 1978.

However, on 28 March 1979, following the defeat of the Scottish devolution referendum, Thatcher tabled a motion of no confidence in Callaghan&#x27;s Labour government, which was passed by just one vote (311 to 310), triggering a general election six months before the end of the government&#x27;s term. It was the first government to lose a motion of no-confidence in the House of Commons since the first Labour government led by Ramsay MacDonald in October 1924.

The Labour campaign was hampered by recent memories of a series of industrial disputes and strikes during the winter of 1978–79, known as the Winter of Discontent, and the party focused its campaign on support for the National Health Service and full employment. After intense media speculation that a general election would be held before the end of 1978, Callaghan had announced early in the autumn of that year that a general election would not take place that year, having received private polling data which suggested a parliamentary majority was unlikely.

The Conservative campaign employed the advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, and pledged to control inflation as well as curbing the power of the trade unions. The Conservatives also ran their campaign on the theme that &quot;Labour Isn&#x27;t Working&quot; (unemployment reached a 40-year high of 1.5 million during 1978). The Liberal Party was damaged by allegations that Jeremy Thorpe, its former leader, had been involved in a homosexual affair and had conspired to murder his former lover. The Liberals were now being led by David Steel, meaning that all three major parties entered the election with a new leader.

The election saw a 5.2% swing from Labour to the Conservatives, the largest swing since the 1945 election, which Clement Attlee won for Labour. Margaret Thatcher became prime minister, and Callaghan was replaced as Labour leader by Michael Foot in 1980. The results of the election were broadcast live on the BBC, and presented by David Dimbleby and Robin Day, with Robert McKenzie on the &quot;Swingometer&quot;, and further analysis provided by David Butler. It was the first general election to feature Rick Wakeman&#x27;s song &quot;Arthur&quot; during the BBC&#x27;s coverage. On ITV, the election broadcast was hosted by Alastair Burnet, Martyn Lewis, Peter Snow and Leonard Parkin.

Because of the anaemic economic and social backdrop in this election, it presaged the 1980 United States presidential election 18 months later in which, in a situation with some parallels, incumbent US President Jimmy Carter was likewise defeated by Republican challenger Ronald Reagan, an advocate of similar socioeconomic policies to those of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Britain.

Future Prime Minister John Major, who went on to succeed Thatcher in November 1990, entered Parliament at this election, retaining the Huntingdonshire seat in Cambridgeshire for the Conservatives. Prominent MPs Jeremy Thorpe, Shirley Williams and Barbara Castle were among the members of parliament who retired or lost their seats.
== Timeline ==
After suffering a vote of no confidence on 28 March 1979, Prime Minister James Callaghan was forced to announce that he would request a dissolution of Parliament to bring about a general election. The key dates were as follows:
== Background ==
Callaghan succeeded Harold Wilson as the Labour prime minister after the latter&#x27;s surprise resignation in April 1976. By March 1977, Labour had become a minority government after two by-election defeats cost them the three-seat majority they had won in October 1974, and from March 1977 to August 1978 Callaghan governed by an agreement with the Liberal Party through the Lib–Lab pact. Callaghan had considered calling an election in the autumn of 1978, but ultimately decided that imminent tax cuts, and a possible economic upturn in 1979, could favour his party at the polls and delayed the election until the following year. Although published opinion polls suggested that he might win, private polls commissioned by the Labour Party from MORI had suggested the two main parties had much the same level of support.

However, events would soon overtake the Labour government and prove Callaghan&#x27;s decision to delay an election to be a costly mistake. A series of industrial disputes in the winter of 1978–79, dubbed the &quot;Winter of Discontent&quot;, led to widespread strikes across the country and seriously hurt Labour&#x27;s standings in the polls while boosting support for the Conservative opposition. When the Scottish National Party (SNP) withdrew support for the Scotland Act 1978, a vote of no confidence was held and passed by one vote on 28 March 1979, forcing Callaghan to call a general election. As the previous election had been held in October 1974, Labour could have held on until the autumn of 1979 if it had not been for the lost confidence vote.

Margaret Thatcher had won her party&#x27;s 1975 leadership election over former leader Edward Heath, taking over the leadership of the party in February 1975, four months after the party&#x27;s failure to win the October 1974 election. Heath had led the party for a decade but lost three of the four elections he contested.

David Steel had replaced Jeremy Thorpe as leader of the Liberal Party in 1976, after allegations of homosexuality and conspiracy to murder his former lover forced Thorpe to resign. The Thorpe affair led to a fall in the Liberal vote, after what had been thought to be a breakthrough in the February 1974 election.

=== Campaign ===
This was the first election since 1959 to feature three new leaders for the main political parties. The three main parties all advocated cutting income tax. Labour and the Conservatives did not specify the exact thresholds of income tax they would implement but the Liberals did, claiming they would have income tax starting at 20% with a top rate of 50%.

Without explicitly mentioning Thatcher&#x27;s sex, Callaghan was (as Christian Caryl later wrote) &quot;a master at sardonically implying that whatever the leader of the opposition said was made even sillier by the fact that it was said by a woman&quot;. Thatcher used the tactics that had defeated her other male opponents: constantly studying, sleeping only a few hours a night, and exploiting her femininity to appear as someone who understood housewives&#x27; household budgets.

A proposal for the two main party leaders to participate in two televised debates was put forward by former Labour MP turned broadcaster Brian Walden. These would have been produced by LWT and were planned to be shown on ITV on 22 &amp; 29 April 1979. While James Callaghan immediately accepted Walden&#x27;s proposal, Margaret Thatcher decided to &quot;wait a few days before replying&quot; to the invitation. According to &quot;The Glasgow Herald,&quot; Some of Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s advisers were concerned that she had more to lose from such debates, fearing that it would lead to a &quot;presidential-style &#x27;Her or me&#x27; campaign&quot; which would see policy issues become of less importance. However it was also reported that the danger of declining was that Mrs Thatcher would be charged by Labour as being &quot;scared&quot; to face the Prime Minister. At the insistence of the Liberals, their leader David Steel was also invited by LWT to take part, and accepted the offer. However, Mrs Thatcher declined the offer to take part, saying that the election was for a government, not a president, which meant that the debates did not go ahead.

==== Labour ====
The Labour campaign reiterated their support for the National Health Service and full employment and focused on the damage they believed the Conservatives would do to the country. In an early campaign broadcast, Callaghan asked: &quot;The question you will have to consider is whether we risk tearing everything up by the roots.&quot; Towards the end of Labour&#x27;s campaign, Callaghan claimed a Conservative government &quot;would sit back and just allow firms to go bankrupt and jobs to be lost in the middle of a world recession&quot; and that the Conservatives were &quot;too big a gamble to take&quot;.

The Labour Party manifesto, &quot;The Labour way is the better way&quot;, was issued on 6 April. Callaghan presented five priorities:
#&quot;We must keep a curb on inflation and prices&quot;;
#&quot;We will carry forward the task of putting into practice the new framework to improve industrial relations that we have hammered out with the TUC&quot;;
#&quot;We give a high priority to working for a return to full employment&quot;;
#&quot;We are deeply concerned to enlarge people&#x27;s freedom&quot;; and
#&quot;We will use Britain&#x27;s influence to strengthen world peace and defeat world poverty&quot;

==== Conservatives ====
The Conservatives campaigned on economic issues, pledging to control inflation and to reduce the increasing power of the trade unions who supported mass strikes. They also employed the advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi who had created the &quot;Labour Isn&#x27;t Working&quot; poster.

The Conservative campaign was focused on gaining support from traditional Labour voters who had never voted Conservative before, first-time voters, and people who had voted Liberal in 1974. Thatcher&#x27;s advisers, Gordon Reece and Timothy Bell, co-ordinated their presentation with the editor of &quot;The Sun&quot;, Larry Lamb. &quot;The Sun&quot; printed a series of articles by disillusioned former Labour ministers (Reg Prentice, Richard Marsh, Lord George-Brown, Alfred Robens and Lord Chalfont) detailing why they had switched their support to Thatcher. She explicitly asked Labour voters for their support when she launched her campaign in Cardiff, claiming that Labour was now extreme. Choosing to start her campaign in the strongly Labour-supporting city was part of Thatcher&#x27;s strategy of appealing to skilled manual workers (NRS social group C2), whom both parties had previously seen as certain Labour voters; she thought that many of these would support her promises to reduce unions&#x27; power and enact the Right to Buy their homes. On 29 April the Conservatives held a massive rally in London for Conservative trade unionists. The &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; called it an &quot;astonishing rally&quot; which it likened to &quot;the razza-matazz of an American presidential-stye jamboree&quot; and stated &quot;Nothing quite like it has been seen before in a General Election in Britain.&quot; Several celebrities including Lulu, Molly Weir and Nigel Davenport appeared to support Thatcher and the Conservatives, while others like Eric Sykes and Les Dawson sent messages of support. It was also announced former Labour MP Eddie Griffiths was backing the Conservatives against his former party.

An analysis of the election result showed that the Conservatives gained an 11% swing among the skilled working class (the C2s) and a 9% swing amongst the unskilled working class (the DEs).

Thatcher&#x27;s stance on immigration in the late 1970s (following the vast immigration from Asian and African-Caribbean nations during the 1950s and 1960s) was perceived as part of a rising racist public discourse, As Leader of the Opposition, Thatcher believed that the National Front (NF) was winning over large numbers of Conservative voters with warnings against floods of immigrants. Her strategy was to undermine the NF narrative by acknowledging that many of its voters had serious concerns in need of addressing. The National Front had a relatively small following and did not win any seats in parliament.

Thatcher criticised Labour immigration policy in January 1978, with the goal of attracting voters away from the NF and to the Conservatives. Her rhetoric was followed by an increase in Conservative support at the expense of the NF. Critics on the left reacted by accusing her of pandering to racism. Sociologists Mark Mitchell and Dave Russell responded that Thatcher had been badly misinterpreted, arguing that race was never an important focus of Thatcherism. Throughout her premiership both major parties took similar positions on immigration policy, having in 1981 passed the British Nationality Act with bipartisan support. No policies aimed at restricting immigration were passed or proposed by her government, and the subject of race was never highlighted by Thatcher in any of her major speeches as prime minister. Although Thatcher had pledged to address concerns felt by NF voters including matters related to immigration and presided over a period of disaffected race relations early in her premiership, the Conservative Party under her leadership actively began reaching out to ethnic minority voters ahead of the 1983 general election.

The Conservative manifesto, drafted by Chris Patten and Adam Ridley and edited by Angus Maude, reflected Thatcher&#x27;s views and was issued on 11 April. It promised five major policies:
#&quot;to restore the health of our economic and social life, by controlling inflation and striking a fair balance between the rights and duties of the trade union movement&quot;;
#&quot;to restore incentives so that hard work pays, success is rewarded and genuine new jobs are created in an expanding economy&quot;;
#&quot;to uphold Parliament and the rule of law&quot;;
#&quot;to support family life, by helping people to become home-owners, raising the standards of their children&#x27;s education and concentrating welfare services on the effective support of the old, the sick, the disabled and those who are in real need&quot;; and
#&quot;to strengthen Britain&#x27;s defences and work with our allies to protect our interests in an increasingly threatening world&quot;.

== Results ==
In the end, the overall swing of 5.2% was the largest since 1945, and gave the Conservatives a workable majority of 43 for the country&#x27;s first female prime minister. The Conservative victory in 1979 also marked a change in government which would continue for 18 years, including the entire 1980s, until the Labour victory of 1997. It marked a period of political stability in the United Kingdom following four changes of government in the space of 15 years. Although the Conservatives would go on to win more seats under Thatcher in 1983 and 1987, and again under Boris Johnson in 2019, the Tories have never since matched the 43.9% of the popular vote they recorded in 1979. This also remains the most recent election in which the Tories won an overall majority from opposition.

The SNP saw a massive collapse in support, losing 9 of its 11 MPs. The Liberal Party had a disappointing election; its scandal-hit former leader Jeremy Thorpe lost his seat in North Devon to the Conservatives.
