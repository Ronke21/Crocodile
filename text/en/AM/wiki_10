<text>Blake&#x27;s 7 is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC. Four series of thirteen 50-minute episodes were broadcast on BBC1 between 1978 and 1981. It was created by Terry Nation, who also wrote the first series, produced by David Maloney (series 1–3) and Vere Lorrimer (series 4), and the script editor throughout its run was Chris Boucher, who wrote nine of its episodes. The main character for the first two series was Roj Blake, played by Gareth Thomas.

&quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; was broadcast in 25 other countries. It had a low budget but featured many tropes of space opera, such as spaceships, robots, galactic empires and aliens. Critical responses have been varied; some reviewers praised the programme for its dystopian themes, strong characterisation, ambiguous morality and pessimistic tone, as well as displaying an &quot;enormous sense of fun&quot;, but others have criticised its production values and dialogue, and accused it of lacking originality. It retains a sizeable and enthusiastic fan base, and was described in &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s 40-year retrospective as &quot;a bold show that wasn&#x27;t afraid to break formulas&quot;.

A limited range of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; merchandise was issued, and books, magazines and annuals published. The BBC released music and sound effects from the series, and several companies made &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; toys and models. Four video compilations were released between 1985 and 1990, and the entire programme was released in videocassette format starting 1991 and re-released during 1997, and as four DVD boxed sets between 2003 and 2006. The BBC produced two audio dramas during 1998 and 1999 that feature original cast members and broadcast by Radio 4. Although proposals for live-action and animated remakes have not been realised, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; has been revived with two series of audio dramas, a comedic short film, and a series of fan-made audio plays involving the original cast.

== Overview ==
Four series of thirteen 50-minute episodes were made, and first broadcast in the United Kingdom between January 1978 and December 1981 by BBC1.&lt;ref name=&quot;B7 Programme Guide/Prologue&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are set in the third century of the second calendar (this is mentioned in associated publicity material, not in the series) and at least 700 years in the future. &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;″s narrative concerns the exploits of political dissident Roj Blake, who leads a small group of rebels against the forces of the totalitarian Terran Federation that rules the Earth and many colonised planets. The Federation uses mass surveillance, brainwashing, and drug pacification to control its citizens. Blake was arrested, tried on false charges, and deported to a remote penal colony. &quot;&quot;, he and fellow prisoners Jenna Stannis, Vila Restal, and Kerr Avon break free and escape on a technologically advanced alien spacecraft, which its central computer &#x27;Zen&#x27; informs them is named &quot;Liberator&quot;. &quot;Liberator&quot;″s speed and weaponry are superior to Federation craft, and it also has a teleportation system that enables transport to the surface of planets. Blake and his crew begin a campaign to damage the Federation, but are pursued by Space Commander Travis—a Federation soldier—and Servalan, the Supreme Commander and later Federation President.&lt;ref name=&quot;B7 Programme Guide/Stories&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of the titular &quot;seven&quot; changes throughout the series. The initial group—Blake, Vila, Gan, Jenna, Avon, and Cally—included Zen as the seventh member. At the end of the first series, they capture a supercomputer named Orac. Gan is killed during the second series, after which Blake and Jenna disappear and are replaced by new characters Dayna and Tarrant. At the start of the fourth series, Cally dies and is replaced by Soolin. After the destruction of &quot;Liberator&quot;, the computer Zen is replaced by a new computer, Slave, on board their new commandeered ship &quot;Scorpio&quot;.

While Blake is an idealistic freedom fighter, his associates are petty crooks, smugglers and killers. Avon is a technological genius who, while apparently motivated by self-preservation and wealth, consistently acts to help others. When Blake is separated from his crew, Avon becomes commander. At first, Avon believes the Federation has been destroyed; he becomes tired of killing, and seeks rest. However, by the middle of the third series, Avon realises that the Federation is expanding again, faster than originally realised, and he resumes the fight. 

The BBC had originally planned to conclude &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; at the end of its third series, but a further series was commissioned unexpectedly following the broadcast of its final episode.
As a result, some changes to the programme&#x27;s format were inevitable, both in front of and behind the camera. These included the appointment of a new producer and the introduction of a new spacecraft, &quot;Scorpio&quot;, and new characters, Soolin and Slave.

&quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; was watched by approximately 10 million people in the UK and was broadcast in 25 other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;B7 Programme Guide/Back&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
=== Regular characters ===
* Roj Blake, played by Gareth Thomas (leader of the crew in series 1–2, guest appearances in series 3–4). Blake is a long-term political dissident who uses the &quot;Liberator&quot; to wage war on the Federation. He is passionately opposed to the Federation&#x27;s injustice and corruption, and he is prepared to accept loss of life in pursuit of its destruction. He thinks nothing of placing himself in danger to protect his crew or advance his cause. Although Blake is respected by many of his crew members, Avon accuses him of fanaticism and recklessness.&lt;ref name=&quot;B7 Programme Guide/OwnWords&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kerr Avon, played by Paul Darrow (series 1–4, leader of the crew in series 3–4). Avon is an electronics and computer expert who once attempted to steal 5 million credits from the Federation banking system. He distrusts emotion, and he attempts to pursue a code based on logic and reason. This frequently causes conflict with Blake. He becomes a reluctant rebel and, at times, he seems motivated by financial gain and shows his readiness to put companions in danger in order to protect himself. He has an ambiguous and sometimes playful relationship with Servalan. Avon appears in 51 of the series&#x27; 52 episodes, being absent only in the first episode, &quot;The Way Back&quot;.
* Vila Restal, played by Michael Keating (series 1–4). Vila is a skilled thief, lock-picker and conjurer and is usually reluctant to risk his life. His behaviour is often cowardly and, although other crew members regard him as tiresome, he has a high IQ. He has weaknesses for alcohol and women, and apparently talks to himself at times. Vila is the only character to appear in every episode of the series.
* Jenna Stannis, played by Sally Knyvette (series 1–2). Jenna is a former space smuggler and skilled pilot who becomes adept at piloting &quot;Liberator&quot;. She has a great deal of affection for Blake, and she is loyal to him once he gains her trust. In earlier episodes, Jenna often maintains her opinions stubbornly.
* Cally, played by Jan Chappell (series 1–3). Cally is an alien guerrilla fighter from the planet Auron. She is a telepath, like all of her people, who can transmit thoughts silently to others. She later develops mind-reading, telekinesis and precognition abilities, but she is also uniquely vulnerable to telepathic control by alien forces. Cally develops as the moral conscience of the group, especially for later episodes of series 2 and throughout series 3.
* Dayna Mellanby, played by Josette Simon (series 3–4). The daughter of former dissident Hal Mellanby, Dayna is an expert in weapons technology. She is adept at designing mechanized weapons but also appreciates the nobility of what she describes as more &#x27;primitive&#x27; combat. Brave and loyal, but at times reckless and naïve, she often successfully challenges men who are supposedly accomplished fighters. Her vendetta against Servalan (who murdered her father) motivates her to endorse Avon&#x27;s fighting of the Federation.
* Del Tarrant, played by Steven Pacey (series 3–4). Tarrant is an expert pilot who trained with the Federation before beginning illegal activities. He is ruthless and charming, and he often challenges Avon&#x27;s leadership. He also takes advantage of the cowardice of Vila, whom he bullies into performing his instructions.
* Olag Gan, played by David Jackson (series 1–2). Having killed the Federation guard who murdered his girlfriend, Gan has been implanted with an electronic &quot;limiter&quot; device which prevents him from ever killing again. However, he is courageous, strong, and dedicated to Blake&#x27;s cause.
* Soolin, played by Glynis Barber (series 4). Soolin is an expert gunfighter whose parents were murdered when she was a child on her home planet of Gauda Prime. She joins the group after she is betrayed by her partner Dorian. No-one can match her speed at drawing a gun. Soolin&#x27;s logical and cynical attitude proves an asset to her colleagues. On several occasions, her quick thinking and prescient actions save the crew from perishing, overpowering the assassin Cancer and surviving the Betafarl Conspiracy. Barber had also previously played the role of a Mutoid in series 1 (episode 9: &quot;Project Avalon&quot;).
* Orac, voiced by Derek Farr (first appearance) and Peter Tuddenham (series 2–4). Orac is a super-computer capable of reading any other computer&#x27;s data and built by an inventor named Ensor. It uses a component called a Tariel cell—a universal computer component—and can access information stored on any computer that uses one. It can also control other computers. Orac dislikes work that it considers unnecessary, enjoys gathering information and has delusions of grandeur.
* Zen, voiced by Peter Tuddenham (series 1–3). The main computer aboard &quot;Liberator&quot;, Zen controls the craft&#x27;s secondary systems, including the battle and guidance computers. It is susceptible to interference from outside influences, such as Orac. It is considered a character in its own right. It is rendered nonfunctional after &quot;Liberator&quot; is damaged by corrosive fluid particles, and is destroyed with the ship.
* Slave, voiced by Peter Tuddenham (series 4). Introduced during the fourth series, Slave was built and programmed by Dorian and is the master computer of Dorian&#x27;s ship, &quot;Scorpio&quot;. It has a cringing personality, frequently apologetic and obsequious, and addresses Avon as &#x27;master&#x27; and others as &#x27;sir&#x27; or &#x27;madam&#x27;.

=== Other recurring characters ===
* Supreme Commander Servalan/Commissioner Sleer, played by Jacqueline Pearce. Servalan began her service career as a cadet, and eventually becomes Supreme Commander of the Terran Federation. Her desire for power began at the age of eighteen when her lover abandoned her. Shortly before the Intergalactic War, Servalan conducted a military coup and installed herself as president. She is later overthrown herself and presumed killed, but survives and adopts the pseudonym of Commissioner Sleer. She conducts a campaign of drug-induced pacification in order to regain territory for the Federation and her own position of power. Servalan is determined to pursue the crew of the &quot;Liberator&quot; and win control of the ship and Orac for herself.
* Space Commander Travis, played by Stephen Greif (first series) and Brian Croucher (second series). Travis is a dedicated and ruthless Federation officer, with the rank of Space Commander. His left eye and arm were destroyed by Blake, and replaced with an eye patch and a prosthetic arm fitted with a concealed weapon. Travis is known for treating his troops well and leading them personally, but also for his ruthlessness and contempt for human life. After his trial and conviction for killing civilians, Travis becomes increasingly obsessed with killing Blake.

== Sources and themes ==
Series creator Terry Nation pitched &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; to the BBC as &quot;&quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; in space&quot;, a reference to the 1967 Robert Aldrich movie in which a disparate group of convicts are sent on a suicide mission during World War II.
This influence shows in that some of Blake&#x27;s devotees are escaped convicts (Avon, Vila, Gan and Jenna). &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; also draws much of its inspiration from the legend of Robin Hood.
Blake&#x27;s devotees are not a band of &quot;Merry Men&quot;. His diverse crew includes a corrupt computer genius (Avon), a smuggler (Jenna), a thief (Vila), a murderer (Gan), a telepathic guerrilla soldier (Cally), the Liberator&#x27;s computer (Zen) and another computer (Orac). Later additions were: a naïve weapons expert (Dayna), a mercenary (Tarrant), a gunslinger (Soolin) and the Scorpio&#x27;s computer (Slave). While Blake intends to use &quot;Liberator&quot; to strike against the Federation, the others are often reluctant soldiers—especially Avon. Blake and Avon&#x27;s clashes over the command represent a conflict between idealism and cynicism, emotion and rationality, and dreams and practicality.
Similar conflicts occur between other characters; the courage of Blake and Avon compared with Vila&#x27;s cowardice, or Avon and Jenna&#x27;s scepticism of Blake&#x27;s ideals compared with Gan&#x27;s unswerving loyalty, Blake&#x27;s mass murdering methods compared with Avon&#x27;s targeted and less destructive methods.

Script editor Chris Boucher, whose influence on the series increased as it progressed, was inspired by Latin American revolutionaries, especially Emiliano Zapata, in exploring Blake and his devotees&#x27; motives and the consequences of their actions.
This is most evident in the episode &quot;Star One&quot;, in which Blake must confront the reality that in achieving his goal of overthrowing the Federation, he will cause chaos and death for many innocent citizens. When Avon gains control of &quot;Liberator&quot;, after Blake&#x27;s disappearance after the events of &quot;Star One&quot;, he uses it to pursue his own agenda, such as avenging his lost love Anna Grant. Later, Avon realises that he cannot escape the Federation&#x27;s reach and that he must, like Blake, resist them. In this respect, by the end of the fourth series Avon has replaced Blake.

Classic films, such as the Western &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, were an important influence upon &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;. Chris Boucher incorporated lines from Westerns into the scripts, much to the delight of Paul Darrow, an enthusiast of the genre. The final episode, &quot;Blake&quot;, was inspired by &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; and &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;. &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; also drew inspiration from the classic British dystopian novels &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; by George Orwell, &quot;Brave New World&quot; by Aldous Huxley and &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot; by H. G. Wells. This is most evident in the nature of the Federation, whose methods of dealing with Blake in the first episode, &quot;The Way Back&quot;, including brainwashing and show trials. These are reminiscent of the way in which the USSR dealt with its dissidents.
Explorations of totalitarianism in the series are not confined to the Federation—totalitarian control through religion (&quot;Cygnus Alpha&quot;), genetics (&quot;The Web&quot;) and technology (&quot;Redemption&quot;) are also portrayed.
Such authoritarian dystopias are common in Terry Nation&#x27;s work, including his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; (1975).

Loyalty and trust are important themes of the series.
Avon is presented with several opportunities to abandon Blake. Many of Blake&#x27;s schemes require co-operation and expertise from others. Characters are often betrayed by family and friends, especially Avon, whose former lover Anna Grant is eventually revealed to be a Federation agent. The theme of loyalty and trust reaches its maximum during Blake and Avon&#x27;s final encounter in the last episode (&quot;Blake&quot;); Blake, by now very paranoid, has been masquerading as a bounty hunter collaborating with the Federation as a front for his activities in recruiting and testing potential allies in the struggle and this causes Avon and the others to suspect him when Tarrant accuses Blake of betraying them; an ironic miscommunication between Avon and Blake precipitates the disastrous events that conclude the episode.
If Blake and his crew represent Robin Hood and his Merry Men, then the Federation forces, personified by the obsessive, psychopathic Space Commander Travis and his superior, the beautiful but ruthless Supreme Commander Servalan, represent Guy of Gisbourne and the Sheriff of Nottingham.

A common theme of Nation&#x27;s science fiction is the depiction of post-apocalyptic societies, as in several of his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials, for example &quot;The Daleks&quot; (1963–64), &quot;Death to the Daleks&quot; (1974), &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Android Invasion&quot; (1975) and in his series &quot;Survivors&quot; (1975–77). Post-apocalyptic societies feature in several &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; episodes including &quot;Duel&quot;, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;City at the Edge of the World&quot; and &quot;Terminal&quot;. Although not explicitly stated, some publicity material for the series refers to the Federation as having developed after a nuclear holocaust on Earth. Noting the series&#x27;s distinctive aesthetic, an academic concluded: &quot;At its best, Blake&#x27;s 7 had a peculiar intensity all its own&quot;.

== Plot summary ==

The series is set in a future age of interstellar travel and concerns the exploits of a group of outlaws. Gareth Thomas played the eponymous character Roj Blake, a political dissident who is arrested, tried and convicted on false charges, and then deported from Earth to a prison planet. En route, he and two fellow prisoners, treated as expendable, are sent to board and investigate an abandoned alien spacecraft found drifting in space. They get the ship working, commandeer it, rescue two more prisoners, and are later joined by an alien guerrilla with telepathic abilities. In their attempts to stay ahead of their enemies and inspire others to rebel, they encounter a great variety of cultures on different planets, and are forced to confront human and alien threats. Blake&#x27;s group suffer losses and casualties, and recruit newer members to join them. They perform a campaign against the totalitarian Terran Federation until an intergalactic war occurs with aliens from the Andromeda galaxy. Blake disappears and Kerr Avon then leads the group. When their spacecraft is destroyed and another group member is killed, the survivors commandeer another craft (which they enhance with superior technology), and a secret base on a distant planet from which they continue their campaign. In the final episode, Avon finds Blake and, suspecting him of betraying the group, kills him. The group is then shot by Federation guards, who surround Avon in the final scene as shots are heard over the end credits.

=== Series One ===
Roj Blake, a worker of high social status classified as &quot;alpha-grade&quot;, lives in a domed city. Similar domes house most of the Earth&#x27;s population. Blake is approached by a group of political dissidents who take him outside the city to meet their leader, Bran Foster. According to Foster, Blake was once the leader of an influential group of political activists opposed to the Federation&#x27;s Earth Administration. Blake was arrested, brainwashed and coerced into making a confession denouncing the rebellion. His memory of those years was then blocked. Foster wants Blake to rejoin the dissidents. Suddenly, the meeting is interrupted by the arrival of Federation security forces, who shoot and kill the crowd of rebels. Blake, the only survivor, returns to the city, where he begins to remember his past. He is arrested, tried on false charges of child molestation and sentenced to deportation to the prison planet Cygnus Alpha.

Whilst awaiting deportation from Planet Earth, Blake meets thief Vila Restal and smuggler Jenna Stannis. On board the prison ship &quot;London&quot;, Blake meets convicted murderer Olag Gan and computer engineer and embezzler Kerr Avon. The &quot;London&quot; encounters a battle between two alien space fleets and the &quot;London&quot;″s crew plot a course to avoid the combat zone and continue their voyage. They encounter a strange alien craft, board it and attempt to salvage it but are thwarted by the alien ship&#x27;s defence mechanism. The commander of the &quot;London&quot; sends the expendable Blake, Avon, and Jenna across to the ship. Blake defeats the defence system when it tries to use memories he recently discovered were false. With Jenna as pilot, the three convicts escape in the alien craft.

Blake and his crew follow the &quot;London&quot; to Cygnus Alpha in their captured ship, which they have named &quot;Liberator&quot;. They retrieve Vila and Gan, while Blake leaves the other prisoners. Blake wants to use &quot;Liberator&quot; and its new crew to attack the Federation with the others, especially Avon, as reluctant followers. Blake&#x27;s first target is a communications station on the planet Saurian Major. Blake infiltrates the station and is assisted by Cally, a telepathic guerrilla soldier from the planet Auron. Blake invites Cally to join the crew. With this new arrival, and including &quot;Liberator&quot;″s computer, Zen, &quot;Liberator&quot; has a crew of seven.

As Blake&#x27;s attacks against the Federation become bolder, he has less success. Political pressure grows on the Administration with planetary commanders threatening to leave the Federation because of its inability to protect them from Blake&#x27;s attacks. Rumours abound about Blake&#x27;s heroism and other rebel groups use his name for their actions. Supreme Commander Servalan appoints Space Commander Travis, who has a vendetta against Blake, to eliminate Blake and capture &quot;Liberator&quot;. Servalan often co-opts Travis for her personal projects and uses Blake as a cover for her own activities. When Travis repeatedly fails to eliminate Blake, Servalan does not assign the task to another officer and does not use more resources to eliminate him.

Blake meets a man named Ensor and discovers a plot by Servalan and Travis to seize a powerful computer named Orac, which is capable of communicating with any computer that uses a component called a Tariel Cell. Blake&#x27;s crew suffers from radiation sickness but capture the device before Servalan arrives. Blake offers to perform the operation to save Ensor&#x27;s life aboard the &quot;Liberator&quot; but Ensor dies when the power cells for his artificial heart are depleted before they are able to reach &quot;Liberator&quot;. Aboard the ship, Orac predicts the craft&#x27;s destruction in the near future.

=== Series Two ===
The &quot;Liberator&quot; is recaptured by the people that built it and Orac&#x27;s prophecy is fulfilled when it destroys an identical space vehicle. Blake wants to attack the heart of the Federation and he targets the main computer control facility on Earth. Avon agrees to help on the condition that Blake gives him &quot;Liberator&quot; when the Federation has been destroyed. Blake, Avon, Vila and Gan reach the control facility and find an empty room. Travis reveals that the computer facility was secretly relocated years before and the old location was left as a decoy. Blake and his crew escape but Travis throws a grenade in the confined area and Gan is killed by falling rubble.

After Gan&#x27;s death, Blake considers the future of the rebellion, and Travis is convicted of war crimes by a Federation court martial at Space Command Headquarters aboard a space station. Blake decides to restore his group&#x27;s reputation and attacks the space station but Travis escapes and continues his vendetta against Blake. Blake seeks the new location of the computer control facility. He learns that it is named &quot;Star One&quot;. When &quot;Star One&quot; begins to malfunction, Servalan also becomes desperate to find its location. The facility&#x27;s failure causes many problems in the Federation. &quot;Star One&quot; controls a large defensive barrier that has prevented extra-galactic incursions. Blake discovers &quot;Star One&quot;″s location and finds that, with help from Travis, aliens from the Andromeda Galaxy have infiltrated it. Vila discovers a fleet of alien spacecraft beyond the barrier. Travis partially disables the barrier. Blake and his crew overcome the aliens at &quot;Star One&quot; and kill Travis but the gap in the barrier allows the aliens to invade. Jenna calls for help from the Federation, where Servalan has conducted a military coup, imposed martial law and declared herself President. Servalan dispatches the Federation&#x27;s battle fleets to repel the invaders, who begin to breach the barrier. With Blake badly wounded, &quot;Liberator&quot; by Avon&#x27;s direction, alone until Servalan&#x27;s battle fleets arrive, fights against the aliens.

=== Series Three ===

&quot;Liberator&quot; is severely damaged during the battle with the Andromedans, forcing the crew to abandon ship whilst Zen carries out repairs. The Federation defeats the alien invaders but the cost considerably reduces its influence in the galaxy. Blake and Jenna go missing and Avon becomes the new leader. Two new additions, weapons expert Dayna Mellanby and mercenary Del Tarrant, join the crew. Avon is less inclined than Blake to attack the Federation but Servalan realises that if she captures &quot;Liberator&quot;, the Federation will quickly restore its former power.

Servalan attempts to create clones of herself, but is thwarted when the embryos are destroyed. Avon decides to find the Federation agent who killed Anna Grant, his former lover. The group interrupts an attempt to eliminate Servalan and Avon discovers that Anna is alive and was previously a Federation agent named Bartolemew. Anna tries to shoot Avon in the back but Avon kills her and frees Servalan. Servalan lures Avon into a trap using a faked message from Blake. Servalan finally captures &quot;Liberator&quot; and maroons the crew on an artificial planet named Terminal but does not know that &quot;Liberator&quot; has been irreparably damaged after flying through a cloud of corrosive fluid particles. As Servalan leaves Terminal, the ship explodes and Servalan is apparently killed as she attempts to escape by teleporting away.

=== Series Four ===
Booby traps, set by Servalan in her underground complex on Terminal, explode and Cally is killed. Avon, Tarrant, Vila and Dayna escape with Orac and are rescued by Dorian, a salvage operator. Dorian takes the crew in his spacecraft, &quot;Scorpio&quot;, to his base on the planet Xenon, where they meet his partner, Soolin. Dorian plans to drain the crew&#x27;s life-force and take Orac but is foiled by Vila. Avon completes a new teleport system for &quot;Scorpio&quot; using the technology left behind by Dorian. Soolin joins the crew and they commandeer &quot;Scorpio&quot; and occupy the Xenon base. Avon gains control of Slave, &quot;Scorpio&quot;″s main computer.

The crew acquires an experimental new stardrive that vastly increases &quot;Scorpio&quot;″s speed, making it even faster than &quot;Liberator&quot;. The &quot;Scorpio&quot; crew become concerned about the speed at which the Federation is reclaiming its former territory and discover that Servalan survived the destruction of &quot;Liberator&quot;. Deposed as President of the Federation, she is using the pseudonym Commissioner Sleer and is enacting a pacification programme using a drug named Pylene-50. The &quot;Scorpio&quot; crew gain the formula for an antidote to Pylene-50 but this cannot reverse the drug&#x27;s effects. Avon finds a way to synthesise the antidote and the crew attempt to create an alliance between independent worlds to resist the Federation and get the resources and manpower to mass-produce the Pylene-50 antidote. One of the alliance members, Zukan, betrays the alliance to Servalan and detonates explosives on Xenon base, which is damaged and the &quot;Scorpio&quot; crew are forced to abandon it.

Avon tells the rest of the group that Orac has traced Blake to Gauda Prime, an agricultural planet. Blake is masquerading as a bounty hunter; his latest quarry is Arlen, whom he hopes to recruit for his rebellion. &quot;Scorpio&quot; approaches Gauda Prime and is attacked. The crew, except Tarrant, use the teleport to abandon the damaged craft. Slave is damaged, Tarrant remains aboard to pilot &quot;Scorpio&quot; and is injured during a crash landing. Blake arrives, rescues and takes Tarrant to his base and purportedly captures Tarrant as bounty. Tarrant thinks that Blake has betrayed the group and Blake lets Tarrant escape. Tarrant is nearly killed by Blake&#x27;s colleagues when Avon and his crew save him, giving credence to Tarrant&#x27;s accusation that Blake has betrayed them to the Federation. Becoming very suspicious of Blake, Avon kills him. Arlen reveals that she is a Federation officer and Federation guards arrive. Tarrant, Soolin, Vila, and Dayna are shot by Federation troops, who slowly surround Avon with their weapons pointed at him. Avon steps over Blake&#x27;s body, raises his gun and smiles. Shots are heard over the end credits.

== Production history ==

Terry Nation had the idea for &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; in a moment of inspiration during a pitch meeting with Ronnie Marsh, a BBC drama executive. Marsh was intrigued and immediately commissioned a pilot script. When he had seen the draft, Marsh approved &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; for full development. David Maloney, an experienced BBC director, was assigned to produce the series and Chris Boucher was engaged as script editor. Nation was commissioned to write the thirteen episodes. Boucher&#x27;s task was to expand and develop Nation&#x27;s first drafts into workable scripts, but this became increasingly difficult as Nation started running out of ideas. Meanwhile, Maloney was struggling with the low budget available given the need for action and special effects. Despite these challenges &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; was very popular, with some episodes exceeding ten million viewers. A second series was quickly commissioned.

The BBC engaged new writers for the subsequent series. It was decided that one of the regular characters should die, to demonstrate that Blake and his crew were not invincible. Gan, played by David Jackson, was chosen because Gan had been under-used and was the least popular character. Although ratings declined compared to the first series, the BBC commissioned a third. When Gareth Thomas and Sally Knyvette decided not to return, new characters were required so that the story could continue without its titular character. Suggestions for a replacement actor for Blake were rejected and Avon became more prominent in the story. New characters Del Tarrant, portrayed by Steven Pacey, and Dayna Mellanby, portrayed by Josette Simon, were introduced.

&quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; was not expected to be recommissioned after the third series and there was surprise when during 1980 a further series was announced as the third series ended. Bill Cotton, BBC Head of Television, had watched &quot;Terminal&quot; and enjoyed it greatly. He telephoned the presentation department and ordered them to make the announcement. As David Maloney was unavailable, Vere Lorrimer became the producer. He introduced new characters, a new spacecraft &quot;Scorpio&quot; and its computer Slave. Jan Chappell (who played Cally) decided that she did not want to return, and was replaced by Glynis Barber as Soolin.

Gareth Thomas made a final appearance as Blake and insisted that his character be killed in a definitive manner. Although the fourth series performed satisfactorily in the ratings, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; was not renewed again and the final episode had an ambiguous finale. Except for Blake, whose death was contractual, the characters were shown being attacked in such a way that their survival would have been possible had a fifth series been commissioned. The final episode, titled &quot;Blake&quot;, was broadcast on 21 December 1981.

Although Blake&#x27;s 7 never crossed over with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; during its initial run, Gareth Thomas was open to the idea as he was close friends with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; star Tom Baker, and the two wanted to be &#x27;briefly crossing paths&#x27; with one another before going their separate ways. Ultimately, the idea was scrapped.

== Filming locations ==
Interior spaceship sets and other indoor scenes were recorded on videotape at BBC Television Centre, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush in London. For indoor complexes, such as bases or command centre bunkers, filming often took place in local power plants and water turbine stations. Location shooting was also extensive with shooting occurring mostly in southern England. Notable location shots include episode eleven, of the first series, &quot;Bounty&quot;, where the production was filmed at Quex Park in Kent. The Waterloo Tower in Quex Park was ex-president Sarkoff&#x27;s residence in exile.

The series also used Betchworth Quarry as the surface of an alien planet and Wookey Hole Caves as the site of an alien mine. Additional location shooting took place at Black Park, New Forest, South Bank, Camden Town and Wembley Conference Centre.

== Music and sound effects ==
&quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;″s theme music was written by Australian composer Dudley Simpson, who had composed music for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for more than ten years. The same recording of Simpson&#x27;s theme was used for the beginning titles of all four series of the programme. For the fourth series, a new recording was made for the closing credits that used an easy listening-style arrangement. Simpson also provided the incidental music for all of the episodes except for the Series One episode &quot;Duel&quot; and the Series Two episode &quot;Gambit&quot;. &quot;Duel&quot; was directed by Douglas Camfield, who had a grudge against Simpson and refused to work with him, and so Camfield used library music. Elizabeth Parker provided the music and sound effects for &quot;Gambit&quot;. &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; made considerable use of audio effects that are described in the credits as &quot;special sound&quot;. Many electronically generated sound effects were used, ranging from foley-style effects for props including handguns, teleport sounds, spacecraft engines, flight console buttons and background atmospheres. The special sounds for &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; were provided by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop composers Richard Yeoman-Clark and Elizabeth Parker.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; received both positive and negative reviews. The fourth episode &quot;Time Squad&quot; review by Stanley Reynolds of &quot;The Times&quot; stated, &quot; ... nice to hear the youngsters holding their breath in anticipation of a little terror&quot;. Reynolds elaborated, &quot;Television science fiction has got too self-consciously jokey lately. It is also nice to have each episode complete within itself, while still carrying on the saga of Blake&#x27;s struggle against the 1984-ish Federation. But is that dark-haired telepathic alien girl, the latest addition to Blake&#x27;s outer-space merry men, going to spell love trouble for blonde Jenna? Maid Marian never had that trouble in Sherwood Forest.&quot;

In January 1998 Robert Hanks of &quot;The Independent&quot; compared the series&#x27; ethos to that of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He wrote &quot;If you wanted to sum up the relative position of Britain and America in this century — the ebbing away of the pink areas of the map, the fading of national self-confidence as Uncle Sam proceeded to colonise the globe with fizzy drinks and Hollywood — you could do it like this: they had &quot;Star Trek&quot;, we had &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; ... No &#x27;boldly going&#x27; here: instead, we got the boot stamping on a human face which George Orwell offered as a vision of humanity&#x27;s future in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Hanks concluded that &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; has acquired a credibility and popularity Terry Nation can never have expected ... I think it&#x27;s to do with the sheer crappiness of the series and the crappiness it attributes to the universe: it is science-fiction for the disillusioned and ironic — and that is what makes it so very British&quot;.

Gavin Collinson of the British Film Institute&#x27;s website Screenonline wrote &quot;The premise of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; held nothing remotely original. The outlaw group resisting a powerful and corrupt regime is an idea familiar from Robin Hood and beyond.&quot; He added &quot;&quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;″s triumph lay in its vivid characters, its tight, pacey plots and its satisfying realism...For arguably the first time since the 1950s Quatermass serials, the BBC had created a popular sci-fi/fantasy show along adult lines&quot;. His review concludes &quot;Ultimately, the one force the rebels could not overcome proved to be the BBC&#x27;s long-standing apathy towards science fiction. However, the bloody finale, in which Avon murders Blake, exemplified the programme&#x27;s strengths — fearless narratives, credible but surprising character development and an enormous sense of fun.&quot; In 2015 Tim Stanley of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described the series as &quot;oft-derided&quot; and &quot;gloriously low budget&quot; but &quot;a genuine classic&quot;. He added &quot;this was superior drama performed by consummate professionals who made it believable by being 100 per cent committed to the material. &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;&#x27;s sets and dresses were bright and gaudy but it was dark, dark melodrama.&quot; Stanley concluded &quot;&quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; can be read as a document of the Callaghan/Carter years with their piles of rubbish in the streets. Then along came Thatcher/Reagan and sci-fi turned hopeful again. Cue &quot;Star Wars&quot; and its childish universe of
Wookiees and Ewoks. Moral clarity returned. The budgets ballooned. But, for my money, it was nowhere near as interesting.&quot;

The Australian broadcaster and critic Clive James gave a negative appraisal, calling it &quot; ... classically awful British television SF ... no apostrophe in the title, no sense in the plot&quot;. He continued &quot;The depraved space queen Servalan ... could never quite bring herself to volatilize the dimly heroic Blake even when she had him square in the sights of her plasmatic spasm guns. The secret of Blake&#x27;s appeal, or Blakes appeal, for the otherwise infallibly fatale Servalan remained a mystery, like the actual wattage of light bulb on which the design of Blake&#x27;s spaceship, or Blakes spaceship, was plainly based&quot;. Screenwriter Nigel Kneale, whose work included &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; and other science fiction, was also critical. He described &quot;the very few bits I&#x27;ve seen&quot; as &quot;paralytically awful&quot;, saying that &quot;the dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling&quot;.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; deviates from the good-versus-evil dualism in &quot;Star Wars&quot;; &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s &#x27;feel-good&#x27; future; and the episodic structure of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; also influenced &quot;Hyperdrive&quot; and &quot;Aeon Flux&quot;. It has also been alleged to have influenced &quot;Farscape&quot; and &quot;Firefly&quot;, albeit Joss Whedon denied that it had been a conscious influence on the latter. 
Television playwright Dennis Potter&#x27;s final work &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot; was inspired by the show.

&quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; remains fairly well regarded. A poll of United States science-fiction writers, fans and critics for John Javna&#x27;s 1987 book &quot;The Best of Science Fiction&quot; placed the series 25th in popularity, despite then only having recently begun to be broadcast in the US.
A similar poll in Britain conducted for &quot;SFX magazine&quot; during 1999 put &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; at 16th place, with the magazine commenting that &quot;twenty years on, TV SF is still mapping the paths first explored by Terry Nation&#x27;s baby&quot;.
During 2005 &quot;SFX&quot; surveyed readers&#x27; top 50 British telefantasy shows of all time, and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; was placed at number four behind &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.
A similar poll conducted by &quot;TV Zone&quot; magazine during 2003 for the top 100 cult television programmes scored &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; 11th.

Dutch musician Arjen Anthony Lucassen was inspired by &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; in naming his side-project Star One.

In 2004 a 15-minute comedy short entitled &quot;Blake&#x27;s Junction 7&quot; debuted at several film festivals around the world. It was directed by Ben Gregor, written by Tim Plester, and featured Mackenzie Crook, Martin Freeman, Johnny Vegas, Mark Heap and Peter Tuddenham. This parody depicted the characters taking a break at the Newport Pagnell motorway service area. During 2006 the BBC produced a 30-minute documentary &quot;The Cult of... Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; that was first broadcast on 12 December on BBC Four, as part of a &quot;Science Fiction Britannia&quot; series.

== Planned revival ==
The revival of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; has been mooted for some years. Terry Nation raised the possibility on a number of occasions and proposed that a new series would be set some years after the existing one. Avon, living in exile like Napoleon on Elba, would be persuaded by a new group of rebels to resume the fight against the Federation.

=== Radio and audio ===

During 1998 &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; was broadcast again by the BBC by radio. &quot;The Sevenfold Crown&quot; was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 17 January 1998 as part of its &quot;Playhouse&quot; strand. The play was produced by Brian Lighthill and written by Barry Letts. Paul Darrow, Michael Keating, Steven Pacey, Peter Tuddenham and Jacqueline Pearce reprised their television roles, but Josette Simon and Glynis Barber were replaced by Angela Bruce as Dayna and Paula Wilcox as Soolin. The story was set during the fourth series between the episodes &quot;Stardrive&quot; and &quot;Animals&quot;. This was followed by &quot;The Syndeton Experiment&quot;, which featured the same cast, producer and writer and was broadcast as &quot;The Saturday Play&quot; on 10 April 1999 by BBC Radio 4. BBC Audiobooks released a CD of readings of Trevor Hoyle&#x27;s novelisations of episodes &quot;The Way Back&quot; read by Gareth Thomas and &quot;Cygnus Alpha&quot; read by Paul Darrow.

On 11 December 2006 B7 Productions announced that it had recorded a series of 36 five-minute &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; audio adventures, written by Ben Aaronovitch, Marc Platt and James Swallow. This featured Derek Riddell as Blake, Colin Salmon as Avon, Daniela Nardini as Servalan, Craig Kelly as Travis, Carrie Dobro as Jenna, Dean Harris as Vila, Owen Aaronovitch as Gan, Michael Praed, Doug Bradley and India Fisher. The new series was broadcast by BBC Radio 7 and repeated during mid-2010 as three one-hour episodes: &quot;Rebel&quot; (written by Ben Aaronovitch), &quot;Traitor&quot; (Marc Platt) and &quot;Liberator&quot; (James Swallow). B7 Productions also produced series of 30-minute prequel audio episodes named &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: The Early Years&quot;, which explored the earlier histories of the central characters.

During 2011 Big Finish Productions, under licence from B7 Productions, announced that it would be producing a series of audio dramas named &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: The Liberator Chronicles&quot;, which would be &quot; ... a series of exciting, character-driven tales that remain true to the original TV series. We&#x27;re aiming for authenticity—recreating the wonder of 1978 all over again!&quot; The company also said it would publish a series of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; novels at a rate of two per year. During January 2013 Big Finish released an initial full-cast audio production, Warship. This was followed during January 2014 with a series of six full-cast single-disc original stories, with a second series starting in November 2014.

Several individuals and companies have produced unofficial material based upon Blake&#x27;s 7. Alan Stevens, later of Magic Bullet Productions, produced three unofficial audio cassettes between 1991 and 1998: &quot;Travis: The Final Act&quot;, &quot;The Mark of Kane&quot; and &quot;The Logic of Empire&quot;. Stevens also produced a series of audio dramas named &quot;Kaldor City&quot;, created by Chris Boucher, which link the &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; universe into Boucher&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Robots of Death&quot; through the character Carnell (Scott Fredericks), whom Boucher created for the &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; episode &quot;Weapon&quot;.

=== Television ===
During April 2000 producer Andrew Mark Sewell announced that he had bought the rights to &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; from the estate of Terry Nation, and was planning to produce a TV movie set 20 years after the finale of the original series. During July 2003, Sewell announced that he, Paul Darrow and Simon Moorhead had formed a consortium called &#x27;B7 Enterprises&#x27; that had acquired the rights and was planning a television miniseries budgeted at between five and six million U.S. dollars. Darrow would play Avon and the series was to be televised during early 2005, depending on &quot; ... many factors, not least financing&quot;. Paul Darrow subsequently left the project during December 2003, citing &quot;artistic differences&quot;.

B7 Enterprises announced on 31 October 2005 that it had appointed Drew Kaza as non-executive chairman, and that it was working on two &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; projects. &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: Legacy&quot; was to be a two-part, three-hour mini-series, which would be written by Ben Aaronovitch and D. Dominic Devine. &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: The Animated Adventures&quot; was to be a 26-part children&#x27;s animated adventure series written by Aaronovitch, Andrew Cartmel, Marc Platt and James Swallow.
In an interview with &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, writer and producer Matthew Graham said that he had been involved in discussions to revive &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;. Graham&#x27;s concept was that a group of young rebels would rescue Avon, who had been kept cryogenically frozen by Servalan, and then roam the galaxy in a new ship named &quot;Liberator&quot;.

On 24 April 2008, television station Sky1 announced that it had commissioned two 60-minute scripts for a potential series, working alongside B7 Productions. On 4 August 2010, the station said it had decided not to commission the series. B7 Productions said the decision was &quot; ... obviously disappointing&quot;, but that the development process has resulted in the &quot; ... dynamic reinvention of this branded series&quot;. It said it was confident it would find another partner to develop a new version of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; for television.

During July 2012, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that a remake for US television networks was being developed by the independent studio Georgeville Television. The Syfy network announced on 22 August that Joe Pokaski would develop the script and Martin Campbell would direct the new remake.

On 9 April 2013, the BBC reported that a new series of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; would be broadcast by SyFy. Other media reported that a full-series order of thirteen episodes had been placed. Again, however, no new series materialised.

== Merchandise ==
Terry Nation had done well financially from commercial exploitation of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Daleks, and recognised the potential for merchandise related to &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;. Nation and his agent Roger Hancock discussed this with Ray Williams of BBC Merchandising in December 1976. By May 1977, twenty-seven items of merchandise had been proposed for release by companies including Palitoy, Letraset and Airfix. However, only a small quantity of these was ever made available.

A small number of toys and models were produced. During 1978, Corgi Toys produced a die-cast model of &quot;Liberator&quot; with a transparent rear globe. This was re-released the following year in silver with a model space shuttle, and in blue on its own. Also during 1979, Blue Box Toys produced three space vehicle toys that featured the series logo; however, these had never appeared in the television programme. Comet Miniatures produced a injection-moulded model kit of &quot;Liberator&quot; in 1989, which contained many parts. They also produced a two-inch, white metallic &quot;Liberator&quot; model, and a three-inch Federation trooper figure. A &quot;Scorpio&quot; clip gun, and &quot;Liberator&quot; and &quot;Scorpio&quot; teleport bracelets, were also produced.

The children&#x27;s programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; offered a cheaper home-made alternative to fans who wanted merchandise. In its 23 February 1978 show, presenter Lesley Judd demonstrated how to create a replica &quot;Liberator&quot; teleport bracelet from common household objects. This was followed on 6 June 1983, when presenter Janet Ellis demonstrated a similar method of making a replica &quot;Scorpio&quot; bracelet.

=== Music ===
The sheet music of the &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; theme was published by Chappell &amp; Co. Ltd during 1978 with a photograph of &quot;Liberator&quot; on the front cover. A stereo re-recording of Dudley Simpson&#x27;s theme music, in a markedly different arrangement to the original, was also released as a single, with &quot;The Federation March&quot; (a piece of incidental music from the episode &quot;Redemption&quot;) on the B-side. The &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; theme was also released on an album &quot;BBC Space Themes&quot;, and &quot;Liberator&quot; was featured on the album sleeve. Another version of the theme, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7 Disco&quot;, was recorded by Federation and released during 1979 on Beeb Records with a B-side unconnected with the series. Many of the sound effects from the series were released during 1981 as an album, &quot;BBC Sound Effects No. 26: Sci-Fi Sound Effects&quot;, and re-released later on CD as &quot;Essential Science Fiction Sound Effects Vol. 1&quot;.

=== Books and magazines ===
&quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; books were produced by various authors and publishers. The first was entitled &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, written by Trevor Hoyle and Terry Nation, and published during 1978 (novelising the first-series episodes &quot;The Way Back&quot;, &quot;Space Fall&quot;, &quot;Cygnus Alpha&quot; and &quot;Time Squad&quot;). Its US title was &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7 – Their First Adventure&quot;. Hoyle wrote two more books of the series: &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: Project Avalon&quot; (1979, novelising the episodes &quot;Seek–Locate–Destroy&quot;, &quot;Duel&quot;, &quot;Project Avalon&quot;, &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Orac&quot; from the first series) and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: Scorpio Attack&quot; (1981, novelising the episodes &quot;Rescue&quot;, &quot;Traitor&quot; and &quot;Stardrive&quot; from the fourth series). Publications continued to be issued after the series had ended. Tony Attwood&#x27;s &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: The Programme Guide&quot;, published by Target during 1982, is a factual overview of the series with a detailed episode guide, an encyclopedia, and interviews with the cast and writers. It was re-issued by Virgin Books during 1994. Attwood also wrote an original novel named &quot;Afterlife&quot;, which is set after the final episode and was published by Target during 1984. Another original novel, &quot;&quot; by Paul Darrow, told the story of Avon&#x27;s early years before he met Blake, and was published during 1989.

World Distributors produced &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7 Annuals&quot; for 1979, 1980 and 1981. These featured stories, games, artwork and articles about space. During October 1981 Marvel UK began publishing the monthly &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; magazine, which included a comic strip by Ian Kennedy as well as text stories, features and photographs. Twenty-five issues including two &#x27;specials&#x27; were published, until the magazine closed during August 1983. Marvel produced two &#x27;special&#x27; magazines during 1994 and 1995, with much of the content written by television historian Andrew Pixley and about how the series was made. Seven issues of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7 Poster Magazine&quot; were published between December 1994 and May 1995.

Several books offering insight and background information to &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; were produced, including &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: The Complete Guide&quot; by Adrian Rigelsford (Boxtree, 1995), &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: The Inside Story&quot; by Joe Nazzaro and Sheelagh Wells (Virgin, 1997), &quot;A History and Critical Analysis of Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; by John Kenneth Muir (McFarland and Company, 1999), and &quot;Liberation. The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; by Alan Stevens and Fiona Moore (Telos, 2003).

=== Home video releases ===
During 1985 BBC Video issued four compilation videocassettes containing highlights from the first three series edited into 2 hour features. The first released was &quot;The Beginning&quot;, containing excerpts from &quot;The Way Back&quot;, &quot;Spacefall&quot;, &quot;Cygnus Alpha&quot; and &quot;Time Squad&quot;. &quot;Duel&quot; was released in 1986 with highlights of &quot;Seek–Locate–Destroy&quot;, &quot;Duel&quot; and &quot;Project Avalon&quot;. During the same year &quot;Orac&quot; was released, containing excerpts from &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;Orac&quot; and &quot;Redemption&quot;. The first three tapes were available in both VHS and Betamax format. The final tape, &quot;The Aftermath,&quot; was released in Australia during 1986, with extracts from &quot;Aftermath&quot;, &quot;Powerplay&quot; and &quot;Sarcophagus&quot;. During 1990 all four tapes were re-released in the UK on VHS.&lt;ref name=&quot;B7 Programme Guide/Merchandise&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991 BBC Video released &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; in episodic order on 26 VHS cassettes with two episodes per tape. Canadian company BFS also released these in North America. During 1997 Fabulous Films company re-released these tapes in different packaging. The BBC and Fabulous Films planned to issue the series as four DVD box sets, but this was disrupted by conflicts with rights-holders B7 Enterprises. These issues were resolved and one series per year was released on region 2 DVD between 2003 and 2006. During 2007 Amazon sold a four-series box set, but a casualty of the difficulties with Blake&#x27;s 7 Enterprises was &quot;The Making of Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, a four-part documentary directed by Kevin Davies, intended originally as an extra feature with each DVD release. B7 Enterprises said they &quot; ... did not feel [the documentary] provided a proper tribute or fresh retrospective of the show&quot;.
The discs contained extra features including bloopers, out-takes, alternative scenes, voiceover commentaries, interviews and behind the scenes footage.

On 22 August 2024, the BBC announced it would be releasing &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: The Collection – Series 1&quot;, a Blu-ray box set containing the entire first series newly remastered for the release. The set contains bonus features previously seen on the DVD release of the show alongside brand new bonus material, such as optional updated special effects on all 13 episodes, a feature-length documentary detailing the making of the first series, rare convention footage and the previous unreleased &quot;The Making of Blake&#x27;s 7 documentary&quot; originally meant for the DVD release. The box set was released on 11 November 2024.

<doc id="66127" wikidata="Q451436" url="?curid=66127" title="Humbert I, Count of Savoy">
<text>Humbert I (; 9801047), better known as Humbert the White-Handed () or (), was the count of Savoy from 1032 until his death and the founder of the House of Savoy.

Of obscure origins, his service to the Holy Roman Emperors Henry II and Conrad II was rewarded with the counties of Maurienne and Aosta and lands in Valais, all at the expense of local bishops and archbishops; the territory came to be known as the county of Savoy.

==Biography==

===Family===
Humbert was the son of Amadeus, who may or may not have preceded him as count of Maurienne. His brother was Bishop Otto of Belley. Humbert is the progenitor of the dynasty known as the House of Savoy. The origins of this dynasty are unknown, but Humbert&#x27;s ancestors are variously said to have come from Saxony, Burgundy or Provence. Given Humbert&#x27;s close connections with Rudolf III of Burgundy, it is likely that his family was Burgundian, and was descended either from the dukes of Vienne, or from a Burgundian aristocratic family (such as the Guigonids, ancestors of the counts of Albon). It is also likely that Humbert was related to Ermengarde of Burgundy, second wife of Rudolf III.

Humbert initially held lands around Belley and in the county of Sermorens, before gaining lands in Aosta and Valais.

===Humbert and the empire===
After Rudolf III&#x27;s death (1032), Humbert I swore fealty to Emperor Conrad II. He supported Conrad II in his campaigns against Odo II, Count of Blois, and Aribert, Archbishop of Milan. In return, Conrad II appointed Humbert count of Savoy and granted him Maurienne, Chablais and perhaps Tarentaise. These imperial grants to a loyal supporter secured key passes through the Alps, controlling trade between Italy and Western Europe, which would be the core of Savoy power for centuries.

===Marriage and children===

Humbert married Ancelie (Auxilia or Ancilia). She may have been Ancilla of Aoste, the daughter of &quot;vir illustris&quot; Anselme of Aoste or Ancilla of Lenzburg, the daughter of the master of ceremonies of Burgundy. Alternatively, Ancilla may have been a daughter of Anselm and Aldiud, and thus a member of a northern Italian dynasty known as the Anselmids.
With his wife, Humbert had at least four sons:
#Amadeus I (died 1056), Count of Savoy, successor
#Aymon (died 1054 or 1055), Bishop of Sion
#Burchard (died 1068 or 1069), Archbishop of Lyon
#Otto (died c. 1057), Count of Savoy, successor of his brother

Some authors believe that he had additional sons.

===Death===

Humbert is often said to have died c. 1047/8 at Hermillon, a town in the Maurienne region of present-day Savoie, France. In the 21st century, it has been suggested that he died by 1042.

<doc id="66142" wikidata="Q185373" url="?curid=66142" title="List of Chinese monarchs">
<text>The Chinese monarchs were the rulers of China during Ancient and Imperial periods. The earliest rulers in traditional Chinese historiography are of mythological origin, and followed by the Xia dynasty of highly uncertain and contested historicity. During the subsequent Shang () and Zhou (1046–256 BCE) dynasties, rulers were referred to as &quot;Wang&quot; , meaning king. China was fully united for the first time by Qin Shi Huang (259–210 BCE), who established the first Imperial dynasty, adopting the title &quot;Huangdi&quot; (), meaning Emperor, which remained in use until the Imperial system&#x27;s fall in 1912.

At no point during Ancient or Imperial China was there a formalized means to confer legitimate succession between rulers. From the Zhou dynasty onwards, monarchs justified their reigns by claiming the Mandate of Heaven (; &quot;Tiānmìng&quot;). The mandate held that a ruler and their successors had permission from the heavens to rule as long as they did so effectively. It also declared a ruler the Son of Heaven (; &quot;Tiānzǐ&quot;), giving them the right to rule &quot;all under heaven&quot; (; &quot;Tiānxià&quot;). Given the Mandate&#x27;s subjective nature, rulers also utilized a variety of methods to retain support and justify their accession. This ranged from military enforcement, political patronage, establishing peace and solidity, institutional reform, and historical revisionism to legitimize the dissolution of previous dynasties and their own succession. For most of Imperial China, the &quot;wuxing&quot; (; &quot;Five Elements&quot;) philosophical scheme was also central to justify dynastic succession.

Most Chinese monarchs had many names. They were given a personal name (; &quot;Míngzi&quot;) at birth, but later referred to by a posthumous name (; &quot;Shìhào&quot;)—which memorialized their accomplishments or character—due to a cultural naming taboo. Most emperors of the Imperial period also received a temple name (; &quot;Miàohào&quot;), used to venerate them in ancestor worship. From the rule of Emperor Wu of Han (141–87 BCE) onwards, emperors also adopted one or several era names (; &quot;Niánhào&quot;), or &quot;reign mottos&quot;, to divide their rule by important events or accomplishments. Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1912) rulers are referred to solely by their era names, of which they only had one.

Apart from ethnic Han rulers, China was also ruled by various non-Han monarchs, including Jurchen, Khitan, Manchu, Mongol and Tangut and many others. To justify their reign, non-Han rulers sometimes aligned themselves with the Confucian sages or the &quot;Chakravarti&quot; of Chinese Buddhism. There are numerous lengthy periods where many competing kingdoms claimed the throne, many of whose legitimacy is still debated by scholars.

==Ancient China==
===Mythological rulers===
In traditional Chinese historiography, various models of mythological founding rulers exist. The relevancy of these figures to the earliest Chinese people is unknown, since most accounts of them were written from the Warring States period ( BCE) onwards. The sinologist Kwang-chih Chang has generalized the typical stages: &quot;the first period was populated by gods, the second by demigods/culture hero, and the third by the legendary kings.&quot; The primordial god Pangu is given by many texts as the earliest figure and is credited with forming the world by separating heaven and earth. Other gods include Nüwa, who repaired heaven; Hou Yi, a mythical archer; and Gonggong, a serpent-like water deity.

Demigod and hero rulers from hero myths—the largest group Chinese myths—are attributed the invention of specific items, practices or traditions. Among the more important of them are Fuxi, the inventor of hunting; Suiren, who invented fire; and Shennong, who invented both agriculture and medicine. The subsequent legendary kings began with the Yellow Emperor (), known as &quot;Huangdi&quot;, a major culture hero of Chinese civilization whose reign was considered exemplary. Succeeding rulers include some combination of Shaohao, Zhuanxu, Emperor Ku, Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun. Since the late Warring States onwards, early Chinese monarchs have traditionally been ground into the concept of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors; however, the chosen figures of this grouping varies considerably between sources. Generally, most accounts include at least Fuxi and Shennong among the Three Sovereigns as well as the Yellow Emperor, Yao and Shun among the Five Emperors.

===Xia dynasty===

The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors period was followed by the Xia dynasty in traditional historiography. Founded by Yu the Great, both the dynasty and its rulers are of highly uncertain and controversial historicity.

===Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE)===

Unlike the Xia, the Shang dynasty&#x27;s historicity is firmly established, due to written records on divination objects known as Oracle bones. The oldest such oracle bones date to the Late Shang (), during the reign of Wu Ding (1250–1192), putting the exact details of earlier rulers into doubt.

<text>Sir Richard John Hadlee (born 3 July 1951) is a New Zealand former cricketer. Hadlee is widely regarded as one of the greatest all-rounders in cricket history, and amongst the very finest fast bowlers.

Hadlee was appointed an MBE in the 1980 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List and knighted in the 1990 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List for services to cricket. He is a former chairman of the New Zealand board of selectors. In December 2002, he was chosen by Wisden as the second greatest Test bowler of all time. In March 2009, Hadlee was commemorated as one of the Twelve Local Heroes, and a bronze bust of him was unveiled outside the Christchurch Arts Centre.

On 3 April 2009, Hadlee was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He is the most prominent member of the Hadlee cricket playing family.

==Personal life==

Hadlee was born on 3 July 1951 at St Albans, Christchurch. His father Walter Hadlee, and two of his four brothers, Dayle and Barry, played cricket for New Zealand. His former wife Karen also played international cricket for New Zealand.

Having discovered that he had Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome six months after retiring, he had heart surgery in July 1991. Hadlee had the syndrome since birth and felt some of the effects like irregular heartbeat during his career. Hadlee continues to lead an active life and works with the Heart Foundation.

In June 2018, Hadlee was diagnosed with bowel cancer and underwent tumour removal surgery.

==Test career==

A bowling all-rounder, in an 86-Test career he took 431 wickets (at the time the world record), and was the first bowler to pass 400 wickets, with an average of 22.29, and made 3124 Test runs at 27.16, including two centuries and 15 fifties.

Hadlee is rated by many experts as the greatest exponent of bowling with the new ball. He was the master of (conventional) swing and was the original &quot;Sultan of Swing&quot;. Hadlee was seen as one of the finest fast bowlers of his time, despite the contemporaneous presence of Dennis Lillee, Imran Khan, Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner, Kapil Dev, Ian Botham, Wasim Akram and Malcolm Marshall among others.

As one of the four top all rounders of his time, the others being Imran Khan, Kapil Dev and Ian Botham, Hadlee had the best bowling average of the four, but the lowest batting average.

Born in Christchurch, Hadlee made his first class debut for Canterbury in 1971/72 and his Test match debut in 1973 – on both occasions, his first delivery was dispatched to the boundary. Hadlee was an inconsistent performer at Test level for several years; however a breakthrough performance against India in 1976 in which he took 11 wickets in a game resulting in a win by New Zealand cemented his place in the side. In 1978, Hadlee helped New Zealand to a historic first win over England by taking 6 for 26 in England&#x27;s second innings, bowling the visitors out for 64 chasing a target of 137.

In 1979/80, New Zealand faced the West Indies in a home Test series at a time when the West Indies were a formidable world cricket power. In the first Test in Dunedin New Zealand achieved a shock 1-wicket win, helped by Hadlee&#x27;s 11 wickets in the game. In the second Test, Hadlee scored his maiden Test century, helping New Zealand draw the Test and win the series 1–0. The result was the start of a 12-year unbeaten home record for New Zealand in Test match series. Hadlee was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket, in the 1980 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

A tour to England in 1983 saw New Zealand register their first ever Test win on English soil, at Headingley. The match was remarkable for Hadlee&#x27;s match return of 0 for 89, a very unusual occurrence in a New Zealand victory during his career. England eventually won the 4 Test series 3–1; however, Hadlee topped both batting and bowling averages for New Zealand in the series, and took his 200th Test wicket in the final Test at Nottingham. In the return Test series in New Zealand in 1984, New Zealand completed a remarkable three-day innings victory (including one day lost to rain) over England at Christchurch, in which England were dismissed for less than 100 in both of their innings. The match was also notable for Hadlee&#x27;s superb all-round performance – he took 8 wickets in the match, and scored a rapid-fire 99 in New Zealand&#x27;s only innings. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowling Rankings for the year 1984 (he retained it for the next 4 years, till 1988).

1985/86 was the beginning of a period in which Hadlee developed from a very good fast bowler to a truly great one. In New Zealand&#x27;s tour to Australia, an outstanding all-round performance helped destroy the home team in the first Test at Brisbane, beginning with a personal Test best 9 for 52 in Australia&#x27;s first innings. A batting effort of 54 (to complement a fine 188 by Martin Crowe) combined with 6 more wickets in Australia&#x27;s second innings, helped New Zealand to a crushing innings victory. Hadlee followed this up with 7 wickets in a loss in the second Test, and 11 wickets in a New Zealand victory in the third Test, giving his country their first series win on Australian soil and a personal haul of 33 wickets in 3 Tests. In the first Test of the return series in New Zealand, Hadlee took his 300th Test wicket by trapping Australian captain Allan Border LBW. The series was eventually won 2-1 by New Zealand by way of a victory in the third Test at Eden Park.

In 1986 Hadlee helped New Zealand to a 1–0 series win in England, their first over that country in England. Hadlee&#x27;s outstanding personal performance in the second Test at Nottingham (his county &#x27;home&#x27;) where he took 10 wickets and scored 68 in New Zealand&#x27;s first innings powered his team to victory. In this Test Hadlee, often a controversial character, added to this side of his reputation when he felled (and hospitalised) England wicketkeeper and Nottinghampshire teammate Bruce French with a nasty bouncer. During the New Zealand v West Indies Test at Christchurch in March 1987, Hadlee and captain Jeremy Coney had a disagreement in the dressing room prior to the game. It progressed to not talking to each other on the field, communicating through John Wright at mid-on.

In April 1987, New Zealand travelled to Sri Lanka where Hadlee recorded his second Test century. His 151 not out in the first Test helped New Zealand to save the game; however, the tour was cut short due to a bomb exploding near the New Zealand team&#x27;s hotel in Colombo. The terrorist bomb responsible for killing 113 civilians was planted by the Tamil Tigers separatist movement and was not thought to be directed at the touring New Zealand cricket team. Nonetheless, the team voted overwhelmingly to return home after that one Test of the scheduled three-Test tour.

Hadlee&#x27;s appetite for competition against Australia surfaced again in 1987/88, when in the third Test of a 3 match series in Australia he captured 10 wickets and nearly inspired New Zealand to an unlikely series-equalling victory. The Test ended with Australia&#x27;s number eleven batsman Michael Whitney surviving a torrid last over bowled by an exhausted Hadlee. A wicket in that over would have given New Zealand victory, and Hadlee a world record 374th Test wicket, breaking current holder Ian Botham&#x27;s record. In the following home series against England, the New Zealand public eagerly anticipated the wicket which would give Hadlee sole possession of the world record. However, Hadlee broke down injured on the first day of the first Test, and was forced to sit out the rest of the series. At an awards dinner at the end of the season, Australian commentator Richie Benaud, upon seeing Hadlee hobble up to the stage on crutches, said later that he thought Hadlee &quot;would never play cricket again.&quot;

However, after a successful rehabilitation, the next opportunity for Hadlee to claim the Test wicket world record was against India in India in 1988. After touring India in 1976 Hadlee, plagued by stomach troubles, had decided never to play cricket there again, however the opportunity to make history was too strong a lure to pass up. He duly captured the record, and his 374th Test wicket, in the first Test of the series. In the second Test a 10 wicket haul helped New Zealand to a rare Test win in India, although the series was eventually lost 2–1.

In a home series against India in 1989/90, Hadlee become the first bowler in history to take 400 Test wickets when he dismissed Sanjay Manjrekar in the second innings of the first Test on his home ground in Christchurch, while a group of Old Boys from his former school sang their school song. Shortly after helping New Zealand to another Test victory over Australia at Wellington by taking his 100th first class 5 wicket haul in an innings, Hadlee announced that he would be retiring after the upcoming tour to England.

Shortly before the second Test of the England series at Lord&#x27;s, the 1990 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours were announced and included Hadlee&#x27;s appointment as a Knight Bachelor, for services to cricket. Hadlee was not invested with his knighthood until 4 October 1990 after the end of his final Test match on 10 July 1990, although he became Sir Richard upon the publication date of the Honours List. Lt.-Col. Sir Maharajkumar Dr. Vijayananda Gajapathi Raju (better known as the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram or Vizzy) was the only other person to be knighted for services to cricket while an active Test cricketer, in 1936. Unlike Hadlee however, Vizzy&#x27;s knighthood was recognised for his administrative efforts, not his services to cricket as a player. (Alastair Cook was subsequently knighted in 2019 while still a full-time first-class player, but shortly after his final Test match.) Due to most knighted cricketers being batsmen, Hadlee liked to state he was the first bowler to receive a knighthood since Sir Francis Drake. Hadlee celebrated the achievement by scoring 86 in New Zealand&#x27;s first innings and winning the man of the match award. In the final Test of the series, Hadlee ended his Test career by taking 5 wickets in his final bowling performance, and taking a wicket with the final ball of his Test career.

When his father Walter was asked to vote, for the 2000 edition of Wisden, for his choice of the five cricketers of the 20th century, he included Richard, confessing it was &quot;embarrassing ... But there&#x27;s a job to be done. I will cite the bare facts.&quot; He had considered Dennis Lillee for his selection, but found Richard&#x27;s Test match performance put him marginally ahead. In total, Richard Hadlee received thirteen votes from the 100 electors, coming the equal tenth as player of the century.

==Nottinghamshire career==

For Nottinghamshire, on often overgrassed Trent Bridge pitches, he gained some analyses that are remarkable in an era of covered pitches, notably his eight for 22 against Surrey in 1984. He represented Nottinghamshire between 1978 and 1987, but played only three full seasons due to injuries and Test calls. However, his bowling figures for those three seasons were quite remarkable:
* 1981: 4252 balls, 231 maidens, 1564 runs, 105 wickets for 14.89 each.
* 1984: 4634 balls, 248 maidens, 1645 runs, 117 wickets for 14.05 each.
* 1987: 3408 balls, 186 maidens, 1154 runs, 97 wickets for 11.89 each (&quot;the lowest average since 1969&quot;).

In those three seasons he was voted the &quot;PCA Player of the Year&quot; by his peers of the Professional Cricketers&#x27; Association (PCA). He won The Cricket Society &quot;Wetherall Award for the Leading All-Rounder in English First-Class Cricket&quot; in 1982, 1984, 1986 and 1987.

In the 1984 county season, Hadlee completed a feat rare in the modern age by doing the county &#x27;double&#x27; – scoring 1000 runs and taking 100 wickets in the same season. Hadlee, and his immediate successor at Nottinghamshire Franklyn Stephenson, are the only two players to achieve this feat in English county cricket since the number of county games per season was reduced in 1969. The runs component of the double included Hadlee&#x27;s highest first class score, 210* in a victory over Middlesex at Lord&#x27;s. In 1987, his swan song, he narrowly missed the double as Nottinghamshire won the County Championship as they had in 1981. Hadlee&#x27;s contribution with ball and bat to both and their other triumphs was immense. They next won the championship in 2005 with fellow Kiwi Stephen Fleming in charge.

==Canterbury career==

Because of seasonal differences, Hadlee also played provincial cricket in New Zealand, representing Canterbury.

The now-demolished north stand of the earthquake-damaged AMI Stadium was named the Hadlee stand after both Richard Hadlee and other members of the Hadlee family who have made contributions to Canterbury and New Zealand cricket. The Chappell–Hadlee Trophy in which New Zealand and Australia regularly compete in one-day matches is named after the Chappell family of Australia and the Hadlee family of New Zealand.

Hadlee was also a competent association football player, playing for southern league team Rangers A.F.C. in Christchurch.

==Bowling style==

Hadlee was a right-arm pace bowler. Initially extremely fast as a young man, as the years progressed he shortened his run-up, gaining improved accuracy and considerable movement off the wicket and in the air. Perhaps his most potent delivery was the outswinger, which became his main weapon in the latter stages of his career.

The most influential person as Hadlee developed and through his career was Dennis Lillee, who he saw as the exemplar of the fast bowler. &quot;He was big, strong, fit, confident, aggressive, had marvelous skills, great technique, he intimidated the batsmen with sheer presence and of course he got you out!&quot; In tough situations in a game Hadlee would ask himself what Lillee would do in equivalent circumstances, and would strive to copy his determination. In his book &quot;Menace&quot;, Lillee believed that determination was the greatest contribution to his success. Of Hadlee he considers him super skillful, the first true professional he saw in tests with serial away swingers on off stump with the occasional inswinger or cutter, the odd bouncer and a very rare yorker.

His economical action was notable for his close approach to the wicket at the bowler&#x27;s end (to the point where he occasionally knocked the bails off in his approach), a line which meant he was able to trap many batsmen leg before wicket. He broke the Test-wicket taking record with his 374th wicket on 12 November 1988 in Bangalore, India. His 400th Test wicket was claimed on 4 February 1990, and with his final Test delivery, on 9 July 1990, he dismissed Devon Malcolm for a duck.

==Batting style==
Hadlee was an aggressive left-handed middle-order batsman. Though his record was not as strong against top international bowlers, he was effective at punishing lesser attacks. He finished his career scoring 15 Test fifties and two Test centuries, while for Nottinghamshire in 1984, 1986 and 1987 he averaged over 50 (only W.G. Grace and George Herbert Hirst have come comparably close to heading both batting and bowling averages in a season).

== The Sir Richard Hadlee Sports Trust ==

In August 1990, Hadlee established The Sir Richard Hadlee Sports Trust. It was opened to help sportsmen and women who were in situations of hardship to strive for success in their chosen sporting or cultural discipline. The criteria for the Sir Richard Hadlee Sports Trust are: the applicant must be under the age of 25, the applicant must be from the region of Canterbury New Zealand, the request for assistance is specifically for sporting or cultural purposes and applicant is disadvantaged, facing hardship or has special circumstances which prevent him or her from pursuing his or her sporting or cultural endeavors. The Sir Richard Hadlee Sports Trust relies on the generosity of the community, as well as its corporate sponsors CTV, Lion Nathan, Newstalk ZB, Pernod Ricard, Pope Print, PR South and Vbase.

==International record and awards==
* Hadlee became the first player to complete the double of scoring 1,000 runs and taking 100 wickets in ODI history
* He was the second fastest bowler to take five-wicket hauls in 25 Test matches, the fastest seamer to achieve this feat (62 matches) and the third fastest in terms of number of innings played
* He took a total of 36 five-wicket hauls in Test matches and five in ODIs, the former a record in Test cricket at the time of his retirement
* Hadlee produced the best single innings bowling figures by any fast bowler in the 20th century (9/52 in the 1st innings of the 1st Test match against Australia at The Gabba in 1985)

===Sporting awards===
Hadlee has received many awards throughout his career, including:
*Appointed MBE for services to New Zealand sport in 1980
*Awarded a Knighthood for services to cricket in 1990
*Winner of the Windsor Cup on 13 occasions, including 12 consecutive years, for the most meritorious bowling performance of the season

<text>Eric Haraldsson ( , ; c.930−954), nicknamed Bloodaxe ( , ) and Brother-Slayer (), was a Norwegian king. He ruled as King of Norway from 932 to 934, and twice as King of Northumbria: from 947 to 948, and again from 952 to 954.

==Sources==
Historians have reconstructed a narrative of Eric&#x27;s life and career from the scant available historical data. There is a distinction between contemporary or near contemporary sources for Eric&#x27;s period as ruler of Northumbria and the entirely saga-based sources that detail the life of Eric of Norway, a chieftain who ruled the Norwegian Westland in the 930s. Norse sources have identified the two as the same since the late 12th century, and while the subject is controversial, most historians have identified the two figures as the same since W. G. Collingwood&#x27;s article in 1901. This identification was rejected early in the 21st century by the historian Clare Downham, who has argued that later Norse writers synthesized the two Erics, possibly using English sources. This argument, though respected by other historians in the area, has not produced consensus.

Contemporary or near-contemporary sources include different recensions of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Eric&#x27;s coinage, the &quot;Life &quot;of St Cathróe, and possibly skaldic poetry. Such sources reproduce only a hazy image of Eric&#x27;s activities in Anglo-Saxon England.

Strikingly, Eric&#x27;s historical obscurity stands in sharp contrast to the wealth of legendary depictions in the kings&#x27; sagas, in which he takes part in the sagas of his father Harald Fairhair and his younger half-brother Haakon the Good. These include the late 12th-century Norwegian synoptics – &quot;Historia Norwegiæ &quot;(perhaps &quot;c&quot;. 1170), Theodoricus monachus&#x27; &quot;Historia de antiquitate regum Norwagiensium&quot; (&quot;c&quot;. 1180), and &quot;Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum&quot; (&quot;c&quot;. 1190) – and the later Icelandic kings&#x27; sagas &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; (&quot;c&quot;. 1200), &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; (&quot;c&quot;. 1225), the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; ascribed to Snorri Sturluson (&quot;c&quot;. 1230), &quot;Egils saga&quot; (1220–1240), and &quot;Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta&quot; (&quot;c&quot;. 1300). Exactly in what sense the Eric of the sagas may have been based on the historical Eric of Northumbria, and conversely, to what extent later evidence might be called upon to shed light on the historical figure, are matters which have inspired a variety of approaches and suggestions among generations of historians. Current opinion veers towards a more critical attitude towards the use of sagas as historical sources for the period before the 11th century, but conclusive answers cannot be offered.

==Epithet==
Eric&#x27;s soubriquet &quot;blóðøx&quot;, ‘Bloodaxe’ or &#x27;Bloody-axe&#x27;, is of uncertain origin and context. It is arguable whether its preservation in two &quot;lausavísur&quot; by Egill Skallagrímsson and a contemporary skald genuinely dates to the 10th century or had been inserted at some stage when Eric was becoming the focus of legend. There is no guarantee that it significantly predates the 12th-century narrative tradition, where it is first attached to him in &quot;Ágrip&quot; and in Latin translation as &quot;sanguinea securis&quot; in the &quot;Historia Norwegiæ.&quot; The sagas usually explain it as referring to Eric&#x27;s slaying of his half-brothers in a ruthless struggle to monopolise his rule over Norway; Theodoricus gives the similar nickname &quot;fratrum interfector&quot; (&quot;killer of brothers&quot; or &quot;brother-bane&quot;). &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;, on the other hand, ascribes it to Eric&#x27;s violent reputation as a Viking raider.

==Family background==

===Father===
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (MS E) describes Eric laconically as ‘Harold’s son’ (&quot;Haroldes sunu&quot;). In the early part of the 12th century, John of Worcester had reason to believe that Eric (&quot;Yrcus&quot;) was of royal Scandinavian stock (&quot;Danica stirpe progenitum&quot;, a phrase used earlier for the Hiberno-Norse ruler of Northumbria, Sihtric Cáech).

This appears to match with independent tradition from Norwegian synoptic histories and Icelandic sagas, which are explicit in identifying Eric of Northumbria as a son of the Norwegian king Harald (I) Fairhair. The skaldic poems ascribed to Egill Skallagrímsson may offer further reassurance that the sagas are on the right track, although doubts have been expressed about the date and integrity of the verses in the form in which they have survived. One of Egill&#x27;s &quot;lausavísur&quot; speaks of an encounter in England with a man of &quot;Harald&#x27;s line&quot; (&quot;Haralds áttar&quot;), while the &quot;Arinbjarnarkviða&quot; envisages a ruler at York (Jórvik) who is a descendant of Halfdán (&quot;Halfdanar&quot;) and of the Yngling dynasty (&quot;ynglings burar&quot;). If genuine, the latter identification would form the only direct clue in the contemporary record which might link Eric with the Norwegian dynasty.

Another Harald known from this period is Aralt mac Sitric (d. 940), king of Limerick, the probable father of Maccus and Gofraid. This may be relevant, since both these brothers and a certain Eric have been described as rulers of &#x27;the Isles&#x27; (Hebrides) (see below). In a letter addressed to Pope Boniface VIII, King Edward I (r. 1272–1307) remembered a certain Eric (&quot;Yricius&quot;) as having been a king of Scotland subject to the English king.

In the 19th century, a case had also been made for Harald Bluetooth King of Denmark (d. 985) as being Eric&#x27;s true father. J.M. Lappenberg and Charles Plummer, for instance, identified Eric with Harald&#x27;s son Hiring. The only authority for this son&#x27;s existence is Adam of Bremen, who in his &quot;Gesta&quot; (&quot;c&quot;. 1070) claims to cite the otherwise unknown &quot;Gesta Anglorum&quot; for a remarkable anecdote about Hiring&#x27;s foreign adventures: &quot;Harald sent his son Hiring to England with an army. When the latter had subjugated the island, he was in the end betrayed and killed by the Northumbrians.&quot; Even if Eric&#x27;s rise and fall had been the inspiration for the story, the names are not identical and Harald Bluetooth&#x27;s &quot;floruit&quot; does not sit well with Eric&#x27;s.

===A brother?===
In the account cited in the Latin text of the North Sagas entitled, &quot;Morte Rex Eilricus&quot; (The death of King Eirikr) which had been copied long ago from the annals of the lost York Chronicles, the author provides the details of the events leading to Eric (Eirikr or Eirik) Bloodaxe&#x27;s death &quot;fraudulently, treacherously betrayed by Earl Osulfus&quot; (Osulf, Earl of Bamburg) &quot;... was killed by Earl Maccus ... at the Battle of Steinmor ... and there fell Eirikr, with his sons and brothers and all his army ... and his brother Reginaldus [Latin for Ragnald or Ragnvald] ... His son was also known as: Henricus or Haericus [Latin form] and brother as Ragnald or Reginaldus [Latin form] ... together with his son Henricus&quot; whom the commentator Michael Wood in 1981 documentary TV series &quot;In Search of the Dark Ages&quot; (in the episode &quot;In Search of Eric Bloodaxe&quot;) identifies as &#x27;Harékr&#x27; (from the Latin &quot;Haeric&quot; or &quot;Henricus&quot; or &quot;Haericus&quot;) &quot;and brother Ragnald&quot; (from the Latin &quot;Reginaldus&quot;). Historians have been struck by the correspondence with these names in &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;, which says two of the kings who died with Eric in his final battle against Osulf (Olaf) were called Harékr and Ragnvald, although they are not identified as relatives there they certainly are identified as his son (&quot;cum filio&quot; – meaning: &#x27;with his son&#x27;) and his brother ( – meaning: &#x27;and [his] brother&#x27;) in the North Sagas.
===Mother and half-brothers (sagas)===
Further details on his family background are provided solely by the Icelandic and Norwegian sources of the 12th and 13th centuries, which are of limited and uncertain historical value and should therefore be treated with due circumspection. Harald &#x27;Fairhair&#x27; is usually portrayed as a polygamous and virile king, the number of his sons varying between 16 and 20. While Eric&#x27;s mother remains anonymous in the synoptic histories (&quot;Ágrip&quot;) and most of the Icelandic sagas, the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; (&quot;c&quot;. 1230) claims that she was Ragnhildr, daughter of Eric, king of (South) Jutland. The possibility that Harald had married a Danish princess may find some support in a skaldic stanza which is usually assigned to Þorbjörn Hornklofi&#x27;s &quot;Hrafnsmál&quot;, a eulogy on Harald&#x27;s deeds in the form of a conversation between a raven and valkyrie. It tells that Harald &quot;chose the lady from Denmark [&quot;konu danska&quot;] / broke with his Rogaland loves / and his lemans of Horthaland, / the maidens of Hálogaland / and of Hathaland eke.&quot; In the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;, it is preceded by another stanza which refers to the &quot;handmaidens of Ragnhildr&quot; (&quot;ambáttir Ragnhildar&quot;) as witnesses of the event. However, it is uncertain whether her name was already in the original composition, as another manuscript reading has the metrically regular &quot;ambáttir Danskar&quot;. The account of &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, which claims that Harald had enjoyed the company of eleven consorts before Ragnhildr, and that of &quot;Egils saga&quot; are at variance with the suggestion elsewhere that Eric was one of the oldest (&quot;Fagrskinna&quot;), if not the eldest son of Harald (&quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, &quot;Ágrip&quot;). Whatever one makes of the discrepancy, the sagas – including &quot;Heimskringla&quot; – are unanimous in making Haakon Eric&#x27;s younger half-brother and successor.

==Early career (sagas)==
According to &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and &quot;Egils saga&quot;, Eric spent much of his childhood in fosterage with the &quot;hersir&quot; Thórir son of Hróald. Of his adolescent years, a remarkable picture is painted in &quot;Heimskringla,&quot; which recounts that Eric, aged twelve and seemingly possessed of prodigious valour and strength, embarked on a career of international piracy: four years were spent harrying the Baltic coasts and those of Denmark, Frisia and Germany (&#x27;Saxland&#x27;); another four years those of Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France; and lastly, Lappland and Bjarmaland (in what is now northern Russia). Describing the last trip, &quot;Egils saga&quot; notes that Eric sailed up the Dvina River into the Russian hinterland of Permia, where he sacked the small trading port of Permina.

==Marriage==
The &quot;Life of St Cathróe of Metz&quot;, written &quot;c&quot;. 1000 at the latest and therefore of near contemporary value, has information about Eric and his wife. It relates that &quot;after keeping him for some time&quot;, the King of the Cumbrians conducted Cathróe to &quot;Loidam Civitatem&quot;, the boundary between the &quot;Normanni&quot; (&quot;Scandinavians&quot;) and the &quot;Cumbri&quot; (&quot;Britons&quot;):

And there he was received by a certain nobleman, Gunderic, by whom he was led to king &quot;Erichius&quot; in the town of York, because this king had as wife a relative of the godly Cathróe

Given what is known of Cathróe&#x27;s own background, this probably means that she was of British (&quot;Cumbrian&quot;) or Scottish descent. This contradicts to some extent later saga tradition. According to the early 13th century &quot;Egils saga&quot;, Eric&#x27;s consort at York was Gunnhild, the famous &quot;mother of kings&quot;. This account was constructed by the author of &quot;Egils saga&quot; using an earlier poem called &quot;Arinbjarnarkviða&quot; &quot;Lay of Arinbjörn&quot;, and this poem does not mention Gunnhild by name, implying therefore that the name was introduced by the author of &quot;Egils saga&quot;.

Saga tradition is, however, unanimous that Eric did cohabit with a woman named Gunnhild. Her name occurs in a handful of Egill&#x27;s &quot;lausavísur&quot;. The earliest saga, &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, describes her as the daughter of Gorm inn Gamli (‘the Old’), king of Denmark (and hence a sister of Harald Bluetooth). Most subsequent accounts name her father Ozur, nicknamed either Toti &quot;teat&quot; (&quot;Egils saga, Fagrskinna&quot;, &quot;Heimskringla&quot;) or lafskegg &quot;dangling beard&quot; (&quot;Ágrip&quot;, &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;), a man who hailed from the northern province of Hålogaland (&quot;Egils saga&quot;, &quot;Heimskringla&quot;). Icelandic hostility towards Gunnhild has been cited as a possible source for her dissociation from the Danish royal house.

There is no consensus on how to solve this problem. An early suggestion is that the name for the king in York in the &quot;Life &quot;of Cathróe has been erroneously supplanted for Eric&#x27;s predecessor Amlaíb Cuarán (Olaf Sihtricsson), whose (second) wife Dúnflaith was an Irishwoman. Recently, Clare Downham has suggested that &quot;Erichius&quot;, Eric of Northumbria, is not the same as Eric Bloodaxe. And there remains the possibility that he was not strictly monogamous, and the existence of two wives need not be mutually exclusive.

==King of Norway (sagas)==
The dominant theme of the sagas about Harald&#x27;s numerous sons is the struggle for the Norwegian throne, in particular the way it manifests itself in the careers of Haakon and his foil Eric. According to &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Harald had appointed his sons as client kings over the various districts of the kingdom, and intended Eric, his favourite son, to inherit the throne after his death. At strife with his half-brothers, Eric brutally killed Ragnvald (Rögnvaldr), ruler of Hadeland on his father&#x27;s orders, and Bjørn Farmann, ruler of Vestfold. Some texts maintain that towards the end of his life, Harald allowed Eric to reign together with him (&quot;Heimskringla&quot;, &quot;Ágrip&quot;, &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;)&quot;.&quot; When Harald died, Eric succeeded to the realm, slaughtered the combined forces of his half-brothers Olaf and Sigrød, and gained full control of Norway. At the time, however, Eric&#x27;s younger and most famous half-brother Haakon, often nicknamed &quot;Aðalsteinsfóstri&quot;, had been staying at the West-Saxon court, having been sent there to be reared as fosterson to King Æthelstan (r. 924–939). Eric&#x27;s rule was reputedly harsh and despotic and so he fell rapidly out of favour with the Norwegian nobility. At this propitious time, Haakon returned to Norway, found a nobility eager to accept him as king instead and ousted Eric, who fled to Britain. &quot;Heimskringla&quot; specifies that Haakon owed his success in large part to Sigurd, earl of Lade.

Determining the date and length of Eric&#x27;s reign (before and after his father&#x27;s death) is a challenging and perhaps impossible task based on the confused chronology of our late sources. It is also unfortunate that no contemporary or even near contemporary record survives for Eric&#x27;s short-lived rule in Norway, if it is historical at all.

==Jarls of Orkney (sagas)==
The Norse sagas differ in the way they treat the manner and route by which Eric first came to Britain after he was forced out of Norway. The synoptic histories offer the most concise accounts. Theodoricus goes straight for Eric&#x27;s arrival in England, his welcome there by King Æthelstan, his brief rule and his death soon afterwards. Similarly, the &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; makes him flee directly to England, where he was received by his half-brother Haakon, baptised and given charge of Northumbria by Æthelstan. When Eric&#x27;s rule became intolerable, he was driven out and slain on an expedition in Spain. &quot;Ágrip&quot; tells that he came to Denmark first. According to &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, it would have been his wife&#x27;s native country and hence a power base where he might have expected to muster some support, but the text makes no such claims.

However, later sagas greatly expand upon Eric&#x27;s activities in the interim between his reigns in Norway and Northumbria, claiming that he initially adopted a predatory lifestyle of raiding, whether or not he was aiming for a more political line of business in the longer run. The jarldom of Orkney, the former Viking base subjected and annexed by Eric&#x27;s father, came to loom large in these stages of the literary development. &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; (&quot;c&quot;. 1220) mentions his daughter Ragnhild and her marriage to an Orkney earl, here Hávard, but never describes Eric as actually stepping ashore. The &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, written &quot;c&quot;. 1200, does speak of his presence in Orkney and his alliance with the joint jarls Arnkel and Erland, sons of Torf-Einarr, but not until his rule in Northumbria was challenged by Olaf (Amlaíb Cuarán). However, a number of later sagas such as the &quot;Separate Saga of St. Olaf&quot; (&quot;c&quot;. 1225), &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, &quot;Egils saga&quot; and &quot;Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta&quot; assert that he sailed directly to Orkney, where he took the joint jarls into vassalage, collected forces and so set up a base which enabled him to organise several expeditions in overseas territory. Named targets include Ireland, the Hebrides, Scotland and England. Eric sealed the alliance by giving his daughter Ragnhild in marriage to the future earl of Orkney, Arnfinn, son of Thorfinn Turf-Einarsson.

==King of Northumbria==
It is when Eric gains the kingship in Northumbria that he finally steps more firmly into the historical limelight, even though the sources provide only scanty detail and present notorious problems of their own. The historical sources – e.g., versions A-F of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Historia regum&quot; and Roger of Wendover&#x27;s &quot;Historia Anglorum –&quot; tend to be reticent and the chronology is confused. However, the best chronological guideline appears to be that offered by the Worcester Chronicle, i.e., the D-text of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;.

The Northumbria on which he set foot was one which had been bitterly fought over between the West-Saxon kings and the Hiberno-Norse line of descendants from Ímair, kings of Dublin. The Northumbrians&#x27; own position in the middle of the struggle may have been complex and the outcome was variable, leading an unsympathetic historian like Henry of Huntingdon to judge harshly &quot;their usual faithlessness&quot; (&quot;solita infidelitas&quot;).

===Historical background ===

====Æthelstan====
In 927, having ejected Gofraid ua Ímair from York, King Æthelstan brought Northumbria under English control. His victory in the Battle of Brunanburh in 937, in which he and his half-brother Edmund defeated Gofraid&#x27;s son King Olaf (III) Guthfrithson of Dublin, seems to have had the effect of consolidating his power. This impression is borne out by royal charters issued towards the end of his reign, between 937 and 939, which style Æthelstan ruler over all Britain (e.g., or ).

====Edmund and the two Olafs====
However, Æthelstan died in 939 and his successor Edmund, only 18 years of age, was unable to retain control of Northumbria. In 939 or 940, almost as soon as Edmund had come to power, a new ruler of the Uí Ímair dynasty had made York his seat. From Irish annals it is known that Edmund&#x27;s old rival Olaf Guthfrithson left Dublin in 939 (&quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;), that in 940 his cousin, known in Ireland as Amlaíb Cuarán and in England as Olaf Sihtricsson, joined him in York (&quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, &quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot;) and that Olaf Guthfrithson died in 941 (&quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot;,&quot; Chronicon Scotorum&quot;), while the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (MS E) dates his death – incorrectly it seems – to 942. Amlaíb Cuarán succeeded him and did so with popular support, as the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (MS D) reports that in 941, &quot;the Northumbrians belied their pledges, and chose Olaf [i.e., Amlaíb Cuarán] from Ireland as their king.&quot; Amlaíb shared the throne with his nephew Ragnald (Rögnvaldr), son of Gofraid. There are indications that Wulfstan, Archbishop of York and a leading statesman in Northumbrian politics, played a key role in Amlaíb&#x27;s support, although he would later change his mind (see below). In 942 Edmund struck back with a recapture of Mercia and the Five Boroughs of Danelaw, which so impressed contemporaries that a poem was written in honour of the achievement and included in the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. In response, Amlaíb launched a successful raid on Tamworth (Mercia), probably sometime later that year. However, in 943, when Amlaíb had marched on to Leicester, one of the Boroughs, he and Wulfstan were besieged by Edmund and managed to escape only by a hair&#x27;s breadth. Peace negotiations followed later that year to the effect that Edmund accepted Amlaíb as an ally and as two northern sources add, ceded to him Northumbria as far south as Watling Street. Later, Edmund stood sponsor to him at baptism and to Ragnall at confirmation. In 944, however, Northumbria passed into West-Saxon hands again as Edmund drove out both Viking rulers. The chronicler Æthelweard is clearer on the point of agency, writing that it was Wulfstan and the ealdorman () of the Mercians who deposed these &#x27;deserters&#x27; – perhaps born again pagans – and forced them to submit to Edmund. The same year, Edmund raided Cumbria and entrusted it to Malcolm I of Scotland in exchange for support &quot;both on sea and on land&quot;. The Irish annals report that in 945, Amlaíb was back in Dublin and an anonymous ruler at York, possibly Ragnald (Rögnvaldr), died. Edmund was described as in one of his charters, but did not live long enough to enjoy his renewed hold on the northern zone. He was killed in 946.

===Eric&#x27;s first reign (947/8–948)===
When Eadred succeeded to the throne in 946, Northumbrian as well as Scottish loyalties had proved unstable, though nothing is known for certain of the ambitions of rival rulers at this stage. Eadred &quot;reduced all the land of Northumbria to his control; and the Scots granted him oaths that they would do all that he wanted.&quot; Moreover, in 947 he convened Archbishop Wulfstan and the Northumbrian witan at Tanshelf (now in Pontefract, West Yorkshire), on the boundary of the Humber (near an old Roman road), where they pledged their obedience to him. What perceived threat was being countered remains unclear, but English rule does not seem to have been very warmly received.

In any event, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; (MS D) notes that the Northumbrians soon violated their pledges and oaths (947) and records a definite outcome of their disloyalty in 948, by which time &quot;they had taken Eirik [&quot;Yryc&quot;] for their king&quot;. That year, King Eadred harshly punished the northern defectors by launching a destructive raid on Northumbria, which notably included burning the Ripon minster founded by St Wilfrid. Although Eadred&#x27;s forces had to sustain heavy losses in the Battle of Castleford (&quot;Ceaster forda&quot;) – near Tanshelf – as they returned southwards, Eadred managed to check his rival by promising the latter&#x27;s supporters even greater havoc if they did not desert Eric. The Northumbrians preferred to appease the English king, renounced Eric and paid compensation.

The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba records that shortly thereafter, in 948 or 949, Malcolm (I) of Scotland and Cumbria, at Constantine&#x27;s instigation, raided Northumbria as far south as the River Tees and returned with many cattle and captives. Marios Costambeys suggests that it &quot;may have been directed against, or mounted in favour of, Eirik, though the protagonist could just as easily have been Óláf Sihtricson.&quot;

===Eric&#x27;s second reign (952–954)===
Eric&#x27;s removal cleared the way for Amlaíb [Anlaf Cwiran], who having suffered defeat at Slane (Co. Meath, Ireland) in 947, returned to Northumbria and took the kingship, supposedly in 949, if the E-text is to be trusted. Eadred does not appear to have undertaken any significant action and may even have turned a blind eye on his brother&#x27;s godson, or so at least the silence of the sources appears to suggest.

The E-text reports, however, that in 952, &quot;the Northumbrians drove out King Olaf and accepted Eric, son of Harold.&quot; The Annals of Ulster for the same year report a victory of the &quot;foreigners&quot;, i.e., the Northmen or the Norse-Gaels, over &quot;the men of Scotland and the Welsh [&quot;Bretnu&quot;, i.e., Britons of Strathclyde] and the Saxons.&quot; Exactly what this succinct account may tell us of his second rise to power, if anything, is frustratingly unclear. He may have led the Viking forces in a second bid for the throne, or only returned from the sideline to exploit the ravages of defeat. His reign proved once again of a short duration, since in 954 (a date on which MSS D and E agree), the Northumbrians expelled him, too.

Clare Downham notes the existence of an otherwise unrecorded &quot;Eltangerht&quot;, whose coins were minted at York and date from about the same time, but nothing is known of him from other records.

===Archbishop Wulfstan and the charters===
The nature of Eric&#x27;s relationship with Archbishop Wulfstan, the leading Northumbrian churchman who played such a decisive role in Amlaíb&#x27;s career in the early 940s, remains tantalisingly unclear. One might assume that Wulfstan, given his political eminence, headed the Northumbrian party which elected Eric. It has likewise been suggested that Eadred&#x27;s punitive attack on the ancient minster of Ripon, which carried little military weight, was targeted at Wulfstan in particular. In what sense his deposition in 948 may have affected the relationship in later years is more open to speculation.

The witness lists of Anglo-Saxon charters, which reveal when or not Wulfstan attended Eadred&#x27;s court, in his own right or as a diplomat intermediating between two kings, have been used to provide a chronological framework for Wulfstan&#x27;s swerving loyalties. Between 938 and 941, that is roughly between the Battle of Brunanburh (937) and the recovery of the Five Boroughs (942), the archbishop did not attest any royal charters, but he began to do so during or after the negotiations of 942. What the charters reveal for Eric&#x27;s first reign is less clear-cut, but intermittent absence may explain gaps in the record for Wulfstan&#x27;s attestations in the turbulent years 947–948. Unfortunately, the critical period between 950 and 954 has produced comparatively few charters (owing perhaps to Eadred&#x27;s deteriorating health), but what little there is may be instructive. Wulfstan is still seen at court in 950, but of the five charters which were issued in 951, not one was attested by him, which once again may imply his backing of Amlaíb. Eric&#x27;s reign (952–954) is more obscure. We do know, however, that in 952, the same year that Eric began his second term at York, Wulfstan was arrested and stood on trial in &quot;Iudanbyrig&quot; (unknown) on account of several unspecified allegations which had been repeatedly brought before Eadred. Of the few charters surviving for 953, Wulfstan attests one and by 955, after Eric&#x27;s death, he was restored to office, but now with Dorchester rather than York as his episcopal seat. Clare Downham suggests that during this period, Wulfstan may have been pressured by King Eadred into relinquishing his support of Eric.

===Coinage===
Eric&#x27;s Northumbrian rule is also corroborated by numismatic evidence. As of 3 February 2009, 31 coins minted at York had been found which bear the inscription of his name. These can be divided into two distinct types of issue: N549, in which the moneyer&#x27;s name (reverse) is written horizontally and broken up in two, and N550, in which his name is inscribed around the edges and Eric&#x27;s name (obverse) accompanied by a sword symbol (image above on the right). The two principal moneyers, Ingalger and Radulf, who had also minted coins for Amlaíb, occur on both types. The two types may correspond to his two reigns, but it is not out of the question that both were issued during a single reign.

===&quot;Life&quot; of St Cathróe===
Eric&#x27;s sudden appearance in the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, first noted by the D-text, is a puzzling one, lacking any information as to how or why he emerged on the scene. As hinted above, the &quot;Life&quot; of the Scottish saint Cathróe of Metz, written by a cleric (Reimann) who claimed to have been a former pupil of the saint, may possibly shed some light on his background. St Cathróe, a Scottish saint with a Brythonic name, visited a certain King Eric (&quot;Erichus&quot;) in York as he proceeded southwards from his native Strathclyde and Cumbria to &quot;Loida civitas&quot;, sometimes identified as Leeds, on the boundary with Cumbria, ultimately intending to go to West France. This Eric was both settled and married, and may have been on good terms with his neighbours in the north-west, although the evidence is indirect and somewhat ambiguous: the saint claimed kinship not only with Eric&#x27;s wife but also with Dyfnwal (III) (d. 975), king of Strathclyde and Cumbria (&quot;Donevaldus, rex Cumbrorum&quot;), which may point to an alliance of some kind between the two rulers. Based on internal evidence for the saint&#x27;s itinerary, Cathróe&#x27;s stay is to be dated between 940 x 943, when Constantine (II) left the kingdom of Scotland to Malcolm (I), and 946, when Edmund was slain. The greatest obstacle to an identification of the Erics lies in the problem that the account would be difficult to square with the version of events presented by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and the assertion in royal charters that in 946, Edmund was still king of all Britain. It may be noted that the text&#x27;s chronology has likewise presented some difficulties concerning the political status of Dyfnwal in the story (see main article there).

===King of the Hebrides (&quot;Caithréim Chellacháin Chaisil&quot;)===
A further glimpse may be offered by the mid-12th-century Irish saga entitled &quot;Caithréim Chellacháin Chaisil&quot;, a text which was primarily designed to glorify the deeds of Cellachán mac Buadacháin (d. 954), king of Munster, and hence his descendants, the Clann Faílbe. In one of its poems, an &quot;Eric, King of the Islands&quot; (&quot;Éiric Righ na n-Innse&quot;), meaning ruler of the Hebrides, is described as having allied himself to Sitriuc mac Tuirgeis, king of Dublin. Although the &quot;Caithréim&quot; is hardly a work celebrated for its accuracy as a source of history, the distant memory of an Eric who ruled the Hebrides may not be fictitious. It may be a matter of coincidence that the next Vikings known to have ruled the Hebrides were also &#x27;sons of Harold&#x27;, Gofraid mac Arailt, &quot;ri Innsi Gall&quot; (d. 989), who was succeeded by his son Ragnall, &quot;rí na n-innsi&quot; (d. 1005), and probably Gofraid&#x27;s brother Maccus mac Arailt, who is accorded the title &quot;king of very many islands&quot; ().

==Death==
The &quot;Chronicle&quot; gives no explanation, but it seems as if the abdications of Amlaíb and Eric are described as essentially northern affairs, apparently without much (direct) West-Saxon intervention, let alone invasion. The historical accounts of Eric&#x27;s death point to more complex circumstances, but Northumbrian politics are to the fore. Following a report on the invasion of Scotland by William I in 1072, the &quot;Historia regum&quot; attributed to Symeon of Durham recalls that Eric was driven out and slain by one Maccus son of Onlaf. The &quot;Flores historiarum&quot; (early 13th century) by Roger of Wendover is thought to have relied on a northern source now lost to us when it adds the following details:

Stainmore, traditionally in Westmorland and administratively in Cumbria, lies in the main pass through the northern Pennines, the Stainmore Pass or Gap, which marks the boundary between Cumbria in the west and modern Durham in the east. It is here that the mountains are traversed by an old Roman road – more or less followed by the A66 today – leading from York to Catterick and north-westwards from Catterick (via Bowes, Stainmore, Brough, Appleby and Penrith) to Carlisle. Eric may therefore have followed by and large the same route that St Cathroé had taken, except in the opposite direction, possibly with Strathclyde or the Hebrides as his intended destination.

The &quot;comes&quot; Osulf who betrayed Eric was high-reeve of the northern half of Northumbria, centred on Bamburgh, roughly corresponding to the former kingdom of Bernicia. He clearly benefited from his murderous plot against Eric. The &quot;Historia regum&quot; says that the province of Northumbria was henceforward administered by earls and records the formal appointment of Osulf as earl of Northumbria the following year. Likewise, the early 12th century &quot;De primo Saxonum adventu&quot; notes that &quot;[f]irst of the earls after Erik, the last king whom the Northumbrians had, Osulf administered under King Eadred all the provinces of the Northumbrians.&quot;

By contrast, the identity of Eric&#x27;s slayer, the &quot;comes &quot;Maccus son of Anlaf, is unclear. His name may point to origins in a Norse-Gaelic family based in the Border country. While Anlaf (Middle Irish: &quot;Amlaíb&quot;, Old Norse: &quot;Óláfr&quot;) is a common Scandinavian and Norse-Gaelic name, Maccus, a Norse-Gaelic name of Middle Irish origin, is geographically more restricted and is particularly well attested in southern Scottish place-names. Based on Eric&#x27;s confrontation with his predecessor Óláfr in &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;, attempts have been made to connect Onlaf to Amlaíb Cuarán, but this must remain in the realm of speculation.

Eric&#x27;s death receives a grander treatment in the synoptic histories and sagas. &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;, apparently the &quot;Eiríksmál&quot; which it incorporates, and &quot;Heimskringla&quot; assert that Eric and five other kings died together in battle in an unnamed place in England. According to &quot;Ágrip&quot; and &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, Eric died on a foray in Spain after being forced out of Northumbria. Somewhat in line with the former version, earlier generations of scholars have envisaged the occasion of Eric&#x27;s death on Stainmore to have been a last stand in battle. The view was espoused by W.G. Collingwood and later still by Frank Stenton, who speculates that Eric might have attempted to regain the kingdom or was fighting off pursuers. Finnur Jónsson re-interprets the alternative tradition in a historical light by proposing that &quot;Span-&quot; &quot;Spain&quot; in &quot;Ágrip&quot; goes back to a scribal confusion for &quot;Stan&quot;-, which in turn would have referred to Stainmore (OE *&quot;Stan&quot;). Having thus ascribed a historical core to the body of Scandinavian material, he in turn interprets the event as a battle.

However, scholars today are usually less prepared to colour the sober records with details from the sagas, preferring to take the view that Eric was assassinated in exile. In sum then, it looks as if Eric, expelled and heading in a north-westerly direction (possibly in search of support), was about to cross over into Cumbria, when in a bid for power, his official Osulf had him killed through the agency of Maccus. Exactly what made this a betrayal (&quot;proditio&quot;) in the eyes of the 10th century chronicler or those of Roger of Wendover, is unclear. It is unknown whether Osulf was also behind Eric&#x27;s expulsion, despite being the main beneficiary, and whether he was expected to grant Eric safe passage and perhaps an escort to guide him safely through that part of Northumbria over which he (Osulf) had jurisdiction. It is equally obscure whether Maccus ambushed his victims, or was part of the escort, betraying them (&quot;fraudulenter&quot;) as soon as he saw the opportunity.

===&quot;Eiríksmál&quot;===
Towards the end of its portrait of Eric, &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; cites the &quot;Eiríksmál&quot; (&quot;Lay of Eric&quot;), an anonymous panegyric written in commemoration of Eric&#x27;s death and according to the saga&#x27;s introduction, commissioned by his widow Gunnhild. Except for a single stanza in the Edda, the skaldic poem is preserved nowhere else and what has survived may represent only the opening stanzas.

Cast as a dialogue between Bragi, Odin, and fallen heroes, it tells of Eric&#x27;s arrival in Valhöll, accompanied by five other kings, and his splendid welcome there by Odin and his entourage. Odin had eagerly awaited his coming because &quot;many lands [...] / with his sword he has reddened&quot; and on being asked why he had deprived Eric of such earthly glory, answers that &quot;the future is uncertain&quot;, since the grey wolf is always lying in wait. Eric is then greeted by the famous hero Sigmundr: &quot;Hail now, Eiríkr [...] / here you shall be welcome; / brave hero, enter the hall.&quot;

Some have argued that the language of the poem shows influence from Old English. However, on recently examining the poem, John McKinnell could find little trace of this. The (original) date of composition remains a matter of some debate: some argue that it was written shortly after Eric&#x27;s death, while others who regard the poem as an imitation of the &quot;Hákonarmál&quot; in honour of Haakon the Good prefer a date sometime after Haakon&#x27;s death, &quot;c&quot;. 961.

In spite of the decidedly pagan contents of the poem, Eric may have died a Christian, as some of the sagas suggest. There is no evidence for his religious beliefs, but if ever Eric was to be accepted and consecrated as king, probably with Wulfstan as king-maker, acceptance of the Christian faith would have been set as a condition to royal office. The impression is borne out by Wulfstan&#x27;s earlier removal of Amlaíb Cuarán and Ragnald on grounds that they had become, in Æthelweard&#x27;s words, &quot;deserti&quot; &quot;deserters&quot; (see above).

In support of this view, it has sometimes been suggested that the name of one &quot;Eiric rex Danorum&quot;, &quot;Eric king of the Danes&quot;, written into the Durham &quot;Liber Vitae&quot;, f. 55v., may represent Eric of York. However, this can now be safely rejected in favour of an identification with Eric Ejegod (r. 1095–1103), whose queen Bodil (&quot;Botild&quot;) occurs by name after him.

===Rey Cross===


On the north side of the A66 in Stainmore today stands the so-called Rey cross, also known as Rere Cross, though what survives is little more than a stump consisting of the socket and a fragment of the shaft. Before it was temporarily housed at the Bowes Museum in 1990 and moved to its present location, it stood on a mound of rock a little further west on the south side of the road – coordinates: . The two sides of the shaft once seem to have borne carvings, if that much can be concluded from John Speed&#x27;s supposed description in 1611. Based on stylistic observations made by W. G. Collingwood when certain features were apparently still visible, it has been described as an Anglo-Scandinavian cross, possibly of the 10th century. No burials have been found. All evidence seems to point to its use as a boundary marker (between Cumbria and Northumbria), much like the Legg&#x27;s cross (County Durham) on Dere Street. The name has been explained as deriving from Old Norse &quot;hreyrr&quot;, &quot;cairn&quot;, or &quot;boundary cairn&quot;. Towards the end of the 19th century, however, W. S. Calverley argued that whatever its function in later ages, crosses in those times were usually tombstones, whereas boundary crosses postdate the Conquest. In the absence of a churchyard, he tentatively links the erection of the Rey cross to the putative battle on Stainmore. Although he ultimately rejects the idea of a memorial stone for Eric as &quot;mere romance&quot;, W. G. Collingwood was less prepared to dismiss it out of hand: &quot;a romancer might be justified in fancying that the Rey cross was carved and set up by Northumbrian admirers of the once mighty and long famous last King of York.&quot; No further evidence has been adduced to support the suggestion.

==Reputation in the sagas==
The figure that Eric became in the Norse sagas is a heady mix of history, folklore, and political propaganda. He is usually portrayed as a larger-than-life Viking hero, whose powerful and violent performances bring him many short-term successes, but ultimately make him flawed and unpopular as a ruler and statesman. The &quot;Heimskringla&quot; describes Eric as &quot;a large and handsome man, strong and of great prowess, a great and victorious warrior&quot;, but also &quot;violent of disposition, cruel, gruff, and taciturn&quot;. The synoptic histories (Theodoricus, the &quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot;, and &quot;Ágrip&quot;) to some degree seek to excuse Eric&#x27;s cruelty and fall from favour with the Norwegian nobility by pointing out another weakness, that of his naive faith in the evil counsels of his wife.

===Conflict with Egill Skallagrimsson (&quot;Egils saga&quot;)===
One of the richest sagas to deal with Eric Bloodaxe and his affairs in England is &quot;Egils saga&quot;, which is also a rich if problematic source for skaldic poems surviving from the 10th century. It tells how at the instigation of his wife Gunnhild, King Eric became involved in a prolonged conflict with Egill Skallagrimsson, the well-known Icelander Viking and skald. The account seems designed to enhance Egill&#x27;s abilities as a warrior, wizard, and poet. The story can be summarised as follows.

Egill had killed Bárðr of Atley, one of the king&#x27;s retainers, thus making an enemy of Queen Gunnhild, who never forgave him and did everything within her power to take revenge. Gunnhild ordered her two brothers to kill Egil and Egill&#x27;s older brother Þórólfr, who had been on good terms with both her and the king before. However, this plan did not go well, as Egill easily killed the pair when they confronted him, greatly increasing the Queen&#x27;s thirst for revenge. All that happened shortly before the death of Harald Fairhair and King Eric&#x27;s killing of his brothers to secure his place on the throne. He then declared Egill an outlaw in Norway. Berg-Önundr gathered a company of men to capture Egill but was killed in his attempt to do so. Escaping from Norway, Egill killed Ragnald (Rögnvaldr Eirikssen), the king&#x27;s son, and then cursed his parents, setting a horse&#x27;s head on a pole (&quot;níðstöng&quot; or &quot;spite-post&quot;) and saying,

He set up the pole of spite in the cliff-face and left it standing; he faced the horse&#x27;s eyes on the land, and he rist runes upon the pole, and said all the formal words of the curse. (&quot;níð&quot; has been variously translated as &quot;scorn&quot;, &quot;spite&quot; or &quot;curse&quot;). Gunnhild also put a spell on Egill, which made him feel restless and depressed until they met again. The last encounter happened when Erik and Gunnhild were living in England. Egill was shipwrecked on a nearby shore and came before Eric, who sentenced him to death. But Egill composed a drápa in Eric&#x27;s praise in the dungeon during the night, and when he recited it in the morning, Eric gave him his freedom and forgave any vengeance or settlement for the killing of Ragnald.

<text>Haakon Haraldsson (c. 920–961), also Haakon the Good (Old Norse: &quot;Hákon góði&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;Håkon den gode&quot;) and Haakon Adalsteinfostre (Old Norse: &quot;Hákon Aðalsteinsfóstri&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;Håkon Adalsteinsfostre&quot;), was the king of Norway from 934 to 961. He was noted for his attempts to introduce Christianity into Norway.

==Early life==
Haakon is not mentioned in any narrative sources earlier than the late 12th century. According to this late saga tradition, Haakon was the youngest son of King Harald Fairhair and Thora Mosterstang. He was born on the Håkonshella peninsula in Hordaland. King Harald determined to remove his youngest son out of harm&#x27;s way and accordingly sent him to the court of King Æthelstan. Haakon was fostered by King Athelstan, as part of an agreement made by his father, for which reason Haakon was nicknamed &quot;Adalsteinfostre&quot;. According to the Sagas, Athelstan was tricked into fostering Haakon when Harald&#x27;s envoy used the custom of knésetja, whereby a child was formally adopted if it was set on the knees of the foster-parent. Becoming someone&#x27;s foster-parent reportedly meant that they were subordinate to the child&#x27;s parent.

Haakon is not mentioned in any contemporary Anglo-Saxon sources, and later historians of Athelstan, such as William of Malmesbury, make no reference to Haakon. According to Norwegian royal biographies from the late 12th century, the English court introduced him to the Christian religion. On the news of his father&#x27;s death, King Athelstan provided Haakon with ships and men for an expedition against his half-brother Eric Bloodaxe, who had been proclaimed king of Norway. &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; describes Haakon as an apostate who observed both pagan and Christian rites.

==Reign==
At his arrival back in Norway, Haakon gained the support of the landowners by promising to give up the rights of taxation claimed by his father over inherited real property. Eric Bloodaxe soon found himself deserted on all sides, and saved his own and his family&#x27;s lives by fleeing from the country. Eric fled to the Orkney Islands and later to the Kingdom of Jorvik, eventually meeting a violent death at Stainmore, Westmorland, in 954 along with his son, Haeric.

In 953, Haakon had to fight a fierce battle (&quot;Slaget på Blodeheia ved Avaldsnes&quot;) at Avaldsnes against the sons of Eric Bloodaxe (&quot;Eirikssønnene&quot;). Haakon won the battle, at which Eric&#x27;s son Guttorm died. One of Haakon&#x27;s most famous victories was the Battle of Rastarkalv (&quot;Slaget på Rastarkalv&quot;) near Frei in 955 at which Eric&#x27;s son, Gamle, died. By placing ten standards far apart along a low ridge, he gave the impression that his army was bigger than it actually was. He managed to fool Eric&#x27;s sons into believing that they were outnumbered. The Danes fled and were slaughtered by Haakon&#x27;s army. The sons of Eric returned in 957, with support from King Gorm the Old, King of Denmark, but were again defeated by Haakon&#x27;s effective army system.

Skaldic poems and the Icelandic sagas link the introduction of the leiðangr naval system in Norway to Haakon. Haakon may have emulated King Æthelstan&#x27;s naval system.

==Succession==
Three of the surviving sons of Eric Bloodaxe landed undetected on the coast of Hordaland in 961 and surprised the king at his residence in Fitjar. Haakon was mortally wounded at the Battle of Fitjar (&quot;Slaget ved Fitjar&quot;) after a final victory over Eric&#x27;s sons. The King&#x27;s arm was pierced by an arrow and he died later from his wounds. He was buried in the burial mound (&quot;Håkonshaugen&quot;) in the village of Seim in Lindås municipality in the county of Hordaland. Upon his death his court poet, Eyvindr skáldaspillir, composed a skaldic poem &quot;Hákonarmál&quot; about the fall of the King in battle and his reception into Valhalla.
After Haakon&#x27;s death, Harald Greycloak, the eldest surviving son of Eric Bloodaxe, ascended the throne as King Harald II, although he had little authority outside western Norway. Subsequently, the Norwegians were tormented by years of war. In 970, King Harald was tricked into coming to Denmark and killed in a plot planned by Haakon Sigurdsson, who had become an ally of King Harald Bluetooth.

<doc id="66152" wikidata="Q83483" url="?curid=66152" title="Sea urchin">
<text>Sea urchins or urchins () are typically spiny, globular animals, echinoderms in the class Echinoidea. About 950 species live on the seabed, inhabiting all oceans and depth zones from the intertidal to . Their tests (hard shells) are round and spiny, typically from across. Sea urchins move slowly, crawling with their tube feet, and sometimes pushing themselves with their spines. They feed primarily on algae but also eat slow-moving or sessile animals. Their predators include sharks, sea otters, starfish, wolf eels, and triggerfish.

Like all echinoderms, adult sea urchins have pentagonal symmetry with their pluteus larvae featuring bilateral (mirror) symmetry; The latter indicates that they belong to the Bilateria, along with chordates, arthropods, annelids and molluscs. Sea urchins are found in every ocean and in every climate, from the tropics to the polar regions, and inhabit marine benthic (sea bed) habitats, from rocky shores to hadal zone depths. The fossil record of the &quot;Echinoids&quot; dates from the Ordovician period, some 450 million years ago. The closest echinoderm relatives of the sea urchin are the sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea), which like them are deuterostomes, a clade that includes the chordates. (Sand dollars are a separate order in the sea urchin class Echinoidea.)

The animals have been studied since the 19th century as model organisms in developmental biology, as their embryos were easy to observe. That has continued with studies of their genomes because of their unusual fivefold symmetry and relationship to chordates. Species such as the slate pencil urchin are popular in aquaria, where they are useful for controlling algae. Fossil urchins have been used as protective amulets.

== Diversity ==
Sea urchins are members of the phylum Echinodermata, which also includes starfish, sea cucumbers, sand dollars, brittle stars, and crinoids. Like other echinoderms, they have five-fold symmetry (called pentamerism) and move by means of hundreds of tiny, transparent, adhesive &quot;tube feet&quot;. The symmetry is not obvious in the living animal, but is easily visible in the dried test.

Specifically, the term &quot;sea urchin&quot; refers to the &quot;regular echinoids&quot;, which are symmetrical and globular, and includes several different taxonomic groups, with two subclasses: Euechinoidea (&quot;modern&quot; sea urchins, including irregular ones) and Cidaroidea, or &quot;slate-pencil urchins&quot;, which have very thick, blunt spines, with algae and sponges growing on them. The &quot;irregular&quot; sea urchins are an infra-class inside the Euechinoidea, called Irregularia, and include Atelostomata and Neognathostomata. Irregular echinoids include flattened sand dollars, sea biscuits, and heart urchins.

Together with sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea), they make up the subphylum Echinozoa, which is characterized by a globoid shape without arms or projecting rays. Sea cucumbers and the irregular echinoids have secondarily evolved diverse shapes. Although many sea cucumbers have branched tentacles surrounding their oral openings, these have originated from modified tube feet and are not homologous to the arms of the crinoids, sea stars, and brittle stars.

== Description ==
Urchins typically range in size from , but the largest species can reach up to . They have a rigid, usually spherical body bearing moveable spines, which give the class the name &quot;Echinoidea&quot; (from the Greek &#x27;spine&#x27;). The name &quot;urchin&quot; is an old word for hedgehog, which sea urchins resemble; they have archaically been called sea hedgehogs. The name is derived from the Old French , from Latin (&#x27;hedgehog&#x27;).

Like other echinoderms, sea urchin early larvae have bilateral symmetry, but they develop five-fold symmetry as they mature. This is most apparent in the &quot;regular&quot; sea urchins, which have roughly spherical bodies with five equally sized parts radiating out from their central axes. The mouth is at the base of the animal and the anus at the top; the lower surface is described as &quot;oral&quot; and the upper surface as &quot;aboral&quot;.

Several sea urchins, however, including the sand dollars, are oval in shape, with distinct front and rear ends, giving them a degree of bilateral symmetry. In these urchins, the upper surface of the body is slightly domed, but the underside is flat, while the sides are devoid of tube feet. This &quot;irregular&quot; body form has evolved to allow the animals to burrow through sand or other soft materials.

== Systems ==
=== Musculoskeletal ===

The internal organs are enclosed in a hard shell or test composed of fused plates of calcium carbonate covered by a thin dermis and epidermis. The test is referred to as an endoskeleton rather than exoskeleton even though it encloses almost all of the urchin. This is because it is covered with a thin layer of muscle and skin; sea urchins also do not need to molt the way invertebrates with true exoskeletons do, instead the plates forming the test grow as the animal does.

The test is rigid, and divides into five ambulacral grooves separated by five wider interambulacral areas. Each of these ten longitudinal columns consists of two sets of plates (thus comprising 20 columns in total). The ambulacral plates have pairs of tiny holes through which the tube feet extend.

All of the plates are covered in rounded tubercles to which the spines are attached. The spines are used for defence and for locomotion and come in a variety of forms. The inner surface of the test is lined by peritoneum. Sea urchins convert aqueous carbon dioxide using a catalytic process involving nickel into the calcium carbonate portion of the test.

Most species have two series of spines, primary (long) and secondary (short), distributed over the surface of the body, with the shortest at the poles and the longest at the equator. The spines are usually hollow and cylindrical. Contraction of the muscular sheath that covers the test causes the spines to lean in one direction or another, while an inner sheath of collagen fibres can reversibly change from soft to rigid which can lock the spine in one position. Located among the spines are several types of pedicellaria, moveable stalked structures with jaws.

Sea urchins move by walking, using their many flexible tube feet in a way similar to that of starfish; regular sea urchins do not have any favourite walking direction. The tube feet protrude through pairs of pores in the test, and are operated by a water vascular system; this works through hydraulic pressure, allowing the sea urchin to pump water into and out of the tube feet. During locomotion, the tube feet are assisted by the spines which can be used for pushing the body along or to lift the test off the substrate. Movement is generally related to feeding, with the red sea urchin (&quot;Mesocentrotus franciscanus&quot;) managing about a day when there is ample food, and up to a day where there is not. An inverted sea urchin can right itself by progressively attaching and detaching its tube feet and manipulating its spines to roll its body upright. Some species bury themselves in soft sediment using their spines, and &quot;Paracentrotus lividus&quot; uses its jaws to burrow into soft rocks.

=== Feeding and digestion ===
The mouth lies in the centre of the oral surface in regular urchins, or towards one end in irregular urchins. It is surrounded by lips of softer tissue, with numerous small, embedded bony pieces. This area, called the peristome, also includes five pairs of modified tube feet and, in many species, five pairs of gills. The jaw apparatus consists of five strong arrow-shaped plates known as pyramids, the ventral surface of each of which has a toothband with a hard tooth pointing towards the centre of the mouth. Specialised muscles control the protrusion of the apparatus and the action of the teeth, and the animal can grasp, scrape, pull and tear. The structure of the mouth and teeth have been found to be so efficient at grasping and grinding that similar structures have been tested for use in mechanical applications.

On the upper surface of the test at the aboral pole is a membrane, the periproct, which surrounds the anus. The periproct contains a variable number of hard plates, five of which, the genital plates, contain the gonopores, and one is modified to contain the madreporite, which is used to balance the water vascular system.

The mouth of most sea urchins is made up of five calcium carbonate teeth or plates, with a fleshy, tongue-like structure within. The entire chewing organ is known as Aristotle&#x27;s lantern from Aristotle&#x27;s description in his &quot;History of Animals&quot; (translated by D&#x27;Arcy Thompson):

However, this has recently been proven to be a mistranslation. Aristotle&#x27;s lantern is actually referring to the whole shape of sea urchins, which look like the ancient lamps of Aristotle&#x27;s time.

Heart urchins are unusual in not having a lantern. Instead, the mouth is surrounded by cilia that pull strings of mucus containing food particles towards a series of grooves around the mouth.

The lantern, where present, surrounds both the mouth cavity and the pharynx. At the top of the lantern, the pharynx opens into the esophagus, which runs back down the outside of the lantern, to join the small intestine and a single caecum. The small intestine runs in a full circle around the inside of the test, before joining the large intestine, which completes another circuit in the opposite direction. From the large intestine, a rectum ascends towards the anus. Despite the names, the small and large intestines of sea urchins are in no way homologous to the similarly named structures in vertebrates.

Digestion occurs in the intestine, with the caecum producing further digestive enzymes. An additional tube, called the siphon, runs beside much of the intestine, opening into it at both ends. It may be involved in resorption of water from food.

=== Circulation and respiration ===
The water vascular system leads downwards from the madreporite through the slender stone canal to the ring canal, which encircles the oesophagus. Radial canals lead from here through each ambulacral area to terminate in a small tentacle that passes through the ambulacral plate near the aboral pole. Lateral canals lead from these radial canals, ending in ampullae. From here, two tubes pass through a pair of pores on the plate to terminate in the tube feet.

Sea urchins possess a hemal system with a complex network of vessels in the mesenteries around the gut, but little is known of the functioning of this system. However, the main circulatory fluid fills the general body cavity, or coelom. This coelomic fluid contains phagocytic coelomocytes, which move through the vascular and hemal systems and are involved in internal transport and gas exchange. The coelomocytes are an essential part of blood clotting, but also collect waste products and actively remove them from the body through the gills and tube feet.

Most sea urchins possess five pairs of external gills attached to the peristomial membrane around their mouths. These thin-walled projections of the body cavity are the main organs of respiration in those urchins that possess them. Fluid can be pumped through the gills&#x27; interiors by muscles associated with the lantern, but this does not provide a continuous flow, and occurs only when the animal is low in oxygen. Tube feet can also act as respiratory organs, and are the primary sites of gas exchange in heart urchins and sand dollars, both of which lack gills. The inside of each tube foot is divided by a septum which reduces diffusion between the incoming and outgoing streams of fluid.

=== Nervous system and senses ===
The nervous system of sea urchins has a relatively simple layout. With no true brain, the neural center is a large nerve ring encircling the mouth just inside the lantern. From the nerve ring, five nerves radiate underneath the radial canals of the water vascular system, and branch into numerous finer nerves to innervate the tube feet, spines, and pedicellariae.

Sea urchins are sensitive to touch, light, and chemicals. There are numerous sensitive cells in the epithelium, especially in the spines, pedicellaria and tube feet, and around the mouth. Although they do not have eyes or eye spots (except for diadematids, which can follow a threat with their spines), the entire body of most regular sea urchins might function as a compound eye. In general, sea urchins are negatively attracted to light, and seek to hide themselves in crevices or under objects. Most species, apart from pencil urchins, have statocysts in globular organs called spheridia. These are stalked structures and are located within the ambulacral areas; their function is to help in gravitational orientation.

== Life history ==

=== Reproduction ===
Sea urchins are dioecious, having separate male and female sexes, although no distinguishing features are visible externally. In addition to their role in reproduction, the gonads are also nutrient storing organs, and are made up of two main type of cells: germ cells, and somatic cells called nutritive phagocytes. Regular sea urchins have five gonads, lying underneath the interambulacral regions of the test, while the irregular forms mostly have four, with the hindmost gonad being absent; heart urchins have three or two. Each gonad has a single duct rising from the upper pole to open at a gonopore lying in one of the genital plates surrounding the anus. Some burrowing sand dollars have an elongated papilla that enables the liberation of gametes above the surface of the sediment. The gonads are lined with muscles underneath the peritoneum, and these allow the animal to squeeze its gametes through the duct and into the surrounding sea water, where fertilization takes place.

=== Development ===
During early development, the sea urchin embryo undergoes 10 cycles of cell division, resulting in a single epithelial layer enveloping the blastocoel. The embryo then begins gastrulation, a multipart process which dramatically rearranges its structure by invagination to produce the three germ layers, involving an epithelial-mesenchymal transition; primary mesenchyme cells move into the blastocoel and become mesoderm. It has been suggested that epithelial polarity together with planar cell polarity might be sufficient to drive gastrulation in sea urchins.

An unusual feature of sea urchin development is the replacement of the larva&#x27;s bilateral symmetry by the adult&#x27;s broadly fivefold symmetry. During cleavage, mesoderm and small micromeres are specified. At the end of gastrulation, cells of these two types form coelomic pouches. In the larval stages, the adult rudiment grows from the left coelomic pouch; after metamorphosis, that rudiment grows to become the adult. The animal-vegetal axis is established before the egg is fertilized. The oral-aboral axis is specified early in cleavage, and the left-right axis appears at the late gastrula stage.

=== Life cycle and development ===
In most cases, the female&#x27;s eggs float freely in the sea, but some species hold onto them with their spines, affording them a greater degree of protection. The unfertilized egg meets with the free-floating sperm released by males, and develops into a free-swimming blastula embryo in as few as 12 hours. Initially a simple ball of cells, the blastula soon transforms into a cone-shaped echinopluteus larva. In most species, this larva has 12 elongated arms lined with bands of cilia that capture food particles and transport them to the mouth. In a few species, the blastula contains supplies of nutrient yolk and lacks arms, since it has no need to feed.

Several months are needed for the larva to complete its development, the change into the adult form beginning with the formation of test plates in a juvenile rudiment which develops on the left side of the larva, its axis being perpendicular to that of the larva. Soon, the larva sinks to the bottom and metamorphoses into a juvenile urchin in as little as one hour. In some species, adults reach their maximum size in about five years. The purple urchin becomes sexually mature in two years and may live for twenty.

=== Longevity ===
Red sea urchins were originally thought to live 7 to 10 years but recent studies have shown that they can live for more than 100 years. Canadian red urchins have been found to be around 200 years old.

== Ecology ==

=== Trophic level ===
Sea urchins feed mainly on algae, so they are primarily herbivores, but can feed on sea cucumbers and a wide range of invertebrates, such as mussels, polychaetes, sponges, brittle stars, and crinoids, making them omnivores, consumers at a range of trophic levels.

=== Predators, parasites, and diseases ===
Mass mortality of sea urchins was first reported in the 1970s, but diseases in sea urchins had been little studied before the advent of aquaculture. In 1981, bacterial &quot;spotting disease&quot; caused almost complete mortality in juvenile &quot;Pseudocentrotus depressus&quot; and &quot;Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus&quot;, both cultivated in Japan; the disease recurred in succeeding years. It was divided into a cool-water &quot;spring&quot; disease and a hot-water &quot;summer&quot; form. Another condition, bald sea urchin disease, causes loss of spines and skin lesions and is believed to be bacterial in origin.

Adult sea urchins are usually well protected against most predators by their strong and sharp spines, which can be venomous in some species. The small urchin clingfish lives among the spines of urchins such as &quot;Diadema&quot;; juveniles feed on the pedicellariae and sphaeridia, adult males choose the tube feet and adult females move away to feed on shrimp eggs and molluscs.

Sea urchins are one of the favourite foods of many lobsters, crabs, triggerfish, California sheephead, sea otter and wolf eels (which specialise in sea urchins). All these animals carry particular adaptations (teeth, pincers, claws) and a strength that allow them to overcome the excellent protective features of sea urchins. Left unchecked by predators, urchins devastate their environments, creating what biologists call an urchin barren, devoid of macroalgae and associated fauna. Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem. Sea otters have re-entered British Columbia, dramatically improving coastal ecosystem health.

=== Anti-predator defences ===
The spines, long and sharp in some species, protect the urchin from predators. Some tropical sea urchins like Diadematidae, Echinothuriidae and Toxopneustidae have venomous spines. Other creatures also make use of these defences; crabs, shrimps and other organisms shelter among the spines, and often adopt the colouring of their host. Some crabs in the Dorippidae family carry sea urchins, starfish, sharp shells or other protective objects in their claws.

Pedicellariae are a good means of defense against ectoparasites, but not a panacea as some of them actually feed on it. The hemal system defends against endoparasites.

=== Range and habitat ===
Sea urchins are established in most seabed habitats from the intertidal downwards, at an extremely wide range of depths. Some species, such as &quot;Cidaris abyssicola&quot;, can live at depths of several kilometres. Many genera are found in only the abyssal zone, including many cidaroids, most of the genera in the Echinothuriidae family, and the &quot;cactus urchins&quot; &quot;Dermechinus&quot;. One of the deepest-living families is the Pourtalesiidae, strange bottle-shaped irregular sea urchins that live in only the hadal zone and have been collected as deep as 6850 metres beneath the surface in the Sunda Trench. Nevertheless, this makes sea urchin the class of echinoderms living the least deep, compared to brittle stars, starfish and crinoids that remain abundant below and sea cucumbers which have been recorded from .

Population densities vary by habitat, with more dense populations in barren areas as compared to kelp stands. Even in these barren areas, greatest densities are found in shallow water. Populations are generally found in deeper water if wave action is present. Densities decrease in winter when storms cause them to seek protection in cracks and around larger underwater structures. The shingle urchin (&quot;Colobocentrotus atratus&quot;), which lives on exposed shorelines, is particularly resistant to wave action. It is one of the few sea urchin that can survive many hours out of water.

Sea urchins can be found in all climates, from warm seas to polar oceans. The larvae of the polar sea urchin &quot;Sterechinus neumayeri&quot; have been found to use energy in metabolic processes twenty-five times more efficiently than do most other organisms. Despite their presence in nearly all the marine ecosystems, most species are found on temperate and tropical coasts, between the surface and some tens of meters deep, close to photosynthetic food sources.

== Evolution ==
=== Fossil history ===
The earliest echinoid fossils date to the Middle Ordovician period (&quot;circa&quot; 465 Mya). There is a rich fossil record, their hard tests made of calcite plates surviving in rocks from every period since then.
Spines are present in some well-preserved specimens, but usually only the test remains. Isolated spines are common as fossils. Some Jurassic and Cretaceous Cidaroida had very heavy, club-shaped spines.

Most fossil echinoids from the Paleozoic era are incomplete, consisting of isolated spines and small clusters of scattered plates from crushed individuals, mostly in Devonian and Carboniferous rocks. The shallow-water limestones from the Ordovician and Silurian periods of Estonia are famous for echinoids. Paleozoic echinoids probably inhabited relatively quiet waters. Because of their thin tests, they would certainly not have survived in the wave-battered coastal waters inhabited by many modern echinoids. Echinoids declined to near extinction at the end of the Paleozoic era, with just six species known from the Permian period. Only two lineages survived this period&#x27;s massive extinction and into the Triassic: the genus Miocidaris, which gave rise to modern cidaroida (pencil urchins), and the ancestor that gave rise to the euechinoids. By the upper Triassic, their numbers increased again. Cidaroids have changed very little since the Late Triassic, and are the only Paleozoic echinoid group to have survived.

The euechinoids diversified into new lineages in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and from them emerged the first irregular echinoids (the Atelostomata) during the early Jurassic.

Some echinoids, such as &quot;Micraster&quot; in the chalk of the Cretaceous period, serve as zone or index fossils. Because they are abundant and evolved rapidly, they enable geologists to date the surrounding rocks.

In the Paleogene and Neogene periods (&quot;circa&quot; 66 to 2.6 Mya), sand dollars (Clypeasteroida) arose. Their distinctive, flattened tests and tiny spines were adapted to life on or under loose sand in shallow water, and they are abundant as fossils in southern European limestones and sandstones.

=== Phylogeny ===
==== External ====
Echinoids are deuterostome animals, like the chordates. A 2014 analysis of 219 genes from all classes of echinoderms gives the following phylogenetic tree. Approximate dates of branching of major clades are shown in millions of years ago (mya).

==== Internal ====
The phylogeny of the sea urchins is as follows:

The phylogenetic study from 2022 presents a different topology of the Euechinoidea phylogenetic tree. Irregularia are sister group of Echinacea (including Salenioida) forming a common clade Carinacea, basal groups Aspidodiadematoida, Diadematoida, Echinothurioida, Micropygoida, and Pedinoida are comprised in a common basal clade Aulodonta.

== Relation to humans ==

=== Injuries ===

Sea urchin injuries are puncture wounds inflicted by the animal&#x27;s brittle, fragile spines.
These are a common source of injury to ocean swimmers, especially along coastal surfaces where coral with stationary sea urchins are present. Their stings vary in severity depending on the species. Their spines can be venomous or cause infection. Granuloma and staining of the skin from the natural dye inside the sea urchin can also occur. Breathing problems may indicate a serious reaction to toxins in the sea urchin. They inflict a painful wound when they penetrate human skin, but are not themselves dangerous if fully removed promptly; if left in the skin, further problems may occur.

=== Science ===
Sea urchins are traditional model organisms in developmental biology. This use originated in the 1800s, when their embryonic development became easily viewed by microscopy. The transparency of the urchin&#x27;s eggs enabled them to be used to observe that sperm cells actually fertilize ova. They continue to be used for embryonic studies, as prenatal development continues to seek testing for fatal diseases. Sea urchins are being used in longevity studies for comparison between the young and old of the species, particularly for their ability to regenerate tissue as needed. Scientists at the University of St Andrews have discovered a genetic sequence, the &#x27;2A&#x27; region, in sea urchins previously thought to have belonged only to viruses like foot-and-mouth disease virus. More recently, Eric H. Davidson and Roy John Britten argued for the use of urchins as a model organism due to their easy availability, high fecundity, and long lifespan. Beyond embryology, urchins provide an opportunity to research cis-regulatory elements. Oceanography has taken an interest in monitoring the health of urchins and their populations as a way to assess overall ocean acidification, temperatures, and ecological impacts.

The organism&#x27;s evolutionary placement and unique embryology with five-fold symmetry were the major arguments in the proposal to seek the sequencing of its genome. Importantly, urchins act as the closest living relative to chordates and thus are of interest for the light they can shed on the evolution of vertebrates. The genome of &quot;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&quot; was completed in 2006 and established homology between sea urchin and vertebrate immune system-related genes. Sea urchins code for at least 222 Toll-like receptor genes and over 200 genes related to the Nod-like-receptor family found in vertebrates. This increases its usefulness as a valuable model organism for studying the evolution of innate immunity. The sequencing also revealed that while some genes were thought to be limited to vertebrates, there were also innovations that have previously never been seen outside the chordate classification, such as immune transcription factors PU.1 and SPIB.

=== As food ===
The gonads of both male and female sea urchins, sometimes euphemized as sea urchin &quot;roe&quot; or &quot;corals&quot;, are culinary delicacies in many parts of the world, especially Japan. In Japan, sea urchin is known as , and its gonads (the only meaty, edible parts of the animal) can retail for as much as ¥40,000 ($360) per kilogram; they are served raw as sashimi or in sushi, with soy sauce and wasabi. Japan imports large quantities from the United States, South Korea, and other producers. Japan consumes 50,000 tons annually, amounting to over 80% of global production. Japanese demand for sea urchins has raised concerns about overfishing.

Sea urchins are commonly eaten stuffed with rice in the traditional &quot;oko-oko&quot; dish among the Sama-Bajau people of the Philippines. They were once foraged by coastal Malay communities of Singapore who call them . In New Zealand, &quot;Evechinus chloroticus&quot;, known as in Māori, is a delicacy, traditionally eaten raw. Though New Zealand fishermen would like to export them to Japan, their quality is too variable.

In Mediterranean cuisines, &quot;Paracentrotus lividus&quot; is often eaten raw, or with lemon, and known as on Italian menus where it is sometimes used in pasta sauces. It can also flavour omelettes, scrambled eggs, fish soup, mayonnaise, béchamel sauce for tartlets, the for a soufflé, or Hollandaise sauce to make a fish sauce. In the region of Marseille, sea urchin are commonly eaten in dedicated food festival called &quot;oursinade&quot;.

On the Pacific Coast of North America, &quot;Strongylocentrotus franciscanus&quot; was praised by Euell Gibbons; &quot;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&quot; is also eaten. Native Americans in California are also known to eat sea urchins. The coast of Southern California is known as a source of high quality , with divers picking sea urchin from kelp beds in depths as deep as 24 m/80 ft. As of 2013, the state was limiting the practice to 300 sea urchin diver licenses. Though the edible &quot;Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis&quot; is found in the North Atlantic, it is not widely eaten. However, sea urchins (called in Alutiiq) are commonly eaten by the Alaska Native population around Kodiak Island. It is commonly exported, mostly to Japan. In the West Indies, slate pencil urchins are eaten.

In Chilean cuisine, it is served raw with lemon, onions, and olive oil.

=== Aquaria ===
Some species of sea urchins, such as the slate pencil urchin (&quot;Eucidaris tribuloides&quot;), are commonly sold in aquarium stores. Some species are effective at controlling filamentous algae, and they make good additions to an invertebrate tank.

=== Folklore ===
A folk tradition in Denmark and southern England imagined sea urchin fossils to be thunderbolts, able to ward off harm by lightning or by witchcraft, as an apotropaic symbol. Another version supposed they were petrified eggs of snakes, able to protect against heart and liver disease, poisons, and injury in battle, and accordingly they were carried as amulets. These were, according to the legend, created by magic from foam made by the snakes at midsummer.

<text>The Festival of Britain was a national exhibition and fair that reached millions of visitors throughout the United Kingdom in the summer of 1951.

Labour Party cabinet member Herbert Morrison was the prime mover; in 1947 he started with the original plan to celebrate the centennial of the Great Exhibition of 1851. However, it was not to be another World Fair, for international themes were absent, as was the British Commonwealth. Instead, the 1951 festival focused entirely on Britain and its achievements; it was funded chiefly by the government, with a budget of £12 million. The Labour government was losing support and so the implicit goal of the festival was to give the people a feeling of successful recovery from the war&#x27;s devastation, as well as promoting British science, technology, industrial design, architecture and the arts.

The Festival&#x27;s centrepiece was in London on the South Bank of the Thames. There were events in Poplar (Architecture – Lansbury Estate), Battersea (the Festival Pleasure Gardens), South Kensington (Science) and Glasgow (Industrial Power). Festival celebrations took place in Cardiff, Stratford-upon-Avon, Bath, Perth, Bournemouth, York, Aldeburgh, Inverness, Cheltenham, Oxford, Norwich, Canterbury and elsewhere, and there were touring exhibitions by land and sea.

The Festival became a &quot;beacon for change&quot; that proved immensely popular with thousands of elite visitors and millions of ordinary citizens. It helped reshape British arts, crafts, designs and sports for a generation. Journalist Harry Hopkins highlights the widespread impact of the &quot;Festival style&quot;. They called it &quot;Contemporary&quot;. It was:

Historian Kenneth O. Morgan says the Festival was a &quot;triumphant success&quot; during which people:

==Conception and organisation==

The first idea for an exhibition in 1951 came from the Royal Society of Arts in 1943, which considered that an international exhibition should be held to commemorate the centenary of the 1851 Great Exhibition. In 1945, the government appointed a committee under Lord Ramsden to consider how exhibitions and fairs could promote exports. When the committee reported a year later, it was decided not to continue with the idea of an international exhibition because of its cost at a time when reconstruction was a high priority. Herbert Morrison took charge for the Labour government and decided instead to hold a series of displays about the arts, architecture, science, technology and industrial design, under the title &quot;Festival of Britain 1951&quot;. Morrison insisted there be no politics, explicit or implicit. As a result, Labour-sponsored programmes such as nationalisation, universal health care and working-class housing were excluded; instead, what was allowed was town planning, scientific progress, and all sorts of traditional and modern arts and crafts.

Much of London lay in ruins, and models of redevelopment were needed. The Festival was an attempt to give Britons a feeling of recovery and progress and to promote better-quality design in the rebuilding of British towns and cities. The Festival of Britain described itself as &quot;one united act of national reassessment, and one corporate reaffirmation of faith in the nation&#x27;s future.&quot; Gerald Barry, the Festival Director, described it as &quot;a tonic to the nation&quot;.

A Festival Council to advise the government was set up under General Lord Ismay. Responsibility for organisation devolved upon the Lord President of the Council, Herbert Morrison, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, who had been London County Council leader. He appointed a Great Exhibition Centenary Committee, consisting of civil servants, who were to define the framework of the Festival and to liaise between government departments and the festival organisation. In March 1948, a Festival Headquarters was set up, which was to be the nucleus of the Festival of Britain Office, a government department with its own budget. Festival projects in Northern Ireland were undertaken by the government of Northern Ireland.

Associated with the Festival of Britain Office were the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Council of Industrial Design, the British Film Institute and the National Book League. In addition, a Council for Architecture and a Council for Science and Technology were specially created to advise the Festival Organisation and a Committee of Christian Churches was set up to advise on religion. Government grants were made to the Arts Council, the Council of Industrial Design, the British Film Institute and the National Museum of Wales for work undertaken as part of the Festival.

Gerald Barry had operational charge. A long-time editor with left-leaning, middle-brow views, he was energetic and optimistic, with an eye for what would be popular, and a knack on how to motivate others. Unlike Morrison, Barry was not seen as a Labour ideologue. Barry selected the next rank, giving preference to young architects and designers who had collaborated on exhibitions for the wartime Ministry of Information. They thought along the same lines socially and aesthetically, as middle-class intellectuals with progressive sympathies. Thanks to Barry, a collegial sentiment prevailed that minimised stress and delay.

===Displays===
The arts were displayed in a series of country-wide musical and dramatic performances. Achievements in architecture were presented in a new neighbourhood, the Lansbury Estate, planned, built and occupied in the Poplar district of London.

The Festival&#x27;s centrepiece was the South Bank Exhibition, in the Waterloo area of London, which demonstrated the contribution made by British advances in science, technology and industrial design, displayed, in their practical and applied form, against a background representing the living, working world of the day.

There were other displays elsewhere, each intended to be complete in itself, yet each part of the one single conception. Festival Pleasure Gardens were set up in Battersea, about three miles up river from the South Bank. Heavy engineering was the subject of an Exhibition of Industrial Power in Glasgow. Certain aspects of science, which did not fall within the terms of reference of the South Bank Exhibition, were displayed in South Kensington. Linen technology and science in agriculture were exhibited in &quot;Farm and Factory&quot; in Belfast. A smaller exhibition of the South Bank story was put on in the Festival ship &quot;Campania&quot;, which toured the coast of Britain throughout the summer of 1951, and on land there was a travelling exhibition of industrial design.

London Transport ordered its first batch of 25 post-war RF single deck buses fitted with roof lights to provide a fleet of sight-seeing coaches for the festival.

The University of Brighton Design Archives have digitised many of the Design Council&#x27;s files relating to the planning of the festival.

==The South Bank Exhibition==

Construction of the South Bank site opened up a new public space, including a riverside walkway, where previously there had been warehouses and working-class housing. The layout of the South Bank site was intended to showcase the principles of urban design that would feature in the post-war rebuilding of London and the creation of the new towns. These included multiple levels of buildings, elevated walkways and avoidance of a street grid. Most of the South Bank buildings were International Modernist in style, little seen in Britain before the war.

The architecture and display of the South Bank Exhibition were planned by the Festival Office&#x27;s Exhibition Presentation Panel, whose members were:

*Gerald Barry, &quot;Director-General, Chairman&quot;
*Cecil Cooke, &quot;Director, Exhibitions, Deputy Chairman&quot;

*James Gardner
*James Holland
*M. Hartland Thomas, &quot;Council of Industrial Design&quot;
*Ralph Tubbs
*Peter Kneebone, &quot;Secretary&quot;

The theme of the Exhibition was devised by Ian Cox.

===Other features of the South Bank Exhibition===

====The Skylon====
An unusual cigar-shaped aluminium-clad steel tower supported by cables, the Skylon was the &quot;Vertical Feature&quot; that was an abiding symbol of the Festival of Britain. The base was nearly 15 metres (50 feet) from the ground, with the top nearly 90 metres (300 feet) high. The frame was clad in aluminium louvres lit from within at night. It was designed by Hidalgo Moya, Philip Powell and Felix Samuely, and fabricated by Painter Brothers of Hereford, England, between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge. It had a steel latticework frame, pointed at both ends and supported on cables slung between three steel beams. The partially constructed Skylon was rigged vertically, then grew taller &quot;in situ&quot;. The architects&#x27; design was made possible by the engineer Felix Samuely who, at the time, was a lecturer at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in Bedford Square, Bloomsbury. The Skylon was scrapped in 1952 on the orders of Winston Churchill, who saw it as a symbol of the preceding Labour government. It was demolished and sold for scrap after being toppled into the Thames.

====Royal Festival Hall====

Designed by Leslie Martin, Peter Moro and Robert Matthew from the LCC&#x27;s Architects&#x27; Department and built by Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts for London County Council. The foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Clement Attlee in 1949, on the site of the former Lion Brewery, built in 1837. Martin was 39 when he was appointed to lead the design team in late 1948. He designed the structure as an &#x27;egg in a box&#x27;, a term he used to describe the separation of the curved auditorium space from the surrounding building and the noise and vibration of the adjacent railway viaduct. Sir Thomas Beecham used similar imagery, calling the building a &quot;giant chicken coop&quot;. The building was officially opened on 3 May 1951. The inaugural concerts were conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent and Sir Adrian Boult. In April 1988 it was designated a Grade I listed building, the first post-war building to become thus protected.

====Minor features====
* The Festival Administration Building, by Maxwell Fry, Jane Drew and Edward Mills.

==Festival Pleasure Gardens==

The Festival Pleasure Gardens were created to present a lighter side of the Festival of Britain. They were erected in Battersea Park, a few miles from the South Bank Exhibition. Attractions included:

*An amusement park which would outlast the other entertainments. It included the Big Dipper and became the Battersea Fun Fair, staying open until the mid-1970s
*A miniature railway designed by Rowland Emett. It ran for 500 yards along the south of the gardens with a station near the south east entrance and another (with snack bar) at the western end of the line
*A &quot;West End&quot; Restaurant with a terrace overlooking the river and facing Cheyne Walk
*Foaming Fountains, later restored
*A wine garden surrounded by miniature pavilions
*A wet weather pavilion with a stage facing two ways so that performances could take place in the open air. It had murals designed by the film set designer Ferdinand Bellan
*An amphitheatre seating 1,250 people. The opening show featured the music hall star Lupino Lane and his company. It was later turned into a circus

The majority of the buildings and pavilions on the site were designed by John Piper. There was also a whimsical Guinness Festival Clock resembling a three dimensional version of a cartoon drawing. The Pleasure Gardens received as many visitors as the South Bank Festival. They were managed by a specially-formed private company financed by loans from the Festival Office and the London County Council. As the attractions failed to cover their costs, it was decided to keep them open after the rest of the Festival had closed.

==Aspects of the Festival==

===Architecture===
The Festival architects tried to show by the design and layout of the South Bank Festival what could be achieved by applying modern town planning ideas. The Festival Style, (also called &quot;Contemporary&quot;) combining modernism with whimsy and Englishness, influenced architecture, interior design, product design and typography in the 1950s. William Feaver describes the Festival Style as &quot;Braced legs, indoor plants, lily of the valley sprays of lightbulbs, aluminium lattices, Cotswold-type walling with picture windows, flying staircases, blond wood, the thorn, the spike, the molecule.&quot; The influence of the Festival Style was felt in the new towns, coffee bars and office blocks of the fifties. Harlow new town and the rebuilding of Coventry city centre are said to show the influence of the Festival Style &quot;in their light structures, picturesque layout and incorporation of works of art&quot;, and Coventry Cathedral (1962), designed by Basil Spence, one of the Festival architects, was dubbed &quot;The Festival of Britain at Prayer&quot;.
There was an exhibition about building research, town planning and architecture, the &quot;Live architecture&quot; exhibit of buildings, open spaces and streets in the Lansbury Estate, Poplar (named after the former Labour Party leader George Lansbury. Plans for social housing in the area had commenced in 1943. By the end of the war nearly a quarter of the buildings in this part of East London had been destroyed or badly damaged. In 1948, the Architecture Council decided that the Poplar site would make a good exhibition partly because it was near to the other Festival exhibitions. Despite funding problems, work began in December 1949 and by May 1950 was well advanced. The wet winter of 1950–51 delayed work, but the first houses were completed and occupied by February 1951. The exhibition opened on 3 May 1951 along with the other Festival exhibitions. Visitors first went to the Building Research Pavilion, which displayed housing problems and their solutions, then to the Town Planning Pavilion, a large, red-and-white striped tent. The Town Planning Pavilion demonstrated the principles of town planning and the urgent need for new towns, including a mock up of an imaginary town called &quot;Avoncaster&quot;. Visitors then saw the buildings of the Lansbury Estate. Attendance was disappointing, only 86,426 people visiting, compared to 8 million who visited the South Bank exhibition. Reaction to the development by industry professionals was lukewarm, some criticising its small scale. Subsequent local authorities concentrated on high-rise, high-density social housing rather than the Lansbury Estate model. The estate remains popular with residents. Among the remaining 1951 buildings are Trinity Independent Chapel, and The Festival Inn and Festive Briton (now Callaghans) pubs.

Misha Black, one of the Festival architects, said that the Festival created a wide audience for architectural modernism but that it was common currency among professional architects that the design of the Festival was not innovative. The design writer Reyner Banham has questioned the originality and the Englishness of the Festival Style and indeed the extent of its influence. Young architects in 1951 are said to have despised the Festival of Britain for its architecture. &quot;It was equated with the &#x27;Contemporary Style&#x27;, and an editorial on New Brutalism in &quot;Architectural Design&quot; in 1955 carried the epigraph, &#x27;When I hear the word &quot;Contemporary&quot; I reach for my revolver.&#x27;&quot;

===Design===

The South Bank Exhibition included a Design Review that presented &quot;an illustrated record of contemporary achievement in British industry&quot;, showing &quot;the high standard of design and craftsmanship that has been reached in a wide range of British products.&quot; The exhibits were based on the stock list of the Council of Industrial Design (CoID) and were chosen for appearance, finish, workmanship, technical efficiency, fitness for purpose and economy of production. In selecting and promoting designs in this way, the Festival was an influential advocate of the concept of &quot;Good Design&quot;, a rational approach to product design in accordance with the principles of the Modern Movement. Its advocacy of Good Design had grown partly out of the standards of utility furniture created during the war (Gordon Russell, the Director of the CoID, had been Chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel) and partly out of the CoID&#x27;s Britain Can Make It exhibition of 1946. The CoiD&#x27;s stock list was retained and inherited by its successor, the Design Council.

Design, science and industry came together in the Festival Pattern Group, which commissioned textiles, wallpaper, domestic objects and Festival exhibits based on x-ray crystallography. The idea of using the molecular patterns revealed in x-ray crystallography in surface patterns was first suggested by Dr Helen Megaw, a leading Cambridge University crystallographer. After hearing a presentation by Dorothy Hodgkin to the Society of Industrial Artists, Mark Hartland Thomas, chief industrial officer of the CoID, took up the idea and formed the Festival Pattern Group. Hartland Thomas was a member of the Festival of Britain Presentation Panel and was co-ordinating the CoID&#x27;s stock list. He secured the Regatta Restaurant, one of the temporary restaurants on the South Bank, for an experiment in pattern design based on the crystal structure of haemoglobin, insulin, wareite, china clay, mica and other molecules, which were used for the surface patterns of the restaurant furnishings. The designs that were sponsored by the Festival Pattern Group chimed in with displays in the Dome of Discovery about the structure of matter and the Festival&#x27;s emphasis on progress, science and technology. The Science Museum in London holds a collection of the Festival&#x27;s fabrics donated by Dr Megaw; it also includes the official souvenir book by Mark Hartland Thomas.

Lettering and type design featured prominently in the graphic style of the Festival and was overseen by a typography panel including the lettering historian Nicolete Gray. A typeface for the Festival, Festival Titling, was specially commissioned and designed by Philip Boydell. It was based on condensed sans-serif capitals and had a three-dimensional form making it suitable for use in exhibition display typography. It has been said to bear &quot;a vague resemblance to bunting&quot;. The lettering on the Royal Festival Hall and the temporary Festival building on the South Bank was a bold, sloping slab serif letter form, determined by Gray and her colleagues, including Charles Hasler and Gordon Cullen, illustrated in Gray&#x27;s &quot;Lettering on Buildings&quot; (1960) and derived in part from typefaces used in the early 19th century. It has been described as a &quot;turn to a jauntier and more decorative visual language&quot; that was &quot;part of a wider move towards the appreciation of vernacular arts and the peculiarities of English culture&quot;. The lettering in the Lion and Unicorn Pavilion was designed by John Brinkley.

The graphic designer for the Festival was Abram Games, who created its emblem, the Festival Star.

===The arts===
The South Bank Exhibition showed the work of contemporary artists such as William Scott, including murals by Victor Pasmore, John Tunnard, Feliks Topolski, Barbara Jones, and John Piper and sculptures by Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Lynn Chadwick, Jacob Epstein and Reg Butler.

Arts festivals were held throughout the summer as part of the Festival of Britain:

*Swansea Festival of Music &quot;16–29 September&quot;
*Worcester (Three Choirs Festival) &quot;2–7 September&quot;
*York Festival (including a revival of the York Mystery Plays)

The London Season of the Arts comprised exhibitions specially arranged for the Festival of Britain. They included:
*&quot;An Exhibition of Sixty Large Paintings commissioned for the Festival of Britain&quot; (&quot;60 Paintings for &#x27;51&quot;), Suffolk Galleries, organised by the Arts Council, prize awarded to William Gear;
*Exhibitions of the works of Hogarth and Henry Moore, Tate Gallery;
*Open-air International Exhibition of Sculpture, Battersea Park;
*&quot;Modern British Painting&quot;, New Burlington Gallery;
*&quot;An Exhibition of Exhibitions&quot;, Royal Society of the Arts.
*Two exhibitions at the Whitechapel Art Gallery: &quot;Black Eyes and Lemonade&quot; and &quot;East End 1851&quot;.

Barbara Jones and Tom Ingram organised &quot;Black Eyes and Lemonade&quot;, an exhibition of British popular and traditional art, in association with the Society for Education in Art and the Arts Council. In the same year she surveyed the popular arts in her influential book, &quot;The Unsophisticated Arts&quot;, which included taxidermy, fairgrounds, canal boats, seaside, riverside, tattooing, the decoration of food, waxworks, toys, rustic work, shops, festivals and funerals. She said of the popular arts,&quot; some of it is made for themselves by people without professional training in the arts or in the appreciation of them, and some of it has been made for those people by professionals who work to their taste.&quot;

The Festival was the occasion of the first performance of steelpan music in Britain by the Trinidad All Steel Percussion Orchestra.

===Film===

The British Film Institute was asked by Herbert Morrison in 1948 to consider the contribution that film could make to the Festival. It set up a panel including Michael Balcon, Antony Asquith, John Grierson, Harry Watt and Arthur Elston, which became a committee of sponsorship and distribution. Over a dozen sponsored documentary films were made for the Festival, including

*&quot;Air Parade&quot;, sponsored by the Shell Film Unit
*&quot;Family Portrait&quot;, made by Humphrey Jennings
*&quot;David&quot;, a short film based on the life of David Rees Griffiths (and in which he appeared), made by Wide Pictures and the Welsh Committee 
*&quot;Water of Time&quot;, made by International Realist films and sponsored by the Port of London Authority
*&quot;Forward a Century&quot;, sponsored by the Petroleum Films Bureau.

Several feature films were planned, but only one was completed in time, namely &quot;The Magic Box&quot;, a biopic concerning pioneer William Friese-Greene, made by Festival Film Productions.

There was a purpose-built film theatre on the South Bank, the Telecinema (sometimes called the &quot;Telekinema&quot;), designed by Wells Coates, which showed documentary and experimental film exploiting stereophony and stereoscopy and the new invention of television. It was one of the most popular attractions of the Festival, with 458,693 visitors. When the Festival ended, the Telecinema was handed over to the BFI for use as a members-only repertory cinema club, re-opening in 1952 as the National Film Theatre.

Film was integral to the South Bank Exhibition, used to explain manufacturing, science and technology. The Dome of Discovery, the Exhibition of Science in South Kensington and the travelling Festival Exhibition made extensive use of educational and explanatory film.

Film festivals, including those at Edinburgh Film Festival, Bath and Glasgow participated in the Festival of Britain, and local authorities put on film festivals, helped by a BFI pamphlet, &quot;How to put on a Film Show&quot;.

Commercial cinema chains and independent cinemas also joined in, the Gaumont and Odeon chains programming seasons of British films. &quot;And finally, if the Festival visitor had not tired of the medium, they could purchase colour 16mm film of Britain’s historic buildings and pageantry and filmstrips of the Festival of Britain and London as souvenirs.&quot;

One of the British Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s contributions to the Festival was a television musical entitled &quot;The Golden Year&quot;, broadcast on 23 June and 2 July.

===Science===

A new wing was built for the Science Museum to hold the &quot;Exhibition of Science&quot;. The first part of the exhibition showed the physical and chemical nature of matter and the behaviour of elements and molecules. The second part, &quot;The Structure of Living Things&quot;, dealt with plants and animals. The third part, &quot;Stop Press&quot;, showed some of the latest topics of research in science and their emergence from the ideas illustrated in the earlier sections of the exhibition. They included &quot;the penetrating rays which reach us from outer space, what goes on in space and in the stars, and a range of subjects from the electronic brain to the processes and structures on which life is based.&quot;

It has been claimed that &quot;the Festival of Britain created a confusion at the heart of subsequent discussions amongst administrators and educationalists concerning the place science should have in British life and thought as a whole (particularly education), and its role in Britain’s post-war greatness.&quot;

==Other festival events==

There were hundreds of events associated with the Festival, some of which were:
*The selection of Trowell, a Nottinghamshire village in the middle of England, as the Festival Village
*The re-design of Parliament Square by George Grey Wornum in preparation for the Festival of Britain year
*Commemorative postage stamps and many souvenirs, official and unofficial
*A commemorative crown coin (presented with a certificate in either a red or green presentation box), The crown coin featured on its reverse the St. George and the Dragon design by Benedetto Pistrucci, best known for its place on British Sovereign coins. The certificate states &quot;The first English Silver Crown piece was minted in 1551. Four hundred years later, on the occasion of the Festival of Britain, the Royal Mint has issued a Crown piece, bearing on its edge the Latin inscription MDCCCLI CIVIUM INDUSTRIA FLORET CIVITAS MCMLI-1951 &quot;By the industry of its people the State flourishes&quot; 1951&quot;. A non-circulating cupronickel coin, about 2 million were minted, most in &quot;prooflike&quot; condition. It remains very inexpensive
*The restoration of Moot Hall, Elstow by Bedfordshire County Council
*The first performance of Robert McLellan&#x27;s play &quot;Mary Stewart&quot; at the Glasgow Citizens Theatre
*The first performance of Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s opera &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; on 26 April 1951, at the Royal Opera House
*An exhibition about Sherlock Holmes (part of which is now owned by Westminster Libraries and part by the Sherlock Holmes pub)
* &quot;The William Shakespeare&quot; and &quot;The Merchant Venturer&quot;, two daily excursion trains run by the Western Region of British Railways from London to sites of British history, Stratford upon Avon and Bristol. &quot;The William Shakespeare&quot; proved to be financially unviable and only ran for the summer of the festival, but &quot;The Merchant Venturer&quot; remained in service until 1961

==Attendance figures==
The Festival was highly popular in every part of Britain. Richard Weight estimates that of the national population of 49 million, about half participated. The Festival largely ignored foreign tourists, with most of the visitors from the Continent being expatriate Britons.

There were over ten million paid admissions to the six main exhibitions over a period of five months: The most popular event was the centrepiece at South Bank Exhibition with almost 8.5 million visitors, over half of them from outside London. The Festival Pleasure Gardens had over 8 million visitors, three-quarters of them from London. The Festival Ship &quot;Campania&quot;, which docked in ten cities, was visited by almost 900,000 people. The Travelling Land Exhibition, which went to four English cities, attracted under half a million. The most specialised events, in terms of attracting few visitors, were the architecture exhibition in Poplar, with 87,000 visitors and the exhibition of books in South Kensington, with 63,000.


==Political responses==
The idea of holding the Festival became a party political issue. Although Herbert Morrison said that he did not want the Festival to be seen as a political venture, it became associated with the Labour Party, which had won the 1950 general election, and it was opposed by the Conservative Party. Hugh Casson said that, &quot;Churchill, like the rest of the Tory Party, was against the Festival which they (quite rightly) believed was the advanced guard of socialism.&quot; Churchill referred to the forthcoming Festival of Britain as &quot;three-dimensional Socialist propaganda.&quot;

In an essay on the Festival, 17-year-old Michael Frayn characterised it as an enterprise of &quot;the radical middle-classes, the do-gooders; the readers of the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The Observer&quot;; the signers of petitions; the backbone of the B.B.C.,&quot; whom he called &quot;Herbivores&quot;. In Frayn&#x27;s view, &quot;The Festival was the last, and virtually the posthumous, work of the Herbivore Britain of the BBC News, the Crown Film Unit, the sweet ration, the Ealing comedies, Uncle Mac, Sylvia Peters.&quot; In making the Festival the Herbivores &quot;earned the contempt of the Carnivores – the readers of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;; the Evelyn Waughs; the cast of the Directory of Directors&quot;.

Some prominent members of the Labour government considered the Festival to be a Labour undertaking which would contribute to their future electoral success, and Clement Attlee, the Labour leader, wrote to Morrison saying that an election in autumn 1951 would enable the Labour Party to benefit from its popularity. In the event, Labour lost the autumn election.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Guide Book&quot; to the Festival described its legacy in these words: &quot;It will leave behind not just a record of what we have thought of ourselves in the year 1951 but, in a fair community founded where once there was a slum, in an avenue of trees or in some work of art, a reminder of what we have done to write this single, adventurous year into our national and local history.&quot;

While the idea of the Festival was being worked out, the government and the London County Council were at the same time planning the redevelopment of the South Bank site, including &quot;a number of great buildings, which will form part of a co-ordinated design.&quot; The first of these was the Royal Festival Hall. The Festival hastened the reclamation of four and a half acres of land from the river, which &quot;transformed the familiar patchwork of rubble and half-derelict buildings which had for so long monopolised the propect from the North Bank&quot;. The Festival site was, over the following thirty years, developed into the South Bank Centre, an arts complex comprising the Royal Festival Hall, the National Film Theatre, the Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Purcell Room and the National Theatre.

A 1951 office building at 219 Oxford Street, London, designed by Ronald Ward and Partners (now a Grade II* listed building), incorporates images of the Festival on its facade.

The Festival cost about £10.5 million (apart from the loans for the Festival Gardens), with revenues of about £2.5m. The net cost was £8 million (equivalent to £ million today).

In 1953 the Festival of Britain Office was abolished and its records were taken over by the Ministry of Works.

As well as the material legacy, the Festival gave rise to new traditions, in particular the performances of medieval mystery plays in York and Chester. There was an explosion of interest in these plays, regular performance of which have continued in those cities ever since.

In 2018 Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the government was planning a Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to be held in 2022. The proposed festival, which was intended to unite the United Kingdom after Brexit, was widely criticised as it coincided with centenary of the Irish Civil War and risked inflaming tensions in Northern Ireland. The graphic designer Richard Littler, creator of Scarfolk, created a satirical poster for the Festival based on the cover of the original 1951 guide, reimagining the profile of the nation&#x27;s symbolic figurehead Britannia shooting herself in the head.

==Images of the Festival of Britain==
Several images of the South Bank Exhibition can be found on the internet, including many released by The National Archives on the 60th anniversary of the festival.

A filmed retrospective of the South Bank Exhibition, &quot;Brief City&quot; (1952), with special reference to design and architecture, was made by Richard Massingham for &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper. A film comedy, &quot;The Happy Family&quot;, was made about working-class resistance to the demolition that the festival required. The Festival is featured in the early portion of the film &quot;Prick up your Ears&quot;.

The archive of the Design Council held at the University of Brighton Design Archives includes several hundred images of the festival. They can be searched via the Visual Arts Data Service (VADS).

<doc id="66159" wikidata="Q156106" url="?curid=66159" title="Alfalfa">
<text>Alfalfa () (Medicago sativa), also called lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop. The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is more commonly used in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plant superficially resembles clover (a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when trifoliate leaves comprising round leaflets predominate. Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in two to three turns containing 10–20 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer temperate climates. It has been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

==Description==
Alfalfa is a perennial forage legume which normally lives four to eight years, but can live more than 20 years, depending on variety and climate. The plant grows to a height of up to , and has a deep root system, sometimes growing to a depth of more than to reach groundwater. Typically the root system grows to a depth of depending on subsoil constraints.

Alfalfa is a small-seeded crop and has a slowly growing seedling, but after several months of establishment, it forms a tough &quot;crown&quot; at the top of the root system. This crown contains shoot buds that enable alfalfa to regrow many times after being grazed or harvested.

Alfalfa has a tetraploid genome.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;alfalfa&quot; is a Spanish modification of the Arabic word .

== Ecology ==
Alfalfa is considered an insectary, a place where insects are reared, and has been proposed as helpful to other crops, such as cotton, if the two are interplanted, because the alfalfa harbours predatory and parasitic insects that would protect the other crop. Harvesting the alfalfa by mowing the entire crop area destroys the insect population, but this can be avoided by mowing in strips so that part of the growth remains.

Owing to its deep root system, it helps to improve soil nitrogen fertility and protect from soil erosion. This depth of root system, and perenniality of crowns that store carbohydrates as an energy reserve, make it very resilient, especially to droughts.

This plant exhibits autotoxicity, which means it is difficult for alfalfa seed to grow in existing stands of alfalfa. Therefore, alfalfa fields are recommended to be rotated with other species (for example, corn or wheat) before reseeding. The exact mechanism of autotoxicity is unclear, with medicarpins and phenols both seeming to play a role. Levels of autotoxicity in soil depends on soil type (clay soils maintain autotoxicity for longer), cultivar and age of the previous crop. A soil assay can be used to measure autotoxicity. Resistance to autotoxicity also varies by cultivar, a tolerant one being &#x27;WL 656HQ&#x27;.

=== Pests and diseases ===

Like most plants, alfalfa can be attacked by various pests and pathogens. Diseases often have subtle symptoms which are easily misdiagnosed and can affect leaves, roots, stems and blossoms.

Some pests, such as the alfalfa weevil, aphids, and potato leafhopper, can reduce alfalfa yields dramatically, particularly with the second cutting when weather is warmest. Spotted alfalfa aphid, broadly spread in Australia, not only sucks sap but also injects salivary toxins into the leaves. Registered insecticides or chemical controls are sometimes used to prevent this and labels will specify the withholding period before the forage crop can be grazed or cut for hay or silage. Alfalfa is also susceptible to root rots, including &quot;Phytophthora&quot;, &quot;Rhizoctonia&quot;, and Texas root rot. Alfalfa is also susceptible to downy mildew caused by the oomycete species &quot;Peronospora aestivalis&quot;.

== Cultivation ==
Alfalfa is widely grown throughout the world as forage for cattle, and is most often harvested as hay, but can also be made into silage, grazed, or fed as greenchop. Alfalfa usually has the highest feeding value of all common hay crops. It is used less frequently as pasture. When grown on soils where it is well-adapted, alfalfa is often the highest-yielding forage plant, but its primary benefit is the combination of high yield per hectare and high nutritional quality.

Its primary use is as feed for high-producing dairy cows, because of its high protein content and highly digestible fiber, and secondarily for beef cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. Alfalfa hay is a widely used protein and fiber source for meat rabbits. In poultry diets, dehydrated alfalfa and alfalfa leaf concentrates are used for pigmenting eggs and meat, because of their high content in carotenoids, which are efficient for colouring egg yolk and body lipids. Humans also eat alfalfa sprouts in salads and sandwiches. Dehydrated alfalfa leaf is commercially available as a dietary supplement in several forms, such as tablets, powders and tea. Fresh alfalfa can cause bloating in livestock, so care must be taken with livestock grazing on alfalfa because of this hazard.

Like other legumes, its root nodules contain bacteria, &quot;Sinorhizobium meliloti&quot;, with the ability to fix nitrogen, producing a high-protein feed regardless of available nitrogen in the soil. Its nitrogen-fixing ability (which increases soil nitrogen) and its use as an animal feed greatly improve agricultural efficiency.

Alfalfa can be sown in spring or fall, and does best on well-drained soils with a neutral pH of 6.8–7.5. Alfalfa requires sustained levels of potassium and phosphorus to grow well. It is moderately sensitive to salt levels in both the soil and irrigation water, although it continues to be grown in the arid southwestern United States, where salinity is an emerging issue. Soils low in fertility should be fertilized with manure or a chemical fertilizer, but correction of pH is particularly important. Usually a seeding rate of is recommended, with differences based upon region, soil type, and seeding method. A nurse crop is sometimes used, particularly for spring plantings, to reduce weed problems and soil erosion, but can lead to competition for light, water, and nutrients.

In most climates, alfalfa is cut three to four times a year, but it can be harvested up to 12 times per year in Arizona and southern California. Total yields are typically around in temperate environments, but yields have been recorded up to . Yields vary with region, weather, and the crop&#x27;s stage of maturity when cut. Later cuttings improve yield, but with reduced nutritional content.

=== History ===
Alfalfa seems to have originated in south-central Asia, and was first cultivated in Central Asia. According to Pliny (died 79 AD), it was introduced to Greece in about 490 BC when the Persians invaded Greek territory. Alfalfa cultivation is discussed in the fourth-century AD book &quot;Opus Agriculturae&quot; by Palladius, stating: &quot;One sow-down lasts ten years. The crop may be cut four or six times a year ... A jugerum of it is abundantly sufficient for three horses all the year ... It may be given to cattle, but new provender is at first to be administered very sparingly, because it bloats up the cattle.&quot;

The medieval Arabic agricultural writer Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam, who lived in Spain in the later 12th century, discussed how to cultivate alfalfa, which he called (&quot;&quot;). A 13th-century general-purpose Arabic dictionary, &quot;Lisān al-&#x27;Arab&quot;, says that alfalfa is cultivated as an animal feed and consumed in both fresh and dried forms. It is from the Arabic that the Spanish name &quot;alfalfa&quot; was derived.

In the 16th century, Spanish colonizers introduced alfalfa to the Americas as fodder for their horses.

In the North American colonies of the eastern US in the 18th century, it was called &quot;lucerne&quot;, and many trials at growing it were made, but generally without sufficiently successful results. Relatively little is grown in the southeastern US today. Lucerne (or &quot;luzerne&quot;) is the name for alfalfa in Britain, Australia, France, Germany, and a number of other countries. Alfalfa seeds were imported to California from Chile in the 1850s. That was the beginning of a rapid and extensive introduction of the crop over the western US and introduced the word &quot;alfalfa&quot; to the English language. Since North and South America now produce a large part of the world&#x27;s output, the word &quot;alfalfa&quot; has been slowly entering other languages.

=== Harvesting ===

When alfalfa is to be used as hay, it is usually cut and baled. Loose haystacks are still used in some areas, but bales are easier for use in transportation, storage, and feed. Ideally, the first cutting should be taken at the bud stage, and the subsequent cuttings just as the field is beginning to flower, or one-tenth bloom because carbohydrates are at their highest. When using farm equipment rather than hand-harvesting, a swather cuts the alfalfa and arranges it in windrows. In areas where the alfalfa does not immediately dry out on its own, a machine known as a mower-conditioner is used to cut the hay. The mower-conditioner has a set of rollers or flails that crimp and break the stems as they pass through the mower, making the alfalfa dry faster. After the alfalfa has dried, a tractor pulling a baler collects the hay into bales.

Several types of bales are commonly used for alfalfa. For small animals and individual horses, the alfalfa is baled into small, two-string bales, commonly named by the strands of string used to wrap it. Other bale sizes are three-string, and so on up to half-ton (six-string) &quot;square&quot; bales – actually rectangular, and typically about . Small square bales weigh from depending on moisture, and can be easily hand separated into &quot;flakes&quot;. Cattle ranches use large round bales, typically in diameter and weighing from . These bales can be placed in stable stacks or in large feeders for herds of horses or unrolled on the ground for large herds of cattle. The bales can be loaded and stacked with a tractor using a spike, known as a &quot;bale spear&quot; that pierces the center of the bale, or they can be handled with a grapple (claw) on the tractor&#x27;s front-end loader.

When used as feed for dairy cattle, alfalfa is often made into haylage by a process known as ensiling. Rather than being dried to make dry hay, the alfalfa is chopped finely and fermented in silos, trenches, or bags, where the oxygen supply can be limited to promote fermentation. The anaerobic fermentation of alfalfa allows it to retain high nutrient levels similar to those of fresh forage, and is also more palatable to dairy cattle than dry hay. In many cases, alfalfa silage is inoculated with different strains of microorganisms to improve the fermentation quality and aerobic stability of the silage.

=== Production ===
During the early 2000s, alfalfa was the most cultivated forage legume in the world. Worldwide production was around 436 million tons in 2006. In 2009, alfalfa was grown on approximately worldwide; of this North America produced 41% (), Europe produced 25% (), South America produced 23% (), Asia produced 8% (), and Africa and Oceania produced the remainder. The US was the largest alfalfa producer in the world by area in 2009, with , but considerable production area is found in Argentina (), Canada (), Russia (), Italy (), and China ().

==== United States ====

In the United States in 2012, the leading alfalfa-growing states were California, Idaho, and Montana. Alfalfa is predominantly grown in the northern and western US; it can be grown in the southeastern US, but leaf and root diseases, poor soils, and a lack of well-adapted varieties are often limitations.

In California, varieties resistant to the spotted alfalfa aphid (&quot;Therioaphis maculata&quot;) are necessary, but even that is not always enough due to constant resistance evolution.

==== Australia ====
Lucerne grown in Australia prior to the 1970s was from seed brought from Great Britain in the early years of colonization, with production most successful in the Hunter and Peel river valleys. Hunter River cv. was the first lucerne variety developed for the Australian environment and was bred from selections of pre-existing lucerne stands in the Upper Hunter River (New South Wales) region. Pest burdens from the spotted alfalfa aphid in the 1970s caused significant destruction of NSW lucerne paddocks, with surviving populations being used as parents for Hunterfield cv. (released 1983). This variety showed significant improvement of resistance to spotted alfalfa aphid.

Grazing is the most commonly used form of pasture management in Australia, with many varieties of lucerne specifically being bred for low rainfall, high grazing pressure. 

New South Wales produces 40% of Australia&#x27;s lucerne. Due to the introduction of the spotted alfalfa aphid (&quot;Therioaphis maculata&quot;) in 1977 all varieties grown there must be resistant to it. South Australia is home to 83% of all lucerne seed production in Australia. Much of this seed industry is centred around the town of Keith, South Australia, also encompassing the neighbouring localities of Tintinara, Bordertown, Willalooka, Padthaway and Naracoorte.

=== Alfalfa and bees ===
Alfalfa seed production requires the presence of pollinators when the fields of alfalfa are in bloom. Alfalfa pollination is somewhat problematic, however, because western honey bees, the most commonly used pollinator, are less than ideal for this purpose; the pollen-carrying keel of the alfalfa flower trips and strikes pollinating bees on the head, which helps transfer the pollen to the foraging bee. Western honey bees, however, do not like being struck in the head repeatedly and learn to defeat this action by drawing nectar from the side of the flower. The bees thus collect the nectar, but carry no pollen, so do not pollinate the next flower they visit. Because older, experienced bees do not pollinate alfalfa well, most pollination is accomplished by young bees that have not yet learned the trick of robbing the flower without tripping the head-knocking keel.

When western honey bees are used to pollinate alfalfa, the beekeeper stocks the field at a very high rate to maximize the number of young bees. However, Western honey bee colonies may suffer protein stress when working alfalfa only, because alfalfa pollen protein is deficient in isoleucine, one of the amino acids essential in the diet of honeybee larvae.

Today, the alfalfa leafcutter bee (&quot;Megachile rotundata&quot;) is increasingly used to circumvent these problems. As a solitary but gregarious bee species, it does not build colonies or store honey, but is a very efficient pollinator of alfalfa flowers. Nesting is in individual tunnels in wooden or plastic material, supplied by the alfalfa seed growers. The leafcutter bees are used in the Pacific Northwest, while western honeybees dominate in California alfalfa seed production.

&quot;M. rotundata&quot; was unintentionally introduced into the US during the 1940s, and its management as a pollinator of alfalfa has led to a three-fold increase in seed production in the U.S. The synchronous emergence of the adult bees of this species during alfalfa blooming period in combination with such behaviors as gregarious nesting, and utilization of leaves and nesting materials that have been mass-produced by humans provide positive benefits for the use of these bees in pollinating alfalfa.

A smaller amount of alfalfa produced for seed is pollinated by the alkali bee, mostly in the northwestern US. It is cultured in special beds near the fields. These bees also have their own problems. They are not portable like honey bees, and when fields are planted in new areas, the bees take several seasons to build up. Honey bees are still trucked to many of the fields at bloom time.

The rusty patched bumble bee, &quot;Bombus affinis&quot;, is important to the agricultural industry as well as for the pollination of alfalfa. It is known that members of this species pollinate up to 65 different species of plants, and it is the primary pollinator of key dietary crops, such as cranberries, plums, apples, onions, and alfalfa.

=== Varieties ===
Considerable research and development has been done with this important plant. Older cultivars such as &#x27;Vernal&#x27; have been the standard for years, but many public and private varieties better adapted to particular climates are available. Private companies release many new varieties each year in the US.

Most varieties go dormant in the fall, with reduced growth in response to low temperatures and shorter days. &#x27;Nondormant&#x27; varieties that grow through the winter are planted in long-season environments such as Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California, whereas &#x27;dormant&#x27; varieties are planted in the Upper Midwest, Canada, and the Northeast. &#x27;Nondormant&#x27; varieties can be higher-yielding, but they are susceptible to winter-kill in cold climates and have poorer persistence.

Most alfalfa cultivars contain genetic material from &quot;sickle medick&quot; (&quot;M.&quot; &quot;falcata&quot;), a crop wild relative of alfalfa that naturally hybridizes with &quot;M. sativa&quot; to produce &quot;sand lucerne&quot; (&quot;M. sativa&quot; ssp. &quot;varia&quot;). This species may bear either the purple flowers of alfalfa or the yellow of sickle medick, and is so called for its ready growth in sandy soil. Traits for insect resistance have also been introduced from &quot;M. glomerata&quot; and &quot;M. prostrata&quot;, members of alfalfa&#x27;s secondary gene pool.

Most of the improvements in alfalfa over the last decades have consisted of better disease resistance on poorly drained soils in wet years, better ability to overwinter in cold climates, and the production of more leaves. Multileaf alfalfa varieties have more than three leaflets per leaf.

Alfalfa growers or lucerne growers have a suite of varieties or cultivars to choose from in the seed marketplace and base their selection on a number of factors including the dormancy or activity rating, crown height, fit for purpose (i.e., hay production or grazing), disease resistance, insect pest resistance, forage yield, fine leafed varieties and a combination of many favourable attributes. Plant breeding efforts use scientific methodology and technology to strive for new improved varieties.

The L. Teweles Seed Company claimed it created the world&#x27;s first hybrid alfalfa.

Wisconsin and California and many other states publish alfalfa variety trial data. A complete listing of state variety testing data is provided by the North American Alfalfa Improvement Conference (NAAIC) State Listing, as well as additional detailed alfalfa genetic and variety data published by NAAIC.

==== Genetic modification====
Roundup Ready alfalfa (RRA), a genetically modified variety, was released by Forage Genetics International in 2005. This was developed through the insertion of a gene owned by Monsanto Company that confers resistance to glyphosate, a broad-spectrum herbicide, also known as Roundup. Although most grassy and broadleaf plants, including ordinary alfalfa, are killed by Roundup, growers can spray fields of Roundup Ready alfalfa with the glyphosate herbicide and kill the weeds without harming the alfalfa crop.

===== Legal issues in the US =====
In 2005, after completing a 28-page environmental assessment the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) granted RRA nonregulated status under Code of Federal Regulations Title 7 Part 340, which regulates, among other things, the introduction (importation, interstate movement, or release into the environment) of organisms and products altered or produced through genetic engineering that are plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests. Monsanto had to seek deregulation to conduct field trials of RRA, because the RRA contains a promoter sequence derived from the plant pathogen figwort mosaic virus. The USDA granted the application for deregulation, stating that the RRA with its modifications: &quot;(1) Exhibit no plant pathogenic properties; (2) are no more likely to become weedy than the nontransgenic parental line or other cultivated alfalfa; (3) are unlikely to increase the weediness potential of any other cultivated or wild species with which it can interbreed; (4) will not cause damage to raw or processed agricultural commodities; (5) will not harm threatened or endangered species or organisms that are beneficial to agriculture; and (6) should not reduce the ability to control pests and weeds in alfalfa or other crops.&quot; Monsanto started selling RRA and within two years, more than 300,000 acres were devoted to the plant in the US.

The granting of deregulation was opposed by many groups, including growers of non-GM alfalfa who were concerned about gene flow into their crops. In 2006, the Center for Food Safety, a US non-governmental organization that is a critic of biotech crops, and others, challenged this deregulation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Organic growers were concerned that the GM alfalfa could cross-pollinate with their organic alfalfa, making their crops unsalable in countries that ban the growing of GM crops. The District Court ruled that the USDA&#x27;s environmental assessment did not address two issues concerning RRA&#x27;s effect on the environment, and in 2007, required the USDA to complete a much more extensive environmental impact statement (EIS). Until the EIS was completed, they banned further planting of RRA but allowed land already planted to continue. The USDA proposed a partial deregulation of RRA but this was also rejected by the District Court. Planting of RRA was halted.

In June 2009, a divided three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the District Court&#x27;s decision. Monsanto and others appealed to the US Supreme Court.

On 21 June 2010, in &quot;Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms&quot;, the Supreme Court overturned the District Court decision to ban planting RRA nationwide as there was no evidence of irreparable injury. They ruled that the USDA could partially deregulate RRA before an EIS was completed. The Supreme Court did not consider the District Court&#x27;s ruling disallowing RRA&#x27;s deregulation and consequently RRA was still a regulated crop waiting for USDA&#x27;s completion of an EIS.

This decision was welcomed by the American Farm Bureau Federation, Biotechnology Industry Organization, American Seed Trade Association, American Soybean Association, National Alfalfa and Forage Alliance, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Cotton Council, and National Potato Council. In July 2010, 75 members of Congress from both political parties sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack asking him to immediately allow limited planting of genetically engineered alfalfa. However the USDA did not issue interim deregulatory measures, instead focusing on completing the EIS. Their 2,300-page EIS, published in December 2010, concluded that RRA would not affect the environment.

Three of the biggest natural food brands in the US lobbied for a partial deregulation of RRA, but in January 2011, despite protests from organic groups, Secretary Vilsack announced that the USDA had approved the unrestricted planting of genetically modified alfalfa and planting resumed. Secretary Vilsack commented, &quot;After conducting a thorough and transparent examination of alfalfa ... APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] has determined that [RRA] is as safe as traditionally bred alfalfa.&quot; About of alfalfa were grown in the US, the fourth-biggest crop by acreage, of which about 1% were organic. Some biotechnology officials forecast that half of the US alfalfa acreage could eventually be planted with GM alfalfa.

The National Corn Growers Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and the Council for Biotech Information warmly applauded this decision. Christine Bushway, CEO of the Organic Trade Association, said, &quot;A lot of people are shell-shocked. While we feel Secretary Vilsack worked on this issue, which is progress, this decision puts our organic farmers at risk.&quot; The Organic Trade Association issued a press release in 2011 saying that the USDA recognized the impact that cross-contamination could have on organic alfalfa and urged them to place restrictions to minimize any such contamination. However, organic farming groups, organic food outlets, and activists responded by publishing an open letter saying that planting the &quot;alfalfa without any restrictions flies in the face of the interests of conventional and organic farmers, preservation of the environment, and consumer choice&quot;. In addition to House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas, Senator Debbie Stabenow (Chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee) and Senator Richard Lugar strongly supported the decision, respectively stating that it would give growers &quot;the green light to begin planting an abundant, affordable and safe crop&quot; and give farmers and consumers the &quot;choice ... in planting or purchasing food grown with GM technology, conventionally, or organically&quot;. In a joint statement, US Senator Patrick Leahy and Representative Peter DeFazio said the USDA had the &quot;opportunity to address the concerns of all farmers&quot;, but instead &quot;surrender[ed] to business as usual for the biotech industry&quot;.

In March 2011, the non-profit Center for Food Safety appealed the deregulation decision, which the District Court for Northern California rejected in 2012.

== Safety concerns ==
Alfalfa sprouts may contain microbiological pathogens, mainly from &quot;Salmonella&quot; or &quot;E.&quot; &quot;coli&quot;, which have caused numerous food product recalls and illness outbreaks, putting sprouts into a &quot;high risk&quot; category for food safety. People with weakened immune systems, such as the elderly, pregnant women, or those taking prescription drugs affecting the immune system, should not eat sprouts.

With long-term human consumption of alfalfa seeds, several safety concerns and medication interactions may result, including possible reactions similar to lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease.

Other concerns are for women during pregnancy or breast-feeding, hormone-sensitive conditions (such as breast, uterine, and ovarian cancers), and for people with diabetes. Alfalfa may interact with warfarin (e.g. Coumadin), birth control pills (contraceptive drugs), and estrogens.

=== Toxicity of canavanine ===
Raw alfalfa seeds and sprouts are a source of the amino acid canavanine. Much of the canavanine is converted into other amino acids during germination, so sprouts contain much less canavanine than unsprouted seeds. Canavanine competes with arginine, resulting in the synthesis of dysfunctional proteins. Raw unsprouted alfalfa has toxic effects in primates, including humans, which can result in lupus-like symptoms and other immunological diseases in susceptible individuals. Stopping consumption of alfalfa seeds can reverse the effects.

=== Phytoestrogens and effect on livestock fertility ===
Alfalfa, like other leguminous crops, is a source of phytoestrogens, including spinasterol, coumestrol, and coumestan. Because of this, grazing on alfalfa during breeding can cause reduced fertility in sheep and in dairy cattle if not effectively managed.

Coumestrol levels in alfalfa have been shown to be elevated by fungal infection, but not significantly under drought stress or aphid infestation. Grazing management can be utilised to mitigate the effects of coumestrol on ewe reproductive performance, with full recovery after removal from alfalfa. Coumestrol levels in unirrigated crops can be predicted practically using weather variables.

== Nutrition ==
Raw alfalfa seed sprouts are 93% water, 2% carbohydrates, 4% protein, and contain negligible fat. In a reference amount, raw alfalfa sprouts supply of food energy and 29% of the Daily Value of vitamin K. They are a moderate source of vitamin C, some B vitamins, phosphorus, and zinc.

=== Sprouts ===

Sprouting alfalfa seeds is the process of germinating seeds at the immature stage for use as a garnish on various food preparations, such as salads. Although sprouts may be grown in soil, they are more commonly germinated in a soilless medium using drums, trays or racks.

<text>Marie-José Pérec (; born 9 May 1968) is a retired French track and field sprinter who specialised in the 200 and 400 metres and is a three-time Olympic gold medalist. She was born in the French overseas department of Guadeloupe and moved to Paris when she was 16 years old.

==Athletics career==
Pérec first represented France in the 200 metres event at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, reaching the quarter-finals. She won the 400metres world title at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo and repeated the feat at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg. She won her first Olympic gold medal in the 400metres event at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

She entered the 200metres and 400metres events at the 1996 Atlanta Games and won both, achieving the second-ever Olympic 200metres/400metres gold medal double, after Valerie Brisco-Hooks in Los Angeles 1984. Pérec won the 400metres title in an Olympic record time of 48.25 seconds, which ranked her as the third-fastest woman of all time. It took another 23 years before Salwa Eid Naser, in October 2019, surpassed her mark to demote Pérec to fourth in the list of world&#x27;s fastest-ever female 400-metre sprinters.

In addition to her Olympic and World titles, Pérec won the 400metres title and was part of the gold medal-winning 4×400metres relay team at the 1994 European Championships in Helsinki. The two 1996 Olympic golds were Pérec&#x27;s last international titles. In 1997, she shifted to the 200metres but withdrew at the semi-finals stage in the World Championships that year after sustaining a thigh muscle injury while warming up. She was diagnosed with glandular fever in March 1998, and the long recovery forced her to take time out from competitions until the following year.

On 8July 2000, having not run a 400metres race since 1996, Pérec began her Olympic title defence by finishing third in Nice (at the Nikaia meeting of the 2000 IAAF Grand Prix), behind eventual Olympic silver and bronze medalists Lorraine Graham and Katharine Merry. This was the last significant race Pérec took part in. On 22September 2000, she pulled out of the 200metres and 400metres events of the 2000 Sydney Games, several days before they were due to start. Pérec claimed that she had been threatened and insulted several times since arriving in Australia and that the local press, who were supporting Australian athlete Cathy Freeman, had been trying to sabotage her chances of winning 400metres gold.

Pérec trained in Los Angeles with the HSI track team and is listed as a legend on the team&#x27;s page. She officially retired from competitive athletics in June 2004 at the age of 36.

==Life after retirement from athletics==
Pérec enrolled in the top French business school ESSEC and graduated in 2007 with a Master&#x27;s in Sports Management.

She is a member of the &#x27;Champions for Peace&#x27; club, a group of more than 70 famous elite athletes committed to promoting peace in the world through sports, created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organisation.

On 21 October 2012, Pérec was elected president of the Ligue Régionale d&#x27;Athlétisme de la Guadeloupe, the governing body for athletics in Guadeloupe.

Pérec participated in the French reality music competition &quot;Mask Singer&quot; as the Red Panther, performing Stromae&#x27;s &quot;Papaoutai&quot; and Angèle&#x27;s &quot;Balance ton quoi&quot; before being eliminated in the first episode.

On 26 July 2024, Pérec and judoka Teddy Riner lit the Olympic cauldron at the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Paris.

==Family==
Pérec&#x27;s partner is French freestyle skier Sébastien Foucras. They have one child, a son named Nolan, born on 30March 2010.

==Awards==
Pérec was chosen as the French Champion of Champions in 1992 and 1996 by the French sports daily &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;.

On 9 October 2013, she was awarded the Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur by French President François Hollande in the Élysée Palace. Just before presenting the insignia to Pérec during the award ceremony, Hollande described her as &quot;one of the most brilliant athletes in the history of French athletics&quot;. She had received the Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1996.

Pérec was inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame in November 2013.

<text>Eilat ( , ; ; ) is Israel&#x27;s southernmost city, with a population of , a busy port and popular resort at the northern tip of the Red Sea, on what is known in Israel as the Gulf of Eilat and in Jordan as the Gulf of Aqaba. The city is considered a tourist destination for domestic and international tourists heading to Israel.

Eilat is located at the southernmost tip of Israel, at the southern end of the Arabah and the Negev Desert, adjacent to the Egyptian resort city of Taba to the south, the Jordanian port city of Aqaba to the east, and within sight of Haql, Saudi Arabia, across the gulf to the southeast.

Eilat hosts numerous hotels, holiday resorts, and beaches. Its renown coral reefs make it a popular destination for diving tourism, with activities such as snorkeling and scuba diving. The city&#x27;s shopping centers benefit from its status as a tax-free zone. Notable attractions include the Dolphin Reef, where visitors can swim with dolphins; the Coral Beach Nature Reserve, the northernmost shallow coral reef on Earth; the Coral World Underwater Observatory, the Ice Mall, and the city&#x27;s marina and sea-side promenade, home to many bars, restaurants and shops. The city also offers opportunities for hiking and exploration in nearby natural reserves like Timna Valley Park and the Eilat Mountains. 

Eilat&#x27;s arid desert climate and low humidity are moderated by proximity to a warm sea. Temperatures often exceed in summer, and in winter, while water temperatures range between . Eilat averages 360 sunny days a year.

==Name==
The name &quot;Eilat&quot; was given to the abandoned frontier post of &quot;Umm al-Rashrāsh&quot; () in 1949 by the Committee for the Designation of Place-Names in the Negev, referring to Elath, a location in the vicinity mentioned multiple times in the Hebrew Bible, notably as a station during the Israelites&#x27; exodus from Egypt, a site where King Solomon built ships, which was later rebuilt by Uzziah of Judah. The ancient site is possibly located at Tell el-Kheleifeh, an archaeological site situated halfway between modern Eilat and Aqaba, on the Jordanian side of the border.

==Geography==
The geology and landscape are varied: igneous and metamorphic rocks, sandstone and limestone; mountains up to above sea level; broad valleys such as the Arava, and seashore on the Gulf of Aqaba. With an annual average rainfall of and summer temperatures of and higher, water resources and vegetation are limited. &quot;The main elements that influenced the region&#x27;s history were the copper resources and other minerals, the ancient international roads that crossed the area, and its geopolitical and strategic position. These resulted in a settlement density that defies the environmental conditions.&quot;
==History==
===Early history===
Archaeological excavations uncovered impressive prehistoric (Neolithic) tombs dating to the 7th millennium BC at the western edge of Eilat, while nearby copper workings and mining operations at Timna Valley are one of the oldest on earth.

An Islamic community of 250–400 residents flourished for one or two generations in the area during the Umayyad period. It dealt in agriculture, copper mining and smelting, as well as trading with pilgrims by taking advantage of the adjacent &quot;Darb el-Hajj&quot; (&#x27;Way of the Hajj&#x27;) route in the 8th century CE. There was some sporadic reuse of the abandoned site by pastoralists during the 9th. It was one of six very similar contemporary villages discovered in close vicinity, two along the northbound leg of the &quot;Darb&quot;, and three to the southwest, along the coastal road, all of them depending on the nearby port of Ayla and the Hajj road. Its remains were found and excavated in 1989, between the industrial zone at the northern edge of Eilat and nearby Kibbutz Eilot.

===Modern city===
During the British Mandate era, a British police post existed in the area, which was known as &quot;Umm Al-Rashrash&quot;. The area was designated as part of the Jewish state in the 1947 UN Partition Plan. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the abandoned police post, which consisted of five clay huts, was taken without a fight on March 10, 1949, as part of Operation Uvda. This marked the end of Israel&#x27;s war for independence. The memorial at the historical place of March 1949 was declared a National Heritage Site in 1994.

The town developed over the following years. Eilat Airport was built in 1949 and individual ships began arriving in the 1950s, but as there were no dedicated port facilities they unloaded their goods at sea. In the early 1950s, Eilat was a small and remote town, populated largely by port workers, soldiers, and former prisoners. The town&#x27;s development accelerated in 1955, when it had a population of about 500. The Timna Copper Mines near the Timna Valley and the Port of Eilat were opened that year and concerted effort by the Israeli government to populate Eilat began, starting with Jewish immigrant families from Morocco being resettled there. Eilat began to develop rapidly after the Suez Crisis in 1956, with its tourism industry in particular starting to flourish. The Israeli Navy&#x27;s Eilat naval base was founded that year. The town&#x27;s population grew to 5,300 in 1961. Yoseftal Medical Center and the Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline were completed in 1968, and the population increased further, reaching 13,100 in 1972 and 18,900 in 1983.

After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War Arab countries maintained a state of hostility with Israel, blocking all land routes; Israel&#x27;s access to and trade with the rest of the world was by air and sea alone. Further, Egypt denied passage through the Suez Canal to Israeli-registered ships or to any ship carrying cargo to or from Israeli ports. This made Eilat and its sea port crucial to Israel&#x27;s communications, commerce and trade with Africa and Asia, and for oil imports. Without recourse to a port on the Red Sea Israel would have been unable to develop its diplomatic, cultural and trade ties beyond the Mediterranean basin and Europe. This happened in 1956 and again in 1967, when Egypt&#x27;s closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping effectively blockaded the port of Eilat. In 1956, this led to Israel&#x27;s participation alongside Britain and France in the war against Egypt sparked by the Suez Crisis, while in 1967, 90% of Israeli oil passed through the Straits of Tiran. Oil tankers that were due to pass through the straits were delayed. The straits&#x27; closure was cited by Israel as an additional &quot;casus belli&quot; leading to the outbreak of the Six-Day War. Following peace treaties signed with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994, Eilat&#x27;s borders with its neighbors were finally opened.

====Israeli–Arab conflict====
Eilat is especially defended by its own special forces unit LOTAR Eilat. It is a reservist special forces unit of the IDF trained in counter-terrorism and hostage rescue in the Eilat area, which has taken part in many counter-terrorist missions in the region since its formation in 1974. The Lotar unit is composed solely of reservists, citizens who must be Eilat residents between the ages of 20 and 60, who are on call in case of a terrorist attack on the city. It is one of only three units in the IDF authorized to free hostages on its own command. In 2007 the Eilat bakery bombing killed three civilian bakers. This was the first such attack in Eilat proper, although other terror attacks had been carried out in the area.

In 2011, terrorists infiltrated Israel across the Sinai border to execute multiple attacks on Highway 12, including a civilian bus and private car a few miles north of Eilat, in what became known as the 2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks.

In order to prevent terrorist infiltration of Israel from the Sinai, Israel has built the Egypt–Israel barrier, a steel barrier equipped with cameras, radar and motion sensors along the country&#x27;s southern border. The fence was completed in January 2013.

During the Israel-Hamas War and ensuing Red Sea crisis, the port saw an 85% reduction in volumes and by 12 July 2024 the port of Eilat declared bankruptcy resulting in it seeing no economic activity or revenue for eight months.

====Future development plans====
In July 2012, Israel signed an agreement with China to cooperate in building the high-speed railway to Eilat, a railway line which will serve both passenger and freight trains. It will link Eilat with Beersheba and Tel Aviv, and will run through the Arava Valley and Nahal Zin (see Zin Desert).

The former Eilat Airport was closed on 18 March 2019 after the opening of Ramon Airport. The land occupied by the former airport is to be redeveloped. The new Ramon Airport opened in January 2019, north of Eilat and replaced both Eilat Airport and the civilian use of Ovda Airport. Hotels and apartment buildings, containing a total of 2,080 hotel rooms and 1,000 apartments will be constructed on the site, as well as 275 dunams of public space and pedestrian paths. The plans also set aside space for the railway line and an underground railway station. The plan&#x27;s goal is to create an urban continuum between the city center and North Beach, as well as tighten the links between the city&#x27;s neighborhoods, which were separated by the airport.

In addition, there are plans to move the Port of Eilat and the Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline terminal to the northern part of the city, as well as to turn it into a university town of science and research, and brand it an international sports city. All these projects are part of a plan to increase Eilat&#x27;s population to 150,000 people and build 35,000 hotel rooms.

==Climate==
Eilat has a hot desert climate (Köppen: &quot;BWh&quot;) with very hot, dry summers and warm, similarly dry winters. Winters are usually between . Summers are usually between . There are relatively small coral reefs near Eilat; however, 50 years ago they were much larger.


==Demographics==

The overwhelming majority of Eilat&#x27;s population are Jews. Arabs constitute about 4% of the population. Eilat&#x27;s population includes a large number of foreign workers, estimated at over 10,000 working as caregivers, hotel workers and in the construction trades. Eilat also has a growing Israeli Arab population, as well as many affluent Jordanians and Egyptians who visit Eilat in the summer months.

In 2007, over 200 Sudanese refugees from Egypt who arrived in Israel illegally on foot were given work and allowed to stay in Eilat.

==Education==
The educational system of Eilat accommodates more than 9,000 children in eight day-care centers, 67 pre-kindergartens and kindergartens, 10 elementary schools, and 3 six-year high schools. Also, there are some special-education schools and religious schools. Ben Gurion University of the Negev maintains a campus in Eilat. The Eilat branch has 1,100 students, about 75 percent from outside the city. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, also maintains a campus in Eilat. In 2010, a new student dormitory was funded and built by the Jewish Federation of Toronto, the Rashi Foundation, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and the municipality of Eilat. The SPNI&#x27;s Eilat Field School on the outskirts of Eilat offers special hiking tours that focus on desert ecology, the Red Sea, bird migration and other aspects of Eilat&#x27;s flora and fauna. The Hesder Yeshiva Ayelet Hashachar, is based in Eilat, established in 1997.

==Healthcare==
Yoseftal Medical Center, established in 1968, is Israel&#x27;s southernmost hospital, and the only hospital covering the southern Negev. With 65 beds, the hospital is Israel&#x27;s smallest. Special services geared to the Red Sea region are a hyperbaric chamber to treat victims of diving accidents and kidney dialysis facilities open to vacationing tourists.
==Transportation==
===Air===
Since 2019, Ramon International Airport has handled commercial domestic and international flights to Eilat (IATA: ETM, ICAO: LLER).

====Former airports====
* Eilat Airport is located in the city centre and was used largely for domestic flights (IATA: ETH, ICAO: LLET). The former site is to be redeveloped.
* International flights often used Ovda International Airport some northwest of the city (IATA: VDA, ICAO: LLOV). While no civilian flights use the airport any longer, it remains in use as a military airbase and for aircraft storage.

===Road===
Eilat has two main roads connecting it with the center of Israel - Route 12, which leads North West, and Route 90 which leads North East, and South West to the border crossing with Egypt. 

====Bus====
Egged, the national bus company, provides regular service to points north on an almost hourly basis as well as in-city on a half-hourly basis during daylight hours. In part due to the comparatively long travel times, there are different booking procedures for buses to Eilat, including the option of advance reservations.

===Border crossings with Egypt and Jordan===
* The Taba Border Crossing allows crossing to and from Taba, Egypt.
* The Wadi Araba Crossing, renamed the Yitzhak Rabin Border Crossing on the Israeli side, allows crossing to and from Aqaba, Jordan.

===Maritime===
The Port of Eilat and Eilat Marina allow travel by sea.

=== Rail===
Future plans also call for a rail link, sometimes referred to as the Med-Red to decrease travel times substantially from Eilat to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, via the existing line at Beer Sheba; planning is underway. As of 2021 Dimona railway station is the southernmost passenger train station in Israel.
==Economy==
In the 1970s tourism became increasingly important to the city&#x27;s economy as other industries shut down or were drastically reduced. Today tourism is the city&#x27;s major source of income, although Eilat became a free trade zone in 1985.

===Tourism===
Eilat offers a wide range of accommodations, from hostels and luxury hotels to Bedouin hospitality. In recent years Eilat has been the target of militants from Egypt and Gaza causing a reduced tourist inflow to the region. Attractions include:

*Birdwatching and ringing station: Eilat is located on the main migration route between Africa and Europe. International Birding &amp; Research Center in Eilat.
*Camel tours
*Coral Beach Nature Reserve, an underwater marine reserve of tropical marine flora and fauna
*Coral World Underwater Observatory, located at the southern tip of Coral Beach, it has aquaria, a museum, simulation rides, and shark, turtle, and stingray tanks. The observatory is the biggest public aquarium in the Middle East.
*Dolphin Reef, a marine biology and research station where visitors can swim and interact with dolphins
*Freefall parachuting.
*Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve, established in the 1960s to conserve endangered species, including Biblical animals, from this and similar regions. The reserve has a visitors&#x27; center, care and treatment enclosures, and large open area where desert animals are acclimated before re-introduction into the wild. Hai-Bar efforts have successfully re-introduced the Asian wild ass, or onager, into the Negev. The Hai-Bar Nature Reserve and animal re-introduction program were described in Bill Clark&#x27;s book &quot;High Hills and Wild Goats: Life Among the Animals of the Hai-Bar Wildlife Refuge&quot;. The book also describes life in Eilat and the surrounding area.
*Marina, with some 250 yacht berths
*Timna Valley Park, the oldest copper mines in the world; Egyptian temple of Hathor, King Solomon&#x27;s Pillars sandstone formation, ancient pit mines and rock art
*&quot;What&#x27;s Up&quot;, a portable astronomical observatory with programs in the desert and on the promenade
*Ice Mall, ice skating rink and shopping mall

===Dive tourism===

Skin and scuba diving equipment is for hire on or near all major beaches. Scuba diving equipment rental and compressed air are available from diving clubs and schools all year round. Eilat is located in the Gulf of Aqaba, one of the most popular diving destinations in the world. The coral reefs along Eilat&#x27;s coast remain relatively pristine and the area is recognized as one of the prime diving locations in the world. About 250,000 dives are performed annually in Eilat&#x27;s coastline, and diving represents 10% of the tourism income of this area. In addition, given the proximity of many of these reefs to the shore, non-divers can encounter the Red Sea&#x27;s reefs with relative ease. Water conditions for SCUBA divers are good all year round, with water temperatures around , with little or no currents and clear waters with an average of visibility.

=== Museums ===
* Eilat City Museum
* Eilat Art Gallery

===Film===
Eilat has been utilized by film and television productions – domestic and foreign – for location shooting since the 1960s, most notably in the early 90s as a tropical locale for season 2 of the Canadian production &quot;Tropical Heat&quot;.

It was also used in the films &quot;She&quot;, &quot;Madron&quot;, &quot;Ashanti&quot; and &quot;Rambo III&quot;.

==Archaeology==
Despite harsh conditions, the region has supported large populations as far back as 8,000 BCE. Several Neolithic sites have been discovered in Eilat in its vicinity. One of them is a late Neolithic burial site with fan scrapers, dated by archaeologists to 5410-4250 BCE.

Exploration of ancient sites began in 1861, but only 7% of the area has undergone serious archaeological excavation. Some 1,500 ancient sites are located in a area. In contrast to the gaps found in settlement periods in the neighbouring Negev Highlands and Sinai, these sites show continuous settlement for the past 10,000 years.

<text>Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima (; born 18 September 1976), mononymously known as Ronaldo, is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is the owner and president of La Liga club Real Valladolid. Nicknamed (&#x27;The Phenomenon&#x27;) and R9, he is considered one of the greatest players of all time. As a multi-functional striker who brought a new dimension to the position, Ronaldo has been an influence for a generation of strikers that have followed. His individual accolades include being named FIFA World Player of the Year three times and winning two Ballon d&#x27;Or awards.

Ronaldo started his career at Cruzeiro and moved to PSV in 1994. He joined Barcelona in 1996 for a then world record transfer fee and at 20 years old, he was named the 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year, making him the youngest recipient of the award. In 1997, Inter Milan broke the world record fee to sign Ronaldo, making him the first player since Diego Maradona to break the world transfer record twice. At 21, he received the 1997 Ballon d&#x27;Or and remains the youngest recipient of the award. By the age of 23, Ronaldo had scored over 200 goals for club and country. However, after a series of knee injuries and recuperation, he was inactive for almost three years. Ronaldo joined Real Madrid in 2002 and won the 2002–03 La Liga title. He had spells at AC Milan and Corinthians before retiring in 2011, having suffered further injuries.

Ronaldo played for Brazil in 98 matches, scoring 62 goals and is the third-highest goalscorer for his national team. At age 17, he was the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the 1994 FIFA World Cup. At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo received the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament after he helped Brazil reach the final, where he suffered a convulsive fit hours before kick-off. He won the 2002 FIFA World Cup, starring in a front three with Ronaldinho and Rivaldo. Ronaldo scored twice in the final and received the Golden Boot as the tournament&#x27;s top goalscorer. This achievement, viewed as &quot;redemption&quot; for what occurred at the previous World Cup, saw Ronaldo named the 2002 FIFA World Player of the Year, receive the 2002 Ballon d&#x27;Or, and for his return from injury, won the Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored his 15th World Cup goal, a tournament record at the time. He also won the 1997 Copa América, where he became the player of the tournament and the 1999 Copa América, where he was the top goalscorer.

Ronaldo was one of the most marketable sportsmen in the world during his playing career. He was named in the FIFA 100 list of the greatest living players compiled in 2004 by Pelé and was inducted into the Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame, Italian Football Hall of Fame, Inter Milan Hall of Fame and Real Madrid Hall of Fame. In 2020, Ronaldo was named in the Ballon d&#x27;Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI published by &quot;France Football&quot; magazine. Ronaldo has continued his work as a United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador, a position to which he was appointed in 2000. Ronaldo became the majority owner of Real Valladolid in September 2018, after buying 51% of the club&#x27;s shares. In December 2021, he bought a controlling stake in his boyhood club Cruzeiro, investing $70 million in the club. He sold his stake in Cruzeiro in April 2024.

==Early life==
Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima was born on 18 September 1976 in Itaguaí as the third child of Nélio Nazário de Lima Snr. and Sônia dos Santos Barata. Ronaldo has a brother, Nélio Jr. His parents separated when he was 11, and Ronaldo dropped out of school shortly afterward to pursue a career in football. He played on the streets of Bento Ribeiro, a suburb of Rio de Janeiro. His mother states: &quot;I always found him on the street playing ball with friends when he should have been in school. I know, I lost my battle.&quot; He joined the Social Ramos futsal team at the age of 12 and led the city&#x27;s youth league in scoring with a record 166 goals in his first season which included scoring 11 of his team&#x27;s 12 goals in a single game. Crediting futsal for developing his skills, Ronaldo has said, &quot;futsal will always be my first love.&quot; His coach from Social Ramos, Alirio Carvalho, says: &quot;What was special about Ronaldo was his attitude. It was as if he had come from the moon. Nothing disturbed him, nothing overawed him, nothing threw him off his game.&quot;

Spotted by former Brazilian player Jairzinho, who was coaching São Cristóvão, Ronaldo played for the São Cristóvão youth team. Under the guidance of coach Alfredo Sampaio, he progressed quickly through the ranks, playing for the clubs&#x27; under-17 and under-20 teams while only 15. Ronaldo&#x27;s agents in Brazil, Reinaldo Pitta and Alexandre Martins, signed him as a 13-year-old. Pitta stated: &quot;We saw right away that he could be something different than most other players.&quot; Recognized as a child prodigy, Jairzinho recommended the then 16-year-old to his former club Cruzeiro.

==Club career==
===Cruzeiro===
Ronaldo quickly attracted attention from big clubs, and his agents rejected offers from Botafogo and São Paulo. He was turned down by Flamengo, the team he supported as a boy, after missing practice due to an inability to afford the fare for the hour-long bus ride. Jairzinho saw Ronaldo&#x27;s potential and helped get him a move to Cruzeiro. Ronaldo&#x27;s agents accepted an offer of €50,000 from the club, and he scored four goals on his youth team debut.

Three months after arriving at Cruzeiro, Ronaldo made his professional debut on 25 May 1993 against Caldense in the Minas Gerais State Championship. His first senior goal came in a friendly during a tour of Portugal, scoring a goal against Belenenses and generally impressing new coach Carlos Alberto Silva, enough to become a first team regular. During the tour, his performance against Porto impressed enough that they bid $500,000, which was turned down by club president César Masci.

Upon returning from the 1993 summer tour, he would score 20 goals in 21 games for Cruzeiro until the end of the year. On 5 October 1993 he scored his first senior career hat-trick against Chilean side Colo-Colo (6–1) in the first home leg of the Supercopa Libertadores. He scored two more in the second leg, further three against Uruguayan team Nacional, and finished as the tournament&#x27;s top-scorer with 8 goals, being the youngest to do so in the history of the Supercopa Libertadores.

On 7 November 1993 he came to national public attention once more by scoring five goals in Cruzeiro&#x27;s 6–0 home win against Bahia in the 1993 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A and became the second youngest South-American in history to score a league hat-trick behind Pelé.

Ronaldo scored a total of 44 goals in 47 games with Cruzeiro in two seasons, leading them to their first Copa do Brasil in 1993, and the Minas Gerais State Championship in 1994.

===PSV===
Ronaldo joined PSV after the 1994 World Cup. He was selected for the tournament despite being just 17, but did not play in any games. His Brazil teammate Romário having played for PSV from 1988 to 1993 advised Ronaldo to move to the club. On 28 August 1994, Ronaldo scored ten minutes into his debut against Vitesse, and scored a brace on his home debut against Go Ahead Eagles. He scored 30 league goals in his first season in the Netherlands, which included seven braces and a hat-trick against Utrecht. After scoring a hat-trick in PSV&#x27;s game against Bayer Leverkusen in the 1994–95 UEFA Cup, Leverkusen striker and Germany World Cup winner Rudi Völler stated in a post match press conference, &quot;Never in my life have I seen an 18-year-old play in this way.&quot; His dribbles from midfield caught the attention of many in the sport, with future Barcelona teammate Luis Enrique stating, &quot;I&#x27;d seen him on television at PSV and thought ‘wow&#x27;. Then he came to Barcelona. He&#x27;s the most spectacular player I&#x27;ve ever seen. He did things I&#x27;d never seen before. We&#x27;re now used to seeing Messi dribble past six players, but not then. Ronaldo was a beast.&quot;

Nick Miller, match reporter for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, writes: &quot;What&#x27;s striking about Ronaldo in that first year at PSV is how complete he looks, even as a skinny teenager. Everything that would come to define him – the lightning pace, the blurry stepovers, the implausible impression that he was faster with the ball than without it, even the exceptional upper-body strength – was all there.&quot; Rob Smyth added, &quot;In many ways Ronaldo was the first PlayStation footballer. His stepover was a form of hypnosis, and his signature trick, the elastico, could certainly have come from a computer screen.&quot; Ronaldo&#x27;s second season was marred by a knee injury which kept him out of most of the campaign, but he still averaged nearly a goal a game, scoring 19 goals in 21 appearances, including a UEFA Cup four-goal haul against Finnish side MyPa. With PSV, Ronaldo won the Dutch Cup in 1996 and he was Eredivisie top scorer in 1995. In his two seasons at the club he scored 54 goals in 58 games.

===Barcelona===
During his spell at PSV, Ronaldo attracted the attention of both Inter Milan and Barcelona. It was Barcelona that was willing to pay the then-world record fee of $19.5 million, and he joined the club on 17 July 1996. According to manager Bobby Robson, he signed an eight-year contract, and would play up front alone.

During the 1996–97 season, Ronaldo scored 47 goals in 49 games in all competitions, with his goal celebration invariably the same with his arms outstretched like the statue of &quot;Christ the Redeemer&quot; that watches over his native Rio de Janeiro. He helped Barcelona to the 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup title, capping the season with the winning goal in the final, and to a win in the 1996 Supercopa de España. He also won La Liga top scorer award in 1997 with 34 goals in 37 games, and the European Golden Shoe. Until the 2008–09 season, Ronaldo remained the last player to score more than 30 goals in La Liga.

Ronaldo was at his physical peak at Barcelona, and many of his 47 goals involved him rounding the goalkeeper before slotting the ball into the net. By January 1997, at 20 years old, he was touted to be the next &quot;great&quot; in football, being viewed as the heir to Pelé, Diego Maradona, Johan Cruyff and Marco van Basten. Speaking to &quot;The New York Times&quot; regarding Ronaldo later that season, Robson said &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a player at 20 have so much&quot;. &quot;World Soccer&quot; featured Ronaldo on its cover in the same year under the headline &#x27;The Best Ever?&#x27;. Óscar García, Ronaldo&#x27;s teammate that season, stated, &quot;Back then, he was all fibre and muscle. He was a perfect physical specimen. Such incredible power matched to his technical skills could make him unstoppable.&quot; José Mourinho, who worked as an interpreter at Barcelona, referred to Ronaldo as &quot;the greatest player I have ever seen in my life&quot;, adding, &quot;I have no doubts. Ronaldo is the best my eyes have seen&quot;, and in 2014 regarded him as the best player post-Diego Maradona.

Arguably, Ronaldo&#x27;s most memorable Barcelona goal was scored at Compostela on 11 October 1996; having received the ball inside his own half, he evaded a cynical tackle of the first opponent with a drag back, before running away from another and ran towards goal, going past two more defenders in the box with close ball control, before finishing into the bottom corner of the net. The camera then cut to manager Robson who had got up off the bench and clasped his head in disbelief at what he had seen. The footage of the goal was later used in a Nike advert with a voiceover asking: &quot;Imagine you asked God to be the best player in the world, and he listened to you&quot;, and the goal was said to have been replayed 160 times on the main Spanish television channels in the 48 hours following the game. Half-way through the season, Barcelona agreed in principle to extend his contract to 2006, doubling his salary in the process. A hat-trick against Valencia, the third goal of which saw him dissect two Valencia defenders before striking the ball into the net, saw Barcelona fans waving white handkerchiefs as an expression of admiration for an exceptional performance. Sid Lowe of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; stated: &quot;That season Ronaldo was unstoppable. He was slim and powerful, skillful, fast and deadly. He was ridiculously good.&quot; At the end of 1996, aged 20, Ronaldo became the youngest player to win FIFA World Player of the Year.

===Inter Milan===
====1997–1999: World record transfer and Ballon d&#x27;Or win====
Ronaldo&#x27;s time at Barcelona lasted one season, as there were problems with the renegotiation of his contract. Barcelona thought there was an agreement in place, with Barcelona president Josep Lluís Núñez saying &quot;He&#x27;s ours for life&quot;, but when the parties reconvened the following day, the agreement collapsed, with Núñez admitting: &quot;It&#x27;s all over, Ronaldo is going&quot;. Speaking to ESPN, Ronaldo stated, &quot;I had reached an agreement to renew my contract just a month before that season finished, but a week later the lawyer and the president of Barcelona agreed that that contract was absurd.&quot; Paying the buy out clause fee in his contract, Inter Milan signed him in the summer of 1997 for a then world record fee of $27 million, making him the second player, after Diego Maradona, to break the world transfer record twice. He signed a five-year contract with the Italians, and was unveiled to 4000 Inter fans at their training ground. His debut came on 27 July during the pre-season fixture against Manchester United. His competitive debut came on the opening day of the 1997–98 season against Brescia.

Ronaldo adapted to the Italian style of the game in his first season, finishing with 25 Serie A goals, and was named Serie A Footballer of the Year. Ronaldo started to develop into a complete forward. He began racking up assists, became first-choice penalty taker, taking and scoring freekicks. Halfway through his first season he won FIFA World Player of the Year for the second time, and collected the Ballon d&#x27;Or. During his time with Inter, he scored several goals against city rivals AC Milan in the Derby della Madonnina. Ronaldo and prolific Fiorentina striker Gabriel Batistuta were the two best strikers in Serie A, with their duels the most anticipated in Italy. Ronaldo&#x27;s goal celebrations often saw his Inter teammates congratulating him by kneeling down and pretending to shine his shoe. Ronaldo scored a trademark goal against Lazio in the 1998 UEFA Cup Final. Running through defence to go one on one with Lazio goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani, Ronaldo feinted to go right then left, without touching the ball, leaving Marchegiani on his backside, before going right and slotting the ball into the net. His Inter teammate Youri Djorkaeff stated; &quot;Ronaldo was phenomenal. He proved that he was a cut above the rest that season.&quot; After the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where he was named player of the tournament, Ronaldo was widely regarded as the best striker in the world. By the end of the 1998–99 season, he was appointed Inter Milan captain.

====1999–2002: Recurring injury problems====

After two seasons with Inter, A.C. Milan defender Paolo Maldini viewed Ronaldo and Diego Maradona as the two best players he ever faced, stating, &quot;Ronaldo during his first two years at Inter was a phenomenon.&quot; Inter had high hopes going into the 1999–2000 season with their attack including Ronaldo and Italian stars Roberto Baggio and Christian Vieri. However, on 21 November, during a Serie A match against Lecce, Ronaldo felt his knee buckle and was forced to limp off the field. A medical examination confirmed that the striker had ruptured a tendon in his knee and would require surgery. During his first comeback on 12 April 2000, he played only six minutes during the first leg of the Coppa Italia final against Lazio before suffering a complete rupture of the knee-cap tendons. Ronaldo&#x27;s physiotherapist Nilton Petrone stated, &quot;his knee-cap actually exploded&quot;, and called it &quot;the worst football injury&quot; he&#x27;s ever seen.

Ronaldo was forced to miss the entire 2000–01 season and much of the two seasons either side of it. Since his Inter teammate Javier Zanetti had replaced him as the team captain during his absence, he eventually inherited the captain&#x27;s armband in late 2001. After two operations and rehabilitation, Ronaldo came back for the 2002 World Cup, helping Brazil win their fifth World Cup title. Later in 2002, he won the FIFA World Player of the Year award for the third time, and transferred from Inter to Real Madrid. Ronaldo was given his most recognizable nickname, , by the Italian press while playing there. His Inter teammate Djorkaeff stated: &quot;when we were training, we would practically stop to watch him. It was extraordinary.&quot; Prior to his November 1999 injury, Ronaldo had registered 42 goals in 58 Serie A games, in what was the hardest league to score in with the most advanced defensive strategies and the world&#x27;s best defenders. After five years, he had played 99 games and scored 59 goals for &quot;Nerazzurri&quot;. Ronaldo&#x27;s performances at the club – especially the first two seasons before injury – saw him named among the four inaugural inductees into the Inter Milan Hall of Fame in 2018.

===Real Madrid===
====2002–2005: Ballon d&#x27;Or win and La Liga championship====
Having signed for Real Madrid for €46 million, his jersey sales broke all records on the first day. Ronaldo was part of the &quot;Galácticos&quot; era of global stars signed by the club every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Roberto Carlos and David Beckham. He was sidelined through injury until October 2002 which further fuelled fan anticipation. Ronaldo scored twice on his debut against Alavés, the first 61 seconds after coming on. That same reception was observed at the final game of the season against Athletic Bilbao, where Ronaldo scored to finish his first season with 23 league goals and seal La Liga title for 2003. He also won an Intercontinental Cup in 2002 and Supercopa de España in 2003, scoring in both finals.

In the second leg of Real Madrid&#x27;s Champions League quarter-final, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick against Manchester United at Old Trafford, knocking the English team out of the competition. Completing his hat-trick with a swerving strike from 30 yards, Ronaldo was substituted off after 67 minutes, and was given a standing ovation from both sets of fans. Reflecting on the ovation given to him from the oppositions&#x27; fans, Ronaldo stated that &quot;it remains a very beautiful, very special moment&quot;. Manchester United defender Wes Brown commented: &quot;He was just unstoppable. A young Ronaldo [before a series of injuries] would have been even more dangerous, but it shows how good a player he was. Whenever he wanted to turn it on he could, on any stage, in any stadium&quot;. Ronaldo scored in a 2–1 home win over Juventus in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals, but injury crucially kept him out of most of the second leg defeat where Real were eliminated.

In the 2003–04 season, Madrid were on track to win the treble, until Ronaldo was injured towards the end of the season; they subsequently lost the Copa del Rey final, were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals to Monaco, and suffered a league form breakdown. During that second season at the club, Ronaldo scored one of the fastest goals in the club&#x27;s history when he netted after 15 seconds in a league match against Atlético Madrid at the Bernabéu on 3 December 2003. Three days later he helped to ensure Real&#x27;s first league victory over Barcelona at the Nou Camp in 20 years when he scored the second goal in a 2–1 victory over his former club. He finished the season as La Liga&#x27;s top scorer with 25 goals and received the Pichichi Trophy for a second time, despite Madrid losing the league title to Valencia.

====2005–2007: Final two seasons ====
In his final two seasons at Real Madrid, Ronaldo missed a number of games with injuries and weight issues, and with the acquisition of Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2006, he grew further out of favour with the manager Fabio Capello. Speaking in 2017 on Ronaldo&#x27;s weight issues and lack of fitness at Madrid, in addition to his ability, Capello summed up the conflicting emotions he has with the Brazilian: &quot;The most difficult player to handle was the best I coached: Ronaldo, il Fenomeno.&quot;

In four and a half seasons at the club, Ronaldo scored over a century of goals, becoming the fifth foreigner at Madrid to achieve the feat after Argentine Alfredo Di Stéfano, Hungarian Ferenc Puskás, Mexican Hugo Sánchez and Chilean Iván Zamorano. Although the knee injuries before 2002 meant he &quot;was robbed of the explosiveness of his early years&quot; (according to &quot;FourFourTwo&quot;) by the time he signed for Real Madrid, Ronaldo was named by &quot;Marca&quot; as a member of the &quot;Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid&#x27;s history&quot;.

While past his 1990s prime, Ronaldo still drew praise from his Madrid colleagues, with Zidane stating: &quot;Without hesitation, Ronaldo is the best player I ever played with or against. He had such an ease with the ball. Every day I trained with him, I saw something different, something new, something beautiful.&quot; Michael Owen, who joined Madrid in 2004, acknowledged that he never got the chance to play with Ronaldo in his prime when &quot;he had absolute blistering speed and strength, mesmerizing foot speed, he was just a blur, he&#x27;d be that fast&quot;, before adding, &quot;even in training, he showed more than enough to convince me that I would have loved to play with him at his peak.&quot; Teammates for six months, Van Nistelrooy said: &quot;Ronaldo was the best natural talent I ever played with. His innate ability went beyond anything that I&#x27;d ever seen or played alongside.&quot;

=== AC Milan ===
On 18 January 2007, it was reported that Ronaldo agreed terms with Milan for a transfer of €8.05 million. Departing Real Madrid, having been the club&#x27;s leading goalscorer for all of his four full seasons, Ronaldo thanked everyone except Capello: &quot;I would like to thank the fans who&#x27;ve supported me all the time and thank all the teammates that I&#x27;ve had here and all the coaches I&#x27;ve had – except one&quot;. Capello, who dropped him due to weight issues, commented: &quot;I wish him the best of luck in doing what he used to do which is being a great player.&quot; On 25 January, Ronaldo flew from Madrid to Milan, with statements on the club&#x27;s website stating Ronaldo was in Milan for a medical, and that a meeting had been arranged with Real Madrid officials to discuss and finalize his transfer to the Milanese club. On 26 January, Ronaldo successfully completed his medical tests at the Milanello training complex under the supervision of club doctors, and the transfer was completed on 30 January. Wearing the number 99 jersey, he made his debut as a substitute on 11 February 2007 in the 2–1 victory over Livorno. The next game at Siena, on 17 February, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted on a third goal in his first start for Milan, as they won 4–3. In his first season, Ronaldo scored seven goals in 14 appearances.

After his move to Milan, Ronaldo joined the list of the few players to have played for both Inter Milan and AC Milan in the Derby della Madonnina, and is one of few players to have scored for both rival teams in the Milan derby game (for Inter in the 1998–99 season and for AC Milan in the 2006–07 season), the others being players such as Giuseppe Meazza, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Enrico Candiani and Aldo Cevenini. Ronaldo is also one of the few players to have started for Real Madrid and Barcelona, which also boasts a heated rivalry. Ronaldo, however, has never transferred directly between rival clubs. Ronaldo only played 300-plus minutes in his second season at Milan due to recurring injury problems and weight issues. Ronaldo&#x27;s only goals in the 2007–08 season, besides his goal against Lecce in pre-season, came in a 5–2 victory against Napoli at the San Siro, where he scored an emotional double. It was also the first time Milan&#x27;s much hyped attacking trio of Kaká, Alexandre Pato and Ronaldo, known as &quot;Ka-Pa-Ro&quot;, played together.

Despite tremendous success over the past decade, Ronaldo never won the UEFA Champions League in his club career. In 2019, &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; named him the best player never to win the competition; in 2020, Sky Sports ranked him the second-best player (after Diego Maradona) never to win the Champions League or European Cup. Ronaldo stated: &quot;I live football with a passion that doesn&#x27;t give me any peace for not winning the Champions League – it&#x27;s a trophy everyone would love to win.&quot; In 2011, Paul Wilson wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Ronaldo was unlucky in his timing or his choice of club – for there is no doubt that at his very best he would have walked into any club in the world.&quot; During the 2006–07 season, though Milan won the 2006–07 title, Ronaldo was cup-tied with Madrid and ineligible to take part. The closest that he came to Champions League success was in 2003 when he helped Real Madrid to the semi-finals, in which they lost to Juventus.

On 13 February 2008, Ronaldo suffered a severe season-ending knee injury while jumping for a cross in Milan 1–1 draw with Livorno, and was stretchered off and taken to a hospital. The club confirmed after the match that Ronaldo had ruptured the kneecap ligament in his left knee. It marked the third such occurrence of this injury, which he suffered twice to his right knee in 1999 and 2000. Teammate Clarence Seedorf stated: &quot;My heart stopped beating because it was like watching a repeat of the injury he suffered playing for Inter Milan against Lazio [in 2000]. His reaction was the same.&quot; Silvio Berlusconi told Italy&#x27;s RAI TV: &quot;He fears for his career. I called him last evening and told him to believe in himself. He has enormous physical potential.&quot; Ronaldo was released by Milan at the end of the season, as his contract expired and was not renewed.

===Corinthians===
====2009–2010: Paulistão and Copa do Brasil====
Ronaldo trained with Rio de Janeiro based Brazilian club Flamengo during his recovery from knee surgery, and the club&#x27;s board of directors said that the doors were open for him to join. On 9 December, however, Ronaldo signed a one-year deal with Flamengo&#x27;s league rival Corinthians. The announcement received much publicity in the Brazilian press about his choice of Corinthians over Flamengo, since Ronaldo publicly declared himself a Flamengo fan. Rio-based sports newspaper &quot;Lance!&quot; called Ronaldo a &quot;phenomenal traitor&quot;, and some angry fans burned Ronaldo shirts outside the Flamengo headquarters. Ronaldo responded that playing for Corinthians was the only option open to him. &quot;I understand perfectly, I&#x27;m openly a Flamengo fan. But I was training with Flamengo for four months and didn&#x27;t receive any offer. Corinthians made an offer that will let me continue my career.&quot;

Ronaldo played his first match for Corinthians on 4 March 2009, a Copa do Brasil match against Itumbiara at Estádio Juscelino Kubitschek, in which he came as a substitute for Jorge Henrique. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Corinthians on 8 March 2009 in a Campeonato Paulista match against Palmeiras. Scoring eight goals in nine matches, his form led to calls for his return to the Brazil national team – nearly 70% of respondents in a poll for the &quot;O Globo&quot; newspaper voted that he should be reinstated, with the country&#x27;s president Lula also calling for his immediate return. He scored twice in a 3–1 win against local rivals Santos in the first leg of the state championship final, with Santos idol Pelé looking on from the stands. His second goal, a chip over the Santos goalkeeper from 30 yards out, sent the Corinthians fans into hysteria. Ultimately, he helped Corinthians win the Campeonato Paulista with ten goals in 14 games.

Ronaldo scored in Corinthians 4–2 aggregate defeat of Internacional in the final of the 2009 Copa do Brasil, helping the club win the trophy for the third time (the second of his career), thus earning a spot in the Copa Libertadores 2010. Following an injury lay off he returned on 20 September in a match against Goiás, and a week later scored for Corinthians in a draw against São Paulo. He finished the 2009 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A with 12 goals in 20 matches.

====2011: Retirement====
In February 2010, Ronaldo signed a contract extension with Corinthians that would keep him with the club until the end of 2011, and said he would then retire. Commenting on his weight issues following this announcement, Brian Homewood of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated: &quot;Sadly, Ronaldo&#x27;s celebrity is now more of a draw than his skills on the pitch – Coldplay, Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres and actor Hugh Jackman have all visited São Paulo to get a picture with the roly‑poly star.&quot;

In February 2011, after Corinthians were eliminated from the 2011 Copa Libertadores by the Colombian team Deportes Tolima, Ronaldo announced his retirement from football, concluding an 18-year career. In an emotional press conference on 14 February, he cited pain and hypothyroidism as the reasons for his premature retirement. He discovered he had hypothyroidism – a condition which slows down metabolism and causes weight gain – during tests with Milan in 2007.

The player said that the problem could be solved by taking hormones, but this practice is forbidden in football and would lead to a suspension for doping. However, doctors disagree that such treatment would be confused with doping, with some publicly claiming that Ronaldo had lied when he said could not treat his hypothyroidism. Corinthians&#x27; own doctor said that Ronaldo did not have this disease. Hypothyroidism is usually associated with a slight weight gain (eminently due to fluid accumulation, not fat gain) and difficulty getting rid of extra pounds.

Ronaldo admitted his body had finally succumbed to the crippling litany of injuries that had blighted his career: &quot;It&#x27;s very hard to leave something that made me so happy. Mentally I wanted to continue but I have to acknowledge that I lost to my body. The head wants to go on but the body can&#x27;t take any more. I think of an action but I can&#x27;t do it the way I want to. It&#x27;s time to go.&quot;

==International career==
Ronaldo made his international debut for Brazil on 23 March 1994 in a friendly match in Recife against Argentina. His first senior goal for Brazil came on 4 May 1994 in a 3–0 friendly win against Iceland. He went to the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States aged 17, but did not play as Brazil went on to win the tournament. He stated he was &quot;overjoyed&quot; at the experience. He was then known as &quot;Ronaldinho&quot; (&quot;little Ronaldo&quot; in Portuguese), because Ronaldo Rodrigues de Jesus, his older teammate, was also called Ronaldo and later nicknamed &quot;Ronaldão&quot; (&quot;big Ronaldo&quot;) to further distinguish them. Another player, Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, now widely known as Ronaldinho, was called &quot;Ronaldinho Gaúcho&quot; when he joined the Brazil team in 1999.

===Atlanta &#x27;96 and Copa América===
At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Ronaldo used the name &quot;Ronaldinho&quot; again, since centre-back Ronaldo Guiaro, two years his senior, was one of his teammates. Brazil went on to win the bronze medal. Ronaldo also represented Brazil in the 1995 Copa América (finishing second) and won both the 1997 and the 1999 editions of the tournament. He was named player of the tournament in 1997, was the top scorer in 1999 and scored in the finals of both, against Bolivia in 1997 and Uruguay in 1999. He also took part in the friendly Tournoi de France in 1997, preceding the 1998 FIFA World Cup, scoring a goal as Brazil became runners-up. Ronaldo starred alongside Romário, dubbed the &quot;Ro-Ro&quot; attack, at the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, helping Brazil win their first ever Confederations Cup title where he finished as the third-highest scorer with 4 goals, scoring a hat-trick against Australia in the final. On the combination of Ronaldo and Romário, Will Sharp writes: &quot;...to the elation of all those fortunate enough to have watched them, they found themselves together, fated with the opportunity to forge one of the most outrageous offensive pairings the game has ever seen. Their partnership was brief but it was inexplicably brilliant.&quot;

===1998 FIFA World Cup===

Ronaldo entered the 1998 FIFA World Cup billed as the world&#x27;s greatest player by reporters in the sport. Jacob Steinberg of &quot;The Guardian&quot; writes, &quot;In 1998, no one was as ferociously talented as Ronaldo, whose supernatural mixture of power, pace and skill had made him the player every child in the playground wanted to be; at the age of 21, the hopes and dreams of a nation rested on his shoulders.&quot;

Ronaldo scored four goals and made three assists en route to the final, scoring once and assisting Bebeto&#x27;s goal in a 3–0 win against Morocco in the team&#x27;s second group stage match, netting twice in a 4–1 win against Chile in the round of 16, set–up two goals in Brazil&#x27;s 3–2 victory over Denmark in the quarter-finals, and scored once in the 1–1 draw against the Netherlands in the semi-finals, also netting Brazil&#x27;s first penalty in the 4–2 shoot–out victory. Hours before the final against France, Ronaldo suffered a convulsive fit. At first, he was removed from the starting lineup 72 minutes before the match, and the team sheet (with Edmundo as his replacement) was submitted to the FIFA delegate. The starting line up without Ronaldo was released to a stunned world media. The BBC&#x27;s John Motson stated, &quot;The scenes in the commentary box have been absolute mayhem and chaos.&quot; However, shortly before kick off, after pleading that he felt fine and requested to play, Ronaldo was reinstated by Brazil coach Mário Zagallo.

Ronaldo was the last Brazilian player out of the tunnel as the teams entered the field. During the playing of the Brazil national anthem the camera focused on him throughout, with Ronaldo showing little emotion. Steinberg states that Ronaldo &quot;sleepwalked&quot; through the final, which also saw him injured in a collision with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Zagallo admitted the fears over Ronaldo affected his team psychologically, and stated &quot;for the whole of the first half I was wondering whether to take him off&quot;, but feared a public outcry in Brazil had he done so. Brazil lost the match to hosts France 3–0. Ronaldo later reflected: &quot;We lost the World Cup but I won another cup – my life.&quot;

An inquest was launched in Brazil, with team doctor Lídio Toledo telling the commission &quot;imagine if I stopped Ronaldo playing and Brazil lost. At that moment I&#x27;d have to go and live on the North Pole.&quot; Adrian Williams, professor of clinical neurology at Birmingham University, said that Ronaldo should not have played, that he would have been feeling the after effects of the seizure, and &quot;there is no way that he would have been able to perform to the best of his ability within 24 hours of his first fit – if it was his first fit.&quot; Despite his sub-par performance in the final due to his seizure hours earlier, Ronaldo was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament for his performances leading up to the final, and finished the tournament as the joint-third highest scorer. The nature of the incident set off a trail of questions and allegations which persisted for years, with Alex Bellos writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;,

A conspiracy surrounded Nike, the sportswear company who sponsored Ronaldo and the Brazilian national team, with some in Brazil believing the company had forced Ronaldo to play. The parliamentary inquiry was unable to find any wider conspiracy, although the Brazilian public remained unconvinced. Reporting for CNN, Don Riddell wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the great mysteries of our time: not the Loch Ness Monster, Stonehenge or the Lost City of Atlantis; it&#x27;s the case of the missing striker – not so much a whodunit, more a kind of a what the heck happened?&quot;

===2002 FIFA World Cup===

Prior to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo had barely played since rupturing the cruciate ligament in his right knee in April 2000, and he missed Brazil&#x27;s entire qualification campaign where, in his absence, the team had been poor.
Tim Vickery writes, &quot;Without Ronaldo, Brazil were a shambles, fortunate even to get to the tournament. With him, it was a different story.&quot; In a remarkable comeback from injury that had threatened his career, Ronaldo led Brazil to their record fifth World Cup title, receiving the Golden Boot as top scorer with eight goals. Many publications regarded his personal triumph as &quot;redemption&quot; for what occurred at the previous World Cup. Ronaldo spoke about his obsession with lifting the World Cup trophy, having missed out in 1998. &quot;I used to visualise the trophy in front of my eyes and imagine what a wonderful feeling it must be to hold it up in the air. It was a fabulous feeling actually to hold it in my hands and kiss it.&quot; Dubbed the &quot;three R&#x27;s&quot;, Ronaldo starred in a formidable attack alongside Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, and the trio were named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team.

Ronaldo scored against every opponent in the tournament except in the quarter-finals against England. The match-winner against Turkey in the semi-final, with the winning goal a toe-poke finish with little back-lift while on the run – a finish he learned while playing futsal in his youth – the final whistle saw fans behind the goal hoist huge white letters to spell out his name, akin to the Hollywood Sign. Much attention was on his haircut – in which his head was shaved except the forelock – done as a deliberate distraction to shift media attention away from a leg injury. He revealed that &quot;when I arrived in training with this haircut everybody stopped talking about the injury&quot;. In the final against Germany in Yokohama, Japan, Ronaldo scored twice in Brazil&#x27;s 2–0 win and tied Pelé&#x27;s Brazilian record of 12 career World Cup goals. Ronaldo was the first player to seek out German players to offer his condolences, before he was congratulated by Pelé when receiving his World Cup winners medal. Gérard Saillant, the French surgeon who operated on Ronaldo&#x27;s knee, was in the crowd as his guest, and stated after the game; &quot;This gives hope to everyone who is injured, even those who aren&#x27;t sportsmen, to see that by fighting you can make it. He&#x27;s back to where he was; it&#x27;s hugely satisfying and I am very moved.&quot;

Ronaldo received a number of accolades for his achievement, including the Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year and the BBC World Sport Star of the Year, and in December 2002 he dedicated his third FIFA World Player of the Year award to the medical team which helped him recover. In a 2017 interview with Fox Sports, Ronaldo stated, &quot;the best team I played in was the Brazilian one in 2002, we felt that we could always score. It was a team without any vanity, or individuals. The collective was important.&quot;

===2006 FIFA World Cup===
On 2 June 2004, Ronaldo scored an unusual hat-trick of penalties for Brazil against arch-rivals Argentina in a 2006 World Cup qualifying match, which put them top of the group. With 10 goals in 15 games, including a goal against Venezuela in the last game to secure first place, Ronaldo was the South American top scorer in Brazil&#x27;s qualifying campaign. Prior to the tournament, questions were asked of his weight and fitness, but was declared fit for Brazil&#x27;s opening match with Croatia.

At the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo was part of a much-publicized &quot;magic quartet&quot; alongside Adriano, Ronaldinho and Kaká. The all-star Brazilian team was promoted as masters of Joga Bonito, &quot;the beautiful game&quot;, which was advertised by Nike before the tournament. Although Brazil won their first two group games against Croatia and Australia, Ronaldo was repeatedly jeered for being overweight and slow, but coach Carlos Alberto Parreira kept him in the starting lineup.

With two goals against Japan in the third match, Ronaldo became the 20th player to score in three World Cups and also equalled the all-time World Cup finals scoring record of fourteen, held by Gerd Müller (Ronaldo scored at France 98, Korea/Japan 2002 and Germany 2006). He then broke Müller&#x27;s record in the Round of 16 match against Ghana by scoring his fifteenth-career World Cup goal. With his third goal of the tournament, Ronaldo became only the second player ever, after Jürgen Klinsmann, to score at least three goals in each of three World Cups. Brazil, however, were knocked out by France 1–0 with a goal by striker Thierry Henry in the quarter-finals. Ronaldo was awarded the Bronze Shoe as the third-highest goal-scorer of the World Cup.

Having been listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, Ronaldo stated, &quot;I am proud of my career and of the records I set. But I know that one day they will be broken.&quot; Ronaldo and Klinsmann&#x27;s shared record of at least three goals in three separate World Cup finals was broken by German striker Miroslav Klose, who has a record of at least four goals in each of three tournaments, having netted five at both the 2002 and 2006 finals, and four at the 2010 tournament. Ronaldo finished with fifteen goals in nineteen World Cup matches, for an average of 0.79 per game. His teammate Kaká reflected, &quot;Ronaldo is the best player I have ever played with. I have seen il Fenomeno do things nobody else has ever done.&quot;

===Farewell match and sporadic appearances===
In February 2011, it was announced that Ronaldo would be given one last match for Brazil, a friendly against Romania in São Paulo on 7 June 2011, five years after his last match with the national team. Brazilian Football Confederation official Ricardo Teixeira stated that it was fitting that his final game should take place in Brazil while representing his nation.

Ronaldo played for 15 minutes in a match that ended with a Brazilian victory with a goal from Fred. Fred celebrated his goal with Ronaldo&#x27;s famous &#x27;finger wag&#x27; celebration along with his Brazilian teammates. Ronaldo was introduced after 30 minutes, partnering 19-year-old Neymar in attack, and had three shots on target which were saved by the Romanian goalkeeper Ciprian Tătărușanu. After the first half ended, Ronaldo made a farewell speech to the crowd. With 62 goals for Brazil Ronaldo retired from international football as the second-highest goalscorer for his country, behind only Pelé (Neymar has since surpassed Pelé, with Ronaldo the third-highest scorer as of September 2023).

On 13 December 2011 Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane played a charity match with their friends against former and current players of the German team Hamburg in the ninth edition of the Match Against Poverty series, which Ronaldo and Zidane established in 2003. In December 2012, Ronaldo and Zidane reunited for the Match Against Poverty in Porto Alegre, Portugal, with the field littered with World Cup winners from France and Brazil, which also saw 1982 World Cup star Zico (Ronaldo&#x27;s childhood idol) turn out for Ronaldo&#x27;s team. In January 2013, Ronaldo was named one of the six ambassadors of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

Ronaldo was chosen as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2000 as he had the highest global appeal among sportspeople, and he accepted the role as he saw it as &quot;an obligation&quot; to help with causes around the world. Ronaldo played in the UNDP&#x27;s 11th Match Against Poverty on 4 March 2014 against a Zidane XI in Bern, Switzerland, with proceeds raised helping the recovery efforts in the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. Joined by Didier Drogba in attack, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in the next year&#x27;s match on 21 April 2015 in St Etienne, France, with proceeds going towards the African countries most affected by the Ebola epidemic.

On 14 June 2018, Ronaldo featured at the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia. He walked out with a child wearing a Russia 2018 shirt at the beginning, and returned at the end of the ceremony with the official ball of the 2018 World Cup – Adidas Telstar 18 – which was sent into space with the International Space Station crew in March and came back to Earth in early June.

==Style of play and legacy==
Ronaldo is regarded as one of the greatest and most complete forwards of all time. Nicknamed &quot;Il (or O) Fenomeno&quot; (the phenomenon), he was a prolific goalscorer, and despite being more of an individualistic attacker, he was also capable of providing assists for his teammates, due to his vision, passing and crossing ability. He was an extremely powerful, fast, and technical player, with excellent movement, as well as being a composed finisher. Highly regarded for his technical ability, Ronaldo was able to use both feet, despite being naturally right footed, and is considered one of the most skillful dribblers in the game. Ronaldo would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal, with Rob Smyth writing, &quot;he played like every attack had a 10-second deadline.. he would explode into life with no warning for defenders.&quot; He frequently beat several players when dribbling at speed, and excelled in one on one situations, due to his ball control, acceleration, agility, balance and nimble footwork in his prime.

His coach at Barcelona, Bobby Robson, commented: &quot;Ronaldo could start from the halfway line and the whole stadium would ignite. He was the fastest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen running with the ball. Had he managed to stay free of injury, he had every chance of becoming the best footballer ever.&quot; In one on one situations, Ronaldo often used elaborate feints to trick and beat defenders and goalkeepers; he popularised the use of many football tricks such as the elastico and the step over. Sid Lowe of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote, &quot;When he was one on one with the goalkeeper, you knew that he would score. He was so natural, so cool, so utterly in control. He would dip the shoulder, step over, and bang!&quot;

His Barcelona teammate Óscar García observed, &quot;I&#x27;d never seen anyone play football with such technical ability, creativity and precision at that incredible speed. What stood out to all of us, from the moment we met Ronnie, was that he could do things which other players found very difficult and make them look easy. But he could also produce those things while running at an unbelievable, explosive pace.&quot; With his combination of speed, skill and finishing Ronaldinho called Ronaldo &quot;the most complete striker there has ever been&quot;, a view echoed by Zlatan Ibrahimović, who stated, &quot;as a football player, he was complete. There will never, in my view, be a better player than him.&quot; The goalscoring idol of Lionel Messi, the Argentine states &quot;Ronaldo was the best striker I&#x27;ve ever seen. He was so fast he could score from nothing.&quot; Wanting to emulate Ronaldo growing up, Egypt and Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah opined, &quot;The ability, the speed, the intelligence, he had everything&quot;. Naming Ronaldo as an inspiration, Wayne Rooney stated, &quot;as an out-and-out forward he was probably the best.&quot; The outstanding influence for a generation of strikers, from Karim Benzema to Sergio Agüero, with Romelu Lukaku stating &quot;he changed the dimension of a striker&quot; and could &quot;dribble like a winger, run like a sprinter&quot;, Zlatan added, &quot;nobody influenced football and the players who emerged as much as Ronaldo&quot;.

Emilio Butragueño stated, &quot;Ronaldo creates a goalscoring opportunity where it doesn&#x27;t exist. Most strikers need the midfielders and their teammates, but he does not.&quot; On his speed of thought, Kaká said &quot;For me the best players are those who are able to think of a play and execute it quickest and in the best way possible, and Ronaldo was the best at that. The speed of thought he had – and the speed he had to carry out his actions – were perfect.&quot; Ronaldo was also a strong and powerful player who could shield the ball from the opposition, with former Italian defender Alessandro Nesta (who faced Ronaldo in a high-profile one on one duel in the 1998 UEFA Cup final which was billed as &quot;the best attacker against the best defender in Serie A&quot;) stating: &quot;It was the worst experience of my career. Ronaldo is the hardest attacker I&#x27;ve ever had to face.&quot; Asked who was the toughest opponent of his career, Fabio Cannavaro responded, &quot;I have no doubt, Ronaldo, the phenomenon. For my generation he was what Maradona or Pelé were for the previous ones. He was unmarkable.&quot; Sid Lowe compared Ronaldo&#x27;s ability to take on a number of opponents on a single run to what rugby player Jonah Lomu was doing in the same era. Regarding Ronaldo&#x27;s influence on the evolution of the centre-forward role, French former forward Thierry Henry said: &quot;He did things nobody had seen before. He, together with Romário and George Weah, reinvented the centre-forward position. They were the first to drop from the box to pick up the ball in midfield, switch to the flanks, attract and disorientate the central defenders with their runs, their accelerations, their dribbling.&quot;

Comparing his natural ability to Roger Federer, Paul MacDonald of &quot;Goal&quot; wrote, &quot;there&#x27;s a joy to be had watching something we know to be extremely difficult executed with considerable ease. Ronaldo in his prime was able to do that better than anyone who has ever played the game.&quot; A reliance on his superior innate ability is given as a reason for his application in training often not being as high as his teammates – though his knee issues may also have been a factor – with his Brazil teammate Emerson stating &quot;Ronaldo felt he didn&#x27;t need to work as hard as us, that he could do in two days what the rest of us would take ten days to do. And usually, he was right&quot;. On his precocious talent – a talent which saw him become the youngest FIFA World Player of the Year at age 20, and youngest Ballon d&#x27;Or recipient aged 21 – Rob Smyth of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote in 2016, &quot;Ronaldo is easily the best of the past 30 years, possibly ever. The other Ronaldo and Messi were brilliant teenagers but had nothing like the same impact at that age. Only Pelé, Diego Maradona and George Best can really compare.&quot; Asked to name the best player of his lifetime, José Mourinho said, &quot;Ronaldo, El Fenomeno. Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi have had longer careers. They have remained at the top every day for 15 years. However, if we are talking strictly about talent and skill, nobody surpasses Ronaldo.&quot; Mikaël Silvestre states, &quot;I played against [Lionel] Messi and I played with Cristiano at Manchester United, but he [Ronaldo] is something else in terms of speed. Cristiano, maybe you can guess that he has three or four tricks he would use most of the time, but Ronaldo, it was always something different. He was inventing things on the spot, so you can&#x27;t guide him left or right because he&#x27;s going to get out of these situations, no matter what&quot;. In 2020, Ronaldo was named in the Ballon d&#x27;Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI published by &quot;France Football&quot; magazine.

At his physical peak in the 1990s, Ronaldo became severely affected by the knee injuries he suffered from late 1999 onward and the subsequent weight gain during his inactivity, which limited his speed, fitness, and mobility. According to his physiotherapist Nilton Petrone, Ronaldo was vulnerable to injury due to a medical condition combined with his explosive running. &quot;Ronaldo had a problem called trochlear dysplasia. This makes the relationship between the kneecap and the femur a bit unstable. There is no direct surgery for that so the kneecap keeps, for a lack of a better word, &quot;dancing&quot; on the femur. Ronaldo&#x27;s injuries weren&#x27;t because his body was weak, but because of his explosive capacity. He didn&#x27;t just run fast in a straight line, he also changed direction at incredible speed. Ronaldo moved from left to right very fast...so it was obvious, by the way that he played, that injuries were always a possibility&quot;. Acknowledging &quot;he was never quite the same&quot; after his knee injury in 2000, with &quot;his pace and sheer brute force diminished in comparison to The Phenomenon&quot; in the 1990s, &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine ranked him the best player at the 2002 World Cup, adding &quot;he was still a cut above the rest&quot; in the tournament.

==Club ownership==
===Real Valladolid===
In September 2018, Ronaldo became the majority owner of La Liga club Real Valladolid after buying a 51% controlling stake in the club for €30 million. At his unveiling as the club&#x27;s new owner at Valladolid city hall, Ronaldo stated, &quot;I have gone through many stages in my training in football to prepare for this. Football is all about passion. We want to build the best team possible to compete while also giving information about our management with transparency.&quot;

===Cruzeiro===
In December 2021, Ronaldo bought a controlling stake in his boyhood club Cruzeiro. Investing 400 million reais ($70 million) in the club, Ronaldo stated he wants to &quot;give back to Cruzeiro and take them where they deserve to be.&quot;

On 30 April 2024, an announcement was made that Ronaldo had agreed to sell his ownership stake for undisclosed terms to BPW Sports company. The announcement also noted that Ronaldo would continue to be on the club&#x27;s board of directors.

==Outside football==
===Personal life===
In 1997, Ronaldo met the Brazilian model and actress Susana Werner on the set of the Brazilian telenovela &quot;Malhação&quot; when they acted together in three episodes. Although they never married, they began a long-term relationship and lived together in Milan until the beginning of 1999.

In December 1999, Ronaldo married Brazilian footballer Milene Domingues, at the time pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first son, Ronald, who was born in Milan, on 6 April 2000. The marriage lasted four years. In 2005, Ronaldo became engaged to Brazilian model and MTV VJ Daniella Cicarelli, who became pregnant but suffered a miscarriage; the relationship lasted only three months after their luxurious wedding at the Château de Chantilly. The ceremony reportedly cost £700,000 (€896,000).

Despite his fame – a 2003 poll by Nike listed him the world&#x27;s most famous sportsperson (and third most famous person overall) – Ronaldo is protective of his privacy, including with teammates, stating in an interview with &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, &quot;each [player] has his own private life, and no one thinks about anyone else&#x27;s private life. Or talks about it.&quot; By 2003 he was fluent in Portuguese, Spanish and Italian, and had a good understanding of English.

In a 2005 interview with &quot;Folha de S.Paulo&quot;, Ronaldo revealed that, somewhat unexpectedly, he identified racially as white, generating a wider conversation about the complex role of race in Brazil. Ronaldo&#x27;s father, Nelio Nazario, stated, &quot;He knows full well that he&#x27;s black. Actually, at the time, I thought it was some philosophy, something to that effect. Because he knows he&#x27;s black.&quot; According to a study led by geneticist Sérgio Pena of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, most Brazilians often have a misconception about their roots. &quot;The maternal ancestry of the Brazilian white was one-third African, one third Amerindian, and one third European. An individual who considers himself white may be genomically more African than an individual who considers himself to be brown or black.&quot;

In April 2008, Ronaldo was involved in a scandal involving three travesti prostitutes whom he met in a nightclub in Rio de Janeiro. Ronaldo claimed that upon discovering that they were legally male, he offered them $600 to leave. One of the three attempted to blackmail Ronaldo, while the other two admitted to lying about having sex with him. Ronaldo&#x27;s engagement to Maria Beatriz Antony was immediately halted, but resumed shortly after and they married in the same year. Maria Beatriz Antony gave birth to their first daughter, named Maria Sophia, in Rio de Janeiro, on 24 December 2008. In April 2009, the family moved to a new penthouse in São Paulo. On 6 April 2010, Maria Beatriz Antony gave birth to their second daughter. The girl, born in São Paulo, was named Maria Alice, and was born exactly 10 years after her older brother Ronald.

In December 2010, Ronaldo and his family moved to a new mansion in São Paulo. Also in December, Ronaldo took a paternity test and was confirmed to be the father of a boy named Alexander, born in April 2005. The boy was born after a brief relationship between Ronaldo and Michele Umezu, a Brazilian waitress who Ronaldo first met in Tokyo in 2002. After the confirmation of his fourth child, Ronaldo stated on 6 December 2010 that he had had a vasectomy, feeling that having four children was enough. Ronaldo and Maria Beatriz Antony divorced in 2012.

In a 2011 interview with the BBC, former Real Madrid teammate Steve McManaman spoke about Ronaldo&#x27;s personality. &quot;He could go in a restaurant, and I could go in with him, and you&#x27;re not just there with close friends. He invites everybody. You&#x27;d be at a table with him and it&#x27;d be a judge sitting opposite talking to a politician with someone off the street listening in. So he just had this amazing aura, where everyone wanted to join him. Sometimes there&#x27;d be 20 to 30 people sitting at meal times with him. He was a wonderful person. Everybody would second that, no matter what club he played for.&quot;
Ronaldo was the co-owner of A1 Team Brazil, along with former F1 driver Emerson Fittipaldi. Ronaldo co-owns the sports marketing company 9INE, with his friend, mixed martial artist Anderson Silva, one of his clients. A keen poker player, in April 2013 Ronaldo became a member of PokerStars SportStar, and in 2014 he played a charity poker tournament against tennis star Rafael Nadal. On 11 December 2014, Ronaldo became a minority owner of the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League. In 2015, Ronaldo opened eight new branches of his youth football school – the Ronaldo Academy – in China, the U.S. and Brazil, with 100 expected to be opened worldwide by 2020. In 2017, Ronaldo&#x27;s son, Ronald, was selected for the junior football team representing Brazil in the 2017 Maccabiah Games. The Maccabiah is described as &quot;the Jewish Olympics&quot;; Ronald is not Jewish, but some participating countries have more relaxed rules about eligibility and Ronald is a member of a Jewish football club.

In January 2023, Ronaldo announced his fifth engagement, to model and businesswoman Celina Locks. Ronaldo and Locks went on to marry in July of the same year.

==== Religion ====
A practicing Catholic, Ronaldo was baptized into the faith in 2023. He donated a signed football to Pope Francis in 2014, which is now housed in the Vatican Museums.

===Media===
Ronaldo appeared in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season 18 episode &quot;Marge Gamer&quot; broadcast in April 2007. Simon Crerar of &quot;The Times&quot; listed Ronaldo&#x27;s performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show. Ronaldo made a cameo appearance in &quot;Mike Bassett: England Manager&quot; (2001) and each film of the &quot;Goal!&quot; film trilogy, &quot;Goal!&quot; (2005), &quot;Goal II: Living the Dream&quot; (2007) and &quot;Goal III: Taking on the World&quot; (2009). Archive footage of Ronaldo features in the music video &quot;We Are One (Ole Ola)&quot;, the official song of the 2014 World Cup by Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez.

Ronaldo has appeared in various commercials, from Snickers chocolate bar to Pirelli tyres. Ronaldo&#x27;s usual goal celebration of both arms outstretched – especially from his early career – was the basis for Pirelli&#x27;s 1998 commercial where he replaced the figure of Christ from the &quot;Christ the Redeemer&quot; statue that towers over his home city of Rio de Janeiro while in an Inter Milan strip. It was controversial with the Catholic Church. Released in 2000 for the PlayStation and Game Boy Color, the video game &quot;Ronaldo V-Football&quot; was exclusively endorsed by Ronaldo. In 2017 Ronaldo was added as an icon to the Ultimate Team in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game &quot;FIFA 18&quot;, receiving a 95 rating along with Brazilian compatriot Pelé, Argentine playmaker Diego Maradona, former Russian goalkeeper Lev Yashin and former French star Thierry Henry. Ronaldo also appears as the cover athlete on the Icon edition of the game.

In May 2021, DAZN released the first of a six-part series titled &quot;Ronaldo: El Presidente&quot;. The series takes viewers inside the day-to-day running of Real Valladolid, revealing every challenge and triumph in Valladolid&#x27;s first full season under their Brazilian president, intercut with parallel narratives detailing the highs and lows of Ronaldo&#x27;s own playing career.

===Nike sponsorship===

Ronaldo has been sponsored by sportswear company Nike since the early part of his career. In 1996, Nike signed Ronaldo to a 10-year contract and to a lifetime endorsement deal worth over $180 million. Nicknamed R9 (his initial and shirt number), Ronaldo is closely associated with the original Nike Mercurial R9 that was designed for him for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. To celebrate 15 years of the boot, Nike created a Mercurial Vapor IX inspired by the 1998 design, with Phil McCartney, VP of Football Footwear for Nike, stating; &quot;Ronaldo&#x27;s impact on the game 15 years ago was immense, and in the run up to 2014, we wanted to celebrate that boot and the man himself. We thought a modern construction of his 1998 boot would be a great commemoration of that moment.&quot; 
In 2018, Ronaldo&#x27;s R9 Mercurial boots inspired the Nike Mercurial Superfly VI boots commissioned for Kylian Mbappé. Unveiled in 2000, a bronze statue of Ronaldo is located next to Ronaldo Field at Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon.

Ronaldo has appeared in a series of Nike commercials. He starred in the 1996 Nike commercial titled &quot;Good vs Evil&quot; in a gladiatorial game set in a Roman amphitheatre. Appearing alongside football players from around the world, including Paolo Maldini, Eric Cantona, Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert and Jorge Campos, they defend &quot;the beautiful game&quot; against a team of demonic warriors, destroying evil by winning the match. In 1998, he featured in a Nike commercial set in an airport with a number of stars from the Brazil national team, including Romário and Roberto Carlos. In the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in Nike&#x27;s &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded &quot;Scopion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Fabio Cannavaro, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona as the tournament &quot;referee&quot;. In the run-up to the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo starred as a mentor in Nike&#x27;s Risk Everything animated commercial with a host of current players in the Nike stable.

<text>A university constituency is a constituency, used in elections to a legislature, that represents the members of one or more universities rather than residents of a geographical area. These may or may not involve plural voting, in which voters are eligible to vote in or as part of this entity and their home area&#x27;s geographical constituency.

When James VI inherited the English throne in 1603, the system was adopted by the Parliament of England. The system was continued in the Parliament of Great Britain (from 1707 to 1800) and the United Kingdom Parliament, until 1950. It was also used in the Parliament of Ireland, in the Kingdom of Ireland, from 1613 to 1800, and in the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1936.

Such constituencies have also existed in Japan and in some countries of the British Empire such as India.

At present there are four instances in two countries of university constituencies: two in Seanad Éireann (the upper—and in general less powerful—house of the legislature of the Republic of Ireland) and two in the Senate of Rwanda.

==Summary==
As shown, at Westminster (in the English then successor British parliaments) 4 seats were incepted in 1603 and the final total, 12, were abolished in 1950.

The Northern Irish body was the last in the UK to abolish such seats: it abolished its four for Queens, Belfast in 1969.

Six such seats continue in Seanad Éireann, the upper chamber of the Oireachtas (legislature of the Republic of Ireland). They are the sole directly elected members of the Seanad, with the remainder of the seats being elected by a combination of members of Oireachtas, incoming TDs and outgoing Senators, and local councillors, along with 11 members appointed by the Taoiseach.

==United Kingdom==

King James VI of Scotland, on ascending the English throne, brought to the English Parliament a practice which endured in the Scottish Parliament of allowing the universities to elect members. The king believed that the universities were often affected by the decisions of Parliament, and ought therefore to have representation in it. James gave the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford two seats each from 1603. On the formal Union (1707), Scottish universities lost their representatives as none were appointed to the Parliament of Great Britain (at Westminster). The voters were the graduates of the university, whether they were resident or not; they could vote for the university seats in addition to any other vote that they might have.

After the Act of Union 1800 with Ireland, the University of Dublin (Trinity College), which had elected two MPs to the Parliament of Ireland since 1613, was allowed one member from 1801 and two from 1832.

In 1868, three new one-member seats were created: University of London; Glasgow and Aberdeen universities combined; and St Andrews and Edinburgh universities combined.

In 1918, the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast and the National University of Ireland each received seats. Both these, as well as the University of Dublin, also received four seats in the devolved Stormont parliament and the Southern Ireland parliament respectively that were established in 1920 and first used in elections in 1921. Also in 1918, the Scottish universities switched to all electing three members jointly (see Combined Scottish Universities).

In 1918, all the other English universities (i.e. except for Cambridge, Oxford and London) were enfranchised as a single constituency with two seats, as Combined English Universities. They were Birmingham, Bristol, Durham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, and Sheffield. Reading was added in August 1928. The University of Wales also received one seat in 1918.

1918 also saw the introduction of the Single Transferable Vote for university constituencies.

===Abolition===
The Labour government in 1930 attempted to abolish the university constituencies but was defeated in the House of Commons. Although the members for the university constituencies were usually Conservatives, in the later years independent candidates began to win many of the seats. The Labour government finally abolished the university constituencies via the Representation of the People Act 1948, with effect from the dissolution of Parliament in 1950, along with all other examples of plural voting.

The Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast constituency survived in the Parliament of Northern Ireland until it was abolished in 1968 (with effect from the dissolution of Parliament in 1969) by the Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 (c. 20 (N.I.)). This was one of several measures by the then Northern Ireland Prime Minister Terence O&#x27;Neill to reform elements of the election franchise and deal with many long-standing civil rights grievances.

===Notable members===
The members for the university constituencies include many notable statesmen: William Pitt the Younger and Lord Palmerston both served as MPs for Cambridge University, and Robert Peel and William Ewart Gladstone each served as MP for Oxford University for portions of their careers. In his last years Ramsay MacDonald was MP for Combined Scottish Universities after losing his previous seat in the 1935 general election. Many criticised this, as he had previously sought to abolish the seats whilst Labour prime minister and many now felt the seats were being used to provide a failed politician with a seat he could not find elsewhere.

The humorist and law reform activist A. P. Herbert sat as an independent member for Oxford University from 1935 to 1950. He described the counting of the votes at the 1935 election in a chapter entitled &quot;&#x27;P.R.&#x27;: Or, Standing for Oxford&quot; in his 1936 book &quot;Mild and Bitter&quot;.

=== List of members ===
Only members after 1885 are shown.

==Ireland==
 There are two university constituencies in Seanad Éireann, with graduates of the Dublin University and National University of Ireland entitled to elect three Senators each. Only graduates who are Irish citizens are entitled to vote in these elections. There is no residency requirement so those qualifying who are resident outside the State may vote. Elections are conducted under the single transferable vote and by postal ballot.

When the Irish Free State seceded from the UK in 1922, its new lower house of parliament, the Free State Dáil, had three seats each for the two university constituencies. However, under the Electoral Act 1923 voters registered in a university constituency were not permitted to also vote in a geographical one. Both university constituencies were ultimately abolished by the Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Act 1936 and the Electoral (University Constituencies) Act 1936, which took effect on the dissolution of the Dáil in 1937. These two constituencies were recreated in Seanad Éireann under the Constitution of Ireland adopted in 1937, with the first Seanad election in 1938.

Some politicians have called for university representation to be abolished, on the ground that it is unacceptable that possession of a degree should confer greater electoral rights than those available to other voters. An example of this view can be found in the Green Party submission on Seanad reform in 2004.

==Other countries==
*Australia: the electoral district of University of Sydney returned one member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly between 1876 and 1880. It was abolished one year after the second member elected, Edmund Barton, took his seat. Graduates of the University of Sydney wore academic gowns while voting.
*India: India had university constituencies before independence, but these were abolished with the adoption of the modern Constitution of India. Nevertheless, today the President of India has the authority to appoint not more than twelve scientists, artists, or other persons who have special knowledge in similar fields, to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house in the Parliament of India. Currently, the upper houses of the state legislatures in the six states that have them have graduates&#x27; constituencies, that elect one-twelfth of their members. Each graduates&#x27; constituency is defined geographically rather than by university; graduates of any approved Indian university may choose to register in the graduates&#x27; constituency of their place of residence instead of registering in the ordinary constituency.
*Rwanda: Two members of the Senate of Rwanda are elected by the staff of universities.
*Thirteen Colonies: The College of William &amp; Mary held a seat in the House of Burgesses of the Virginia Colony in 1693, and was supported by taxes on tobacco and furs. This seat was revoked after the House of Burgesses became the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia within the newly independent United States of America.
*Bavaria: From 1946 to 1999, the Bavarian upper house, the Bavarian Senate had reserved three seats to universities and colleges.

<text>Kent M. Pitman (KMP) is a programmer who has been involved for many years in the design, implementation, and use of systems based on the programming languages Lisp and Scheme. , he has been President of HyperMeta, Inc.

Pitman was chair of the ad hoc group (part of X3J13) that designed the Common Lisp Error and Condition System and is author of the proposal document that was ultimately adopted, and many papers on Lisp programming and computer programming in general.

While in high school, he saw output from one of the &quot;guess the animal&quot; pseudo-artificial intelligence (AI) games then popular. He considered implementing a version of the program in BASIC, but once at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), instead he implemented it in several dialects of Lisp, including Maclisp.

He was a technical contributor to X3J13, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) subcommittee that standardized Common Lisp and contributed to the design of the programming language. He prepared the document that became ANSI Common Lisp, the Common Lisp HyperSpec (a hypertext conversion of the standard), and the document that became International Organization for Standardization (ISO) ISLISP. He can often be found on the Usenet newsgroup codice_1, where he is involved in discussions about Lisp and computer programming, and insider perspectives on Lisp evolution and Common Lisp standardization. In some posts there, he has expressed his opinion on open-source software, including open source implementations of Lisp and Scheme, as something that should be judged individually on its essential merits, rather than automatically considered good merely by being free or open.

<text>Stephen Fuller Austin (November 3, 1793 – December 27, 1836) was an American-born empresario. Known as the &quot;Father of Texas&quot; and the founder of Anglo Texas, he led the second and, ultimately, the successful colonization of the region by bringing 300 families and their slaves from the United States to the Tejas region of Mexico in 1825.

Born in Virginia and raised in southeastern Missouri, Austin served in the Missouri territorial legislature. He moved to Arkansas Territory and later to Louisiana. His father, Moses Austin, received an empresario grant from Spain to settle Texas. After Moses Austin died in 1821, Stephen Austin won recognition of the empresario grant from the newly independent nation of Mexico.

Austin attracted numerous Anglo-American settlers to move to Texas, and by 1825, Austin had brought the first 300 American families into the territory. Throughout the 1820s, Austin sought to maintain good relations with the Mexican government and helped suppress the Fredonian Rebellion. He also helped ensure the introduction of slavery into Texas despite the Mexican government&#x27;s opposition to the institution. Austin led the initial actions against the indigenous Karankawa people in this area.

As Texas settlers became increasingly dissatisfied with the Mexican government, Austin advocated conciliation, but the dissent against Mexico escalated into the Texas Revolution. Austin led Texas forces at the successful Siege of Béxar before serving as a commissioner to the United States. Austin ran as a candidate in the 1836 Texas presidential election but was defeated by Sam Houston, who had served as a general in the war and entered the race two weeks before the election. Houston appointed Austin as Secretary of State for the new republic, and Austin held that position until his death in December 1836.

Numerous places and institutions are named in his honor, including the capital of Texas.

==Early years==

Stephen F. Austin was born on November 3, 1793, in the mining region of southwestern Virginia. His parents were Mary Brown Austin and Moses Austin. In 1798, his family moved west to the lead-mining region of present-day Potosi, Missouri. Moses Austin received a &quot;sitio&quot; from the Spanish government for the mining site of &quot;Mine à Breton&quot;, which had been established by French colonists.

His great-great-grandfather, Anthony Austin (b. 1636), was the son of Richard Austin (b.1598 in Bishopstoke, Hampshire, England). The immigrant ancestors, Richard Austin and his wife Esther, were original settlers of Suffield, Massachusetts, which became Connecticut in 1749.

When Austin was eleven years old, his family sent him back East to be educated, first at the preparatory school of Bacon Academy in Colchester, Connecticut. He studied at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, from which he graduated in 1810. After graduation, Austin began studying to be a lawyer, reading the law with an established firm.

At age 21, he was elected to and served in the Missouri Territory legislature. There, he was &quot;influential in obtaining a charter for the struggling Bank of St. Louis&quot;. Left penniless after the Panic of 1819, Austin decided to move south to the new Arkansas Territory.

He acquired property on the south bank of the Arkansas River, in the area that would later become Little Rock. After purchasing the property, he learned the area was being considered as the location for the new territorial capital, which could make his land worth a great deal more. He made his home in Hempstead County, Arkansas. Austin declared his candidacy for Congress two weeks before the first Arkansas territorial elections in 1820. His late entrance meant his name did not appear on the ballot in two of the five counties, but he still placed second in the field of six candidates. Later, he was appointed as a First Circuit Court judge. Little Rock was designated as the territorial capital over the next few months. But Austin&#x27;s claim to land in the area was contested, and the courts ruled against him. The Territorial Assembly reorganized the government and abolished Austin&#x27;s judgeship.

Austin left the territory and moved to Louisiana. He reached New Orleans in November 1820. He met and stayed with Joseph H. Hawkins, a New Orleans lawyer and former Kentucky congressman, and made arrangements to study law with him.

==Move to Texas==

During Austin&#x27;s time in Arkansas, his father traveled to Spanish Texas and received an empresarial grant that would allow him to bring 300 American families to Texas. Moses Austin caught pneumonia soon after returning to Missouri. He directed that his &quot;empresario&quot; grant would be taken over by his son Stephen. Although Austin was reluctant to carry on his father&#x27;s Texas venture, he was persuaded to do so by a letter from his mother, written two days before Moses&#x27;s death.

Austin boarded the steamer &quot;Beaver&quot; and departed to New Orleans to meet Spanish officials led by Erasmo Seguín. He was at Natchitoches, Louisiana, in 1821 when he learned of his father&#x27;s death. &quot;This news has effected me very much, he was one of the most feeling and affectionate Fathers that ever lived. His faults I now say, and always have, were not of the heart.&quot;

Austin led his party to travel in four weeks to San Antonio, with the intent of reauthorizing his father&#x27;s grant; they arrived on August 12. While in transit, they learned Mexico had declared its independence from Spain, and Texas had become a Mexican province rather than a Spanish territory. José Antonio Navarro, a San Antonio native with ambitious visions of the future of Texas, befriended Stephen F. Austin, and the two developed a lasting association. Navarro, proficient in Spanish and Mexican law, assisted Austin in obtaining his empresario contracts. In San Antonio, the grant was reauthorized by Governor Antonio María Martínez, who allowed Austin to explore the Gulf Coast between San Antonio and the Brazos River to find a suitable location for a colony. As guides for the party, Manuel Becerra and three Aranama Indians went with the expedition.

Austin advertised the Texas opportunity in New Orleans, announcing that land was available along the Brazos and Colorado rivers. A family of a husband, wife, and two children would receive at twelve and a half cents per acre. Farmers could get and ranchers . In December 1821, the first U.S. colonists crossed into the granted territory by land and sea on the Brazos River in present-day Brazoria County.

==Empresario==

Austin&#x27;s plan for an American colony was thrown into turmoil by Mexico&#x27;s gaining independence from Spain in 1821. Governor Martínez informed Austin that the &quot;junta instituyente&quot;, the new rump congress of the government of Agustín de Iturbide of Mexico, refused to recognize the land grant authorized by Spain. His government intended to use a general immigration law to regulate new settlement in Mexico. Austin traveled to Mexico City, where he persuaded the &quot;junta instituyente&quot; to approve the grant to his father and the law signed by the Mexican Emperor on January 3, 1823.

The old imperial law offered heads of families a league and a labor of land, , and other inducements. It also provided for the employment of agents, called &quot;empresarios&quot;, to promote immigration. As an &quot;empresario&quot;, Austin was to receive 67,000 acres of land for each 200 families he brought to Texas. According to the law, immigrants were not required to pay fees to the government. Some of the immigrants denied Austin&#x27;s right to charge them for services at the rate of 12.5 cents/acre (31 cents/ha).

When Emperor of Mexico Agustín de Iturbide abdicated in March 1823, the law was annulled once again. In April 1823, Austin induced the congress to grant him a contract to bring 300 families into Texas. He wanted honest, hard-working people who would make the colony a success. In 1824, the congress passed a new immigration law that allowed the individual states of Mexico to administer public lands and open them to settlement under certain conditions. In March 1825, the legislature of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas passed a law similar to the one authorized by Iturbide. The law continued the system of &quot;empresarios&quot; and granted each married man a league of land, , stipulating that he must pay the state $30 within six years.

Austin sought an area for his colonists on the land near the mouth of the Colorado River (Texas) for a colony that could provide a good supply of clean, potable water. Austin claimed rich tracts of land near bays and river mouths already populated by the Karankawa. The Karankawa relied on these bays for the fish and shellfish that provided their winter food sources and thus were fiercely protective of that land.

Austin was greeted by the native Karankawa inhabitants with the help of his Mexican scouts, they watched closely as the immigrants unloaded their goods, so that their two sloops could navigate safely up the shallows of the Colorado River. When the Karankawa noticed that only four armed men were guarding the merchandise of 300 immigrants, they made their attack, killing the guards and plundering the articles.

On February 23, 1823, the Karankawa killed two men, named Loy and John C. Alley, and wounded another named John C. Clark. They were bringing home a canoe full of corn on the Colorado River near the mouth of Skull Creek. Later the same evening, Robert Brotherton was riding along a trail near Skull Creek when he was &quot;met by the Indians, robbed of his guns and perceiving he was in danger of his life after making his escape, was wounded in the back with an arrow, very severely. A volunteer militia was organized and went to the scene of the robbery. They followed the tracks to a nearby encampment and slew nineteen of them, scalped them and plundered their camp&quot;, wrote one of the participants, John H. Moore. This event became known as the Skull Creek massacre.

Austin wrote that extermination of the Karankawa would be necessary, even though his first encounter with the tribe was friendly. He talked to the settlers of cannibalism and extreme violence of the Karankawa, sometimes more specifically the Carancaguases. Research had suggested that these accusations of cannibalism were false, possibly caused by confusion with another tribe, and that the Karankawa were horrified by cannibalism when they learned of it being practiced by shipwrecked Spaniards. Austin told the colonists that the Karankawa would be impossible to live among. Austin continued to encourage violence both against and between the Indian tribes, culminating in 1825 with his order for all Kawankawa to be pursued and killed on sight.

By late 1825, Austin had brought the first 300 families to his settlement, the Austin Colony; these 300 are now known in Texas history as the Old Three Hundred. Austin had obtained further contracts to settle an additional 900 families between 1825 and 1829. He had effective civil and military authority over the settlers, but he quickly introduced a semblance of American law – the Constitution of Coahuila y Tejas was agreed on in November 1827. Austin organized small, informal armed groups to protect the colonists, which evolved into the Texas Rangers. Despite his hopes, Austin was making little money from his endeavors; the colonists were unwilling to pay for his services as &quot;empresario,&quot; and most of his revenues were spent on the processes of government and other public services.

During these years, Austin, a Louisiana Lodge No. 111 member at Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, sought to establish Freemasonry in Texas. Freemasonry was well established among the educated classes of Mexican society. It had been introduced among the aristocracy loyal to the House of Bourbon, and the conservatives had total control over the Order. By 1827, Americans living in Mexico City had introduced the United States York Rite of Freemasonry as a liberal alternative to the established European-style Scottish Rite. On February 11, 1828, Austin called a meeting of Freemasons at San Felipe to elect officers and to petition the Masonic Grand Lodge in Mexico City for a charter to form a lodge. Austin was elected Worshipful Master of the new lodge. Although the petition reached Matamoros and was to be forwarded to Mexico City, nothing more was heard. By 1828, the ruling faction in Mexico feared the liberal elements in Texas might try to gain their independence. Fully aware of the political philosophies of American Freemasons, the Mexican government outlawed Freemasonry on October 25, 1828. In 1829, Austin called another meeting, where it was decided that it was &quot;impolitic and imprudent, at this time, to form Masonic lodges in Texas&quot;.

He was active in promoting trade and currying the good favor of the Mexican authorities, aiding them in the suppression of the Fredonian Rebellion of Haden Edwards. Some historians consider the Fredonian Rebellion the beginning of the Texas Revolution. Although &quot;premature ...  the Fredonian Rebellion sparked the powder for later success.&quot; For this event, Austin raised troops to fight with Mexican troops against the Texas rebels. With the colonists numbering more than 11,000 by 1832, they were becoming less amenable to Austin&#x27;s cautious leadership, and the Mexican government was becoming less cooperative. It was concerned with the colony&#x27;s growth and the U.S. government&#x27;s efforts to buy the state from them. The Mexican government had attempted to stop further U.S. immigration as early as April 1830, but Austin&#x27;s skills gained an exemption for his colonies. He granted land to immigrants based on to the husband, 320 to the wife, 160 for every child, and 80 for every enslaved person.

==Slavery==
Slavery was a very important issue to Austin, one he called &quot;of great interest&quot; to him. Austin was a periodical enslaver throughout his life; however, he had conflicting views about it. Theoretically, he believed slavery was wrong and went against the American ideal of liberty. In practice, however, he agreed with the social, economic, and political justifications for it and worked hard to defend and expand it. Despite his defense of it, he also harbored concerns that the long-term effects of slavery would destroy American society. He grew particularly concerned following Nat Turner&#x27;s rebellion in 1831, stating:

While Austin thought it would be advantageous someday for Texas to phase out of slavery, up until the Texas Revolution, he worked to ensure that his colony&#x27;s immigrants could bypass the Mexican government&#x27;s resistance to it. Doing so ensured the population growth and economic development of his colony, which was primarily dependent on the monocropping of cotton and sugar. In August 1825, he recommended that the state government allow immigrants to bring people they were enslaving with them through 1840, with the caveat that female grandchildren of the enslaved people would be freed by age 15 and males by age 25. His recommendation was rejected.

In 1826, when a state committee proposed abolishing slavery outright, 25 percent of the people in Austin&#x27;s colony were enslaved. Austin&#x27;s colonists, mostly pro-slavery immigrants from the south, threatened to leave Texas if the proposition passed, while prospective Southern immigrants hesitated to come to Texas until slavery was guaranteed there. Austin conceded that his colony&#x27;s success depended on slavery. Without enslaved people, the colonists would lack the mass labor to cultivate the land, which would stall the pace of immigration needed to develop and increase the land&#x27;s value, deflate the economy, and motivate his colonists to leave.

Austin went before the legislature and pleaded that, at the least, his original 300 families should be allowed to continue enslaving people. He argued against the &quot;bad faith&quot; of freeing them, demanded reparations to enslavers for every enslaved person emancipated by the state, warned that the loss of enslaved people could leave some colonists destitute, and reasoned that freeing them would not only leave his settlers alone in the harsh Texas environment but would also expose them to the discomfort and nuisance of living amongst formerly enslaved people, who would become vagrants seeking retribution upon their former owners. While he waited for the legislature&#x27;s verdict of his request, Austin went into a deep depression over the issue and sent his brother, Brown Austin, to further lobby the legislature on his behalf.

In March 1827, the legislature signed Article 13 into law. Despite the law complying with some of his requests, Austin called it &quot;unconstitutional&quot;. He contested the law as it freed the children of enslaved people at birth, established a six-month grace period before fully emancipating all enslaved people in the state, and included provisions to improve the conditions of enslaved people and transitioning freedmen. Austin –– who had been so effective in persuading the legislature, however, that the author of Article 13 (before its passage) requested to withdraw it –– helped his colonists evade the law by advising them to legally supplant the word &quot;slave&quot; with the words &quot;workingmen&quot;, &quot;family servants&quot;, and &quot;laborers&quot;, and by working to pass a decree that banned freedmen from Texas and forced emancipated slaves to work for their former slaveowners until the accrued &quot;debt&quot; (e.g. clothing, food), incurred for their own enslavement, was worked off.

In 1828, Austin petitioned the legislature to guarantee that slaveowners immigrating to Texas could legally &quot;free&quot; their slaves before immigrating and contract them into a lifetime term of indentured servitude, thereby avoiding recognizing them as slaves. He lobbied to help his colony elude president Vicente Guerrero&#x27;s 1829 decree to emancipate enslaved people in the province legally and to bypass the government&#x27;s effort to prohibit slavery when it passed the Law of April 6, 1830.

In 1829, John Durst, a prominent landowner and politician, wrote about the president&#x27;s emancipation of enslaved people, &quot;We are ruined forever should this measure be adopted&quot;. Stephen F. Austin replied,

In 1830, Austin wrote that he would oppose Texas joining the United States without guarantees that he should &quot;insist on the perpetual exclusion of slavery from this state [Texas]&quot;. In 1833, he wrote:

In May 1835, Austin&#x27;s colonists learned that Mexico&#x27;s tolerance for the evasions of enslavers was drawing to a close with its proposal of new abolition legislation. Alarmed, and with Austin imprisoned in Mexico for pushing for independence, colonists turned against the Mexican government, calling it &quot;oppressive&quot; and a &quot;plundering, robbing, autocratical government&quot; without regard for the security of &quot;life, liberty or property&quot;. Resisting the impact a changed slavery policy would have on economic growth, and fearing rumors of Mexico&#x27;s plan to free the enslaved people and turn them loose upon the colonists, shortly after Austin returned from Mexico, he and his colonists took up arms against the Mexican government. Austin later gained U.S. Government support for his revolution when he wrote to Senator Lewis F. Linn and pleaded that Santa Anna planned to &quot;exterminate&quot; all of the colonists and fill Texas &quot;with Indians and negroes [freed slaves]&quot;.

==Relations with Mexico==

Immigration controls and the introduction of tariff laws had done much to dissatisfy the colonists, peaking in the Anahuac Disturbances. Austin became involved in Mexican politics, supporting the upstart Antonio López de Santa Anna. Following the success of Santa Anna, the colonists sought a compensatory reward, proclaimed at the Convention of 1832: resumption of immigration, tariff exemption, separation from Coahuila, and a new state government for Texas. Austin did not support these demands; he considered them ill-timed and tried to moderate them. When they were repeated and extended at the Convention of 1833, Austin traveled to Mexico City on July 18, 1833, and met with Vice President Valentín Gómez Farías. Austin did gain certain significant reforms: the immigration ban was lifted, but a separate state government was not authorized. Statehood in Mexico required a population of 80,000, and Texas had only 30,000.

Believing that he was pushing for Texas independence and suspecting that he was trying to incite insurrection, the Mexican government arrested Austin in January 1834 in Saltillo. He was taken to Mexico City and imprisoned. No charges were filed against him as no court would accept jurisdiction. He was moved from prison to prison. He was released under bond in December 1834 and required to stay in the Federal District. He was entirely freed under the general amnesty in July 1835 and, in August 1835, left Mexico to return to Texas via New Orleans.

==Texas Revolution==

In his absence, several events propelled the colonists toward confrontation with Santa Anna&#x27;s centralist government. Austin temporarily commanded the Texian forces during the Siege of Béxar from October 12 to December 11, 1835. After learning of the Disturbances at Anahuac and Velasco in the summer of 1835, an enraged Santa Anna made rapid preparations for the Mexican army to sweep Anglo settlers from Texas. War began in October 1835 at Gonzales. The Republic of Texas, created by a new constitution on March 2, 1836, won independence following a string of defeats with the dramatic turnabout victory at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, and the capture of Santa Anna the following morning. He was then imprisoned.

==Republic of Texas==

In December 1835, Austin, Branch Archer, and William H. Wharton were appointed commissioners to the U.S. by the provisional government of the republic. On June 10, 1836, Austin was in New Orleans, where he received word of Santa Anna&#x27;s defeat by Sam Houston at the Battle of San Jacinto. Austin returned to Texas to rest at Peach Point in August. On August 4, he announced his candidacy for president of Texas. Austin felt confident he could win the election until two weeks before the election, when on August 20, Houston entered the race. Austin wrote, &quot;Many of the old settlers who are too blind to see or understand their interest will vote for him.&quot; Houston carried East Texas, the Red River region, and most of the soldiers&#x27; votes. Austin received 587 votes to Sam Houston&#x27;s 5,119 and Henry Smith&#x27;s 743 votes. Houston appointed Austin as the first secretary of state of the new republic; however, Austin only served approximately two months before his death.

==Death and estate==
In December 1836, Austin was in the new capital of Columbia (now known as West Columbia), where he caught a severe cold; his condition worsened. Doctors were called in but could not help him. Austin died of pneumonia at noon on December 27, 1836. He was at the home of George B. McKinstry, near what is now West Columbia, Texas. He was 43. Austin&#x27;s last words were, &quot;The independence of Texas is recognized! Don&#x27;t you see it in the papers?...&quot; Upon hearing of Austin&#x27;s death, Houston ordered an official statement proclaiming: &quot;The Father of Texas is no more; the first pioneer of the wilderness has departed.&quot; Originally, Austin was buried at Gulf Prairie Cemetery in Brazoria County, Texas. In 1910, Austin&#x27;s body was reinterred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin. Austin never married, nor did he have any children. He bequeathed all his land, titles, and possessions to his married sister, Emily Austin Perry.

==Past family==
While Stephen F. Austin and his sister Emily have each been the subject of a biography, they are descended from several generations of noteworthy people, including: Moses Austin (father—biography published by Trinity University Press), Abia Brown (grandfather), Joseph Sharp (great-grandfather), Isaac Sharp (great, great-grandfather), Anthony Sharp (great, great, great-grandfather—biography published by Stanford University Press). Accordingly, history records noteworthy social contributions in each generation of Stephen&#x27;s family dating back to the early seventeenth century. Richard Austin, a native of Titchfield, Hampshire was his paternal emigrant ancestor.

<text>The common swift (Apus apus) is a medium-sized bird, superficially similar to the barn swallow or house martin but somewhat larger, though not stemming from those passerine species, being in the order Apodiformes. The resemblances between the groups are due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar contextual development. The swifts&#x27; nearest relatives are the New World hummingbirds and the Southeast Asian treeswifts.

Its scientific name &quot;Apus&quot; is Latin for a swift, thought by the ancients to be a type of swallow with no feet (from Ancient Greek α, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;without&quot;, and πούς, &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;).

Swifts have very short legs which they use primarily for clinging to vertical surfaces (hence the German name &quot;Mauersegler&quot;, literally meaning &quot;wall-glider&quot;). They never settle voluntarily on the ground where they would be vulnerable to accidents and predation, and non-breeding individuals may spend up to ten months in continuous flight.

==Taxonomy==
The common swift was one of the many species described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He introduced the binomial name &quot;Hirundo apus&quot;. The current genus &quot;Apus&quot; was erected by the Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1777 based on tautonymy. The word &quot;apus&quot; is the Latin word for a swift. It is derived from the Ancient Greek α, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;without&quot;, and πούς, &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;, based on the belief that these birds were a form of swallow that lacked feet.

A Central European subspecies which lived during the last ice age has been described as &quot;Apus apus palapus&quot;.

==Description==
Common swifts are long with a wingspan of and entirely blackish-brown except for a small white or pale grey patch on their chins which is not visible from a distance. They have a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang.

Their call is a loud scream in two different tone pitches, the higher of which issues from the female. They often form &quot;screaming parties&quot; during summer evenings, when 10–20 swifts will gather in flight around their nesting area, calling out and being answered by nesting swifts. Larger &quot;screaming parties&quot; are formed at higher altitudes, especially late in the breeding season. The purpose of these parties is uncertain, but may include ascending to sleep on the wing, while still breeding adults tend to spend the night in the nest. Radar tracking of swifts at their breeding colonies has revealed that they often move together in flocks during their evening ascent and their dawn descent, but fly separately during the subsequent evening descent and the prior dawn ascent, suggesting that this flocking benefits the swifts via cue acquisition and information exchange between individuals or through extending social behaviour.

==Behaviour==


Swifts may nest in former woodpecker tree burrows found in ancient forests, such as some 600 reported nesting in the Białowieża Forest of North Eastern Poland, or the small colony found in a combination of woodpecker holes and tree nestboxes on the RSPB&#x27;s reserve at the Caledonian Forest in Abernethy, Scotland. While tree holes and cliffs may have comprised their historical nesting resource, the almost complete removal of ancient forest from their nesting range has resulted in adaptation to man-made sites. Swifts build their nests of air-borne material caught in flight, bonded with their saliva, in suitable buildings hollows, such as under tiles, in gaps beneath window sills, and most typically under eaves and within gables.

Swifts form pairs that may couple for years, and often return to the same nesting site and partner year after year, repairing degradation suffered in their 40-week migratory absence. Insects such as clothes moths, carpet and larder beetles may consume all but the most indigestible nest elements, typically feather shafts.

Young nesting swifts are able to survive for a few days without food by dropping their body temperature and metabolic rate, entering a torpid state.

Except when nesting, swifts spend their lives in the air, living on the insects caught in flight; they drink, feed, and often mate and sleep on the wing. Some individuals go 10 months without landing. No other bird spends as much of its life in flight. Contrary to common belief, swifts can take flight from level ground. Their maximum horizontal flying speed is Over a lifetime they can cover millions of kilometers.

Feeding parties can be very large in insect-rich areas, such as wetlands. Reports of as many as 2,000 swifts feeding over flooded gravel pits, lakes and marshy river deltas are not uncommon, and may represent an ingress of swifts from within as much as a radius; swifts nesting in Western Scotland are thought to venture to Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland to feed on the abundant and nutritious &quot;Lough Neagh Fly&quot;.

===Breeding===
Common swifts nest in a wider variety of sites than any other species of &quot;Apus&quot;. Swifts usually nest in buildings but they can also be found nesting in holes in trees, cliffs and crevices, and even in nestboxes. Swifts usually enter their nesting holes with direct flight, and take-off is characterized by an initial free-fall.

===Distribution===

Common swifts are migratory. Their summer breeding range runs from Portugal and Ireland in the West across to China and Siberia in the East. They breed as far south as Northern Africa (in Morocco and Algeria), with a presence in the Middle East in Israel, Lebanon and Syria, the Near East across Turkey, and the whole of Europe as far north as Norway, Finland, and most of sub-Arctic Russia. Swifts migrate to Africa by a variety of routes, ending up in Equatorial and Sub-Equatorial Africa, excluding the Cape. Common swifts do not breed on the Indian Subcontinent. Outside of their normal range, they are rare vagrants in North America, with records mostly originating from the United States and Canada, however; it has also been recorded in Bermuda and Greenland. Common swifts have also been recorded in the Caribbean, including in Bonaire, Barbados, and Puerto Rico. In South America, there are records in Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, and Colombia.

===Migration===
Subjects of a geolocator tracking study demonstrated that swifts breeding in Sweden winter in the Congo region of Africa. Swifts spend three to three-and-a-half months in Africa and a similar time breeding – the rest is spent on the wing, flying home or away. Unsuccessful breeders, fledglings, and sexually immature year-old birds are the first to leave their breeding area. Breeding males follow next, and finally the breeding females. The breeding females stay longer in the nest to rebuild their fat reserves. The time of departure is often determined by the light cycle, and begins at the first day of less than 17 hours light. For this reason, birds further north, for instance in Finland, leave later in the second half of August. These latecomers are rushed through the quickly shortening days in Central Europe and are barely seen by bird watchers.

The prevailing direction of travel through Central Europe is south-by-southwest, and so the Alps do not present a barrier. In bad weather, the swifts follow rivers, because they can find a better food supply there. The population of Western and Central Europe traverses the Iberian peninsula and northwestern Africa. Swifts from Russia and southeastern Europe make a long journey over the eastern part of the Mediterranean. It is unclear where the two groups meet. The western group of swifts mostly follow the Atlantic coastline of Africa – otherwise they would have to cross the Sahara. Once they arrive at the humid savanna, they turn southeast to arrive at their winter feeding grounds. During the summer in Africa, there is a great bounty of insects for the swifts, since the region lies in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The swifts have a nearly unbroken presence in the sky.

A few swifts, usually some of the sexually immature one year olds, remain in Africa. The majority fly northwards through Africa, then turn east towards their destinations. The birds use low pressure fronts during their spring migrations to exploit the southwestern flow of warm air, and on the return trip, ride northeastern winds on the back of the low pressure fronts.

In Central Europe, the swifts return in the second half of April and the first third of May, and like to stay in lowlands and near water rather than in high places. In more northerly regions, the swifts arrive later. The weather along the journey has an enormous influence on the arrival date, so in one region the swifts may come back at varying times year to year.
==Differences between swifts and swallows==

The barn swallow and house martin hunt for airborne insects in a manner similar to that of the slightly larger swift, and occasionally mixed groups of the species form. The most noticeable differences between the three types are:

* The shrill screaming call of the swift distinguishes itself from the more inconspicuous babbling of the swallow.
* The narrow sickle-shaped wings of the swift are longer than its body, and its silhouette in the air resembles an anchor.
* The swift&#x27;s wingbeats are deep and quick, and the swift glides for longer. The swallow&#x27;s flight is more fluttering, and it presses its wings further to the rear during beats.
* Although sometimes difficult to discern against a bright sky, the underside of a swift, with the exception of the white spot under its chin, is entirely dark brown. Swallows show a beige-white underside. They can also be recognized by the long forks in their tails.

==Parasites==
Swift nests commonly support populations of the chewing louse &quot;Dennyus hirundinis&quot; and the lousefly &quot;Crataerina pallida&quot;.

==In culture==
In medieval Italy, swifts (rondone) were encouraged to nest in towers and buildings using &quot;rondonare&quot;, holes left in the wall and special constructions under the eaves of buildings. Young birds were harvested for eating but there were rules about leaving at least one young in the nest.
The heraldic bird known as the &quot;martlet&quot;, which is represented without feet, may have been based on the swift, but is generally assumed to refer to the house martin; it was used for the arms of younger sons, perhaps because it symbolized their landless wandering.

<text>The barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) is the most widespread species of swallow in the world, occurring on all continents, with vagrants reported even in Antarctica. It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts and a long, deeply forked tail. In Anglophone Europe, it is just called the swallow; in northern Europe, it is the only member of family Hirundinidae called a &quot;swallow&quot; rather than a &quot;martin&quot;.

There are six subspecies of barn swallow, which breed across the Northern Hemisphere. Two subspecies, (&quot;H. r. savignii and H. r. transitiva&quot;) have fairly restricted ranges in the Nile valley and eastern Mediterranean, respectively. The other four are more widespread, with winter ranges covering much of the Southern Hemisphere.

The barn swallow is a bird of open country that normally nests in man-made structures and consequently has spread with human expansion. It builds a cup nest from mud pellets in barns or similar structures and feeds on insects caught in flight. This species lives in close association with humans, and its insect-eating habits mean that it is tolerated by humans; this acceptance was reinforced in the past by superstitions regarding the bird and its nest. There are frequent cultural references to the barn swallow in literary and religious works due to both its living in close proximity to humans and its annual migration. The barn swallow is the national bird of Austria and Estonia.

== Description ==
The adult male barn swallow of the nominate subspecies &quot;H. r. rustica&quot; is long including of elongated outer tail feathers. It has a wingspan of and weighs . It has steel blue upperparts and a rufous forehead, chin and throat, which are separated from the off-white underparts by a broad dark blue breast band. The outer tail feathers are elongated, giving the distinctive deeply forked &quot;swallow tail&quot;. There is a line of white spots across the outer end of the upper tail. The female is similar in appearance to the male, but the tail streamers are shorter, the blue of the upperparts and breast band is less glossy, and the underparts paler. The juvenile is browner and has a paler rufous face and whiter underparts. It also lacks the long tail streamers of the adult.

Although both sexes sing, female song was only recently described. (See below for details about song.) Calls include &quot;witt&quot; or &quot;witt-witt&quot; and a loud &quot;splee-plink&quot; when excited or trying to chase intruders away from the nest. The alarm calls include a sharp &quot;siflitt&quot; for predators like cats and a &quot;flitt-flitt&quot; for birds of prey like the hobby. This species is fairly quiet on the wintering grounds.

The distinctive combination of a red face and blue breast band renders the adult barn swallow easy to distinguish from the African &quot;Hirundo&quot; species and from the welcome swallow (&quot;Hirundo neoxena&quot;) with which its range overlaps in Australasia. In Africa the short tail streamers of the juvenile barn swallow invite confusion with juvenile red-chested swallow (&quot;Hirundo lucida&quot;), but the latter has a narrower breast band and more white in the tail.

== Taxonomy ==
The barn swallow was described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Hirundo rustica&quot;, characterised as &quot;H. rectricibus, exceptis duabus intermediis, macula alba notatîs&quot;. &quot;Hirundo&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;swallow&quot;; &quot;rusticus&quot; means &quot;of the country&quot;. This species is the only one of that genus to have a range extending into the Americas, with the majority of &quot;Hirundo&quot; species being native to Africa. This genus of blue-backed swallows is sometimes called the &quot;barn swallows&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates the English common name &quot;barn swallow&quot; to 1851, though an earlier instance of the collocation in an English-language context is in Gilbert White&#x27;s popular book &quot;The Natural History of Selborne&quot;, originally published in 1789:

The swallow, though called the chimney-swallow, by no means builds altogether in chimnies , but often within barns and out-houses against the rafters ... In &quot;Sweden&quot; she builds in barns, and is called &quot;ladusvala&quot;, the barn-swallow.
This suggests that the English name may be a calque on the Swedish term.

There are few taxonomic problems within the genus, but the red-chested swallow—a resident of West Africa, the Congo Basin, and Ethiopia—was formerly treated as a subspecies of barn swallow. The red-chested swallow is slightly smaller than its migratory relative, has a narrower blue breast-band, and (in the adult) has shorter tail streamers. In flight, it looks paler underneath than barn swallow.

=== Subspecies ===

Six subspecies of barn swallow are generally recognised. In eastern Asia, a number of additional or alternative forms have been proposed, including &quot;saturata&quot; by Robert Ridgway in 1883, &quot;kamtschatica&quot; by Benedykt Dybowski in 1883, &quot;ambigua&quot; by Erwin Stresemann and &quot;mandschurica&quot; by Wilhelm Meise in 1934. Given the uncertainties over the validity of these forms, this article follows the treatment of Turner and Rose.
* &quot;H. r. rustica&quot;, the nominate European subspecies, breeds in Europe and Asia, as far north as the Arctic Circle, south to North Africa, the Middle East and Sikkim, and east to the Yenisei River. It migrates on a broad front to winter in Africa, Arabia, and the Indian subcontinent. The barn swallows wintering in southern Africa are from across Eurasia to at least 91°E, and have been recorded as covering up to on their annual migration. The nominate European subspecies was the first to have its genome sequenced and published.
* &quot;H. r. transitiva&quot; was described by Ernst Hartert in 1910. It breeds in the Middle East from southern Turkey to Israel and is partially resident, though some birds winter in East Africa. It has orange-red underparts and a broken breast band. The holotype of &quot;Chelidon rustica transitiva&quot; Hartert (Vog. pal. Fauna, Heft 6, 1910. p. 802), an adult female, is held in the vertebrate zoology collection of National Museums Liverpool at World Museum, with accession number NML-VZ T2057. The specimen was collected in the Plains of Esdraclon, Palestine on 16 December 1863 by Henry Baker Tristram. The specimen came to the Liverpool national collection through the purchase of Canon Henry Baker Tristram&#x27;s collection by the museum in 1896.
* &quot;H. r. savignii&quot;, the resident Egyptian subspecies, was described by James Stephens in 1817 and named for French zoologist Marie Jules César Savigny. It resembles &quot;transitiva&quot;, which also has orange-red underparts, but &quot;savignii&quot; has a complete broad breast band and deeper red hue to the underparts.
* &quot;H. r. gutturalis&quot;, described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1786, has whitish underparts and a broken breast band. The breast is chestnut and the lower underparts more pink-buff. The populations that breed in the central and eastern Himalayas have been included in this subspecies, although the primary breeding range is Japan and Korea. The east Asian breeders winter across tropical Asia from India and Sri Lanka east to Indonesia and New Guinea. Increasing numbers are wintering in Australia. It hybridises with &quot;H. r. tytleri&quot; in the Amur River area. It is thought that the two eastern Asia forms were once geographically separate, but the nest sites provided by expanding human habitation allowed the ranges to overlap. &quot;H. r. gutturalis&quot; is a vagrant to Alaska and Washington, but is easily distinguished from the North American breeding subspecies, &quot;H. r. erythrogaster&quot;, by the latter&#x27;s reddish underparts.
* &quot;H. r. tytleri&quot;, first described by Thomas Jerdon in 1864, and named for British soldier, naturalist and photographer Robert Christopher Tytler, has deep orange-red underparts and an incomplete breast band. The tail is also longer. It breeds in central Siberia south to northern Mongolia and winters from eastern Bengal east to Thailand and Malaysia.
* &quot;H. r. erythrogaster&quot;, the North American subspecies described by Pieter Boddaert in 1783, differs from the European subspecies in having redder underparts and a narrower, often incomplete, blue breast band. It breeds throughout North America, from Alaska to southern Mexico, and migrates to the Lesser Antilles, Costa Rica, Panama and South America to winter. A few may winter in the southernmost parts of the breeding range. This subspecies funnels through Central America on a narrow front and is therefore abundant on passage in the lowlands of both coasts. Since the 1980s, small numbers of this subspecies have been found nesting in Argentina.

The short wings, red belly and incomplete breast band of &quot;H. r. tytleri&quot; are also found in &quot;H. r. erythrogaster&quot;, and DNA analyses show that barn swallows from North America colonised the Baikal region of Siberia, a dispersal direction opposite to that for most changes in distribution between North America and Eurasia.

== Behaviour ==
=== Habitat and range ===

The preferred habitat of the barn swallow is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, preferably with nearby water. This swallow avoids heavily wooded or precipitous areas and densely built-up locations. The presence of accessible open structures such as barns, stables, or culverts to provide nesting sites, and exposed locations such as wires, roof ridges or bare branches for perching, are also important in the bird&#x27;s selection of its breeding range.

Barn swallows are semi-colonial, settling in groups from a single pair to a few dozen pairs, particularly in larger wooden structures housing animals. The same individuals often breed at the same site year after year, although settlement choices have been experimentally shown to be predicted by nest availability rather than any characteristics of available mates. Because it takes around 2 weeks for a pair to build a nest from mud, hair, and other materials, old nests are highly prized.


This species breeds across the Northern Hemisphere from sea level to , but to in the Caucasus and North America, and it is absent only from deserts and the cold northernmost parts of the continents. Over much of its range, it avoids towns, and in Europe is replaced in urban areas by the house martin. However, in Honshū, Japan, the barn swallow is a more urban bird, with the red-rumped swallow (&quot;Cecropis daurica&quot;) replacing it as the rural species.

In winter, the barn swallow is cosmopolitan in its choice of habitat, avoiding only dense forests and deserts. It is most common in open, low vegetation habitats, such as savanna and ranch land, and in Venezuela, South Africa and Trinidad and Tobago it is described as being particularly attracted to burnt or harvested sugarcane fields and the waste from the cane. In the absence of suitable roost sites, they may sometimes roost on wires where they are more exposed to predators. Individual birds tend to return to the same wintering locality each year and congregate from a large area to roost in reed beds. These roosts can be extremely large; one in Nigeria had an estimated 1.5 million birds. These roosts are thought to be a protection from predators, and the arrival of roosting birds is synchronised in order to overwhelm predators like African hobbies. The barn swallow has been recorded as breeding in the more temperate parts of its winter range, such as the mountains of Thailand and in central Argentina.

Migration of barn swallows between Britain and South Africa was first established on 23 December 1912 when a bird that had been ringed by James Masefield at a nest in Staffordshire, was found in Natal. As would be expected for a long-distance migrant, this bird has occurred as a vagrant to such distant areas as Hawaii, Bermuda, Greenland, Tristan da Cunha, the Falkland Islands, and even Antarctica.

=== Feeding ===
The barn swallow is similar in its habits to other aerial insectivores, including other swallow species and the unrelated swifts. It is not a particularly fast flier, with a speed estimated at , up to and a wing beat rate of approximately 5, up to 7–9 times each second.

The barn swallow typically feeds in open areas above shallow water or the ground often following animals, humans or farm machinery to catch disturbed insects, but it will occasionally pick prey items from the water surface, walls and plants. Swallows have been observed feeding on insects that fly around active white stork nests as well. In the breeding areas, large flies make up around 70% of the diet, with aphids also a significant component. However, in Europe, the barn swallow consumes fewer aphids than the house or sand martins. On the wintering grounds, Hymenoptera, especially flying ants, are important food items. Grasshoppers, crickets, dragonflies, beetles and moths are also preyed upon. When egg-laying, barn swallows hunt in pairs, but otherwise will form often large flocks.

The amount of food a clutch will get depends on the size of the clutch, with larger clutches getting more food on average. The timing of a clutch also determines the food given; later broods get food that is smaller in size compared to earlier broods. This is because larger insects are too far away from the nest to be profitable in terms of energy expenditure.

Isotope studies have shown that wintering populations may utilise different feeding habitats, with British breeders feeding mostly over grassland, whereas Swiss birds utilised woodland more. Another study showed that a single population breeding in Denmark actually wintered in two separate areas.

The barn swallow drinks by skimming low over lakes or rivers and scooping up water with its open mouth. This bird bathes in a similar fashion, dipping into the water for an instant while in flight.

Swallows gather in communal roosts after breeding, sometimes thousands strong. Reed beds are regularly favoured, with the birds swirling &quot;en masse&quot; before swooping low over the reeds. Reed beds are an important source of food prior to and whilst on migration; although the barn swallow is a diurnal migrant that can feed on the wing whilst it travels low over ground or water, the reed beds enable fat deposits to be established or replenished.

=== Song ===
Males sing to defend small territories (when living in colonies, less so in solitary pairs) and to attract mates. Males sing throughout the breeding season, from late April into August in many parts of the range. Their song is made up of a &quot;twitter warble,&quot; followed by a rising &quot;P-syllable&quot; in European &quot;H. r. rustica&quot; and the North American &quot;H. r. erythrogaster.&quot; In all subspecies, this is followed by a short &quot;Q-syllable&quot; and a trilled series of pulses, termed the &quot;rattle.&quot; The rattle is sometimes followed by a terminal &quot;Ω-Note&quot; in some subspecies&#x27; populations, and always at the end of &quot;H. r. tytleri&quot; song.

Female songs are much shorter than male songs, and are only produced during the early part of the breeding season. Females sing spontaneously, though infrequently, and will also countersing in response to each other.

=== Breeding ===

The male barn swallow returns to the breeding grounds before the females and selects a nest site, which is then advertised to females with a circling flight and song. Plumage may be used to advertise: in some populations, like in the subspecies &quot;H. r. gutturalis&quot;, darker ventral plumage in males is associated with higher breeding success. In other populations, the breeding success of the male is related to the length of the tail streamers, with longer streamers being more attractive to the female. Males with longer tail feathers are generally longer-lived and more disease resistant, females thus gaining an indirect fitness benefit from this form of selection, since longer tail feathers indicate a genetically stronger individual which will produce offspring with enhanced vitality. Males in northern Europe have longer tails than those further south, whereas in Spain the male&#x27;s tail streamers are only 5% longer than the female&#x27;s; in Finland, the difference is 20%. In Denmark, the average male tail length increased by 9% between 1984 and 2004, but it is possible that climatic changes may lead in the future to shorter tails if summers become hot and dry.

Males with long streamers also have larger white tail spots, and since feather-eating bird lice prefer white feathers, large white tail spots without parasite damage again demonstrate breeding quality; a positive association exists between spot size and the number of offspring produced each season.

The breeding season of the barn swallow is variable: in the southern part of the range, the breeding season usually is from February or March to early to mid September, although some late second and third broods finish in October. In the northern part of the range, it usually starts late May to early June and ends the same time as the breeding season of the southernmost birds.

Both sexes defend the nest, but the male is particularly aggressive and territorial. Once established, pairs stay together to breed for life, but extra-pair copulation is common, making this species genetically polygamous, despite being socially monogamous. Males guard females actively to avoid being cuckolded. Males may use deceptive alarm calls to disrupt extrapair copulation attempts toward their mates.

As its name implies, the barn swallow typically nests inside accessible buildings such as barns and stables, or under bridges and wharves. Before man-made sites became common, it nested on cliff faces or in caves, but this is now rare. The neat cup-shaped nest is placed on a beam or against a suitable vertical projection. It is constructed by both sexes, although more often by the female, with mud pellets collected in their beaks and lined with grasses, feathers, algae or other soft materials. The nest building ability of the male is also sexually selected; females will lay more eggs and at an earlier date with males who are better at nest construction, with the opposite being true with males that are not. After building the nest, barn swallows may nest colonially where sufficient high-quality nest sites are available, and within a colony, each pair defends a territory around the nest which, for the European subspecies, is in size. Colony size tends to be larger in North America.

In North America at least, barn swallows frequently engage in a mutualist relationship with ospreys. Barn swallows will build their nest below an osprey nest, receiving protection from other birds of prey that are repelled by the exclusively fish-eating ospreys. The ospreys are alerted to the presence of these predators by the alarm calls of the swallows.

Barn swallows will normally raise two broods, with the original nest being reused for the second brood and being repaired and reused in subsequent years. The female lays two to seven, but typically four or five, reddish-spotted white eggs. The clutch size is influenced by latitude, with clutch sizes of northern populations being higher on average than southern populations. The eggs are in size, and weigh , of which 5% is shell. In Europe, the female does almost all the incubation, but in North America the male may incubate up to 25% of the time. The incubation period is normally 14–19 days, with another 18–23 days before the altricial chicks fledge. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, first-year birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood. Compared to those from early broods, juvenile barn swallows from late broods have been found to migrate at a younger age, fuel less efficiently during migration and have lower return rates the following year.

The barn swallow will mob intruders such as cats or accipiters that venture too close to their nest, often flying very close to the threat. Adult barn swallows have few predators, but some are taken by accipiters, falcons, and owls. Brood parasitism by cowbirds in North America or cuckoos in Eurasia is rare.

Hatching success is 90% and the fledging survival rate is 70–90%. Average mortality is 70–80% in the first year and 40–70% for the adult. Although the record age is more than 11 years, most survive less than four years. Barn swallow nestlings have prominent red gapes, a feature shown to induce feeding by parent birds. An experiment in manipulating brood size and immune system showed the vividness of the gape was positively correlated with T-cell–mediated immunocompetence, and that larger brood size and injection with an antigen led to a less vivid gape.

The barn swallow has been recorded as hybridising with the cliff swallow (&quot;Petrochelidon pyrrhonota&quot;) and the cave swallow (&quot;P. fulva&quot;) in North America, and the house martin (&quot;Delichon urbicum&quot;) in Eurasia, the cross with the latter being one of the most common passerine hybrids.

== Parasites and predators ==
Barn swallows (and other small passerines) often have characteristic feather holes on their wing and tail feathers. These holes were suggested as being caused by avian lice such as &quot;Machaerilaemus malleus&quot; and &quot;Myrsidea rustica&quot;, although other studies suggest that they are mainly caused by species of &quot;Brueelia&quot;. Several other species of lice have been described from barn swallow hosts, including &quot;Brueelia domestica&quot; and &quot;Philopterus microsomaticus&quot;. The avian lice prefer to feed on white tail spots, and they are generally found more numerously on short-tailed males, indicating the function of unbroken white tail spots as a measure of quality. In Texas, the swallow bug (&quot;Oeciacus vicarius&quot;), which is common on species such as the cliff swallow, is also known to infest barn swallows.

Predatory bats such as the greater false vampire bat are known to prey on barn swallows. Swallows at their communal roosts attract predators and several falcon species make use of these opportunities. Falcon species confirmed as predators include the peregrine falcon and the African hobby. In Africa, tigerfish &quot;Hydrocynus vittatus&quot; have been recorded to routinely leap out of the water to capture low-flying swallows.

== Status ==
The barn swallow has an enormous range, with an estimated global extent of about and a population of 190 million individuals. The species is evaluated as least concern on the 2019 IUCN Red List, and has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants.

This is a species that has greatly benefited historically from forest clearance, which has created the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation, which have given it an abundance of safe man-made nest sites. There have been local declines due to the use of DDT in Israel in the 1950s, competition for nest sites with house sparrows in the US in the 19th century, and an ongoing gradual decline in numbers in parts of Europe and Asia due to agricultural intensification, reducing the availability of insect food. However, there has been an increase in the population in North America during the 20th century with the greater availability of nesting sites and subsequent range expansion, including the colonisation of northern Alberta.

A specific threat to wintering birds from the European populations is the transformation by the South African government of a light aircraft runway near Durban into an international airport for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The roughly square Mount Moreland reed bed is a night roost for more than three million barn swallows, which represent 1% of the global population and 8% of the European breeding population. The reed bed lies on the flight path of aircraft using the proposed La Mercy airport, and there were fears that it would be cleared because the birds could threaten aircraft safety. However, following detailed evaluation, advanced radar technology will be installed to enable planes using the airport to be warned of bird movements and, if necessary, take appropriate measures to avoid the flocks.

Climate change may affect the barn swallow; drought causes weight loss and slow feather regrowth, and the expansion of the Sahara will make it a more formidable obstacle for migrating European birds. Hot dry summers will reduce the availability of insect food for chicks. Conversely, warmer springs may lengthen the breeding season and result in more chicks, and the opportunity to use nest sites outside buildings in the north of the range might also lead to more offspring.

== Relationship with humans ==
The barn swallow is an attractive bird that feeds on flying insects and has therefore been tolerated by humans when it shares their buildings for nesting. As one of the earlier migrants, this conspicuous species is also seen as an early sign of summer&#x27;s approach.

In the Old World, the barn swallow appears to have used man-made structures and bridges since time immemorial. An early reference is in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot; (29 BC), &quot;Ante garrula quam tignis nidum suspendat hirundo&quot; (Before the twittering swallow hangs its nest from the rafters).

Many cattle farmers believed that swallows spread &quot;Salmonella&quot; infections; however, a study in Sweden showed no evidence of the birds being reservoirs of the bacteria.

=== In literature ===
Many literary references are based on the barn swallow&#x27;s northward migration as a symbol of spring or summer. The proverb about the necessity for more than one piece of evidence goes back at least to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;: &quot;For as one swallow or one day does not make a spring, so one day or a short time does not make a fortunate or happy man.&quot;

The barn swallow symbolises the coming of spring and thus love in the &quot;Pervigilium Veneris&quot;, a late Latin poem. In his poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, T. S. Eliot quoted the line &quot;Quando fiam uti chelidon [ut tacere desinam]?&quot; (&quot;When will I be like the swallow, so that I can stop being silent?&quot;) This refers to the myth of Philomela in which she turns into a nightingale, and her sister Procne into a swallow.

=== In culture ===
Gilbert White studied the barn swallow in detail in his pioneering work &quot;The Natural History of Selborne&quot;, but even this careful observer was uncertain whether it migrated or hibernated in winter. Elsewhere, its long journeys were well observed, and a swallow tattoo is traditional among sailors as a symbol of a safe return; the tradition was that a mariner had a tattoo of this fellow wanderer after sailing . A second swallow would be added after at sea.

In the past, the tolerance for this beneficial insectivore was reinforced by superstitions regarding damage to the barn swallow&#x27;s nest. Such an act might lead to cows giving bloody milk, or no milk at all, or to hens ceasing to lay. This may be a factor in the longevity of swallows&#x27; nests. Survival, with suitable annual refurbishment, for 10–15 years is regular, and one nest was reported to have been occupied for 48 years.

It is depicted as the &quot;martlet&quot;, &quot;merlette&quot; or &quot;merlot&quot; in heraldry, where it represents younger sons who have no lands. It is also represented as lacking feet as this was a common belief at the time. As a result of a campaign by ornithologists, the barn swallow has been the national bird of Estonia since 23 June 1960, and is also the national bird of Austria.

<text>Realpolitik ( ; ) is the approach of conducting diplomatic or political policies based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than strictly following ideological, moral, or ethical premises. In this respect, it shares aspects of its philosophical approach with those of realism and pragmatism.

While generally used as a positive or neutral term, &quot;Realpolitik&quot; has been also used pejoratively to imply political policies that are perceived as being coercive, amoral, or Machiavellian. Prominent proponents of &quot;Realpolitik&quot; include Otto von Bismarck, Henry Kissinger, George H.W. Bush, George F. Kennan, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Deng Xiaoping, Charles de Gaulle, Donald Trump and Lee Kuan Yew. The opposite of &quot;Realpolitik&quot; is &quot;Idealpolitik&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Realpolitik&quot; was coined by Ludwig von Rochau, a German writer and politician in the 19th century. His 1853 book &quot;Grundsätze der Realpolitik angewendet auf die staatlichen Zustände Deutschlands&quot; (&quot;Principles of &quot;Realpolitik&quot; applied to the national state of affairs of Germany&quot;) describes the meaning of the term: 

Historian John Bew suggests that much of what stands for modern &quot;Realpolitik&quot; today deviates from the original meaning of the term. &quot;Realpolitik&quot; emerged in mid-19th century Europe from the collision of the Enlightenment with state formation and power politics. The concept, Bew argues, was an early attempt at answering the conundrum of how to achieve liberal enlightened goals in a world that does not follow liberal enlightened rules.

Rochau coined the term in 1853 and added a second volume in 1869 that further refined his earlier arguments. Rochau, exiled in Paris until the 1848 uprising, returned during the revolution and became a well-known figure in the National Liberal Party. As the liberal gains of the 1848 revolutions fell victim to coercive governments or were swallowed by powerful social forces such as class, religion and nationalism, Rochau—according to Bew—began to think hard about how the work that had begun with such enthusiasm had failed to yield any lasting results.

He said that the great achievement of the Enlightenment had been to show that might is not necessarily right. The mistake liberals made was to assume that the law of the strong had suddenly evaporated simply because it had been shown to be unjust. Rochau wrote that &quot;to bring down the walls of Jericho, the Realpolitiker knows the simple pickaxe is more useful than the mightiest trumpet&quot;. Rochau&#x27;s concept was seized upon by German thinkers in the mid and late 19th century and became associated with Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s statecraft in unifying Germany in the mid 19th century. By 1890, usage of the word &quot;Realpolitik&quot; was widespread, yet increasingly detached from its original meaning.

==Political realism in international relations==
Whereas &quot;Realpolitik&quot; refers to political practice, the concept of political realism in international relations refers to a theoretical framework aimed at offering explanations for events in the international relations domain. The theory of political realism proceeds from the assumption that states—as actors in the international arena—pursue their interests by practicing &quot;Realpolitik&quot;. Conversely, &quot;Realpolitik&quot; can be described as the exercise of policies that are in line with accepted theories of political realism. In either case, the working hypothesis is generally that policy is chiefly based on the pursuit, possession, and application of power (see also power politics). However, some international relations realists, such as Kenneth Waltz, have viewed state policy in terms of the pursuit of survival or security, rather than the pursuit of power for its own sake.

==History and branches==

See political realism for branches and antecedents more relevant to contemporary diplomacy and the particular modern, international relations paradigm.
* Sun Tzu, a Chinese military strategist who wrote &quot;The Art of War&quot; that foreshadowed elements of &quot;Realpolitik&quot;
* Thucydides, a Greek historian who wrote the &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; and is cited as an intellectual forebear of &quot;Realpolitik&quot;
* Chanakya (or Kautilya), an early Indian statesman and writer on the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;
* Ibn Khaldun, an Arab historiographer, historian and one of the founding fathers of modern historiography, author of Muqaddimah, a universal history of time
* Han Fei, a Chinese scholar who theorised Legalism and who served in the court of the King of Qin—later unifier of China ending the Warring States period. His theory centres on the Two Handles (about penalty and rewards as tools of governance). He theorised about a neutral, manipulative ruler who would act as head of state while secretly controlling the executive through his ministers—the ones to take real responsibility for any policy.
* Niccolò Machiavelli, an Italian political philosopher who wrote &quot;Il Principe&quot; (&quot;The Prince&quot;) in which he held that the sole aim of a monarch was to maintain himself and his authority, regardless of moral considerations. 
* Cardinal Richelieu, a French statesman who overcame domestic factionalism and guided France to a position of dominance in foreign affairs
* Thomas Hobbes, an English philosopher who wrote &quot;Leviathan&quot; in which he stated the state of nature was prone to a &quot;war of all against all&quot;
* Frederick the Great, a Prussian monarch who transformed Prussia into a great European power through warfare and diplomacy
* Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, a French diplomat who guided France and Europe through a variety of political systems
* Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, a Koblenz-born Austrian statesman opposed to political revolution
* Carl von Clausewitz, an 18–19th century Prussian general and military strategist who wrote &quot;On War&quot; (&quot;Vom Kriege&quot;)
* Camillo Benso of Cavour, an Italian statesman who diplomatically managed to maneuver the Kingdom of Sardinia to become a new great power in Europe, controlling a nearly united Italy that was five times as large as the Kingdom of Sardinia had been before he came to power
* Otto von Bismarck, a Prussian statesman who coined the term balance of power. Balancing power means keeping the peace and careful &quot;Realpolitik&quot; practitioners try to avoid arms races.
* 20th century proponents of political realism include Hans Morgenthau, Henry Kissinger, George F. Kennan as well as politicians such as Charles de Gaulle and Lee Kuan Yew.
* Mao Zedong&#x27;s Three Worlds Theory is described as &quot;Realpolitik&quot; by his critics, including Enver Hoxha, who argue that it was not based on a strong ideological grounding and used only to justify rapport with the West.

===China===
Even prior to the contemporary &quot;Realpolitik&quot; term, China has had a &quot;realistic&quot; tradition in its governance dating back thousands of years. Often referred to as Chinese Legalism, the spirit of its content may be most readily recognised by Western viewers through one of its kindred, &quot;The Art of War&quot;. Chinese administrative organisation significantly influenced other Asian nations as well as Western administrative practices not later than the 12th century, playing a significant role in the development of the modern state, including the usage of examinations for entry to the civil service.

Starting in the Spring and Autumn period (771–476/403 BC), a trend of &quot;realistic&quot; reformers were taken on to advance the material interest of their respective states, with the Qin state founding the first Chinese Empire, Qin dynasty in 221 BCE, ending China&#x27;s Warring States period. The political theory developed during the era, including that of Confucianism would influence every dynasty thereafter.

Those termed Legalist are more purely &quot;Realpolitikal&quot; in contrast to Confucianism and include non-legal Shen Pu-hai derived political technique, which charges the ruler engage in passive observation to determine facts rather than take on too much himself. Sinologist Herrlee G. Creel writes: &quot;If one wishes to exaggerate, it would no doubt be possible to translate (foundational Realist) Shen Buhai&#x27;s term Shu, or technique, as &#x27;science&#x27;, and argue that Pu-hai was the first political scientist,&quot; though Creel does &quot;not care to go this far&quot;.

During the Spring and Autumn period, the prevalent philosophy had dictated war as a gentleman&#x27;s activity; military commanders were instructed to respect what they perceived to be Heaven&#x27;s laws in battle. For example, when Duke Xiang of Song was at war with the state of Chu during the Warring States period, he declined an opportunity to attack the enemy force (commanded by Zhu) while they were crossing a river.

===Germany===

In the United States, the term is often analogous to power politics while in Germany &quot;Realpolitik&quot; has a somewhat less negative connotation, referring to realistic politics in opposition to idealistic (or unrealistic) politics. It is particularly associated with the era of 19th century nationalism. &quot;Realpolitik&quot; policies were employed in response to the failed Revolutions of 1848 as means to strengthen states and tighten social order.

The most famous German advocate of &quot;Realpolitik&quot;, what was uniquely possible and the applied means to achieve it, was Otto von Bismarck, the first Chancellor (1862–1890) to Wilhelm I of the Kingdom of Prussia. Bismarck used &quot;Realpolitik&quot; in his quest to achieve Prussian dominance in Germany. He manipulated political issues such as the Schleswig-Holstein question and the Hohenzollern candidature to antagonise other countries and cause wars if necessary to attain his goals. Such policies were characteristic of Bismarck, demonstrating a pragmatic view of the &quot;real&quot; political world.

Another example was his willingness to adopt some social policies of the socialists such as employee insurance and pensions; in doing so, he used small changes from the top down to avoid the possibility of major change from the bottom up. Likewise, Prussia&#x27;s seemingly illogical move of not demanding territory from a defeated Austria, a move that later led to the unification of Germany, is an oft-cited example of &quot;Realpolitik&quot;.

===Singapore===
Singaporean statesman Lee Kuan Yew, who served as the country&#x27;s first prime minister, has been considered by many political analysts as a pragmatist for his erudite policies in his governance of Singapore. He believed that the only way Singapore could survive as a relatively small nation as compared to its neighbours was to contrast itself from them, by building up a highly effective and non-corrupt government, in addition to a civil service, under a meritocratic system. He also believed that Singapore was to stay neutral but also possess a strong military capability, believing that it serves as a guarantor of the country&#x27;s independence due to its strategic position. A strong advocate for Asian values, he argued that Asian societies had different values from Western societies and that practicing such values was vital to succeed as a nation, especially as an Asian country, which includes collectivism and communitarianism.

Lee described Singapore&#x27;s only natural resources as being the grit of its people as well as their strong work ethic, propelling this mindset to all ethnic groups of the country. Although Lee supported left-wing ideas in his young adulthood, he was largely conservative as a leader, concluding that extensive state welfare and subsidies blunted the individual&#x27;s drive to succeed. Nevertheless, his government still enacted social policies, which included free public education up until at least secondary school, state housing, a compulsory comprehensive savings and pension plan, as well as universal healthcare, in addition to a civic nationalist stance.

In 1975, Chan Heng Chee described Singapore as a depoliticised &quot;administrative state&quot;, where ideology and politics had triumphantly been replaced by &quot;rational and scientific modes of public administration&quot;. It is suggested that by doggedly describing itself as pragmatic, the Singaporean state is actually disguising its ideological work and political nature through an assertion of the absence of ideology and politics. Chua Beng Huat argued in 1995 that the rhetoric of pragmatism in Singapore is ideological and hegemonic in nature, adopted and disseminated in the public sphere by the People&#x27;s Action Party government and institutionalised throughout the state in all its administrative, planning, and policy-making functions.

Many world leaders affirmed Lee&#x27;s political knowledge as being pragmatist and &quot;insightful&quot;. Former President of the United States, Barack Obama, stated that he &quot;personally appreciated [Lee&#x27;s] wisdom.&quot; Former Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, who had also championed for Asian values, stated that Lee was &quot;one of the greatest leaders of modern times that Asia has ever produced&quot; and a &quot;great Asian leader who laid the foundation for the prosperity of Singapore today.&quot; Former Prime Minister of Australia, Tony Abbott, mentioned that Lee was a &quot;giant of our region&quot; and that &quot;thanks to his vision and determination, Singapore is one of the world&#x27;s most successful countries.&quot; Henry Kissinger described Lee as one of the &quot;world&#x27;s most successful pragmatists&quot;. Today, his ideologies and views are now taught at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, an autonomous postgraduate school of the National University of Singapore .

===United Kingdom===
E. H. Carr was a liberal realist and left-wing British historian and international relations theorist who argued for realistic international over utopian policies. Carr described realism as the acceptance that what exists is right; he thus argued that in politics, realism meant that there is no moral dimension and that what is successful is right and what is unsuccessful is wrong. Carr was convinced that the Bolsheviks were destined to win the Russian Civil War and, under the grounds of &quot;Realpolitik&quot;, approved of British Prime Minister David Lloyd George&#x27;s opposition to War Secretary Winston Churchill&#x27;s support for military aid to the anti-Bolshevik White movement. In Carr&#x27;s opinion, Churchill&#x27;s support of the anti-Bolsheviks was folly, as Russia was likely to be a great power once more under the leadership of the Bolsheviks.

===United States===
American &quot;Realpolitik&quot; began in the 1960s with the influence of Polish-American Zbigniew Brzezinski, later National Security Advisor to Jimmy Carter. Contrary to McCarthy-era hostility and John Foster Dulles&#x27;s talk of the military &quot;liberation&quot; of the Eastern Bloc, Brzezinski proposed &quot;peaceful engagement&quot; with the Soviet Union while he advised Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Brzezinski, uninterested in promoting anti-Soviet propaganda for the benefit of the United States, felt the country would be more successful through frequent interactions with regimes and people under communist rule. Brzezinski knew the tough economic realities of those living in the Eastern Bloc, particularly the permanent shortage of goods, and that their attachment to the Soviet Union was born of historic necessity, rather than common ideology. Brzezinski suggested enticing these countries economically and through educational and cultural exchanges, which would appeal to intellectuals, followed by favouritism for regimes showing signs of liberalisation or less reliance on Moscow. Through that approach, Brzezinski &quot;offered a realistic, evolutionary alternative to empty political rhetoric.&quot;

Henry Kissinger has been credited with formally introducing the policy of &quot;Realpolitik&quot; to the White House as Secretary of State to Richard Nixon. In that context, the policy meant dealing with other powerful nations in a practical manner, rather than on the basis of political doctrine or ethics such as Nixon&#x27;s diplomacy with the People&#x27;s Republic of China despite U.S. opposition to communism and the previous doctrine of containment. Another example is Kissinger&#x27;s use of shuttle diplomacy after the Yom Kippur War in 1973, when he persuaded the Israelis to withdraw partially from the Sinai in deference to the political realities created by the oil crisis.

Kissinger himself said that he had never used the term &quot;Realpolitik&quot; and stated that it is used by both liberal and realist foreign policy thinkers to label, criticise, and facilitate a choosing of sides. Kissinger had looked at what he implemented while he served as Secretary of State and National Security Advisor not in the confines of making &quot;Realpolitik&quot; a standard policy, but within the terms of being a statesman. That political mindset can be seen in Kissinger&#x27;s book &quot;A World Restored&quot; and was pointed out by historian John Bew in his book &quot;Realpolitik&quot;. Kissinger went on to say that the role of the statesman is &quot;the ability to recognize the real relationship of forces and to make this knowledge serve his ends.&quot;

In that context, one can see how &quot;Realpolitik&quot; principles can influence U.S. policy but not as standard policy. The reach and influence of &quot;Realpolitik&quot; is found instead in pragmatic and flexible policy that changes to the needs of the situation. That type of policymaking could be seen as recently as in the administration of Barack Obama. Bew made note of that direction in the Obama administration, when Obama&#x27;s chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, remarked in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that everyone wanted to break it down into contrasts of idealist and realist, but &quot;if you had to put him in a category, he&#x27;s probably more realpolitik, like Bush 41 [...] You’ve got to be cold-blooded about the self-interests of your nation.&quot;

&quot;Realpolitik&quot; is distinct from ideological politics in that it is not dictated by a fixed set of rules but instead tends to be goal-oriented, limited only by practical exigencies. Since &quot;Realpolitik&quot; is ordered toward the most practical means of securing national interests, it can often entail compromising on ideological principles. For example, during the Cold War, the United States often supported authoritarian regimes that were human rights violators to secure theoretically the greater national interest of regional stability. After the end of the Cold War, this practice continued.

Most recently, former Ambassador Dennis Ross advocated that approach to foreign policy in his 2007 book &quot;Statecraft: And How to Restore America&#x27;s Standing in the World&quot;. For the purposes of contrast and speaking in ideal types, political ideologues would tend to favor principle over other considerations. Such individuals or groups can reject compromises that they see as the abandonment of their ideals and so may sacrifice political gain, in favor of adhering to principles that they believe to be constitutive of long-term goals.

===Pakistan===
Relations between Pakistan and the U.S. were strained during the 1970s due to Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear program and the controversial execution of President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. 

In the context of the Iranian Revolution, President Jimmy Carter desired to improve relations with Pakistan. General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq came into power in 1977 after martial law was imposed in the country due to political turmoil. Zia recognised the immediate strategic interests that Pakistan may obtain by aligning with the U.S. amidst the Soviet–Afghan War.

Pakistan due to its strategic geopolitical location made it a subject of grave interest to the U.S., which supported Pakistan with financial and military assistance including General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and financial aid during the Soviet–Afghan War.

Zia initially declined the 400 million USD aid offered by the U.S. (under the Carter administration) dismissing it as &quot;peanuts&quot;. However, when Ronald Reagan entered office and sought to increment the funding for Operation Cyclone and aid for Pakistan, the U.S. and Pakistan agreed on a 3.2 billion USD military and economic aid package. 

Under Zia&#x27;s leadership, Pakistan played a pivotal role in training the Afghan mujahidin, in conjunction with Operation Cyclone to oppose the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan.

While Pakistan was aligned with the United States, it did maintain diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union during the Afghan war which was primarily based upon pragmatic diplomacy rather than genuine partnership.

One of the major &quot;Realpolitik&quot; decision of Zia&#x27;s presidency was his role in the nuclear program of Pakistan. Amidst international pressure, he ignored threats of sanctions and prioritised the national interest over non-proliferation international norms. The development of nuclear weapons was seen as crucial for deterrence against Pakistan&#x27;s historical rival, India, which had successfully conducted nuclear tests in 1974.

<text>The Dreyfus affair (, ) was a political scandal that divided the Third French Republic from 1894 until its resolution in 1906. The scandal began in December 1894 when Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a 35-year-old Alsatian French artillery officer of Jewish descent, was wrongfully convicted of treason for communicating French military secrets to the German Embassy in Paris. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and sent overseas to the penal colony on Devil&#x27;s Island in French Guiana, where he spent the following five years imprisoned in very harsh conditions.

In 1896, evidence came to light—primarily through the investigations of Lieutenant Colonel Georges Picquart, head of counter-espionage—which identified the real culprit as a French Army major named Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy. High-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence, and a military court unanimously acquitted Esterhazy after a trial lasting only two days. The Army laid additional charges against Dreyfus, based on forged documents. Subsequently, writer Émile Zola&#x27;s open letter in the newspaper stoked a growing movement of political support for Dreyfus, putting pressure on the government to reopen the case.

In 1899, Dreyfus was returned to France for another trial. The intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided French society between those who supported Dreyfus, the &quot;Dreyfusards&quot; such as Sarah Bernhardt, Anatole France, Charles Péguy, Henri Poincaré, Georges Méliès, and Georges Clemenceau; and those who condemned him, the &quot;anti-Dreyfusards&quot; such as Édouard Drumont, the director and publisher of the antisemitic newspaper . The new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year sentence, but Dreyfus was pardoned and released. In 1906, Dreyfus was exonerated. After being reinstated as a major in the French Army, he served during the whole of World War I, ending his service with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He died in 1935.

The Dreyfus affair came to symbolise modern injustice in the Francophone world; it remains one of the most notable examples of a miscarriage of justice and of antisemitism. The affair divided France into pro-republican, anticlerical Dreyfusards and pro-army, mostly Catholic anti-Dreyfusards, embittering French politics and encouraging radicalisation. The press played a crucial role in exposing information and in shaping and expressing public opinion on both sides of the conflict.
== Contexts ==

=== Political ===
In 1894, the Third Republic was twenty-four years old. Although the 16 May Crisis in 1877 had crippled the political influence of both the Bourbon and Orléanist royalists, its ministries continued to be short-lived as the country lurched from crisis to crisis: three years immediately preceding the Dreyfus affair were the near-coup of Georges Boulanger in 1889, the Panama scandals in 1892, and the anarchist threat (reduced by the &quot;villainous laws&quot; of July 1894). The elections of 1893 were focused on the &quot;social question&quot; and resulted in a Republican victory (just under half the seats) against the conservative right, and the reinforcement of the Radicals (about 150 seats) and Socialists (about 50 seats).

The opposition of the Radicals and Socialists resulted in a centrist government with policies oriented towards economic protectionism, a certain indifference to social issues, a willingness to break international isolation, the Russian alliance, and development of the colonial empire. These centrist policies resulted in cabinet instability, with some Republican members of the government sometimes aligning with the radicals and some Orléanists aligning with the Legitimists in five successive governments from 1893 to 1896. This instability coincided with an equally unstable presidency: President Sadi Carnot was assassinated on 24 June 1894; his moderate successor Jean Casimir-Perier resigned several months later on 15 January 1895 and was replaced by Félix Faure.

Following the failure of the radical government of Léon Bourgeois in 1896, the president appointed Jules Méline as prime minister. His government faced the opposition of the left and of some Republicans (including the Progressive Union) and made sure to keep the support of the right. He sought to appease religious, social, and economic tensions and conducted a fairly conservative policy. He succeeded in improving stability, and it was under this stable government that the Dreyfus affair occurred.

=== Military ===
The Dreyfus affair occurred in the context of German annexation of Alsace and Moselle, an event that fed the most extreme nationalism. The traumatic defeat of France in 1870 seemed far away, but a vengeful spirit remained. 

The military required considerable resources to prepare for the next conflict, and it was in this spirit that the Franco-Russian Alliance of 27 August 1892 was signed, although some opponents thought it &quot;against nature&quot;. The army had recovered from the defeat, but many of its officers were aristocrats and monarchists. Cult of the flag and contempt for the parliamentary republic prevailed in the army. The Republic celebrated its army; the army ignored the Republic.

Over the previous ten years the army had undergone a significant shift resulting from its twofold aim to democratize and modernize. The graduates of the École Polytechnique now competed effectively with officers from the main career path of Saint-Cyr, which caused strife, bitterness, and jealousy among junior officers expecting promotions. The period was also marked by an arms race that primarily affected artillery. There were improvements in heavy artillery (guns of 120 mm and 155 mm, Models 1890 Baquet, new hydropneumatic brakes), but also, and especially, development of the ultra-secret 75mm gun.

The operation of military counterintelligence, alias the &quot;Statistics Section&quot; (SR), should be noted. Spying as a tool for secret war was a novelty as an organised activity by governments in the late 19th century. The Statistics Section was created in 1871 but consisted of only a handful of officers and civilians. Its head in 1894 was Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Sandherr, a graduate of Saint-Cyr, an Alsatian from Mulhouse, and a convinced antisemite. Its military mission was clear: to retrieve information about potential enemies of France and to feed them false information. The Statistics Section was supported by the &quot;Secret Affairs&quot; of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was headed by a young diplomat, Maurice Paléologue.

The arms race created an acute atmosphere of intrigue from 1890 in French counter-espionage. One of the missions of the section was to spy on the German Embassy at Rue de Lille in Paris to thwart any attempt by the French to transmit important information to the Germans. This was especially critical since several cases of espionage had already been featured in the headlines of newspapers, which were fond of sensationalism. In 1890, the archivist Boutonnet was convicted for selling plans of shells that used melinite.

The German military attaché in Paris in 1894 was Count Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen, who developed a policy of infiltration that appears to have been effective. In the 1880s Schwartzkoppen had begun an affair with an Italian military attaché, Lieutenant Colonel Count Alessandro Panizzardi. While neither had anything to do with Dreyfus, their intimate and erotic correspondence (e.g. &quot;Don&#x27;t exhaust yourself with too much buggery.&quot;), which was obtained by the authorities, lent an air of truth to other documents that were forged by prosecutors to lend retroactive credibility to Dreyfus&#x27;s conviction as a spy. Some of these forgeries referred to the real affair between the two officers; in one, Alessandro supposedly informed his lover that if &quot;Dreyfus is brought in for questioning&quot;, they must both claim that they &quot;never had any dealings with that Jew. ... Clearly, no one can ever know what happened with him.&quot;

The letters, real and fake, provided a convenient excuse for placing the entire Dreyfus dossier under seal, given that exposure of the liaison would have &#x27;dishonoured&#x27; Germany and Italy&#x27;s military and compromised diplomatic relations. As homosexuality was, like Judaism, then often perceived as a sign of national degeneration, recent historians have suggested that combining them to inflate the scandal may have shaped the prosecution strategy.

Since early 1894, the Statistics Section had investigated traffic in master plans for Nice and the Meuse conducted by an officer whom the Germans and Italians nicknamed Dubois. This is what led to the origins of the Dreyfus affair.

=== Social ===

The social context was marked by the rise of nationalism and antisemitism. The growth of antisemitism, virulent since the publication of &quot;Jewish France&quot; by Édouard Drumont in 1886 (150,000 copies in the first year), went hand in hand with the rise of clericalism. Tensions were high in all strata of society, fueled by an influential press, which was virtually free to write and disseminate any information even if offensive or defamatory. Legal risks were limited if the target was a private person.

Antisemitism did not spare the military, which practised hidden discrimination with the &quot;cote d&#x27;amour&quot; (a subjective assessment of personal acceptability) system of irrational grading, encountered by Dreyfus in his application to the Bourges School. However, while prejudices of this nature undoubtedly existed within the confines of the General Staff, the French Army as a whole was relatively open to individual talent. At the time of the Dreyfus affair there were an estimated 300 Jewish officers in the army (about 3 per cent of the total), of whom ten were generals.

The popularity of the duel using sword or small pistol, sometimes causing death, bore witness to the tensions of the period. When a series of press articles in &quot;La Libre Parole&quot; accused Jewish officers of &quot;betraying their birth&quot;, the officers challenged the editors. Captain Crémieu-Foa, a Jewish Alsatian graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique, fought unsuccessfully against Drumont and against M. de Lamase, who was the author of the articles. Captain Mayer, another Jewish officer, was killed by the Marquis de Morès, a friend of Drumont, in another duel.

Hatred of Jews was now public and violent, driven by a firebrand (Drumont) who demonized the Jewish presence in France. Jews in metropolitan France in 1895 numbered about 80,000 (40,000 in Paris alone), who were highly integrated into society; an additional 45,000 Jews lived in Algeria. The launch of &quot;La Libre Parole&quot; with a circulation estimated at 200,000 copies in 1892, allowed Drumont to expand his audience to a popular readership already enticed by the boulangiste adventure in the past. The antisemitism circulated by &quot;La Libre Parole&quot;, as well as by &quot;L&#x27;Éclair&quot;, &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;, &quot;La Patrie&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Intransigeant&quot; and &quot;La Croix&quot;, drew on antisemitic roots in certain Catholic circles.

Publications remarking on the Dreyfus affair often reinforced antisemitic sentiments, language and imagery. The &quot;&quot; was a collection of anti-Dreyfus posters illustrated by Victor Lenepveu during the Dreyfus affair. Lenepveu caricatured &quot;prominent Jews, Dreyfus supporters, and Republican statesman&quot;. &quot;No. 35 Amnistie populaire&quot; depicts the corpse of Dreyfus himself as it dangles from a noose. Large noses, money, and Lenepveu&#x27;s general tendency to illustrate subjects with bodies of animals likely contributed to the dissemination of antisemitism in French popular culture.

== Origins of the case and the trial of 1894 ==

=== Discovery of the &quot;bordereau&quot; ===
The staff of the Military Intelligence Service (SR) worked around the clock to spy on the German Embassy in Paris. They had managed to get a French housekeeper named &quot;Madame Bastian&quot; hired to work in the building and spy on the Germans. In September 1894, she found a torn-up note which she handed over to her employers at the Military Intelligence Service. This note later became known as &quot;the bordereau&quot;. This piece of paper, torn into six large pieces, unsigned and undated, was addressed to the German military attaché stationed at the German Embassy, Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen. It stated that confidential French military documents regarding the newly developed &quot;hydraulic brake of 120, and the way this gun has worked&quot; were about to be sent to a foreign power.

=== The search for the author of the bordereau ===
This catch seemed of sufficient importance for the head of the &quot;Statistical Section&quot;, the Mulhousian Jean Sandherr, to inform the Minister of War, General Auguste Mercier. In fact the SR suspected that there had been leaks since the beginning of 1894 and had been trying to find the perpetrator. The minister had been harshly attacked in the press for his actions, which were deemed incompetent, and appears to have sought an opportunity to enhance his image. He immediately initiated two secret investigations, one administrative and one judicial. To find the culprit, using simple though crude reasoning, the circle of the search was arbitrarily restricted to suspects posted to, or former employees of, the General Staff – necessarily a trainee artillery officer.

The ideal culprit was identified: Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a graduate of the École polytechnique and an artillery officer, of the Jewish faith and of Alsatian origin, coming from the republican meritocracy. At the beginning of the case, the emphasis was rather on the Alsatian origins of Dreyfus than on his religion. These origins were not, however, exceptional because these officers were favoured by France for their knowledge of the German language and culture. There was also antisemitism in the offices of the General Staff, and it fast became central to the affair by filling in the credibility gaps in the preliminary enquiry. In particular, Dreyfus was at that time the only Jewish officer to be recently passed by the General Staff.

In fact, the reputation of Dreyfus as a cold and withdrawn or even haughty character, as well as his &quot;curiosity&quot;, worked strongly against him. These traits of character, some false, others natural, made the charges plausible by turning the most ordinary acts of everyday life in the ministry into proof of espionage. From the beginning a biased and one-sided multiplication of errors led the State to a false position. This was present throughout the affair, where irrationality prevailed over the positivism in vogue in that period:

=== Expertise in writing ===
To condemn Dreyfus, the writing on the bordereau had to be compared to that of the Captain. There was nobody competent to analyse the writing on the General Staff. Then Major du Paty de Clam entered the scene: an eccentric man who prided himself on being an expert in graphology. On being shown some letters by Dreyfus and the bordereau on 5 October, du Paty concluded immediately who had written the two writings. After a day of additional work he provided a report that, despite some differences, the similarities were sufficient to warrant an investigation. Dreyfus was therefore &quot;the probable author&quot; of the bordereau in the eyes of the General Staff.
General Mercier believed he had the guilty party, but he exaggerated the value of the affair, which took on the status of an affair of state during the week preceding the arrest of Dreyfus. The Minister did consult and inform all the authorities of the State, yet despite prudent counsel and courageous objections expressed by Gabriel Hanotaux in the Council of Ministers he decided to pursue it. Du Paty de Clam was appointed Judicial Police Officer to lead an official investigation.

Meanwhile, several parallel sources of information were opening up, some on the personality of Dreyfus, others to ensure the truth of the identity of the author of the bordereau. The expert Gobert was not convinced and found many differences. He even wrote that &quot;the nature of the writing on the bordereau excludes disguised handwriting&quot;. Disappointed, Mercier then called in Alphonse Bertillon, the inventor of forensic anthropometry but no handwriting expert. He was initially no more positive than Gobert but he did not exclude the possibility of its being the writing of Dreyfus. Later, under pressure from the military, he argued that Dreyfus had autocopied it and developed his theory of &quot;autoforgery&quot;.

=== The arrest ===
On 13 October 1894, without any tangible evidence and with an empty file, General Mercier summoned Captain Dreyfus for a general inspection in &quot;bourgeois clothing&quot;, i.e. in civilian clothes. The purpose of the General Staff was to obtain the perfect proof under French law: a confession. That confession was to be obtained by surprise – by dictating a letter based on the bordereau to reveal his guilt.

On the morning of 15 October 1894, Captain Dreyfus underwent this ordeal but admitted nothing. Du Paty even tried to suggest suicide by placing a revolver in front of Dreyfus, but he refused to take his life, saying he &quot;wanted to live to establish his innocence&quot;. The hopes of the military were crushed. Nevertheless Du Paty de Clam still arrested the captain, accused him of conspiring with the enemy, and told him that he would be brought before a court-martial. Dreyfus was imprisoned at the Cherche-Midi prison in Paris.

=== The enquiry and the first military court ===

Mrs. Dreyfus was informed of the arrest the same day by a police raid to search their apartment. She was terrorized by Du Paty, who ordered her to keep the arrest of her husband secret and even said, &quot;One word, one single word and it will be a European war!&quot; Illegally, Dreyfus was placed in solitary confinement in prison, where Du Paty interrogated him day and night in order to obtain a confession, which failed. The captain was morally supported by the first Dreyfusard, Major Forzinetti, commandant of the military prisons of Paris.

On 29 October 1894, the affair was revealed in an article in &quot;La Libre Parole&quot;, the antisemitic newspaper owned by Édouard Drumont. This marked the beginning of a very brutal press campaign until the trial. This event put the affair in the field of antisemitism where it remained until its conclusion.

On 1 November 1894, Alfred&#x27;s brother, Mathieu Dreyfus, became aware of the arrest after being called urgently to Paris. He became the architect of the arduous fight for the liberation of his brother. Without hesitation, he began looking for a lawyer, and retained the distinguished criminal lawyer Edgar Demange.

=== The enquiry ===
On 3 November 1894, General Saussier, the Military governor of Paris, reluctantly gave the order for an enquiry. He had the power to stop the process but did not, perhaps because of an exaggerated confidence in military justice. Major Besson d&#x27;Ormescheville, the recorder for the Military Court, wrote an indictment in which &quot;moral elements&quot; of the charge (which gossiped about the habits of Dreyfus and his alleged attendance at &quot;gambling circles&quot;, his knowledge of German, and his &quot;remarkable memory&quot;) were developed more extensively than the &quot;material elements&quot;, which are rarely seen in the charge:

&quot;This is a proof of guilt because Dreyfus made everything disappear&quot;.

The complete lack of neutrality of the indictment led to Émile Zola calling it a &quot;monument of bias&quot;.

After the news broke on Dreyfus&#x27; arrest, many journalists flocked to the story and flooded the story with speculations and accusations. The renowned journalist and antisemitic agitator Edouard Drumont wrote in his publication on November 3, 1894, &quot;What a terrible lesson, this disgraceful treason of the Jew Dreyfus.&quot;

On 4 December 1894, Dreyfus was referred to the first Military Court with this dossier. The secrecy was lifted and Demange could access the file for the first time. After reading it the lawyer had absolute confidence, as he saw the emptiness of the prosecution&#x27;s case. The prosecution rested completely on the writing on a single piece of paper, the bordereau, on which experts disagreed, and on vague indirect testimonies.

=== The trial: &quot;Closed Court or War!&quot; ===
During the two months before the trial, the press went wild. &quot;La Libre Parole&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Autorité&quot;, &quot;Le Journal&quot;, and &quot;Le Temps&quot; described the supposed life of Dreyfus through lies and bad fiction.
This was also an opportunity for extreme headlines from &quot;La Libre Parole&quot; and &quot;La Croix&quot; to justify their previous campaigns against the presence of Jews in the army on the theme &quot;You have been told!&quot; This long delay above all enabled the General Staff to prepare public opinion and to put indirect pressure on the judges. On 8 November 1894, General Mercier declared Dreyfus guilty in an interview with &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. He repeated himself on 29 November 1894 in an article by Arthur Meyer in &quot;Le Gaulois&quot;, which in fact condemned the indictment against Dreyfus and asked, &quot;How much freedom will the military court have to judge the defendant?&quot;

The jousting of the columnists took place within a broader debate about the issue of a closed court. For Ranc and Cassagnac, who represented the majority of the press, the closed court was a low manoeuvre to enable the acquittal of Dreyfus, &quot;because the minister is a coward&quot;. The proof was &quot;that he &quot;grovels&quot; before the Prussians&quot; by agreeing to publish the denials of the German ambassador in Paris. In other newspapers, such as &quot;L&#x27;Éclair&quot; on 13 December 1894: &quot;the closed court is necessary to avoid a &quot;casus belli&quot;&quot;; while for Judet in &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; of 18 December: &quot;the closed court is our impregnable refuge against Germany&quot;; or in &quot;La Croix&quot; the same day: it must be &quot;the most absolute closed court&quot;.

The trial opened on 19 December 1894 at one o&#x27;clock and a closed court was immediately pronounced. This closed court was not legally consistent since Major Picquart and Prefect Louis Lépine were present at certain proceedings in violation of the law. The closed court allowed the military to avoid disclosing the emptiness of their evidence to the public and to stifle debate. As expected, the emptiness of their case appeared clearly during the hearings. Detailed discussions on the bordereau showed that Captain Dreyfus could not be the author. At the same time the accused himself protested his innocence and defended himself point by point with energy and logic. Moreover, his statements were supported by a dozen defense witnesses. Finally, the absence of motive for the crime was a serious thorn in the prosecution case. Dreyfus was indeed a very patriotic officer highly rated by his superiors, very rich and with no tangible reason to betray France. The fact of Dreyfus&#x27;s Jewishness, which was used extensively by the right-wing press, was not openly presented in court.

Alphonse Bertillon, an eccentric criminologist who was not an expert in handwriting, was presented as a scholar of the first importance. He advanced the theory of &quot;autoforgery&quot; during the trial and accused Dreyfus of imitating his own handwriting, explaining the differences in writing by using extracts of writing from his brother Matthieu and his wife Lucie. This theory, although later regarded as bizarre and astonishing, seems to have had some effect on the judges. In addition, Major Hubert-Joseph Henry, deputy head of the SR and discoverer of the &quot;bordereau&quot;, made a theatrical statement in open court. He argued that leaks betraying the General Staff had been suspected to exist since February 1894 and that &quot;a respectable person&quot; accused Captain Dreyfus. He swore on oath that the traitor was Dreyfus, pointing to the crucifix hanging on the wall of the court. Dreyfus was apoplectic with rage and demanded to be confronted with his anonymous accuser, which was rejected by the General Staff. The incident had an undeniable effect on the court, which was composed of seven officers who were both judges and jury. However, the outcome of the trial remained uncertain. The conviction of the judges had been shaken by the firm and logical answers of the accused. The judges took leave to deliberate, but the General Staff still had a card in hand to tip the balance decisively against Dreyfus.

=== Transmission of a secret dossier to the judges ===
Military witnesses at the trial alerted high command about the risk of acquittal. For this eventuality the Statistics Section had prepared a file containing, in principle, four &quot;absolute&quot; proofs of the guilt of Captain Dreyfus accompanied by an explanatory note. The contents of this secret file remained uncertain until 2013, when they were released by the French Ministry of Defence. Recent research indicates the existence of numbering which suggests the presence of a dozen documents. Among these letters were some of an erotic homosexual nature (the Davignon letter among others) raising the question of the tainted methods of the Statistics Section and the objective of their choice of documents.

The secret file was illegally submitted at the beginning of the deliberations by the President of the Military Court, Colonel Émilien Maurel, by order of the Minister of War, General Mercier. Later at the Rennes trial of 1899, General Mercier explained (falsely) the nature of the prohibited disclosure of the documents submitted in the courtroom. This file contained, in addition to letters without much interest, some of which were falsified, a piece known as the &quot;Scoundrel D ...&quot;.

It was a letter from the German military attaché, Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen, to the Italian military attaché, Lieutenant Colonel Alessandro Panizzardi, intercepted by the SR. The letter was supposed to accuse Dreyfus definitively since, according to his accusers, it was signed with the initial of his name. In reality, the Statistics Section knew that the letter could not be attributed to Dreyfus and if it was, it was with criminal intent. Colonel Maurel confirmed in the second Dreyfus trial that the secret documents were not used to win the support of the judges of the Military Court. He contradicted himself, however, by saying that he read only one document, &quot;which was enough&quot;.

=== Conviction, degradation, and deportation ===
On 22 December 1894, after several hours of deliberation, the verdict was reached. Seven judges unanimously convicted Alfred Dreyfus of collusion with a foreign power, to the maximum penalty under section 76 of the Criminal Code: &quot;permanent exile in a walled fortification&quot; (prison), the cancellation of his army rank and military degradation, also known as cashiering. Dreyfus was not sentenced to death, as it had been abolished for political crimes since 1848.

For the authorities, the press and the public, doubts had been dispelled by the trial and his guilt was certain. Right and left regretted the abolition of the death penalty for such a crime. Antisemitism peaked in the press and occurred in areas so far spared. Socialist leader Jean Jaurès regretted the lightness of the sentence in an address to the Chamber of Deputies and wrote, &quot;A soldier has been sentenced to death and executed for throwing a button in the face of his corporal. So why leave this miserable traitor alive?&quot; Radical Republican Georges Clemenceau in &quot;La&quot; &quot;Justice&quot; made a similar comment.

On 5 January 1895, the ceremony of degradation took place in the Morlan Court of the Military School in Paris. While the drums rolled, Dreyfus was accompanied by four artillery officers, who brought him before an officer of the state who read the judgment. A Republican Guard adjutant tore off his badges, thin strips of gold, his stripes, cuffs and sleeves of his jacket. As he was paraded throughout the streets, the crowd chanted &quot;Death to Judas, death to the Jew.&quot; Witnesses report the dignity of Dreyfus, who continued to maintain his innocence while raising his arms: &quot;Innocent, Innocent! Long live France! Long live the army&quot;. The Adjutant broke his sword on his knee and then the condemned Dreyfus marched at a slow pace in front of his former companions. An event known as &quot;the legend of the confession&quot; took place before the degradation. In the van that brought him to the military school, Dreyfus is said to have confided his treachery to Captain Lebrun-Renault. It appears that this was merely self-promotion by the captain of the Republican Guard, and that in reality Dreyfus had made no admission. Due to the affair&#x27;s being related to national security, the prisoner was then held in solitary confinement in a cell awaiting transfer. On 17 January 1895, he was transferred to the prison on Île de Ré where he was held for over a month. He had the right to see his wife twice a week in a long room, each of them at one end, with the director of the prison in the middle.

At the last minute, at the initiative of General Mercier, a law was passed on 9 February 1895, restoring the Îles du Salut in French Guiana, as a place of fortified deportation so that Dreyfus was not sent to Ducos, New Caledonia. Indeed, during the deportation of Adjutant Lucien Châtelain, sentenced for conspiring with the enemy in 1888, the facilities did not provide the required conditions of confinement and detention conditions were considered too soft. On 21 February 1895, Dreyfus embarked on the ship Ville de Saint-Nazaire. The next day the ship sailed for French Guiana.
On 12 March 1895, after a difficult voyage of fifteen days, the ship anchored off the Îles du Salut. Dreyfus stayed one month in prison on Île Royale and was transferred to Devil&#x27;s Island on 14 April 1895. Apart from his guards, he was the only inhabitant of the island and he stayed in a stone hut . Haunted by the risk of escape, the commandant of the prison sentenced him to a hellish life, even though living conditions were already very painful. The temperature reached 45 °C, he was underfed or fed contaminated food and hardly had any treatment for his many tropical diseases. Dreyfus became sick and shaken by fevers that got worse every year.

Dreyfus was allowed to write on paper numbered and signed. He underwent censorship by the commandant even when he received mail from his wife Lucie, whereby they encouraged each other. On 6 September 1896, the conditions of life for Dreyfus worsened again; he was chained &quot;double looped&quot;, forcing him to stay in bed motionless with his ankles shackled. This measure was the result of false information of his escape revealed by a British newspaper. For two long months, Dreyfus was plunged into deep despair, convinced that his life would end on this remote island.

== The truth emerges (1895–1897) ==

=== The Dreyfus family exposes the affair and takes action ===
Mathieu Dreyfus, the elder brother of Alfred, was convinced of his innocence. He was the chief architect of the rehabilitation of his brother and spent his time, energy and fortune to gather an increasingly powerful movement for a retrial in December 1894, despite the difficulties of the task:

Mathieu tried all paths, even the most fantastic. Thanks to Dr. Gibert, a friend of President Félix Faure, he met at Le Havre a woman who spoke for the first time under hypnosis of a &quot;secret file&quot;. This fact was confirmed by the President of the Republic to Dr. Gibert in a private conversation.

Little by little, despite threats of arrest for complicity, machinations and entrapment by the military, he managed to convince various moderates. Thus the anarchist journalist Bernard Lazare looked into the proceedings. In 1896, Lazare published the first Dreyfusard booklet in Brussels. This publication had little influence on the political and intellectual world, but it contained so much detail that the General Staff suspected that Picquart, the new head of SR, was responsible.

The campaign for the review, relayed little by little into the leftist anti-military press, triggered a return of a violent yet vague antisemitism. France was overwhelmingly anti-Dreyfusard; Major Henry from the Statistics Section in turn was aware of the thinness of the prosecution case. At the request of his superiors, General Boisdeffre, Chief of the General Staff and Major-General Gonse, he was charged with the task of enlarging the file to prevent any attempt at a review. Unable to find any evidence, he decided to build some after the fact. 

=== The discovery of the real culprit: Picquart &quot;going to the enemy&quot; ===

Major Georges Picquart was assigned to be head of the staff of the Military Intelligence Service (SR) in July 1895, following the illness of Colonel Sandherr. In March 1896, Picquart, who had followed the Dreyfus affair from the outset, now required to receive the documents stolen from the German Embassy directly without any intermediary. He discovered a document called the &quot;petit bleu&quot;: a telegram that was never sent, written by von Schwarzkoppen and intercepted at the German Embassy at the beginning of March 1896. It was addressed to a French officer, Major Walsin-Esterhazy, 27 rue de la Bienfaisance – Paris. In another letter in black pencil, von Schwarzkoppen revealed the same clandestine relationship with Esterhazy.

On seeing letters from Esterhazy, Picquart realized with amazement that his writing was exactly the same as that on the &quot;bordereau&quot;, which had been used to incriminate Dreyfus. He procured the &quot;secret file&quot; given to the judges in 1894 and was astonished by the lack of evidence against Dreyfus, and became convinced of his innocence. Moved by his discovery, Picquart diligently conducted an enquiry in secret without the consent of his superiors. The enquiry demonstrated that Esterhazy had knowledge of the elements described by the &quot;bordereau&quot; and that he was in contact with the German Embassy. It was established that the officer sold the Germans many secret documents, whose value was quite low.

Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy was a former member of French counterespionage where he had served after the war of 1870. He had worked in the same office as Major Henry from 1877 to 1880. A man with a personality disorder, a sulphurous reputation and crippled by debt, he was considered by Picquart to be a traitor driven by monetary reasons to betray his country. Picquart communicated the results of his investigation to the General Staff, which opposed him under &quot;the authority of the principle of &quot;res judicata&quot;&quot;. After this, everything was done to oust him from his position, with the help of his own deputy, Major Henry. It was primarily the upper echelons of the Army that did not want to admit that Dreyfus&#x27;s conviction could be a grave miscarriage of justice. For Mercier, then Zurlinden and the General Staff, what was done was done and should never be returned to. They found it convenient to separate the Dreyfus and Esterhazy affairs.

=== The denunciation of Esterhazy and the progress of Dreyfusism ===
The nationalist press launched a violent campaign against the burgeoning Dreyfusards. In counter-attack, the General Staff discovered and revealed the information hitherto ignored in the &quot;secret file&quot;. Doubt began to surface, and figures in the artistic and political spheres asked questions. Picquart tried to convince his seniors to react in favour of Dreyfus, but the General Staff seemed deaf. An investigation was started against him, he was monitored when he was in the east, then transferred to Tunisia &quot;in the interest of the service&quot;.

At this moment Major Henry chose to take action. On 1 November 1896, he created a false document, subsequently called the &quot;faux Henry&quot; [Henry forgery], keeping the header and signature of an ordinary letter from Panizzardi, and wrote the central text himself:

This was a rather crude forgery. Generals Gonse and Boisdeffre, however, without asking questions, brought the letter to their minister, General Jean-Baptiste Billot. The doubts of the General Staff regarding the innocence of Dreyfus flew out the window. With this discovery the General Staff decided to protect Esterhazy and persecute Colonel Picquart, &quot;who did not understand anything&quot;. Picquart, who knew nothing of the &quot;faux Henry&quot;, quickly felt isolated from his fellow soldiers. Major Henry accused Picquart of embezzlement and sent him a letter full of innuendo. He protested in writing and returned to Paris.

Picquart confided in his friend, lawyer Louis Leblois, who promised secrecy. Leblois, however, spoke to the vice president of the Senate, the Alsatian Auguste Scheurer-Kestner (born in Mulhouse, like Dreyfus), who was in turn infected by doubts. Without citing Picquart, the senator revealed the affair to the highest people in the country. The General Staff, however, still suspected Picquart of causing leaks. This was the beginning of the Picquart affair, a new conspiracy by the General Staff against an officer.

Major Henry, although deputy to Picquart, was jealous and fostered his own malicious operation to compromise his superior. He engaged in various malpractices (making a letter and designating it as an instrument of a &quot;Jewish syndicate&quot;, wanting to help Dreyfus to escape, rigging the &quot;petit bleu&quot; to create a belief that Picquart erased the name of the real recipient, drafting a letter naming Dreyfus in full).

Parallel to the investigations of Picquart, the defenders of Dreyfus were informed in November 1897 that the identity of the writer of the &quot;bordereau&quot; was Esterhazy. Mathieu Dreyfus had a reproduction of the bordereau published by &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. A banker, Castro, formally identified the writing as that of Esterhazy, who was his debtor, and told Mathieu. On 11 November 1897, the two paths of investigation met during a meeting between Scheurer-Kestner and Mathieu Dreyfus. The latter finally received confirmation that Esterhazy was the author of the note. Based on this, on 15 November 1897 Mathieu Dreyfus made a complaint to the minister of war against Esterhazy. The controversy was now public and the army had no choice but to open an investigation. At the end of 1897, Picquart returned to Paris and made public his doubts about the guilt of Dreyfus because of his discoveries. Collusion to eliminate Picquart seemed to have failed. The challenge was very strong and turned to confrontation. To discredit Picquart, Esterhazy sent, without effect, letters of complaint to the president of the republic.

The Dreyfusard movement, led by Bernard Lazare, Mathieu Dreyfus, Joseph Reinach and Auguste Scheurer-Kestner gained momentum. Émile Zola, informed in mid-November 1897 by Scheurer-Kestner with documents, was convinced of the innocence of Dreyfus and undertook to engage himself officially. On 25 November 1897 the novelist published &quot;Mr. Scheurer-Kestner&quot; in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, which was the first article in a series of three. Faced with threats of massive cancellations from its readers, the paper&#x27;s editor stopped supporting Zola. Gradually, from late-November through early-December 1897, a number of prominent people got involved in the fight for retrial. These included the authors Octave Mirbeau (his first article was published three days after Zola) and Anatole France, academic Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, the librarian of the &quot;École normale supérieure&quot; Lucien Herr (who convinced Léon Blum and Jean Jaurès), the authors of &quot;La Revue Blanche&quot;, (where Lazare knew the director Thadee Natanson), and the Clemenceau brothers Albert and Georges. Blum tried in late November 1897 to sign, with his friend Maurice Barrès, a petition calling for a retrial, but Barrès refused, broke with Zola and Blum in early-December, and began to popularize the term &quot;intellectuals&quot;. This first break was the prelude to a division among the educated elite after 13 January 1898.

The Dreyfus affair occupied more and more discussions, something the political world did not always recognize. Jules Méline declared in the opening session of the National Assembly on 7 December 1897, &quot;There is no Dreyfus affair. There is not now and there can be no Dreyfus affair.&quot;

=== Trial and acquittal of Esterhazy ===
General Georges-Gabriel de Pellieux was responsible for conducting an investigation. It was brief, thanks to the General Staff&#x27;s skillful manipulation of the investigator. The real culprit, they said, was Lieutenant-Colonel Picquart. The investigation was moving towards a predictable conclusion until Esterhazy&#x27;s former mistress, Madame de Boulancy, published letters in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; in which ten years earlier Esterhazy had expressed violently his hatred for France and his contempt for the French army. The militarist press rushed to the rescue of Esterhazy with an unprecedented antisemitic campaign. The Dreyfusard press replied with strong new evidence in its possession. Georges Clemenceau, in the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot;, asked, &quot;Who protects Major Esterhazy? The law must stop sucking up to this ineffectual Prussian disguised as a French officer. Why? Who trembles before Esterhazy? What occult power, why shamefully oppose the action of justice? What stands in the way? Why is Esterhazy, a character of depravity and more than doubtful morals, protected while the accused is not? Why is an honest soldier such as Lieutenant-Colonel Picquart discredited, overwhelmed, dishonoured? If this is the case we must speak out!&quot;

Although protected by the General Staff and therefore by the government, Esterhazy was obliged to admit authorship of the Francophobe letters published by &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. This convinced the Office of the General Staff to find a way to stop the questions, doubts, and the beginnings of demands for justice. The idea was to require Esterhazy to demand a trial and be acquitted, to stop the noise and allow a return to order. Thus, to finally exonerate him, according to the old rule , Esterhazy was set to appear before a military court on 10 January 1898. A &quot;delayed&quot; closed court trial was pronounced. Esterhazy was notified of the matter on the following day, along with guidance on the defensive line to take. The trial was not normal: the civil trial Mathieu and Lucy Dreyfus requested was denied, and the three handwriting experts decided the writing in the bordereau was not Esterhazy&#x27;s. The accused was applauded and the witnesses booed and jeered. Pellieux intervened to defend the General Staff without legal substance. The real accused was Picquart, who was dishonoured by all the military protagonists of the affair. Esterhazy was acquitted unanimously the next day after just three minutes of deliberation. With all the cheering, it was difficult for Esterhazy to make his way toward the exit, where some 1,500 people were waiting.

By error an innocent person was convicted, but on order the guilty party was acquitted. For many moderate Republicans it was an intolerable infringement of the fundamental values they defended. The acquittal of Esterhazy therefore brought about a change of strategy for the Dreyfusards. Liberalism-friendly Scheurer-Kestner and Reinach, took more combative and rebellious action. In response to the acquittal, large and violent riots by anti-Dreyfusards and antisemites broke out across France.

Flush with victory, the General Staff arrested Picquart on charges of violation of professional secrecy following the disclosure of his investigation through his lawyer, who revealed it to Senator Scheurer-Kestner. The colonel, although placed under arrest at Fort Mont-Valérien, did not give up and involved himself further in the affair. When Mathieu thanked him, he replied curtly that he was &quot;doing his duty&quot;. Esterhazy benefited from special treatment by the upper echelons of the army, which was inexplicable except for the General Staff&#x27;s desire to stifle any inclination to challenge the verdict of the court martial that had convicted Dreyfus in 1894. The army declared Esterhazy unfit for service.

===Esterhazy&#x27;s flight to England and confession===
To avoid personal risk Esterhazy shaved off his prominent moustache and went into exile in England.

Rachel Beer, editor of &quot;The Observer&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, interviewed him twice. He confessed to writing the bordereau under orders from Sandherr in an attempt to frame Dreyfus. She wrote about her interviews in September 1898, reporting his confession and writing a leader column accusing the French military of antisemitism and calling for a retrial for Dreyfus. Esterhazy lived comfortably in England until his death in 1923.

== &quot;J&#x27;Accuse ...!&quot; 1898 ==

=== The Dreyfus affair becomes &quot;The Affair&quot; ===


On 13 January 1898, Émile Zola touched off a new dimension in the Dreyfus affair, which became known simply as &quot;The Affair&quot;. The first great Dreyfusard intellectual, Zola was at the height of his glory: the twenty volumes of the &quot;Les Rougon-Macquart&quot; epic were being distributed in dozens of countries. He was a leader in the literary world and was fully conscious of it. To General Pellieux, he said at his trial, &quot;I ask General Pellieux if there are not many ways to serve France? It can be served by the sword or by the pen. General Pellieux has probably won great victories! I have won mine, too. By my work the French language has been brought into the world. I have my victories! I bequeath to posterity the name of General Pellieux and that of Émile Zola: history will choose!

Outraged by the acquittal of Esterhazy, Zola published a 4,500-word article on the front page of &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot; in the form of an open letter to President Félix Faure (Clemenceau thought up the headline &quot;J&#x27;Accuse...!&quot;). With a typical circulation of 30,000, the newspaper distributed nearly 300,000 copies that day. This article had the effect of an explosion. The article was a direct attack, explicit and clear, and named names. It denounced all those who had conspired against Dreyfus, including the minister of war and the General Staff. The article contained numerous errors, exaggerating or minimizing the roles of one or another of the figures involved (the role of General Mercier was greatly underestimated, for instance).

&quot;J&#x27;Accuse...!&quot; provided for the first time a compilation of all existing data on the affair in one place. Zola&#x27;s goal was to make himself a target, to force the authorities to prosecute him. His trial forced a new public review of both the Dreyfus and Esterhazy affairs. Here he went against the strategy of Scheurer-Kestner and Lazare, who advocated patience and reflection. Thanks to the national and international success of Zola&#x27;s article, a trial became inevitable. From that critical moment the case followed two parallel paths. On one hand, the state used its apparatus to impose a limitation on the trial, restricting it to one of simple libel so as to separate the Dreyfus and Esterhazy cases, which had already been adjudicated. On the other hand, conflicting camps of opinion tried to influence judges and the government—one side pushed to obtain a review and the other to convict Zola. But Zola achieved his aim: the opening of a public debate at the Assize Court.

On 15 January 1898, &quot;Le Temps&quot; published a petition calling for a retrial. It included the names of Émile Zola, Anatole France, director of the Pasteur Institute Émile Duclaux, Daniel Halévy, Fernand Gregh, Félix Fénéon, Marcel Proust, Lucien Herr, Charles Andler, Victor Bérard, François Simiand, Georges Sorel, the painter Claude Monet, the writer Jules Renard, the sociologist Émile Durkheim, and the historian Gabriel Monod.

On 20 January 1898, after an anti-Zola speech by rightist politician Albert de Mun at the Chamber of Deputies, the chamber voted 312–22 to prosecute Zola. On 23 January 1898 Clemenceau, in the name of a &quot;peaceful revolt of the French spirit&quot;, picked up the term &quot;intellectuals&quot; and used it in &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot;, but in a positive sense. On 1 February 1898, Barres lambasted the intellectuals in &quot;Le Journal&quot;. Anti-intellectualism became a major theme of right-wing intellectuals, who accused the Dreyfusards of failing to put the nation&#x27;s interests first, an argument that continued throughout the years that followed and which became the basis of the public debate: a choice between justice and truth on the one hand, and the defense of the nation, preservation of society, and superiority of the state on the other. At first, the political left did not echo this mobilization of intellectuals—on 19 January 1898 Socialist Deputies distanced themselves from the &quot;two rival bourgeois factions&quot;.

=== The trial of Zola ===
General Billot, Minister of War, filed a complaint against Zola and Alexandre Perrenx, the manager of &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot;, to be heard at the Assises of the Seine from 7 to 23 February 1898. Defamation of a public authority was liable to trial in the Cour d&#x27;Assises, while insults to private figures—such as journalists and intellectuals—uttered by the nationalist and antisemitic press were limited to the civil adversarial system. (The taxpayer is at risk in the first case, while only the plaintiff is at risk in the second.) The minister referred to only three passages of Zola&#x27;s article, eighteen lines out of hundreds. He accused Zola of having written that the court martial had committed &quot;unlawful acts ... by order&quot;. The trial opened in an atmosphere of extreme violence—Zola had been the object of &quot;the most shameful attacks&quot; as well as important support and congratulations. (On 2 February, Octave Mirbeau, Laurent Tailhade, Pierre Quillard and Georges Courteline, among others, in &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot; signed an &quot;Address to Émile Zola&quot; assuring him of their support &quot;in the name of justice and truth&quot;.)

Fernand Labori, Zola&#x27;s lawyer, intended to call about 200 witnesses. The details of the Dreyfus affair, unknown to most of the public, were published in the press. Several papers, &quot;Le Siecle&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Áurore&quot; among others, published shorthand notes verbatim of the debates every day to build support in the population. These notes were, for the Dreyfusards, an essential tool for later debates. The nationalists, behind Henri Rochefort, however, were more visible and organized riots, which forced the prefect of police to intervene to protect Zola whenever he left the facility after every hearing.

This trial was also the scene of a real legal battle in which the rights of the defence were constantly violated. Many observers were aware of the collusion between France&#x27;s political and military worlds. Evidently the court received instructions not to raise the subject of former judicial errors. President Delegorgue, on the pretext of the long duration of the hearings, juggled the law incessantly to ensure that the trial dealt only with the alleged defamation by Zola. Delegorgue&#x27;s phrase &quot;the question will not be put&quot; was repeated dozens of times.

Zola was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 3,000 francs, which was the maximum penalty. This harshness was due to the atmosphere of violence surrounding the trial. &quot;The excitement of the audience and the exasperation of the crowd in front of the courthouse were so violent that one could fear the worst excesses if the jury acquitted Mr. Zola&quot;. However, the Zola trial was rather a victory for the Dreyfusards. Indeed, the affair and its contradictions had been widely discussed throughout the trial, especially by the military. In addition, the violent attacks against Zola and the injustice of the conviction of Dreyfus reinforced the commitment of the Dreyfusards. Stéphane Mallarmé declared, &quot;[I am] imbued by the admirable actions [of Zola]&quot; and Jules Renard wrote in his diary: &quot;From tonight I hold on to the Republic that inspires respect in me, a tenderness in me that I do not know. I declare that Justice is the most beautiful word in the language of men and I must cry if men no longer understand it&quot;. Senator Ludovic Trarieux and Catholic jurist Paul Viollet founded the League for the Defence of Human Rights. Even more than the Dreyfus affair the Zola affair resulted in a regrouping of intellectual forces into two opposing camps.

On 2 April 1898, an application to the Supreme Court received a favourable response. This was the court&#x27;s first intervention in the affair. The court upheld the appeal, on the formal grounds that as the alleged libel was against the military court, rather than the minister, it was the military court that should have made the complaint. Prosecutor-General Manau supported a review of the Dreyfus trial and strongly opposed the antisemites. The judges of the military court, whom Zola had challenged, therefore opened a new suit against him for libel. The case was brought before the Assizes of Seine-et-Oise in Versailles where the public was considered more favourable to the army and more nationalistic. On 23 May 1898, at the first hearing, Mr. Labori appealed to the Supreme Court regarding the change of jurisdiction, which adjourned the trial and postponed the hearing to 18 July 1898. Labori advised Zola to leave France for England before the end of the trial, which the writer did, departing for a one-year exile in England. The defendants were convicted again. As for Colonel Picquart, he found himself again in prison.

=== Antisemitic riots ===
Antisemitic disturbances and riots broke out in 1898 in cities across Metropolitan France, mostly in January and February. Antisemitic riots predated the Dreyfus affair, and were almost a tradition in the East, which &quot;the Alsatian people observed upon the outbreak of any revolution in France&quot;. But the 1898 disturbances were much more widespread.

There were three waves of unrest in 55 localities: the first ending the week of 23 January; the second wave in the week following; and the third wave from 23–28 February; these waves and other incidents totaled 69 riots or disturbances across the country. Additionally, riots took place in Algeria from 18–25 January. Demonstrators at these disturbances threw stones, chanted slogans, attacked Jewish property and sometimes Jewish people, and resisted police efforts to stop them. Mayors called for calm, and troops including cavalry were called in an attempt to quell the disturbances.

Zola&#x27;s &quot;J&#x27;Accuse&quot; appeared on 13 January, and most historians suggest that the riots were spontaneous reactions to its publication, and to the subsequent Zola trial. The press reported that &quot;tumultuous demonstrations broke out nearly every day&quot;. Prefects or police in various towns noted demonstrations in their localities, and associated them with &quot;the campaign undertaken in favor of ex-Captain Dreyfus&quot;, or with the &quot;intervention by M. Zola&quot;, or the Zola trial itself, which &quot;seems to have aroused the antisemitic demonstrations&quot;. In Paris, demonstrations around the Zola trial were frequent and sometimes violent. Roger Martin du Gard reported that &quot;Individuals with Jewish features were grabbed, surrounded, and roughed up by delirious youths who danced round them, brandishing flaming torches, made from rolled-up copies of &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot;.

However, the fervid reaction to the Dreyfus affair and especially the Zola trial was only partly spontaneous. In a dozen cities including Nantes, Lille, and Le Havre, antisemitic posters appeared in the streets, and riots followed soon after. At Saint-Etienne, posters read, &quot;Imitate your brothers of Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Nantes, Toulouse ... join with them in demonstrating against the underhand attacks being made on the Nation.&quot; In Caen, Marseille, and other cities, riots followed antisemitic speeches or meetings, such as the meeting organized by the &quot;Comité de Défense Religieuse et Sociale&quot; in Caen.

=== Henry unmasked, the case is rekindled ===
The acquittal of Esterhazy, the convictions of Émile Zola and of Georges Picquart, and the continued presence of an innocent man in prison had a considerable national and international effect. France was exposed as an arbitrary state, which contradicted its founding republican principles. Antisemitism made considerable progress and riots were common throughout the year 1898. However politicians were still in denial about the affair. In April and May 1898, they were mostly concerned with elections, in which Jaurès lost his seat of Carmaux. The majority was moderate, though a parliamentary group in the House was antisemitic. Nevertheless the cause of the Dreyfusards was restarted.

Godefroy Cavaignac, the new minister of war and a fierce supporter of anti-revisionism, definitely wanted to prove the guilt of Dreyfus and from there &quot;wring the neck&quot; of Esterhazy, whom he considered &quot;a pathological liar and blackmailer&quot;. He was absolutely convinced of Dreyfus&#x27;s guilt, a conviction reinforced by the legend of the confession (after meeting the main witness, Captain Lebrun-Renault). Cavaignac had the honesty of a doctrinaire intransigent, but absolutely did not know the depths of the affair—the General Staff had kept him in the dark. He was surprised to learn that all the documents on which the prosecution was based had not been expertly appraised and that Boisdeffre had &quot;absolute confidence&quot; in Henry. Cavaignac decided to investigate—in his office, with his assistants—and retrieved the secret file, which now contained 365 items.

On 4 April, the newspaper &quot;Le Siècle&quot; published &quot;Lettre d&#x27;un Diplomate&quot;, the first of four documents, that were of critical importance in exposing Esterhazy&#x27;s guilt, and enabled the Dreyfusard cause to regain the initiative it had lost with Zola&#x27;s conviction. The secret information had been provided by Zola, who had received it from Oscar Wilde; Wilde had gained it from best friend Carlos Blacker, who was an intimate friend of Alessandro Panizzardi.
On 7 July 1898, during a questioning in the National Assembly Cavaignac reported three items &quot;overwhelming among a thousand&quot;, two of which had no connection with the case. The other was the &quot;faux Henry&quot;. Cavaignac&#x27;s speech was effective: the &quot;députés&quot; (deputies) gave him an ovation and voted to display copies of the three documents in the 36,000 communes of France. The anti-Dreyfusards had triumphed, but Cavaignac implicitly recognized that the Dreyfus&#x27;s defence had not had access to all the evidence. The application for annulment made by Lucie Dreyfus became admissible. The next day, Picquart declared in &quot;Le Temps&quot; to the council president, &quot;I am in a position to establish before a court of competent jurisdiction that the two documents bearing the date of 1894 could not be attributed to Dreyfus and that the one that bears the date of 1896 had all the characteristics of a fake&quot;, which earned him eleven months in prison.

On the evening of 13 August 1898, Louis Cuignet, who was attached to the cabinet of Cavaignac, was working by the light of a lamp and observed that the colour of the lines on the &quot;faux Henry&quot; paper header and footer did not correspond with the central part of the document. Cavaignac was still trying to find logical reasons for the guilt and conviction of Dreyfus but was not silent on this discovery. A board of inquiry was formed to investigate Esterhazy, before which he panicked and confessed his secret reports to Major du Paty de Clam. Collusion between the General Staff and the traitor was revealed. On 30 August 1898 Cavaignac resigned himself to demanding explanations from Colonel Henry in the presence of Boisdeffre and Gonse. After an hour of questioning by the minister himself, Henry broke down and made a full confession. He was placed under arrest at the Mont-Valérien fortress, where he killed himself the next day by cutting his own throat with a razor. The request for review filed by Lucie Dreyfus could not be rejected. Yet Cavaignac said &quot;less than ever!&quot;, but the president of the council, Henri Brisson, forced him to resign. Despite his apparently entirely involuntary role in the revision of the 1894 trial Cavaignac remained convinced that Dreyfus was guilty and made a statement disparaging and offensive to Dreyfus at the Rennes trial.
The anti-revisionists did not consider themselves beaten. On 6 September 1898 Charles Maurras published a eulogy of Henry in &quot;La Gazette de France&quot; in which he called him a &quot;heroic servant of the great interests of the State&quot;. &quot;La Libre Parole&quot;, Drumont&#x27;s antisemitic newspaper, spread the notion of &quot;patriotic fake&quot; (&quot;faux patriotique&quot;). In December the same newspaper launched a subscription, in favour of his widow, to erect a monument to Henry. Each gift was accompanied by pithy, often abusive, remarks on Dreyfus, the Dreyfusards, and the Jews. Some 14,000 subscribers, including 53 deputies, sent 131,000 francs. On 3 September 1898, Brisson, the president of the council, urged Mathieu Dreyfus to file an application for review of the military court of 1894. The government transferred the case to the Supreme Court for its opinion on the past four years of proceedings.

France was thoroughly divided into two, but several things remain clear: the Jewish community had little involvement, intellectuals were not all Dreyfusards, the Protestants were divided, and Marxists refused to support Dreyfus. The split transcended religion and social background, as shown in a cartoon by Caran d&#x27;Ache, &quot;A Family Dinner&quot;: before, &quot;Above all, never talk about it!&quot;; after, &quot;They talked about it&quot;.

=== Crisis and reshaping the political landscape ===

Henry was dead, Boisdeffre had resigned, Gonse had no more authority, and du Paty had been severely compromised by Esterhazy: for the conspirators it was a débâcle. The government was now caught between two fires: the nationalist pressure on the street and the higher command. Cavaignac, having resigned for continuing to spread his anti-Dreyfusard vision of the affair, arose as an anti-revisionist leader. General Zurlinden who succeeded him and was influenced by the General Staff, delivered a negative opinion at the review on 10 September 1898 comforting the extremist press by saying that, &quot;a review means war&quot;. The obstinacy of the government, who voted to revert to the Supreme Court on 26 September 1898, led to the resignation of Zurlinden who was soon replaced by General Chanoine. When Chanoine was questioned in the House he handed in his resignation; trust was denied to Brisson and he was also forced to resign. Ministerial instability caused some governmental instability.

On 1 November 1898, the Progressive Charles Dupuy was appointed in place of Brisson. In 1894 he had covered the actions of General Mercier at the beginning of the Dreyfus affair, and four years later he announced that he would follow the judgment of the Supreme Court, thus blocking the road for those who wanted to stifle the review and divest the Court. On 5 December 1898 in the shadow of a debate in the House on the transmission of the &quot;secret file&quot; to the Supreme Court the tension rose another notch. Insults, invective, and other nationalistic violence gave way to threats of an uprising. Paul Déroulède declared: &quot;If there has to be a civil war so be it.&quot;

A new crisis arose at the same time in the heart of the Supreme Court, since Quesnay de Beaurepaire, president of the Civil Chamber, accused the Criminal Chamber of Dreyfusism in the press. He resigned on 8 January 1899 as a hero of the nationalist cause. This crisis led to the divestiture of the Criminal Division in favour of joint chambers. This was the point of blockage for the review.

In 1899, the Dreyfus affair took up more and more of the political scene. On 16 February 1899, Félix Faure, the President of France, died of a heart attack. Émile Loubet was elected, which was an advance for the cause of the review as the previous president had been a fierce opponent. On 23 February 1899 at the funeral for Faure, Paul Déroulède attempted to force a coup at the Élysée Palace. It was a failure as it was not supported by the military. On 4 June 1899 Loubet was assaulted at the Longchamp Racecourse. These provocations plus permanent demonstrations from the extreme right, although it never actually put the Republic in danger, created a burst of Republicanism leading to the formation of a &quot;government of republican defence&quot; around Waldeck-Rousseau on 22 June 1899. The center of French politics, including Raymond Poincaré, had aligned itself with the pro-revisionists. The progressive anti-Dreyfusard Republicans such as Jules Méline, were rejected outright. The Dreyfus affair led to a clear reorganization of the French political landscape.

=== The appeal on the judgment of 1894 ===
The Supreme Court considered the Dreyfus affair in the context of press campaigns against the Criminal Division, the magistrates being constantly dragged through the mud in nationalist newspapers from the Panama scandals. On 26 September 1898, after a Cabinet vote, the Minister of Justice appealed to the Supreme Court. On 29 October 1898, after the submission of the report from the recorder Alphonse Bard, the Criminal Chamber of the Court stated that &quot;the application is admissible and will proceed with a supplementary investigation&quot;.

The recorder Louis Loew presided. He was subjected to a very violent campaign of antisemitic insults due to his being an Alsatian Protestant accused of being a deserter and tainted by the Prussians. Despite the compliant silence of Mercier, Billot, Zurlinden, and Roget, who hid behind the authority of &quot;already judged&quot; and &quot;state secret&quot;, understanding of the affair increased. Cavaignac made a statement two days long, but failed to prove the guilt of Dreyfus. On the contrary, he unwittingly exonerated him by a demonstration of the exact date of the bordereau (August 1894).

Picquart then demonstrated all the workings of the error, then the conspiracy. In a decision dated 8 December 1898 in response to his divestiture announcement, Picquart was protected from the military court by the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court. This was a new obstacle to the wishes of the General Staff. A new furiously antisemitic press campaign burst during the event, while &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot; on 29 October 1898 published an article entitled &quot;Victory&quot; in the same character as &quot;J&#x27;accuse...!&quot; The work of the investigation was still to be taken back by the Criminal Division. The &quot;secret file&quot; was analyzed from 30 December 1898 and the Criminal Division requested disclosure of diplomatic records, which was granted.

On 9 February 1899, the Criminal Division submitted its report by highlighting two important facts: it was certain Esterhazy used the same paper as the bordereau and the secret file was completely void. These two major events alone destroyed all proceedings against Alfred Dreyfus. In parallel, President Mazeau conducted an inquiry by the Criminal Division, which led to divestiture thereof &quot;to not only leave it to bear alone all responsibility for the final decision&quot;, so protecting the Criminal Division from actions arising from its report.

On 28 February 1899, Waldeck-Rousseau spoke to the Senate on the floor and denounced &quot;moral conspiracy&quot; within the government and in the street. The review was no longer avoidable. On 1 March 1899, Alexis Ballot-Beaupré, the new president of the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court, was appointed recorder for the consideration of the application for review. He took on the legal files and decided on a further investigation. Ten additional witnesses were interviewed, which further weakened the version of the General Staff. In the final discussion, President Ballot-Beaupré demonstrated the inanity of the bordereau, which was the only evidence against Dreyfus. The prosecutor Manau echoed the views of the President. Mornard who represented Lucie Dreyfus argued without any difficulty or opposition from the prosecution.

On 3 June 1899, the joint chambers of the Supreme Court overturned the judgment of 1894 in a formal hearing. The case was referred to the Military Court of Rennes. By that judgment, the Supreme Court imposed itself as an absolute authority capable of standing up to military and political power. For many Dreyfusards, this ruling was the prelude to the acquittal of the captain; they forgot to consider that it was again the army who would judge. The court, in overturning the judgement, believed in the legal autonomy of the military court without taking into account the laws of &quot;esprit de corps&quot;.

===Fear of boycott===
Hannah Arendt writes that fear of an international boycott of the Paris Exposition of 1900 was what &quot;united the disrupted country, turned parliament in favor of a retrial and eventually reconciled disparate elements&quot; of France in a way &quot;Clemenceau&#x27;s daily editorials, Zola&#x27;s pathos, Jaurès&#x27; speeches and popular hatred of the clergy and aristocracy&quot; had not.

== The trial in Rennes 1899 ==

=== Conduct of the trial ===
Alfred Dreyfus was in no way aware of what was happening thousands of kilometres from him. Neither was he aware of the schemes hatched to guarantee that he could never return, or the commitment of countless men and women to his cause. The prison administration filtered information deemed confidential. At the end of 1898, he learned with astonishment the actual size of the affair, about which he knew nothing: the accusation by his brother against Esterhazy, the acquittal of the traitor, Henry&#x27;s confession and suicide, and the reading of the record of investigations of the Supreme Court, which he received two months after its publication. On 5 June 1899, Alfred Dreyfus was notified of the decision of the Supreme Court on the judgment of 1894. On 9 June 1899, he left Devil&#x27;s Island, heading to France, but locked in a cabin as if guilty, even though he no longer was. He disembarked on 30 June 1899 in Port Haliguen on the Quiberon peninsula in the greatest secrecy, &quot;a clandestine and nocturnal return&quot;. After five years of imprisonment, he was on his native soil, but he was immediately locked up from 1 July 1899 in the military prison in Rennes. He was remanded on 7 August 1899 before the military court of the Breton capital.

General Mercier, champion of the anti-Dreyfusards, intervened constantly in the press to confirm the accuracy of the first judgement: Dreyfus was surely guilty. Immediately, however, dissent emerged in the defence of Dreyfus. His two lawyers actually had opposing strategies. Demange wanted to stand on the defensive and just get the acquittal of Dreyfus. Labori, a brilliant lawyer who was just 35 years old, wanted to take the offensive, to aim higher and defeat and publicly humiliate the General Staff. Mathieu Dreyfus imagined a complementarity between the two lawyers. The conduct of the trial revealed the disunity that served the prosecution with a defence so impaired.

The trial opened on 7 August 1899 in an atmosphere of extreme tension. Rennes was in a state of siege. The judges of the court-martial were under pressure. Esterházy, who admitted authorship of the bordereau, was in exile in England. He and du Paty were both excused. On the appearance of Dreyfus, emotions ran high. His physical appearance disturbed his supporters and some of his opponents. Despite his deteriorated physical condition, he had a complete mastery of the files acquired in only a few weeks. All the General Staff testified against Dreyfus without providing any proof. They stubbornly considered null and void the confessions of Henry and Esterhazy. The trial even tended to go out of control to the extent that the decisions of the Supreme Court were not taken into account. They discussed in particular the bordereau, which was the proof of guilt of Esterhazy. Nevertheless Mercier was booed at the end of the hearing. The nationalist press and the anti-Dreyfusards could only speculate on his silence about the &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; (the pseudo-note annotated by Emperor Wilhelm II, which nobody will ever see in evidence) that he had not ceased to report before the trial.

On 14 August 1899, Labori was on his way to court when he was shot in the back by an extremist who escaped and was never found. The lawyer was missing from discussions for over a week at the decisive moment of the examination of witnesses. On 22 August 1899, his condition had improved and he returned. Incidents between the two lawyers for Dreyfus multiplied. Labori reproached Demange about his excessive caution. The government, in the face of the military hardening stance, still had two ways to influence events: call for testimony from Germany or abandon the charge. These negotiations in the background, however, had no result. The German Embassy sent a polite refusal to the government. The Minister of War, General Gaston de Galliffet, sent respectful word to Major Louis Carrière, the government commissioner. He asked him to act in the spirit of the revised judgment of the Supreme Court. The officer pretended not to understand the allusion and helped the nationalist lawyer Auffray to make the indictment against Dreyfus. The defence needed to make a decision because the outcome of the case looked bad, despite evidence of the absence of charges against the accused. On behalf of the president of the council, Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, aided by Zola and Jaurès, Labori was convinced to give up his argument so as not to offend the military. They decided to risk conciliation in exchange for the acquittal that seemed to be promised by the government. Mr. Demange, alone and without illusions, continued the defence of Dreyfus in an atmosphere of civil war. In Paris, the antisemitic and nationalist agitators of Auteuil were arrested. Jules Guérin and those who fled and holed up in Fort Chabrol were assaulted by the police.

=== New conviction ===

On 9 September 1899, the court rendered its verdict: Dreyfus was convicted of treason, but &quot;with extenuating circumstances&quot; (by five votes to two) and sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment and a further degradation. Contrary to appearances, this verdict was on the verge of acquittal by one vote. The Code of Military Justice adopted the principle that a minority vote of three against four was an acquittal.

The day after the verdict, Alfred Dreyfus, after much hesitation, filed an appeal for a retrial. Waldeck-Rousseau, in a difficult position, tackled for the first time the possibility of a pardon. Dreyfus had to accept guilt. Exhausted, having been away from his family for too long, he accepted. The decree was signed by President Émile Loubet on 19 September 1899 and Dreyfus was released on 21 September 1899. Many Dreyfusards were frustrated by this final act. Public opinion welcomed this conclusion indifferently. France wanted civil peace and harmony on the eve of the Universal Exhibition of 1900 and before the big fight that the Republic was about to take for freedom of association and secularism.

It was in this spirit that on 17 November 1899, Waldeck-Rousseau filed an amnesty law covering &quot;all criminal acts or misdemeanours related to the Dreyfus affair or that have been included in a prosecution for one of these acts&quot; excluding only Alfred Dreyfus himself who was instead pardoned to be able to still seek acquittal. Many Dreyfusards protested as this indemnified not only Zola and Picquart against (further) punishment but also protected the real culprits. Despite these massive protests the bill was passed.

=== Reactions ===
Reactions in France were strong, consisting of &quot;shock and sadness&quot; in the revisionist camp. Still other reactions tended to show that the &quot;verdict of appeasement&quot; made by the judges was understood and accepted by the population. The Republicans sought above all social peace and to turn the page on this extremely long and controversial affair. Also there were very few demonstrations in the provinces while agitation persisted somewhat in Paris. In the military world appeasement was also essential. Two of the seven judges voted for acquittal. They refused to yield to the implied military order. This was also clearly seen. In an apostrophe for the army, Galliffet announced: &quot;The incident is closed&quot;.

Anti-French demonstrations took place in twenty foreign capitals and the press was outraged. Reactions were twofold. Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg cancelled his concerts in France in protest. The British, as legalists, focused on espionage and challenged rather strongly this conviction devoid of positive arguments in its construction. As such the report of the Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Russell of Killowen, on 16 September 1899, was a symbol of the global effect of the affair in the United Kingdom. Russell, who went as an observer to Rennes, criticised the weaknesses of the Military Court:

In Germany and Italy, the two countries widely challenged by lawsuits against Dreyfus, there was relief. Even if the German Emperor regretted that the innocence of Dreyfus was not recognized, the normalization of future Franco-German relations was seen as a welcome relaxation. Diplomacy between the three powers with the help of England sought to relax in an atmosphere that deteriorated again on the eve of the First World War.

This judicial conclusion also had an unfortunate consequence for the relationship between the Dreyfus family and the branch of Ultra-Dreyfusards. Fernand Labori, Jaures, and Clemenceau, with the consent of Picquart openly accused Alfred Dreyfus of accepting the pardon and only gently protesting the amnesty law.

== Rehabilitation, 1900–1906 ==
Preferring to avoid a third trial the government decided to pardon Dreyfus by a decree signed by President Émile Loubet on 19 September 1899 after much hesitation. Dreyfus was not found innocent. The rehabilitation process was not completed until six years later, when passions had cooled. Many books appeared during this period. In addition to the memoires of Alfred Dreyfus, Reinach published his &quot;History of the Dreyfus Affair&quot; and Jaurès published &quot;The Proofs&quot;. As for Zola, he wrote the third of his &quot;Gospels: Truth&quot;. Even Esterhazy took advantage of his secrets and sold several different versions of the text of his statement to the consul of France.

=== Death of Zola ===
On 29 September 1902, Zola, who was the initiator of &quot;The Affair&quot; and the first of the intellectual Dreyfusards, died, asphyxiated by fumes from his chimney. His wife, Alexandrine, narrowly escaped. It was a shock for the Dreyfusard clan. Anatole France, who demanded that Dreyfus be present at the funeral while the Chief of Police wanted his absence &quot;to avoid problems&quot;, read his funeral oration for the author of &quot;&quot;J&#x27;accuse...!&quot;

In 1953, the newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; published a death-bed confession by a Parisian roofer that he had murdered Zola by blocking the chimney of his house.

=== The semi-rehabilitation ===

==== Legal rehabilitation ====
The elections of 1902 saw the victory of the left. Jean Jaurès was re-elected and he revived the affair on 7 April 1903 while France thought the affair buried forever. In a speech Jaurès evoked the long list of falsehoods peppering the Dreyfus case, and placed particular emphasis on two things. First, the letter of resignation from Pellieux, which was worded in very harsh terms. Legally, it formed an admission of the collusion of the General Staff:

[It] dupes people without honour [and] can no longer rely on the trust of subordinates, without which command is impossible. For my side I can not trust any of my chiefs who have been working on falsehoods, I ask for my retirement.
In addition, the note allegedly annotated (by Kaiser Wilhelm II), which General Mercier had alluded to at the Rennes trial, which is reported by the press to have influenced the judges of the Military Court.

Given these developments, General Louis André, the new Minister of War, led an investigation at the instigation of Émile Combes and assisted by judges. The investigation was conducted by Captain Antoine Louis Targe, aide to the minister. During searches of the Statistics Section he discovered numerous documents, most of which were obviously fabricated. In November 1903 a report was submitted to the Minister of Justice by the Minister of War. This was in compliance with the regulations since the Minister found an error committed by the Military Court. This was the beginning of a new review led by lawyer Ludovic Trarieux, the founder of the League of Human Rights, with a thorough investigation to run over two years. The years 1904 and 1905 were devoted to different legal phases before the Court of Cassation. The court identified three events (grounds) for review, the demonstration of the falsification of the Panizzardi telegram, demonstration of a date change on a document in the 1894 trial (April 1895 changed to April 1894) and demonstration of the fact that Dreyfus had not removed the minutes related to heavy artillery in the army.
With regard to the writing of the bordereau, the court was particularly severe against Alphonse Bertillon who &quot;reasoned badly on forged documents&quot;. The report showed that the writing was certainly by Esterhazy and that the latter had also confessed subsequently. Finally the Court demonstrated by a comprehensive and skilled analysis of the bordereau the futility of this purely intellectual construction and a commission of four headed by a general of artillery, General Sebert, maintained &quot;it is highly unlikely that an artillery officer could write this missive&quot;.

On 9 March 1905, Attorney-General Baudouin delivered an 800-page report in which he demanded the convictions be quashed without further reference to another court and denounced the army. He began a divestiture of the military justice system, which did not conclude until 1982. It was not until 12 July 1906 that the Court of Cassation unanimously cancelled the judgment without reference to the military trial at Rennes in 1899 and pronounced &quot;the end of the rehabilitation of Captain Dreyfus&quot;. The anti-Dreyfusards protested at this hasty rehabilitation. The goal was obviously political: it was to finish and finally turn the page. Nothing could dent the conviction of the opponents of Dreyfus. This method was the most direct and most definitive. What was annulled not only put a stop to Rennes, but the entire chain of prior acts, beginning with the arraignment order given by General Saussier in 1894. The Court focused on the legal aspects only and observed that Dreyfus did not have a duty to be returned before a Military Court for the simple reason that it should never have taken place due to the total absence of charges:

Whereas in the final analysis of the accusation against Dreyfus nothing remains standing and setting aside the judgment of the Military Court leaves nothing that can be considered to be a crime or misdemeanour; therefore by applying the final paragraph of Article 445 no reference to another court should be pronounced.

==== Subsequent career ====
Dreyfus was reinstated in the army with the rank of artillery major by law on 13 July 1906. This reflected the rank to which he could reasonably have been expected to have risen had his career not been interrupted by the false charges against him. However, Dreyfus and his supporters were disappointed that his five years of imprisonment were not taken into account for the reconstruction of his career and that his promotion to major was back-dated only to 10 July 1903. This decision blocked any hope of a career worthy of his past successes before his arrest in 1894. After serving for a year as commander of the artillery depot at Fort Neuf de Vincennes, Major Dreyfus retired in June 1907; a decision taken in part because of recurrent tropical fevers and chronic fatigue arising from the strain of his imprisonment.

On 4 June 1908, on the occasion of the transfer of the ashes of Émile Zola to the Pantheon, Alfred Dreyfus was the target of an attack. Louis Grégori, an extreme right-wing journalist and assistant of Drumont, fired two shots from a revolver and wounded Dreyfus slightly in the arm. He was driven to do this for &quot;Action Française&quot; (French Action) not only to disrupt the ceremony for the &quot;two traitors&quot; Zola and Dreyfus, but also to remake the Dreyfus trial through a new trial, a revenge of some sort. The trial was at the Assises of the Seine, where Grégori was acquitted – the latest in a long series of judicial misconducts. It was an occasion for new antisemitic riots that the government suppressed half-heartedly.

As a reserve officer, Dreyfus participated in the First World War of 1914–1918, serving as head of the artillery depot at a fortified camp near Paris and commander of a supply column. In 1917 he saw frontline service at the Chemin des Dames and Verdun. Apart from Major Du Paty de Clam, Dreyfus was the only officer directly involved in the affair to serve in the war. Having been named as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour at the time of his reinstatement in 1906, Dreyfus was promoted to the rank of officer of the Legion of Honour in 1919. His son, Pierre Dreyfus, also served in World War I as an artillery officer and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. Alfred Dreyfus&#x27;s two nephews also fought as artillery officers in the French Army and both were killed. The same artillery piece (the Obusier de 120 mm C modèle 1890), the secrets of which Dreyfus was accused of revealing to the Germans, was among those used in blunting the early German offensives. He ended his military career as a colonel.

Dreyfus died on 12 July 1935 at the age of seventy-five. His funeral cortège passed through ranks assembled for Bastille Day celebrations at the Place de la Concorde and he was buried in Montparnasse Cemetery. Colonel Picquart was also officially rehabilitated and reintegrated into the army with the rank of Brigadier general. Picquart was Minister of War from 1906 to 1909 in the first Clemenceau government; he died in January 1914 in a horse riding accident.

On July 21, 1935, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a feature by Walter Littlefield headlined &quot;Dreyfus Unaware to End He Had Been Victim of Plot…&quot; The piece fills 2 full pages and leads with the statement that the truth could not be published during Dreyfus&#x27; lifetime &quot;because while he lived this would have caused him pain and resentment.&quot;

== Consequences of the Dreyfus affair ==
For some the Dreyfus affair marked French society as a tortured society. All sections of society were affected; some were devastated. According to Katrin Schultheiss, a modern historian:
The enduring significance of the Dreyfus Affair ... lies in its manifest embodiment of multiple narratives and multiple strands of historical causality. It shows how longstanding beliefs and tensions can be transformed ... into a juggernaut that alters the political and cultural landscape for decades. In the interest of increasing our understanding ... the complexities of that transformation should be recognized and analyzed rather than packaged for moral or political usefulness.

=== Political consequences ===

The Dreyfus affair brought the confrontation between two sides of France to life. However, according to most historians, this opposition served the republican order. There was indeed a strengthening of parliamentary democracy and a failure of monarchist and reactionary forces.

The excessive violence of the nationalist parties brought together republicans in a united front, which defeated attempts to return to the &quot;old order&quot;. In the short term, progressive political forces from the elections of 1893 and confirmed in 1898 as a result of the Dreyfus affair disappeared in 1899. The shock trials of Esterhazy and Zola created a dreyfusian politics whose aim was to develop a republican consciousness and to fight against authoritarian nationalism, which expressed itself during the affair. For the uninhibited growth of populist nationalism was another major result of the event in French politics even though it did not originate from the Dreyfus affair. It grew out of the Boulanger affair, 1886–1889, and was shaped into a coherent theory by Maurice Barrès in 1892. Nationalism had its ups and downs, but managed to maintain itself as a political force under the name of &quot;Action Française&quot;, among others. On that occasion many republicans rallied to Vichy, without which the operation of the State would have been precarious, which showed the fragility of the republican institution in extreme circumstances. Upon liberation, Charles Maurras who was convicted on 25 January 1945 for acts of collaboration exclaimed at the verdict: &quot;This is the revenge of Dreyfus!&quot;

The other result was an intellectual mutation of socialism. Jaurès was a late Dreyfusard (January 1898) and was persuaded by revolutionary socialists. His commitment became unwavering alongside Georges Clemenceau and from 1899 under the influence of Lucien Herr. The year 1902 saw the birth of two parties: the French Socialist Party, which brought together jaurésiens; and the Socialist Party of France under the influence of Guesde and Vaillant. Both parties merged in 1905 as the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO).

In addition, 1901 saw the birth of the Republican Radical and Radical-Socialist Party, the first modern political party, conceived as an electoral machine of the republican group. It had a permanent structure and relied on networks of Dreyfusards. The creation of the &quot;French League for Human Rights&quot; was contemporaneous with the affair. It was the hub of the intellectual left and extremely active at the beginning of the century, the conscience of the humanist left.

The final consequence on the political scene at the turn of the century saw a profound renewal of political personalities with the disappearance of great republican figures beginning with Auguste Scheurer-Kestner. Those who at the end of the century could weigh heavily on the events of the affair had now disappeared giving way to new men whose ambition was to reform and correct the errors and injustices of the past.

The Dreyfus affair created difficulties and blocked the way for improved relations between France and Italy after the customs war as Italy was Europe&#x27;s most Dreyfusard nation.

=== Social consequences ===
Socially, antisemitism was prominent. Existing prior to the Dreyfus affair, it had expressed itself during the Boulangisme affair and the Panama scandals but was limited to an intellectual elite. The Dreyfus affair spread hatred of Jews through all strata of society, a movement that certainly began with the success of &quot;Jewish France&quot; by Édouard Drumont in 1886. It was then greatly amplified by various legal episodes and press campaigns for nearly fifteen years. Antisemitism was from then on official and was espoused in numerous settings including the working classes. Candidates for the legislative elections took advantage of antisemitism as a watchword in parliamentary elections. This antisemitism was reinforced by the crisis of the separation of church and state in 1905, which probably led to its height in France. Antisemitic actions were permitted on the advent of the Vichy regime, which allowed free and unrestrained expression of racial hatred.

Another social consequence was the enhanced role of the press. For the first time it exerted an important influence on French political life. It was possible to speak of a fourth estate since it could act the part of all state organs. Especially as the high editorial quality of the press was mainly derived from the work of writers and novelists who used newspapers as a revolutionary way of expression. The power of the press certainly brought politicians to action, an example of which was Mercier, who appeared to have pushed at the Dreyfus trial in 1894 to please &quot;La Libre Parole&quot; who attacked ferociously. This being said the role of the press was limited by the size of circulation, influential in Paris but to a lesser extent nationwide. The entire run of the national press appeared to revolve around four and a half million copies whose real influence was relatively strong. There was also assistance through the publication in 1899 of a specific newspaper intended to coordinate the fight (in the dreyfusard camp), with the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; of Sébastien Faure.

=== Zionism ===
The shock of the Dreyfus affair also affected the Zionist movement &quot;which found fertile ground for its emergence&quot;.

The Austro-Hungarian journalist Theodor Herzl appeared profoundly moved by the Dreyfus affair, which followed his debut as a correspondent for the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; of Vienna and was present at the degradation of Dreyfus in 1895. &quot;The catalyst for Herzl&#x27;s &#x27;conversion&#x27; is usually seen as the Dreyfus affair, which made him realise the impossibility of Jewish existence in Europe&quot;, although some scholars believe that Herzl may have exaggerated the influence that the Dreyfus affair had on him. Before the wave of antisemitism that accompanied the degradation Herzl was &quot;convinced of the need to resolve the Jewish question&quot;, which became &quot;an obsession for him&quot;. In &quot;Der Judenstaat&quot; (State of the Jews), he considered that:
Herzl&#x27;s shock was great, for, having lived his youth in Austria, an antisemitic country, he chose to live in France for its humanist image, which made it appear a shelter from extremist excess. He had originally been a fanatic supporter for assimilation of Jews into European Gentile society. The Dreyfus affair shook Herzl&#x27;s view on the world, and he became completely enveloped in a tiny movement calling for the restoration of a Jewish State within the biblical homeland in the Land of Israel. Herzl quickly took charge in leading the movement.

He organized on 29 August 1897, the First Zionist Congress in Basel and is considered the &quot;inventor of Zionism as a real political movement&quot;. Theodor Herzl wrote in his diary (1 September 1897):

The Dreyfus affair also marked a turning point in the lives of many Jews from Western and Central Europe, as the pogroms of 1881–1882 had done for the Jews of Eastern Europe, as many Jews had believed that they were Frenchmen first. Yet Jews, despite the state-sanctioned efforts of the emancipation movement, were never truly accepted into society and were often deemed aliens and outsiders, even when they showed extreme devotion by fighting courageously in the wars of their respective countries.

===21st century aftermath===
In October 2021, French President Emmanuel Macron opened a museum dedicated to the Dreyfus affair in Zola&#x27;s former home in Médan in the northwestern suburbs of Paris. He said that nothing could repair the humiliations and injustices Dreyfus had suffered, and &quot;let us not aggravate it by forgetting, deepening or repeating them&quot;.

The reference to not repeating them follows attempts by the French far right to question Dreyfus&#x27;s innocence. An army colonel was cashiered in 1994 for publishing an article suggesting that Dreyfus was guilty; far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s lawyer responded that Dreyfus&#x27;s exoneration was &quot;contrary to all known jurisprudence&quot;. Éric Zemmour, a far-right political opponent of Macron who had said that France&#x27;s Second World War collaborationist leader Philippe Pétain, who had assisted deportation of French Jews to Nazi death camps, had, in certain cases, saved their lives, said repeatedly in 2021 that the truth about Dreyfus was not clear, his innocence was &quot;not obvious&quot;.

Though Alfred Dreyfus was eventually exonerated of all charges, the scandal and its aftermath had lasting repercussions in French society. In the 21st century, the Dreyfus affair remains an important part of French history and has been the focus of much public debate. The controversy has been used to frame discussion on issues such as immigration, religious freedom, minority rights, and the French Republic itself. In recent years, the Dreyfus affair has also been used to draw attention to the resurgence of antisemitism in Europe, and to advocate for legislation that would protect minority rights across the continent. In recent years, there has been a significant push to create legislation to protect minority rights throughout Europe, with the Dreyfus affair serving as an important reference point. In France, lawmakers have proposed a number of bills that would extend protections to minority communities, such as prohibiting discrimination based on ethnicity or religion, and providing additional resources for victims of hate crimes. On a broader European level, the European Union has implemented a variety of measures, such as a hate crime reporting system and a program of positive discrimination to ensure that minority communities are not disproportionately affected by social and economic policies. Additionally, the European Commission has set up a coordinating body to ensure that member states are upholding their obligations to protect minority rights.

=== Commission of sculpture ===

In 1985, President François Mitterrand commissioned a statue of Dreyfus by sculptor Louis Mitelberg. It was to be installed at the École Militaire but the Minister of Defense Charles Hernu refused to display it there. Hernu claimed that this was because the École Militaire is not open to the public, but it was widely believed that this was done to avoid provoking the army. Mitterrand did not override his minister and the statue was instead installed at Boulevard Raspail, No. 116–118 at the exit of the Notre-Dame-des-Champs metro station, where it can be found today. A replica is located at the entrance of Paris&#x27;s Museum of Jewish Art and History, which houses the &quot;Fonds Alfred Dreyfus&quot; of over 2500 historical documents donated by the grandchildren of Captain Dreyfus.

=== Centennial commemoration ===
On 12 July 2006, President Jacques Chirac held an official state ceremony marking the centenary of Dreyfus&#x27;s official rehabilitation. This was held in the presence of the living descendants of both Émile Zola and Alfred Dreyfus. The event took place in the same cobblestone courtyard of Paris&#x27;s École Militaire where Capitaine Dreyfus had been officially stripped of his officer&#x27;s rank. Chirac stated that &quot;the combat against the dark forces of intolerance and hate is never definitively won&quot;, and called Dreyfus &quot;an exemplary officer&quot; and a &quot;patriot who passionately loved France&quot;. The French National Assembly also held a memorial ceremony of the centennial marking the end of the affair. This was held in remembrance of the 1906 laws that had reintegrated and promoted both Dreyfus and Picquart at the end of the Dreyfus affair.

== Historiography of the Dreyfus affair ==

The Dreyfus affair is distinguished by the large number of books published on this subject.

The contemporary literature of the case was published between 1894 and 1906. It began with the pamphlet of Bernard Lazare, the first intellectual Dreyfusard.

&quot;The Precis of the Dreyfus Affair&quot; by &quot;Henri-Dutrait Crozon&quot;, a pseudonym of Colonel Larpent, is the basis of all anti-Dreyfusard literature after the affair to the present time. The author develops the theory of conspiracy, fueled by Jewish finance, to push Esterhazy to accuse himself of crime. Under a scientific exterior there will be found there an elaboration of theories without evidence or support.

The publication of notes by Schwartzkoppen in 1930 shed light on the guilty role of Esterházy in the affair and exonerated Alfred Dreyfus at the same time, if such vindication was needed. The extreme right questioned the value of this testimony but most historians hold it to be a valid source despite some ambiguities and inaccuracies.

The period of the occupation throws a veil over the case. The liberation and the revelation of the Holocaust brought a deep reflection on all of the Dreyfus affair. Jacques Kayser (1946) then Maurice Paléologue (1955) and Henri Giscard d&#x27;Estaing (1960) revived the case without great revelations, a process generally considered insufficient historically.
Marcel Thomas, chief curator at the National Archives, in 1961 provided through his &quot;The Affair Without Dreyfus&quot; in two volumes a complete review of the history of the affair supported by all available public and private archives. His work is the foundation of all subsequent historical studies.

Reflecting the intense interest in social history that gripped historians since the 1960s and 1970s, Eric Cahm wrote &quot;The Dreyfus Affair in French Society and Politics&quot; (1996), an analysis of the sociology of the affair. Michael Burns, &quot;Rural Society and French Politics, Boulangism and the Dreyfus Affair, 1886–1900&quot; (1984) does the same in a more limited fashion. Vincent Duclert&#x27;s &quot;Biography of Alfred Dreyfus&quot; (2005) includes, in 1300 pages, the complete correspondence of Alfred and Lucie Dreyfus from 1894 to 1899.

Early writers marginalized the role of antisemitism. However since the publication of Jean-Denis Bredin, &quot;The Affair: The Case of Alfred Dreyfus&quot; (1986) and Stephen Wilson, &quot;Ideology and Experience: Antisemitism in France at the Time of the Dreyfus Affair&quot; (1982), more attention has been paid to the undercurrent of antisemitism in French society and its effect on the evolution of the case.

In 1983, the lawyer and historian Jean-Denis Bredin published &quot;L&#x27;Affair&quot; (&quot;The Affair&quot;). The interest of the book focuses on a strictly factual relating of the story with documented facts and multifaceted reflection on the different aspects of the event. The book also revealed for the first time the existence of homosexual correspondence in the prosecution case. Expanding on a 2008 article they published in &quot;la Revue d&#x27;histoire moderne et contemporaine&quot;, in 2012 the historians Pierre Gervais, Pauline Peretz and Pierre Stutin published &quot;Le dossier secret de l&#x27;affaire Dreyfus&quot; (&quot;The Secret Record of the Dreyfus Affair&quot;). Their research enabled the original contents of the secret file to be established. Their thesis was that historians had neglected the correspondence of Schwartzkoppen and Panizzardi, and that homosexuality played a central role in the slandering of Dreyfus.

== In literature ==
The Dreyfus affair provided the basis for many novels. The last work of Émile Zola (1902), &quot;Truth&quot;, transposes the Dreyfus affair to the world of education. Anatole France published &quot;The Island of Penguins&quot; (1907), which recounts the affair in Book VI: &quot;The Case of 80,000 bundles of hay&quot;. Franz Kafka&#x27;s short story &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot; drew inspiration from Devil&#x27;s Island and the debate about justice and punishment the Dreyfus affair provoked in French society. Marcel Proust devoted significant passages of his second, third and fourth volumes of &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; to Parisian society&#x27;s reaction to the Dreyfus affair. Other authors have also contributed, such as Roger Martin du Gard and Maurice Barrès.

The 2013 novel &quot;An Officer and a Spy&quot; by Robert Harris, and the 2019 film adapted from it, tell the story of the Dreyfus affair from Picquart&#x27;s perspective.

<text>In computer systems security, role-based access control (RBAC) or role-based security is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users, and to implementing mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).

Role-based access control is a policy-neutral access control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments. A study by NIST has demonstrated that RBAC addresses many needs of commercial and government organizations. RBAC can be used to facilitate administration of security in large organizations with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions. Although RBAC is different from MAC and DAC access control frameworks, it can enforce these policies without any complication.

== Design ==
Within an organization, roles are created for various job functions. The permissions to perform certain operations are assigned to specific roles. Since users are not assigned permissions directly, but only acquire them through their role (or roles), management of individual user rights becomes a matter of simply assigning appropriate roles to the user&#x27;s account; this simplifies common operations, such as adding a user, or changing a user&#x27;s department.

Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:

# Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
# Role authorization: A subject&#x27;s active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.
# Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject&#x27;s active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized.

Additional constraints may be applied as well, and roles can be combined in a hierarchy where higher-level roles subsume permissions owned by sub-roles.

With the concepts of role hierarchy and constraints, one can control RBAC to create or simulate lattice-based access control (LBAC). Thus RBAC can be considered to be a superset of LBAC.

When defining an RBAC model, the following conventions are useful:
* S = Subject = A person or automated agent
* R = Role = Job function or title which defines an authority level
* P = Permissions = An approval of a mode of access to a resource
* SE = Session = A mapping involving S, R and/or P
* SA = Subject Assignment
* PA = Permission Assignment
* RH = Partially ordered Role Hierarchy. RH can also be written: ≥ (The notation: x ≥ y means that x inherits the permissions of y.)
** A subject can have multiple roles.
** A role can have multiple subjects.
** A role can have many permissions.
** A permission can be assigned to many roles.
** An operation can be assigned to many permissions.
** A permission can be assigned to many operations.

A constraint places a restrictive rule on the potential inheritance of permissions from opposing roles. Thus it can be used to achieve appropriate separation of duties. For example, the same person should not be allowed to both create a login account and to authorize the account creation.

Thus, using set theory notation:
* formula_1 and is a many to many permission to role assignment relation.
* formula_2 and is a many to many subject to role assignment relation.
* formula_3

A subject may have &quot;multiple&quot; simultaneous sessions with/in different roles.

=== Standardized levels ===

The NIST/ANSI/INCITS RBAC standard (2004) recognizes three levels of RBAC:
# core RBAC
# hierarchical RBAC, which adds support for inheritance between roles
# constrained RBAC, which adds separation of duties

== Relation to other models ==
RBAC is a flexible access control technology whose flexibility allows it to implement DAC or MAC. DAC with groups (e.g., as implemented in POSIX file systems) can emulate RBAC. MAC can simulate RBAC if the role graph is restricted to a tree rather than a partially ordered set.

Prior to the development of RBAC, the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model was synonymous with MAC and file system permissions were synonymous with DAC. These were considered to be the only known models for access control: if a model was not BLP, it was considered to be a DAC model, and vice versa. Research in the late 1990s demonstrated that RBAC falls in neither category. Unlike context-based access control (CBAC), RBAC does not look at the message context (such as a connection&#x27;s source). RBAC has also been criticized for leading to role explosion, a problem in large enterprise systems which require access control of finer granularity than what RBAC can provide as roles are inherently assigned to operations and data types. In resemblance to CBAC, an Entity-Relationship Based Access Control (ERBAC, although the same acronym is also used for modified RBAC systems, such as Extended Role-Based Access Control) system is able to secure instances of data by considering their association to the executing subject.

=== Comparing to ACL ===
Access control lists (ACLs) are used in traditional discretionary access-control (DAC) systems to affect low-level data-objects. RBAC differs from ACL in assigning permissions to operations which change the direct-relations between several entities (see: &quot;ACLg&quot; below). For example, an ACL could be used for granting or denying write access to a particular system file, but it wouldn&#x27;t dictate how that file could be changed. In an RBAC-based system, an operation might be to &#x27;create a credit account&#x27; transaction in a financial application or to &#x27;populate a blood sugar level test&#x27; record in a medical application. A Role is thus a sequence of operations within a larger activity. RBAC has been shown to be particularly well suited to separation of duties (SoD) requirements, which ensure that two or more people must be involved in authorizing critical operations. Necessary and sufficient conditions for safety of SoD in RBAC have been analyzed. An underlying principle of SoD is that no individual should be able to effect a breach of security through dual privilege. By extension, no person may hold a role that exercises audit, control or review authority over another, concurrently held role.

Then again, a &quot;minimal RBAC Model&quot;, &quot;RBACm&quot;, can be compared with an ACL mechanism, &quot;ACLg&quot;, where only groups are permitted as entries in the ACL. Barkley (1997) showed that &quot;RBACm&quot; and &quot;ACLg&quot; are equivalent.

In modern SQL implementations, like ACL of the CakePHP framework, ACLs also manage groups and inheritance in a hierarchy of groups. Under this aspect, specific &quot;modern ACL&quot; implementations can be compared with specific &quot;modern RBAC&quot; implementations, better than &quot;old (file system) implementations&quot;.

For data interchange, and for &quot;high level comparisons&quot;, ACL data can be translated to XACML.

=== Attribute-based access control ===
Attribute-based access control or ABAC is a model which evolves from RBAC to consider additional attributes in addition to roles and groups. In ABAC, it is possible to use attributes of:
* the user e.g. citizenship, clearance,
* the resource e.g. classification, department, owner,
* the action, and
* the context e.g. time, location, IP.

ABAC is policy-based in the sense that it uses policies rather than static permissions to define what is allowed or what is not allowed.

=== Relationship-based access control ===

Relationship-based access control or ReBAC is a model which evolves from RBAC. In ReBAC, a subject&#x27;s permission to access a resource is defined by the presence of relationships between those subjects and resources. 

The advantage of this model is that allows for fine-grained permissions; for example, in a social network where users can share posts with other specific users. 

== Use and availability ==
The use of RBAC to manage user privileges (computer permissions) within a single system or application is widely accepted as a best practice. A 2010 report prepared for NIST by the Research Triangle Institute analyzed the economic value of RBAC for enterprises, and estimated benefits per employee from reduced employee downtime, more efficient provisioning, and more efficient access control policy administration.

In an organization with a heterogeneous IT infrastructure and requirements that span dozens or hundreds of systems and applications, using RBAC to manage sufficient roles and assign adequate role memberships becomes extremely complex without hierarchical creation of roles and privilege assignments. Newer systems extend the older NIST RBAC model to address the limitations of RBAC for enterprise-wide deployments. The NIST model was adopted as a standard by INCITS as ANSI/INCITS 359-2004. A discussion of some of the design choices for the NIST model has also been published.

== Potential Vulnerabilities ==
Role based access control interference is a relatively new issue in security applications, where multiple user accounts with dynamic access levels may lead to encryption key instability, allowing an outside user to exploit the weakness for unauthorized access. Key sharing applications within dynamic virtualized environments have shown some success in addressing this problem.

<text>The National Palace Museum, also known as Taipei Palace Museum, is a national museum headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan. Founded in Beijing in 1925, the museum was re-established in Shilin, Taipei, in 1965, later expanded with a southern branch in Taibao, Chiayi, in 2015.

The museum holds a permanent collection of nearly 700,000 pieces of artifacts and artworks, primarily comprising items relocated from the Beijing Palace Museum and other institutions in the mainland China during the government of the Republic of China&#x27;s retreat to Taiwan. Before the re-establishment of the museum in Shilin in 1965, these collections were temporarily housed in various locations across Taiwan.

Spanning 8,000 years of history from the Neolithic to the modern era, the museum&#x27;s collection reflects a comprehensive record of Chinese history. Like the Palace Museum in Beijing, the museum&#x27;s extensive array of artifacts and artworks were based on the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties in the Forbidden City.

==History==

===In Mainland China===

The National Palace Museum was originally established as the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City on 10 October 1925, shortly after the expulsion of Puyi, the last emperor of China, from the Forbidden City by warlord Feng Yuxiang. The articles in the museum consisted of the valuables of the former imperial family.

In 1931, shortly after the Mukden Incident, the Nationalist Government ordered the museum to make preparations to evacuate its most valuable pieces out of the city to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. As a result, from 6 February to 15 May 1933, the Palace Museum&#x27;s 13,491 crates and 6,066 crates of objects from the Exhibition Office of Ancient Artifacts, the Summer Palace and the Imperial Hanlin Academy were moved in five groups to Shanghai. In 1936, the collection was moved to Nanjing after the construction of the storage in the Taoist monastery Chaotian Palace was complete. As the Imperial Japanese Army advanced farther inland during the Second Sino-Japanese War, which merged into the greater conflict of World War II, the collection was moved westward via three routes to several places including Anshun and Leshan until the surrender of Japan in 1945. In 1947, it was shipped back to the warehouse in Nanjing.

===In Taiwan===
The Chinese Civil War resumed following the surrender of the Japanese, ultimately resulting in Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s decision to evacuate the arts to Taiwan, which had been handed over to the ROC in 1945. When the fighting worsened in 1948 between the Communist and Nationalist armies, the National Beijing Palace Museum and other five institutions made the decision to send some of the most prized items to Taiwan. Hang Li-wu, later director of the museum, supervised the transport of some of the collection in three groups from Nanjing to the harbor in Keelung, Taiwan between December 1948 and February 1949. By the time the items arrived in Taiwan, the Communist army had already seized control of the National Palace Museum collection from Beijing, so not all of the collection could be sent to Taiwan. A total of 2,972 crates of artifacts from the Forbidden City moved to Taiwan accounted for only 22% of the crates originally transported south, although the pieces represented some of the very best of the collection.
The collection from the National Beijing Palace Museum, the Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum, the National Central Library, and the National Beijing Library was stored in a railway warehouse in Yangmei following transport across the Taiwan Strait and was later moved to storage in a cane sugar mill near Taichung. In 1949, the Executive Yuan created the Joint Managerial Office for the National Beijing Palace Museum, the Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum, and the National Central Library, to oversee the organization of the collection. For security reasons, the Joint Managerial Office chose the mountain village of Beigou, located in Wufeng, Taichung, as the new storage site for the collection. The following year, the collection stored at the cane sugar mill was transported to the new site in Beigou.

With the National Central Library&#x27;s reinstatement in 1955, the collection from the National Beijing Library was simultaneously incorporated into the National Central Library. The Joint Managerial Office of the National Beijing Palace Museum and the Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum stayed in Beigou for another ten years. During the decade, the office obtained a grant from the Asia Foundation to construct a small-scale exhibition hall in the spring of 1956. The exhibition hall, opened in March 1957, was divided into four galleries in which it was possible to exhibit more than 200 items.

In the autumn of 1960, the office received a grant of NT$32 million from AID. The Republic of China (ROC) government also contributed more than NT$30 million to establish a special fund for the construction of a museum in the Taipei suburb of Waishuanxi. The construction of the museum in Waishuanxi was completed in August 1965. The new museum site was christened the &quot;Chung-Shan Museum&quot; in honor of the founding father of the ROC, Sun Yat-sen, and first opened to the public on the centenary of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s birthday. Since then, the museum in Taipei has managed, conserved and exhibited the collections of the National Beijing Palace Museum and the Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum.

==Architecture==
===Northern Branch===
The National Palace Museum&#x27;s main building in Taipei was designed by Huang Baoyu and constructed from March 1964 to August 1965. Due to the insufficient space to put on display over 600,000 artifacts, the museum underwent expansions in 1967, 1970, 1984 and 1996. In 2002, the museum underwent a major US$21 million renovation revamping the museum to make it more spacious and modern. The renovation closed about two-thirds of the museum section and the museum officially reopened in February 2007.

Permanent exhibitions of painting and calligraphy are rotated once every three months. Approximately 3,000 pieces of the museum&#x27;s collection can be viewed at a given time. Although brief, these exhibitions are extremely popular. In 2014, the museum organized the top three best-attended exhibitions worldwide, including paintings and calligraphic works by Tang Yin, as well as depictions of the Qing dynasty&#x27;s Qianlong Emperor reinterpreted by contemporary artists.

==== Zhishan Garden ====
Housed within the compound of the National Palace Museum, this classical Chinese Song and Ming style garden covers . It incorporates the principles of such diverse fields as feng shui, Chinese architecture, water management, landscape design, and Chinese folklore and metaphor. It contains numerous ponds, waterworks, and wooden Chinese pavilions. It was completed and opened in 1985. There is also a second garden located on the southwest side, known as the Zhide Garden.

==== Chang Dai-chien residence ====
The National Palace Museum also maintains the residence of Chinese painter Chang Dai-chien, also in Shilin, Taipei. The residence, known as the Chang Dai-chien Residence or the Abode of Maya, was constructed in 1976 and completed in 1978. It is a two-story Siheyuan building with Chinese-style gardens occupying approximately 1,911 m2. After Chang&#x27;s death in 1983, the house and gardens were donated to the National Palace Museum and turned into a museum and memorial.

===Southern Branch===
The Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum is located in Taibao, Chiayi County, Taiwan, and set on of land. There is also a lake and Asian style garden on the grounds. Planning for the southern branch began in 2000. The building was to be designed by architect Antoine Predock and began construction in 2005. However, due to serious construction delays and disputes between the contractors and the museum, the firm pulled out in 2008. Museum director Chou Kung-shin stated in August 2010 that new architects Kris Yao for the project would commence, with construction completed in 2015. The project cost NT$7.9 billion (US$268 million) and spread over . The museum itself, 9,000 square meters in total, was designed by the Taiwan-based firm Artech Inc. and is both earthquake resistant and flood resistant. After its grand opening on 28 December 2015, the building was plagued by water leakage, which forced its closure in April 2016. The Southern Branch then reopened on 23 August 2016, after repairs to address the water leakage issues were completed.

==Collections==
Complete inventory inspection has been taken three times in 1951–1954, 1989–1991 and 2008–2012 since the museum started to bring collections to Taiwan in 1948. According to official report, the museum houses Chinese calligraphy, porcelain, bronzes, paintings, jades and many other artifacts, with 22% (2,972 out of 13,491 crates) of the boxes originally transported south from the Forbidden City. Other additions include transfers from other institutions, donations, and purchases made by the museum. A large number of these artifacts were brought by Chiang Kai-shek before his Kuomintang forces fled the mainland in 1949. The museum has accumulated nearly 700,000 artifacts of significant historical or artistic values. With a collection of this size, only 1% of the collection is exhibited at any given time. The rest of the collection is stored in temperature-controlled vaults.

The museum houses several treasured items that are the pride of their collection and famous worldwide. The antiquities in the National Palace Museum span over thousands of years with a variety of genres.

=== Metalwork ===
Among the collections of bronzes, &quot;Zong Zhou Zhong&quot; (&quot;Bell of Zhou&quot;), commissioned by King Li of Zhou, is the most important musical instrument cast under his royal decree. &quot;Mao Gong Ding&quot; (Cauldron of Duke of Mao) of the late Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BCE) carries the longest Chinese bronze inscriptions so far extant.

In 1995, the museum acquired the Taihe Shakyamuni, a statue of The Buddha from the Northern Wei Dynasty, that represents a pivotal shift from early Indian style towards Chinese Buddhist style.

=== Ceramics ===
With 21 pieces out of fewer than 80 surviving, the museum has the world&#x27;s largest collection of Ru ware, one of the rarest Chinese ceramics, made exclusively for the court and one of the Five Great Kilns of the Song dynasty (960–1279), along with Ding porcelain, Jun ware, Guan and Ge; the museum has major collections of all of these. Those from the official kilns of the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1912) dynasties, such as the &quot;doucai&quot; porcelains of the Chenghua reign during the Ming dynasty and painted enamel porcelains from the early Qing, are also of excellent quality.

=== Carvings ===
One of the most popular pieces of jade carvings in the museum is the &quot;Jadeite Cabbage&quot;, a piece of jadeite carved into the shape of a cabbage head, and with a large and a small grasshopper camouflaged in the leaves. The ruffled semi-translucent leaves attached is due to the masterful combination of various natural color of the jade to recreate the color variations of a real cabbage. The &quot;Meat-shaped Stone&quot; is often exhibited together with the Jadeite Cabbage. A piece of jasper, a form of agate, the strata of which are cleverly used to create a likeness of a piece of pork cooked in soy sauce. The dyed and textured surface makes the layers of skin, lean meat, and fat materialized incredibly lifelike.

Other various carvings of materials such as bamboo, wood, ivory, rhinoceros horn, and fruit pits are exhibited. The &quot;Carved Olive-stone Boat&quot;, carved by Chen Zuzhang, is a tiny boat carved from an olive stone. The incredibly fully equipped skilled piece is carved with a covered deck and moveable windows. The interior has chairs, dishes on a table and eight figures representing the characters of Su Shih&#x27;s &quot;Latter Ode on the Red Cliff&quot;. The bottom is carved in minute character the entire 300+ character text with the date and the artist&#x27;s name.

=== Painting and calligraphy ===
The paintings in the National Palace Museum date from the Tang dynasty (618–907) to the modern era. The collection covers over one thousand years of Chinese painting, and encompasses a wide range of genres, including landscape, flower and bird, figure painting, boundary painting, etc. Among the most popular paintings in the collection is the &quot;Qing Palace Version of Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot; by five Qing dynasty court painters (Chen Mu, Sun Hu, Jin Kun, Dai Hong and Cheng Zhidao). &quot;Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains&quot; (Wu-yung version) by Huang Gongwang of the Yuan dynasty is one of the rarest and most dramatic works. &quot;Walking on a Mountain Path in Spring&quot; is another significant work. The museum has a vast collection of calligraphy works from the hands of major calligraphers, scholars and important courtiers in history. The calligraphy works date from the Jin (266–420) and Tang (618–907) dynasties, with a variety of styles.

=== Rare books and documents ===
Rare books in the National Palace Museum range from the Song (960–1279) and Yuan (1271–1368) dynasties to the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1912) dynasties, amounting to over 200,000 volumes. &quot;Yongle Encyclopedia&quot; and &quot;Complete Library of the Four Treasuries&quot; are among the examples.

Historical documents in the museum include &quot;Jiu Manzhou Dang&quot;, a set of Manchu archives that are the sourcebook of &quot;Manwen Laodang&quot; and a primary source of early Manchu history. Other official documents such as the court archives are available for research in the history of the Qing dynasty.

=== Overseas exhibitions ===

Due to fears that the artifacts may be impounded and claimed by China due to the controversial political status of Taiwan, the museum does not conduct exhibitions in mainland China. Since the museum&#x27;s 1965 establishment in Taipei, the National Palace Museum has only made six large overseas exhibitions in countries which have passed laws to prevent judicial seizure of the treasures: the United States in 1996, France in 1998, Germany in 2003, Austria in 2008, Japan in 2014 and Australia in 2019.

==Administration==

The National Palace Museum operates under the Executive Yuan as a level-two agency. It has been headed by many directors over the years: Note that, in 1949, the Joint Managerial Office of the National Central Museum and National Central Library was established. In 1955, the Joint Managerial Office of the National Palace Museum and National Central Museum was established.

=== List of directors ===
== Controversies and criticism ==
=== Ownership disputes ===
According to writer Ian Johnson, many cultural items on the mainland were destroyed under communist rule and during the Cultural Revolution, so the Kuomintang built the new National Palace Museum to show that Taiwan is the better China. Now that the Chinese communist party has redefined its mission to protect China&#x27;s cultural past, Beijing has requested the return of the artefacts displayed in Taipei. The museum refuses to do so and does not loan them to other countries either, for fear that they might be indirectly repatriated to the Chinese mainland.

Amid warmer relations in recent years, the Palace Museum in Beijing has lent relics to the National Palace Museum since 2009. The Palace Museum curator Zheng Xinmiao said that the artifacts in both mainland and Taiwan museums are &quot;China&#x27;s cultural heritage jointly owned by people across the Taiwan Strait.&quot;

=== Illegal appropriation ===
A number of Chinese artifacts dating from the Tang and Song dynasties, some of which had been owned by Emperor Zhenzong, were excavated and then came into the hands of the Kuomintang General Ma Hongkui, who refused to publicize the findings. Among the artifacts were a white marble tablet from the Tang dynasty, gold nails, and bands made out of metal. It was not until after Ma died that his wife went to Taiwan in 1971 from the United States to bring the artifacts to Chiang Kai-shek, who turned them over to the National Palace Museum.

=== Safety concerns ===
In October 2022, it was revealed that three artefacts from the Ming and Qing dynasties, reportedly worth US$77 million, had been damaged. In response to inquiries, the museum admitted that two teacups were found broken in February and April that year, and a plate was dropped in May. Director Wu Mi-cha suspected that the teacups might have been damaged due to unsatisfactory storage practices, which the museum is working to improve.

In August 2022, PLA drills around Taiwan raised concerns over the potential safety of the museum&#x27;s artifacts. Former director Chou Kung-shin suggested creating a plan to store them in the mountain tunnels nearby. After they were originally shipped into Taiwan, the artifacts were first stored inside tunnels in Taichung during the 1950s before being moved to Taipei, where the museum was eventually built.

<doc id="66185" wikidata="Q609377" url="?curid=66185" title="Vinland Map">
<text>The Vinland Map was claimed to be a 15th-century mappa mundi with unique information about Norse exploration of North America but is now known to be a 20th-century forgery. The map first came to light in 1957 and was acquired by Yale University. It became well known due to the publicity campaign which accompanied its revelation to the public as a &quot;genuine&quot; pre-Columbian map in 1965. In addition to showing Africa, Asia and Europe, the map depicts a landmass south-west of Greenland in the Atlantic labelled as Vinland (&quot;Vinlanda Insula&quot;).

The map describes this region as having been visited by Europeans in the 11th century. Although it was presented to the world in 1965 with an accompanying scholarly book written by British Museum and Yale University librarians, historians of geography and medieval document specialists began to suspect that it might be a fake as soon as photographs of it became available, and chemical analyses have identified one of the major ink ingredients as a 20th-century artificial pigment.

In 2018, after several investigations and many years of debate, specialists at Yale declared that the latest scientific and historical research had conclusively established that it was a modern forgery. The map remains in Yale University&#x27;s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library as part of its collection.

The Vinland map first came to light in 1957 (three years before the discovery of the Norse site at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland in 1960), bound in a slim volume with a short medieval text called the &quot;Hystoria Tartarorum&quot; (usually called in English the &quot;Tartar Relation&quot;), and was unsuccessfully offered to the British Museum by London book dealer Irving Davis on behalf of a Spanish-Italian dealer named Enzo Ferrajoli de Ry. Shortly afterwards, Ferrajoli sold the volume, for $3,500, to American dealer Laurence C. Witten II, who offered it to his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Yale University. It was initially treated with suspicion, partly because wormholes in the map and the &quot;Relation&quot; did not match. In early 1958, however, Witten&#x27;s friend Thomas Marston, a Yale librarian, acquired from London book dealer Irving Davis a dilapidated medieval copy of books 21–24 of Vincent of Beauvais&#x27;s encyclopedic &quot;Speculum historiale&quot; (&quot;Historical Mirror&quot;), written in two columns on a mix of parchment and paper sheets, with initial capitals left blank, which turned out to be the missing link; the wormholes showing that it had formerly had the map at its beginning and the &quot;Relation&quot; at its end. All traces of former ownership marks, except for a small part of a bright pink stamp which overlapped the writing on folio 223 of the &quot;Speculum&quot;, had been removed, perhaps to avoid tax liability for the former owner (although as historian Kirsten Seaver noted many years later, stamps on random book pages indicate institutional, not private ownership).

Yale was unable to afford the asking price and was concerned because Witten refused to reveal the provenance of the map, ostensibly because of the former private owner&#x27;s tax concerns. Yale contacted another alumnus, Paul Mellon, who agreed to buy it (for a price later stated to be about $300,000) and donate it to the university if it could be authenticated. Recognizing its potential importance as the earliest map unambiguously showing America, Mellon insisted that its existence be kept secret until a scholarly book had been written about it. Even the three authors of the book were chosen from among the small number of people who had seen the map before Mellon bought it—two British Museum curators and Marston. Only one of them, Raleigh Ashlin Skelton, keeper of the Museum&#x27;s map collection, had significant expertise relevant to the problems posed by the map. (His colleague George Painter, the first person to whom Davis had shown the map in 1957, was brought in for the transcription and translation of the &quot;Relation&quot;.) The secrecy almost completely ruled out consultation with specialists. Witten did his best to help during this period, answering the authors&#x27; questions and offering suggestions of his own. After years of study, the proofs of the book, &quot;The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation&quot;, were ready by the end of 1964, and Mellon donated the map to Yale. The book was published, and the map revealed to the world, the day before Columbus Day, 1965.

== Controversies and investigations 1966–2018 ==

=== Vinland Map Conference 1966 ===

Many academic reviewers of &quot;The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation&quot; took the opportunity to point out evidence that called the map&#x27;s authenticity into question. So a year later, a Vinland Map Conference was held at the Smithsonian Institution, during which further significant questions were asked, particularly of Witten. However, the proceedings were not published for another five years.

There were questions about the actual content of the map. Witten had pointed out that it bore strong resemblances to a map made in the 1430s by Italian mariner Andrea Bianco, but others found some of the similarities and differences very strange—the map cuts off Africa where Bianco&#x27;s map has a page fold, but distorts shapes, and includes major revisions in the far east and west. The most surprising revision is that, unlike, for example, the famous Cantino World Map, the Vinland Map depicts Greenland as an island, remarkably close to the correct shape and orientation (while Norway, of which Greenland was just a colony, is wildly inaccurate) although contemporary Scandinavian accounts—including the work of Claudius Clavus in the 1420s—depict Greenland as a peninsula joined to northern Russia. For practical purposes, Arctic sea ice may have made this description true, and Greenland is not known to have been successfully circumnavigated until the 20th century. Skelton wondered also whether the revisions in the far east were meant to represent Japan—they seem to show not only Honshu, but also Hokkaido and Sakhalin, omitted even from Oriental maps in the 15th century.

In addition, the text uses a Latin form of Leif Ericson&#x27;s name (&quot;Erissonius&quot;) more consistent with 17th-century norms and with transmission through a French or Italian source. The Latin captions include several usages of the ligature &quot;æ&quot;; this was almost unknown in later medieval times (a simple &quot;e&quot; was written instead), and although the ligature was revived by Italian humanist scholars in the early 15th century, it is found only in documents of deliberately classicising humanist minuscule produced by Italian scribes, and never in conjunction with a Gothic style of script such as is seen in the map.

Another point calling the map&#x27;s authenticity into question was raised at the 1966 Conference: that one caption referred to Bishop Eirik of Greenland &quot;and neighboring regions&quot; (in Latin, &quot;regionumque finitimarum&quot;), a title known previously from the work of religious scholar Luka Jelić (1864–1922). An essay by British researcher Peter Foote for the &quot;Saga Book of the Viking Society&quot; (vol. 11, part 1), published shortly after the conference, noted that German researcher Richard Hennig (1874–1951) had spent years, before the Vinland Map was revealed, fruitlessly trying to track Jelić&#x27;s phrase down in medieval texts. It seemed that either Jelić had seen the Vinland Map and promised not to reveal its existence (keeping the promise so rigidly that he never mentioned any of the other new historical information on the map), or that he had invented the phrase as a scholarly description, and the Vinland Map creator copied him. In practice, because Jelić&#x27;s work had gone through three editions, Foote was able to demonstrate how the first edition (in French) had adopted the concept from the work of earlier researchers, listed by Jelić, then the later editions had adapted the anachronistic French scholarly phrase &quot;évêque régionnaire des contrées américaines&quot; into Latin.

Handwriting experts at the 1966 Conference tended to disagree with Witten&#x27;s assessment that the map captions had been written by the same person as the &quot;Speculum&quot; and &quot;Relation&quot; texts. This had also been a major reason why the British Museum had rejected the map in 1957, the Keeper of Manuscripts having detected elements of handwriting style not developed until the nineteenth century.

=== Analysis of ink ===

Complaints were made at the Conference that no scientist had been permitted to examine the map and its companion documents in all the years of study since 1957. Skelton&#x27;s scientific colleagues at the British Museum made a short preliminary examination in 1967 and found that:
 
In 1972, with new technology becoming available, Yale sent the map for chemical analysis by forensic specialist Walter McCrone whose team, using a variety of techniques, found that the yellowish lines contain anatase (titanium dioxide) in a rounded crystalline form manufactured for use in pale pigments since the 1920s, indicating that the ink was modern. They also confirmed that the ink contained only trace amounts of iron, and that the black line remnants were on top of the yellow, indicating that they were not the remains of a penciled guide-line, as the British Museum staff had speculated.

A new investigation in the early 1980s, by a team under Thomas Cahill at the University of California, Davis, using Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) found that only trace amounts (&lt; 0.0062% by weight) of titanium appeared to be present in the ink, which should have been too little for some of McCrone&#x27;s analyses to detect. The Cahill team acknowledged, however, that titanium was the only element within their technique&#x27;s measurement capability which was significantly more concentrated in the ink than on the bare parchment (other elements such as iron and zinc were found concentrated in some inked samples, but only a minority). One member of the team, Gregory Möller, also analyzed loose particles retrieved from the split down the middle of the map by a different method, finding that most of them were rich in titanium (though a few black particles were rich in chromium and iron). Because they were the first to apply PIXE to ink analysis, nobody at the time could explain the difference between the Cahill and McCrone figures. Attempting to reconcile the conflicting results, the Cahill team suggested that the high concentrations found by McCrone were due to a combination of contamination from modern dust, and poor sample selection (i.e. choosing contaminant particles like those in the split); however, they also chose not to publish or publicise Möller&#x27;s loose particle study. The accumulation of large amounts of PIXE data from other laboratories around the world in the ensuing decades was sufficient by 2008 to show that the Cahill figures for all elements in the inks of the map and its companion documents are at least a thousand times too small, so the discrepancy is due to a problem with their work.

The McCrone team had also made mistakes, though none as fundamental as Cahill&#x27;s. Revisiting his notes in 1987 to draft a detailed reply to the abbreviated public version of Cahill&#x27;s report, Walter McCrone chose the wrong sample to illustrate a &quot;typical&quot; black ink particle, selecting one which had been found only loosely attached to the ink. By focusing on this contamination, rich in chromium and iron, he gave Cahill the opportunity to re-emphasise his case in an essay for an expanded version of the 1965 official book, a few years later.

In 1991, McCrone, then director and senior research microscopist with the McCrone Research Institute, visited Yale to take new microsamples from the map, partly to check his earlier results, and partly to apply new techniques. Photomicrographs taken at 1 micrometer intervals through the thickness of ink samples demonstrated that the manufactured anatase particles were not just sticking to the surface as Cahill&#x27;s criticisms had implied, and Fourier transform spectroscopy identified the ink&#x27;s binder as gelatin, probably made from animal skin. In July 2002, using Raman spectroscopy, the presence of significant quantities of anatase in the map ink was confirmed by British researchers Katherine Brown and Robin Clark, and the remaining traces of black pigment in the ink were found to consist essentially of soot-type carbon.

Various scientists have formed their own theories to explain how the 20th century manufactured anatase in the Vinland Map ink could have got into genuine medieval ink. The first was chemist Jacqueline Olin, then a researcher with the Smithsonian Institution, who in the 1970s conducted experiments which produced anatase at an early stage of a medieval iron-gall ink production process. Examination of her anatase by a colleague, mineralogist Kenneth Towe, showed that it was very different from the neat, rounded crystals found in the Vinland Map and modern pigments. Towe himself, a clay specialist, briefly considered the possibility that the anatase could have come from clay, where it is present in trace amounts, but on checking McCrone&#x27;s data found no significant traces of clay minerals. Shortly before the Raman analysis was published, historian Douglas McNaughton based a mistaken theory about the ink around McCrone&#x27;s emphasis on the chromium-rich black particle, having obtained unpublished data on the similar particles in Möller&#x27;s report.
Olin published a paper that identifies the anatase in the Vinland Map ink as being truncated bi-pyramidal rather than rounded crystals (however, this is not vastly different from the McCrones&#x27; 1974 description of the crystals as &quot;smooth, rounded rhomb shapes&quot;).

=== Dating of parchment ===
Radiocarbon dating, begun in 1995 by physicist Douglass Donahue and chemists Jacqueline Olin and Garman Harbottle, placed the origin of the parchment somewhere between 1423 and 1445. The initial results were confusing because the unknown substance the British Museum had found across the whole map, effectively ignored by later researchers who were concentrating on the ink, turned out to be trapping tiny traces of fallout deep within the parchment from 1950s nuclear tests. Although there was none of this 1950s substance on top of the ink, further tests, starting with a detailed chemical analysis, were needed to confirm whether the lines were drawn after it soaked into the parchment.

In 2008, Harbottle&#x27;s attempt to explain a possible medieval origin for the ink was published, but he was shown by Towe and others to have misunderstood the significance of the various analyses, rendering his theory meaningless.

===&quot;VMTR 95&quot;===
The expanded 30th anniversary edition of the 1965 official book, &quot;The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation&quot;, was notable for its exclusion of most of the evidence against the map&#x27;s authenticity, concentrating instead on vindications by George Painter, and Thomas Cahill with colleague Bruce Kusko (in which they claimed specifically that they had not analyzed the loose particles they took from the map at the time of their PIXE research), but it did reprint an essay written in 1989 by the original book dealer Laurence Witten. He stated that, when the McCrone investigation concluded the map to be a forgery in 1974, he was asked by Yale to reveal its provenance as a matter of urgency, and to discuss the possible return of Mr Mellon&#x27;s money. He replied that he had no idea where the map came from, beyond Ferrajoli (who was convicted of theft shortly after the sale, and died shortly after release from prison). On the subject of the money, he said he could not pay it all back because he had paid agreed shares of his profit to Ferrajoli and to another dealer who had introduced him. For his part, Mellon did not ask for the return of any money. The essay also revealed that Witten had, on Ferrajoli&#x27;s recommendation, met with Irving Davis after buying the map volume in 1957.

Regardless of the controversy, the map, which had been valued for insurance purposes at over $750,000 in the 1960s, was claimed in 1996 to be worth $25,000,000.

=== &quot;Maps, Myths, and Men&quot;, 2004 ===
In 2004, Kirsten A. Seaver published &quot;Maps, Myths, and Men: The Story of the Vinland Map&quot;, a wide-ranging review of the arguments and evidence presented to that date. Seaver was hailed as the Vinland map&#x27;s &quot;most thorough and outspoken critic in recent years&quot; for her &quot;exemplary interdisciplinary study&quot;. She also theorized that the forger could have been Father Josef Fischer (1858–1944), an Austrian cartographer and Jesuit scholar. However, subsequent research into the provenance of the Vinland map documents (see below) suggests that they are unlikely to have spent any time in Fischer&#x27;s possession. Robert Baier, a forensic handwriting analyst, examined the map text and correspondence of Fischer, and his opinion was that &quot;they are not the same writer.&quot;

=== Danish investigation, 2005–2009 ===
In 2005 a team from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, led by René Larsen, studied the map and its accompanying manuscripts to make recommendations on the best ways to preserve it. Among other findings, this study confirmed that the two halves of the map were entirely separate, though they might have been joined in the past. A few months earlier, Kirsten Seaver had suggested that a forger could have found two separate blank leaves in the original &quot;Speculum Historiale&quot; volume, from which the first few dozen pages appeared to be missing, and joined them together with the binding strip. On the other hand, at the International Conference on the History of Cartography in July 2009, Larsen revealed that his team had continued their investigation after publishing their original report, and he told the press that &quot;All the tests that we have done over the past five years—on the materials and other aspects—do not show any signs of forgery&quot;. The formal report of his presentation showed that his work ignored rather than contradicted earlier studies. For example, he experimented only with artificial wormholes, and did not follow up the observation made at the 1966 Conference, that live bookworms were a known tool of the fake antiquities trade. Similarly, he claimed that the anatase in the ink could have come from sand used to dry it (the hypothetical source of the sand being gneiss from the Binnenthal area of Switzerland) but his team had not examined the crystals microscopically, and Kenneth Towe responded that this was an essential test, given that crystal size and shape should clearly distinguish commercial anatase from anatase found in sand.

Members of the Danish team later joined with others to perform microanalyses of the remaining piece from the 1995 carbon dating sample. They found a significant quantity of monostearin (Glycerol monostearate) which is commonly used in the food and pharmaceutical industries, with additional aromatic compounds. It was thought that if it was not purely localised contamination from handling by somebody using something like hand lotion, it was likely to be the unidentified post-1950 chemical soaked into the parchment. Their microscopic examination confirmed that the parchment had been treated very roughly at some time, with 95% of fibres damaged.

===&quot;A Sorry Saga&quot; 2018 ===

In June 2013, it was reported in the British press that a Scottish researcher, John Paul Floyd, claimed to have discovered two pre-1957 references to the Yale &quot;Speculum&quot; and &quot;Tartar Relation&quot; manuscripts which shed light on the provenance of the documents. According to one of these sources (an exhibition catalogue), a 15th-century manuscript volume containing books 21-24 of the &quot;Speculum Historiale&quot; and C. de Bridia&#x27;s &quot;Historia Tartarorum&quot; was lent by the Archdiocese of Zaragoza for display at the 1892–93 &quot;Exposición Histórico-Europea&quot; (an event held in Madrid, Spain to commemorate the voyages of Columbus). Floyd noted that Spanish priest and scholar Cristóbal Pérez Pastor also reported having seen such a codex, in historical notes organised and published posthumously in 1926. Neither the catalogue entry nor Pérez Pastor&#x27;s description mentioned the presence of a map. It is known that Enzo Ferrajoli, who offered the Vinland manuscript for sale in 1957, was convicted of having stolen manuscripts from the Cathedral Library of La Seo, Zaragoza, in the 1950s. 

Separately, Floyd also observed that the creator of the Vinland Map had evidently made use of an 18th-century engraving of the 1436 Bianco map by Vincenzio Formaleoni (1752–97), since the Vinland Map reproduces several of Formaleoni&#x27;s copying errors. He argued that this furnished a new and decisive proof that the map is inauthentic.

Floyd&#x27;s book appeared in 2018 under the title, &quot;A Sorry Saga: Theft, Forgery, Scholarship... and the Vinland Map&quot;.

==Identification as a forgery, 2018==
As controversy has swirled around the map almost since its acquisition, authorities at Yale University chose not to comment on the authenticity of the parchment document. In 2002, Yale librarian Alice Prochaska commented that &quot;We regard ourselves as the custodians of an extremely interesting and controversial document…and we watch the scholarly work on it with great interest.&quot; However, in 2011, Yale&#x27;s Chester D. Tripp Professor of History, Paul Freedman, did express his view that the map was &quot;unfortunately a fake&quot;.

At the 2018 Vinland Map Symposium, Yale conservation scientist Richard Hark revealed the results of new global chemical analyses of the Map and the Tartar Relation, which established, among many other things, that the ink lines of the Map contain varying amounts of anatase &quot;consistent with modern manufacture&quot;. So too do two small patches on the first page of the Tartar Relation, where the original iron-gall ink appears to have been erased and replaced.

Raymond Clemens, Curator of Early Books and Manuscripts at Yale&#x27;s Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, considers that the latest historical and scientific research proves &quot;beyond a doubt&quot; that the Vinland map &quot;was a forgery, not a medieval product as it claimed to be.&quot; In a March 2019 article, Clemens highlights the fact that &quot;historical investigations by John Paul Floyd have revealed that the Vinland Map is actually based not on Bianco’s 1436 map, but on a printed facsimile map made in 1782. Floyd discovered this by noting mistakes in the 1782 map that were replicated on the Vinland map, but could be found nowhere else.&quot; Furthermore, the map has been studied at the Beinecke Library using new technology. &quot;In the case of the Vinland map we were able to prove... [the map] was clearly a 20th century fake.&quot; Despite the reveal of the map&#x27;s forged origins, Clemens stated that the map would remain at the Beinecke Library, as it had &quot;become an historical object in and of itself.&quot;
