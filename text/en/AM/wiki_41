<text>The Actors&#x27; Equity Association (AEA), commonly called Actors&#x27; Equity or simply Equity, is an American labor union representing those who work in live theatrical performance. Performers appearing in live stage productions without a book or through-storyline (vaudeville, cabarets, circuses) may be represented by the American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA). The AEA works to negotiate quality living conditions, livable wages, and benefits for performers and stage managers. A theater or production that is not produced and performed by AEA members may be called &quot;non-Equity&quot;.

==Background==
Leading up to the Actors&#x27; and Producers&#x27; strike of 1929, Hollywood and California in general had a series of workers&#x27; equality battles that directly influenced the film industry. The films &quot;The Passaic Textile Strike&quot; (1926), &quot;The Miners&#x27; Strike&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Gastonia Textile Strike&quot; (1929) gave audience and producers insight into the effect and accomplishments of labor unions and striking. These films were set apart by being current documentaries, not merely melodramas produced for glamor.

In 1896, the first Actors Union Charter was recognized by the American Federation of Labor as an attempt to create a minimum wage for actors being exploited. It was not until January 13, 1913, that the Union Charter failed. It later reemerged as the Actors Equity Association, with more than 111 actors and Francis Wilson as its founding board president.

==History==
At a meeting held at the Pabst Grand Circle Hotel in New York City, on May 26, 1913, Actors&#x27; Equity was founded by 112 professional theater actors, who established its constitution and elected Francis Wilson as president.

Leading up to the association&#x27;s establishment, a handful of influential actors—known as The Players—held secret organizational meetings at Edwin Booth&#x27;s The Players at its Gramercy Park mansion. A bronze plaque commemorates the room in which The Players met to establish Actors&#x27; Equity. Members included Frank Gillmore, who from was the executive secretary of Actors&#x27; Equity from 1918 to 1929 and president from 1929 to 1937.

Actors&#x27; Equity joined the American Federation of Labor in 1919, and called a strike seeking recognition as a labor union. The strike ended the dominance of the Producing Managers&#x27; Association, including theater owners and producers like Abe Erlanger and his partner, Mark Klaw. The strike increased membership from under 3,000 to approximately 14,000. The Chorus Equity Association, which merged with Actors&#x27; Equity in 1955, was founded during the strike.

Equity represented directors and choreographers until 1959, when they broke away and formed their own union.

==1929 nationwide actors and producers strike threat==
The Actors Equality Strike was a series of walkouts that started in 1927 in local theaters in Los Angeles and quickly grew to the motion picture stage. During the nationwide walkouts, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences started issuing contracts to freelance film actors, which led Hollywood&#x27;s actors and actresses to fear the loss of their jobs. The theater strikes combined with freelance contracts fueled the need for actors and stagehands to strike for better working conditions and pay.

Frank Gillmore, the head and treasurer of the Actor&#x27;s Equity Association, understood that he would need multiple unions across the country to make a change not only in proper representation and pay, but in actors&#x27; ability to negotiate any contract a studio would put out worldwide. On July 20, 1929, the AEA gained its first victory, which gave producers and actors a leg to stand on in their battle for equality. Over 30 days (up to August 20, 1929), Gillmore fought to give the AEA the ability to represent all actors, producers, radio personality, vaudeville performers, and agents in the country. This would also give all power and representation to one organization in order to create a more organized equality strike.

Starting on June 5, 1929, Gillmore attended several meetings in New York with the heads of Broadway. After the meeting, he notified the AEA that appearances in sound and talking motion pictures had been suspended until the outcome of the meetings with the international Studio Crafts Union.

Due to the negotiations and the suspension of contracts through the AEA, studios were desperate for actors to speed up production, which had dropped significantly. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It was pointed out that while the Equality regulations were in effect, about 2000 motion picture contracts, involving salaries said to amount to $500,000 were offered to actors in New York.&quot; Any actor who entered into a contract not approved by the AEA would be banished from the union and have to reapply for admission after negotiations were finished.

By December 1929, the AEA was negotiating terms to reset the movie stage under better conditions, but this was the least of its problems. In late December, groups of theater owners and non-represented producers filed lawsuits to claim damages from the AEA&#x27;s contract holdout. &quot;The plaintiffs not only seek a temporary injunction against the defendants, pending trial on an order to show cause why a permanent injunction should not be granted, but also ask damages of $100,000.&quot;

==Effects of strike==
The AEA allowed small numbers of contracts to be negotiated over the next few years. In 1933, the Screen Actors Guild was created and took the AEA&#x27;s place as the main representative for movie actors and producers. This allowed the AEA to focus on live productions, such as theatrical performances, while the Screen Actors Guild focused on movie production and non-scripted live performances, such as minstrel, vaudeville, and live radio shows.

==Causes==
In the 1940s, the AEA stood against segregation. When actors were losing jobs through 1950s McCarthyism and the Hollywood blacklist, the AEA refused to participate. Although its constitution guaranteed its members the right to refuse to work alongside Communists, or a member of a Communist front organization, the AEA did not ban any members. At a 1997 ceremony commemorating the blacklist&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Richard Masur, then president of the Screen Actors Guild, apologized for its participation in the ban, saying: &quot;Only our sister union, Actors&#x27; Equity Association, had the courage to stand behind its members and help them continue their creative lives in the theater. For that, we honor Actors&#x27; Equity tonight.&quot;

In the 1960s, the AEA played a role in gaining public funding for the arts, including the founding of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).

The AEA fought the destruction of historic Broadway theaters. It played a major role in the recognition of the impact the AIDS epidemic on the world of theater, co-founding Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.

== Joining ==
In 2021, Actor&#x27;s Equity introduced an &quot;Open Access&quot; membership policy, whereby &quot;any theatre worker who can demonstrate they have worked professionally as an actor or stage manager within Equity&#x27;s geographical jurisdiction&quot; may join the union. This opened eligibility to the union to theatre workers who had not previously worked for Equity employers. Theatre workers need to provide a copy of their contract and proof of pay. This policy was made permanent in 2023, superseding previous methods for earning eligibility to join Equity such as the Equity Membership Candidate (EMC) program.

Asides from Open Access, theatre workers may join Equity by being employed under an Equity contract, or by being a member of one of Equity&#x27;s sister performing arts unions, the &quot;Four A&#x27;s&quot;: SAG-AFTRA, AGMA, AGVA or GIAA. Such applicants must have been a member of said sister union for at least one year, be a member in good standing of that union, have worked as a performer under the union&#x27;s jurisdiction on a principal or &quot;under-five&quot; contract or at least three days of extra (&quot;background&quot;) work, and must have completed non-union theatrical work.

== Contracts ==
The AEA has several different types of contract, with different rules associated with them. Each contract type deals with a specific type of theater venue or production type. These include, but are not limited to: Council of Resident Stock Theatres (CORST), Guest Artist, Letters of Agreement (LoA), League of Resident Theatres (LoRT) Small Professional Theatres (SPT), and Theatre for Young Audiences (TYA).

AEA actors and stage managers are not allowed to work in non-Equity houses or on any productions in which an Equity Agreement has not been signed anywhere within the AEA&#x27;s jurisdiction.

==Equity waiver plan==

The Equity Waiver Plan, originally implemented in 1972, was designed to support small theaters in Los Angeles by allowing non-union actors to perform in venues with 99 seats or fewer, offering lower pay scales and flexible production terms. Initially, actors were paid between $5 and $14 per performance, with productions exceeding 80 performances required to transition to a union contract. The plan fueled the growth of small theaters and spurred artistic achievement in the region. However, by 2000, AEA shifted the focus from box office earnings to theater size to determine payments for the first 12 weeks of a production. A 2014 survey revealed dissatisfaction among members, with many feeling the plan favored producers over actors. Despite these criticisms, the plan helped many small theaters evolve into midsize operations paying higher wages.

<doc id="68841" wikidata="Q147911" url="?curid=68841" title="Zaretan">
<text>Zaretan or Zarethan (), also known as Zeredathah, is a city mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as near the location where the Hebrews crossed the Jordan (). In the books of Joshua (, KJV &quot;Zaretan&quot;) and 1 Kings ( KJV &quot;Zartanah&quot;, &quot;Zarthan&quot;), it is called Zarethan, but in 2 Chronicles it is called Zeredathah (, KJV).

Zaredathah stood in the Jordan Valley. Nelson Glueck looked for it on the east bank of the river, proposing , but some more recent authors place it on the west bank, one theory identifying it with Tell el-Mazar, also spelled Mezar, in Wadi Far&#x27;a. Tell el-Mezar is at the site called in Arabic Qerawa, known from antiquity by the name Korea(i) (κορεα[ι]) or Koreous (Kορεους) and located at the foot of Mount Sartabe.

According to Hebrew Bible, the bronze castings for the Solomon&#x27;s Temple were made in the clay grounds between Sukkot and Zaretan.

The old identification of the site of the miracle of the Israelites&#x27; crossing of the Jordan with the waters stopping their flow at the &quot;city of Adam beside Zaretan&quot; was, according to the Easton&#x27;s Bible Dictionary (1893 and 1897), presumed to be near Succoth, where the Jabbok flows into the Jordan, about 30 miles upstream from the Israelite camp. There the priests stepped into the water, which then &quot;stood and rose upon an heap&quot;, thus creating a 30-mile stretch of dry riverbed for the tribes to use for crossing over to the Promised Land (; compare ).

<doc id="68845" wikidata="Q451893" url="?curid=68845" title="Amadeus I, Count of Savoy">
<text>Amadeus I (c. 1016 – c. 1051), nicknamed of the Tail or la Coda (Latin &quot;caudatus&quot;, &quot;tailed&quot;), was an early count of the House of Savoy. He was probably the eldest son of Humbert I. His nickname derives from an anecdote, preserved only in a thirteenth-century manuscript, that when he met the Emperor Henry III at Verona in 1046, he refused to enter the emperor&#x27;s chambers without his large train of knights, his &quot;tail&quot;.

Amadeus is first attested in a document of 8 April 1022, when, along with his younger brother Burchard, bishop of Belley, he witnessed a donation of Lambert, bishop of Langres, to his father. Probably sometime after this and before 1030, Amadeus, Burchard, and a third brother, Otto, joined their father in witnessing a donation made by one Aymon de Pierrefort to the Abbey of Cluny. In a further two undated charters of probably about the same period, Amadeus together with his brothers Otto and Aymon and his father made donations to the Abbey of Cluny and the church of Saint-Maurice at Matassine. Amadeus and his father also witnessed another donation, made by several noblemen, to the Abbey of Savigny.

The first record of Amadeus&#x27;s marriage and use of the comital title (&quot;count&quot;, Latin &quot;comes&quot;) comes from a single document dated 22 October 1030. On that date, at Grenoble, the count and his wife, Adelaide, of unknown family, gave the church of Matassine to Cluny. The act was witnessed by one Humbert and his wife Ausilia—who were perhaps Amadeus&#x27;s father and mother—and also by his brother Otto and by the king and queen of Burgundy, Rudolf III and Ermengarda. Although the document of 1030 does not demonstrate that Amadeus and his father both held the rank of count simultaneously, Humbert&#x27;s diploma of 1040 for the Diocese of Aosta was confirmed by his eldest son bearing the title count. On 21 January 1042 Amadeus, Otto and Aymon confirmed another diploma of their father favouring the church of Saint-Chaffre. On 10 June Count Amadeus, Count Humbert and Otto donated the church of Echelles to the church of Saint-Laurence in Grenoble. There is no notice of Amadeus&#x27;s activities for the following decade, and his last action was recorded on 10 December 1051. In this document, he is called &quot;Count of Belley&quot; (&quot;comes Bellicensium&quot;), but it is almost certainly the same Count Amadeus as the son of Humbert I.

According to fourteenth-century sources, Amadeus died shortly after 1051 and was buried in Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne. His son Humbert had predeceased him, but he left behind a son, Aymon, who became Bishop of Belley. He may have had a daughter who married into the family of the Counts of Geneva. He was succeeded by his brother Otto in the countship.

<doc id="68849" wikidata="Q139464" url="?curid=68849" title="Zechariah, father of John the Baptist">
<text>Zechariah was a Jewish priest mentioned in the New Testament and the Quran, and venerated in Christianity and Islam. In the Bible, he is the father of John the Baptist, a priest of the sons of Aaron in the Gospel of Luke (Luke 1:67–79), and the husband of Elizabeth who is a relative of the Virgin Mary (Luke 1:36).

==Biblical account==
According to the Gospel of Luke, during the reign of king Herod, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the course of Abia, whose wife Elizabeth was also of the priestly family of Aaron. The evangelist states that both the parents were righteous before God, since they were &quot;blameless&quot; in observing the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. When the events related in Luke began, their marriage was still childless, because Elizabeth was &quot;barren&quot;, and they were both &quot;well advanced in years&quot; ().

The duties at the temple in Jerusalem alternated between each of the family lines that had descended from those appointed by King David (). Luke states that during the week when it was the duty of Zechariah&#x27;s family line to serve at &quot;the temple of the Lord&quot;, the lot for performing the incense offering had fallen to Zechariah ().

The Gospel of Luke states that while Zechariah ministered at the altar of incense, an angel of the Lord appeared and announced to him that his wife would give birth to a son, whom he was to name John, and that this son would be the forerunner of the Lord (). Citing their advanced age, Zechariah asked with disbelief for a sign whereby he would know the truth of this prophecy. In reply, the angel identified himself as Gabriel, sent especially by God to make this announcement, and added that because of Zechariah&#x27;s doubt he would be struck dumb and &quot;not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed&quot;. Consequently, when he went out to the waiting worshippers in the temple&#x27;s outer courts, he was unable to speak the customary blessing (). The time this occurred, according to theologian Adam C. English, &quot;is September 24, based on computations from the Jewish calendar in accordance with Leviticus 23 regarding the Day of Atonement.&quot;After returning to his house in &quot;Hebron, in the hill &quot;country&quot; of Judah&quot;, his wife Elizabeth conceived. After Elizabeth completed her fifth month of pregnancy, her relative Mary was visited by the same angel, Gabriel. While still a virgin, Gabriel said to her, &quot;Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. &#x27;How will this be,&#x27; Mary asked the angel, &#x27;since I am a virgin?&#x27; The angel answered, &#x27;The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.&#x27;&quot; Joseph, to whom Mary was betrothed, found out that she was pregnant, was at first perplexed at the obviously disturbing news. Because he &quot;was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, &#x27;Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.&#x27; Matthew 24: When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.&quot;

Mary then traveled to visit her relative Elizabeth, having been told by the angel that Elizabeth was in her sixth month of pregnancy. Mary remained about three months before she returned to her own house (;).

Elizabeth gave birth, and on the eighth day, when their son was to be circumcised according to the commandment, her neighbours and relatives assumed that he was to be named after his father. Elizabeth, however, insisted that his name was to be John; so the family then questioned her husband. As soon as Zechariah had written on a writing table: &quot;His name is John&quot;, he regained the power of speech, and blessed &quot;the Lord God of Israel&quot; with a prophecy known as the &quot;Benedictus&quot; or &quot;Song of Zechariah&quot; ().

The child grew up and &quot;waxed strong in spirit&quot;, but remained in the deserts of Judæa until he assumed the ministry that was to earn him the name &quot;John the Baptist&quot; (; ; Matthew 3:1).

==Other Christian traditions==
===Identification with Zechariah from Matthew===
Origen suggested that the Zechariah mentioned in as having been killed between the temple and the altar may be the father of John the Baptist.

===Death===
The Gospel of James, a 2nd-century apocryphal work, recounts that, at the time of the massacre of the Innocents, when King Herod ordered the slaughter of all males under the age of two in an attempt to prevent the prophesied Messiah from coming to Israel, Zechariah refused to divulge the whereabouts of his son (who was in hiding), and he was therefore murdered by Herod&#x27;s soldiers. This account is also present in subsequent Eastern Orthodox tradition.

===Commemoration===
The Catholic Church commemorates him as a saint, along with Elizabeth, on September 23 as it is believed that his temple duty before John the Baptist&#x27;s conception took place on the Day of Atonement. He is also venerated as a prophet in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 5 September. The Armenian Apostolic Church venerates him on September 5th as well, along with his wife Elizabeth. The Eastern Orthodox Church also celebrates the feast day of Zechariah on September 5, together with Elizabeth, who is considered a matriarch. Zechariah and Elizabeth are invoked in several prayers during the Orthodox Mystery of Crowning (Sacrament of Marriage), as the priest blesses the newly married couple, saying &quot;Thou who didst... accept Zechariah and Elizabeth, and didst make their offspring the Forerunner...&quot; and &quot;...bless them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst Zechariah and Elizabeth...&quot;. In the Greek Orthodox calendar, Zechariah and Elizabeth are also commemorated on June 24.

===Relics veneration===
San Zaccaria, Venice claims to house the relics of Zechariah, entombed alongside those of Athanasius of Alexandria. Armenians believe that the Gandzasar monastery in Nagorno-Karabakh contains his relics; however, his relics were also kept in the Hagia Sophia of Constantinople, where they were brought by the &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; Ursus on 4 September, 415.

His relics uncovering is commemorated by Greek Orthodox Church on 11 February, and on 1 December occurs commemoration of his, James and Simeon relics translation in 351, and 25 May is commemoration of their relics discover also in 351.

===Tomb venerated in Byzantine period===
In 2003, a 4th-century inscription on the so-called Tomb of Absalom, a 1st-century monument in Jerusalem, was deciphered as, &quot;This is the tomb of Zachariah, the martyr, the holy priest, the father of John.&quot; This suggests to some scholars that it is the burial place of Zechariah the father of John the Baptist. Professor Gideon Foerster at the Hebrew University states that the inscription tallies with a 6th-century Christian text by a pilgrim named Theodosius which states that Zechariah was buried with Simon the Elder and James the brother of Jesus, and believes that both are authentic. Zias and Puech suggest the inscription may refer to another &#x27;Zekariah&#x27; mentioned by Josephus and the Talmud who was martyred in the time of Vespasian. They also suggest the inscription casts doubt on the tomb being Absalom&#x27;s. Although it was referred to as such in the 1st century, Absalom had lived centuries earlier.

== In Islam ==
Zechariah (Arabic: زكريا &quot;Zakariyya&quot;) is also a prophet in Islam, and is mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an as the father of &quot;Yaḥyā&quot; (John the Baptist). Zechariah is also believed by some Muslims to have been a martyr. An old tradition narrates that Zechariah was sawn in half, in a death which resembles that attributed to Isaiah in &quot;Lives of the Prophets&quot;.

== Unification Church ==
Unificationist theologian Young Oon Kim wrote, and some members of the Unification movement believe, that Zechariah was the father of Jesus, based on the work of Leslie Weatherhead, an English Christian theologian in the liberal Protestant tradition.

*:An alien race discovers that a faulty teleporter has been sending junk onto the surface of Earth instead of the Sun, where scientists from across the world have been studying these &quot;Gifts.&quot; The aliens covertly work with national authorities to recover the futuristic technologies. The last Gift to arrive is the malfunctioning teleporter itself, which the United States attempts to use for a first strike against the USSR.

*:At 100 pages long, the title novella makes up the bulk of the book. The novella chronicles a Culture mission to Earth in the late 1970s, and also serves as a prequel of sorts to &quot;Use of Weapons&quot; by featuring two of that novel&#x27;s characters, Diziet Sma and the drone Skaffen-Amtiskaw. Here, Sma argues for contact with Earth, to try to fix the mess the human species has made of it; another Culture citizen, Linter, goes native, choosing to renounce his Culture body enhancements so as to be more like the locals; and Li, who is a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan, argues that the whole &quot;incontestably neurotic and clinically insane species&quot; should be eradicated with a micro black hole. The ship &quot;Arbitrary&quot; has ideas, and a sense of humour, of its own: &quot;Also while I&#x27;d been away, the ship had sent a request on a postcard to the BBC&#x27;s World Service, asking for &#x27;Mr David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot; for the good ship &quot;Arbitrary&quot; and all who sail in her.&#x27; (This from a machine that could have swamped Earth&#x27;s entire electro-magnetic spectrum with whatever the hell it wanted from somewhere beyond Betelgeuse.) It didn&#x27;t get the request played. The ship thought this was hilarious.&quot;
*&quot;Scratch&quot;. Originally published in &quot;The Fiction Magazine&quot; vol. 6, No. 6, Jul/Aug 1987.
*:A stream-of-consciousness narrative that samples random sections of the future, eventually ending in an abrupt nuclear apocalypse. The following text that opens the story is simultaneously the title and part of the text: &quot;&quot;OR&quot;: The Present and Future of Species &quot;HS&quot; (sic) Considered as The Contents of a Contemporary Popular Record (qv). Report Abstract/Extract Version 4.2 Begins (after this break);&quot;

==Adaptations==

&quot;The State of the Art&quot; was adapted by Paul Cornell for the Afternoon Play slot on BBC Radio 4 and broadcast on 5 March 2009. The adaptation was directed by Nadia Molinari and the main cast was:
*The Ship - Antony Sher
*Diziet Sma - Nina Sosanya
*Dervley Linter - Paterson Joseph
*Li - Graeme Hawley
*Tel - Brigit Forsyth
*Sodel - Conrad Nelson

In late 2009 it was announced that the story &quot;A Gift From the Culture&quot; was in the early stages of being adapted for the cinema by Dominic Murphy, the director of &quot;White Lightnin&#x27;&quot;.

== Reception ==
In 1990 Mike Christie reviewed the collection for &quot;Foundation&quot;. Christie called the collection a &quot;rare success&quot; in the genre of utopian fiction, successfully merging the styles of political utopia and &quot;high-tech sf&quot;. He praises Banks for showing a cast of believable, imperfect characters, who in turn make his utopia - the world of &quot;The Culture&quot; - more realistic.

<text>Otto (; ; /1060) was count of Savoy from around 1051 until his death. Through marriage to Adelaide, the heiress of Ulric Manfred II, he also administered the march of Susa from around 1046 until his death.

==Family==
He was a younger son of Humbert the White-Handed and his wife, Ancilla of Lenzburg. Through Humbert&#x27;s service to the German emperors, the family was granted the counties of Maurienne, Aosta and Sapaudia (Savoy), all at the expense of local bishops or archbishops. Otto inherited the family&#x27;s realms after the death of his brother Amadeus .

In 1046, he married Adelaide, heiress of the march of Susa and county of Turin. They had:

* Peter (d. 1078)
* Amadeus (d. 1080)
* Otto
* Bertha (d. 1087), wife of Henry IV of Germany
* Adelaide (d. 1080), married Rudolf of Swabia

==Rule==
Through his marriage to Adelaide, Otto obtained extensive possessions in northern Italy. Thereafter, the House of Savoy concentrated its expansion efforts towards Italy instead of north of the Alps as it had done before. Savoy&#x27;s lands occupied much of modern Savoy and Piedmont, although several other small states could be found between them. In the 1050s, Otto allowed coins to be minted at Aiguebelle. The archbishop of Vienne, Léger, who had sole right of minting in the region, complained to Pope Leo IX, so Otto forbade further coining at Aiguebelle.

<doc id="68853" wikidata="Q130918" url="?curid=68853" title="Dahlia">
<text>Dahlia ( , ) is a genus of bushy, tuberous, herbaceous perennial plants native to Mexico and Central America. Dahlias are members of the Asteraceae (synonym name: Compositae) family of dicotyledonous plants, its relatives include the sunflower, daisy, chrysanthemum, and zinnia. There are 49 species of dahlia, with flowers in almost every hue (except blue), with hybrids commonly grown as garden plants.

Dahlias were known only to the Aztecs and other southern North American peoples until the Spanish conquest, after which the plants were brought to Europe. The tubers of some varieties are of medicinal and dietary value to humans because they contain inulin, a polymer of the fruit sugar, fructose.

== Description ==

Dahlias are perennial plants with tuberous roots. They are not frost hardy, and require protection from frost if grown in regions with cold winters. While some have herbaceous stems, others have stems which lignify in the absence of secondary tissue and resprout following winter dormancy, allowing further seasons of growth. As members of the family Asteraceae, dahlias have composite flower heads called capitula that are composed of multiple florets arranged in a central disc with surrounding petal-like rays. Each floret is a flower in its own right. The modern name Asteraceae comes from the type genus &quot;Aster&quot; and the Ancient Greek word for &quot;star&quot;, referring to the appearance of a star with surrounding rays.

The stems are leafy, ranging in height from as low as to more than . Flower forms are variable, with one head per stem; these can be as small as in diameter or up to (&quot;dinner plate&quot;). The majority of species do not produce scented flowers. Like most plants that do not attract pollinating insects through scent, they are brightly colored, displaying most hues, with the exception of blue.

The great variety in species results from garden dahlias being octoploids, having eight sets of homologous chromosomes. In addition, dahlias also contain many transposons—genetic pieces that move from place to place upon an allele—which contributes to their manifesting such great diversity.

== Taxonomy==

=== Taxonomic history ===

==== Early history ====
Spaniards reported finding the plants growing in Mexico in 1525, but the earliest known description is by Francisco Hernández, physician to Philip II, who was ordered to visit Mexico in 1570 to study the &quot;natural products of that country&quot;. They were used as a source of food by the indigenous peoples, who both gathered wild specimens and cultivated crops. The indigenous peoples variously identified the plants as &quot;Chichipatl&quot; (Toltecs) and &quot;Acocotle&quot; or &quot;Cocoxochitl&quot; (Aztecs). From Hernandez&#x27;s perception of Nahuatl to Spanish (through various other translations) the word is &quot;water cane&quot;, &quot;water pipe&quot;, &quot;water pipe flower&quot;, &quot;hollow stem flower&quot;, or &quot;cane flower&quot;, all referring to the hollow plant stems.

Hernandez described two varieties of dahlias (the pinwheel-like &quot;Dahlia pinnata&quot; and the huge &quot;Dahlia imperialis&quot;) as well as other medicinal plants of New Spain. Francisco Dominguez, an Hidalgo gentleman who accompanied Hernandez on part of his seven-year study, made a series of drawings to supplement the four volume report. Three of his drawings showed plants with flowers: two resembled the modern bedding dahlia, and one resembled the species &quot;Dahlia merckii&quot;; all displayed a high degree of doubleness. In 1578, a manuscript titled &quot;Nova Plantarum, Animalium et Mineralium Mexicanorum Historia&quot;, was sent back to the Escorial in Madrid. It was translated into Latin by Francisco Ximenes in 1615. In 1640, Francisco Cesi, President of the &quot;Academia dei Lincei&quot; of Rome, bought the Ximenes translation and, after annotating it, published it in 1649–1651 as two volumes, &quot;Rerum Medicarum Novae Hispaniae Thesaurus Seu Nova Plantarium, Animalium et Mineralium Mexicanorum Historia&quot;. The original manuscripts were destroyed in a fire in the mid-1600s.

====European introduction====

In 1787, the French botanist Nicolas-Joseph Thiéry de Menonville, sent to Mexico to steal the cochineal insect valued for its scarlet dye, reported the strangely beautiful flowers he had seen growing in a garden in Oaxaca. In 1789, Vicente Cervantes, director of the Botanical Garden at Mexico City, sent &quot;plant parts&quot; to Abbe Antonio José Cavanilles, director of the Royal Gardens of Madrid. Cavanilles flowered one plant that same year, then the second one a year later. In 1791 he called the new growths &quot;Dahlia&quot; for Anders Dahl. The first plant was called &quot;Dahlia pinnata&quot; after its pinnate foliage; the second, &quot;Dahlia rosea&quot; for its rose-purple color. In 1796, from the parts sent by Cervantes, Cavanilles flowered a third plant, which he named &quot;Dahlia coccinea&quot; for its scarlet color.

In 1798, Cavanilles sent &quot;D. pinnata&quot; seeds to Parma, Italy. That year, the Marchioness of Bute, wife of the Earl of Bute, the English Ambassador to Spain, obtained a few seeds from Cavanilles and sent them to Kew Gardens, where they flowered but were lost after two to three years.
In the following years Madrid sent seeds to Berlin and Dresden in Germany, and to Turin and Thiene in Italy. In 1802, Cavanilles sent tubers of &quot;these three&quot; (&quot;D. pinnata, D. rosea, D. coccinea&quot;) to Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle at University of Montpelier in France, Andre Thouin at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris and Scottish botanist William Aiton at Kew Gardens. That same year, John Fraser, English nurseryman and later botanical collector to the Czar of Russia, brought &quot;D. coccinea&quot; seeds from Paris to the Apothecaries Gardens in England, where they flowered in his greenhouse a year later, providing &quot;Botanical Magazine&quot; with an illustration.
In 1804, a new species, &quot;Dahlia sambucifolia&quot;, was successfully grown at Holland House, Kensington. Whilst in Madrid in 1804, Lady Holland was given either dahlia seeds or tubers by Cavanilles. She sent them back to England, to Lord Holland&#x27;s librarian at Holland House, who successfully raised the plants and produced two double flowers a year later. The plants raised in 1804 did not survive; new stock was brought from France in 1815. In 1824, Lord Holland sent his wife a note containing the following verse:The dahlia you brought to our isle
Your praises for ever shall speak;
Mid gardens as sweet as your smile,
And in colour as bright as your cheek.

In 1805, German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt sent more seeds from Mexico to Aiton in England, Thouin in Paris, and Christoph Friedrich Otto, director of the Berlin Botanical Garden. More significantly, he sent seeds to botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow in Germany. Willdenow now reclassified the rapidly growing number of species, changing the genus from &quot;Dahlia&quot; to &quot;Georgina&quot;; after naturalist Johann Gottlieb Georgi. He combined the Cavanilles species &quot;D. pinnata&quot; and &quot;D. rosea&quot; under the name of &quot;Georgina variabilis&quot;; &quot;D. coccinea&quot; was still held to be a separate species, which he renamed &quot;Georgina coccinea&quot;.

===Classification===

Since 1789 when Cavanilles first flowered the dahlia in Europe, there has been an ongoing effort by many growers, botanists and taxonomists, to determine the development of the dahlia to modern times. At least 85 species have been reported: approximately 25 of these were first reported from the wild; the remainder appeared in gardens in Europe. They were considered hybrids, the results of crossing between previously reported species, or developed from the seeds sent by Humboldt from Mexico in 1805, or perhaps from some other undocumented seeds that had found their way to Europe. Several of these were soon discovered to be identical with earlier reported species, but the greatest number are new varieties. Morphological variation is highly pronounced in the dahlia. William John Cooper Lawrence, who hybridized hundreds of families of dahlias in the 1920s, stated: &quot;I have not yet seen any two plants in the families I have raised which were not to be distinguished one from the other. Constant reclassification of the 85 reported species has resulted in a considerably smaller number of distinct species, as there is a great deal of disagreement today between systematists over classification.

In 1829, all species growing in Europe were reclassified under an all-encompassing name of &quot;D. variabilis, Desf.&quot;, though this is not an accepted name. Through the interspecies cross of the Humboldt seeds and the Cavanilles species, 22 new species were reported by that year, all of which had been classified in different ways by several different taxonomists, creating considerable confusion as to which species was which. As of now Dahlias are classified into 15 different species by botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey.

In 1830 William Smith suggested that all dahlia species could be divided into two groups for color, red-tinged and purple-tinged. In investigating this idea Lawrence determined that with the exception of &quot;D. variabilis&quot;, all dahlia species may be assigned to one of two groups for flower-colour: Group I (ivory-magenta) or Group II (yellow-orange-scarlet).

=== Modern classification ===
The genus &quot;Dahlia&quot; is situated in the Asteroideae subfamily of the Asteraceae, in the Coreopsideae tribe. Within that tribe it is the second largest genus, after &quot;Coreopsis&quot;, and appears as a well defined clade within the Coreopsideae.

=== Subdivision ===

====Infrageneric subdivision ====

Sherff (1955), in the first modern taxonomy described three sections for the 18 species he recognised, &quot;Pseudodendron&quot;, &quot;Epiphytum&quot; and &quot;Dahlia&quot;. By 1969 Sørensen recognised 29 species and four sections by splitting off &quot;Entemophyllon&quot; from section &quot;Dahlia&quot;. By contrast Giannasi (1975) using a phytochemical analysis based on flavonoids, reduced the genus to just two sections, &quot;Entemophyllon&quot; and &quot;Dahlia&quot;, the latter having three subsections, &quot;Pseudodendron&quot;, &quot;Dahlia&quot;, and &quot;Merckii&quot;. Sørensen then issued a further revision in 1980, incorporating subsection &quot;Merckii&quot; in his original section &quot;Dahlia&quot;.
When he described two new species in the 1980s (&quot;Dahlia tubulata&quot; and &quot;D. congestifolia&quot;), he placed them within his existing sections. A further species, &quot;Dahlia sorensenii&quot; was added by Hansen and Hjerting in (1996). 
At the same time they demonstrated that &quot;Dahlia pinnata&quot; should more properly be designated &quot;D. x pinnata&quot;. &quot;D. x pinnata&quot; was shown to actually be a variant of &quot;D. sorensenii&quot; that had acquired hybrid qualities before it was introduced to Europe in the sixteenth century and formally named by Cavanilles. The original wild &quot;D. pinnata&quot; is presumed extinct. Further species continue to be described, Saar (2003) describing 35 species. However separation of the sections on morphological, cytologal and biocemical criteria has not been entirely satisfactory.

To date these sectional divisions have not been fully supported phylogenetically, which demonstrate only section &quot;Entemophyllon&quot; as a distinct sectional clade. The other major grouping is the core &quot;Dahlia&quot; clade (CDC), which includes most of the section &quot;Dahlia&quot;. The remainder of the species occupy what has been described as the variable root clade (VRC) which includes the small section &quot;Pseudodendron&quot; but also the monotypic section &quot;Epiphytum&quot; and a number of species from within section &quot;Dahlia&quot;. Outside of these three clades lie &quot;D. tubulata&quot; and &quot;D. merckii&quot; as a polytomy.

Horticulturally the sections retain some usage, section &quot;Pseudodendron&quot; being referred to as &#x27;Tree Dahlias&#x27;, &quot;Epiphytum&quot; as the &#x27;Vine Dahlia&#x27;. The remaining two herbaceous sections being distinguished by their pinnules, opposing (&quot;Dahlia&quot;) or alternating (&quot;Entemophyllon&quot;).

=====Species=====

There are currently 42 accepted species in the genus &quot;Dahlia&quot; but new species continue to be described.

===Etymology===
The naming of the plant itself has long been a subject of some confusion. Many sources state that the name &quot;Dahlia&quot; was bestowed by the pioneering Swedish botanist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus to honor his late student, Anders Dahl, author of &quot;Observationes Botanicae&quot;. However, Linnaeus died in 1778, more than eleven years before the plant was introduced into Europe in 1789, so while it is generally agreed that the plant was named in 1791 in honor of Dahl, who had died two years before, Linnaeus could not have been the one who did so. It was probably Abbe Antonio Jose Cavanilles, Director of the Royal Gardens of Madrid, who should be credited with the attempt to scientifically define the genus, since he not only received the first specimens from Mexico in 1789, but named the first three species that flowered from the cuttings.

Regardless of who bestowed it, the name was not so easily established. In 1805, German botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow, asserting that the genus &quot;Dahlia&quot; Thunb. (published a year after Cavanilles&#x27;s genus and now considered a synonym of &quot;Trichocladus&quot;) was more widely accepted, changed the plants&#x27; genus from &quot;Dahlia&quot; to &quot;Georgina&quot; (after the German-born naturalist Johann Gottlieb Georgi, a professor at the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg, Russia). He also reclassified and renamed the first three species grown, and identified, by Cavanilles. It was not until 1810, in a published article, that he officially adopted the Cavanilles&#x27;s original designation of &quot;Dahlia&quot;. However, the name &quot;Georgina&quot; still persisted in Germany for the next few decades. In Russian, it is still named Georgina ().

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Dahlia&quot; is found predominantly in Mexico, but some species are found ranging as far south as northern South America. &quot;D. australis&quot; occurs at least as far south as southwestern Guatemala, while &quot;D. coccinea&quot; and &quot;D. imperialis&quot; also occur in parts of Central America and northern South America. &quot;Dahlia&quot; is a genus of the uplands and mountains, being found at elevations between , in what has been described as a &quot;pine-oak woodland&quot; vegetative zone. Most species have limited ranges scattered throughout many mountain ranges in Mexico 

== Ecology ==
The most common pollinators are bees and small beetles.

===Pests and diseases===
Slugs and snails are serious pests in some parts of the world, particularly in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms and foliage. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), red spider mite (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and capsid bugs (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, grey mould (&quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (&quot;Entyloma calendulae&quot; f. &quot;dahliae&quot;), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, common swift, ghost moth and large yellow underwing.

==Cultivation==
Dahlias grow naturally in climates that do not experience frost (the tubers are hardy to USDA Zone 8). Consequently they are not adapted to withstand sub-zero temperatures. However, their tuberous nature enables them to survive periods of dormancy, and this characteristic means that gardeners in temperate climates with frosts can grow dahlias successfully, provided the tubers are lifted from the ground and stored in cool yet frost-free conditions during the winter. Planting the tubers quite deep () also provides some protection. When in active growth, modern dahlia hybrids perform most successfully in well-watered yet free-draining soils, in situations receiving plenty of sunlight. Taller cultivars usually require some form of staking as they grow, and all garden dahlias need deadheading regularly, once flowering commences.

=== Horticultural classification ===
Horticulturally the garden dahlia is usually treated as the cultigen &quot;D. variabilis&quot; hort., which while being responsible for thousands of cultivars has an obscure taxonomic status.

==== History ====
The inappropriate term &quot;D. variabilis&quot; is often used to describe the cultivars of &quot;Dahlia&quot; since the correct parentage remains obscure, but probably involves &quot;Dahlia coccinea&quot;. In 1846 the Caledonia Horticultural Society of Edinburgh offered a prize of 2,000 pounds to the first person succeeding in producing a blue dahlia. This has to date not been accomplished. While dahlias produce anthocyanin, an element necessary for the production of the blue, to achieve a true blue color in a plant, the anthocyanin delphinidin needs six hydroxyl groups. To date, dahlias have only developed five, so the closest that breeders have come to achieving a &quot;blue&quot; specimen are variations of mauve, purples and lilac hues.

By the beginning of the twentieth century, a number of different types were recognised. These terms were based on shape or colour, and the National Dahlia Society included cactus, pompon, single, show and fancy in its 1904 guide. Many national societies developed their own classification systems until 1962 when the International Horticultural Congress agreed to develop an internationally recognised system at its Brussels meeting that year, and subsequently in Maryland in 1966. This culminated in the 1969 publication of &quot;The International Register of Dahlia Names&quot; by the Royal Horticultural Society which became the central registering authority.

This system depended primarily on the visibility of the central disc, whether it was open-centred or whether only ray florets were apparent centrally (double bloom). The double-bloom cultivars were then subdivided according to the way in which they were folded along their longitudinal axis: flat, involute (curled inwards) or revolute (curling backwards). If the end of the ray floret was split, they were considered fimbriated. Based on these characteristics, nine groups were defined plus a tenth miscellaneous group for any cultivars not fitting the above characteristics. Fimbriated dahlias were added in 2004, and two further groups (Single and Double orchid) in 2007. The last group to be added, Peony, first appeared in 2012.

In many cases the bloom diameter was then used to further label certain groups from miniature to giant. This practice was abandoned in 2012.

==== Modern system (RHS) ====
There are now more than 57,000 registered cultivars,
which are officially registered through the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). The official register is &quot;The International Register of Dahlia Names 1969&quot; (1995 reprint) which is updated by annual supplements. The original 1969 registry published about 14,000 cultivars adding a further 1700 by 1986 and in 2003 there were 18,000. Since then about a hundred new cultivars are added annually.
;Flower type
The official RHS classification lists fourteen groups, grouped by flower type, together with the abbreviations used by the RHS;

;Flower size
Earlier versions of the registry subdivided some groups by flower size. Groups 4, 5, 8 and 9 were divided into five subgroups (A to E) from Giant to Miniature, and Group 6 into two subgroups, Small and Miniature. Dahlias were then described by Group and Subgroup, e.g. 5(d) ‘Ace Summer Sunset’. Some Dahlia Societies have continued this practice, but this is neither official nor standardised. As of 2013 The RHS uses two size descriptors

* Dwarf Bedder (Dw.B.) – not usually exceeding in height, e.g. &#x27;Preston Park&#x27; (&quot;Sin/DwB&quot;)
* Lilliput dahlias (Lil) – not usually exceeding in height, with single, semi-double or double florets up to in diameter. (&quot;baby&quot; or &quot;top-mix&quot; dahlias), e.g. &#x27;Harvest Tiny Tot&#x27; (&quot;Misc/Lil&quot;)

Sizes can range from tiny micro dahlias with flowers less than 50&quot; &quot;mm to giants that are over 250&quot; &quot;mm in diameter. The groupings listed here are from the New Zealand Society:

* Giant-flowered cultivars have blooms with a diameter over 250 mm.
* Large-flowered cultivars have blooms with a diameter of 200–250 mm.
* Medium-flowered cultivars have blooms with a diameter of 155–350 mm.
* Small-flowered cultivars have blooms with a diameter of 115–155 mm.
* Miniature-flowered cultivars have blooms with a diameter of 50–115 mm.
* Pompom-flowered cultivars have blooms with a diameter less than 50 mm.

In addition to the official classification and the terminology used by various dahlia societies, individual horticulturalists use a wide range of other descriptions, such as &#x27;Incurved&#x27; and abbreviations in their catalogues, such as CO for Collarette.

==== Branding ====

Some plant growers include their brand name in the cultivar name. Thus Fides (part of the Dümmen Orange Group) in the Netherlands developed a series of cultivars which they named the Dahlinova series, for example Dahlinova &#x27;Carolina Burgundy&#x27;. These are Group 10 Miscellaneous in the RHS classification scheme.

===Double dahlias===
In 1805, several new species were reported with red, purple, lilac, and pale yellow coloring, and the first true double flower was produced in Belgium. One of the more popular concepts of dahlia history, and the basis for many different interpretations and confusion, is that all the original discoveries were single-flowered types, which, through hybridization and selective breeding, produced double forms. Many of the species of dahlias then, and now, have single-flowered blooms. &quot;D. coccinea&quot;, the third dahlia to bloom in Europe, was a single. But two of the three drawings of dahlias by Dominguez, made in Mexico between 1570 and 1577, showed definite characteristics of doubling. In the early days of the dahlia in Europe, the word &quot;double&quot; simply designated flowers with more than one row of petals. The greatest effort was now directed to developing improved types of double dahlias.

During the years 1805 to 1810 several people claimed to have produced a double dahlia. In 1805 Henry C. Andrews made a drawing of such a plant in the collection of Lady Holland, grown from seedlings sent that year from Madrid. Like other doubles of the time it did not resemble the doubles of today. The first modern double, or full double, appeared in Belgium; M. Donckelaar, Director of the Botanic Garden at Louvain, selected plants for that characteristic, and within a few years secured three fully double forms. By 1826 double varieties were being grown almost exclusively, and there was very little interest in the single forms. Up to this time all the so-called double dahlias had been purple, or tinged with purple, and it was doubted if a variety untinged with that color was obtainable.

In 1843, scented single forms of dahlias were first reported in Neu Verbass, Austria. &quot;D. crocea&quot;, a fragrant variety grown from one of the Humboldt seeds, was probably interbred with the single &quot;D. coccinea&quot;. A new scented species would not be introduced until the next century when the &quot;D. coronata&quot; was brought from Mexico to Germany in 1907.

The exact date the dahlia was introduced in the United States is uncertain. One of the first dahlias in the USA may have been the &quot;D. coccinea speciosissima&quot; grown by William Leathe, of Cambridgeport, near Boston, around 1929. According to Edward Sayers, &quot;it attracted much admiration, and at that time was considered a very elegant flower, it was however soon eclipsed by that splendid scarlet, the Countess of Liverpool&quot;. However, nine cultivars were already listed in the catalog from Thornburn, 1825. And even earlier reference can be found in a catalogue from the Linnaean Botanical Garden, New York, 1820, that includes one scarlet, one purple, and two double orange Dahlias for sale.

Sayers stated that &quot;No person has done more for the introduction and advancement of the culture of
the Dahlia than George C. Thorburn, of New York, who yearly flowers many thousand plants at his place at Hallet&#x27;s Cove, near Harlaem. The show there in the flowering season is a rich treat for the lovers of floriculture : for almost every variety can be seen growing in two large blocks or masses which lead from the road to the dwelling-house, and form a complete field of the Dahlia as a foreground to the house. Mr. T. Hogg, William Read, and many other well-known florists have also contributed much in the vicinity of New York, to the introduction of the Dahlia. Indeed so general has become the taste that almost every garden has its show of the Dahlia in the season.&quot; In Boston too there were many collections, a collection from the Messrs Hovey of Cambridgeport was also mentioned.

In 1835 Thomas Bridgeman, published a list of 160 double dahlias in his &quot;Florist&#x27;s Guide&quot;. 60 of the choicest were supplied by Mr. G. C. Thornburn of Astoria, New York, who got most of them from contacts in the UK. Not a few of them had taken prizes &quot;at the English and American exhibitions&quot;.

===&quot;Stars of the Devil&quot;===
In 1872 J. T. van der Berg of Utrecht in the Netherlands received a shipment of seeds and plants from a friend in Mexico. The entire shipment was badly rotted and appeared to be ruined, but van der Berg examined it carefully and found a small piece of root that seemed alive. He planted and carefully tended it; it grew into a plant that he identified as a dahlia. He made cuttings from the plant during the winter of 1872–1873. This was an entirely different type of flower, with rich, red color and a high degree of doubling. In 1874 van der Berg catalogued it for sale, calling it &quot;Dahlia juarezii&quot; to honor Mexican President Benito Pablo Juarez, who had died the year before, and described it as &quot;...equal to the beautiful color of the red poppy. Its form is very outstanding and different in every respect of all known dahlia flowers.&quot;

This plant has perhaps had a greater influence on the popularity of the modern dahlia than any other. Called &quot;Les Etoiles du Diable&quot; (Stars of the Devil) in France and &quot;Cactus dahlia&quot; elsewhere, the edges of its petals rolled backwards, rather than forward, and this new form revolutionized the dahlia world. It was thought to be a distinct mutation since no other plant that resembled it could be found in the wild. Today it is assumed that &quot;D. juarezii&quot; had, at one time, existed in Mexico and subsequently disappeared. Nurserymen in Europe crossbred this plant with dahlias discovered earlier; the results became the progenitors of all modern dahlia hybrids today.

=== Award of Garden Merit (RHS) ===

As of 2015, 124 dahlia cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit, including:
* &quot;Bednall beauty&quot; 
* &quot;Bishop of Llandaff&quot;
* &quot;Clair de lune&quot; 
* &quot;David Howard&quot;
* &quot;Ellen Huston&quot; 
* &quot;Fascination&quot; 
* &quot;Gallery Art Deco&quot; 
* &quot;Gallery Art Nouveau&quot; 
* &quot;Glorie van Heemstede&quot; 
* &quot;Honka&quot;
* &quot;Moonfire&quot;
* &quot;Twyning&#x27;s After Eight&quot;
==Uses==
The Aztecs used dahlias to treat epilepsy, and employed the long hollow stem of the &quot;D. imperialis&quot; for water pipes. Europeans attempted to introduce the tubers as a food crop, but this was unpopular.

The dahlia is considered one of the native ingredients in Oaxacan cuisine; several cultivars are still grown especially for their large, sweet potato-like tubers. Dacopa, an intense mocha-tasting extract from the roasted tubers, is used to flavor beverages throughout Central America.

=== Medicine ===
In Europe and America, prior to the discovery of insulin in 1923, diabetics—as well as consumptives—were often given a substance called &quot;Atlantic starch&quot; or &quot;diabetic sugar&quot;, derived from inulin, a naturally occurring form of fruit sugar, extracted from dahlia tubers. Inulin is still used in clinical tests for kidney functionality.

==In culture==
Founded in 1936, the Bloemencorso Zundert is the largest flower parade in the world entirely made by volunteers using the dahlia. The parade takes place on the first Sunday of September in Zundert, Netherlands. The floats are large artworks made of steel wire, cardboard, papier-mâché and flowers. In the Bloemencorso Zundert, mostly dahlias are used to decorate the objects and it takes thousands of them just to cover one float. Around 8 million dahlias are needed for the entire corso. Of these, around 6 million are cultivated in Zundert.

The dahlia was declared the national flower of Mexico in 1963.

<doc id="68855" wikidata="Q139792" url="?curid=68855" title="Zacchaeus">
<text>Zacchaeus (sometimes spelled Zaccheus; , &quot;&quot;; , &quot;pure, innocent&quot;) was a chief tax-collector at Jericho in the Bible. He is known primarily for his faith in climbing a sycamore tree to see Jesus and also his generosity in giving away half of all he possessed. 

A descendant of Abraham, he was an example of Jesus&#x27;s personal, earthly mission to bring salvation to the lost. Tax collectors were despised as traitors (working for the Roman Empire, not for their Jewish community), and as being corrupt. His story is found in the Gospel of Luke.

Because the lucrative production and export of balsam was centered in Jericho, his position would have carried both importance and wealth. In the account, he arrived before the crowd who were later to meet with Jesus, who was passing through Jericho on his way to Jerusalem. He was short in stature and so was unable to see Jesus through the crowd (Luke 19:3). Zacchaeus then ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree along Jesus&#x27;s path. When Jesus reached the spot he looked up at the sycamore tree (actually a sycamore-fig &quot;Ficus sycomorus&quot;), addressed Zacchaeus by name, and told him to come down, for he intended to visit his house. The crowd was shocked that Jesus, a religious teacher/prophet, would sully himself by being a guest of a sinner.

==Later traditions==

At Er-riha (Jericho) there is a large, venerable looking square tower, which by tradition is named the House of Zacchaeus.

Clement of Alexandria refers once to Zacchaeus in a way which could be read as suggesting that some identified him with apostle Matthew or Matthias. However, Luke indicates that Matthias was with Jesus in the beginning since the baptism of John (Acts 1:21–22). 
Because John preached the giving away of one&#x27;s excess possessions in Luke 3:7–14, this could explain the generosity of Little Zacchaeus. John also told us that later, many of Jesus&#x27; disciples turned back and no longer followed him (). The later Apostolic Constitutions identify &quot;Zacchaeus the Publican&quot; as the first bishop of Caesarea (7.46).

Medieval legend identified Zacchaeus with Saint Amadour, and held him to be the founder of the French sanctuary, Rocamadour.

==Liturgical practices==

In Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the Gospel account of Zacchaeus is read on the penultimate Sunday of the Pre-Lenten Season preceding the start Great Lent, for which reason that Sunday is known as &quot;Zacchaeus Sunday&quot;. It is the first commemoration of a new Paschal cycle. The account was chosen to open the Lenten season because of two exegetical aspects: Jesus&#x27;s call to Zacchaeus to come down from the tree (symbolizing the divine call to humility), and Zacchaeus&#x27;s subsequent repentance. On years when Pascha, and hence Lent, falls very early the Sunday of the Canaanite woman is dropped and the Sunday of Zaccheaus falls immediately before Great Lent. However in some Eastern churches of the Greek/Byzantine tradition, Zacchaeus Sunday is instead dropped, and does not form part of the Lental cycle for that year. In the Russian tradition Zacchaeus Sunday always immediately precedes Great Lent having exchanged places with the Sunday of the Canaanite Woman. 

In Western Christianity, the gospel pericope concerning Zacchaeus is the reading for a Dedication of a Church or its anniversary. In Southern Bavaria, a red banner with a white cross may be flown outside a Church on its anniversary, which is consequently called the Zacchaeus flag.

<doc id="68856" wikidata="Q1095" url="?curid=68856" title="Limburg (Belgium)">
<text>Limburg (, ; or ; , ), also known as Belgian Limburg, is a province in Belgium. It is the easternmost of the five Dutch-speaking provinces that together form the Region of Flanders, which is one of the three main political and cultural sub-divisions of modern-day Belgium. As of January 2024, Limburg had a population of 0.9 million.

Limburg is located west of the Meuse (), which separates it from the similarly-named Dutch province of Limburg. To the south it shares a border with the French-speaking province of Liège, with which it also has historical ties. To the north and west are the old territories of the Duchy of Brabant. Today these are the Flemish provinces of Flemish Brabant and Antwerp to the west, and the Dutch province of North Brabant to the north. Historically Belgian Limburg is roughly equivalent to the Dutch-speaking part of the secular lordship of the medieval Prince-Bishopric of Liège, which was dominated by the County of Loon.

The province of Limburg has an area of which comprises three arrondissements (&quot;arrondissementen&quot; in Dutch) containing 44 municipalities. Among these municipalities are the current capital Hasselt, and other large towns including Sint-Truiden, Genk, and Tongeren. Tongeren is the only Roman city in the province, and regarded as the oldest city of Belgium.

The municipality of Voeren is geographically detached from Limburg and the rest of Flanders, with the Netherlands to the north and the Walloon province of Liège to the south. This municipality was established by the municipal reform of 1977, and on 1 January 2008, with its six villages, it had a total population of 4,207. Its total area is .

==Name==
The name Limburg was not applied to the territory of Belgian Limburg until the 19th century. Instead, the territory broadly coincides with that of the medieval County of Loon, which was one of the main parts of the Prince-bishopric of Liège. In the late-18th century, following the French Revolution and the subsequent French Campaign in the Low Countries, the region became part of the newly created Lower Meuse Department of the French First Republic (later the First French Empire), along with a significant part of what would become Dutch Limburg.

After the defeat of the French empire and the Congress of Vienna in 1815, this department was reconstituted into the Province of Limburg as part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The new name had its own medieval history, being associated with the extinct Duchy of Limburg, which had its capital at nearby Limbourg-sur-Vesdre, now in the French-speaking Belgian province of Liège. The new Dutch monarchy chose this name because it desired to recreate the prestigious old title in a new Duchy of Limburg. 

Because of the Belgian revolution in 1830, this province of Limburg was divided in 1839 by the Treaty of London; the western portion being recognised as a province of the newly formed Kingdom of Belgium, while the eastern portion remained part of the Netherlands as the modern Dutch Province of Limburg. Both parts retained the name they had been given by the Dutch monarchy after the defeat of France.

==History==
The first wave of people who brought farming and pottery technology from the Middle East to northern Europe was the LBK culture, which originated in central Europe and reached a geographical limit in the fertile southern Haspengouw part of Limburg about 5000 BC, only to die out about 4000 BC. A later wave of people from this farming culture, the Michelsburg culture, arrived from central Europe about 3500 BC and shared a similar fate. Pottery technology had however apparently been taken up by local tribes of the Swifterbant culture, who remained present throughout.

The area became permanently agricultural only in the Bronze Age with the Urnfield culture around 1200 BC, followed by the possibly related Halstatt and La Tène material cultures, which are generally associated with Celts. Under these cultures the population increased in the region, and it is also during this period that Indo-European languages are thought to have arrived. Although these new technologies and languages once again arrived from the direction of Germany, they can partly be traced back to peoples who arrived in Europe, not from the Middle East, but from the direction of Ukraine and southern Russia around 2000 BC. This migration had a similar impact across the continent.

Caesar gave the first surviving written description of the area around 55 BC and described its people as the &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot;. He described them as allies of the Belgae and Treveri, and reported that they had ancestral links with their neighbours on the east side of the Rhine. Somewhat earlier, we know from surviving fragments of his work that Poseidonius had already mentioned these same &quot;Germani&quot;, saying that they roasted meat in separate joints, and drank milk and unmixed wine. Caesar noted several peoples within the &quot;Germani&quot; group, the most important of which were the Eburones who fought against Julius Caesar under their leaders Ambiorix and Cativolcus. Apart from the &quot;Germani&quot;, somewhere to the west of the Eburones (possibly outside Limburg) were the Aduatuci, who Caesar reported to be the descendants of the Cimbri and Teutones who had migrated around Europe some generations before Caesar.

Under Roman imperial rule, the area around Limburg was known as the &quot;city&quot; (&quot;civitas&quot;) the Tungri. Tacitus reported that these Tungri were the same as the earlier &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot;, and noted that the use of the name &quot;Germani&quot; had been expanded in Roman times to cover many peoples in Germany east of the Rhine. The Tungri are generally accepted to have been speakers of a Germanic language, but modern historians disagree over the extent to which they descend from new immigrants who came from over the Rhine after Caesar. Notably, the Tungri participated on the Roman side in the revolt of the Batavi against Roman rule, which was a major event in this region. In the north of Limburg during Roman times lived the Texandri.
The site of the fort where Caesar&#x27;s soldiers encamped was called Aduatuca. This was apparently a general word for a fort, associated not only with the Eburones, but also the Aduatuci, and the later Tungri. The Roman city established in Belgian Limburg was referred to as &quot;Aduatuca Tungrorum&quot; meaning &quot;Aduatuca of the Tungri&quot;. Today this has become &quot;Tongeren&quot;, in the southeast of Belgian Limburg, and it was the capital of a Roman administrative region called the &quot;Civitas Tungrorum&quot;. Under the Romans, the Tungri &quot;civitas&quot; was initially a part of Gallia Belgica. However, it was later split out with the more militarized border regions towards the Rhine, to become Germania Inferior, which was later converted into Germania Secunda.

In late Roman and early medieval times, the northern or &quot;Kempen&quot; part of Belgian Limburg became depopulated and uncultivated. This area, still known then by its Roman name as Texandria, was settled by incoming Salian Franks from the north, who were under pressure from Saxons. The southern or &quot;Haspengouw&quot; part of Belgian Limburg was an important agricultural region and remained more heavily Romanised, and eventually became a core land of the Frankish empires. 

===Middle Ages===

By the 9th century, the Frankish Carolingian dynasty, who had lands in and around Belgian Limburg, ruled an empire that included much of Western Europe. The Franks originally had several smaller kingdoms ruling each of the old Roman civitates (&quot;cities&quot;), but under the Merovingians one empire formed, which was divided each generation among family members. In the period around 881 and 882 the areas along the Maas and in the Haspengouw were plundered by Vikings, who established a base on the Maas river. Early Christianity was established first in the Romanised southern parts of Limburg, around Tongeren, and missionaries went north from there to convert the Franks. The church capital moved from the Roman capital Tongeren to nearby Maastricht, and then Liège. This was the area of activity of St Servatius, and later, Lambert of Maastricht.

Limburg was part of the central Austrasian kingdom of the Franks which lay between the parts which would become France and Germany. The divisions of the Frankish empire were eventually fixed in the 9th century when this Middle Kingdom came to be known as Lotharingia after its first king, Lothair II. During the 10th-century the region slowly came under the permanent control of Eastern Francia, which was to become the Holy Roman Empire. Under the Ottonians the archbishops became responsible for a very large territory stretching up to the delta of the river Maas. Another early saint in the south of Limburg was St Trudo, whose name survives in one of the major towns in southern Limburg, Saint Truiden.

Belgian Limburg corresponds closely to the medieval territory of the County of Loon (French &quot;Looz&quot;) which starts to appear in records only in the 11th century. This county originally centred on the fortified town of Borgloon, which was originally simply known as Loon. Although the exact details are unclear today, from an early time Loon was subservient, not only spiritually but also politically, to the powerful Prince-Bishopric of Liège. When the male line of the counts ended with Louis IV in 1336, the bishops began to take direct control, and the last claimant to that inheritance, Arnold of Rumigny, count of Chiny gave up his claim.

===Modern history===

Loon, and the rest of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, were not joined politically with the rest of what would become Belgium until the French Revolution. Nevertheless, in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries the population of Loon was constantly and badly affected by the large-scale international wars of the neighbouring Spanish Netherlands and Dutch Republic, including the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the Nine Years&#x27; War, the War of the Spanish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years&#x27; War, and even the Brabant Revolution. During this period the region&#x27;s episcopal government was often unable to maintain law and order, and the economy of the area was often desperately bad, affected by plundering soldiers and gangs of thieves such as the &quot;Bokkenrijders&quot;. Nevertheless, the population contained strongly conservative Catholic elements, and not only supported the conservative Brabant revolution, but also rebelled unsuccessfully against the revolutionary French regime in the Peasants&#x27; War of 1798.

The modern Limburg region, containing the Belgian and Dutch provinces of that name, were first united within one province while under the power of revolutionary France, and later the Napoleonic empire, but then under the name of the French department of the Lower Meuse (Maas). After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, a united Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed, containing modern Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. While it kept many of the French provincial boundaries, the first king, William I, insisted that the name be changed to the &quot;Province of Limburg&quot;, based on the name of the medieval Duchy of Limburg. The only part of Belgian or Dutch Limburg which was really in the Duchy of Limburg is the extreme east of Voeren, the villages of Teuven and Remersdaal, and these only became part of Belgian Limburg in 1977.

After the Belgian Revolution of 1830, the province of Limburg was at first almost entirely under Belgian rule, but the status of both Limburg and Luxembourg became unclear. During the &quot;Ten days campaign&quot;, 2–12 August 1831, Dutch armies entered Belgium and took control of several Belgian cities in order to negotiate from a stronger position. Several Belgian militias and armies were easily defeated including the Belgian Army of the Meuse near Hasselt, on 8 August. The French and British intervened, leading to a ceasefire. 
After a Conference in London, they signed a treaty in 1839 and established after that both Limburg and Luxemburg would be split between the two states. That happened; Limburg was split into so-called &quot;Dutch&quot; Limburg and &quot;Belgian&quot; Limburg.

===Twentieth century===
Belgian Limburg became officially Flemish when Belgium was divided into language areas in 1962. In the case of Voeren, surrounded by French speaking parts of Belgium, and having a significant population of French speakers, this was not without controversy.

Only in 1967, the Catholic Church created a diocese of Hasselt, separate from the diocese of Liège.

==Geography==

The centre of Belgian Limburg is crossed east to west by the river Demer and the Albert Canal, which run similar paths. The Demer&#x27;s drainage basin covers most of the central and southern part of the province, except for the southeastern corner, where the Jeker (in French: &quot;(le) Geer&quot;) runs past Tongeren and into the river Maas (in French: &quot;(la) Meuse&quot;) at Maastricht.

The eastern border of the province corresponds to the western bank of the Maas, which originates in France. Its drainage basin includes not only the Jeker but most of the northern part of Belgian Limburg.

The south of the province is the northern part of the Hesbaye region (in Dutch: &quot;Haspengouw&quot;), with fertile soils, farming and fruit-growing, and historically the higher population density. The hilliness increases in the southeast, including the detached Voeren part of Limburg.

North of the river Demer and the Albert Canal is part of the Campine (in Dutch: &quot;(de) Kempen&quot;) region, with sandy soils, heathlands, and forests. This area was relatively less populated, until coal-mining started in the 19th century, attracting immigration from other areas, including Mediterranean countries.

==Language==

As in all Flemish provinces, the official language is Dutch, but two municipalities, Herstappe and Voeren, are to a certain extent allowed to use French to communicate with their citizens. They are two of the municipalities with language facilities in Belgium.

Several variations of Limburgish are also still actively used, these being a diverse group of dialects which share features in common with both German and Dutch. &quot;Limburg mijn Vaderland&quot; is the official anthem of both Belgian and Dutch Limburg, and has versions in various dialects of Limburgish, varying from accents closer to standard Dutch in the west, to more distinctive dialects near the Maas. Outside of the two Limburgs related dialects or languages are found stretched out towards the nearby Ruhr valley region of Germany. And there are also related dialects around Aachen in Germany as well as in the extreme northeast of the mainly French-speaking province of Liège.

As in the rest of Flanders a high level of multi-lingualism is found in the population.

Limburg is close to Germany and Wallonia, and because of the natural political, cultural and economics links, French and German have long been important second languages in the area.

English has also now become a language which is widely understood and used in business and cultural activities, and is supplanting French in this regard.

Veldeke, the medieval property of the family of Hendrik van Veldeke, was near Hasselt, along the river Demer, to the west of Kuringen.

==Economy==

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 28.7 billion € in 2018. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 29,000 € or 96% of the EU27 average in the same year.

In the economic field tourism is being actively promoted with publicized attractions including Limburg&#x27;s claim to be a &quot;Bicycle Paradise&quot; (&quot;Fietsparadijs&quot;). There&#x27;s also the possibility to walk in nature reserves, such as the &quot;High Kempen National Park&quot;.

In the south, the Haspengouw (Hesbaye), predominantly situated in Limburg, is now Belgium&#x27;s major area for fruit growing. In Limburg more than 50% of Belgium&#x27;s fruit production is grown.

Coal mining has been an important industry in the 20th century, but has now ended in this province. Nevertheless, it has laid the basis for a more complex modern economy and community. In the 20th century, Limburg became a centre for the secondary sector, attracting Ford, who had a major production centre in Genk that closed in December 2014, and the electronics company Philips, who had a major operation in Kiewit.

Many areas such as Genk continue to have a lot of heavy and chemical industry, but emphasis has moved towards encouraging innovation. The old Philips plant is now the site of a Research Campus, and the Hasselt University in Diepenbeek has a science park attached to it. Similarly, the site of the coal mine in Genk is now Thor Park, where Energyville, a research hub of the KU Leuven, VITO, imec, and UHasselt.

The region today promotes itself as a centre for trade in the heart of industrialised Europe. It is part of the Meuse-Rhine Euroregion, which represents a partnership between this province and neighbouring provinces in Germany, the Netherlands and Wallonia.

==Culture==
Essential elements in Limburgian culture are:

*Music (many places have their own brass-band; from 1965 until 1981 yearly an internationally known jazz- en rockfestival took place at Bilzen, before it moved outside of Limburg to Werchter, where it is still held, by now as &quot;Rock Werchter&quot;). Another well known yearly music festival is Pukkelpop in Hasselt.
*Religion predominantly Roman Catholic

(Division 1), Lommel United (Division 2); K. Patro Eisden Maasmechelen and KSK Hasselt (Division 3). K.R.C. Genk have won the national championship four times. Motocross is also popular, with four former world champions in this sport coming from Belgian Limburg; together they won 20 world championships.

<text>The Player of Games is a science fiction novel by Scottish writer Iain M. Banks, first published in 1988. It was the second published Culture novel. A film version was planned by Pathé in the 1990s, but was abandoned.

==Plot==
Jernau Morat Gurgeh, a famously skillful player of board games and other similar contests, lives on Chiark Orbital (space station), and is bored with his successful life. The Culture&#x27;s Special Circumstances (SC) inquires about his willingness to participate in a long journey but won&#x27;t explain further unless Gurgeh agrees to participate. While he is considering this offer, one of his drone friends, Mawhrin-Skel, which had been ejected from SC due to its unstable personality, convinces him to cheat in one of his games in an attempt to win in an unprecedentedly perfect fashion. The attempt fails, but Mawhrin-Skel uses its recording of the event to blackmail Gurgeh into accepting the offer with the condition that Mawhrin-Skel be admitted back into SC.

Gurgeh spends the next two years travelling to the Empire of Azad in the Small Magellanic Cloud, where a complex game (also named Azad) is used to determine social rank and political status. The game itself is sufficiently subtle and complex that a player&#x27;s tactics reflect their own political and philosophical outlook. By the time he arrives, he has grasped the game but is unsure how he will measure up against opponents who have been studying it for their entire lives.

Gurgeh lands on the Empire&#x27;s home planet of Eä, accompanied by another drone, Flere-Imsaho. As a Culture citizen, he naturally plays with a style markedly different from his opponents, many of whom stack the odds against him one way or another, including by forming backroom agreements to cooperate against him (which is allowed by the game&#x27;s rules) and placing bets on the game requiring the castration of the loser. As he advances through the tournament he is matched against increasingly powerful Azad politicians, and ultimately the Emperor himself in the final round. 

The final contests take place on Echronedal, the Fire Planet, which undergoes a periodic natural conflagration fueled by native plants that produce huge amounts of oxygen. The final game is timed to end when the flames engulf the castle where the event takes place, symbolically renewing the Empire by fire. However, faced with defeat, the Emperor&#x27;s men destroy the castle&#x27;s fire-suppression systems and start a closer fire front, as the Emperor places cards representing this within the game. With the castle surrounded by fire, the Emperor attempts to kill Gurgeh. Instead, the Emperor is killed by a shot from his own weapon, deflected by Flere-Imsaho, who later refuses to tell Gurgeh if it was coincidental after rescuing him from the fire.

Flere-Imsaho reveals that Gurgeh&#x27;s participation was part of a Culture plot to overthrow the corrupt and savage Empire from within, and that he, the player, was in fact a pawn in a much larger game. He is further told that in the aftermath of the final game, the Empire of Azad collapsed without further intervention from the Culture. Although Gurgeh never discovers the whole truth, in the final sentences of the novel the narrator is revealed to be Flere-Imsaho, who had been disguised as Mawhrin-Skel to manipulate Gurgeh into taking part in the game.

==Azad==
Azad is a game played in the Empire of Azad. In the language of the fictional Empire, the word &quot;Azad&quot; means &quot;machine&quot; or &quot;system&quot;, but is applied to any complex entity such as animals, plants or artificial machines.

The game is described in detail; however, the actual rules are never given to the reader. It is primarily tactical and played on three-dimensional boards of various shapes and sizes, though earlier rounds may be played exclusively in cards. Typically the boards are large enough for players to walk around inside them to move or interact with their pieces. The number of players differs from game to game and also influences the tactics, as players can choose to cooperate or compete with one another. As well as skill and tactics, random events may influence gameplay (often as card or other games of chance), and sometimes may change the outcome critically.

===Game elements===
The game consists of a number of minor games, such as card games and elemental die matching, which allow the players to build up their forces for use on the game&#x27;s three giant boards (in order: the Board of Origin, the Board of Form, and finally the Board of Becoming) and a number of minor boards.

The game uses a variety of pieces to represent a player&#x27;s units (military, resource or even philosophical premises). Some of the pieces are genetically engineered constructs, which may change form during the game according to their use and environment. These respond to their handling by a player and appear difficult to understand—during his training, Gurgeh is encouraged to sleep while holding some of the more important pieces so he can better understand them in play.

===Significance===
In the empire, the game is the main determinant of one&#x27;s social status. The game is played in a tournament every &quot;Great Year&quot; (roughly every six Culture years), initially consisting of some 12,000 players in the main series. Through the various rounds, these are all whittled down until the final game, the victor of which becomes emperor. Players knocked out from the main series may take part in further games to determine their careers. The complexity of the game aims to represent reality to such a degree that a player&#x27;s own political and philosophical outlook can be expressed in play (the idea being that rival ideologies are essentially &quot;tested&quot; in the game before the winners can apply them in reality). As the protagonist discovers, the game embodies the incumbent preferences of the social elite, reinforcing and reiterating the pre-existing gender and caste inclinations of the empire, putting the lie to the &quot;fairness&quot; which is generally perceived to govern the outcome of the tournament and thus the shape of Azadian society. In the novel, the protagonist ultimately finds that his (successful) tactics reflect the values of his own civilization, the Culture, though he also recognises that his own thought and behaviour have been markedly influenced by the manner in which he has been forced to compete. In a private audience with the emperor on the penultimate eve of the tournament, when confronted with the seeming absurdity of the possibility that a novice with a mere two years of experience at the game could systematically defeat players whose whole lives were devoted to its mastery, the protagonist comes to understand that his proficiency is merely a reflection of his experience with strategic games of all sorts. Given that, the Culture had intended all along to use him to discredit the brutality of the Azadian system by publicly giving the lie to the game&#x27;s representation of social reality.

==Legacy==
DSV &quot;Limiting Factor&quot; is named after the sapient warship (provided to Jernau Morat Gurgeh for transport) in the book. &quot;The naming of these vessels is a large tip of the hat and no small amount of admiration for Iain M Banks’ brilliant science fiction series,&quot; according to Victor Vescovo, who commissioned the deep-submergence vehicle.

In 2015, two SpaceX autonomous spaceport drone ships—&quot;Just Read the Instructions&quot; and &quot;Of Course I Still Love You&quot;—were named after ships in the book, as a posthumous tribute to Banks by Elon Musk.

Canadian singer Grimes released a song titled &quot;Player of Games&quot;, likely a reference to both the book and her relationship with Elon Musk.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described it as &quot;Predictable, certainly, and less imaginative than &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, but technically much more solid: honorably crafted work, often engrossing despite some sluggish patches.&quot;

<text>Luxembourg (; ; ; ; ; ), also called Belgian Luxembourg or West Luxembourg, is the southernmost province of Wallonia within Belgium. It borders the country of Luxembourg to the east, the French departments of Ardennes, Meuse and Meurthe-et-Moselle to the south and southwest, and the Walloon provinces of Namur and Liège to the north. Its capital and largest city is Arlon, in the south-east of the province, near the border of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

It has an area of , making it the largest Belgian province. With around 295,000 residents as of January 2024, Luxembourg is also the least populated province, with a density of , making it a relatively sparsely settled part of a very densely populated region, as well as the lowest density in Belgium. It is significantly larger (71%) than, but has less than half the population of, the neighbouring Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. About eighty percent of the province is part of the densely wooded Ardennes region. The southernmost region of the province is called Gaume or Belgian Lorraine (main city: Virton).
The Arelerland, the region around Arlon (coloured red on the map of arrondissements, below) bordering the neighbouring Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg has the particularity that many of its residents have historically spoken Luxembourgish alongside of Walloon spoken elsewhere in the province.

The province was separated from the grand-duchy by the Third Partition of Luxembourg, in 1830–31 by the Conference of London dealing with the consequences of the Belgian Revolution of 1830. In 1839, after William I, King of the Netherlands and Grand Duke of Luxembourg, agreed to the terms of the partition and the province was given to the newly created Kingdom of Belgium.

An unofficial flag of the province exists, with the current colours of Luxembourg (red, white, and blue), as well as the province&#x27;s coat of arms on the foreground.

<text>Zaanaim, Zaanannim or Bezaanaim is a place name applied to one or two locations in the Hebrew Bible. According to Serge Frolov (2013), its location &quot;cannot be determined with any degree of certainty.&quot;

The area was likely given the name Zaanaim because nomads camped there in tents among the towns and cities, with the name meaning &quot;wanderings&quot; or &quot;the unloading of tents.&quot;

According to Joshua 19:33, the border of the tribe of Naftali passed by the &quot;oak in Zaanannim&quot; (&quot;Revised Version&quot;).

According to Judges 4:11, Heber the Kenite&#x27;s tent, in which Jael killed Sisera, was &quot;as far as the oak in Zaanannim&quot; (&quot;Revised Version&quot;). Where the Revised Version reads &quot;oak,&quot; the King James Version reads &quot;plain.&quot; According to Cheyne and Black, an acceptable alternative reading for &quot;oak&quot; in these passages is &quot;terebinth&quot;.

Where the &quot;Revised Version&quot; has &quot;in Zaanannim&quot; above, the Hebrew text reads &quot;bṣʿnnym.&quot; It has been, however, suggested by some that, following the Septuagint and the Talmud, the letter &quot;b&quot;, which in Hebrew means &quot;in,&quot; should be taken as a part of the word following, and the phrase would then be &quot;unto the oak of Bitzanaim,&quot; a place which has been identified with the ruins of Bessum, about half-way between Tiberias and Mount Tabor.

<doc id="68863" wikidata="Q74362" url="?curid=68863" title="Excession">
<text>Excession is a 1996 science fiction novel by Scottish writer Iain M. Banks. It is the fifth in the Culture series, a series of ten science fiction novels which feature a utopian interstellar society called the Culture. It concerns the response of the Culture and other interstellar societies to an unprecedented alien artifact, the Excession of the title.

The book is largely about the response of the Culture&#x27;s Minds (benevolent AIs with enormous intellectual and physical capabilities and distinctive personalities) to the Excession itself and the way in which another society, the Affront, whose systematic brutality horrifies the Culture, tries to use the Excession to increase its power. As in Banks&#x27; other Culture novels the main themes are the moral dilemmas that confront a hyperpower and how biological characters find ways to give their lives meaning in a post-scarcity society that is presided over by benign super-intelligent machines. The book features a large collection of Culture ship names, some of which give subtle clues about the roles these ships&#x27; Minds play in the story. In terms of style, the book is also notable for the way in which many important conversations between Minds resemble email messages complete with headers.

== Plot summary ==
The Excession of the title is a perfect black-body sphere that appears mysteriously on the edge of Culture space, appearing to be older than the Universe itself and that resists the attempts of the Culture and technologically equivalent societies (notably the Zetetic Elench) to probe it. The Interesting Times Gang (ITG), an informal group of Minds loosely connected with Special Circumstances, try to manage the Culture&#x27;s response to the Excession. The Affront, a rapidly expanding race which practises systematic sadism towards subject species and its own females and junior males, also try to exploit the Excession by infiltrating a store of mothballed Culture warships and using them to claim control of the mysterious object.

The &quot;Sleeper Service&quot;, an Eccentric General Systems Vehicle (GSV) who had nominally left the Culture, is instructed to head to the location of the Excession by the ITG. As a condition the &quot;Sleeper Service&quot; demands that Genar-Hofoen, a human member of Contact, attend it to seek a resolution with his ex-lover, Dajeil, who lives in solitude on the GSV. They had had an intense love-affair and, after a series of sex changes, had each become impregnated by the other until Genar-Hofoen was unfaithful and Dajeil attacked Genar-Hofoen, killing the unborn child. Dajeil then suspended her pregnancy and withdrew from society for 40 years and the &quot;Sleeper Service&quot; hopes to effect a reconciliation between them.

As the stolen Affront fleet approaches the Excession, the &quot;Sleeper Service&quot; deploys a fleet of 80,000 remote controlled warships, in a misguided attempt to neutralize the threat. It transpires that the Affront have been manipulated into their grab for power by members of the ITG who thought it was morally imperative to curb the Affront&#x27;s cruelty by any means, and intend to use the Affront&#x27;s theft of Culture warships as an excuse for war. The Excession releases a wave of destructive energy towards the &quot;Sleeper Service&quot;. In desperation, the &quot;Sleeper Service&quot; transmits a complete copy of its personality, its &quot;Mindstate&quot;, into the Excession, which has the effect of halting the attack. The Excession then vanishes as mysteriously as it appeared and the brief war with the Affront is halted.

During these events, and after speaking with Genar-Hofoen, Dajeil decides to complete her pregnancy and remain on the &quot;Sleeper Service&quot;, which sets course for a satellite galaxy. Genar-Hofoen returns to the Affront, having been rewarded by being physically transformed into a member of the Affront species (whose company he finds more stimulating than that of the Culture&#x27;s people).

The book&#x27;s epilogue reveals that the Excession is a sentient entity that was acting as a bridge for a procession of beings that travel between universes. It also assesses whether the species and societies it encounters are suitable to be enlightened about some unknown further existence beyond the universe; as a result of events in the story the Excession concludes that the civilisations it has encountered in this universe are not yet ready. It also takes the name given to it by the Culture – &quot;The Excession&quot; – as its own – in an oblique reference to the aforementioned Affront species, who had been named by another species in an attempt to label them as a lost cause of hyper-sadistic freaks.

==Outside Context Problem==
This novel is about how the Culture deals with an Outside Context Problem (OCP). This is a problem that is &quot;outside the context&quot; as it is generally not considered until it occurs, and the capacity to actually conceive of or consider the OCP in the first place may not be possible or very limited (i.e., the majority of the group&#x27;s population may not have the knowledge or ability to realize that the OCP can arise, or assume it is extremely unlikely). An example of OCP is an event in which a civilization does not consider the possibility that a much more technologically advanced society can exist, and then encounters one. 

The term is coined by Banks for the purpose of this novel, and described as follows:

Banks has noted that he spent much time playing the &quot;Civilization&quot; computer game (appearing to refer to the first version of the game series) before writing the book and that it was one of the inspirations for the concept of the &#x27;Outside Context Problem&#x27; central to the novel. In an interview, Banks specifically compares this to having a &quot;Civilization&quot; battleship arrive while the player is still using wooden sailing ships.

==Literary significance and criticism==

===Banks&#x27; view of the Culture===
The book, more than any of the other Culture novels, focuses on the Culture&#x27;s Minds as protagonists.

When asked about his focus on the possibilities of technology in fiction, Banks said about the book:

The book shows a number of Minds acting in a decidedly non-benevolent way, somewhat qualifying the godlike incorruptibility and benevolence they are ascribed in other Culture novels. Banks himself has described the actions of some of the Minds in the novel as akin to &quot;barbarian kings presented with the promise of gold in the hills.&quot;

===Reviews===
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described the book as &quot;Brilliantly inventive and amusing – whole sections read like strings of knowing jokes – but a mess: Chattering spaceships with splendid if confusing names [...] don&#x27;t compensate for the absence of real characters.&quot; A few who praised it commented that &quot;Excession&quot;″s complexity and frequent use of in-jokes make it advisable for new readers of Banks&#x27; Culture stories to start with other books. In a retrospective of &quot;Excession&quot; at Tor, Peter Tieryas writes, &quot;There are literally paragraphs thrown in as background detail that could make for amazing novels of their own. Part of the joy of &quot;Excession&quot; is hearing the Minds speak with each other, that matrix-like shower of numbers, text, esoteric syntax, and witty repartee.&quot;

Reviewed in &quot;Arcane Magazine&quot; with a 10/10 rating, the novel was an &quot;astounding achievement,&quot; regarded as &quot;huge in scope, intricate in detail, swaying from pathos to metaphysics and from humour to light-speed action,&quot; with Banks considered, &quot;a science-fiction writer truly without equal at the moment.&quot;

<text>Peter I (c. 1048 – 9 August 1078) was count of Savoy and margrave of Turin jointly with his brother Amadeus II of Savoy from c. 1060 to 1078. He ruled only nominally, as true power was in the hands of his mother, Adelaide of Susa.

Peter presided over court hearings alongside Adelaide and also issued several donation charters with her and his brothers Amadeus II of Savoy and Otto. Shortly before his death, Peter united with Bishop Cunibert of Turin in an attempt to drive Abbot Benedict II from his abbey of San Michele della Chiusa.

Peter married Agnes of Aquitaine, c.1065. They had two daughters:
*Agnes (d.after 1110), who married Frederick of Montbéliard in 1080. After marrying Agnes, Frederick became Margrave of Turin (r.1080-1091).
* Alice (d.ca 1111), who may have married Margrave Boniface of Vasto and Saluzzo in 1099

<doc id="68867" wikidata="Q5208897" url="?curid=68867" title="Dahlia 'Bishop of Llandaff'">
<text>&#x27;Bishop of Llandaff&#x27; is a cultivar of the dahlia, a garden plant. It is a branching, tuberous tender perennial with dark purple, almost black, foliage. This produces a stunning contrast with its scarlet flowers. The plant was first bred by Fred Treseder, a Cardiff nurseryman. It was selected by and named to honour Joshua Pritchard Hughes, Bishop of Llandaff, in 1924 and won the RHS Award of Garden Merit in 1928. The plant is about 1 m tall and flowers from June until September. As with all dahlias, frost blackens its foliage, and in areas prone to frost its tubers need to be overwintered in a dry, frost-free place. The variety became very popular in the 1990s.

The simpler form (single or semi-double) of the flower makes the nectar and pollen more accessible to pollinating insects.

A seed strain has been produced from this plant called &#x27;Bishops Children&#x27;, they retain the dark foliage colour but produce a mix of flower colours and flower shapes from single to semi-double flowers in different sizes.

Plant Profile:
*Height: 
*Spread: 
*Site: full sun
*Soil: fertile, free-draining
*Hardiness: half-hardy

Also comes in rich reds and purples, yellows and oranges, as well as paler shades

<doc id="68868" wikidata="Q2902201" url="?curid=68868" title="Big Dumb Object">
<text>In discussion of science fiction, a Big Dumb Object (BDO) is any mysterious object, usually of extraterrestrial or unknown origin and immense power, in a story which generates an intense sense of wonder by its mere existence. To a certain extent, the term deliberately deflates the intended grandeur of the mysterious object.

The coining of the term has been attributed to reviewer Roz Kaveney in 1981, but it was not in general use until Peter Nicholls included it in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; as a joke in 1993. 

Edward Guimont and Horace A. Smith propose that the origins of the Big Dumb Object trope can be found in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s novellas &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; and &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot;, both of which feature human expeditions to immense ancient alien cities in remote parts of our world, and both of which were early influences upon Arthur C. Clarke.

==List of examples==
Big Dumb Objects often exhibit extreme or unusual properties, or a total absence of some expected properties:

* The monolith in Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (foreshadowed in &quot;The Sentinel&quot;) is an indecipherable influence upon the protohumans who it first appears to. Later in the film, the monolith serves to show how little humans have evolved. The astronaut Bowman&#x27;s attempt to interact with the monolith only makes him a part of its mystery.

* In Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, a 50km-long cylinder is detected entering the solar system. A similar cylindrical probe of gargantuan dimensions threatens Earth in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;.
*The object discovered in &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was made of a material of extreme hardness, such that diamond-tipped drills and acetylene torches would not damage it. At the same time nothing would adhere to it.

* Charles Sheffield&#x27;s Heritage Universe setting features many immense alien artifacts, some of which are more inscrutable than others.

* The Marker from &quot;Dead Space&quot; emits a persistent electromagnetic field from seemingly no source, which could be used to provide limitless energy. Attempting to reverse engineer the Marker, scientists discover that the electromagnetic fields generated by the Marker cause living people to suffer paranoia and hallucinations, while also causing the dead to reanimate, becoming &quot;Necromorphs&quot;.

* In the movie based on Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;Sphere&quot;, the eponymous object would reflect everything in its presence except people. If it did reflect someone, they were alone, and the individual was accepted as worthy to harness the device&#x27;s power.

* In Iain Banks&#x27; novel &quot;Against a Dark Background&quot;, the Lazy Guns have a lot of mass and yet little weight, and weigh three times as much upside-down as upright.
** By the same author, the titular Excession is a blackbody sphere that appears on the edge of Culture space and just sits there being inscrutable (even to Culture technology).

* The dome from the Stephen King novel and television show &quot;Under the Dome&quot; is large and transparent unless touched by a person; it gives a slight electric shock when touched for the first time by someone, but not afterward. It cannot be penetrated, even by a MOAB bomb, and is seemingly causing many mysterious events in Chester&#x27;s Mill, the town that the dome is enclosing, including causing all electronic devices near it to explode, visions, and, in one character, premature birth. 

* In Dan Simmons&#x27; 1989 novel &quot;Hyperion&quot;, the mysterious Time Tombs, &quot;huge brooding structures&quot; which are moving backwards through time, and whose purpose, origin, and nature are not explained in the book, are the objective of the characters&#x27; pilgrimage.

Such unexpected properties are usually used to rule out conventional origins for the BDO and increase the sense of mystery, and even fear, for the characters interacting with it.

<text>A fruit press is a device used to separate fruit solids—stems, skins, seeds, pulp, leaves, and detritus—from fruit juice.

==History==

In the United States, Madeline Turner invented the Turner&#x27;s Fruit-Press, in 1916.

==Cider press==
A cider press is used to crush apples or pears. In North America, the unfiltered juice is referred to as cider, becoming known as apple juice once filtered; in Britain it is referred to as juice regardless of whether it is filtered or not (the term cider is reserved for the fermented (alcoholic) juice). Other products include cider vinegar, (hard) cider, apple wine, apple brandy, and apple jack.

The traditional cider press is a ram press. Apples are ground up and placed in a cylinder, and a piston exerts pressure. The cylinder and/or piston in a traditional cider press is designed to allow the juice to escape while retaining the solid matter. This is achieved through a controlled gap or a semi-permeable surface, where the pressure exerted by the piston forces the juice out of the crushed apples or pears, leaving the solids behind. The traditional cider press has not changed much since the early modern period. The only difference being that in earlier versions of the press horses were used to power the machine. Diderot&#x27;s Encyclopedie offers a portrayal of the traditional cider press,

&quot;This is how the cider mill is made. Imagine a circular trough made of wood connected to two wooden millstones like those used in a windmill, but fixed differently. In a windmill, they are horizontal, but in the cider mill they are placed in the trough vertically. They are fixed to a vertical piece of wood that turns on itself and which is placed in the centre of the circular part of the trough; a long axle passes through them; the axle is joined to the vertical axis; its other end juts out from the trough; a horse → is harnessed to it; the ← horse → pulls the axle by walking round the trough, which also moves the pressing stones in the trough where the apples are pounded. When they are judged to be sufficiently crushed, that is to say, enough for all the juice to be extracted from them, the apples are removed with a wooden spade and put into a large vat nearby. Enough apples are pounded to make a pulp or pomace.&quot;

Cider presses often have attachments to grind the apples prior to pressing. Such combination devices are commonly referred to as cider mills.

In communities with many small orchards, it is common for one or more persons to have a large cider mill for community use. These community mills allow orchard owners to avoid the capital, space, and maintenance requirements for having their own mill. These larger mills are typically powered by electrical or gasoline engines. Mill operators also deal with the solids, which attract wasps or hornets. Cider mills typically give patrons a choice between paying by the gallon/litre or splitting the cider with the mill operator.

Larger orchardists may prefer to have their own presses because it saves on fees, or because it reduces cartage. Orchardists of any size may believe their own sanitation practices to be superior to that of community mills, as some patrons of community mills may make cider from low quality fruit (windfall apples, or apples with worms). Those making speciality ciders, such as pear cider, may want to have their own press.

The world&#x27;s largest cider press is located in Berne, Indiana, US.

==Wine press==

A wine press is a device used to press grapes during wine making.

== Oil press ==

An oil press is a device used to extract oil from plants and fruits.

==DIY fruit press==
Given the simplicity of the design, and high usability, some people (e.g. those owning an orchard) have started building their own do-it-yourself (DIY) fruit press and have uploaded detailed instructions on how to do so.

<text>Look to Windward is a science fiction novel by Scottish writer Iain M. Banks, first published in 2000. It is Banks&#x27; sixth published novel to feature the Culture. The book&#x27;s dedication reads: &quot;For the Gulf War Veterans&quot;.
The novel takes its title from a line in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;:

&quot;Look to Windward&quot; is loosely a sequel to &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, Banks&#x27;s first published Culture novel. &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot; took its name from the following line in the poem and dealt with the events of the Idiran-Culture War; &quot;Look to Windward&quot; deals with the results of the war on those who lived through it.

==Plot summary==
The Chelgrians are a race of centaur-like cat aliens with three hind-limbs and a humanoid catlike torso. Major Quilan, a Chelgrian, has lost the will to live after the death of his wife, killed during the Chelgrian civil war that resulted from the Culture&#x27;s interference. A high-ranked Chelgrian priest offers Quilan the chance to avenge the Chelgrians who died by taking part in a suicide mission to strike back at the Culture. His &quot;Soulkeeper&quot; (a device normally used to store its owner&#x27;s personality upon their death) is equipped with both the mind of a long-dead Chelgrian admiral and a device given to the Chelgrians by a mysterious group of Involved aliens that can transport wormholes through which weapons can be delivered. Quilan is then sent to the Culture&#x27;s Masaq&#x27; Orbital, ostensibly to persuade the renowned composer Mahrai Ziller to return to his native planet Chel, but in reality on a mission to destroy the Orbital&#x27;s Hub Mind. To protect him from detection at Masaq&#x27;, Quilan&#x27;s memory is selectively blanked until he reaches his target, thus preventing the Mind from reading his thoughts.

Ziller lives in self-imposed exile on Masaq&#x27;, having renounced his privileged position in Chel&#x27;s caste system. He has been commissioned to compose music to mark a climactic event in the Idiran-Culture War. Upon hearing of Quilan&#x27;s visit, and suspicious of his reason for travel, Ziller scrupulously avoids him.

Quilan succeeds in placing the wormholes in the Orbital&#x27;s Hub, but the Mind was already aware of the plot because Quilan&#x27;s operator, the long dead admiral housed in his Soulkeeper, is actually a turncoat spy for the Culture. Although unable to track the locations on the other ends of the wormholes, the Mind suggests that the Involved &quot;aliens&quot; assisting Quilan&#x27;s mission may have been a group of bellicose Culture minds seeking to keep the Culture from being too complacent. Having struggled with painful memories of the Idiran-Culture war, when it was the General Systems Vehicle &quot;Lasting Damage&quot;, the Mind reveals to Quilan that it intends to destroy its own higher functions, essentially committing suicide, and offers to take Quilan with it. Quilan, who had become unsure of his own mission after experiencing dreams of his dead wife wearing the silvery skin of the Mind&#x27;s avatar, agrees. They both commit suicide simultaneously during the climax of Ziller&#x27;s concert, leading to much shock and outrage.

At the end of the novel, a nightmarishly efficient E-Dust Assassin is unleashed by the Culture in &#x27;retribution&#x27; against the Chelgrian priest who acted as a pawn for the bellicose Culture Minds, as well as his immediate co-conspirators. The assassin kills the priest gruesomely by transforming into a swarm of insects that eat him from the inside out. Throughout the book there is a subplot about a Culture ethologist named Uagen Zlepe spending his time on a distant alien air sphere and discovering hints about the Chelgrian plot to destroy the Masaq&#x27; Orbital&#x27;s Hub Mind. He attempts to warn the Culture, and the reader is led to believe that his intervention is the reason why the Mind knew about Quilan&#x27;s sabotage, but ultimately he fails to get his message out and is killed by one of the Chelgrian conspirators. His dead body is resurrected using alien technology an entire galactic grand cycle later, long after all the events of the story have ended. Back in the present, the Chelgrian admiral Huyler&#x27;s personality, kept alive from Quilan&#x27;s Soulkeeper, and the real source of the Mind&#x27;s foreknowledge regarding the attack, is given a new body and becomes an ambassador to the Culture, enjoying a very high standard of living. He says he is close to convincing Ziller to return to Chel, fulfilling Quilan&#x27;s cover mission.

The T.S. Eliot poem which the novel takes its name from is, in part:

The fate of Phlebas in the poem is similar to that of Uagen Zlepe in the novel. The title may also refer to the state of mind of the Masaq&#x27; Orbital Hub Mind and Major Quilan, both already having died in spirit during their respective wars.

==Reception==
Phil Daoust in &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the story was an &quot;enjoyable romp&quot; and described Quilan as &quot;one of the misguided yet decent villains who are a feature of these [Culture] tales&quot;. He went on to complain of the heavy emphasis given to the consequences of war and that the Chelgrians were too thinly disguised humans.

Gerald Jonas in &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the sophistication of Banks&#x27; writing and said &quot;he asks readers to hold in mind a great many pieces of a vast puzzle while waiting for a pattern to emerge&quot;. Jonas suggested the ending might appear to rely too much on a deus ex machina.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described it as &quot;By turns imposing, ingenious, whimsical, and wrenching, though too amorphous to fully satisfy.&quot;

<doc id="68871" wikidata="Q339923" url="?curid=68871" title="Use of Weapons">
<text>Use of Weapons is a science fiction novel by Scottish writer Iain M. Banks, first published in 1990. It is the third novel in the Culture series.

The narrative takes the form of a biography of a man called Cheradenine Zakalwe, who was born outside of the Culture but was recruited into it by Special Circumstances agent Diziet Sma to work as an operative intervening in less advanced civilizations. The novel recounts several of these interventions and Zakalwe&#x27;s attempts to come to terms with his own past.

==Plot summary==
The book is made up of two narrative streams, interwoven in alternating chapters. The numbers of the chapters indicate which stream they belong to: one stream is numbered forward in words (One, Two ...), while the other is numbered in reverse with Roman numerals (XIII, XII ...). The story told by the former moves forward chronologically (as the numbers suggest) and tells a self-contained story, while the latter is written in reverse chronology with each chapter successively earlier in Zakalwe&#x27;s life. Further complicating this structure is a prologue and epilogue set shortly after the events of the main narrative, and many flashbacks within the chapters.

The forward-moving narrative stream deals with the attempts of Diziet Sma and a drone named Skaffen-Amtiskaw (of Special Circumstances, a division of Contact Section) to re-enlist Zakalwe for another job. He must make contact with Beychae, an old colleague, who lives in a politically unstable star cluster, to further the aims of the Culture in the region. The payment that Zakalwe demands is the location of a woman, named Livueta. The backward-moving narrative stream describes earlier jobs that Zakalwe has performed for the Culture, ultimately returning to his pre-Culture childhood with his two sisters (Livueta and Darckense) and a boy his age named Elethiomel whose father has been imprisoned for treason.

As the two streams of the narrative conclude, it emerges that Elethiomel and Zakalwe commanded two opposing armies in a bloody civil war. Elethiomel took Darckense hostage before finally having her killed and her bones and skin made into a chair, to be sent to Zakalwe, who attempted suicide upon receiving it.

After the successful extraction of Beychae, a severely wounded Zakalwe is taken back to his homeworld to see Livueta. She rejects him and reveals that the person called &quot;Cheradenine Zakalwe&quot; is in fact Elethiomel, who had stolen the real Zakalwe&#x27;s identity after the latter had successfully killed himself during the civil war. Elethiomel suffers an aneurysm and Skaffen-Amtiskaw performs surgery in an attempt to save his life with initially unclear results. The epilogue is a continuation of the prologue; whether the story told by these &quot;bookends&quot; takes place prior to, or after, Zakalwe/Elethiomel suffers an aneurysm, is not immediately obvious until the epilogue, in which the clue that it takes place not long after is &quot;Zakalwe pushing his hand through long hair that isn&#x27;t there any more …&quot;

==History==
According to Banks, he wrote a much longer version of the book in 1974, long before any of his books (science fiction or otherwise) were published. The book had an even more complicated structure (&quot;It was impossible to comprehend without thinking in six dimensions&quot;) but already introduced the Culture as background for the story of Cheradenine Zakalwe. Realising that his intended structure was a &quot;fatal flaw&quot;, not least because it demanded the story&#x27;s climax appear exactly half-way through, Banks moved on to write&quot; Against a Dark Background&quot; instead. The book&#x27;s cryptic acknowledgement credits friend and fellow science fiction author Ken MacLeod with the suggestion &quot;to argue the old warrior out of retirement&quot; (to rewrite the old book) and further credits him with suggesting &quot;the fitness programme&quot; (the new structure). MacLeod makes use of similar structures in his own novels, most notably in &quot;The Stone Canal&quot;.

==Reception==
In 1990 &quot;Use of Weapons&quot; was nominated for a British Science Fiction Association Award. In 1991 it was nominated for an Arthur C. Clarke Award, and in 1993 it won the Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis for Foreign Novel. Tor.com reviewed the book favorably in 2017, describing it as &quot;beautiful and inevitable, and the tension is unbearable... There’s so much I love about this I hardly know where to start.&quot; The Pequod rated the book a 9.5 (out of 10.0), saying, &quot;This is first-rate science fiction, with unexpected depth as it explores the nature of morality, the effectiveness (and unintended consequences) of political intervention, and even the process of decision-making in the face of uncertainty.&quot; In 2012 it was selected for Damien Broderick&#x27;s book &quot;Science Fiction: The 101 Best Novels 1985-2010&quot;.

==Commentary==
&quot;Use of Weapons&quot; was voted the &quot;Best sci-fi film never made&quot; by the readers of The Register in 2011.

<text>The wilderness of Sin or desert of Sin ( &quot;Mīḏbar Sīn&quot;) is a geographic area mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as lying between Elim and Mount Sinai. &quot;Sin&quot; does not refer to the moral concept of &quot;sin&quot;, but comes from the Hebrew word &quot;Sîn&quot;, the Hebrew name for this region.

The location the Bible refers to is unknown, as its determination relies heavily on the location of Mount Sinai. The traditional Christian Orthodox identification of Mount Sinai as Jabal Musa (one of the peaks at the southern tip of the Sinai peninsula) would imply that the &quot;wilderness of Sin&quot; was probably the narrow plain of el-Markha, which stretches along the eastern shore of the Red Sea for several miles toward the promontory of Ras Mohammed; however, some scholars have since rejected these traditional identifications. Another identification among some modern scholars, of Sinai as al-Madhbah at Petra, would imply that the &quot;wilderness of Sin&quot; was roughly equatable with the central Arabah.

The &quot;wilderness of Sin&quot; is mentioned by the Bible as being one of the places through which the Israelites wandered during their Exodus journey; the similarly named &quot;wilderness of Zin&quot; is also mentioned by the Bible as having been a location through which the Israelites travelled. The biblical narrative states that on reaching the wilderness of Sin, the Israelites began to complain of the lack of food, as they had already consumed all the grain they had brought with them from Egypt. According to the account, Yahweh heard their murmurings, and so provided them with abundant &quot;manna&quot; and quail. 

Later they left the wilderness of Sin and complained about a lack of water while camping at Rephidim.

<text>The omer offering (&quot;korban omer&quot;), or the sheaf offering, was an offering (&quot;korban&quot;) made by the Jewish priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. The offering consisted of one omer of freshly harvested grain, and was waved in the Temple. It was offered on Passover, and signaled the beginning of the 49-day counting of the Omer (which concluded with the Shavuot holiday), as well as permission to consume &quot;chadash&quot; (grains from the &quot;new&quot; harvest). 

The omer offering was one example of a wave offering (Hebrew: &quot;tenufah&quot; ), which was waved in the Temple.

==Omer offering==
The offering containing an &quot;omer&quot;-measure of barley, described as &quot;reishit ketzirchem&quot; (&quot;the beginning of your harvest&quot;). Josephus describes the processing of the offering as follows:
After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an issaron for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest for the use of the priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest.

The leftover of the &quot;korban&quot; are kept by the &quot;kohen&quot; and was listed as one of the twenty-four priestly gifts.

The offering was made on &quot;the morrow after the day of rest&quot;. This phrase was variously interpreted (see Counting of the Omer): According to rabbinic tradition, the omer offering was offered on the second day of Passover, the 16th day of Nisan. According to Karaite Judaism, it was offered on the Sunday occurring within Passover.
The omer offering was discontinued following the destruction of the Second Temple.

==Counting of the Omer==

Along with the offering of the omer offering, the counting of the Omer begins. This is a count of 49 days beginning with the omer offering, and concluding with the holiday of Shavuot (which is the 50th day).

For rabbinic Jews, the count is performed at night. For example, the first day of the omer is counted on the second night of Passover (which precedes the second day, as Jewish days begin in the evening).

==Other wave offerings==
Various other offerings are also described as being waved as part of their ritual. After the ritual, the wave-offering then became the property of the priests.

The noun &quot;tenufah&quot; (waving) is formed from the verb &quot;nuf&quot; in the same way as &quot;terumah&quot;, the heave offering, is formed from &quot;rum&quot; &quot;heave.&quot; In the Septuagint, &quot;tenufah&quot; was translated &quot;aphorisma&quot; (ἀφόρισμα).

Both &quot;tenufah&quot; and &quot;terumah&quot; are often mentioned together. Both being given to the priests as kohanic gifts.

The Levites themselves were also offered to God by Aaron as a wave offering.

<doc id="68882" wikidata="Q451920" url="?curid=68882" title="Amadeus II, Count of Savoy">
<text>Amadeus II ( – 26 January 1080) was the count of Savoy from 1078 to 1080. His life is obscure and few documents mention him. During his rule, he was overshadowed by his mother, but he had good relations with the papacy and, for a time, the Holy Roman emperor.

==Before his countship==
The second son of Count Otto of Savoy and Margravine Adelaide of Turin, Amadeus II was probably born around 1050, because he, alongside other noblemen of the Kingdom of Burgundy, swore an oath on the tomb of Saint Peter in Rome to defend the Church around 1070–73. In 1074 Pope Gregory VII was trying to persuade William I, Count of Burgundy, to remember this vow and, with Amadeus and others, go to the defence of the Roman Empire in the East against the Seljuk Turks. As his mother is known to have had good relations with the Papacy in these years, this record seems to indicate that Amadeus was following his mother&#x27;s policies at this early stage in his career.

Early in 1077 Amadeus, with his mother and brother Peter, then Count of Savoy, hosted his sister Bertha, and his brother-in-law, Bertha&#x27;s husband, the Emperor Henry IV. Amadeus and Adelaide then escorted the imperial couple to Canossa so the excommunicated emperor could reconcile with the pope. There they both took part in the negotiations and stood as pledges for the emperor&#x27;s good faith.

On 16 July 1078, Amadeus and Peter witnessed a donation of their mother&#x27;s to the Abbey of Novalesa. It was the last act of Amadeus and Peter together.

==As count==
On 9 August 1078, Peter died and Amadeus succeeded him as Count of Savoy, but in the March of Turin, where Peter had co-ruled with their mother, Amadeus was never margrave, although the reason for this is unclear. One document, issued by his widowed daughter Adelaide in 1090, refers to him as &quot;count and margrave&quot; (&quot;comes et marchio&quot;), but it is probably anachronistic. There is only one document from his reign, in the cartulary of Saint-André-le-Bas in Vienne, which is dated when &quot;Count Amadeus [was] reigning.&quot; This shows, by the absence of the regnal year of the emperor, that despite his involvement in the reconciliation at Canossa, Amadeus II was neutral in the wider Investiture Controversy and the wars against Henry IV that it caused in Germany.

Amadeus died in Turin on 26 January 1080, according to the necrology of the church of Saint Andrew there. This date must be at least approximately correct, since Adelaide made a monastic donation for the benefit of the souls of her sons Margrave Peter and Count Amadeus on 8 March.

==Marriage, children and succession==
According to the much later &quot;Chronicles of Savoy&quot;, Amadeus married Joan, daughter of &quot;Girard, Count of Burgundy&quot;, who scholars have surmised to have been Count Gerold of Geneva. The &quot;Chronicon Altacumbae&quot; says only that &quot;the wife of Amadeus [was] from Burgundy&quot;, which might refer to Amadeus I. If his wife were Genevan, it would explain how the house of Savoy came to possess so early a large portion of the Genevois. His wife, whatever her name and origins, bore Amadeus II several children, although there is some uncertainty about how many. His confirmed children were:
*Adelaide, wife of Manasses II, sire de Coligny
*Ausilia (also Auxilia or Usilia), second wife of Humbert II de Beaujeu, whom she bore four sons by the last decade of the eleventh century: Guichard, Humbert, Guigues, and Hugh
*Humbert II, his successor as count of Savoy
*Constance of Savoy, wife of Otto II of Montferrat.

The succession of Amadeus II is unclear. His son Humbert II, who was later Count of Savoy, is well known, but in 1082 the Count of Savoy was Otto II. Although Amadeus is known to have had a younger brother named Otto, he is more likely to have been the Bishop of Asti of this name and time. This has led some scholars, beginning with the Conte di Vesme, to make Otto II the eldest son of Amadeus II, who succeeded him and was in turn succeeded by Humbert II. In the immediate aftermath of Amadeus&#x27;s death, Adelaide took control of all the Savoyard lands on both sides of the Alps.

<doc id="68883" wikidata="Q1972540" url="?curid=68883" title="Wensleydale cheese">
<text>Wensleydale is a style of cheese originally produced in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire, England, but now mostly made in large commercial creameries throughout the United Kingdom. The term &quot;Yorkshire Wensleydale&quot; can only be used for cheese that is made in Wensleydale. The style of cheese originated from a monastery of French Cistercian monks who had settled in northern England, and continued to be produced by local farmers after the monastery was dissolved in 1540. Wensleydale cheese fell to low production in the early 1990s, but its popularity was revitalized by frequent references in the &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; series.

==Flavour and texture==
Wensleydale is a medium cheese that is supple and crumbly. It has a slight honey aroma.

===Common flavour combinations===
The flavour of Wensleydale is suited to combination with sweeter produce, such as sweet apples. Many restaurants and delicatessens serve a version of the cheese that contains cranberries.

In Yorkshire and North East England, the cheese is often eaten with fruit cake or Christmas cake.

==History==

Wensleydale cheese was first made by French Cistercian monks from the Roquefort region, who had settled in Wensleydale. They built a monastery at Fors, but some years later the monks moved to Jervaulx in Lower Wensleydale. They brought with them a recipe for making cheese from sheep&#x27;s milk. During the 14th century cows&#x27; milk began to be used instead, and the character of the cheese began to change. A little ewes&#x27; milk was still mixed in since it gave a more open texture, and allowed the development of the blue mould. At that time, Wensleydale was almost always blue with the white variety almost unknown. Nowadays, the opposite is true, with blue Wensleydale rarely seen. When the monastery was dissolved in 1540, the local farmers continued making the cheese until the Second World War, during which most milk in the country was used for the making of &quot;Government Cheddar&quot;. Even after rationing ceased in 1954, cheese making did not return to pre-war levels.

The first creamery to produce Wensleydale commercially was established in 1897 in the town of Hawes. Wensleydale Dairy Products, who bought the Wensleydale Creamery in 1992, sought to protect the name &quot;Yorkshire Wensleydale&quot; under an EU regulation; Protected Geographical Indication status was awarded in 2013.

==References in culture==
George Orwell rated Wensleydale second behind Stilton in his 1945 essay &quot;In Defence of English Cooking&quot;.

In the 1990s, sales of Wensleydale cheese from the Wensleydale Creamery had fallen so low that production in Wensleydale itself was at risk of being suspended. The cheese experienced a boost in its popularity after being featured in the &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; franchise. The main character of the series, Wallace, a cheese connoisseur, most notably mentions Wensleydale as a particularly favourite cheese in the 1995 short &quot;A Close Shave&quot;. Animator and creator Nick Park chose it solely because it had a good name that would be interesting to animate the lip sync to rather than due to its origins in northern England where the shorts were set. He was also unaware of the financial difficulties that the company was experiencing. The company contacted Aardman Animations about a licence for a special brand of Wensleydale cheese called, &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit Wensleydale&quot;, which sold well. When the 2005 full-length &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; film, &quot;The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;, was released, sales of Wensleydale cheeses increased by 23%.

Wensleydale is one of the cheeses mentioned in the Cheese shop sketch of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; that Mr. Mousebender attempts to purchase, without success. There is a glimmer of hope the shop may have this variety of cheese, only for the proprietor to reveal that his name is Arthur Wensleydale, and he thought he was being personally addressed.

<text>Vine of Sodom is the translation of found in the King James and some other translations of the Bible into English, most notably in the Tyndale Bible, which renders it: &quot;Their vines are the vines of Sodom.&quot; The Douay-Rheims renders the phrase as, &quot;Their vines are of the vineyard of Sodom,&quot; the
JPS Tanakh: &quot;The vine for them is from Sodom,&quot; and the Revised Standard Version, &quot;For their vine comes from the vine of Sodom.&quot; The full verse in the King James Version reads: &quot;For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter.&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;Kî miggep̄en Səḏōm gap̄nām, ū-miššaḏmōṯ ‘Ǎmōrāh; ‘ănāḇêmōw ‘innəḇê rōwōš, ’aškəlōṯ mərōrōṯ lāmōw.&quot;)

Among the many conjectures as to this tree, the most probable is that it is the osher (&quot;Calotropis procera&quot;) of the Arabs, which grows from Jordan to southern Egypt. The fruit of &quot;Calotropis procera&quot; is therefore called &quot;apples of Sodom&quot;, Sodom apple, and Dead Sea apple. Although beautiful to the eye, are bitter to the taste.

Another conjecture equates it with the colocynth (&quot;Citrullus colocynthis&quot;). Its fruit are called Vine of Sodom, which, although beautiful to the eye, are bitter to the taste.

<text>The Valley of Salt, valley of saltpits, valley of Saltpits, or vale of saltpits () is a place where it is said David smote the Arameans (2 Sam. 8:13). This valley (the Arabah) is between Judah and Edom on the south of the Dead Sea. Hence some interpreters suggest the phrase, &quot;and he smote Edom,&quot; instead of the &quot;Arameans&quot; in the above text. This confusion may be due to the Hebrew word Edom אדם being similar to the word Aram ארם. In Hebrew, the resh &quot;ר&quot; and the daleth &quot;ד&quot; are very similar and easily confused if not written carefully. It is conjectured that while David was leading his army against the Ammonites and Arameans, the Edomites invaded the south of Judah, and that David sent Joab or Abishai against them, who drove them back and finally subdued Edom. (Comp. title to Ps. 60 [Ps. 59 in the Septuagint].)

2 Samuel 8:13 - And David became famous after he returned from striking down eighteen thousand Arameans in the Valley of Salt. (New International Version)

Here also Amaziah &quot;slew of Edom ten thousand men&quot; (2 Kings 14:7; comp. 8: 20-22 and 2 Chr. 25:5-11).

<text>The Valley of Rephaim (, &quot;Emeq Rephaim&quot;) (; , R.V.) is a valley descending southwest from Jerusalem to Nahal Sorek below, it is an ancient route from the coastal plain to the Judean Hills, probably named after the legendary race of giants. Emek Refaim (), the German Colony in Jerusalem, takes its name from this valley.

==Biblical narrative==
When David became king over all Israel, the Philistines, judging that he would now become their uncompromising enemy, made a sudden attack upon Hebron, compelling David to retire from it. He sought refuge in &quot;the hold&quot; at Adullam (), and the Philistines took up their position in (or raided) the valley of Rephaim, on the west and south-west of Jerusalem. Thus all communication between Bethlehem and Jerusalem was intercepted. While David and his army were encamped here, there occurred the battle narrated in and . Having obtained divine direction, David led his army against the Philistines, and gained a complete victory over them. The scene of this victory was afterwards called Baal-perazim.

A second time, however, the Philistines rallied their forces in this valley ( and ). Again, warned by a divine saying about hearing a marching sound in the tops of the baka trees (הבכאים, KJV &quot;mulberry trees&quot;, most modern versions &quot;balsam&quot;), David led his army to Gibeon, and attacked the Philistines from the south, inflicting on them another severe defeat, and chasing them with great slaughter to Gezer. There David kept in check these enemies of Israel and in consequence his fame grew.
==Archaeology==
One of the ancient farming complexes excavated in the Valley of Rephaim is Er-Ras, an Iron age terraced farm. 
==Railway==
The Tel Aviv – Jerusalem railway, originally known as the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway, uses the entire length of the Valley of the Rephaim from Jerusalem to its junction with Nahal Sorek.

<doc id="68889" wikidata="Q794587" url="?curid=68889" title="Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement">
<text>Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement were used primarily by ancient Israelites and appear frequently within the Hebrew Bible as well as in later rabbinic writings, such as the Mishnah and Talmud. These units of measurement continue to be used in functions regulating Orthodox Jewish contemporary life, based on halacha. The specificity of some of the units used and which are encompassed under these systems of measurement (whether in linear distance, weight or volume of capacity) have given rise, in some instances, to disputes, owing to the discontinuation of their Hebrew names and their replacement by other names in modern usage.

Note: The listed measurements of this system range from the lowest to highest acceptable halakhic value, in terms of conversion to and from contemporary systems of measurement.

== Contemporary unit conversion ==

While documentation on each unit&#x27;s relation to another&#x27;s is plentiful, there is much debate, both within Judaism and in academia, about the exact relationship between measurements in the system and those in other measurement systems. Classical definitions, such as that an &quot;etzba&quot; was seven barleycorns laid side by side, or that a &quot;log&quot; was equal to six medium-sized eggs, are also open to debate.
Nevertheless, the entire system of measurement bears profound resemblance to the Babylonian and the ancient Egyptian systems, and is currently understood to have likely been derived from some combination of the two. Scholars commonly infer the absolute sizes based on the better-known Babylonian units&#x27; relations to their contemporary counterparts.

== Length and distance ==
The original measures of length were clearly derived from the human body—the finger, hand, arm, span, foot, and pace—but since these measures differ between individuals, they are reduced to a certain standard for general use. The Israelite system thus used divisions of the digit or fingerbreadth (Hebrew: אצבע, &quot;etzba&quot;; plural &quot;etzba&#x27;ot&quot;), the palm or handbreadth (Hebrew: טפח, &#x27;; plural &#x27;/&#x27;), which is equal to four fingerbreadths, the span (Hebrew: זרת, ), the ell or cubit (Hebrew: אמה, &quot;Amah&quot;, plural &quot;Amot&quot;), the mile (Hebrew: מיל, &quot;mil&quot;; plural &quot;milim&quot;), and the parsa&quot;&#x27; (Hebrew: פרסה, &quot;parasa&quot;). The latter two are loan words into the Hebrew language, and borrowed measurements - the Latin &quot;mille&quot;, and Iranian &quot;parasang&quot;, respectively; both were units of distance, and thus varied according to terrain and stride length, and, in the case of the &quot;parasang&quot;, also on the speed of travel.

The Israelite measurements were related as follows:
* 1 palm [handbreadth] () = 4 digit (&quot;etzba&#x27;ot&quot;)
* 1 span () = 3 palms ()
* 1 ell [cubit] () = 2 spans (), or 6 palms [handbreadths]
* 1 mil () = 2000 ells [cubits] ()
* 1 parasang () = 4 mils ()

=== Discrepancies of ell ===
The biblical &quot;ell&quot; is closely related to the cubit, but two different factors are given in the Bible; Ezekiel&#x27;s measurements imply that the ell was equal to 1 cubit plus 1 palm (&quot;Tefah&quot;), while elsewhere in the Bible, the ell is equated with 1 cubit exactly. Ezekiel&#x27;s ell, by which he gave measurements in his guided vision through a future Jerusalem Temple, is thus one sixth larger than the standard ell, for which an explanation seems to be suggested by the Book of Chronicles; the Chronicler writes that Solomon&#x27;s Temple was built according to &quot;cubits following the first measure&quot;, suggesting that over the course of time the original ell was supplanted by a smaller one. The Egyptians also used two different ells, one of which—the &quot;royal&quot; ell—was a sixth larger than the common ell; this &quot;royal&quot; measurement was the earlier of the two in Egyptian use, and the one which the Pyramids of the 3rd and 4th Dynasties seem to be measured in integer multiples of.

The smaller of the Egyptian ells measured , but the standard Babylonian ell, cast in stone on one of the statues of King Gudea, was 49.5 cm (19.49 in), and the larger Egyptian ell was between 52.5 and 52.8 cm (20.67 and 20.79 in). The Books of Samuel portray the Temple as having a Phoenician architect, and in Phoenicia it was the Babylonian ell which was used to measure the size of parts of ships. Thus scholars are uncertain whether the standard Biblical ell would have been 49.5 or 52.5 cm (19.49 or 20.67 in), but are fairly certain that it was one of these two figures. From these figures for the size of a Biblical ell, that of the basic unit—the finger-breadth (&quot;Etzba&quot;)—can be calculated to be either 2.1 or 2.2 cm (0.83 or 0.87 in); Rav Avraham Chaim Naeh approximates at 2 cm (0.79 in); Talmudic scholar Chazon Ish at 2.38 cm (0.94 in). The &quot;mile&quot; (&quot;Mil&quot;) is thus about 963 or 1146 meters (3160 or 3760 ft)—approximately six or seven tenths of a mile, and significantly shorter than the modern statute or land mile of 5280 ft or 1760 yd (approximately 1.6 km).

The precise width of the &quot;etzba&quot; (finger) has been a subject of controversy among halakhic authorities. The best known are those of the Rav Chayim No&#x27;eh and Chazon Ish.

See also Rabbi Chaim P. Benish&#x27;s &quot;Midos V&#x27;Shiurei Torah&quot; where he brings an alternative view in understanding the &quot;Rambam&quot; and therefore suggests that the , according to the &quot;Rambam&quot;, is 0.748–0.756 in (1.90–1.92 cm). This affects the other measurements in the following ways: 2.99–3.02 in (7.59–7.67 cm); 8.98–9.07 in (22.81–23.03 cm); 17.95–18.14 in (45.59–46.08 cm).

Alternatively, according to some early authorities a is two instead of three.

===Talmudic additions===
To the somewhat simple system of distance, the Talmud adds a few more units, namely the double palm (Hebrew: חסיט, ), the pace (Hebrew: פסיעה, ), the cord (Hebrew: חבל, ), the stadium (Hebrew: ריס, ), the day&#x27;s journey (Hebrew:דרך יום, ), and an undetermined quantity named the (Hebrew: גרמידא). The &quot;stadium&quot; appears to have been adopted from Persia, while the &quot;double palm&quot; seems to have been derived from the Greek .
The relationship between four of these &quot;additional&quot; units and the earlier system is as follows:
* 1 double palm () = 2 palms ()
* 1 pace () = 1 ell ()
* 1 stadium () = 1600 palms ( mile) (). Others say that 1 stadium was equivalent to 470–500 cubits.
* 1 day&#x27;s journey (&quot;derekh yom&quot;) = 10 parasangs (&quot;parasa&quot;)

The other two additional units are more ambiguous. The &quot;garmida&quot; is mentioned repeatedly but without its size being indicated; it is even sometimes treated as an area, and as a volume. The &quot;cord&quot; is given two different definitions; in the Mishnah it is 50 ells, but in the Gemara it is only 4 ells.

==Area==
The Israelite system of measuring area was fairly informal; the biblical text merely measures areas by describing how much land could be sown with a certain volume measure of seed, for example the amount of land able to be sown with 2 &quot;seah&quot;s of barley. The closest thing to a formal area unit was the yoke ( ) (sometimes translated as &quot;acre&quot;), which referred to the amount of land that a pair of yoked oxen could plough in a single day; in Mesopotamia the standard estimate for this was 6,480 square cubits, which is roughly equal to a third of an acre.

&quot;Searah&quot; () - (pl. ) hair, square of a 

&quot;Adashah&quot; () - (pl. ) lentils, of a 

&quot;Geris&quot; () - (pl. ) hulled fava bean, a circle with a diameter of about 2 centimeters (0.8 in)

&quot;Amah al amah&quot; () - (pl. ) square cubit 0.232 to 0.328 m2 (2.50-3.53 ft2)

&quot;Beit rova&quot; () - (pl. ) space of 10.5 cubits x 10.5 cubits for sowing &quot;kav&quot; of seed ( &quot;kav&quot; containing the volume of 6 eggs). Area varies between 24 and 34.5 m2 (258–372 ft2)

&quot;Beit seah&quot; () - (pl. ) space for sowing a 576 to 829.5 m2 (689-992 yd2)

&quot;Beit kor&quot; () - (pl. ) space for sowing a of seed, or what is 30 in volume; the area needed is appx. 1.73 to 2.48 hectares (4.27-6.15 acres), or about 23,000 m2 in area.

==Volume==
The Israelite system of powder/liquid volume measurements corresponds exactly with the Babylonian system. Unlike the Egyptian system, which has units for multiples of 1, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 of the base unit, the Babylonian system is founded on multiples of 6 and 10, namely units of 1, 12, 24, 60, 72 (60 plus 12), 120, and 720. The basic unit was the &quot;mina&quot;, which was defined as 1 sixtieth of a &quot;maris&quot;, which itself was the quantity of water equal in weight to a light royal talent; the &quot;maris&quot; was thus equal to about 30.3 litres, and hence the &quot;mina&quot; is equal to about 0.505 litres. In the Israelite system, the term &quot;log&quot; is used in place of the Babylonian &quot;mina&quot; but the measurement is otherwise the same.

Although they both use the &quot;log&quot; as the basic unit, the Israelites differentiated their systems of volume measure between dry and liquid states.

===Dry measure===
For dry measurement, or what is simply a measure of capacity rather than of weight, the smallest unit of which is the &quot;beitza&quot; (egg), followed by the &quot;log&quot; (לג), followed by the &quot;kab&quot; (קב), followed by the &quot;se&#x27;ah&quot; (סאה), followed by the &quot;ephah&quot; (איפה), followed by the &quot;lethek&quot; (לתך), and finally by the &quot;kor&quot; (כור). The &quot;lethek&quot; is mentioned only once in the Masoretic Text, and the Septuagint translates it by the Greek term &quot;nebeloinou&quot; (νέβελ οἴνου), meaning &quot;wine-skin&quot;. These measurements were related as follows:
* 1½ &quot;eggs&quot; = Quarter of a &quot;log&quot; (also used for a cup of wine)
* 6 &quot;eggs&quot; (&quot;beitza&quot;) = 1 &quot;log&quot;
* 4 &quot;log&quot; (24 eggs) = 1 &quot;kab&quot;
* 6 &quot;kab&quot; (144 eggs) = 1 &quot;se&#x27;ah&quot;
* 3 &quot;se&#x27;ah&quot; (432 eggs) = 1 &quot;ephah&quot;
* 5 &quot;ephah&quot; = 1 &quot;lethek&quot;
* 2 &quot;lethek&quot; = 1 &quot;kor&quot;

The &quot;kezayit&quot; is, by different sources, considered equal to a &quot;beitza&quot;, of a &quot;beitza&quot;, or not directly related to the other units of volume.

The &quot;omer&quot;, which the Torah mentions as being equal to one-tenth of an &quot;ephah&quot;, is equivalent to the capacity of 43.2 eggs, or what is also known as one-tenth of three &quot;seahs&quot;. In dry weight, the &quot;omer&quot; weighed between 1.560 kg to 1.770 kg, being the quantity of flour required to separate therefrom the dough offering. In the Torah, it is the Priestly Code which refers to the &quot;omer&quot;, rather than to the &quot;se&#x27;ah&quot; or &quot;kab&quot;; textual scholars view the Priestly Code as one of the later sources of the Torah, dating from a period when Egypt and Assyria had much more direct influence over Israel.

According to Ezekiel 45:11 both the &quot;eipha&quot; and the &quot;bath&quot; were one tenth an &quot;homer&quot; (חומר &quot;HOMeR&quot;, not be confused with the &quot;omer&quot;). Boadt notes the word &quot;homer&quot; comes from the Hebrew for an &quot;ass.&quot; &quot;It is one ass-load.&quot;

===Liquid measure===
For liquid measure, the main units were the &quot;Log&quot;, &quot;Hin&quot;, and &quot;Bath&quot;, related as follows:
* 1 &quot;Log&quot; () = 4 &quot;Revi&#x27;ith&quot; (, )
* 1 &quot;Hin&quot; () = 12 &quot;Logs&quot;
* 1 &quot;Bath&quot; () = 6 &quot;Hin&quot;

The &quot;Bath&quot;, equal to 72 &quot;Logs&quot;, is thus the liquid equivalent of the &quot;Ephah&quot;, also equal to 72 &quot;Logs&quot;. The liquid equivalent of the &quot;omer&quot;, which appears without a special name, only being described as the tenth part of a bath, is as much of an awkward fit as the &quot;omer&quot; itself, and is only mentioned by Ezekiel and the Priestly Code; scholars attribute the same explanation to it as with the &quot;Omer&quot;—that it arose as a result of decimalisation. The Omer is mentioned as a tenth of an ephah in Exodus 16:36, before the Priestly code.

According to Herbert G. May, chief editor of two classic Bible-related reference books, the bath may be archaeologically determined to have been about 22 liters (5.75 US gal) from a study of jar remains marked &#x27;bath&#x27; and &#x27;royal bath&#x27; from Tell Beit Mirsim.
Based on this, a Revi&#x27;ith would measure (approx.) 76 ml or 2.7 fluid oz.

===Talmudic additions===
In Talmudic times many more measures of capacity were used, mostly of foreign origin, especially from Persia and Greece, which had both held dominance over Judea by the time the Talmud came to be created. The definitions for many of these are disputed. Those that were certain (disputed) fractions of the &quot;Kab&quot; include, in increasing order of size, (עוכלא), (תומן), and (קפיזא). Those that were larger, in increasing order of size, included the &quot;modius&quot; (מודיא), &#x27; (), &#x27; (גרב). Of unidentified size were the (אדרב), the (כונא), and the (קמץ); the latter two of these were said to equate to a &quot;handful&quot;. Some dry measures were used for liquids as well, e.g. &quot;se&#x27;eh&quot;. The &quot;&quot; (קורטוב) was used for very small amounts (1/64 of a &quot;log&quot;).

==Mass and money==

The Babylonian system, which the Israelites followed, measured weight with units of the &quot;talent&quot;, &quot;mina&quot;, &quot;shekel&quot; (Hebrew: שקל), and &quot;giru&quot;, related to one another as follows:
* 1 &quot;shekel&quot; = 24 &quot;giru&quot;
* 1 &quot;mina&quot; = 60 &quot;shekels&quot; (later 100 zuz)
* 1 &quot;talent&quot; = 60 &quot;mina&quot;

In the Israelite system, the ratio of the &quot;giru&quot; to the &quot;shekel&quot; was altered, and the &quot;talent&quot;, &quot;mina&quot;, and &quot;giru&quot;, later went by the names &quot;kikkar&quot; (ככר), &quot;litra&quot;, and &quot;gerah&quot; (גרה), respectively; &quot;litra&quot; being the Greek form of the Latin &quot;libra&quot;, meaning &quot;pound&quot;.
The Israelite system was thus as follows:

* 1 &quot;shekel&quot; = 20 &quot;gerah&quot;
* 1 &quot;litra&quot; = 60 &quot;shekels&quot;
* 1 &quot;kikkar&quot; = 60 &quot;litra&quot;

There were, however, different versions of the &quot;talent&quot;/&quot;kikkar&quot; in use; a &quot;royal&quot; and a &quot;common&quot; version. In addition, each of these forms had a heavy and a light version, with the heavy version being exactly twice the weight of the lighter form; the light &quot;royal&quot; talent was often represented in the form of a duck, while the heavy &quot;royal&quot; talent often took the form of a lion. The &quot;mina&quot; for the heavy &quot;royal&quot; talent weighed 1.01 kilograms (2.23 lbs), while that for the heavy &quot;common&quot; talent weighed only 984 grams (2.17 lbs); accordingly, the heavy &quot;common&quot; shekel would be about 15.87 grams (0.56 oz). According to Josephus, it was the heavy &quot;common&quot; talent, and its &quot;mina&quot; and &quot;shekel&quot;, that was the normal measure of weight in Syria and Judea; Josephus also mentions an additional unit – the &quot;bekah&quot; – which was exactly half a shekel.

Gradually, the system was reformed, perhaps under the influence of Egypt, so that a &quot;mina&quot; was worth only 50 shekels rather than 60; to achieve this, the shekel remained the same weight, while the weight of the standard &quot;mina&quot; was reduced. Moses mandated that the standard coinage would be in single shekels of silver; thus each shekel coin would constitute about 15.86 grams (0.51 troy ounces) of pure silver. In Judea, the Biblical shekel was initially worth about 3⅓ denarii, but over time the measurement had enlarged so that it would be worth exactly four denarii.

*&quot;Pruta&quot; (pl. ) - a copper coin (Hebrew פרוטה prutah) - 22 mg (0.34 troy grains)
*&quot;Issar&quot; (pl. ) - a Roman copper coin (As) - 177 mg (2.732 troy grains)
*&quot;Pundion&quot; (pl. ) - a Roman copper coin (Dupondius) - 349 mg (5.4 troy grains)
*&quot;Ma&#x27;ah&quot; (pl. = &quot;money&quot;) - a silver coin, (Hebrew &quot;gerah&quot;) - 699 mg (10.8 troy grains)
:In Hebrew it is called a Gerah (as in twenty gerah is a Shekel, Exodus); (litt. grain; also gram derives from it).

*&quot;Dinar&quot; (pl. &quot;Dinarim&quot;) - a Roman silver coin (Denarius (pl. &quot;denarii&quot;, (Hebrew &quot;Zuz&quot;, pl. &quot;zuzim&quot;) - 4.26 grams (0.137 ozt)
:In Hebrew, a silver Dinar was called a &quot;Zuz&quot; to avoid confusion with the gold Dinar.

*&quot;Shekel&quot; (pl. &quot;shkalim&quot;) - a Jewish silver coin (Shekel, (Hebrew שקל) - 14 g
:Moses instituted it as the standard coinage. From 8.39 to 15.86 grams (0.27-0.51 troy ounces) of pure silver (Chazon Ish).
*&quot;Pim&quot; - a weight discovered by archaeologists in the form of the pim weight. About 7.6 grams, or shekel.
*&quot;Sela&quot; (pl. &quot;selo&#x27;im&quot;) - a silver coin (tetradrachm) - 17.1 grams (0.55 ozt) (a &quot;sela&quot; equals two shekel).
* Dinar (pl. or ) - a Roman gold coin (Aureus) (Hebrew &quot;Dinerei zahav&quot;) - 7.99 grams (0.257 ozt) of gold (106.25 grams or 3.416 ozt in silver)
* &quot;Minah&quot; (pl. ) - a silver coin - 424.87 grams (13.66 ozt) - equivalent with &quot;maneh&quot; which is 100 &quot;zuzim&quot;.
* &quot;Kikar&quot; (pl. &quot;kikarim&quot;) - as a gold weight, equivalent to a talent of gold - 3000 shekel

== Time ==

=== Year ===

The Hebrew calendar is a lunar calendar synchronised with the seasons by intercalation, i.e. a lunisolar calendar. There are thus 12 ordinary months plus an extra month that is added in (intercalated) every few years. Some months vary in length by a day, as well. The months originally had very descriptive names, such as &quot;Ziv&quot; (meaning &quot;light&quot;) and &quot;Ethanim&quot; (meaning &quot;strong&quot;, perhaps in the sense of &quot;strong rain&quot; - i.e. &quot;monsoon&quot;), with Canaanite origins, but after the Babylonian captivity, the names were changed to the ones used by the Babylonians. With the Babylonian naming, the intercalary month has no special name of its own, and is merely referred to as &quot;Adar I&quot;, the following month being &quot;Adar&quot;/&quot;Adar II&quot; (in the Babylonian calendar, it was &quot;Adar II&quot; that was considered to be the intercalary month).

=== Week ===
The Israelite month was clearly broken up into weeks, since the Genesis creation (and biblical references to Shabbat) describe a seven-day week. The seven-day cycle is not seen as a cycle in nature and is rather a custom biblically originating from .

The modern Hebrew calendar follows a seven-day weekly cycle, which runs concurrently but independently of the monthly and annual cycles. The origin of Hebrew seven day week and the Sabbath, as well as the true meaning of the name, is uncertain. The earliest Biblical passages which mention it (Exodus 20:10 and 24:21; Deut. 5:14; Amos 8:5) presuppose its previous existence, and analysis of all the references to it in the canon makes it plain that its observance was neither general nor altogether spontaneous in either pre-exilic or post-exilic Israel. It was probably originally connected in some manner with the cult of the moon, as indeed is suggested by the frequent mention of Sabbath and New-Moon festivals in the same sentence (Isa. 1:13; Amos 8:5; H Kings 6:23).

The names for the days of the week are simply the day number within the week. In Hebrew, these names may be abbreviated using the numerical value of the Hebrew letters, for example &quot;Day 1, or Yom Rishon&quot;.

=== Day ===
In addition to &quot;tomorrow&quot; () and &quot;yesterday&quot; (), the Israelite vocabulary also contained a distinct word for &quot;two days ago&quot; (). &quot;Maḥaratayim&quot; (&quot;the day after tomorrow&quot;, &quot;over-morrow&quot;), is a dual form of , literally &quot;two tomorrows&quot;. In the Bible, the day is divided up vaguely, with descriptions such as &quot;midnight&quot;, and &quot;half-night&quot;. Nevertheless, it is clear that the day was considered to start at dusk.

By Talmudic times, the Babylonian system of dividing up the day (from sunset to sunrise, and sunrise to sunset), into hours (Hebrew: שעה, &quot;sha&#x27;ah&quot;), parts (Hebrew: חלק, &quot;heleq&quot;, plural &quot;halaqim&quot;), and moments (Hebrew: רגע, &quot;rega&quot;, plural &quot;rega&#x27;im&quot;), had been adopted; the relationship of these units was:

* 1 part (&quot;heleq&quot;) = 76 moments (&quot;rega&#x27;im&quot;) (each moment, &quot;rega&quot;, is 0.04386 of a second; 22.8 &quot;rega&#x27;im&quot; is 1 second)
* 1 hour (&quot;sha&#x27;ah&quot;) = 1080 parts (&quot;halaqim&quot;) (each &quot;heleq&quot; is 3⅓ seconds)
* 1 day = 24 hours (&quot;sha&#x27;ah&quot;)

To complicate matters, Halakha, speaking of the relative hour, states that there are always 12 hours between the break of dawn and sunset, so these measurements are averages. For example, in the summer, a day time hour is much longer than a night time hour.

<text>Amadeus III of Savoy (1095 – April 1148) was Count of Savoy and Maurienne from 1103 until his death. He was also known as a crusader.

==Biography==
He was born in Carignano, Piedmont, the son of Humbert II of Savoy and Gisela of Burgundy, the daughter of William I of Burgundy. He succeeded as count of Savoy upon the death of his father. Amadeus had a tendency to exaggerate his titles, and also claimed to be Duke of Lombardy, Duke of Burgundy, Duke of Chablais, and vicar of the Holy Roman Empire, the latter of which had been given to his father by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor.

He helped restore the Abbey of St. Maurice of Agaune, in which the former kings of Burgundy had been crowned, and of which he himself was abbot until 1147. He also founded the Abbey of St. Sulpicius in Bugey, Tamié Abbey in the Bauges, and Hautecombe Abbey on the Lac du Bourget.

In 1128, Amadeus extended his realm, known as the &quot;Old Chablais&quot;, by adding to it the region extending from the Arve to the Dranse d&#x27;Abondance, which came to be called the &quot;New Chablais&quot; with its capital at Saint-Maurice. Despite his marriage to Mahaut, he still fought against his brother-in-law Guy, who was killed at the Battle of Montmélian. Following this, King Louis VI of France, married to Amadeus&#x27; sister Adélaide de Maurienne, attempted to confiscate Savoy. Amadeus was saved by the intercession of Peter the Hermit, and by his promise to participate in Louis&#x27; planned crusade.

==Crusade==
In 1147, he accompanied his nephew Louis VII of France and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine on the Second Crusade. He financed his expedition with help from a loan from the Abbey of St. Maurice. In his retinue were many barons from Savoy, including the lords of Faucigny, Seyssel, La Chambre, Miolans, Montbel, Thoire, Montmayeur, Vienne, Viry, La Palude, Blonay, Chevron-Villette, Chignin, and Châtillon. Amadeus travelled south through Italy to Brindisi, where he crossed over to Durazzo, and marched east along the Via Egnatia to meet Louis at Constantinople in late 1147. After crossing into Anatolia, Amadeus, who was leading the vanguard, became separated from Louis near Laodicea, and Louis&#x27; forces were almost entirely destroyed.

Marching on to Adalia, Louis, Amadeus, and other barons decided to continue to Antioch by ship. On the journey, Amadeus fell ill on Cyprus, and died at Nicosia in April 1148. He was buried in the Church of St. Croix in Nicosia. In Savoy, his son Humbert III succeeded him, under the regency of bishop Amadeus of Lausanne.

==Family and children==
With his first wife Adelaide, he had:
* Adelaide married Humbert III of Beaujeu

In 1123 he married Matilda of Albon, daughter of Guigues III of Albon, they had:

* Matilda (1125–1158), married king Afonso I of Portugal
* Agnes (1125–1172), married William I, Count of Geneva
* Humbert III (1135–1188)
* John 
* Peter 
* William 
* Margaret (died 1157), founded and joined the nunnery Bons in Bugey
* Isabella
* Juliana (died 1194), abbess of St. André-le-Haut

<doc id="68897" wikidata="Q6497446" url="?curid=68897" title="Veil">
<text>A veil is an article of clothing or hanging cloth that is intended to cover some part of the head or face, or an object of some significance. Veiling has a long history in European, Asian, and African societies. The practice has been prominent in different forms in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The practice of veiling is especially associated with women and sacred objects, though in some cultures, it is men, rather than women, who are expected to wear a veil. Besides its enduring religious significance, veiling continues to play a role in some modern secular contexts, such as wedding customs.

==History==
=== Antiquity ===
Elite women in ancient Mesopotamia and in the Macedonian and Persian empires wore the veil as a sign of respectability and high status. The earliest attested reference to veiling is found a Middle Assyrian law code dating from between 1400 and 1100 BC. Assyria had explicit sumptuary laws detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman&#x27;s class, rank, and occupation in society. Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so. The Middle Assyrian law code states:§ 40. A wife-of-a-man, or [widows], or [Assyrian] women who go out into the main thoroughfare [shall not have] their heads [bare]. […] A prostitute shall not veil herself, her head shall be bare. Whoever sees a veiled prostitute shall seize her, secure witnesses, and bring her to the palace entrance. They shall not take her jewelry; he who has seized her shall take her clothing; they shall strike her 50 blows with rods; they shall pour hot pitch over her head. And if a man should see a veiled prostitute and release her and not bring her to the palace entrance: they shall strike that man 50 blows with rods; the one who informs against him shall take his clothing; they shall pierce his ears, thread (them) on a cord, tie (it) at his back; he shall perform the king&#x27;s service for one full month. Slave-women shall not veil themselves, and he who should see a veiled slave-woman shall seize her and bring her to the palace entrance: they shall cut off her ears; he who seizes her shall take her clothing.Veiling was thus not only a marker of aristocratic rank, but also served to &quot;differentiate between &#x27;respectable&#x27; women and those who were publicly available&quot;. The veiling of matrons was also customary in ancient Greece. Between 550 and 323 B.C.E respectable women in classical Greek society were expected to seclude themselves and wear clothing that concealed them from the eyes of strange men.

The Mycenaean Greek term , &quot;a-pu-ko-wo-ko&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;headband makers&quot; or &quot;craftsmen of horse veil&quot;, and written in Linear B syllabic script, is also attested since ca. 1300 BC. In ancient Greek the word for veil was (&quot;kalyptra&quot;; Ionic Greek: , &quot;kalyptrē&quot;; from the verb , &quot;kalyptō&quot;, &quot;I cover&quot;).

Classical Greek and Hellenistic statues sometimes depict Greek women with both their head and face covered by a veil. Caroline Galt and Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones have both argued from such representations and literary references that it was commonplace for women (at least those of higher status) in ancient Greece to cover their hair and face in public. Roman women were expected to wear veils as a symbol of the husband&#x27;s authority over his wife; a married woman who omitted the veil was seen as withdrawing herself from marriage. In 166 BC, consul Sulpicius Gallus divorced his wife because she had left the house unveiled, thus allowing all to see, as he said, what only he should see. Unmarried girls normally did not veil their heads, but matrons did so to show their modesty and chastity, their &quot;pudicitia&quot;. Veils also protected women against the evil eye, it was thought.

A veil called &quot;flammeum&quot; was the most prominent feature of the costume worn by the bride at Roman weddings. The veil was a deep yellow color reminiscent of a candle flame. The &quot;flammeum&quot; also evoked the veil of the Flaminica Dialis, the Roman priestess who could not divorce her husband, the high priest of Jupiter, and thus was seen as a good omen for lifelong fidelity to one man. The Romans apparently thought of the bride as being &quot;clouded over with a veil&quot; and connected the verb &quot;nubere&quot; (to be married) with &quot;nubes&quot;, the word for cloud.

Intermixing of populations resulted in a convergence of the cultural practices of Greek, Persian, and Mesopotamian empires and the Semitic-speaking peoples of the Middle East. With the spread of Christianity, the ordinance of headcovering by women became normative throughout Christendom because it was enjoined in the Bible and by the Church Fathers. Veiling and seclusion of women appear to have established themselves among Jews and Christians, before spreading to urban Arabs of the upper classes and eventually among the urban masses. In the rural areas it was common to cover the hair, but not the face.

=== Later history ===

For many centuries, until around 1175, Anglo-Saxon and then Anglo-Norman women, with the exception of young unmarried girls, wore veils that entirely covered their hair, and often their necks up to their chins (see wimple). Only in the Tudor period (1485), when hoods became increasingly popular, did veils of this type become less common. This varied greatly from one country to another. In Italy, veils, including face veils, were worn in some regions until the 1970s. Women in southern Italy often covered their heads to show that they were modest, well-behaved and pious. They generally wore a &quot;cuffia&quot; (cap), then the &quot;fazzoletto&quot; (kerchief/head scarves) a long triangular or rectangular piece of cloth that could be tied in various ways, and sometimes covered the whole face except the eyes, sometimes &quot;bende (lit. swaddles, bandages)&quot; or a wimple underneath too.

For centuries, European women have worn sheer veils, but only under certain circumstances. Sometimes a veil of this type was draped over and pinned to the bonnet or hat of a woman in mourning, especially at the funeral and during the subsequent period of &quot;high mourning&quot;. They would also have been used, as an alternative to a mask, as a simple method of hiding the identity of a woman who was traveling to meet a lover, or doing anything she did not want other people to find out about. More pragmatically, veils were also sometimes worn to protect the complexion from sun and wind damage (when untanned skin was fashionable), or to keep dust out of a woman&#x27;s face, much as the keffiyeh (worn by men) is used today.

In Judaism, Christianity, and Islam the concept of covering the head is or was associated with propriety and modesty. Most traditional depictions of the Virgin Mary, the mother of Christ, show her veiled. During the Middle Ages most European married women covered their hair rather than their face, with a variety of styles of wimple, kerchiefs and headscarves. Veiling, covering the hair, was the normative practice of Christian women until at least the 19th century and still extant in certain regions, in accordance with Christian teaching delineated by Saint Paul in . While in the Western world this practice largely lapsed in the 1960s with the rise of the sexual revolution, traditional congregations, such as those of Conservative Anabaptist Christians, as well as certain Oriental Orthodox Christians and Eastern Orthodox Christians, continue observing the ordinance of headcovering. Other Christian women, including certain Catholic and Lutheran, as well as certain conservative Reformed Christian women (such as those belonging to the Heritage Reformed Congregations or Free Presbyterian Church of North America), continue to wear a headcovering at least during prayer and worship. Lace face-veils are often worn by female relatives at funerals in some Catholic countries. In Orthodox Judaism, married women cover their hair for reasons of modesty; many Orthodox Jewish women wear headscarves (tichel) for this purpose.

Christian Byzantine literature expressed rigid norms pertaining to veiling of women, which have been influenced by Persian traditions, although there is evidence to suggest that they differed significantly from actual practice. Since Islam identified with the monotheistic religions practiced in the Byzantine and Sasanian empires, in the aftermath of the early Muslim conquests veiling of women was adopted as an appropriate expression of Qur&#x27;anic ideals regarding modesty and piety. Veiling gradually spread to upper-class Arab women, and eventually, it became widespread among Muslim women in cities throughout the Middle East. Veiling of Arab Muslim women became especially pervasive under Ottoman rule as a mark of rank and exclusive lifestyle, and Istanbul of the 17th century witnessed differentiated dress styles that reflected geographical and occupational identities. Women in rural areas were much slower to adopt veiling because the garments interfered with their work in the fields. Since wearing a veil was impractical for working women, &quot;a veiled woman silently announced that her husband was rich enough to keep her idle.&quot; By the 19th century, upper-class urban Muslim and Christian women in Egypt wore a garment which included a head cover and a &quot;burqa&quot; (muslin cloth that covered the lower nose and the mouth). Up to the first half of the twentieth century, rural women in the Maghreb and Egypt put on a face veil when they visited urban areas, &quot;as a sign of civilization&quot;. The practice of veiling gradually declined in much of the Muslim world during the 20th century before making a comeback in recent decades. The choice, or the forced option for women to veil remains controversial, whether a personal choice as an outward sign of religious devotion, or a forced one because of extremist groups that require a veil, under severe penalty, even death. The motives and reasons for wearing a hijab are wide and various, but ultimately depend on each individual person&#x27;s situation and can not be said to come from any one distinct reason or motive. Although religion can be a common reason for choosing to veil, the practice also reflects political and personal conviction, so that it can serve as a medium through which personal choices can be revealed, in countries where veiling is indeed a choice, such as Turkey.

===Veils for men===

Among the Tuareg, Songhai, Hausa, and Fulani of West Africa, women do not traditionally wear the veil, while men do. Male veiling was also common among the Berber Sanhaja tribes. The North African male veil, which covers the mouth and sometimes part of the nose, is called &quot;litham&quot; in Arabic and &quot;tagelmust&quot; by the Tuareg. Tuareg boys start wearing the veil at the onset of puberty and veiling is regarded as a mark of manhood. It is considered improper for a man to appear unveiled in front of elders, especially those from his wife&#x27;s family.

Ancient African rock engravings depicting human faces with eyes but no mouth or nose suggest that the origins of litham are not only pre-Islamic but even pre-historic. Wearing of the litham is not viewed as a religious requirement, although it was apparently believed to provide magical protection against evil forces. In practice, the litham has served as protection from the dust and extremes of temperature characterizing the desert environment. Its use by the Almoravids gave it a political significance during their conquests.
In some parts of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, men wear a &quot;sehra&quot; on their wedding day. This is a male veil covering the whole face and neck. The sehra is made from either flowers or beads. The most common Sehra (headdress) is made from fresh marigolds. The groom wears this throughout the day concealing his face even during the wedding ceremony. In Northern India today, grooms can be seen arriving on a horse with the sehra wrapped around the head.

== Veiling and religion ==
===Biblical references===
Biblical references include:

* Hebrew: &quot;mitpachat&quot; (Ruth 3:15; marg., &quot;sheet&quot; or &quot;apron;&quot; R.V., &quot;mantle&quot;). In Isaiah 3:22, this word is plural, rendered &quot;wimples;&quot; R.V., &quot;shawls&quot;, i. e., wraps.
* &quot;Massekah&quot; (Isaiah 25:7; in Isaiah 28:20 rendered &quot;covering&quot;). The word denotes something spread out and covering or concealing something else (compare with 2 Corinthians 3:13–15).
* &quot;Masveh&quot; (Exodus 34:33, 35), the veil on the face of Moses. This verse should be read, &quot;And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face&quot;, as in the Revised Version. When Moses spoke to them, he was without the veil; only when he ceased speaking, he put on the veil (compare with 2 Corinthians 3:13).
* &quot;Parochet&quot; (Exodus 26:31–35), the veil of the tabernacle and the temple, which hung between the holy place and the most holy (2 Chronicles 3:14). In the temple, a partition wall separated these two places. In it were two folding doors, which are supposed to have been always open, the entrance being concealed by the veil which the high priest lifted when he entered into the sanctuary on the Day of Atonement. This veil was rent when Christ died on the cross (Matthew 27:51; Mark 15:38; Luke 23:45).
* &quot;Tza&#x27;iph&quot; (Genesis 24:65). Rebecca &quot;took a veil and covered herself&quot;. (See also Genesis 38:14,19) Hebrew women generally appeared in public with the face visible (Genesis 12:14; 24:16; 29:10; 1 Samuel 1:12).
* &quot;Radhidh&quot; (Song of Solomon 5:7, R.V. &quot;mantle;&quot; Isaiah 3:23). The word probably denotes some kind of cloak or wrapper.
* &quot;Masak&quot;, the veil which hung before the entrance to the holy place (Exodus 26:36–37).
Note: , which the King James Version renders as: &quot;And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: Behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: Thus, she was reproved&quot; has been interpreted in one source as implied advice to Sarah to conform to a supposed custom of married women, and wear a complete veil, covering the eyes as well as the rest of the face, but the phrase is generally taken to refer not to Sarah&#x27;s eyes, but to the eyes of others, and to be merely a metaphorical expression concerning vindication of Sarah (NASB, RSV), silencing criticism (GWT), allaying suspicions (NJB), righting a wrong (BBE, NLT), covering or recompensing the problem caused her (NIV, New Life Version, NIRV, TNIV, JB), a sign of her innocence (ESV, CEV, HCSB). The final phrase in the verse, which KJV takes to mean, &quot;she was reproved&quot;, is taken by almost all other versions to mean instead, &quot;she was vindicated&quot;, and the word &quot;הוא&quot;, which KJV interprets as &quot;he&quot; (Abraham), is interpreted as &quot;it&quot; (the money). Thus, the general view is that this passage has nothing to do with material veils.

===Judaism===

After the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, the synagogues that were established took the design of the Tabernacle as their plan. The Ark of the Law, which contains the scrolls of the Torah, is covered with an embroidered curtain or veil called a &quot;parokhet&quot;. (See also below regarding the traditional Jewish custom of veiling – and unveiling – the bride.)

Traditionally, in Christianity, women were enjoined to cover their heads, and men were instructed to remove their hat when praying or prophesying. Wearing a veil (also known as a headcovering) is seen as a sign of humility before God, as well as a reminder of the bridal relationship between Christ and the church. This practice is based on in the Christian Bible, where St. Paul writes:

The early Church Fathers, including Tertullian of Carthage, Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus of Rome, John Chrysostom and Augustine of Hippo attested in their writings that men should pray uncovered, and that women should wear a headcovering. John Chrysostom (407) delineated Saint Paul&#x27;s teaching on the wearing of headcoverings by Christian women, continually: 
Additionally, the Church Fathers taught that because the hair of a woman has sexual potency, it should only be for her husband to see and covered the rest of the time. 
In Western Europe and North America, from the arrival of Christianity to those lands to the mid-20th century, women in most mainstream Christian denominations wore head coverings (often in the form of a scarf, cap, veil or hat). These included many Anglican, Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Moravian, and Reformed (including Continental Reformed, Congregationalist and Presbyterian traditions) Churches. In these denominations, the practice now continues in certain congregations and by individuals who have sought to follow the precedent set in Scripture and church history.

Christian veiling throughout the day is still practiced by those who wear plain dress, such as traditional Anabaptists including Mennonites (Old Order Mennonites and Conservative Mennonites), Hutterites, Schwarzenau Brethren (Old Order Schwarzenau Brethren and Dunkard Brethren Church), River Brethren (Old Order River Brethren and Calvary Holiness Church), Apostolic Christians, Amish (Old Order Amish, New Order Amish, Para-Amish and Beachy Amish), and Charity Christians, as well as Conservative Quakers.

Many Holiness Christians who practice the doctrine of outward holiness, also practice headcovering (such as the Calvary Holiness Church). The Plymouth Brethren and conservative Reformed and Presbyterian churches, along with Traditionalist Catholics, practice headcovering when praying at home and while attending public liturgies. In many Oriental Orthodox Churches and certain Eastern Orthodox congregations, the custom of women&#x27;s covering their heads continues in church (and when praying privately at home).

==== Veiling of nuns and consecrated virgins ====
A veil forms part of the headdress of some orders of nuns or religious sisters in Catholicism, Lutheranism and Anglicanism; this is why a woman who becomes a nun is said &quot;to take the veil&quot;. In medieval times married women normally covered their hair outside the house, and a nun&#x27;s veil is based on secular medieval styles, often reflecting the fashion of widows in their attire. In many institutes, a white veil is used as the &quot;veil of probation&quot; during novitiate.

A black veil is the traditional sign of a professed nun. Some monasteries or communities bestow the black veil at the first profession of vows, but usually it is bestowed with the profession of solemn vows. When the vows have been professed the white veil of a novice will be swapped for the black veil of the professed, and she is usually crowned with a wreath of flowers.

A veil of consecration, longer and fuller, is used by some orders whose nuns receive the consecration of virgins who are already in solemn vows or who are being consecrated as a virgin in the same ceremony. References to &quot;consecrated nuns&quot; in medieval literature refers to solemnly professed nuns who received the consecration of virgins from their bishops, usually some years after their final profession of vows. The reintroduced rite of the consecration of virgins for women living in the world provides, as the Roman Ritual.

Since the reintroduction of the rite of consecration of virgins for women living in the world in 1970, the newly consecrated virgin receives a veil as a sign of her consecration, as in ancient times.
The nuptial symbolism of the rite was displayed particularly in the bestowal of the veil on the virgin by the bishop, as can be found in the writings of Ambrose of Milan and in the oldest liturgical sources.

After the promulgation of Pope Paul VI&#x27;s decree &quot;Perfectae caritatis&quot; on the adaption and renewal of religious life most monastic orders for nuns retained the veil. Regarding other institutes of religious sisters who work as teachers, nurses or in other active apostolates, some wear the veil, while some others have abolished the use of the veil.

The fullest versions of the nun&#x27;s veil cover the top of the head and flow down around and over the shoulders. In western Christianity, it does not wrap around the neck or face. In those orders that retain one, the starched white covering about the face, neck, and shoulders is known as a wimple and is a separate garment.

The Catholic Church has revived the ancient practice of women to be consecrated by their bishop as a consecrated virgin living in the world. These virgins are set aside as sacred persons who belong only to Christ and the service of the church. The veil is a bridal one, because the &quot;velatio virginum&quot; primarily signified the newly consecrated virgin as the Bride of Christ. In ancient times his veil was called the &quot;flammeum&quot; because it was supposed to remind the virgin of the indissoluble nuptial bond she was contracting with Christ. The wearing of the &quot;flammeum&quot; for the sacred virgin Bride of Christ arose from the bridal attire of the strictest pagan marriage which did not permit of divorce at the time. The flammeum was a visible reminder that divorce was not possible with Christ, their Divine spouse. 

In Eastern Orthodoxy and in the Eastern Rites of the Catholic Church, a veil called an &quot;epanokamelavkion&quot; is used by both nuns and monks, in both cases covering completely the &quot;kamilavkion&quot;, a cylindrical hat they both wear. In Slavic practice, when the veil is worn over the hat, the entire headdress is referred to as a &quot;klobuk&quot;. Nuns wear an additional veil under the &quot;klobuk&quot;, called an &quot;apostolnik&quot;, which is drawn together to cover the neck and shoulders as well as the head, leaving the face itself open.

Some female members of Lutheran and Anglican religious communities also wear a veil, differing according to the traditions of each community.

==== Veiling of objects ====



Among Christian churches which have a liturgical tradition, several different types of veils are used. These veils are often symbolically tied to the veils in the Tabernacle in the wilderness and in Solomon&#x27;s Temple. The purpose of these veils was not so much to obscure as to shield the most sacred things from the eyes of sinful men. In Solomon&#x27;s Temple the veil was placed between the &quot;Inner Sanctuary&quot; and the &quot;Holy of Holies&quot;. According to the New Testament, this veil was torn when Jesus Christ died on the cross.

; Tabernacle veil
: Used to cover the church tabernacle, particularly in the Roman Catholic tradition but in some others as well, when the Eucharist is actually stored in it. The veil is used to remind worshipers that the (usually metal) tabernacle cabinet echoes the tabernacle tent of the Hebrew Scriptures, and it signals that the tabernacle is actually in use. It may be of any liturgical color, but is most often white (always appropriate for the Eucharist), cloth of gold or silver (which may substitute for any liturgical color aside from violet), or the liturgical color of the day (red, green or violet). It may be simple, unadorned linen or silk, or it may be fringed or otherwise decorated. It is often designed to match the vestments of the celebrants.
; Ciborium veil
: The ciborium is a goblet-like metal vessel with a cover, used in the Roman Catholic Church and some others to hold the consecrated hosts of the Eucharist when, for instance, it is stored in the tabernacle or when communion is to be distributed. It may be veiled with a white cloth, usually silk. This veiling was formerly required but is now optional. In part, it signals that the ciborium actually contains the consecrated Eucharist at the moment.
; Chalice veil
: During Eucharistic celebrations, a veil is often used to cover the chalice and paten to keep dust and flying insects away from the bread and wine. Often made of rich material, the chalice veils have not only a practical purpose, but are also intended to show honor to vessels used for the sacrament.
: In the West, a single chalice veil is normally used. The veil will usually be the same material and color as the priest&#x27;s vestments, though it may also be white. It covers the chalice and paten when not actually in use on the altar.
: In the East, three veils are used: one for the chalice, one for the diskos (paten), and a third one (the Aër) is used to cover both. The veils for the chalice and diskos are usually square with four lappets hanging down the sides, so that when the veil is laid out flat it will be shaped like a cross. The Aër is rectangular and usually larger than the chalice veil used in the West. The Aër also figures prominently in other liturgical respects.
; Humeral veil
: The humeral veil is used in both Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches during the liturgy of Exposition and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, and on some other occasions when special respect is shown to the Eucharist. From the Latin for &quot;shoulders,&quot; it is an oblong piece of cloth worn as a sort of shawl, used to symbolize a more profound awareness of the respect due to the Eucharist by shielding the celebrant&#x27;s hands from actually contacting the vessel holding the Eucharist, either a monstrance or ciborium, or in some cases to shield the vessel itself from the eyes of participants. It is worn only by bishops, priests or deacons.
; Vimpa
: A vimpa is a veil or shawl worn over the shoulders of servers who carry the miter and crosier in Roman Catholic liturgical functions when they are not being used by the bishop.
; Chancel veil
: In the early liturgies, there was often a veil that separated the sanctuary from the rest of the church (again, based upon the biblical description of the Tabernacle). In the Byzantine liturgy this veil developed into the iconostasis, but a veil or curtain is still used behind the Royal Doors (the main doors leading into the sanctuary), and is opened and closed at specific times during the liturgy. In the West, it developed into the Rood Veil, and later the Rood Screen, and finally the chancel rail, the low sanctuary railing in those churches that still have this. In some of the Eastern Churches (for instance, the Syrian liturgy) the use of a veil across the entire sanctuary has been retained.
; Lenten veiling
: Some churches veil their crosses during Passiontide with a fine semi-transparent mesh. The color of the veil may be black, red, purple, or white, depending upon the liturgical day and practice of the church. In traditional churches, there will sometimes be curtains placed to either side of the altar.

The Veil of Our Lady is a liturgical feast celebrating the protection afforded by the intercessions of the Virgin Mary.

===Islam===

A variety of headdresses worn by Muslim women and girls in accordance with &quot;hijab&quot; (the principle of dressing modestly) are sometimes referred to as veils. The principal aim of the Muslim veil is to cover the &quot;Awrah&quot; (parts of the body that are considered private). Many of these garments cover the hair, ears, and throat, but do not cover the face.

Depending on geography and culture, the veil is referenced and worn in different ways. The &quot;khimar&quot; is a type of headscarf. The &quot;niqāb&quot; and &quot;burqa&quot; are two kinds of veils that cover most of the face except for a slit or hole for the eyes. In Algeria, a larger veil called the &quot;haïk&quot; includes a triangular panel to cover the lower part of the face. In the Arabian Peninsula and parts of North Africa (specifically Saudi Arabia), the abaya is worn constructed like a loose robe covering everything but the face itself. In another location, such as Iran, the chador is worn as the semicircles of fabric are draped over the head like a shawl and held in place under the neck by hand. The two terms for veiling that are directly mentioned in the Quran is the jilbab and the khimar. In these references, the veiling is meant to promote modesty by covering the genitals and breasts of women.

The Afghan burqa covers the entire body, obscuring the face completely, except for a grille or netting over the eyes to allow the wearer to see. The &quot;boshiya&quot; is a veil that may be worn over a headscarf; it covers the entire face and is made of a sheer fabric so the wearer is able to see through it. It has been suggested that the practice of wearing a veil – uncommon among the Arab tribes prior to the rise of Islam – originated in the Byzantine Empire, and then spread.

The Bedouin living in Southern Palestine and the Sinai peninsula also use face veils. The traditional veils in Palestine are short and decorated with coins. In northern Sinai, the veil sections are longer, and often contain embroidery, chains, pendants, beads, … The Bedouin-style mask is known as al-maghrun, al-baghrah, or al-niqab.

In the UAE, Qatar and Oman, a face mask known as the burghu is used, and in Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, the batulah is used.

In Central Asian sedentary Muslim areas (today Uzbekistan and Tajikistan) women wore veils which when worn the entire face was shrouded, called Paranja or faranji. The traditional veil in Central Asia worn before modern times was the faranji but it was banned by the Soviet Communists.

In Pakistan, upper and middle-class women in towns wear burqas over their normal clothes in public. The burqa is the most visible dress in Pakistan. It is typically a tent-like garment worn over the ordinary clothes and is made of white cotton. Many upper-class women wear a two-piece burqa which is usually black in colour but sometimes navy blue or dark red. It consists of a long cloak and a separate headpiece with a drop-down face veil. Some educated urban women no longer wear the burqa. The burqa is also not worn by rural peasant women who work in the fields. In rural areas only elite women wear burqas.

==== Restrictions ====
The wearing of head and especially face coverings by Muslim women has raised political issues in the West; including in Quebec, and across Europe. Countries and territories that have banned or partially banned the veil include, among others:

*France, where full-face veils (burqa and niqab) have been banned in public places since April 2011, with a 150-euro fine for breaching the ban. All religious veils have been banned in public schools.
*Belgium, also banned full face veils in public places, in July 2011.
*Spain has several towns and cities which have banned the full face veil, including Barcelona.
*Russia&#x27;s Stavropol region has announced a ban on hijabs in government schools, which was challenged but upheld by the Russian Supreme Court.

Places where headscarves continue to be a contentious political issue include:
*United Kingdom, where the Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne called for a national debate about headscarves and their role in public environments in Britain.
*Quebec, where there is much discussion as to whether the province should allow people wearing a veil over their face to vote without removing it. 
*Europe, with a large Muslim population, the European Court of Human Rights has allowed countries to ban full-face veils, as it does not breach the European Convention on Human Rights.

=== Indian religions ===

In Indian subcontinent, from 1st century B.C. societies advocated the use of the veil for married Hindu women which came to be known as Ghoonghat. Buddhists attempted to counter this growing practice around 3rd century CE. Rational opposition against veiling and seclusion from spirited ladies resulted in system not becoming popular for several centuries. Under the Medieval Islamic Mughal Empire, various aspects of veiling and seclusion of women was adopted, such as the concept of Purdah and Zenana, partly as an additional protection for women. Purdah became common in the 15th and 16th century, as both &quot;Vidyāpati&quot; and &quot;Chaitanya&quot; mention it.

Sikhism was highly critical of all forms of strict veiling, Guru Amar Das condemned it and rejected seclusion and veiling of women, which saw decline of veiling among some classes during late medieval period. This was stressed by Bhagat Kabir.

== Bridal veils ==

The veil is one of the oldest parts of a bridal ensemble, dating as far back as Greek and Roman times, to hide a bride &quot;from evil spirits who might want to thwart her happiness&quot; or to frighten the spirits away. The veil also served to hide the bride&#x27;s face from the groom prior to the wedding, as superstition says that it is bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the ceremony.

In the context of weddings in Western Christian culture, the veil has been used to symbolize modesty before God, obedience, and when the veil is white, chastity; the practice of the wedding veil is part of the larger practice of the woman&#x27;s headcovering in Christianity, rooted in . By the 17th and 18th century, bridal veils were occasionally worn, but were generally out of fashion in Britain and North America, with brides choosing from many other options instead. However, the bridal veil returned to popularity after Queen Victoria wore a veil in her wedding to Prince Albert in 1840. The bridal veil became a status symbol during the Victorian era, and the weight, length, and quality of the veil indicated the bride&#x27;s social status. Bridal veils worn over the face were not common until the second half of the 19th century.

The tradition of a veiled bride&#x27;s face continues today wherein, a virgin bride, especially in Christian or Jewish culture, enters the marriage ritual with a veiled face and head, and remains fully veiled, both head and face, until the ceremony concludes. After the full conclusion of the wedding ceremony, either the bride&#x27;s father lifts the veil, presenting the bride to the groom who then kisses her, or the new groom lifts her face veil in order to kiss her. Some see the lifting of the veil as symbolically consummating the marriage, representing another thin membrane (the hymen) that will be physically penetrated on the wedding night. In Orthodox Judaism, as well as among Christians in certain parts of the world such as Eastern Europe, women will then wear a headcovering in public after being married (as well as while worshipping). In Scandinavia, the bridal veil is usually worn under a traditional crown and does not cover the bride&#x27;s face; instead, the veil is attached to and hangs from the back.

A bridal veil is not normally worn during a civil marriage ceremony, nor when the bride is remarrying. In these cases, when it is worn, the veil is worn as a fashion accessory as part of the bridal attire, instead of for its symbolism.

=== Judaism ===

In Judaism, the tradition of the bride wearing a veil during the wedding ceremony dates back to biblical times. According to the Torah in , Isaac is brought Rebekah to marry by his father Abraham&#x27;s servant, and Rebekah took her veil and covered herself when Isaac was approaching.

In a traditional Jewish wedding, just before the ceremony, the &quot;badeken&quot; takes place, at which the groom places the veil over the bride&#x27;s face, and either he or the officiating rabbi gives her a blessing. The veil stays on her face until just before the end of the wedding ceremony – when they are legally married according to Jewish law – then the groom helps lift the veil off her face. The most often cited interpretation for the &quot;badeken&quot; is that, according to , when Jacob went to marry Rachel, his father-in-law Laban tricked him into marrying Leah, Rachel&#x27;s older and homelier sister.

Many say that the veiling ceremony takes place to make sure that the groom is marrying the right bride. Some say that as the groom places the veil over his bride, he makes an implicit promise to clothe and protect her. Finally, by covering her face, the groom recognizes that he is marrying the bride for her inner beauty; while looks will fade with time, his love will be everlasting. In some ultra-orthodox communities, it is a custom for the bride to wear an opaque veil as she is escorted to the groom. This is said to show her complete willingness to enter into the marriage and her absolute trust that she is marrying the right man.

In ancient Judaism, the lifting of the veil took place just prior to the consummation of the marriage in sexual union. The uncovering or unveiling that takes place in the wedding ceremony is a symbol of what will take place in the marriage bed. Just as the two become one through their words spoken in wedding vows, so these words are a sign of the physical oneness that they will consummate later on. The lifting of the veil is a symbol and anticipation of this.

=== Christianity ===
In Christian theology, St. Paul&#x27;s words concerning how marriage symbolizes the union of Christ and His Church underlie part of the tradition of veiling in the marriage ceremony. In historic Christian traditions, the veil is seen as &quot;a visible sign that the woman is under the authority of a man&quot; and that she is submitting herself to her husband&#x27;s Christ-like leadership and loving care. As such, the practice of the wedding veil is part of the wider ordinance of the woman&#x27;s headcovering in Christianity, rooted in .

The removing of the veil can be seen as a symbol of the temple veil that was torn when Christ died, giving believers direct access to God, and in the same way, the bride and the groom, once married, now have full access to one another.

==== Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====
In 2019 a letter by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints President Russell M. Nelson and his counselors, Dallin H. Oaks and Henry B. Eyring, declared that &quot;Veiling the faces of deceased, &#x27;endowed&#x27; [members who have been through a temple ceremony] women prior to burial is optional&quot;; previously it had been required. The letter went on to say that such veiling, &quot;may be done if the sister expressed such a desire while she was living. In cases where the wishes of the deceased sister on this matter are not known, her family should be consulted.&quot; That same year veiling of women during part of the temple endowment ceremony was also made optional where it had been required before.

== Mourning veils ==
Veils remained a part of Western mourning dress customs into the early 20th century. The tradition of widow&#x27;s veiling has its roots in the attire of a Christian nun, which symbolized modesty and chastity, and the mourning veil became a way to demonstrate sincerity and piety. The mourning veil was commonly seen as a means of shielding the mourner and hiding her grief, and, on the contrary, seen by some women as a means of publicly expressing their emotions. Widows in the Victorian era were expected to wear mourning veils for at least three months and up to two and a half years, depending on the custom.

Mourning veils have also been sometimes perceived as expressions of elegance or even sex appeal. In a 19th-century American etiquette book one finds: &quot;Black is becoming, and young widows, fair, plump, and smiling, with their roguish eyes sparkling under their black veils are very seducing&quot;.

== Interpretations ==

One view is that as a religious item, it is intended to honor a person, object or space. The actual sociocultural, psychological, and sociosexual functions of veils have not been studied extensively but most likely include the maintenance of social distance and the communication of social status and cultural identity.

A veil also has symbolic interpretations, as something partially concealing, disguising, or obscuring.

== Tradition of veil use in China ==
China has a long tradition of wearing veils. Veils were used to cover the face and had been used since the Han dynasty, where they were called &quot;facial clothes&quot; or &quot;facial hats&quot;; they were used to protect its wearer&#x27;s face from the wind and sand when they would ride horses or when they would travel on long trips. In the Tang dynasty, mili and weimao were used to cover the face when horse riding. In the Song dynasty, women would wear a veiled hat or veil when they left their houses, honggaitou on their wedding, a veil called &#x27;white jade silk&#x27; during their mourning period.

<text>Mol () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Antwerp. The municipality only comprises the town of Mol. In 2021, Mol had a total population of 37,021 inhabitants. The total area is 114.19 km2.
Mol is a popular holiday resort, with many lakes surrounded by woods. There are two main tourist lakes:

*Zilvermeer, which opened as a Provincial Park in 1959 and offers a white sand beach as well as facilities such as an outdoor playground and an underwater museum for divers.
*Zilverstrand: Originally, it had only an outdoor lake with a white sand beach. Later, a caravan park was built and mid-1990s an indoor swimming pool was created.

Furthermore, there is a Sun Parks holiday centre called &quot;Kempense Meren&quot; with an indoor swimming pool. The museum of Jakob Smits is located in the former vicarage of Mol-Sluis. This displays works of the artist Jakob Smits (1855–1928) and other painters of the Molse School, who were attracted to the area by its rustic views including several windmills (of which only one remains).

In the north-east corner of Mol, near the Dutch border, lies the Norbertine Postel Abbey. Mol is also home to the SCK•CEN Belgian Nuclear Research Centre, the Flemish institute for technological research (VITO) and a European School. The first industries in Mol were the &quot;Vieille Montagne&quot; company and the explosive factory &quot;N.V. La Forcite&quot;. In 1872 the &quot;Sablières et Carrières Réunies&quot; (SCR), now , was founded in order to extract the silica sand layers in Mol for industrial applications. The company became the global market leader in this sector with production sites all over the world.

The 15 chapels were built by Pater Helsen in 1815 with 14 co-workers of the region. It is a protected monument.

<text>According to the Tanakh, Uzzah or Uzza ( or ), meaning &quot;Strength&quot;, was an Israelite whose death is associated with touching the Ark of the Covenant. The account of Uzzah appears in two places in scripture: 2 Samuel 6:3-8 and 1 Chronicles 13:7-11.

Uzzah was the son of Abinadab, in whose house the men of Kirjath-Jearim placed the Ark when it was brought back from the land of the Philistines. With his brother Ahio, he drove the cart on which the Ark was placed when David sought to bring it up to Jerusalem. When the oxen stumbled, making the Ark tilt, Uzzah steadied the Ark with his hand, in direct violation of the divine law, and he was immediately killed by the Lord for his error. David, displeased because Yahweh had killed Uzzah, called the place where this occurred &quot;Perez-uzzah&quot;, which means &quot;to burst out against Uzzah&quot;.

David was afraid to bring the Ark any further, and placed it in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months. The Lord then blessed Obed-edom and David went and brought up the Ark of God into the city of David.

<doc id="68903" wikidata="Q664561" url="?curid=68903" title="Humbert III, Count of Savoy">
<text>Humbert III (1136 – 4 March 1189), surnamed the Blessed, was Count of Savoy from 1148 to 1189. His parents were Amadeus III of Savoy and Mahaut of Albon. He ceded rights and benefits to monasteries and played a decisive role in the organisation of Hautecombe Abbey. It is said that he would rather have been a monk than a sovereign. On the death of his third wife, he retired to Hautecombe, but then changed his mind and, by his fourth wife finally had a son, Thomas. He sided with the Guelph party of Pope Alexander III against the Ghibelline emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The result was an invasion of his states twice: in 1174 Susa was set on fire, and in 1187 Henry VI banished him from the Holy Roman Empire and wrested away most of his domains. He was left with only the valleys of Susa and Aosta. He died at Chambéry in 1189. He was the first prince buried at Hautecombe. His memorial day is 4 March.

==Early life==
Humbert III was born around 1136 in the castle of Avigliana, Piedmont, near Turin, to Count Amadeus III of Savoy and Mahaut (Mathilde), Countess of Albon and Vienne. Humbert III is an important figure in medieval society, as attested in the history of the House of Savoy. His life was characterised by certain key features, including mysticism, borne of a vocation and tradition of the contemplative life. This he fostered in parallel with, and notwithstanding, his role as military leader and politician, undertaken reluctantly and only to safeguard his family’s dynastic claims.

With his father he had inherited from his grandfather, Humbert II, the dream of reuniting the fragmented Kingdom of Burgundy, in sharp contrast with a centralising policy of the French royal family. In those efforts, Humbert was supported by Frederick I Barbarossa, but found himself required to quell neighbouring feudal lords settled among his domains. Like his father, himself dying young when his son was not yet of age, his education was entrusted to Amadeus of Lausanne, former abbot of Hautecombe. Under his guidance the young Humbert made great progress in studies and spiritual formation, foregoing worldly glamour and giving himself to prayer, meditation and penance. To better achieve this he frequently withdrew to Hautecombe Abbey, on the banks of Lake Bourget in Savoy, founded by his father. It was always with expressions of regret when duties to the family and the Savoyard nobility called him back to political affairs.

==Marriages==
Amadeus III was a pilgrim in the Holy Land in 1122. He went there through the offices of Pope Callixtus II, and in 1146 he participated in the Second Crusade, and died on the island of Cyprus in Nicosia on 1 April 1148, where he was buried, leaving the twelve-year-old Humbert as heir. Although still at an early age, in 1151 Humbert was betrothed to Faidiva, daughter of Alphonse Jourdain, Count of Toulouse. She soon died without issue. He later married Gertrude, daughter of Thierry, Count of Flanders and Sibylla of Anjou. This second marriage was annulled.

In 1164, Humbert married Clementia of Zähringen, by whom he had two daughters: Alice and Sofia. She died in 1173, and he decided to retire to Hautecombe, but not for long. In 1177, the nobility convinced him to marry for the fourth time. As a wife, he took Beatrice, daughter Géraud I of Mâcon and Maurette de Salins. They had a son, Thomas, to continue the dynasty. Beatrice also bore him a daughter who died at the age of seven.

==Reign==
Humbert&#x27;s reign lasted forty years, and was characterized by struggles with the Holy Roman emperor, various lords and count-bishops. The main reason for conflict consisted in the patronage of the bishop of Turin by Frederick Barbarossa, who dreamed of undisturbed dominance of the capital of Piedmont. This led to a gradual reduction of the possessions and authority of Humbert III on the Italian side, leaving him with the rump territories of the valleys of Susa and Aosta. In 1174 the emperor pillaged the town of Susa.

In 1187, he was banished from the Holy Roman Empire by Henry VI for supporting the emperor&#x27;s opponents. He did not retire, as has been said, to his Alpine domains, devoting himself in particular to the practice of personal virtues and fraternal charity. He also promoted the foundation of Precettoria of St. Anthony of Ranverso at Buttigliera Alta, not far from the town of Avigliana, entrusting it to Antoniani from Vienne, France.

==Death==
The death of Humbert III, 4 March 1189 in Chambéry, Savoy at the age of fifty-two, was mourned sincerely by all the people. He was the first prince of Savoy to be buried in Hautecombe Abbey, which has since become a burial place for the dynasty.

==Veneration==

The spirituality of Humbert undoubtedly blossomed in an environment of ancient Christian traditions, favoured especially by the example of his father, a pilgrim and crusader in the Holy Land, and of his tutor, Amadeus, Bishop of Lausanne. However, Humbert&#x27;s life was full of contradictions: He was a lover of peace but had frequent hostilities and wars. He was penitent, ascetic, and contemplative, but was forced to take the reins of government, during which time he had a life of action, and found himself forced into marriage in order to have an heir. However, he let unmistakable signs of great moral balance, severity with himself and indulgence and love of neighbour. He was a benefactor to churches, monasteries, and charitable causes, the care of the poor. Throughout his life, he supported Hautecombe Abbey. In 1188 he founded the Monastery of Sant&#x27;Antonio di Ranverso.

Humbert was venerated by many immediately after his death. Miracles were reportedly wrought through his intercession. In Aosta, he is depicted on the facade of the city&#x27;s cathedral. He is mentioned by Alphonsus Ligouri as a particularly pious monk.

In 1838, Charles Albert, King of Sardinia and his descendant, succeeded in having him beatified by Pope Gregory XVI. The king&#x27;s efforts on behalf of Boniface of Savoy, Archbishop of Canterbury, also succeeded. In Italy, Humbert is still remembered in particular at Racconigi, where the Royal Sanctuary of the Madonna delle Grazie houses a picture of him.

==Family==
Humbert had four wives:&lt;br&gt;
1. Faidiva of Toulouse (d. c. 1154) daughter of Alphonse Jourdain, Count of Toulouse

2. Gertrude of Flanders (m. abt. 1155). The marriage was annulled, she was confined to a convent, later freed, and returned to the court of her brother, Philip of Flanders

3. Clementia of Zähringen (married 1164), daughter of Conrad I, Duke of Zähringen. They had two daughters:
::* Sofia, (1165–1202), married Azzo VI of Este
::* Alicia, (1166–1178), betrothed to John of England

4. Beatrice of Viennois and had one son:
::* Thomas (born 1178)

<text>Michael Andrew Fox (born June 9, 1961), known professionally as Michael J. Fox, is a Canadian and American activist and retired actor. Beginning his career as a child actor in the 1970s, he rose to prominence portraying Alex P. Keaton on the NBC sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot; (1982–1989) and Marty McFly in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film trilogy (1985–1990). Fox went on to star in films such as &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; (1985), &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; (1987), &quot;Casualties of War&quot; (1989), &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Frighteners&quot; (1996). He returned to television on the ABC sitcom &quot;Spin City&quot; in the lead role of Mike Flaherty (1996–2000).

In 1998, Fox disclosed his 1991 diagnosis of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He subsequently became an advocate for finding a cure, and founded the Michael J. Fox Foundation in 2000 to help fund research. Worsening symptoms forced him to reduce his acting work.

Fox voiced the lead roles in the &quot;Stuart Little&quot; films (1999–2005) and the animated film &quot;&quot; (2001). He continued to make guest appearances on television, including comedy-drama &quot;Rescue Me&quot; (2009), the legal drama &quot;The Good Wife&quot; (2010–2016) and spin-off &quot;The Good Fight&quot; (2020), and the comedy series &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; (2011, 2017). Fox&#x27;s last major role was the lead on the short-lived sitcom &quot;The Michael J. Fox Show&quot; (2013–2014). He officially retired in 2020 due to his declining health.

Fox has won five Emmy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and a Grammy Award. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2010, and was inducted to Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 2000 and the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2002. For his advocacy of a cure for Parkinson&#x27;s disease, he received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences in 2022 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2025.

== Early life ==
Fox was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, on June 9, 1961, the son of Phyllis (&quot;née&quot; Piper) and William Nelson Fox. William was a 25-year veteran of the Canadian Forces who later became a police dispatcher, while Phyllis was a payroll clerk and actress. Fox is of English and Northern Irish descent; his maternal grandparents were from England and Belfast, Northern Ireland.

Fox&#x27;s family lived in various cities and towns across Canada due to his father&#x27;s career. They moved to Burnaby, a city outside of Vancouver, when his father retired in 1971. His father died of a heart attack on January 6, 1990. His mother died in September 2022. Fox attended Burnaby Central Secondary School, and has a theatre named for him at Burnaby South Secondary. At age 16, Fox starred in the Canadian television series &quot;Leo and Me&quot;, produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and in 1979, at age 18, he moved to Los Angeles to further his acting career. Shortly after his 1988 marriage, he moved back to Vancouver.

Fox was discovered by producer Ronald Shedlo and made his American debut in the television film &quot;Letters from Frank&quot;, credited under the name &quot;Michael Fox&quot;. However, when he registered with the Screen Actors Guild, he discovered that Michael Fox, a veteran actor, was already registered under that name. Fox explained in his autobiography &quot;Lucky Man: A Memoir&quot;:

== Acting career ==
=== Early career ===

Fox&#x27;s first feature film roles were &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; (1980) and &quot;Class of 1984&quot; (1982), credited in both as Michael Fox. Shortly afterward, he began playing &quot;Young Republican&quot; Alex P. Keaton in the show &quot;Family Ties&quot;, which aired on NBC for seven seasons from 1982 to 1989. In an interview with Jimmy Fallon in April 2014, Fox stated he negotiated the role at a payphone at Pioneer Chicken. He received the role only after Matthew Broderick was unavailable. &quot;Family Ties&quot; had been sold to the television network using the pitch &quot;Hip parents, square kids&quot;, with the parents originally intended to be the main characters. However, the positive reaction to Fox&#x27;s performance led to his character&#x27;s becoming the focus of the show following the fourth episode. Fox won three Emmy Awards for &quot;Family Ties&quot; in 1986, 1987, and 1988. He won a Golden Globe Award in 1989.

Brandon Tartikoff, one of the show&#x27;s producers, felt that Fox was too short in relation to the actors playing his parents, and tried to have him replaced. Tartikoff reportedly said that &quot;this is not the kind of face you&#x27;ll ever find on a lunchbox.&quot; After his later successes, Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom-made lunchbox with the inscription &quot;To Brandon: This is for you to put your crow in. Love and Kisses, Michael J.&quot; Tartikoff kept the lunchbox in his office for the rest of his NBC career.

When Fox left the television series &quot;Spin City&quot; in 2000, his final episodes made numerous allusions to &quot;Family Ties&quot;: Michael Gross (who played Alex&#x27;s father Steven) portrays Mike Flaherty&#x27;s (Fox&#x27;s character&#x27;s) therapist, and there is a reference to an off-screen character named &quot;Mallory&quot;. Also, when Flaherty becomes an environmental lobbyist in Washington, D.C., he meets a conservative senator from Ohio named Alex P. Keaton, and in one episode Meredith Baxter played Mike&#x27;s mother.

As a result of working on &quot;Family Ties&quot;, as well as his acting in &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, Fox became a teen idol. The VH1 television series &quot;The Greatest&quot; later named him among their &quot;50 Greatest Teen Idols&quot;.

=== Film career ===
In January 1985, Fox was cast to replace Eric Stoltz as Marty McFly, a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time from 1985 to 1955 in &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. Director Robert Zemeckis originally wanted Fox to play Marty, but Gary David Goldberg, the creator of &quot;Family Ties&quot;, on which Fox was working at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox. Goldberg felt that, as Meredith Baxter was on maternity leave at the time, Fox&#x27;s character Alex Keaton was needed to carry the show in her absence. Stoltz was cast and was already filming &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved.

Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox, whose schedule was now more open with the return of Baxter. During filming, Fox rehearsed for &quot;Family Ties&quot; from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; he then rushed to the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; set, where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30 a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was both a critical and commercial success. The film spent eight consecutive weekends as the number-one movie at the US box office in 1985, and it eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million. &quot;Variety&quot; applauded the performances, opining that Fox and his co-star Christopher Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown&#x27;s friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. Fox&#x27;s performance in particular was praised, earning him a nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 43rd Golden Globe Awards. The film was followed by two successful sequels, &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989) and &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; (1990), which were produced at the same time but released separately. While filming the scene where Buford &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen tries to hang Marty in &quot;Part III&quot;, Fox was allowed to perform the stunt himself as long as he knew where to put his hand on the noose to keep himself from choking; however, on the third take, Fox accidentally placed his hand in the wrong spot, which resulted in him choking, passing out, and nearly dying until Zemeckis noticed him in peril and had him cut down.

During and immediately after the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy, Fox starred in &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; (1985),&quot; Light of Day&quot; (1987), &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; (1987), &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; (1988), and &quot;Casualties of War&quot; (1989).

In &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot;, Fox played a recent graduate from Kansas State University who moves to New York City, where he deals with the ups and downs of the business world. The film was successful at the box office, grossing $110 million worldwide. Roger Ebert in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Fox provides a fairly desperate center for the film. It could not have been much fun for him to follow the movie&#x27;s arbitrary shifts of mood, from sitcom to slapstick, from sex farce to boardroom brawls.&quot;

In &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;, Fox played a fact-checker for a New York magazine who spends his nights partying with alcohol and drugs. The film received mixed reviews, with Hal Hinson in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticizing Fox by claiming that &quot;he was the wrong actor for the job&quot;. Meanwhile, Roger Ebert praised the actor&#x27;s performance: &quot;Fox is very good in the central role (he has a long drunken monologue that is the best thing he has ever done in a movie)&quot;. During the shooting of &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;, Fox co-starred again with Tracy Pollan, his on-screen girlfriend from &quot;Family Ties&quot;.

Fox then starred in &quot;Casualties of War&quot;, a dark and violent war drama about the Vietnam War, alongside Sean Penn. &quot;Casualties of War&quot; was not a major box office hit, but Fox was praised for his performance. Don Willmott wrote: &quot;Fox, only one year beyond his &quot;Family Ties&quot; sitcom silliness, rises to the challenges of acting as the film&#x27;s moral voice and sharing scenes with the always intimidating Penn.&quot; While &quot;Family Ties&quot; was ending, his production company Snowback Productions set up a two-year production pact at Paramount Pictures to develop film and television projects.

In 1991, he starred in &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot;, a romantic comedy about a talented medical doctor who decides to become a plastic surgeon. While moving from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, he winds up as a doctor in a small southern town in South Carolina. Michael Caton-Jones, of &quot;Time Out&quot;, described Fox in the film as &quot;at his frenetic best&quot;. &quot;The Hard Way&quot; was also released in 1991, with Fox playing an undercover actor learning from police officer James Woods. After being privately diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1991 and being cautioned he had &quot;ten good working years left&quot;, Fox hastily signed a three-film contract, appearing in &quot;For Love or Money&quot; (1993), &quot;Life with Mikey&quot; (1993), and &quot;Greedy&quot; (1994). In the mid-1990s Fox played smaller supporting roles in &quot;The American President&quot; (1995) and &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996).

His last major film role was in &quot;The Frighteners&quot; (1996), directed by Peter Jackson. Fox&#x27;s performance received critical praise, Kenneth Turan in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote; &quot;The film&#x27;s actors are equally pleasing. Both Fox, in his most successful starring role in some time, and [Trini] Alvarado, who looks rather like Andie MacDowell here, have no difficulty getting into the manic spirit of things.&quot;

He voiced the American Bulldog Chance in Disney&#x27;s live-action film &quot;Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey&quot; and its sequel &quot;Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco&quot;, the titular character in &quot;Stuart Little&quot; and its two sequels &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; and &quot;Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild&quot;, and Milo James Thatch in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;&quot;.

=== Later career and retirement ===

&quot;Spin City&quot; ran from 1996 to 2002 on American television network ABC. The show depicted a fictional New York City government, originally starring Fox as Deputy Mayor Mike Flaherty. Fox won an Emmy Award for &quot;Spin City&quot; in 2000, three Golden Globe Awards in 1998, 1999, and 2000, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards in 1999 and 2000. During the third season, Fox told the cast and crew of the show that he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and during the fourth season, he announced his retirement from the show. A character played by Charlie Sheen replaced his, and he made three more appearances during the final season. In 2002, his Lottery Hill Entertainment production company attempted to set up a pilot for ABC with DreamWorks Television and Touchstone Television company via first-look agreements, but it never went to series.

In 2004, Fox guest-starred in two episodes of the comedy-drama &quot;Scrubs&quot; – created by &quot;Spin City&quot; creator Bill Lawrence – as Dr. Kevin Casey, a surgeon with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. In 2006, he appeared in four episodes of &quot;Boston Legal&quot; as a lung cancer patient. The producers brought him back in a recurring role for season three, beginning with the season premiere. Fox was nominated for an Emmy Award for best guest appearance.

In 2009, Fox appeared in five episodes of the television series &quot;Rescue Me&quot; which earned him an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. Starting in 2010, Fox played a recurring role in the American drama &quot;The Good Wife&quot; as crafty attorney Louis Canning and earned Emmy nominations for three consecutive years. In 2011, Fox portrayed himself in the eighth season of Larry David&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, in which David&#x27;s fictionalized self becomes Fox&#x27;s neighbor and accuses him of using his Parkinson&#x27;s disease as a manipulative tool. Fox returned in 2017 for a brief appearance, referencing his prior time on the show.

In August 2012, NBC announced that Fox would star in &quot;The Michael J. Fox Show&quot;, loosely based on his life. It was granted a 22-episode commitment from the network and premiered in September 2013, but was taken off the air after 15 episodes and later cancelled.

Fox has made several appearances in other media. At the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, he delivered comedy monologues, along with William Shatner and Catherine O&#x27;Hara, in the &quot;I am Canadian&quot; part of the show.

Despite sound-alike A.J. LoCascio voicing Marty McFly in the 2011 &quot;Back to the Future&quot; episodic adventure game, Fox lent his likeness to the in-game version of Marty alongside Christopher Lloyd. Fox made a special guest appearance in the final episode of the series as an elder version of Marty, as well as his great-grandfather Willie McFly.

Fox appeared in five episodes of the second season of the ABC political drama &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;, in the recurring role of Ethan West, investigating whether the president was fit to continue in the job.

In 2020, Fox retired from acting due to the increasing unreliability of his speech. Fox&#x27;s memoir, &quot;No Time Like the Future: An Optimist Considers Mortality&quot;, was released that November. In the book, Fox explained that, &quot;not being able to speak reliably is a game-breaker for an actor&quot; and that he was experiencing memory loss. Fox wrote, &quot;There is a time for everything, and my time of putting in a 12-hour workday, and memorizing seven pages of dialogue, is best behind me...I enter a second retirement. That could change, because everything changes. But if this is the end of my acting career, so be it.&quot;

In 2021, Fox appeared in one episode of the television series &quot;Expedition: Back to the Future&quot;, as well as in the animated film &quot;Back Home Again&quot;. On May 12, 2023, &quot;&quot;, a documentary which follows his career and Parkinson&#x27;s disease diagnosis, was released. The film was directed by Davis Guggenheim and made for Apple TV+. It was positively received, winning four of the seven awards it was nominated for at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards. Stephanie Zacharek on behalf of &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie&quot; reminds us that a person stricken with a disease doesn&#x27;t &quot;become&quot; that disease... What&#x27;s striking about &quot;Still&quot; is how celebratory it is. This isn&#x27;t the story of a wonderful actor felled by an illness; it&#x27;s the story of a wonderful actor,&quot; while Mark Kermode of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;An intimate, uplifting star portrait.&quot;

On June 29, 2024, he was featured on the Glastonbury Festival as a guest of British rock band Coldplay, playing the guitar with them on the songs &quot;Humankind&quot; and &quot;Fix You&quot;. Lead singer and pianist Chris Martin mentioned during the show that &quot;&quot;Back to the Future&quot; is the main reason we became a band&quot;.

== Other work ==
Fox served as an executive producer of &quot;Spin City&quot; alongside co-creators Bill Lawrence and Gary David Goldberg.

Fox has authored four books: &quot;Lucky Man: A Memoir&quot; (2002), &quot;Always Looking Up: The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist&quot; (2009), &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Future: Twists and Turns and Lessons Learned&quot; (2010), and &quot;No Time Like the Future: An Optimist Considers Mortality&quot; (2020).

== Personal life ==
Fox met his wife, Tracy Pollan, when she played the role of his girlfriend, Ellen, on &quot;Family Ties&quot;. They were married on July 16, 1988, at West Mountain Inn in Arlington, Vermont. The couple have four children: one son and three daughters. Shortly before the couple&#x27;s marriage, Fox purchased an estate named Lottery Hill Farm in South Woodstock, Vermont, which he listed in 2012. In 1997, Fox purchased an apartment on Fifth Avenue within the Manhattan neighbourhood of Upper East Side, where he and his family lived primarily until 2020. The same year, Fox and Pollan built an estate in Sharon, Connecticut, which he listed in 2016. In 2007, Fox purchased a house in Quogue, New York, where he and his family lived part-time and spent the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Fox sold the house and moved to Santa Barbara, California, with his family; they took up residence in Malibu several months later.

Fox became a US citizen in 2000 but retains his Canadian citizenship. He provided a light-hearted segment during the 2010 Winter Olympics&#x27; closing ceremony in Vancouver on February 28, 2010, when he expressed how proud he is to be Canadian. On June 4, 2010, the city of Burnaby granted him the Freedom of the City. Fox endorsed Pete Buttigieg prior to the 2020 United States presidential election.

=== Parkinson&#x27;s disease ===
Fox started displaying symptoms of early-onset Parkinson&#x27;s disease in early 1991 while shooting the film &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot; and was diagnosed shortly thereafter. Though his initial symptoms were only a twitching little finger and a sore shoulder, he was told that within a few years he would not be able to work. The causes of Parkinson&#x27;s disease are not well understood, and may include genetic and environmental factors. Fox is one of at least four members of the cast and crew of &quot;Leo and Me&quot; who developed early-onset Parkinson&#x27;s. According to Fox, this is not enough people to be defined as a cluster so it has not been well researched. In 2020, he told Hadley Freeman of &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;I can think of a thousand possible scenarios: I used to go fishing in a river near paper mills and eat the salmon I caught; I&#x27;ve been to a lot of farms; I smoked a lot of pot in high school when the government was poisoning the crops. But you can drive yourself crazy trying to figure it out.&quot;
After his diagnosis, Fox began drinking heavily and grew depressed. In 1992, he eventually sought help and stopped drinking altogether. Fox went public with his Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1998 and has become a strong advocate for Parkinson&#x27;s disease research. His foundation, The Michael J. Fox Foundation, was created to help advance every promising research path to curing Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Since 2010, he has led a $100-million effort, which is the Foundation&#x27;s landmark observational study, to discover the biological markers of Parkinson&#x27;s disease with the Parkinson&#x27;s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).

Fox manages the symptoms of his Parkinson&#x27;s disease with the drug carbidopa/levodopa. He had a thalamotomy in 1998.

His first book, &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, focused on how, after seven years of denial of the disease, he set up the Michael J. Fox Foundation, stopped drinking and became an advocate for people living with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, Fox wrote that he did not take his medication prior to his testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee in 1999 (partial C-SPAN video clip).
In an interview with NPR in April 2002, Fox explained what he does when he becomes symptomatic:

In 2006, Fox starred in a campaign ad for then-State Auditor of Missouri Claire McCaskill in her successful 2006 Senate campaign against incumbent Jim Talent, expressing her support for embryonic stem cell research. In the ad, he visibly showed the effects of his Parkinson&#x27;s disease:

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;one of the most powerful and talked about political advertisements in years&quot; and polls indicated that the commercial had a measurable impact on the way voters voted, in an election that McCaskill won. His second book, &quot;Always Looking Up: The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist&quot;, describes his life between 1999 and 2009, with much of the book centered on how Fox got into campaigning for stem cell research. On March 31, 2009, Fox appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; with Mehmet Oz to discuss his condition as well as his book, his family and his primetime special, which aired May 7, 2009, (&quot;Michael J. Fox: Adventures of an Incurable Optimist&quot;).

His work led him to be named one of the 100 people &quot;whose power, talent or moral example is transforming the world&quot; in 2007 by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. On March 5, 2010, Fox received an honorary doctorate in medicine from Karolinska Institute for his contributions to research in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He received an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of British Columbia.

On May 31, 2012, he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the Justice Institute of British Columbia to recognize his accomplishments as a performer as well as his commitment to raising research funding and awareness for Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Fox recalled performing in role-playing simulations as part of police recruit training exercises at the Institute early in his career.

In 2016, his organization created a raffle to raise awareness for Parkinson&#x27;s disease and raised $6.75 million, with the help of Nike, Inc. via two auctions, one in Hong Kong and the other in London.

At the 2022 Governors Awards, Fox was awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for his efforts in fighting Parkinson&#x27;s, having raised over $1 billion for research. The award was presented by friend Woody Harrelson.

In a 2023 interview with Jane Pauley on &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot;, Fox said, &quot;I&#x27;m not gonna lie. It&#x27;s getting harder. Every day it&#x27;s tougher.&quot; He said he has had spinal surgery for a benign tumor and has broken bones in several falls.

His life is the subject of &quot;&quot;, a 2023 documentary film by Davis Guggenheim for Apple TV+.

He was named in &quot;Time Magazine&quot;&#x27;s 2024 list of influential people in health.

<text>Uriah (or Urijah in some older English translations) is a prophet and martyr mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah.

== Biblical narrative ==
He is described as being the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-Jearim. During the reign of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, he fled into Egypt from the cruelty of the king, but having been brought back he was beheaded and his body &quot;cast into the graves of the common people.&quot;

== Lachish Letters ==
While it is not certain, there is a scholarly opinion that Uriah might be referenced in the Lachish letters. See Lachish letters.

<text>Tyropoeon Valley (Greek: i.e., &quot;Valley of the Cheesemakers&quot; or &quot;Cheesemongers&quot;), is the name given by the first-century Jewish-Roman historian Josephus (Wars 5.140) to the valley or rugged ravine, which in his times separated Jerusalem&#x27;s Temple Mount (Mount Moriah) from the Western Hill or Mount Zion, and emptied into the valley of Hinnom. In modern scholarly terms it is also known as the central valley/Central Valley of Jerusalem, Israel.

== Names, etymology ==
In the ancient Copper Scroll this valley is called in Hebrew the Outer Valley (3Q15 col.8, line 4).

The name used by Josephus, (), possibly arose as an ancient mistranslation from Hebrew to the Greek of Josephus&#x27;s book; Semitic languages use the same root for &quot;outer&quot; and &quot;congeal&quot;.

==Description, history==
The Tyropoeon, filled over the centuries with a vast accumulation of debris, and almost a plain, was spanned by bridges, the most noted of which was Zion Bridge, which was probably the ordinary means of communication between the royal palace on Zion and the temple.

The western wall of the Temple Mount rose up from the bottom of this valley to the height of 84 feet, where it was on a level with the area, and above this, and as a continuance of it, the wall of Solomon&#x27;s cloister rose to the height of about 50 feet, &quot;so that this section of the wall would originally present to view a stupendous mass of masonry scarcely to be surpassed by any mural masonry in the world.&quot;

<text>Telecommunications in Armenia involves the availability and use of electronic devices and services, such as the telephone, television, radio or computer, for the purpose of communication. The various telecommunications systems found and used in Armenia includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the internet.

==Mobile==
As of 2017, Armenia has 3.5 million mobile subscribers in total, and a 120% penetration rate.
There are three mobile phone operators currently in Armenia: Viva, Team and Ucom. All three offer both 2G and 3G as well as 4G services. All three networks are widely modern and reliable with shops located in major towns and cities where one can purchase a sim card or get assistance if needed. Most unlocked mobile phones are able to be used on roaming, however, network charges apply. Ucom and Viva are often recommended to tourists due to the variety of tariffs available and the help available in a variety of languages.

As of 2012, approximately 90% of all main lines are digitized. The remaining 10% is in modernization process.

===International system===
Yerevan is connected to the Trans-Asia-Europe fiber-optic cable via Georgia. Additional international service is available by microwave radio relay and landline connections to other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Moscow international switch and by satellite.
The main backbones of Armenian networks are made by E3 or STM-1 lines via microwave units across whole country with many passive retranslations.

== Wire telephone services ==
Traditionally, Armenia has well-developed landline telephone services. According to official statistic data of the International Telecommunication Union, as of 2017 there were 505,190 fixed telephone service subscribers in Armenia (residents and businesses) or 17.24 subscribers per 100 inhabitants. The number of fixed telephone users have significantly declined as compared with the previous 10 years from 20.41 in 2006. The main reason for the decline is mobile-fixed substitution.

==Radio==

As of 2008, Armenia has 9 AM stations, 17 FM stations, and one shortwave station. Additionally, there are approximately 850,000 radios in existence.
The primary network provider is TRBNA.

==Television==

Armenia has 48 private television stations alongside 2 public networks with major Russian channels widely available throughout the country. In 2008, TRBNA upgraded the main circuit to a digital distribution system based on DVB-IP and MPEG2 standards. According to the Television Association Committee of Armenia, TV penetration rate is 80% according to 2011 data.

==Internet==
, there were approximately 1,400,000 Internet users and approximately 65,279 Internet hosts in Armenia. The country code (Top level domain) for Armenia is .am, which has been used for AM radio stations and for domain hacks.

The national communications company Armentel&#x27;s (now Telecom Armenia OJSC) only fiber optic connection to the Internet enters Armenia through Georgia (via Marneuli) and then connects to the rest of the Internet via an undersea fiber-optic cable in the Black Sea. Armenia is connected to the Trans-Asia-Europe fiber-optic cable system via Georgia, which runs along the railroad from Poti to Tbilisi to the Armenian border near Marneuli. At Poti, the TAE cable connects to the undersea Georgia-Russia system KAFOS which then connects to the Black Sea Fiber Optic Cable System. The BSFOCS is co-owned by Armentel.
GNC-Alfa is the largest independent internet and data provider in Armenia with 1,500 km fibre-optic cable infrastructure, and covering 70% of Armenia.

===Dial-up===
Dial-up was the main type of connectivity in Armenia for several years. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) supported dial-up internet, starting with an office in Armenia in 1997, and developing a network called &quot;Freenet&quot; that reached 6000 users by the year 2000, with 1000 websites and each user having 3 Mb of email storage space and 3 Mb of website storage. By 2004, usage grew to 21,000 users and 3000 websites, with increased storage. A local &quot;Yerevan Internet Exchange&quot; was established, initial based on radio connections and by 2004 mostly on DSL connections. The UNDP viewed the role of the internet as promoting democracy, with online forums discussing human rights, the environment, political parties and the Armenian constitution. In 2008, dial-up connections expanded when Telecom Armenia OJSC (Beeline TM) started operation of an ADSL network and together with VivaCell-MTS (now Viva Armenia) and Orange Armenia also introduced portable USB-modems, which are operated mainly in 3G networks and are still very popular in rural areas especially in small mountainous villages where landline connectivity is not available.

===Broadband===
According to official statistics from the International Telecommunication Union, the number of broadband subscribers in Armenia in 2017 was 315,319 users or 10.76 users per 100 persons.

====ADSL====
A major part of DSL connectivity is offered by Telecom Armenia OJSC (Beeline TM). Some other ISPs (Arminco, WEB, Bionet and others) also offer DSL connectivities mainly using leased infrastructure of Telecom Armenia OJSC.

====WiMAX====
Rapid development of WiMAX was recorded in 2008–2010. Two WiMAX providers, namely Icon Communications and Cornet Ltd. operating in the 3.6–3.8 GHz band using IEEE 802.16e reached 2000 users each, but shortly disappeared from the market due to strong competition with ADSL and FTTB operators. Cornet was closed and Icon Communications was acquired by Telecom Armenia OJSC (Beeline TM).

====FTTB====
Fibre to the building broadband connectivity is offered by at least four major operators, namely Viva Armenia, Ucom, Telecom Armenia OJSC (operated under Beeline TM) and GNC-Alfa (operated under Rostelecom TM). All three companies offer triple play services including internet, IPTV and telephone services.

===Internet censorship===
Listed as engaged in substantial filtering in the political area and selective filtering in the social, conflict/security, and internet tools areas by the OpenNet Initiative (ONI) in November 2010.

Access to the internet in Armenia is largely unfettered, although evidence of second and third-generation filtering is mounting. Armenia&#x27;s political climate is volatile and largely unpredictable. In times of political unrest, the government has not hesitated to put in place restrictions on the internet as a means to curtail public protest and discontent. According to Article 11 of the Law of the Republic of Armenia on Police, law enforcement has the right to block content to prevent criminal activity.

Armenia&#x27;s internet access is delivered by Russian providers, occasionally resulting in censorship by Russian ISPs. In 2012 Russian authorities blocked kavkazcenter.com, resulting in it being blocked in Armenia. In 2014 five other websites were blocked due to filtering by the Russian telecommunications regulator Roskomnadzor. ISPs claimed the blocks were due to technical error and were removed.

===2011 Armenian internet outage===
The 2011 Armenian internet outage occurred in April 2011 when an elderly woman from Georgia accidentally cut through an underground cable giving internet access to Armenia.

== International cooperation ==
Armenia is a member of the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization, the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, and the International Amateur Radio Union.

Armenia has also ratified the Convention on Cybercrime and the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union.

In 2019, Armenia joined the &quot;EU&#x27;s Cybersecurity East Project&quot; by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity. The project aims at improving cybersecurity and fostering cooperation with the EU.

<doc id="68911" wikidata="Q4411276" url="?curid=68911" title="Telecommunications in Australia">
<text>Telecommunications in Australia refers to communication in Australia through electronic means, using devices such as telephone, television, radio or computer, and services such as the telephony and broadband networks. Telecommunications have always been important in Australia given the &quot;tyranny of distance&quot; with a dispersed population. Governments have driven telecommunication development and have a key role in its regulation.

==History==
===Colonial period===

Prior to Federation of Australia in 1901, each of the six Australian colonies had its own telephony communications network. The Australian networks were government assets operating under colonial legislation modelled on that of Britain. The UK Telegraph Act 1868 for example empowered the Postmaster-General to &quot;acquire, maintain and work electric telegraphs&quot; and foreshadowed the 1870 nationalisation of competing British telegraph companies.

Australia&#x27;s first telephone service (connecting the Melbourne and South Melbourne offices of Robinson Brothers, a Melbourne engineering firm) was launched in 1879. The private Melbourne Telephone Exchange Company opened Australia&#x27;s first telephone exchange in August 1880. Around 7,757 calls were handled in 1884.

The nature of the networks meant that regulation in Australia was undemanding: network personnel were government employees or agents, legislation was enhanced on an incremental basis and restrictions could be achieved through infrastructure. All the colonies ran their telegraph networks at a deficit through investment in infrastructure and subsidisation of regional access, generally with bipartisan support.

Government-operated post office and telegraph networks – the largest parts of the bureaucracy – were combined into a single department in each colony on the model of the UK Post Office: South Australia in 1869, Victoria in 1870, Queensland in 1880 and New South Wales in 1893.

===At Federation (1901)===
At Federation, the colonial networks (staff, switches, wires, handsets, buildings etc.) were transferred to the Commonwealth Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department responsible for domestic postal, telephone and, telegraph services becoming the responsibility of the first Postmaster-General (PMG), a federal. With 16,000 staff (and assets of over £6 million) the PMG accounted for 80% of the new federal bureaucracy.

Public phones were available in a handful of post offices. Subscriber telephones were initially restricted to major businesses, government agencies, institutions and wealthier residences. Eight million telegrams were sent that year over 43,000 miles of line.

There were around 33,000 phones across Australia, with 7,502 telephone subscribers in inner Sydney and 4,800 in the Melbourne central business district.

Overseas cable links to Australia remained in private hands, reflecting the realities of imperial politics, demands on the new government&#x27;s resources, and perceptions of its responsibilities.

===After Federation===
A trunk line between Melbourne (headquarters of the PMG Department) and Sydney was established in 1907, with extension to Adelaide in 1914, Brisbane in 1923, Perth in 1930 and Hobart in 1935.

On 12 July 1906 the first Australian wireless overseas messages were sent between Point Lonsdale, Victoria and Devonport, Tasmania. Australia and New Zealand ratified the 1906 Berlin Radio-telegraph Convention in 1907. The PMG department became responsible for some international shortwave services, particularly from the 1920s and for a new Coastal Radio Service in 1911, with the first of a network of stations operational in February 1912.

The Sydney–Melbourne co-axial cable was officially opened on 9 April 1962.
The coaxial cable infrastructure supported the introduction of subscriber trunk dialling between the cities and live television link-ups. After its commissioning in April 1962 the cable carried telegraph and telephone traffic. It also provided the first inter-city television transmission in Australia, allowing simultaneous television broadcasting in Melbourne and Sydney for the first time.

Optus was formed as AUSSAT, a government owned corporation, in 1981. It was privatized later in the 1980s under the Hawke Labor government. Telstra (previously known as Telecom), another government owned asset, was also privatized in 1997 under the Howard Liberal government.

==Broadcasting in Australia==

Australia developed its own radio broadcasting system, through its own engineers, manufacturers, retailers, newspapers, entertainment services, and news agencies. Initially hobbyists and amateurs were dominant, however with the Commonwealth Government setting up the first radio system, and business interests becoming increasingly involved, hobbyists and amateurs were marginalised. The Australian Labor Party was especially interested in radio because it allowed them to bypass the newspapers, which were mostly controlled by their opposition. Both parties agreed on the need for a national system, and in 1932 set up the Australian Broadcasting Commission was set up as a government agency largely separate from political interference.

The first commercial broadcasters, originally known as &quot;B&quot; class stations were on the air as early as 1925. Many were sponsored by newspapers in Australia, by theatrical interests, by amateur radio enthusiasts and radio retailers, and by retailers generally. Almost all Australians were within reach of a station by the 1930s, and the number of stations remained relatively stable through the post-war era. However, in the 1970s, the Labor government under Prime Minister Gough Whitlam commenced a broadcasting renaissance so that by the 1990s there were 50 different radio services available for groups based on tastes, languages, religion, or geography. The broadcasting system was largely deregulated in 1992, except that there were limits on foreign ownership and on monopolistic control. By 2000, 99 percent of Australians owned at least one television set, and averaged 20 hours a week watching it.

===Television===
As early as 1929, two Melbourne commercial radio stations, 3UZ and 3DB were conducting experimental mechanical television broadcasts – these were conducted in the early hours of the morning, after the radio stations had officially closed down. In 1934 Dr Val McDowall at amateur station 4CM Brisbane conducted experiments in electronic television.

Television broadcasting officially began in Sydney and Melbourne just prior to the Melbourne Olympic Games in November/December 1956 and then phased in at other capital cities, and then into rural markets. Many forms of entertainment, particularly drama and variety, proved more suited to television than radio, so the actors and producers migrated there.

It now includes a broad range of public, commercial, community, subscription, narrowcast, and amateur stations across the country. Colour television in the PAL 625-line format went to a full-time basis in 1975. Subscription television, on the Galaxy platform, began in 1995. Digital terrestrial television was introduced in 2001.

Australia moved from PAL 625 to DVB-T on 10 December 2013.

Subscription television, whether Foxtel or Netflix type services, has become more important and is one factor driving demand for the National Broadband Network.

==Core technologies, the network, backhaul and the local loop==
===Copper cable and optical fibre networks===

Prior to the government opening telecommunications to multi player competition the PMG (and later Telecom Australia) operated a vertically integrated system, providing the Core network, backhaul, ancillary networks and a range of services to end users.

With opening telecommunications to multi provider competition the government required Telstra to sell wholesale access to its core facilities and networks.

In the 2000s, larger ISPs began taking over more of the delivery infrastructure themselves by taking advantage of regulated access to the unconditioned local loop. As well as significantly reducing costs, it gave the service providers complete control of their own service networks, other than the copper pair (phone line from the exchange to the customer).

Telstra in 2006 proposed replacing its copper network with an optical fibre node network with the drop connection into end user premises being the existing copper cable. They abandoned this as under competition policy they would be required to open their network to competing carriers on a wholesale basis.

Further options were explored with the first Rudd government deciding to set up a National Broadband Network using Fibre to the Premises as the main carrier network, supported by satellite and wireless to remote areas.

After the election of the Abbott government in 2013 a Multi Technological Mix was implemented, replacing FTTP where development was yet to start with Fibre to the Node and also repurposing the Telstra and Optus hybrid fibre-coaxial networks.

===Cable===

In the late 1990s, Telstra and Optus rolled-out separate cable Internet services, focusing on the east coast.

===Satellite===
The Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) was established by Australia in August 1946 with responsibility for all international telecommunications services into, through and out of Australia.

In 1981 Aussat Pty Ltd was established as a GBE to operate domestic satellite telecommunication and broadcasting services. Aussat&#x27;s charter restricted it from acting as a competitor to Telecom, including a prohibition on interconnecting public switched traffic with Telecom&#x27;s network.

Proposals for a merger of Aussat and OTC (thereby permitting national delivery of telecommunication services in competition with Telecom) were rejected in favor of disposal of the satellite operator to a non-government entity that would be allowed to compete with Telecom.

Satellites are used to provide telecommunications services in very remote areas. These are primarily the Optus satellites C1 D1 and D2.

There are also a number of satellite earth stations, which provide access points into the Australian networks:
*Intelsat has 10 earth stations, 4 for the Indian Ocean and 6 for the Pacific Ocean.
*Inmarsat has 2 earth stations, which serve the Indian and Pacific Ocean regions.
*SingTel Optus Earth Stations has several earth stations located in the major cities.
*Sky Muster satellites operated as part of the National Broadband Network.
*Telstra has a totals of 48 earth stations, Located between sites in Sydney, Perth and Bendigo serving both the Australian Continent, Asia-Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean regions.

===Submarine cables===
Due to Australia&#x27;s large size, sparse population, and relative remoteness to other countries, a significant amount of infrastructure is required for Internet communications. The vast majority of Australia&#x27;s international telecommunications transit capacity is sourced from undersea several fibre-optic cables to Asia and the US: 
*Southern Cross Cables to New Zealand, Hawaii and the US mainland with a capacity of 620 Gbit/s, with planned upgrade in Q2 2012.

==Telephony and related arrangements==

The Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department regulated telecommunications and operated telephone and related communications within Australia over the copper telephony network from federation up to 22 December 1975, replaced by the Postal and Telecommunications Department.

In mid-1975 the department was disaggregated by the Whitlam government into the two Government Business Enterprises: the Australian Telecommunications Commission (trading as Telecom Australia) and the Australian Postal Commission (trading as Australia Post) with a new Postal and Telecommunications Department. The change was intended to take account of the increase in the functions of the department to include all electronic media matters which had previously been the responsibility of the Department of the Media.

The 1982 Davidson Inquiry regarding private sector involvement in delivery of existing/proposed telecommunications services recommended ending Telecom Australia&#x27;s monopoly.

In June 1991, legislation was passed allowing duopoly competition with Telstra, Optus Communications became Australia&#x27;s second general telecommunications carrier. It was guaranteed access to Telecom&#x27;s existing infrastructure on reasonable terms - meant to ensure its viability. Other players were prevented from entering the general telephone market until 1997.

Telecom Australia changed its name to Telstra in 1995 and has since been privatised. It faced growing competition in market niches such as long distance corporate voice and data services. Telstra was progressively privatised (33.3% 1997, 16.6% 1999, 33.3% 2006, with 17% transferred to the Future Fund.)

Numbers of licensed telecommunications carriers grew from: ~20 controlling facilities in Australia at 1998 (with several hundred entities providing services using those facilities to end users); to 99 at 2002.

==Regulation==
The Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department regulated telecommunications and operated telephone and related communications within Australia over the copper telephony network from federation up to 22 December 1975, replaced by the Postal and Telecommunications Department.

On 1 July 2005, the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority (ACMA) brought together the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) and the Australian Communications Authority (ACA).

===General censorship===
===Internet censorship===

On 31 December 2007, Stephen Conroy announced the federal government&#x27;s intention to censor &quot;inappropriate material&quot; from the Internet. Under the proposed system any Australian who subscribes to an ISP would receive a &quot;clean&quot; version of the Internet. The Federal Government&#x27;s stated aim is to protect children from accessing violent and pornographic websites. This plan was later abandoned and the Australian government continues to only block websites that violate online laws.

== Internet ==

Permanent Internet access was first available in Australia to universities via AARNet in 1989. The first commercial dial-up Internet Service Provider (ISP) appeared in capital cities soon after, and by the mid-1990s almost the entire country had a range of choices of dial-up ISPs. Today, Internet access is available through a range of technologies, i.e. hybrid fibre coaxial cable, digital subscriber line (DSL), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and satellite Internet. The Australian Government, in partnership with the industrial sector, began rolling out a nationwide FTTP broadband network in July 2009.

The .au domain (ccTLD) was delegated to Robert Elz of the Australian Computing Science Network (ACSNet) in March 1986. From then, universities connected one at a time to allow for the sending and receiving of email and for use newsgroup facilities. An earlier restricted IP-based network, linking academic institutions within Australia, known as ACSNet, used the .oz domain. This domain was subsumed under .au to become .oz.au.

A permanent connection between AARNet and ARPANet was established in May 1989 by a satellite connection.

In 1992 there were two competing commercial ISPs expanding to excess of 100 by June 1995 [Internet Australasia Magazine], attributing some fifth of all AARNet traffic.

The Vice Chancellors&#x27; Committee sold all commercial customers with Telstra leading the commercial push of the Internet into Australia.

===Broadband access===
Broadband internet access is available in Australia using predominantly ADSL, plus cable, fibre, satellite and wireless technologies. Since July 2008 almost two thirds of Australian households have had internet access, with broadband connections outnumbering dial-up two to one. According to the recent ABS statistics the non-dial-up services outnumber dial up services 3.6 to 1.

===xDSL===
In 2000, the first consumer ADSL services were made available via Telstra Bigpond, at speeds of 256/64 kbit/s (downstream/upstream), 512/128 kbit/s, and 1500/256 kbit/s. Telstra chose to artificially limit all ADSL speeds to a maximum of 1500/256 kbit/s. As ADSL required access to the telephone exchange and the copper line – which only Telstra had – this allowed Telstra to be dominant due to the expense of roll-out for other companies and Telstra&#x27;s established customer base. Other ISPs followed suit soon after; reselling connections purchased wholesale from Telstra.

In response to Telstra&#x27;s monopolisation of ADSL provision other carriers installed their own DSLAMs. Internode

The presence of non-Telstra DSLAMs allowed the service providers to control the speed of connection, and most offered &quot;uncapped&quot; speeds, allowing the customers to connect at whatever speed their copper pair would allow, up to 8 Mbit/s. Ratification of ADSL2 and ADSL2+ increased the maximum to 12 Mbit/s, then 24 Mbit/s. 

In November 2007 the first Naked DSL product was announced by iiNet. Shortly after this other internet providers also started to provide DSL products without telephony service over copper, reducing line rental fees.

===Telstra FTTN===
Telstra proposed to upgrade to Fibre to the Node (FTTN) in 2006 but did not pursue the development because it would be required to share the network.

===Wireless broadband===
Wireless broadband in Australia is widespread, with many point-to-point fixed wireless broadband providers serving broadband-poor regional and rural areas, predominantly with Motorola Canopy and WiMAX technologies. Telstra&#x27;s 2006 introduction of the &quot;Next G&quot; HSPA network (which reportedly covers 99% of the Australian population as of September 2008) with speeds advertised of being up to 14 Mbit/s stimulated investment in wireless broadband by competitors Optus, Vodafone and Hutchison Telecommunications, who are presently expanding their HSPA networks to cover 96–98% of the Australian population.
===Rural coverage===

Delivering competitive telecommunications services to regional and rural areas is a major issue, with Telstra having a Universal Service Obligation regarding telephony services. Government monies have been made available on a competitive basis to carriers to address broadband and mobile telephone blackspots and gaps in service provision.

===National Broadband Network===

The National Broadband Network was initially a fibre-to-the-home open-access network in planning and trial operation in Australia by the federal government. The national broadband network aimed to provide up to 1000 Mbit/s speeds and to connect to 93% of Australian households and businesses. This has since been revised under a Coalition government to a mixed-technology system relying largely on Australia&#x27;s existing and largely depreciated copper networks. This revision aims for 50 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s, with consumer reports ranging from 1 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. The government will hold a majority share (51%) in the network company, with the remainder being held by private firms. The Australian government had previously called for proposals to build a fibre-to-the-node broadband network providing download speeds up to 100 and upload speeds up to 40 megabits per second. The government also utilises fixed wireless technology and satellite technology to provide fast broadband connection in rural area and very remote area. Fixed wireless provides speeds up to 50/20 Mbit/s. Satellite technology uses two Sky Muster communication satellites launched in 2015 and 2016 to provide fast broadband in very remote areas and offshore. It provides speeds up to 25/5 Mbit/s.

The network will be the largest single infrastructure investment in Australia&#x27;s history.

== Incidents ==

=== 2023 Optus outage ===

On 8 November 2023 at around 04:00 AEDT, all Optus services, including wireless phone, internet, and mobile, stopped working. This led to over 10 million people and over 400,000 businesses without services provided by the telco. The outage lasted from 9-13 hours, with mobile coverage being the first thing restored.

<text>Telecommunications in Austria encompass highly developed and efficient internet and telephone networks, complemented by a number of radio and television broadcast stations.

In the 2022 Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) report, Austria ranks 10th among 27 European Union (EU) countries. It places 11th in Human Capital, with 63% of individuals possessing at least basic digital skills, surpassing the EU average of 54%. In terms of Connectivity, Austria shows noteworthy advancement with 77% 5G coverage, though it faces challenges in fixed network capacity. The Integration of Digital Technology in businesses is notable, with 64% of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) reaching a basic level of digital intensity, above the EU&#x27;s 55%. Digital Public Services are also well-adopted, with 79% of internet users engaging in e-government services, exceeding the EU average of 65%.

==Infrastructure==

The telephone system is highly developed and efficient. Fibre-optic coverage is extensive, although it remains very expensive. A full range of telephone and Internet services are available via the network.

Austria has 15 satellite earth stations, two Intelsat (one Atlantic Ocean and one Indian Ocean) and one Eutelsat. Additionally, there are around 600 very-small-aperture terminals (VSATs) (2007).

==Internet==

=== User statistics ===
* 37 Internet service providers (ISPs), most of them organised in the local ISP association Internet Service Providers Austria, ISPA.
* 6.7 million Internet users, 50th in the world; 81% of the population, 29th in the world (2012).
* 2,074,252 fixed broadband subscriptions, 41st in the world; 25.2% of the population, 33rd in the world (2012). 
* 4,564,834 mobile subscriptions, 40th in the world; 55.5% of the population, 23rd in the world (2012).
* 3.5 million Internet hosts, 30th in the world (2012).
* 300,000 Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines (ADSL).

The country code for Austria is &quot;AT&quot;, the country code top level domain (ccTLD) is &quot;.at&quot;.

=== Fixed broadband ===
Austria&#x27;s fixed broadband connectivity demonstrates both advancement and areas needing enhancement, according to the DESI 2022 report. The country achieves a fixed broadband take-up rate of 78% among households, aligning with the EU average. However, Austria falls short in adopting high-speed broadband (at least 100 Mbps), with an 18% take-up rate, significantly lower than the EU average of 41%. Coverage of Very High Capacity Networks (VHCN) and Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) in Austria, at 45% and 27% respectively, also trails behind the EU averages of 70% and 50%.

=== Mobile broadband ===
The country has demonstrated substantial advancements in mobile broadband connectivity, achieving a 91% take-up rate among individuals, which exceeds the EU average of 87%. Notably, the country has made progress in 5G deployment, providing coverage to 77% of populated areas, surpassing the EU average by 11 percentage points and aligning with its objective of achieving nationwide 5G coverage by 2025. Additionally, Austria has allocated 66% of the total harmonized 5G spectrum as of 2022, surpassing the EU average of 56%.

=== Digital public services ===
In the DESI 2022 report, Austria ranked 12th among EU countries in terms of digital public services, aligning closely with EU averages in the provision of digital public services for citizens and businesses, with take-up rates of 76 out of 100 and 81 out of 100, respectively. The country exhibited strong engagement in e-government services, with a usage rate of 79% among its internet users, surpassing the EU average of 65%. Additionally, Austria demonstrated proficiency in providing pre-filled forms and open data, scoring 71 out of 100 and 92%, respectively. These scores exceed the EU averages of 64 out of 100 for pre-filled forms and 81% for open data.

Under the &#x27;Digital Action Plan Austria&#x27;, the country has implemented strategic initiatives to improve digital interactions between the government and citizens. One such initiative is the &#x27;Business Service Portal&#x27;, developed to simplify public service procedures, which has been recently updated to enhance user experience and integrate AI for improved service delivery. The rollout of &#x27;ID Austria&#x27; represents an important step towards establishing a unified electronic identification system, aimed at succeeding the &#x27;Mobile Phone Signature&#x27; system and ensuring compatibility with the EU-wide e-IDAS regulation for cross-border authentication. Projects like the &#x27;Digital Office App&#x27; and the ELGA electronic health record system are part of efforts to make digital public services more accessible in Austria.

===Internet censorship and surveillance===
In August 2014, IFPI Austria has requested Internet blocking for several file sharing web sites such as The Pirate Bay and isoHunt, starting the latest August 14, 2014 (postponed from August 1, 2014). This procedure has been heavily criticized in the media, as there is no formal procedure for unblocking such IPs ever again, and no formal review process that incorrect blocks cannot be obtained. Users sharing an IP may be blocked as a side effect, too.

, Austrian ISPs are now once again free to unblock all previously blocked sites after the government appealed a new law for file sharing similar to the one in Switzerland. Although the IFPI is still trying to challenge this ruling.

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority. Individuals and groups engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail. Authorities work to restrict access to Web sites containing information that violates the law, such as neo-Nazi and child pornography sites. Authorities restrict access to banned Web sites by trying to shut such sites and forbidding the country&#x27;s Internet service providers to carry them.

The Austrian constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and the press. The independent media are active and express a wide variety of views with few restrictions. Individuals generally criticize the government publicly or privately without reprisal. The law prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions in practice.

The law prohibits incitement, insult, or contempt against a group because of its members’ race, nationality, or ethnicity if the statement violates human dignity and the government strictly enforces these laws. The law prohibits public denial, belittlement, approval, or justification of the Nazi genocide or other Nazi crimes against humanity in a print publication, a broadcast, or other media and the government strictly enforces these laws. Strict libel and slander laws discourage reporting of governmental abuse. For example, many observers believed that the ability and willingness of the police to sue for libel or slander discourages individuals from reporting abuse by police.

On 31 July 2012, a 26-year-old man received an 18-month sentence, of which 12 months were to be served, for posting that his favorite book was Hitler’s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and linking to Nazi material on his Facebook page.

In February 2007 Austrian authorities were able to uncover a &quot;child-pornography ring&quot; involving seventy-seven countries, based on a report by a man working for a Vienna-based Internet file-hosting service.

As of March 2022 the websites of RT have been blocked by the major Internet service providers.

In August 2022, ISPs were ordered to block further domains, as well as individual IP addresses belonging to CDN providers. The latter rendered a large number of websites to become unavailable.

==Telephones==

* International calling code: 43

===Fixed line phones===
* 3.4 million fixed line phones, 47th in the world (2011).

The majority of fixed lines are analogue, with Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) lines for the remainder.

Fixed-line subscribership has been in decline since the mid-1990s and was eclipsed by mobile-cellular in the late 1990s.

===Mobile phones===
* 7.6 million mobile phone lines in use, 60th in the world (2011).

The Austrian mobile phone market is highly competitive, with some of the lowest rates in Europe. Due to the geographical structures of Austria (mountains, flat lands, lakes) many providers use it as a &quot;testing range&quot; for new services. Mobile number portability was introduced in 2008, allowing users to retain their mobile phone numbers when switching between network operators. The original area codes allocated to each operator can no longer be used to determine the network with which a subscriber is registered.

;First generation networks
D-Netz by Telekom Austria. This network was switched off at the end of the 1990s.
;Second generation networks
There are three nationwide GSM networks which also support additional brands and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs).
* A1: originally Mobilkom. It now runs a mixed GSM-900, GSM-1800 and UMTS network. Also provides service for MVNO&#x27;s bob, B-free (owned by A1), Red Bull Mobile and Yess! 
* T-Mobile: originally max mobil. It now runs a mixed GSM-900, GSM-1800 and UMTS network. Also marketed as telering as a separate brand.
* Orange: originally One (until September 2008). A mixed GSM-1800 and UMTS network. Since end 2011 owned by Drei/Hutchinson Whampoa.

;Third generation networks
Drei: Owned by Hutchinson Whampoa, a Hong Kong based company that runs its own UMTS network.

==Radio and television==
* There are 2 AM, 160 FM and 1 shortwave radio broadcast stations, with several hundred FM repeaters. 
* There were 6.08 million radios in Austria in 1997. 
* There are 45 broadcast television stations, with in excess of 1000 repeaters. 
* There were 4.25 million televisions in the country in 1997.

The largest broadcasting corporations are:
* Österreichischer Rundfunk (ORF), Austria&#x27;s public broadcaster, was the main broadcast source until commercial radio and TV service was introduced in the 1990s. 
* ATV, privately held
* Puls 4, privately held
* Servus TV, privately held

<doc id="68915" wikidata="Q35883" url="?curid=68915" title="Aral Sea">
<text>The Aral Sea () was an endorheic lake lying between Kazakhstan to its north and Uzbekistan to its south, which began shrinking in the 1960s and had largely dried up by the 2010s. It was in the Aktobe and Kyzylorda regions of Kazakhstan and the Karakalpakstan autonomous region of Uzbekistan. The name roughly translates from Mongolic and Turkic languages to &quot;Sea of Islands&quot;, a reference to the large number of islands (over 1,100) that once dotted its waters. The Aral Sea drainage basin encompasses Uzbekistan and parts of Afghanistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.

Formerly the third-largest lake in the world with an area of , the Aral Sea began shrinking in the 1960s after the rivers that fed it were diverted by Soviet irrigation projects. By 2007, it had declined to 10% of its original size, splitting into four lakes: the North Aral Sea, the eastern and western basins of the once far larger South Aral Sea, and the smaller intermediate Barsakelmes Lake. By 2009, the southeastern lake had disappeared and the southwestern lake had retreated to a thin strip at the western edge of the former southern sea. In subsequent years occasional water flows have led to the southeastern lake sometimes being replenished to a small degree. Satellite images by NASA in August 2014 revealed that for the first time in modern history the eastern basin of the Aral Sea had completely dried up. The eastern basin is now called the Aralkum Desert.

In a Kazakhstani effort to save and replenish the North Aral Sea, the Dike Kokaral dam was completed in 2005. By 2008, the water level had risen above that of 2003, to . , salinity dropped, and fish were again present in sufficient numbers for some fishing to be viable.

After the visit to Muynak in 2011, former United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called the shrinking of the Aral Sea &quot;one of the planet&#x27;s worst environmental disasters&quot;. The region&#x27;s once-prosperous fishing industry has been devastated, bringing unemployment and economic hardship. The water from the diverted Syr Darya river is used to irrigate about of farmland in the Ferghana Valley. The Aral Sea region is heavily polluted, with consequent serious public health problems. UNESCO has added historical documents concerning the Aral Sea to its Memory of the World Register as a resource to study the environmental tragedy.

==Formation==
The Amu Darya river flowed into the Caspian Sea via the Uzboy Channel until the Holocene. Geographer Nick Middleton believes it did not begin to flow into the Aral Sea until that time.

== Ecology ==

=== Native fish ===
Despite its former vast size, the Aral Sea had relatively low indigenous biodiversity. However, the Aral Sea basin had an exceptional array of endemic fish subspecies (including three endemic sturgeon species). Most of these still survive in the North Aral Sea, but some, such as the sturgeons, have been greatly reduced or even driven to extirpation by the lake&#x27;s shrinkage. Native fish species of the lake included ship sturgeon (&quot;Acipenser nudiventris&quot;), all three &quot;Pseudoscaphirhynchus&quot; sturgeon species, Aral trout (&quot;Salmo trutta aralensis&quot;), northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;), ide (&quot;Leuciscus idus oxianus&quot;), asp (&quot;Aspius aspius iblioides&quot;), common rudd (&quot;Scardinius erythropthalmus&quot;), Turkestan barbel (&quot;Luciobarbus capito conocephalus&quot;), Aral barbel (&quot;L. brachycephalus brachycephalus&quot;), common bream (&quot;Abramis brama orientalis&quot;), white-eyed bream (&quot;Ballerus sapa aralensis&quot;), Danube bleak (&quot;Chalcalburnus chalcoides aralensis&quot;), ziege (&quot;Pelecus cultratus&quot;), crucian carp (&quot;Carassius carassius gibelio&quot;), common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio aralensis&quot;), Wels catfish (&quot;Silurus glanis&quot;), Ukrainian stickleback (&quot;Pungitius platygaster aralensis&quot;), zander (&quot;Sander lucioperca&quot;), European perch (&quot;Perca fluviatilis&quot;), and Eurasian ruffe (&quot;Gymnocephalus cernuus&quot;). All these fish aside from the stickleback lived an or semi-anadromous lifestyle.

The salinity increase and drying of the lake led to the local extinction of the Aral trout, ruffe, Turkestan barbel, and all sturgeon species, and dams now block their return and migration routes; the Aral trout and Syr Darya sturgeon (&quot;Pseudoscaphirhynchus fedtschenkoi&quot;) may be extinct due to their restricted range. All other native fish, barring the stickleback (which persisted during the lake&#x27;s shrinkage and salinity increase), were also extirpated, but many have returned to the North Aral Sea following its recovery from the 1990s onwards.

=== Introduced fish ===

Other salt-tolerant fish species were intentionally or inadvertently introduced during the 1960s when hydropower and irrigation projects reduced the flow of fresh water thereby increasing salinity. These include the Baltic herring (&quot;Clupea harengus membras&quot;), big-scale sand smelt (&quot;Atherina boyeri caspia&quot;), black-striped pipefish (&quot;Syngnatus abaster caspius&quot;), Caucasian dwarf goby (&quot;Knipowitschia caucasica&quot;), monkey goby (&quot;Neogobius fluviatilis&quot;), round goby (&quot;N. melanostomus&quot;), Syrman goby (&quot;N. syrman&quot;), bighead goby (&quot;Ponticola kessleri&quot;), tubenose goby (&quot;Proterorchinus marmoratus&quot;), grass carp (&quot;Ctenopharyngodon idella&quot;), silver carp (&quot;Hypophtalmichthys molitrix&quot;), bighead carp (&quot;H. nobilis&quot;), black carp (&quot;Mylopharyngodon piceus&quot;), and northern snakehead (&quot;Channa argus warpachowski&quot;).

The herring, sand smelt, and gobies were the first planktivorous fish in the lake, leading to a collapse of the lake&#x27;s zooplankton population. This in turn caused a collapse of the herring and sand smelt population from which neither species has recovered. All introduced species aside from the carp, snakehead, and (possibly) pipefish survived the lake&#x27;s shrinkage and salinity increase, and during this time the European flounder (&quot;Platichthys flesus&quot;) was introduced to revive fisheries. The extirpated species (aside from possibly the pipefish) returned to the North Aral Sea following its recovery. Herring, sand smelt, gobies and flounder persisted in the South Aral Sea until increasing salinity extirpated all but the gobies.

=== Invertebrates ===
Prior to its shrinkage, the Aral Sea had about 250 species of native aquatic invertebrates, the majority (about 80%) being freshwater species; the rest were marine invertebrates with ties to the Ponto-Caspian and Mediterranean-Atlantic fauna. The dominant species (excluding protozoa) were rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods. Advanced crustaceans (Malacostraca) were represented by a single amphipod species, &quot;Dikerogammarus aralensis&quot;, an endemic of the Syr Darya basin. There were several native bivalves in the Aral Sea, including members of the genera &quot;Dreissena&quot; (including an endemic subspecies of zebra mussel, &quot;Dreissena polymorpha aralensis&quot;), &quot;Hypanis&quot;, and the lagoon cockle (&quot;Cerastoderma glaucum&quot;) (formerly considered distinct species &quot;Cerastoderma rhomboides&quot; and &quot;C. isthmica&quot;). Native gastropods included &quot;Theodoxus pallasi&quot; and a member of &quot;Caspiohydrobia&quot;.

Many of these invertebrates had their numbers drastically reduced due to the introduced fish species. Later, during an unsuccessful attempt to introduce mullet (&quot;Mugil&quot; sp.) to the Aral from the Caspian Sea, the rockpool shrimp (&quot;Palaemon elegans&quot;) was inadvertently introduced to the sea. The shrimp is thought to be responsible for the extirpation of the near-endemic amphipod &quot;Dikerogammarus aralensis&quot;, which now survives only in the Syr Darya basin. The copepod &quot;Calanipeda aquaedulcis&quot; was introduced to the Aral to replace the zooplankton species reduced by the herring population, and the North American mud crab &quot;Rhithropanopeus harrisii&quot; was inadvertently introduced during this attempt as well.

Later, as the lake&#x27;s salinity increased, many of the freshwater-adapted species disappeared, only leaving behind the marine and saline species. However, the zooplankton population in the North Aral Sea has recovered as salinity has decreased from the 1990s onwards, with extirpated crustacean and rotifer species returning naturally via the Syr Darya River, at the expense of the saltwater species. The cladoceran &quot;Moina mongolica&quot;, extirpated by the introduced fish species, has also returned. The zebra mussel (&quot;Dreissena polymorpha aralensis&quot;) has been reintroduced. In contrast, in the South Aral Sea only a few nematodes, rotifers, and parthenogenic brine shrimp (&quot;Artemia parthenogenetica&quot;) exist. The future prospects for aquatic invertebrates in all remaining Aral Sea fragments depend on their future changes in salinity.

==History==

Climate shifts have driven multiple phases of sea-level rise and fall. Inflow rates from the Amu Darya and Syr Darya are affected by glacial melt rates at the rivers&#x27; headwaters as well as precipitation within the river basins; cold, dry climates restrict both processes. Geologically driven shifts in the course of the Amu Darya between the Aral Sea and the Sarykamysh basins and anthropogenic water withdrawal from Amu Darya and Syr Darya have caused fluctuations in the Aral Sea&#x27;s water level. Artificial irrigation systems began in ancient times and continue to the present. According to Sergey Tolstov&#x27;s theory, once Amu Darya was connected to Caspian sea, but this connection was broken by people 2500 years ago to feed the Aral Sea and irrigation system in Khorezm, more princely in Khiva and other cities in this region. 

The Aral Sea was part of the western frontier of the Chinese Empire during the Tang dynasty.

During Mongol Invasion, Mongols destroyed the cities and waterworks, which led to changes in Amu Darya&#x27;s route, or some of its branches, and refilling the Lake Sarykamysh, that connected Caspian Sea again. Aral Sea region was divided between three Mongol Hordes: the Jochi or Golden Horde, the Ilkhanids, and the Chagatai.

Muslim geographers, such as Hafiz-i Abru, wrote about the disappearance of the Aral Sea in 1417 due to diversions in both the Amu Darya and Syr Darya.

The Russian expedition of Alexey Butakov performed the first observations of the Aral Sea in 1848. The first steamer arrived in the Aral Sea three years later. The Aral Sea fishing industry began with the Russian dealers Lapshin, Ritkin, Krasilnikov, and Makeev, which later formed major fishing unions.

===Naval===
Russian naval presence on the Aral Sea began in 1847 with the founding of Raimsk, soon renamed Fort Aralsk, near the mouth of the Syr Darya. As the Aral Sea basin is not connected to other bodies of water, the Imperial Russian Navy deployed its vessels by disassembling them in Orenburg on the Ural River and transporting them overland to be reassembled at Aralsk. The first two ships, assembled in 1847, were the two-masted schooners &quot;Nikolai&quot; and &quot;Mikhail&quot;. The former was a warship; the latter a merchant vessel to establish fisheries. They surveyed the northern part of the sea in 1848, the same year that a larger warship, the &quot;Constantine&quot;, was assembled. Commanded by Lt. Alexey Butakov (Алексей Бутаков), the &quot;Constantine&quot; completed the survey of the entire Aral Sea over the next two years. Exiled Ukrainian poet and painter Taras Shevchenko participated in the expedition and produced a number of sketches.

In 1851 two newly built steamers arrived from Sweden. The geological surveys had found no coal deposits in the area so the Military Governor-General of Orenburg Vasily Perovsky ordered an &quot;as large as possible supply&quot; of saxaul (&quot;Haloxylon ammodendron&quot;, a desert shrub akin to the creosote bush) to be collected in Aralsk for the new steamers. Saxaul wood proved not to be a suitable fuel and in the later years the Aral Flotilla was provisioned, at substantial cost, by coal from the Donbas.

===Irrigation canals===

In the early 1960s, as part of the Soviet government plan for cotton, or &quot;white gold&quot;, to become a major export, the Amu Darya river in the south and the Syr Darya river in the east were diverted from feeding the Aral Sea to irrigate the desert in an attempt to grow cotton, melons, rice and cereals. This plan was initially successful, and by 1988, Uzbekistan was the world&#x27;s largest exporter of cotton. However to achieve these results farms relied heavily on agro-chemicals, including dioxin, which was used even after banning. Farmers, including children, were intoxicated by these chemicals. Due to abuse, the soil crucially degraded. Though production levels declined from its peak, cotton remains Uzbekistan&#x27;s main cash crop, accounting for 17% of the country&#x27;s exports in 2006.

Large scale construction of irrigation canals first began in the 1930s and was greatly increased in the 1960s. Many canals were poorly built, allowing leakage and evaporation. Between 30 and 75% of the water from the Qaraqum Canal, the largest in Central Asia, went to waste. It was estimated in 2012 that only 12% of Uzbekistan&#x27;s irrigation canal length was waterproofed. Only 28% of interfarm irrigation channels, and 21% of onfarm channels have anti-infiltration linings, which retain on average 15% more water than unlined channels. Only 77% of farm intakes have flow gauges.

By 1960, between of water each year was going to the land instead of the Aral Sea and the sea began to recede. From 1961 to 1970, the Aral&#x27;s level fell an average of per year. In the 1970s the rate nearly tripled to per annum, and in the 1980s to per annum. The amount of water taken for irrigation from the rivers doubled between 1960 and 2000. In the first half of the 20th century prior to the irrigation, the sea&#x27;s water level above sea level held steady at 53 m. By 2010, the large Aral was 27 m and the small Aral 43 m above sea level.

The disappearance of the lake was no surprise to the Soviets, they expected it to happen long before. As early as 1964, Aleksandr Asarin at the Hydroproject Institute pointed out that the lake was doomed, explaining, &quot;It was part of the five-year plans, approved by the council of ministers and the Politburo. Nobody on a lower level would dare to say a word contradicting those plans, even if it was the fate of the Aral Sea.&quot;

The reaction to the predictions varied. Some Soviet experts apparently considered the Aral to be &quot;nature&#x27;s error&quot;, and a Soviet engineer said in 1968, &quot;it is obvious to everyone that the evaporation of the Aral Sea is inevitable.&quot; On the other hand, starting in the 1960s, a large-scale project was proposed to redirect part of the flow of the rivers of the Ob basin to Central Asia over a gigantic canal system. Refilling of the Aral Sea was considered one of the project&#x27;s main goals. However, due to its staggering costs and the negative public opinion in Russia proper, the federal authorities had abandoned the project by 1986.

From 1960 to 1998, the sea&#x27;s surface area shrank by 60%, and its volume by 80%. In 1960, the Aral Sea had been the world&#x27;s fourth-largest lake with an area of and a volume of . By 1998, it had dropped to and eighth largest. Its salinity increased; having originally been 10 g/L, by 1990 it was at 376 g/L. (By comparison, seawater is typically 35 g/L, and the Dead Sea between 300 and 350 g/L.)

In 1987, the lake split into two separate bodies of water: the North Aral Sea (the Lesser Sea, or Small Aral Sea) and the South Aral Sea (the Greater Sea, or Large Aral Sea). In June 1991, Uzbekistan gained independence from the Soviet Union. Craig Murray, UK ambassador to Uzbekistan in 2002, attributes the shrinkage of the Aral Sea in the 1990s to president Islam Karimov&#x27;s cotton policy. The enormous irrigation system was massively wasteful, crop rotation was not used, and huge quantities of pesticides and fertilizer were applied. The runoff from the fields washed these chemicals into the shrinking sea, creating severe pollution and health problems. As demand for cotton increased, the government applied more pesticides and fertilizer to the monocultured and depleted soil. Forced labor was used and profits were siphoned off by the powerful and well-connected.

In 2003, the South Aral further divided into eastern and western basins. The waters in the deepest parts of the sea were saltier and didn&#x27;t mix with the top waters, so only the top of the sea was heated in the summer, resulting in faster evaporation than had been predicted. A plan was announced for the recovery of the North Aral Sea by building Dike Kokaral, a concrete dam separating the two halves of the Aral Sea.

In 2004, the sea&#x27;s surface area was , 25% of its original size, and a nearly fivefold increase in salinity had killed most of its flora and fauna. Dike Kokaral was completed in 2005 and, as of 2006, some recovery of sea level had been recorded.

== Impact on environment, economy, and public health ==
The Aral Sea is considered an example of ecosystem collapse. The ecosystems of the Aral Sea and the river deltas feeding into it have been nearly destroyed, largely because of the salinity being dramatically higher than ocean water. The receding sea has left huge plains covered with salt and toxic chemicals from weapons testing, industrial projects, and runoff of pesticides and fertilizer. Because of the shrinking water source and worsening water and soil quality, pesticides were increasingly used from the 1960s to raise cotton yield, which further polluted the water with toxins (e.g. HCH, TCCD, DDT). Industrial pollution also resulted in PCB and heavy-metal contamination.

Owing to the insufficiency of water left in the Aral sea, concentrations of these pollutants rose drastically both in the remaining water and in the dry beds. This resulted in wind-borne toxic dust that spread quite widely. People living in the lower parts of the river basins and former shore zones ingested pollutants through drinking local water and inhaling contaminated dust. Furthermore, due to absorption by plants and livestock, toxins — many of which bioaccumulate and are not easily broken down or excreted by the liver and kidneys — entered the food chain. Inhabitants of the surrounding areas commonly experience a shortage of fresh water, and health problems are widespread — including high rates of certain cancers, respiratory illnesses including tuberculosis (mostly drug resistant), digestive disorders, anaemia, and infectious diseases. Liver, kidney, and eye problems may also be due to the toxic dust storms. Together, this presented an unusually high fatality rate among vulnerable age groups: child mortality stood at 75 per 1,000 in 2009, while maternal mortality was 12 in every 1,000.

The dust storms have also contributed to water shortages through salt deposition. Overusing pesticides on crops to preserve yields has exacerbated this. Crops are destroyed where salt is deposited by the wind. The most heavily affected fields must be flushed with water four times per day to remove salt and toxic matter. A 1998 study indicated that few crops (besides fodder) tolerate the degradation, restricting what Kazakhstan farmers now choose to seed.

Inland seas and lakes generally moderate a region&#x27;s climate through humidification, regulation of thermal energy, and peri-winter albedo effects. Loss of water in the Aral Sea has changed surface temperatures and wind patterns. This has led to a broader annual temperature range (about a 4 to 12 °C broadening) and more dust in storms locally and regionally.

===Biology===
The Aral Sea fishing industry, which at its peak employed some 40,000 and reportedly produced one-sixth of the Soviet Union&#x27;s entire fish catch, has been devastated. In the 1980s commercial harvests were becoming unsustainable, and by 1987 commercial harvest became nonexistent. Due to the declining sea levels, salinity levels became too high for the 20 native fish species to survive. The only fish that could survive the high-salinity levels was flounder. Also, as water has receded, former fishing towns along the original shores have become ship graveyards.

Aral, originally the main fishing port, is now about 15 kilometres from the sea and has seen its population decline dramatically since the beginning of the crisis. The town of Moynaq in Uzbekistan had a thriving harbour and fishing industry that employed about 30,000 people; now it lies 30–90 kilometres from the shore. Fishing boats lie scattered on the dry dusty land that was once covered by water; many have been there for 20 years.

The South Aral Sea remains too saline to host any species other than halotolerant organisms. The South Aral has been incapable of supporting fish since the late 1990s, when the flounder were killed by rising salinity levels.

Also destroyed is the muskrat-trapping industry in the deltas of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, which used to yield as many as 500,000 pelts a year.

===Vulnerable populations===
Local inhabitants are the most vulnerable population in this environmental health crisis due to the highly polluted and salinated water used for drinking and the dried seabed. Toxic chemicals associated with pesticide use have been found in blood and breast milk of mothers; specifically organochlorides, polychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PCBs), DDT compounds, and TCDD. These toxins can be, and often are, passed on to the children of these mothers, resulting in low birthweight and congenital abnormalities. The rate of infants being born with abnormalities is five times higher in this region than in European countries. The Aral Sea region has 26% of its children born at low birthweight, which is two standard deviations away from a national population study gathered by the WHO.

Exposures to toxic chemicals from the dry seabed and polluted water have caused other health issues in women and children. Renal tubular dysfunction has become a large health concern in children in the Aral Sea region as it is showing extremely high prevalence rates. Renal tubular dysfunction can also be related to growth and developmental stunting. This, in conjunction with the already high rate of low-birthweight children and children born with abnormalities, contributes to severe negative health effects and outcomes for children. These issues are compounded by the lack of research on maternal and child health effects caused by the demise of the Aral Sea. For example, only 26 English-language peer-reviewed articles and four reports on children&#x27;s health were produced between 1994 and 2008. In addition, there is a lack of health infrastructure and resources in the Aral Sea region to combat the health issues that have arisen.

There is a lack of medication and equipment in many medical facilities, so health professionals do not have access to the necessary supplies to do their jobs in the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan regions. There is also meager development of a health information system that would allow for extensive research or surveillance of emerging health issues due to Aral Sea issues. An absence of a primary care approach in the health systems of this region also hinders services and access that could prevent and treat issues stemming from the Aral Sea crisis, especially in women and children.

The impoverished are also particularly vulnerable to the environmental and health related effects of changes to the Aral Sea. These populations were most likely to reside downstream from the Basin and in former coastal communities. They were also among the first to be detrimentally affected, representing at least 4.4 million people in the region. Considered to have the worst health in this region, their plight was not helped when their fishery livelihoods vanished with the decreasing levels of water and loss of many aquatic species. Thus, those in poverty are entrenched in a vicious cycle.

==Solutions==
===Proposed environmental solutions===
Many different solutions to the problems have been suggested over the years, varying in feasibility and cost, including:
*Improving the quality of irrigation canals
*Using alternative cotton species that require less water
*Promoting non-agricultural economic development in upstream countries
*Using fewer chemicals on the cotton
*Cultivating crops other than cotton
*Redirecting water from the Volga, Ob and Irtysh rivers to restore the Aral Sea to its former size in 20–30 years at a cost of US$30–50 billion
*Pumping sea water into the Aral Sea from the Caspian Sea via a pipeline, and diluting it with fresh water from local catchment areas
In January 1994, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan signed a deal to pledge 1% of their budgets to help the sea recover.

In March 2000, UNESCO presented their &quot;Water-related vision for the Aral Sea basin for the year 2025&quot;.

By 2006, the World Bank&#x27;s restoration projects, especially in the North Aral, were giving rise to some unexpected, tentative relief in what had been an extremely pessimistic picture.

===Restoration strategies===
====Technology====
Funded in part by the United Nations Development Programme, implementations in Kazakhstan such as laser levelling and irrigation optimization using energy-efficient technologies has shown effectiveness.

===Aral Sea Basin Programme - 1===
The future of the Aral Sea and the responsibility for its survival are now in the hands of the five countries: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan. In 1994, they adopted the Aral Sea Basin Programme or ASBP. The Programme&#x27;s four objectives are:
*To stabilize the environment of the Aral Sea Basin
*To rehabilitate the disaster area around the sea
*To improve the management of the international waters of the Aral Sea Basin
*To build the capacity of institutions at the regional and national level to advance the programme&#x27;s aims

====ASBP: Phase One====
The first phase of the plan effectively began with the first involvement from the World Bank in 1992, and was in operation until 1997. It was ineffectual for a number of reasons, but mainly because it was focused on improving directly the land around the Aral Sea, whilst not intervening in the water usage upstream. There was considerable concern amongst the Central Asian governments, which realised the importance of the Aral Sea in the ecosystem and the economy of Central Asia, and they were prepared to cooperate, but they found it difficult to implement the procedures of the plan. 

This is due in part to a lack of co-operation among the affected people. The water flowing into the Aral Sea has long been considered an important commodity, and trade agreements have been made to supply the downstream communities with water in the spring and summer months for irrigation. In return, they supply the upstream countries with fuel during the winter, instead of storing water during the warm months for hydroelectric purposes in winter. However, very few legal obligations are binding these contracts, particularly on an international stage. 

====ASBP: Phase Two====
Phase Two of the Aral Sea Basin programme followed in 1998 and ran for five years. The main shortcomings of phase two were due to its lack of integration with the local communities involved. The scheme was drawn up by the World Bank, government representatives, and various technical experts, without consulting those who would be affected. An example of this was the public awareness initiatives, which were seen as propagandist attempts by people with little care or understanding of their situation. These failures have led to the introduction of a new plan, funded by a number of institutions, including the five countries involved and the World Bank.

====ASBP: Phase Three====
In 1997, a new plan was conceived which would continue with the previous restoration efforts of the Aral Sea. The main aims of this phase are to improve the irrigation systems currently in place, whilst targeting water management at a local level. The largest project in this phase is the North Aral Sea Project, a direct effort to recover the northern region of the Aral Sea. The North Aral Sea Project&#x27;s main initiative is the construction of a dam across the Berg Strait, a deep channel which connects the North Aral Sea to the South Aral Sea. The Kok-Aral Dam is long and has capacity for over 29 cubic kilometres of water to be stored in the North Aral Sea, whilst allowing excess to overflow into the South Aral Sea.

===Aral Sea Basin Programme – 2===
On 6 October 2002, the Heads of States met again to revise the ASBP program. ASBP-2 was in place from 2003 to 2010. The main purpose of the ASBP-2 was to set up projects that covered a vast amount of environmental, socioeconomic and water management issues. The ASBP-2 was financed by organization such as the UNDP, World Bank, USAID, Asian Development Bank, and the governments of Switzerland, Japan, Finland, Norway and others. Over 2 billion US Dollars was provided by the IFAS country members to the program.

===Aral Sea Basin Programme – 3===
On 28 April 2009, the Head of States came together with the Interstate commission for Water Coordination, Interstate Commission for Sustainable Development and National Experts and donors to develop the ASBP-3. This Program was in effect from 2011- 2015. The main purpose of the ASBP-3 was to improve the environmental and socio-economic situation of the Aral Sea Basin. The four program priorities were:
*Direction one: Integrated Use of Water Resources 
*Direction two: Environmental protection 
*Direction three: Socio-economic Development 
*Direction four: Improving the institutional and legal instruments

====ASBP-3: Direction One====
Direction One&#x27;s main purpose is to propose program that focus on addressing transboundary water resources management, establishment of monitoring systems and addressing safety concerns in water facilities. Examples of programs that have been proposed include:
*&quot;Developing proposals to optimize the management and use of water resources in Central Asia, taking into account environmental factors, effects of climate change to meet the national interests of the Aral Sea basin.&quot;
*&quot;Improving the quality of hydrometeorological services for weather-dependent sectors of the economy of Central Asia.&quot;
*&quot;Creating a database and computer models for the management of transboundary water resources.&quot;
*&quot;Assisting the countries in reducing the risk of natural disasters, including through the strengthening of regional cooperation, improve disaster preparedness and response.&quot;

====ASBP-3: Direction Two====
Directions two&#x27;s main focus is on addressing the issues related to environmental protection and improvement of the environment. Areas of interest include:
*&quot;The environment in the deltas of the Syr Darya and Amu Darya improved.&quot;
*&quot;Mountain environments improved.&quot;
*&quot;The environment and productivity of pastures improved.&quot;
*&quot;A regional information system on the environment established.&quot;

====ASBP-3: Direction Three====
Direction three looks to address socio-economic issues by focusing on education and public health, improving unemployment rates, improving water systems, increasing sustainable development and improving living conditions. The expected outputs are:
*&quot;An improved access to safe drinking water.&quot;
*&quot;For the rural population: establishment and/or development of private small enterprises, creation of new jobs, and increased labor efficiency.&quot;
*&quot;An improvement in the quality of medical services&quot;
*&quot;An improvement in the effectiveness and quality of education in schools and pre-school facilities in rural areas.&quot;

====ASBP-3: Direction Four====
Direction Four aims to address issues related to institutional development and the development of policies and strategies that relate to sustainable development and public awareness. Expected outputs include:
*&quot;Conditions for a transparent and mutually beneficial regional dialogue and cooperation, including setting up a sectorial dialogue between governments established.&quot;
*&quot;A Prototype of the single information and analysis system for the water sector established.&quot;
*&quot;A Communication Strategy for stakeholders and the public established.&quot; 
*&quot;Training systems for the water sector and the hydrometeorological services in Central Asia improved.&quot;

===North Aral Sea restoration work===

Work is being done to restore in part the North Aral Sea. Irrigation works on the Syr Darya have been repaired and improved to increase its water flow, and in October 2003, the Kazakh government announced a plan to build Dike Kokaral, a concrete dam separating the two halves of the Aral Sea. Work on this dam was completed in August 2005; since then, the water level of the North Aral has risen, and its salinity has decreased. , some recovery of sea level has been recorded, sooner than expected. &quot;The dam has caused the small Aral&#x27;s sea level to rise swiftly to 38 m (125 ft), from a low of less than 30 m (98 ft), with 42 m (138 ft) considered the level of viability.&quot;

Economically significant stocks of fish have returned, and observers who had written off the North Aral Sea as an environmental disaster were surprised by unexpected reports that, in 2006, its returning waters were already partly reviving the fishing industry and producing catches for export as far as Ukraine. The improvements to the fishing industry were largely due to the drop in the average salinity of the sea from 30 grams to 8 grams per liter; this drop in salinity prompted the return of almost 24 freshwater species. The restoration also reportedly gave rise to long-absent rain clouds and possible microclimate changes, bringing tentative hope to an agricultural sector swallowed by a regional dustbowl, and some expansion of the shrunken sea.

The sea, which had receded almost south of the port-city of Aralsk, is now a mere away. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry stated that &quot;The North Aral Sea&#x27;s surface increased from in 2003 to in 2008. The sea&#x27;s depth increased from 30 meters (98 ft) in 2003 to 42 meters (138 ft) in 2008.&quot; Now, a second dam is to be built based on a World Bank loan to Kazakhstan, with the start of construction initially slated for 2009 and postponed to 2011, to further expand the shrunken Northern Aral, eventually reducing the distance to Aralsk to only . Then, it was planned to build a canal spanning the last 6 km, to reconnect the withered former port of Aralsk to the sea.

On 15 June 2021 the Central Communications Service of Kazakhstan announced that they plan to plant saxaul trees on one million hectares of the drained bottom of the Aral Sea as part of efforts to stop dust storms on the region. Other efforts include expanding the sea&#x27;s water mirror.

===Future of South Aral Sea===

The South Aral Sea, half of which lies in Uzbekistan, was abandoned to its fate. Most of Uzbekistan&#x27;s part of the Aral Sea is completely shriveled up. Only excess water from the North Aral Sea is periodically allowed to flow into the largely dried-up South Aral Sea through a sluice in the dike. Discussions had been held on recreating a channel between the somewhat improved North and the desiccated South, along with uncertain wetland restoration plans throughout the region, but political will is lacking. Unlike Kazakhstan, which has partially revived its part of the Aral Sea, Uzbekistan shows no signs of abandoning the Amu Darya river to irrigate their cotton, and is moving toward oil exploration in the drying South Aral seabed.

Attempts to mitigate the effects of desertification include planting vegetation in the newly exposed seabed; however, intermittent flooding of the eastern basin is likely to prove problematic for any development. Redirecting what little flow there is from the Amu Darya to the western basin may salvage fisheries there while relieving the flooding of the eastern basin. The reforestation is focused on plants adapted to desert conditions such as &quot;Haloxylon ammodendron&quot;, &quot;Ephedra strobilacea&quot;, &quot;Salsola&quot; species, and &quot;Tamarix&quot; species. The eventual aim is to plant up to of forest in the Uzbekistan portion. The forest is intended to slow desertification and reduce the impact of sandstorms on nearby communities.

==Institutional bodies==
The Interstate Commission for Water Coordination of Central Asia (ICWC) was formed on 18 February 1992 to formally unite Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in the hopes of solving environmental, as well as socioeconomic problems in the Aral Sea region. The River Basin Organizations (the BVOs) of the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers were institutions called upon by the ICWC to help manage water resources. According to the ICWC, the main objectives of the body are:
* River basin management
* Water allocation without conflict
* Organization of water conservation on transboundary water courses
* Interaction with hydrometeorological services of the countries on flow forecast and account
* Introduction of automation into head structures
* Regular work on ICWC and its bodies&#x27; activity advancement
* Interstate agreements preparation
* International relations
* Scientific research
* Training

The was developed on 23 March 1993, by the ICWC to raise funds for the projects under Aral Sea Basin programmes. The IFAS was meant to finance programmes to save the sea and improve on environmental issues associated with the basin&#x27;s drying. This programme has had some success with joint summits of the countries involved and finding funding from the World Bank to implement projects; however, it faces many challenges, such as enforcement and slowing progress.

==Vozrozhdeniya Island==

Vozrozhdeniya (Russian for &quot;rebirth&quot;) Island is a former island of the Aral Sea or South Aral Sea. Due to the ongoing shrinkage of the Aral, it became first a peninsula in mid-2001 and finally part of the mainland. Other islands like Kokaral and Barsa-Kelmes shared a similar fate. Since the disappearance of the Southeast Aral in 2008, Vozrozhdeniya Island effectively no longer exists as a distinct geographical feature. The area is now shared by Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

In 1948, a top-secret Soviet bioweapons laboratory was established on the island, in the centre of the Aral Sea which is now disputed territory between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The exact history, functions and current status of this facility are still unclear, but bio-agents tested there included &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot;, &quot;Francisella tularensis&quot;, &quot;Brucella suis&quot;, &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot;, &quot;Variola major&quot; (smallpox), &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, botulinum toxin, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus.

In 1971, weaponized smallpox from the island reached a nearby ship, which then allowed the virus to spread to the city of Aral. Ten people there were infected, of whom three died, and a massive vaccination effort involving 50,000 inhabitants ensued (see Aral smallpox incident). The bioweapons base was abandoned in 1992 following the disintegration of the Soviet Union the previous year. Scientific expeditions proved this had been a site for production, testing and later dumping of pathogenic weapons. In 2002, through a project organized by the United States and with Uzbekistan&#x27;s assistance, 10 anthrax burial sites were decontaminated. According to the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic Infections, all burial sites of anthrax were decontaminated.

==Oil and gas exploration==
Ergash Shaismatov, the deputy prime minister of Uzbekistan, announced on 30 August 2006, that the Uzbek government and an international consortium consisting of state-run Uzbekneftegaz, LUKoil Overseas, Petronas, Korea National Oil Corporation, and China National Petroleum Corporation signed a production-sharing agreement to explore and develop oil and gas fields in the Aral Sea, saying, &quot;The Aral Sea is largely unknown, but it holds a lot of promise in terms of finding oil and gas. There is risk, of course, but we believe in the success of this unique project.&quot; The consortium was created in September 2005.

As of 1 June 2010, 500,000 cubic meters of gas had been extracted, from 3 km down.

==Films==
The plight of the Aral coast was portrayed in the 1989 film &quot;Stray Dogs&quot; by Soviet director Dmitri Svetozarov. The film was shot on location in an actual ghost town located near the Aral Sea, showing scenes of abandoned buildings and scattered vessels.

In 2000, the MirrorMundo foundation produced a documentary film called &quot;Delta Blues&quot; about the problems arising from the drying up of the sea.

In June 2007, BBC World broadcast a documentary called &quot;Back from the Brink?&quot; made by Borna Alikhani and Guy Creasey, which showed some of the changes in the region since the introduction of the Aklak Dam.

Bakhtyar Khudojnazarov&#x27;s 2012 movie &quot;Waiting for the Sea&quot; deals with the impacts on people&#x27;s life in a fishing town at the shore of the Aral Sea.

In 2012 Christoph Pasour and Alfred Diebold produced an 85-minute film with the title which shows the water management system in the Aral Sea basin and in particular the situation around the Aral Sea. The film was first screened at the 6th World Water Forum in Marseille, France, in 2012 and was available on the website waterunites-ca.org and on Alfred Diebold&#x27;s YouTube channel &quot;waterunitesca&quot;.

In October 2013, Al Jazeera produced a documentary film called &quot;People of the Lake&quot;, directed by Ensar Altay, describing the current situation.

In 2014, director Po Powell shot much of the footage for the Pink Floyd single &quot;Louder than Words&quot; video near the remains of the Aral Sea on the border between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

In October 2018, the BBC produced a programme called &quot;Fashion&#x27;s Dirty Secrets&quot;, a large part of which shows the extent of the shrinking Aral and its consequences.

In 2024, Daniel Asadi Faezi and Mila Zhluktenko directed a short film titled &quot;Aralkum&quot;, which explores the transformation of the Aral Sea into a desert. Published on the Emergence Magazine website, the film portrays the haunting landscape of the Aralkum Desert, which emerged after the Soviet Union diverted the Aral Sea&#x27;s tributaries for agricultural irrigation. It highlights the environmental consequences of the sea&#x27;s depletion, such as the desolate ecosystem and the struggles of the remaining inhabitants along the former shoreline.

<text>Telecommunications in the Bahamas is accomplished through the transmission of information by various types of technologies within The Bahamas, mainly telephones, radio, television, and the Internet.

==Status==


==Internet censorship and surveillance==

Access to the Internet is unrestricted. There were no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without judicial oversight.

The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. An independent press combined with a relatively effective—albeit extremely backlogged—judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system ensures freedom of speech and press. The constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions in practice. Strict and antiquated libel laws dating to British legal codes are seldom invoked.

In April 2013, the Bahamas Commissioner of Police Ellison Greenslade warned that the police would press charges against people who post “lewd” or “obscene” pictures on social media websites and Attorney General Allyson Maynard-Gibson announced that the government was working on legislation that will police information posted on the Internet. &quot;We have to balance freedom of the press with protecting the public,” she added. Also in April Rodney Moncur was charged with &quot;committing a grossly indecent act&quot; by posting autopsy photographs of a man who died in police custody on his Facebook page.

Phone calls to the Bahamas are monitored by the U.S. National Security Agency&#x27;s MYSTIC program.

<text>Telecommunications in [[Bahrain]] are provided by the Bahrain Telecommunications Company, trading as Batelco, as well as other companies such as Zain and STC. 
Prior to 1981 telecommunications services were provided by two separate departments: national services were provided by the Bahrain Telephone Company and international services by Cable &amp; Wireless of the United Kingdom. These were combined in 1981 to form Batelco. Since then, other telecommunications companies have entered the market.

==History==
When Batelco was founded in 1981, Bahrain had 45,627 telephone lines in use. By 1982, the number reached 50,000. In 1985, the country&#x27;s first fibre optic cable was installed. Batelco was a monopoly in the telecommunications sector until 2003. By 1999, the company had around 100,000 mobile contracts.

In 2002, under pressure from international bodies, Bahrain implemented its telecommunications law which included the establishment of an independent Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA). In 2003, Batelco&#x27;s monopoly over the sector ended when the TRA awarded a licence to MTC Vodafone, which later re-branded itself as Zain. In January 2010, Viva Bahrain, which later re-branded into STC Bahrain (a subsidiary of STC) started operations in Bahrain.

==Telephonic services==
In 2006, there were 194,200 telephones main lines in Bahrain.

<doc id="68920" wikidata="Q4207124" url="?curid=68920" title="Trophimus">
<text>Trophimus (, &quot;Tróphimos&quot;) or Trophimus the Ephesian (, &quot;Tróphimos ho Ephésios&quot;) was a Christian who accompanied Paul during a part of his third missionary journey. He was with Paul in Jerusalem, and the Jews, supposing that the apostle had brought him into the temple, raised a tumult which resulted in Paul&#x27;s imprisonment. (See Herod&#x27;s Temple). In writing to Timothy, the apostle comments that he left Trophimus in Miletus due to illness. This must refer to some event not noticed in the Acts.

His feast is kept on 29 December.

==Background==
Trophimus and companion Tychicus are called &quot;Asianoi&quot;(Acts 20:4). He was from Edessa.

==Companion to Paul==
Trophimus was one of eight friends (Acts 20:4), who accompanied Paul at the close of his third missionary journey and traveled with him from Greece, through Macedonia, into Asia, and onward by sea until Jerusalem was reached. Trophimus completed the journey with Paul, for, in the passages Acts 21:29, he is mentioned as being with Paul in Jerusalem immediately on the close of this journey.

===Cause of Apostle Paul&#x27;s Arrest===

He was the cause of Paul being assaulted in the courts of the temple by the mob, and then of his being arrested and imprisoned by the Romans. The occasion of this outrage was that Paul had &quot;brought Greeks also into the temple, and...defiled this holy place&quot; (Acts 21:28).

===Left at Miletus===
Trophimus is also mentioned in 2 Timothy 4:20: &quot;Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.&quot; This shows that he was again — several years after the date indicated in the previous passages — traveling with Paul on one of the missionary journeys which the apostle undertook after being liberated from his first imprisonment in Rome.

==Unnamed brother==
It has been conjectured that Trophimus is to be identified with the person mentioned in 2 Corinthians 8:16-24. There, Paul speaks in the highest terms of one of his companions whom he sent with Titus but does not provide his name. Titus and this disciple were evidently, those to whose care Paul entrusted the carrying of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. The apostle says of this unnamed brother, not only that his praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches, but also that he was chosen by the churches to travel with him.

<text>Bangladesh is a densely populated, low-lying, mainly riverine country located in South Asia with a coastline of on the northern littoral of the Bay of Bengal. The delta plain of the Ganges (Padma), Brahmaputra (Jamuna), and Meghna Rivers and their tributaries occupy 79 percent of the country. Four uplifted blocks (including the Madhupur and Barind Tracts in the centre and northwest) occupy 9 percent and steep hill ranges up to approximately high occupy 12 percent in the southeast (the Chittagong Hill Tracts) and in the northeast. Straddling the Tropic of Cancer, Bangladesh has a tropical monsoon climate characterised by heavy seasonal rainfall, high temperatures, and high humidity. Natural disasters such as floods and cyclones accompanied by storm surges periodically affect the country. Most of the country is intensively farmed, with rice the main crop, grown in three seasons. Rapid urbanisation is taking place with associated industrial and commercial development. Exports of garments and shrimp plus remittances from Bangladeshis working abroad provide the country&#x27;s three main sources of foreign exchange income.

==Physical geography==

The physical geography of Bangladesh is varied and has an area characterised by two distinctive features: a broad deltaic plain subject to frequent flooding, and a small hilly region crossed by swiftly flowing rivers. The country has an area of (according to BBS 2020) or (according to CIA World Factbook 2021) and extends north to south and east to west. Bangladesh is bordered on the west, north, and east by a land frontier with India and, in the southeast, by a short land and water frontier of with Myanmar. On the south is a highly irregular deltaic coastline of about , fissured by many rivers and streams flowing into the Bay of Bengal. The territorial waters of Bangladesh extend , and the exclusive economic zone of the country is .

Roughly 80% of the landmass is made up of fertile alluvial lowland called the Bangladesh Plain. The plain is part of the larger Plain of Bengal, which is sometimes called the Lower Gangetic Plain. Although, altitudes up to above sea level occur in the northern part of the plain, most elevations are less than above sea level; elevations decrease in the coastal south, where the terrain is generally at sea level. With such low elevations and numerous rivers, water—and concomitant flooding—is a predominant physical feature. About of the total area of Bangladesh is covered with water, and larger areas are routinely flooded during the monsoon season.

The only exceptions to Bangladesh&#x27;s low elevations are the Chittagong Hills in the southeast, the Low Hills of Sylhet in the northeast, and highlands in the north and northwest. The Chittagong Hills constitute the only significant hill system in the country and, in effect, are the western fringe of the north–south mountain ranges of Myanmar and eastern India. The Chittagong Hills rise steeply to narrow ridgelines, generally no wider than , with altitudes from above sea level. Saka Haphong Mountain is the highest peak in Bangladesh with an elevation of , located in the south-eastern part of the hills. Fertile valleys lie between the hill lines, which generally run north–south. West of the Chittagong Hills is a broad plain, cut by rivers draining into the Bay of Bengal, that rises to a final chain of low coastal hills, mostly below , that attain a maximum elevation.

In Bangladesh forest cover is around 14% of the total land area, equivalent to 1,883,400 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 1,920,330 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 1,725,330 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 158,070 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 33% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership.

The country produces large quantities of quality timber, bamboo, and sugarcane. Bamboo grows in almost all areas, but high-quality timber grows mostly in the highland valleys. Rubber planting in the hilly regions of the country was undertaken in the 1980s, and rubber extraction had started by the end of the decade. A variety of wild animals are found in the forest areas, such as in the Sundarbans on the southwest coast, which is the home of the Royal Bengal tiger. The alluvial soils in the Bangladesh Plain are generally fertile and are enriched with heavy silt deposits carried downstream during the rainy season.

==Human geography==

Urbanisation is proceeding rapidly, and it is estimated that only 30% of the population entering the labour force in the future will be absorbed into agriculture, although many will likely find other kinds of work in rural areas. The areas around Dhaka and Comilla are the most densely settled. The Sundarbans, an area of coastal tropical jungle in the southwest and last wild home of the Bengal tiger, and the Chittagong Hill Tracts on the south-eastern border with Myanmar and India, are the least densely populated.

==Climate==

Bangladesh has a tropical monsoon climate characterized by wide seasonal variations in rainfall, high temperatures, and high humidity. Regional climatic differences in this flat country are minor, though some variations can be seen between the weather patterns of the northern and southern regions, as the piedmontal plains of the former have a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate. According to Bangladesh Meteorological Department, there are six seasons in Bangladesh depending on the temperature, rainfall and direction of wind: mild and cool winter from December to February, hot and sunny summer or pre-monsoon season from March to May, somewhat cooler and very wet monsoon season from June to September and pleasant, shorter and cooler autumn or post-monsoon season in October–November. In general, maximum summer temperatures range between . April is the hottest month in most parts of the country. January is the coolest month, when the average temperature for most of the country is during the day and around at night.

Winds are mostly from the north and northwest in the winter, blowing gently at in northern and central areas and near the coast. From March to May, violent thunderstorms, called northwesters by local English speakers, produce winds of up to . During the intense storms of the early summer and late monsoon season, southerly winds of more than cause waves to crest as high as in the Bay of Bengal, which brings disastrous flooding to coastal areas.
Heavy rainfall is characteristic of Bangladesh, causing it to flood every year. Except for the relatively dry western region of Rajshahi, where the annual rainfall is about , most parts of the country receive at least of rainfall per year. Because of its location just south of the foothills of the Himalayas, where monsoon winds turn west and northwest, the region of Sylhet in northeastern Bangladesh receives the greatest average precipitation. From 1977 to 1986, annual rainfall in that region ranged between per year. Average daily humidity ranged from March lows of between 55 and 81% to July highs of between 94 and 100%, based on readings taken at selected stations nationwide in 1986.

About 80% of Bangladesh&#x27;s rain falls during the monsoon season. The monsoons result from the contrasts between low and high air pressure areas that result from differential heating of land and water. During the hot months of April and May, hot air rises over the Indian subcontinent, creating low-pressure areas into which rush cooler, moisture-bearing winds from the Indian Ocean. This is the southwest monsoon, commencing in June and usually lasting through September. Dividing against the Indian landmass, the monsoon flows in two branches, one of which strikes western India. The other travels up the Bay of Bengal and over eastern India and Bangladesh, crossing the plain to the north and northeast before being turned to the west and northwest by the foothills of the Himalayas.

Natural calamities, such as floods, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and tidal bores—destructive waves or floods caused by flood tides rushing up estuaries—ravage the country, particularly the coastal belt, almost every year. Between 1947 and 1988, 13 severe cyclones hit Bangladesh, causing enormous loss of life and property. In May 1985, for example, a severe cyclonic storm packing winds and waves high swept into south-eastern and southern Bangladesh, killing more than 11,000 persons, damaging more than 94,000 houses, killing some 135,000 head of livestock, and damaging nearly of critically needed embankments.
Annual monsoon flooding results in the loss of human life, damage to property and communication systems, and a shortage of drinking water, which leads to the spread of disease. For example, in 1988, two-thirds of Bangladesh&#x27;s 64 districts experienced extensive flood damage in the wake of unusually heavy rains that flooded the river systems. Millions were left homeless and without potable water. Half of Dhaka, including the runway at the Shahjalal International Airport—an important transit point for disaster relief supplies—was flooded. About of crops were reported destroyed, and relief work was rendered even more challenging than usual because the flood made transportation exceedingly difficult. A tornado in April 1989 killed more than 600 people, possibly many more.

There are no precautions against cyclones and tidal bores except giving advance warning and providing safe public buildings where people may take shelter. Adequate infrastructure and air transport facilities that would ease the suffering of the affected people had not been established by the late 1980s. Efforts by the government under the Third Five-Year Plan (1985–90) were directed toward accurate and timely forecast capability through agrometeorology, marine meteorology, oceanography, hydrometeorology, and seismology. Necessary expert services, equipment, and training facilities were expected to be developed under the United Nations Development Programme.


Cold weather is unusual in Bangladesh. When temperatures decrease to or less, people without warm clothing and living in inadequate homes may die from the cold.

==River systems==
The rivers of Bangladesh mark both the physiography of the nation and the life of the people. About 700 in number, these rivers generally flow south. The larger rivers serve as the main source of water for cultivation and as the principal arteries of commercial transportation. Rivers also provide fish, an important source of protein. Flooding of the rivers during the monsoon season causes enormous hardship and hinders development, but fresh deposits of rich silt replenish the fertile but overworked soil. The rivers also drain excess monsoon rainfall into the Bay of Bengal. Thus, the great river system is at the same time the country&#x27;s principal resource and its greatest hazard.

The profusion of rivers can be divided into five major networks. The Jamuna-Brahmaputra is long and extends from northern Bangladesh to its confluence with the Padma. Originating as the Yarlung Tsangpo River in China&#x27;s Xizang Autonomous Region (Tibet) and flowing through India&#x27;s state of Arunachal Pradesh, where it becomes known as the Brahmaputra (&quot;Son of Brahma&quot;), it receives waters from five major tributaries that total some in length. At the point, where the Brahmaputra meets the Tista River in Bangladesh, it becomes known as the Jamuna. The Jamuna is notorious for its shifting subchannels and for the formation of fertile silt islands (chars). No permanent settlements can exist along its banks.

The second system is the Padma-Ganges, which is divided into two sections: a segment, the Ganges, which extends from the western border with India to its confluence with the Jamuna some west of Dhaka, and a segment, the Padma, which runs from the Ganges-Jamuna confluence to where it joins the Meghna River at Chandpur. The Padma-Ganges is the central part of a deltaic river system with hundreds of rivers and streams—some in length—flowing generally east or west into the Padma.

The third network is the Surma-Meghna River System, which courses from the north-eastern border with India to Chandpur, where it joins the Padma. The Surma-Meghna, at by itself the longest river in Bangladesh, is formed by the union of six lesser rivers. Below the city of Kalipur it is known as the Meghna. When the Padma and Meghna join, they form the fourth river system—the Padma-Meghna—which flows to the Bay of Bengal.

This mighty network of four river systems flowing through the Bangladesh Plain drains an area of some . The numerous channels of the Padma-Meghna, its distributaries, and smaller parallel rivers that flow into the Bay of Bengal are referred to as the Mouths of the Ganges. Like the Jamuna, the Padma-Meghna and other estuaries on the Bay of Bengal are also known for their many chars.
A fifth river system, unconnected to the other four, is the Karnaphuli. Flowing through the region of Chittagong and the Chittagong Hills, it cuts across the hills and runs rapidly downhill to the west and southwest and then to the sea. The Feni, Karnaphuli, Sangu, and Matamuhari—an aggregate of some —are the main rivers in the region. The port of Chittagong is situated on the banks of the Karnaphuli. The Karnaphuli Reservoir and Karnaphuli Dam are located in this area. The dam impounds the Karnaphuli River&#x27;s waters in the reservoir for the generation of hydroelectric power.

The Ganga–Brahmaputra rivers contribute nearly 1000 million tons/yr of sediment. The sediment contributed from these two rivers forms the Bengal Delta and Submarine fan, a vast structure that extends from Bangladesh to the south of the Equator which is up to 16.5 km thick, and contains at least 1130 trillion tonnes of sediment accumulating over the last 17 million years at an average rate of 665 million tons/yr. The Bay of Bengal used to be deeper than the Mariana Trench, the present deepest ocean point.

During the annual monsoon period, the rivers of Bangladesh flow at about , but during the dry period they diminish to . Because water is vital to agriculture, more than 60% of the net arable land, some , is cultivated in the rainy season despite the possibility of severe flooding, and nearly 40% of the land is cultivated during the dry winter months. Water resources development has responded to this &quot;dual water regime&quot; by providing flood protection, drainage to prevent over flooding and waterlogging, and irrigation facilities for the expansion of winter cultivation. Major water control projects have been developed by the national government to provide irrigation, flood control, drainage facilities, aids to river navigation and road construction, and hydroelectric power. In addition, thousands of tube wells and electric pumps are used for local irrigation. Despite severe resource constraints, the Government of Bangladesh has made it a policy to try to bring additional areas under irrigation without salinity intrusion.

Water resources management, including gravity flow irrigation, flood control, and drainage, were largely the responsibility of the Bangladesh Water Development Board. Other public sector institutions, such as the Bangladesh Krishi Bank, the Bangladesh Rural Development Board, the Bangladesh Bank, and the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation were also responsible for the promotion and development of minor irrigation works in the private sector through government credit mechanisms.

==Coastal systems==

Bangladesh coastal areas are covering the south part of Bangladesh. The main rivers of Bangladesh derived from the Himalayas carry a high level of sediment and deposit it across the Bay of Bengal. This has led to major changes in the coastal region between 1989 and 2018. Over 30 years of morphological changes many islands are losing land area. However, there has been an overall net gain in the land area due to the regular acceleration process in other parts of those islands. In the west, new islands were found, but no significant changes were observed. At the mouth of the Meghna estuary, noticeable variable changes have been observed with the formation of many new islands.

In 1989, the land area was only 28835 km2 (56.06%), while the water area was 22600 km2 (43.94%) with the region falling among 20° 34&#x27; N to 26°38 N and 88° 01&#x27; E to 92° 41&#x27; E, and with an area of 147,570 km2. In 2018, the land area increased to 29426 km2 (57.21%); an increase of 590 km2 (1.15%). The land area in 1999 and 2009 was 56.49% and 56.68%, respectively, with a total increase of 0.19%. The island reformation tendency showed that the new land area increased every year by an average of 20 km2 (0.038) along the coastal region of Bangladesh. Plant growth has been observed in the newly formed islands over a period of 30 years. In the early stages, the islands are usually muddy waste areas that gradually changed into grasslands and Trees.

A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 2,262 km2 of tidal flats in Bangladesh and is therefore ranked 14th in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there. The analysis showed that the tidal flats of the Meghna River estuary have undergone considerable geomorphological change over a 33-year period, from 1984 to 2016, now only occurring in 17.1% of their initial extent despite expanding in area by 20.6%.

<text>Bangladesh is the eighth-most populated country in the world with almost 2.2% of the world&#x27;s population. As per the final results of the 2022 Census of Bangladesh, the country&#x27;s population is 169,828,911. Bangladesh has one of the highest population densities in the world.

Bangladesh (previously East Pakistan between 1947 and 1971 and East Bengal before 1947) is largely ethnically homogeneous and its name derives from the Bengali ethno-linguistic group which comprises 99% of the population. The Chittagong Hill Tracts, Sylhet, Mymensingh, Barisal and North Bengal regions are home to diverse tribal peoples. There are many dialects of Bengali spoken throughout the region. The dialect spoken by those in Chittagong and Sylhet are particularly distinctive. About (91.04%) of Bangladeshis are Muslims, followed by Hindus (largest-minority) at (7.95%), Buddhists (0.61%) and Christians (0.30%) and others (0.12%) as per 2022 census.

Bangladesh has one of the highest population densities in the world. The total fertility rate (TFR) has been reduced by more than two thirds since Independence. The current TFR in Bangladesh is 1.930 per woman, globally considered to be below the benchmark for replacement level fertility.

At this TFR and without migration, Bangladesh&#x27;s population is expected to soon reach a stage where it neither grows nor shrinks, once the top of its age pyramid fills in.

== Population ==

The April 2023 total population was 169,532,362, which makes Bangladesh the eighth-most populous country in the world.

===Population growth rate===

Bangladesh had high rates of population growth in the 1960s and 1970s. Since then however it has seen significant reduction in its total fertility rate. Over a period of three decades it dropped from almost 7 to 2 in 2005–2018.

=== Census ===
The latest decennial census was conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in 2022.

==Ethnic group==
The vast majority (about 99%) of Bangladeshis are of the Bengali ethno-linguistic group. This group also spans the neighboring Indian province of West Bengal. Minority ethnic groups include Meitei, Tripuri, Marma, Tanchangya, Barua, Khasi, Santhals, Chakma, Rakhine, Garo, Biharis, Oraons, and Mundas.

Biharis are Urdu-speaking, non-Bengalis who emigrated from the state of Bihar and other parts of northern India during the 1947 partition. They are concentrated in the Dhaka and Rangpur areas and number some 300,000. In the 1971 independence war many of them sided with Pakistan, as they stood to lose their positions in the upper levels of society. Hundreds of thousands went to Pakistan and those that remained were interned in refugee camps. Their population declined from about 1 million in 1971 to 600,000 in the late 1980s. Refugees International has called them a &quot;neglected and stateless&quot; people as they are denied citizenship by the governments of Bangladesh and Pakistan. As nearly 40 years has passed, two generations of Biharis have been born in these camps. Biharis were granted Bangladeshi citizenship and voting rights in 2008.

Bangladesh&#x27;s tribal population was enumerated at 897,828 in the 1981 census. These tribes are concentrated in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and around Mymensingh, Sylhet, and Rajshahi. They are of Sino-Tibetan descent and differ markedly in their social customs, religion, language and level of development. They speak Tibeto-Burman languages and most are Buddhist or Hindu. The four largest tribes are Chakmas, Marmas, Tipperas, Tanchangya, and Mros. Smaller groups include the Santals in Rajshahi and Dinajpur, and Khasis, Garos, and Khajons in Mymensingh and Sylhet regions.

There are small communities of Meitei people (alias Manipuri people) in the Sylhet district, which is close to the Meitei homeland across the border in Manipur, India.

There is a large population of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar near the border in the southeast. There are 28,000 living in two UN refugee camps in Cox&#x27;s Bazar as well as some 200,000 &quot;unregistered people of concern&quot; living outside of the camps. The refugee crisis originated in the early 1990s when the first wave numbering some 250,000 of the predominantly Muslim ethnic group fled persecution from their home in Rakhaine—Myanmar&#x27;s westernmost state. Bangladesh seeks to repatriate the refugees back to Myanmar. Since 2017, there are approximately 1.1 million Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh.

===Genetics===
Bangladesh has the world&#x27;s highest frequency of the M form of mitochondrial DNA. This genetic variant spans many continents, and is the single most common mtDNA haplogroup in Asia. In Bangladesh it represents about 83% of maternal lineages.

==Languages==

* Official language: Bengali (also known as Bangla)
* Other varieties that are variously considered as the dialects of Bengali: Chittagonian, Sylheti, and Rajbongshi.
* Bengali–Meitei creole language: Bishnupriya Manipuri
* Other Indic languages: Assamese, Rohingya, Chakma, Tanchangya and various Bihari languages
* Tibeto-Burman languages: A&#x27;Tong, Chak, Koch, Garo, Megam, Tripuri, Meitei language (Manipuri language), Mizo, Mru, Pangkhua, Rakhine/Marma, various Chin languages
* Austroasiatic languages: Khasi, Koda, Mundari, Pnar, Santali, War
* Dravidian languages: Kurukh
* Other languages: English &quot;(spoken and known widely in upper-class &amp; politics)&quot;, Arabic &quot;(sometimes spoken and known by many Muslims, due to Islam being the primary religion)&quot;, Hindi/Urdu &quot;(understood by some, and spoken by Biharis)&quot;

Bangladesh has 44 indigenous languages according to Professor Shameem Reza.

According to the Ethnologue, there are 36 indigenous living languages, which include 17 Sino-Tibetan, 10 Indo-European, 7 Austro-Asiatic and 2 Dravidian languages.

==Religion==


Bangladesh has a population of 165,158,616 as per 2022 census.

== Migration ==

===Immigration===
According to the United Nations, there were 1,500,921 international migrants in Bangladesh in 2017. Estimation shows that over 1 million Rohingya Muslim refugees live in Bangladesh have arrived during the ongoing Rohingya genocide in Myanmar. On 28 September 2018, at the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said there are 1.1-1.3 million Rohingya refugees now in Bangladesh.

Their most common countries of origin were as follows:

The United Nations has estimated the Bangladesh diaspora as 4,499,919 people with the greatest migration to the following countries:

<text>Thomas Ι (&quot;Tommaso I&quot;; 1178 – 1 March 1233) was Count of Savoy from 1189 to 1233. He is sometimes numbered &quot;Thomas I&quot; to distinguish him from his son of the same name. His long reign marked a decisive period in the history of Savoy.

==Biography==

Thomas was born in Aiguebelle, the son of Humbert III of Savoy and Beatrice of Viennois. He was still a minor when his father died in 1189, and his mother acted as regent until 1191 during his minority reign. Despite his youth he began the push northwest into new territories. In the same year he granted Aosta Valley the &quot;Charte des Franchises&quot;, recognising the right to administrative and political autonomy (this right was maintained until the French Revolution). Later he conquered Vaud, Bugey, and Carignano. He supported the Hohenstaufens, and was known as &quot;Thomas the Ghibelline&quot; because of his career as Imperial Vicar of Lombardy.

Thomas worked throughout his reign to expand the control and influence of the County of Savoy. One of the key tools that he used was his large number of children, whom he worked to get into positions of influence in neighbouring regions. In part, this was done by getting many of his sons into episcopal offices in surrounding territories, at a time when bishops had temporal as well as spiritual authority. In addition to William and Boniface, who made their careers in the clergy, their brother Thomas started out as a canon at Lausanne and became prévôt of Valence by 1226. Pietro was also a canon at Lausanne and served as acting bishop there until he was replaced in 1231. In 1219 he worked to get his daughter Beatrice married to the fourteen-year-old Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence. This established a close relationship between the two adjoining counties which would help cement Savoy&#x27;s control over trade between Italy and France.

Thomas fought many battles to expand his control. In 1215, his troops fought in an alliance with Milan against Monferrato, destroying the town of Casale. In 1222, he captured Cavour. He also worked through diplomatic and economic means to expand his control. The county of Savoy long enjoyed control over critical passes through the Alps. In his quest to gain more control over Turin, Thomas made an agreement with its rival Asti to reroute its French trade around Turin through Savoyard lands in a treaty on 15 September 1224. In 1226, Emperor Frederick II came to northern Italy and named Thomas Imperial Vicar of Lombardy. In this role, he mediated in a Genoese rebellion and a dispute between the town of Marseille and its bishop. Thomas also made a policy of granting franchises and charters to towns on key trade routes, which enabled the merchant class to develop more wealth and built support for his rule.

==Family and children==
In 1195, Thomas ambushed the party of Count William I of Geneva, which was escorting the count&#x27;s daughter, Margaret of Geneva, to France for her intended wedding to King Philip II of France. Thomas carried off Margaret and married her himself. They had:
:# Amadeus, married Margaret d&#x27;Albon and later married Cecile de Beaux

<text>Boniface of Savoy ( – 18 July 1270) was a medieval Bishop of Belley in Savoy and Archbishop of Canterbury in England. He was the son of Thomas, Count of Savoy and owed his initial ecclesiastical posts to his father. Other members of his family were also clergymen, and a brother succeeded his father as count. One niece Eleanor of Provence was married to King Henry III of England, and another was married to King Louis IX of France. It was Henry who secured Boniface&#x27;s election as Archbishop, and throughout his tenure of that office, he spent much time on the continent. He clashed with his bishops, with his nephew-by-marriage, and with the papacy but managed to eliminate the archiepiscopal debt that he had inherited on taking office. During Simon de Montfort&#x27;s struggle with King Henry, Boniface initially helped Montfort&#x27;s cause but later supported the king. After his death in Savoy, his tomb became the object of a cult, and he was eventually beatified in 1839.

==Early life==
Boniface and his elder brother Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy were sons of Thomas I, Count of Savoy, and Margaret of Geneva. He is thus not to be confused with his nephew and fellow member of the House of Savoy, Count Boniface of Savoy, the son of Amadeus IV. The elder Boniface was born about 1207 in Savoy. He was the eleventh child of his parents. Some sources state that at a young age he joined the Carthusian Order. However, there is no evidence of this, and it would have been very unusual for a nobleman to enter that order with its very strict discipline. He also had a brother Peter of Savoy who was named Earl of Richmond in 1240 and yet another brother William of Savoy, who was Bishop of Valence and a candidate to be Bishop of Winchester in England.

==Ecclesiastical career==

Boniface was the Prior of Nantua in 1232 along with the bishopric of Belley in Burgundy. When his father died, he received the castle of Ugine as his inheritance, and he surrendered any entitlement to any other inheritance in 1238. After the marriage of his niece, Eleanor of Provence to King Henry III of England, he came with a number of her relatives to England.

Henry attempted to have Boniface elected Bishop of Winchester but was unable to get the cathedral chapter to elect Boniface. On 1 February 1241 he was nominated to the see of Canterbury. Papal approval was delayed, however, by the opposition of Simon Langton, archdeacon of Canterbury, and by the deaths of two popes. Pope Innocent IV confirmed the appointment on 16 September 1243, as an attempt to placate Henry. Boniface did not, however, come to England until 1244 and was present, in the following year 1245, at the First Council of Lyon. There, he was consecrated by Innocent IV on 15 January at Lyons, but it was only in 1249 that he returned to England and was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 1 November 1249. Before he returned in 1249, he helped arrange the marriage another of his nieces, Beatrice of Provence, the sister of Queen Eleanor, to Charles of Anjou, the brother of King Louis IX of France.

The medieval chronicler Matthew Paris said that Boniface was &quot;noted more for his birth than for his brains.&quot; He showed little concern for the spiritual duties of his office. His exactions and his overbearing behaviour, combined with the fact that he was a foreigner, offended the English. He was heavily involved in advancing the fortunes of his family on the continent and spent fourteen of the twenty-nine years he was archbishop outside England. He made strenuous efforts to free his office from debt, as he had inherited a see that was in debt over 22,000 marks, but managed to clear the debt before his death. He did this by securing the right to tax his clergy, for seven years, from the papacy. When a number of bishops refused to pay, they were suspended from office. He also worked for the canonisation of Edmund of Abingdon while he was at the papal court-in-exile at Lyon from 1244 to 1249.

In 1244, Boniface rejected Robert Passelewe, who had been selected as Bishop of Chichester, on the grounds that Passelewe was illiterate. Boniface then nominated his own candidate, Richard of Chichester, and although the king objected, Pope Innocent IV confirmed Richard&#x27;s election. In 1258, Boniface objected to the selection of Hugh de Balsham as Bishop of Ely, and tried to elevate Adam Marsh instead, but Hugh appealed to Rome, which upheld Hugh&#x27;s election. Boniface held church councils to reform the clergy, in 1257 at London, in 1258 at Merton, and in 1261 at Lambeth.

During his archiepiscopate, a provincial court was established in the archdiocese of Canterbury, with a presiding &quot;Officialis&quot; appointed by Boniface.

==Controversies==
Boniface was energetic in defending the liberties of his see, and clashed with King Henry over the election of Henry&#x27;s clerk Robert Passelewe to the see of Chichester. Robert Grosseteste, the Bishop of Lincoln, had examined Passelewe, and found him unfit for episcopal office, and Boniface then quashed the election in 1244. He was also involved in disputes with the king&#x27;s half-brothers, especially Aymer de Valence, who was Bishop of Winchester. He also quarrelled with his suffragan bishops, who resented his attempts to supervise their affairs closely. In 1250 Boniface attempted a visitation of his province, and this disturbed his suffragan bishops, who protested that Boniface was taking exorbitant amounts of money during his visits. They appealed to the pope, who reaffirmed the right of Boniface to conduct his visitation but set a limit on the amount that could be taken from any monastery or church. After the visitation, Boniface left England again and only returned in 1252, after the pope had decided the bishops&#x27; appeal in Boniface&#x27;s favour. After his return, he continued to assert his rights and settled a number of disputes with his bishops. He secured professions of obedience from all but three of the 37 bishops consecrated during his time as archbishop. He also set up a court at Canterbury that heard appeals from the ecclesiastical courts of his suffragan bishops.

Boniface clashed with Henry&#x27;s half-brothers, the Lusignans, who arrived in England in 1247 and competed for lands and promotions with the queens&#x27; Savoy relatives. Boniface&#x27;s quarrel with Aymer de Valence over a hospital in Southwark led to the archbishop&#x27;s palace at Lambeth being plundered and one of Boniface&#x27;s functionaries being kidnapped. The dispute with Aymer was only settled in early 1253. Boniface was once more absent from England from October 1254 to November 1256, and spent most of that time in Savoy where he attempted to help his brothers rescue their eldest brother Thomas who was being held captive at Turin.

In 1258 and 1259, Boniface was a member of the Council of Fifteen, which conducted business for Henry III under the Provisions of Oxford. This Council consisted of the earls of Leicester, Gloucester, Norfolk, Warwick, Hereford, the Count of Aumale, Peter of Savoy, John fitzGeoffrey, Peter de Montfort, Richard Grey, Roger Mortimer, James Audley, John Maunsell, Walter de Cantilupe, Bishop of Worcester as well as Boniface. One of the actions of this council was to send the Lusignans into exile. In April 1260, Boniface worked with Richard of Cornwall to broker a peace between King Henry and Prince Edward.

Boniface accompanied the queen and Prince Edward to Burgos for the marriage of Edward to Eleanor of Castile and Edward&#x27;s knighting. But in 1261 Boniface held a church council at Lambeth, where a series of ecclesiastical laws were published which denounced any royal limitations on ecclesiastical courts. These decrees were done without royal consent and thus was tantamount to an ecclesiastical revolt against royal authority similar to the baronial opposition movement that had begun in 1258.

During the Second Barons&#x27; War, Boniface seems to have sided first with the English bishops against King Henry, but later he sided with Henry. In 1262, he went to France, excommunicating the barons opposing the king. He was not summoned to the Parliament at London in January 1265 because he was abroad. On the triumph of the king&#x27;s party in 1265, he returned to England, arriving there in May 1266.

==Death and aftermath==

The Early English Gothic chapel of Lambeth Palace dates from work carried out while Boniface was archbishop. Boniface left England in November 1268 and never returned. He died 18 July 1270, in Savoy. He was buried with his family in the Cistercian abbey of Hautecombe in Savoy. In his will, he left legacies to all the houses of the Franciscans and Dominicans in the diocese of Canterbury. His will had differing provisions for his burial depending on whether he died in England, France, or near the Alps. Oddly enough, his official seal included a head of the pagan god Jupiter Serapis along with the usual depiction of the archbishop in full vestments.

After his death, Boniface&#x27;s tomb was the center of a cult, and when the tomb was opened in 1580, his body was found to be perfectly preserved. The tomb and effigy were destroyed in the French Revolution, his remains were reburied and a new tomb built in 1839. He was beatified by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839, and his feast day is 14 July.

Although Matthew Paris disapproved of Boniface, modern historians have seen him as a responsible archbishop. The historian D. A. Carpenter says that Boniface &quot;became a respected and reforming archbishop&quot;. His episcopal registers do not survive.

<text>Politics of Bangladesh takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic, whereby the Prime Minister of Bangladesh is the head of government and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament. The Constitution of Bangladesh was written in 1972 and has undergone seventeen amendments.

The current parliamentary system was adopted in 1991 and is based on the Westminster system. Between 1975 and 1990, the nation experienced military rule. A caretaker government was first introduced in 1990, after the resignation of military dictator Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad (Ershad) to observe a neutral democratic election, as per demands of the two major political parties Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Awami League (AL). Following the forced resignation of Ershad, Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed was nominated as the Chief Advisor and observed the 1991 general election. A Caretaker government is headed by a Chief Adviser who enjoys the same power as the regular prime minister of the country except defense matters. The Advisors function as Ministers. After 1991, the Caretaker government has also held the elections of 1996, 2001 and 2008. Although, the first caretaker government was intended to help the transition from authoritarianism to democracy, this system was institutionalized in 1996, by the Sixth Parliament due to rising mistrust between the BNP and AL. In 2011, the then ruling party AL abolished the caretaker government system. This has been the biggest cause of dispute among many others between the BNP and the AL since then.

==Political parties and elections==

The two major parties in Bangladesh are the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Bangladesh Awami League. Traditionally, the BNP finds its allies among some Islamist parties like Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh while the Awami League aligns itself with leftist and secular parties such as Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. Although in recent times, BNP is aligning with leftist parties and Awami League is acting independently. Another important player is the Jatiya Party, headed by late Hussain Muhammad Ershad&#x27;s brother GM Quader. The Awami League-BNP rivalry has been bitter and punctuated by protests, violence and murder. Student politics is particularly strong in Bangladesh, a legacy from the liberation movement era. Almost all parties have highly active student wings, and students have been elected to the parliament.

Three radical Islamist parties, Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh (JMJB) and Jama&#x27;atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), Harkatul Jihad were banned in February 2004 on grounds of militancy and terrorism. Following the first series of bans, a series of bomb attacks took place in the country in August 2005. The evidence of staging these attacks by these extremist groups have been found in the investigation, and hundreds of suspected members were detained in numerous security operations in 2006, including the two chiefs of the JMB, Shaykh Abdur Rahman and Bangla Bhai, who were executed with other top leaders in March 2007, bringing the radical parties to an end.

==Local governance==
==Nepotism and dynastic politics==

Political dynasties are a common occurrence in East Asia, and have been prevalent in Bangladesh since it gained independence. A political dynasty usually refers to a party or any political body run by a single family, with long-established economic or political dominance passed down or inherited. The influence of political dynasties often spills over to the general public sphereand prevalence of this phenomenon has the potential to discourage civil society organizations from taking part in politics 

There are several suggested explanations for the prevalence and success of dynastic politics.

# The name becomes synonymous with success and leadership, while connections and political capital.
# Leaders who are connected in collective memory to momentous events are perceived as possessing positive characters such as courage and assertiveness, that can be passed onto the next generation.
# The above explanation can be applied to parties themselves - party members tend to support candidates that are related to previously successful ones, due to the perception of inherited traits. 
# A tendency for traditionalism, especially in societies where family relations and kinship are central to the culture.
# Poorer constituencies tend to gravitate towards wealthier, more well-educated politicians, that represent leadership skills as they perceive them.

Two major political dynasties, one led by former prime minister Khaleda Zia, the widow of former military ruler Ziaur Rahman, who has led the BNP since 1981, and her son Tarique Rahman, alongside the prime minister Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who has led the AL since 1981, are known for their rivalry.

In recent years, increased awareness of the adverse effects of this political system has caused some shift in public perception.

==Political issues==
===Corruption===

Bangladesh has seen political corruption for decades. According to all major ranking institutions, Bangladesh routinely finds itself among the most corrupt countries in the world.

===Social issues===
Social issues in Bangladesh range from liberal inceptions such as women&#x27;s rights, religious liberty, religious freedom, modernity, industrialization to religious issues such as blasphemy laws, sharia legal system, religious conservatism and state religion. The two main parties, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Awami League, both have contested against each other since the millennium over these issues.

==History==
===Background, Independence movement and Provisional Government===
After the British conquest of Bengal on 23 June 1757 and the overthrowing and execution of Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah, considered as the last independent ruler of the region before regaining independence 200 years later, the Bengal Presidency was divided in British India in the year 1947, as East Bengal and West Bengal mainly on religious grounds. East Bengal allied itself with the newly formed Muslim state of Pakistan and became known as East Pakistan. However the relations between West Pakistan and East Pakistan were politically strained due to various issues of inequality, language, culture and a large distance of over 2,000 kilometres between the two states separated by the foreign lands of India. The central power remained confined in West Pakistan, thus demand for total independent rule of East Pakistan begun. Following the Six point movement in 1966, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the East Pakistan independence movement gained momentum.

On 5 December 1969, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman stated after independence East Pakistan will be renamed Bangladesh. The situation escalated after the 1970 elections and the 7 March 1971 speech of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. After a brutal Pakistani army crackdown on the local people of Bangladesh on 25 March 1971 carried out under orders of Pakistan President Yahya Khan, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Chief of Awami League and the leader of the liberation movement declared independence on 26 March 1971, which was broadcast from Chittagong radio station on 27 March, first by the then Awami League Secretary of Chittagong Mr Abdul Hannan and other Awami League leaders and then by Major Ziaur Rahman on behalf of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in the evening of 27 March, thus starting the Bangladesh Liberation War. Captain Rafiq BU Commanding Officer of Chittagong East Pakistan Rifles revolted first and subsequently other commanding officers at different places: Major Shafiullah, Major Khaled Musharraf and Major Ziaur Rahman revolted with their forces. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested by the Pakistan Army in early hours of 26 March, immediately after he declared independence and was taken to West Pakistan, where he remained in jail until early January 1972.

Bangladesh&#x27;s first government formed on 10 April 1971 and took the oath of office in Meherpur, Kushtia on 17 April 1971. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was elected as the first president of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh, Syed Nazrul Islam was elected as the vice president, and Tajuddin Ahmed was elected as the first prime minister. Other major cabinet members were Mr Kamruzzaman, Mr Monsur Ali and Khodokar Mustaq Ahmed, all senior Awami League leaders. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman by virtue of his position as the president of Bangladesh became the Supreme Commander of the Liberation Army, while Colonel M.A.G. Osmani was appointed by the provisional government as the Commander-in- Chief of the liberation army. Subsequently, the provisional government formed its secretariat and designated top bureaucrats as chiefs of the divisions of the Secretariat. The Provisional Government later divided Bangladesh into eleven Sectors for conducting war efficiently and in an organized manner. This Government became the first legal political entity on behalf of the fighting people of Bangladesh and represented the people in the international arena. Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmed started intergovernmental dialogue with the Indian Government immediately after the formation of the Provisional Government. Bangladesh achieved victory in the liberation war on 16 December 1971.

As this government was formed during the war of independence from Pakistan, its significance holds a distinction. Its temporary headquarters had been set up at 8 Theatre Road in Calcutta, India.

===First Parliamentary Era===
====1972–1975: Sheikh Mujibur Rahman====

On 8 January 1972, the leader of the Liberation War and Liberation movement Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was released from Pakistan Jail and was sent to London. On Mujib&#x27;s arrival in London, he was met by the Prime Minister of UK and other world leaders. Sheikh Mujib returned to Bangladesh on 10 January 1972, by a British Royal Air Force Aircraft. Mujib congratulated the Bengali Mukti Bahini (the Bangladesh Liberation Force) for succeeding in the war of liberation against Pakistan army. Mujib was placed at the helm of government, according to the election victory under the unified Pakistan government. In 1973, after the first Bangladesh elections, he continued his term in office with immense backing from India, and public popularity, but had great difficulty transforming this popular support into the political strength needed to function as head of government. The new constitution, which came into force on 16 December 1972, created a strong executive prime minister, a largely ceremonial presidency, an independent judiciary, and a unicameral legislature on a modified Westminster model. The 1972 constitution adopted as state policy the Awami League&#x27;s (AL) four basic principles of nationalism, secularism, socialism, and democracy. A key author of the constitution of Bangladesh was Dr Kamal Hossain, who has since been a major political figure of the country.

The first parliamentary elections held under the 1972 constitution were in March 1973, with the Awami League winning a massive majority, winning a historic 293 out of a total of 300 seats. No other political party in Bangladesh&#x27;s early years was able to duplicate or challenge the League&#x27;s broad-based appeal, membership, or organizational strength. Mujib and his cabinet having no experience in governance nor administration, relied heavily on experienced civil servants and political factions of the Awami League, the new Bangladesh Government focused on relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of the economy and society. Mujib nationalised the entire economy, banking and industrial sector. Economic conditions took a serious downturn. On top of that heavy corruption among his own party members, factions and senior leadership also added to the devastation and famine. The then U.S. Secretary of State had termed Bangladesh a Bottomless Basket. Amid mass corruption and famine throughout 1974, in December 1974, Mujib decided that continuing economic deterioration and mounting civil disorder required strong measures. After proclaiming a state of emergency, Mujib used his parliamentary majority to win a constitutional amendment limiting the powers of the legislative and judicial branches, establishing an executive presidency, and instituting a one-party system, the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL), which all members of Parliament were obliged to join.

Despite promises, no sign of improvement in the economic situation surfaced. Implementation of promised political reforms was almost nil, and criticism of government policies became increasingly centered on Mujib. Serious disorientation in the armed services, disenchantment in society, deterioration of law and order created a huge mistrust of Mujib and his government including the Awami League itself. The then chief of army staff K M Shafiullah and chief of air staff A.K. Khandker stood stunned and idle during this situation. On 15 August 1975, Mujib, and most of his family, were assassinated by a small group of mid-level army officers. Mujib&#x27;s daughters, Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, happened to be out of the country. A new government, headed by former Mujib associate Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, was formed.

===Military Era===
====August–November 1975: Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad====
Mujib&#x27;s senior cabinet minister Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad formed a new government and immediately initiated a few critical changes in Mujib&#x27;s policies and rules of business in government. The notorious Jail Killings happened during this period, amidst the confusion in which Bangladesh was plunged on 3 November. On the same day, Brig General Khaled Mosharraf launched his own coup fundamentally as a move to restore the chain of command broken in the army Musharraf moved swiftly to remove Moshtaque Ahmad from office. On 7 November Khaled Musharaf was killed in a counter coup engineered by Colonel Abu Taher.

====1975–1981: Ziaur Rahman====

Following Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad&#x27;s removal and assassination of Brigadier General Khaled Musharaf by a segment of army personnel in 1975, a very short lived revolution resulted in the emergence of arrested deputy Army Chief of Staff Major General Ziaur Rahman (&quot;Zia&quot;), who managed to take the lead and bring the whole nation out of a political quagmire. His first action was to communicate to the people through radio and television and bring order and calm to the nation. He pledged full support to the civilian government headed by President Chief Justice Sayem. Acting at Zia&#x27;s behest, Sayem dissolved Parliament, and instituted state of emergency under martial law. Zia brought an end to the turbulence within the army. In 1976, Colonel Abu Taher was tried for treason and executed. Fresh elections were to be in 1977 under a multi party democracy with full freedom of the press.

Acting behind the scenes of the Martial Law Administration (MLA), Zia sought to invigorate government policy and administration. Lifting the ban on political parties from Mujib&#x27;s one party BAKSAL rule, he sought to revitalize the demoralized bureaucracy, to begin new economic development programs, infrastructure buildup, a free press and to emphasize family planning. In November 1976, Zia became Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) and assumed the presidency upon Sayem&#x27;s retirement 5 months later, on 21 April 1977.

As President, Zia announced a 19-point program of economic reform and began dismantling the MLA. Keeping his promise to hold elections, Zia won a 5-year term in the June 1978 elections, with 76% of the vote. In November 1978, his government removed the remaining restrictions on political party activities in time for parliamentary elections in February 1979. These elections, which were contested by more than 30 parties, marked the culmination of Zia&#x27;s transformation of Bangladesh&#x27;s Government from the MLA to a democratically elected, constitutional one. The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), founded by Zia, emerged as the two major parties. The constitution was again amended to provide for an executive prime minister appointed by the president, and responsible to a parliamentary majority. Zia invigorated a strong foreign policy based on sovereignty and economic independence. He initiated many social programs to uplift the poor through honest hard work and education. During this period, Bangladesh&#x27;s economy achieved fast economic and industrial growth. His greatest legacy on the people of Bangladesh was unity and self-dependence.

In May 1981, Zia was assassinated in Chittagong by dissident elements of the military. There was no coup or uprising attempted, and the major conspirators were never taken into custody or killed. In accordance with the constitution, Vice President Justice Abdus Sattar was sworn in as acting president. He immediately set out to continue Zia&#x27;s policies and called for fresh elections. Due to President Zia&#x27;s tremendous popularity Sattar won as the BNP&#x27;s candidate. President Sattar sought to follow the policies of his predecessor and retained essentially the same cabinet.

====1982–1990: Hussain Mohammad Ershad====

Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Hussain Mohammad Ershad assumed power in a full-fledged but bloodless coup on 24 March 1982. He removed the country&#x27;s democratically elected president and suspended the constitution and declared martial law. He cited pervasive corruption, ineffectual government, and economic mismanagement for legitimising his action. The following year, Ershad assumed the presidency on 11 December 1983, retaining his positions as army chief and CMLA, for the first time in Bangladesh. During most of 1984, Ershad sought the opposition parties&#x27; participation in local elections under martial law. The opposition&#x27;s refusal to participate, however, forced Ershad to abandon these plans. Ershad was capable of managing the Awami League through financial and political support. The Awami League&#x27;s support gave him the strength and legitimacy to seek public support for his regime in a national referendum on his leadership in March 1985. He won overwhelmingly, although turnout was small. Two months later, Ershad held elections for local council chairmen. Pro-government candidates won a majority of the posts, setting in motion the President&#x27;s ambitious decentralization program that Ziaur Rahman had initiated. Political life was finally liberalized in early 1986, and additional political rights, including the right to hold large public rallies, were restored. Additional support from Jamaati Islami at the same time gave Ershad&#x27;s political vehicle for the transition from martial law some form of legitimacy and the political order of Ershad and his Jatiya Party was established.

Despite a boycott by the BNP, led Begum Khaleda Zia, parliamentary elections were held on schedule on 7 May 1986. The Jatiya Party won a modest majority of the 300 elected seats in the national assembly. The participation of the Awami League led by party chairman Sheikh Hasina Wazed—lent the elections some credibility, despite widespread charges of voting irregularities and ballot box theft.

Ershad resigned as Army Chief of Staff and retired from military service in preparation for the presidential elections, scheduled for October 1986. Protesting that martial law was still in effect, the BNP refused to put up opposing candidates. The Awami League participated by breaking their open public promise. Ershad easily outdistanced the remaining candidates, taking 84% of the vote. Although Ershad&#x27;s government claimed a turnout of more than 50%, opposition leaders of BNP, and much of the foreign press, estimated a far lower percentage and alleged voting irregularities.

Ershad continued his stated commitment to lift martial law. In November 1986, his government mustered the necessary two-thirds majority in the national assembly to amend the constitution and confirm the previous actions of the martial law regime. The President then lifted martial law, and the opposition party Awami League of Hasina Wazed took their elected seats in the national assembly.

In July 1987, however, after the government hastily pushed through a controversial legislative bill to include military representation on local administrative councils. Passage of the bill helped spark an opposition movement by Bangladesh Nationalist Party that quickly gathered momentum. The Awami League and Jamaat Islami. understanding their political gamble, gradually united with Bangladesh Nationalist Party for the first time. The government began to arrest scores of opposition activists under the country&#x27;s Special Powers Act of 1974. Despite these arrests, opposition parties continued to organize protest marches and nationwide strikes. After declaring a state of emergency, Ershad dissolved Parliament and scheduled fresh elections for March 1988.

All major opposition parties refused government overtures to participate in these polls, maintaining that the government was illegal and incapable of holding free and fair elections. Despite the opposition boycott, the government proceeded. The ruling Jatiya Party won 251 of the 300 seats. The Parliament, while still regarded by the opposition as an illegitimate body, held its sessions as scheduled, and passed numerous bills.

By 1989, the domestic political situation in the country seemed to have quieted. The local council elections were generally considered by international observers to have been less violent and more free and fair than previous elections. However, opposition to Ershad&#x27;s rule began to regain momentum, escalating by the end of 1990 in frequent general strikes, increased student&#x27;s campus protests, public rallies, and a general disintegration of law and order. This was popularly termed the 1990 Mass Uprising in Bangladesh.

On 6 December 1990, after 2 months of widespread civil unrest, Ershad offered his resignation. On 27 February 1991, an interim government oversaw what most observers widely believed to be the nation&#x27;s most free and fair elections to date.

===Current Parliamentary Era===
====1991–1996: Khaleda Zia====

The center-right BNP won a plurality of seats in the 1991 Bangladesh General Election and formed a coalition government with the Islamic party Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, with Khaleda Zia, widow of Ziaur Rahman, obtaining the post of prime minister. Only four parties had more than 10 members elected to the 1991 Parliament: The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia; the Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina; the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), led by Golam Azam; and the Jatiya Party (JP), led by acting chairman Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury while its founder, former President Ershad, served out a prison sentence on corruption charges. The electorate approved still more changes to the constitution, formally re-creating a parliamentary system and returning governing power to the office of the prime minister, as in Bangladesh&#x27;s original 1972 constitution. In October 1991, members of Parliament elected a new head of state, President Abdur Rahman Biswas.

In March 1994, controversy over a parliamentary by-election, which the opposition claimed the government had rigged, led to an indefinite boycott of Parliament by the entire opposition. The opposition also began a program of repeated general strikes to press its demand that Khaleda Zia&#x27;s government resign and a caretaker government supervise a general election. Efforts to mediate the dispute, under the auspices of the Commonwealth Secretariat, failed. After another attempt at a negotiated settlement failed narrowly in late December 1994, the opposition resigned en masse from Parliament. The opposition then continued a campaign of Marches, demonstrations, and strikes in an effort to force the government to resign. The year 1995 observed nearly 200 days of general strikes disrupting the countries normal activities. The opposition, including the Awami League&#x27;s Sheikh Hasina, pledged to boycott national elections scheduled for 15 February 1996.

In February, Khaleda Zia was re-elected for the second term by a landslide in voting boycotted and denounced as unfair by the three main opposition parties. In March 1996, following escalating political turmoil, the sitting Parliament enacted a constitutional amendment to allow a neutral caretaker government to assume power conduct new parliamentary elections; former Chief Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman was named Chief Advisor (a position equivalent to prime minister) in the interim government. New parliamentary elections were held in June 1996, and were won by the Awami League; party leader Sheikh Hasina became prime minister.

====1996–2001: Sheikh Hasina====
Sheikh Hasina formed what she called a &quot;Government of National Consensus&quot; in June 1996, which included one minister from the Jatiya Party and another from the Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal, a very small leftist party. The Jatiya Party never entered into a formal coalition arrangement, and party president H.M. Ershad withdrew his support from the government in September 1997. Only three parties had more than 10 members elected to the 1996 Parliament: The Awami League, BNP, and Jatiya Party. Jatiya Party president, Ershad, was released from prison on bail in January 1997.

BNP staged a walkout from parliament in August 1997. The BNP returned to Parliament under another agreement in March 1998. In June 1999, the BNP and other opposition parties again began to abstain from attending Parliament. Opposition parties have staged an increasing number of nationwide general strikes, rising from 6 days of general strikes in 1997 to 27 days in 1999. A four-party opposition alliance formed at the beginning of 1999 announced that it would boycott parliamentary by-elections and local government elections unless the government took steps demanded by the opposition to ensure electoral fairness. The government did not take these steps, and the opposition has subsequently boycotted all elections, including municipal council elections in February 1999, several parliamentary by-elections, and the Chittagong city corporation elections in January 2000. The opposition demands that the Awami League government step down immediately to make way for a caretaker government to preside over parliamentary and local government. In March 2000, US President Bill Clinton became the first US president to visit Bangladesh. Hasina later stated that during the visit Clinton wanted to import gas from the Country, but she had to decline due to fear of scarcity of gas and for the welfare of the people as they were heavily dependent on gas.

====2001–2006: Khaleda Zia====
A Khaleda-led four-party alliance won two-thirds of total parliamentary seats with a total 193 seats, while Awami League won 62 seats. Thus Khaleda Zia won a second term as prime minister in 2001. Her coalition included several Islamist parties. The Awami League walked out from the Parliament in June 2003 to protest derogatory remarks about Sheikh Hasina by a State Minister and the allegedly partisan role of the Parliamentary Speaker. Throughout the year 2004 the opposition party Awami League carried out various processions pressing various demands and claiming government incompetence on various issues. In June 2004, the Awami League returned to Parliament without having any of their demands met.

On 21 August 2004, a group of terrorists conducted vicious grenade attacks on a rally held by the opposition party Awami League including leader Sheikh Hasina. Prominent leaders including Ivy Rahman were killed in the attack, and Hasina herself sustained injuries to her ears. A total of 13 grenades were blasted and 24 people killed. The Awami League called for a nationwide hartal (general strikes) on 23 and 24 August 2004 following the incident. Begum Khaleda Zia, then Prime Minister of Bangladesh condemned the attacks, and also vowed a strong probe to catch the culprits. But no charge sheet was provided by the investigating departments. Only after the current government tenure ended a neutral probe formed and charge sheet was provided includes terrorist Mufti Hannan. Later, during Awami League tenure another probe formed and alleged that Tarique Rahman son of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia along with the then Home Minister Lutfuzzaman Babar had masterminded the attack. But BNP has denied the allegations.

In 2005, Awami League attended Parliament irregularly before announcing a boycott of the entire June 2005 budget session. The BNP government tenure expired in October 2006, and was followed by a period of widespread political crisis.

====2006–2008: Caretaker government: Fakhruddin Ahmed====
Following the end of Khaleda Zia&#x27;s government in late October 2006, there were protests and strikes over uncertainty about who would head the caretaker government (which was accused of BNP bias), held by Awami League, paralyzing the country and resulting in the death of at least 40 people in the following month in November 2006.
An election was scheduled for the beginning of 2007, however it did not take place. Given the parties&#x27; failure to agree on a candidate For Chief Advisor, according to the constitution the position devolved to the President, Iajuddin Ahmed, serving since 2002. He took it on in addition to his regular responsibilities, which under the caretaker government included the Defense Ministry. Iajuddin Ahmed formed a government, appointing ten advisors to a council to act as ministers. He appointed his press spokesman, the journalist-editor turned politician M Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury, as his chief Presidential Advisor, with the status of Minister of State. Chowdhury had the responsibility to negotiate with the political parties to bring them to participation in the election. In January 2007, Iajuddin Ahmed stepped down as the head of the caretaker government, under pressure from the military.

Fakhruddin Ahmed, former World Bank economist, was selected to replace him and with the commitment to rooting out corruption and preparing a better voter list. Fakhruddin Ahmed became the Chief Advisor. A State of Emergency was declared and a massive campaign to crack down on corruption was undertaken. By July 2007, some 200,000 people had been arrested under corruption charges. The government said it would hold elections before the end of 2008.

In April 2007, Ahmed&#x27;s military backed administration attempted to reform the political parties by exiling Hasina and Zia, but this was never enforced. Hasina, who had been visiting her children in the US, was allowed to return but she had to face serious charges, including involvement in the assassination of four political rivals. In July, she was arrested after two businessmen testified that she had extorted ৳80 million (US$1.16 million) from them. This provoked angry protests from her supporters; even her bitter rival Khaleda Zia, as well as six British MPs and MEPs, called for her release. Khaleda herself faced charges of tax evasion and was later arrested. Tarique Rahman was taken to custody for the 2004 grenade attacks and various corruption charges including money laundering, and was later sent on forced exile on 11 September 2008 and since then has not been able to return to the country. After holding power for almost two years, the political situation had finally calmed and Ahmed decided to return parliamentary democracy, testing the political situation with some local elections held on 4 August 2008, which were peaceful. Both Hasina and Khaleda were finally released from prison and the General elections were held on 29 December 2008. The Awami League and its Grand Alliance won the elections with two-thirds of the seats in parliament. The BNP and its four-party alliance, including Jamaat-e-Islami, comprised the major opposition.

====2009–2024: Sheikh Hasina====
The Awami League came to power by winning the vast majority of parliament seats in the election held on 29 December 2008, and Sheikh Hasina became the Prime Minister of Bangladesh for the second time. Her cabinet took oath on 6 January 2009. HM Ershad was promised to be made President in exchange for support for Awami League, but despite supporting Awami League, this promise was not fulfilled and Zillur Rahman became president. The first two years under this government was peaceful, but a debatable issue took place when the Awami League government enforced an existing law to reclaim the house where Khaleda Zia had lived for nearly 40 years for a nominal cost. Khaleda Zia moved to the house of her brother Sayeed Iskandar at Gulshan. In protest BNP would abstain from parliament. This period also observed tremendous economic growth.

Controversy erupted in 2011 after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared the abolition of the care-taker government system, contradicting her own motives and views in the mid-1990s when she had demanded that elections should be held under neutral care-taker governments. Hasina justified this by stating that a neutral care-taker government may abuse its power (referring to the care-taker government crisis in 2006–2008) and take unlawful and autocratic control of the country. At the same time, arrests and trials of members accused of war crimes of the political party Jamaat-e-Islami had begun. This caused major disagreements among the ruling Awami League with the chief opposition party BNP and its major ally Jamaat. In a bid to return to the 1972 Constitution, the government made several reforms to the constitution of Bangladesh in 2011, and readopted Secularism. In 2012, a coup attempt against Hasina by mid-ranking army officers was stopped, with Bangladesh army being tipped off by Indian intelligence agency. Also in 2012, Bangladesh won a legal battle against Myanmar under international court regarding disputed sea territories, giving Bangladesh a tremendous advantage on the oceanic areas.

The period 2012-2014 was marked by widespread political unrest and violence in strikes and riots initiated by the opposition party. Petrol bombs were utilized for arson attacks. Members of both the ruling party and opposition party clashed throughout the whole nation resulting in injuries and deaths. Both the ruling party and the opposition received International criticism. The scheduled date of the 10th general election was 5 January 2014. The opposition party received several pleas by the ruling party to abandon their path of violence and join the election, but they repeatedly declined. Despite the crisis the controversial 5 January 2014 election was held with mass boycott from BNP and its major allies. At least 21 people were killed on the 5 January election day violence. Awami League had a landslide victory, and Sheikh Hasina was sworn in as prime minister for the third time on 9 January 2014, while Rowshan Ershad of the Jatiya Party became the new leader of the opposition, as Khaleda-led BNP boycotted the election. The ongoing BNP-Jamaat protests diluted after failing to stop the January 2014 election, and overthrow the ruling party, and by the end of March 2014, political stability was reached.

In the tenth general election, Sheikh Hasina won a controversial one-sided walkover election after her main rival Khaleda Zia and all other opposition parties boycotted the polls. Awami League once again took office on 9 January 2014. Over 100 people were killed in the 2016 Union Parishad Election in violent clashes between Awami League and BNP supporters. In April 2017 Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made a landmark visit to neighboring India and signed 22 new deals and MoUs with India taking the Indo-BD bilateral relationships to a new height. This also included a defense cooperation, originally proposed by India. BNP harshly criticized the move with Khaleda alleging the ruling party was selling Bangladesh to India and pointing the Government&#x27;s failure to make the long-awaited Teesta deal. Awami League dismissed the allegations, assuring that it was just a framework to strengthen regional ties with India. Also in 2017 Bangladesh was met with the 2017 Rohingya Refugee Crisis, in which the government received international praise for allowing over 700,000 Rohingya refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar (where around 20,000 of them were killed) into the country but also some domestic criticisms due to this being an additional burden to Bangladesh a country already overpopulated with 17 crore (170 million) people and having a small land.

Most of the post 2014 election period however saw political calm. Tensions between the BNP and Awami League reignited in 2018 after BNP once again started pressing demands for a neutral caretaker government to observe the 11th general election. BNP also criticized Awami League&#x27;s rising dependency on law enforcement agencies such as the police force and for holding back people&#x27;s freedom of speech. On 8 February 2018 Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman as per court verdict, were jailed for 5 and 10 years respectively due to their involvement in the Zia Charitable Trust corruption case. While Tarique was on exile, Khaleda would be imprisoned on old Dhaka Central Jail located in Nazimuddin Road. BNP totally rejected the verdict, alleging that it was Awami League&#x27;s conspiracy to destroy their party and to keep them out of the next general election. In protest BNP held nationwide demonstrations, which were foiled by the well prepared police force across the nation, with a large number of BNP members also being arrested during clashes with the police. After Khaleda Zia was jailed, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and prominent leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi oversaw most of the party&#x27;s activities. After Khalada Zia&#x27;s prison sentence was challenged at the High Court, it was increased to 10 years, potentially ending her political career. During this time the government passed the controversial &quot;Digital Security Act 2018&quot;, under which any criticisms of the government over the internet or any other media, would be met with various degrees of prison terms.

On 22 September 2018, in a massive rally, the newly formed coalition party: Jatiya Oikya Prokriya (JOP), a platform led by Dr. Kamal Hossain and Prof. Badruddoza Chowdhury, allied themselves with the main opposition party BNP, on condition BNP will no longer be alliance with Jamaat, and vowed joint movements to restore democracy. The BNP-JOP alliance was named the Jatiya Oikya Front. The Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader called the opposing Jatiya Oikya Front, weak and stated that the opposing alliance was not being viewed as a credible threat by the Government. On 10 October 2018, court verdict against the 2004 grenade attack was given. Top BNP leader Lutfuzzaman Babar was given the death penalty and Tariqe Rahman was given life term imprisonment. BNP rejected the verdict and carried out protests against it. During this time, Kamal Hossain as the leader of the Jatiya Oikya Front became the main opposition leader.

The 2018 Bangladeshi general election was held on 30 December 2018. On the election day at least 14 people died in violence between the Awami League supporters and the Jatiya Oikya Front supporters. The Awami League returned to power winning 259 out of 300 parliamentary seats, making up the largest government body in Bangladesh after 1973 (where Awami League had won 293 out of 300 seats). The Jatiya Oikya Front only won 7 seats and alleged the 2018 election to be rigged and opted to boycott the parliament and stated that they would demand for fresh elections. The Jatiya Party became the main opposition party with only 20 seats.

Bangladesh Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s new cabinet took oath on 3 January 2019. Despite refusing to sell gas (LPG) at a better deal to the US back in 2000, in October 2019 Sheikh Hasina in a contradictory statement controversially stated that she will sell LPG to India despite the scarcity of LPG in Bangladesh (BD). Hasina also stated she will give India free access to extract BD&#x27;s Feni water, despite her failure to secure the Teesta river sharing deal. The dispute between Bangladesh and Myanmar over the unresolved Rohingya Refugee Crisis continued during this period, with Myanmar&#x27;s unwillingness to take back the refugees. In October 2020 Myanmar deployed their army troops on the Bangladesh border. Bangladesh appealed to the UN Security Council to prevent any escalation. Later Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina assured &quot;a safe zone must be created for the Rohingyas Refugees. If that is done, Myanmar will face a huge problem in the Rakhine region. I don&#x27;t think Myanmar will lock in war with Bangladesh; China will not let that happen.&quot; No further escalations have been reported, Bangladesh and Myanmar have since remained in peace militarily, but the diplomatic dispute continues to be debated at the UN.

Since the 2018 General Election the nation witnessed four years of political calm. But in 2022 BNP increasingly started to criticize the Awami League Government over rising inflationary crisis, including unsustainable fuel and energy price hikes as well as massive power outage despite the Government&#x27;s promise to implement 100% electricity in the nation. While price levels of every items especially food, begun to rise, people&#x27;s income level became stale and the Prime Minister herself warned of possible famine in the future and called for the general public to reduce their consumption, however did not say anything about politicians and government officials living luxurious lives. This cumulated to BNP staging massive protest on 24 December 2022, during clashes with the police one BNP activist was killed. Despite these criticisms the Awami League achieved numerous economic development in the nation, including the opening of the Padma Bridge and the Dhaka Metro Rail on 25 June 2022 and 28 December 2022 respectively. On 1 January 2024 the government came under international controversy and criticism after their involvement in Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus being convicted under labor law that was allegedly a false case.

Unlike the 2014 and 2018 general elections which were marred by violence, the 2024 Bangladeshi general election held on 7 January 2024 were generally peaceful and once again won by Awami League. The Awami League Government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took oath for a record fourth consecutive time on 10 January 2024. The election was boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Bangladesh was however grappled by large scale protests in July and August 2024 namely the 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement and the 2024 Non-cooperation movement and both protests were met by brutal resistance that resulted in hundreds of deaths across the whole country and the eventual resignation of the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League government on 5 August 2024, and Sheikh Hasina subsequently fled to India on the same day.

====2024–Present: Interim Government: Muhammad Yunus====

On 5 August 2024, following the fall of the previous government, the Army Chief Waker-uz-Zaman addressed the whole nation at 4 PM on the same day assuring the formation of an interim government within a few days. The interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as Chief Advisor was formed on 8 August 2024 through his oath of office. 16 advisors took oath under Yunus, they were:

*# Salehuddin Ahmed
*# Dr. Asif Nazrul
*# Adilur Rahman Khan
*# Hassan Ariff
*# Md. Touhid Hossain
*# Syeda Rizwana Hasan
*# Sharmeen S Murshid
*# Faruk-e-Azam
*# Brigadier General (Retired) M Sakhawat Hossain
*# Supradip Chakma
*# Bidhan Ranjan Roy
*# Dr. A F M Khalid Hossain
*# Farida Akhter
*# Nurjahan Begum
*# Md Nahid Islam
*# Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuiyan

Law adviser Dr. Asif Nazrul stated that the thirteenth general election may be possible by 2025. However he was contradicted by Religious Affairs Adviser AFM Khalid Hossain who said the date for the next general election has not yet been decided by the Interim Government. In January 2025 the Interim Government came under criticism for increasing VAT on numerous essential commodities amidst the country&#x27;s existing uncontrolled inflationary crisis.

<text>The economy of Bangladesh is a major developing mixed economy. As the second-largest economy in South Asia, Bangladesh&#x27;s economy is the 35th largest in the world in nominal terms, and 25th largest by purchasing power parity. Bangladesh is seen by various financial institutions as one of the Next Eleven. It has been transitioning from being a frontier market into an emerging market. Bangladesh is a member of the South Asian Free Trade Area and the World Trade Organization. In fiscal year 2021–2022, Bangladesh registered a GDP growth rate of 7.2% after the global pandemic. Bangladesh is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.

Industrialisation in Bangladesh received a strong impetus after the partition of India due to labour reforms and new industries. Between 1947 and 1971, East Bengal generated between 70% and 50% of Pakistan&#x27;s exports. Modern Bangladesh embarked on economic reforms in the late 1970s which promoted free markets and foreign direct investment. By the 1990s, the country had a booming ready-made garments industry. As of 16 March 2024, Bangladesh has the highest number of green garment factories in the world with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), where 80 are platinum-rated, 119 are gold-rated, 10 are silver, and four are without any rating. As of 6 March 2024, Bangladesh is home to 54 of the top 100 LEED Green Garment Factories globally, including 9 out of the top 10, and 18 out of the top 20. As of 27 April 2024, Bangladesh has a growing pharmaceutical industry with 12 percent average annual growth rate. Bangladesh is the only nation among the 48 least-developed countries that is almost self-sufficient when it comes to medicine production as local companies meet 98 percent of the domestic demand for pharmaceuticals. Remittances from the large Bangladeshi diaspora became a vital source of foreign exchange reserves. Agriculture in Bangladesh is supported by government subsidies and ensures self-sufficiency in food production. Bangladesh has pursued export-oriented industrialisation.

Bangladesh experienced robust growth after the pandemic with macroeconomic stability, improvements in infrastructure, a growing digital economy, and growing trade flows. Tax collection remains very low, with tax revenues accounting for only 7.7% of GDP. Bangladesh&#x27;s banking sector has a large amount of non-performing loans or loan defaults, which have caused a lot of concern. The private sector makes up 80% of GDP. The Dhaka Stock Exchange and Chittagong Stock Exchange are the two stock markets of the country. Most Bangladeshi businesses are privately owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) which make up 90% of all businesses.

==Economic history==
===Precolonial period===

Punch-marked coins are the earliest form of currency found in Bangladesh (Bengal region of Ancient India), dating back to the Iron Age and the first millennium BCE. 1st century Roman coins with images of Hercules have been excavated in Bangladesh and point to trade links with the Roman world. The Wari-Bateshwar ruins are believed to be the emporium (trading center) of Sounagoura mentioned by Roman geographer Claudius Ptolemy. The eastern segment of Bengal was a historically prosperous region. The Ganges Delta provided advantages of a mild, almost tropical climate, fertile soil, ample water, and an abundance of fish, wildlife, and fruit. Living standards for the elite were comparatively better than other parts of the Indian subcontinent. Trade routes like the Grand Trunk Road, Tea Horse Road and Silk Road connected the region to the wider neighborhood. Between 400 and 1200, the region had a well-developed economy in terms of land ownership, agriculture, livestock, shipping, trade, commerce, taxation, and banking. Muslim trade with Bengal increased after the fall of the Sasanian Empire and the Arab takeover of Persian trade routes. Much of this trade occurred east of the Meghna River in southeastern Bengal. After 1204, Muslim conquerors inherited the gold and silver reserves of pre-Islamic kingdoms.

The Bengal Sultanate presided over a mercantile empire of its own. Bengali ships were the largest ships in the Bay of Bengal and other parts of the Indian Ocean trade network. Ship-owning merchants often acted as royal envoys of the Sultan. A large number of wealthy Bengali merchants and shipowners lived in Malacca. A vessel from Bengal transported embassies from Brunei and Sumatra to China. Bengal and the Maldives operated the largest shell currency network in history. A Masai giraffe from Malindi in Africa was shipped to Bengal and later gifted to the Emperor of China as a gift from the Sultan of Bengal. The rulers of Arakan looked to Bengal for economic, political and cultural capital. The Sultan of Bengal financed projects in the Hejaz region of Arabia.

Under Mughal rule, Bengal operated as a centre of the worldwide muslin, silk and pearl trades. Domestically, much of India depended on Bengali products such as rice, silks and cotton textiles. Overseas, Europeans depended on Bengali products such as cotton textiles, silks and opium; Bengal accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia, for example. Bengal shipped saltpeter to Europe, sold opium in Indonesia, exported raw silk to Japan and the Netherlands, and produced cotton and silk textiles for export to Europe, Indonesia and Japan. Real wages and living standards in 18th-century Bengal were comparable to Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe.

During the Mughal era, the most important centre of cotton production was Bengal, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka, leading to muslin being called &quot;daka&quot; in distant markets such as Central Asia. Bengali agriculturalists rapidly learned techniques of mulberry cultivation and sericulture, establishing Bengal as a major silk-producing region of the world. Bengal accounted for more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks imported by the Dutch from Asia, for example.

Bengal also had a large shipbuilding industry. The shipbuilding output of Bengal during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was 223,250tons annually, compared with 23,061tons produced in nineteen colonies in North America from 1769 to 1771. The region was also a center of ship-repairing. Bengali shipbuilding was advanced compared to European shipbuilding at the time. An important innovation in shipbuilding was the introduction of a flushed deck design in Bengal rice ships, resulting in hulls that were stronger and less prone to leak than the structurally weak hulls of traditional European ships built with a stepped deck design. The English East India Company later duplicated the flushed-deck and hull designs of Bengal rice ships in the 1760s, leading to significant improvements in seaworthiness and navigation for European ships during the Industrial Revolution. Among the oldest businesses from the pre-colonial and Mughal periods, the biryani restaurant Fakhruddin&#x27;s traces its history to the era of the Nawabs of Bengal.

===Colonial period===

The British East India Company, that took complete control of Bengal in 1793 by abolishing Nizamat (local rule), chose to develop Calcutta, now the capital city of West Bengal, as their commercial and administrative center for the Company-held territories in South Asia. The development of East Bengal was thereafter limited to agriculture. The administrative infrastructure of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries focused on East Bengal&#x27;s function as a primarily agricultural producer—chiefly of rice, tea, teak, cotton, sugar cane and jute — for processors and traders in the British Empire. British rule saw the introduction of railways. The Hardinge Bridge was built to carry trains across the Padma River. In the early 20th century, Eastern Bengal and Assam was established in the British Raj to promote jobs, education and investment in East Bengal. In 1928, the Port of Chittagong was declared to be a &quot;Major Port&quot; of British India. East Bengal extended its rice economy into Arakan Division in British Burma. The river and sea ports of East Bengal, including Goalundo Ghat, the Port of Dhaka, the Port of Narayanganj, and the Port of Chittagong became entrepots for trade between Bengal, Assam and Burma. Some of Bangladesh&#x27;s venerable and oldest companies were born in British Bengal, including A K Khan &amp; Company, M. M. Ispahani Limited, James Finlay Bangladesh, and Anwar Group of Industries.

===Pakistan period===


The partition of India changed the economic geography of the region. The Pakistani government in East Bengal prioritized industries based on local raw materials like jute, cotton, and leather. The Korean War drove up demand for jute products. Adamjee Jute Mills, the world&#x27;s largest jute processing plant, was built in the Port of Narayanganj. The plant was a symbol of East Pakistan&#x27;s industrialization. Living standards began to gradually improve. Labor reforms in 1958 eventually benefitted a future independent Bangladesh to develop industry. Free market principles were generally accepted. The government promoted an industrial policy which aimed to produce consumer goods as quickly as possible in order to avoid dependence on imports. Certain sectors, like public utilities, fell under state ownership. Natural gas in Sylhet was discovered by the Burmah Oil Company in 1955. By the late 1960s, East Pakistan&#x27;s share of Pakistan&#x27;s exports went down from 70% to 50%. Pakistan&#x27;s rulers launched a so-called &quot;Decade of Development&quot; that &quot;resulted in numerous economic and social contradictions, which played themselves out, not just in the 1960s, but beyond, where Ayub Khan&#x27;s rule created the social and economic conditions leading to the separation of East Pakistan&quot;. According to the World Bank, economic discrimination against East Pakistan included diverting foreign aid and other funds to West Pakistan, the use of East Pakistan&#x27;s foreign-exchange surpluses to finance West Pakistani imports, and refusal by the central government to release funds allocated to East Pakistan. Rehman Sobhan paraphrased the Two-Nation Theory into the Two Economies Theory by arguing that East and West Pakistan diverged and became two different economies within one country.

===Post-independence period===
====Socialist era (1972–1975)====

After its independence from Pakistan, Bangladesh initially followed a socialist economy for five years, which proved to be a blunder by the Awami League government. The state nationalized all banks, insurance companies, and 580 industrial plants. Private companies had to operate under heavy regulation and restrictions. For example, profit limits were imposed on companies. Any company with revenues or profits above the limit were susceptible to nationalization. Many of the nationalized industries were abandoned by West Pakistanis during the war; while many pro-Awami League and other Bengali businesses also suffered nationalization of properties and industries. Land ownership was restricted to less than 25 &quot;bighas&quot;. Land owners with more than 25 &quot;bighas&quot; were subjected to taxes. Farmers had to sell their products at prices set by the government instead of the market. There was hardly any foreign investment. Since Bangladesh followed a socialist economy, it underwent a slow growth of producing experienced entrepreneurs, managers, administrators, engineers, and technicians. There were critical shortages of essential food grains and other staples because of wartime disruptions. External markets for jute had been lost because of the instability of supply and the increasing popularity of synthetic substitutes. Foreign exchange resources were minuscule, and the banking and monetary systems were unreliable. Although Bangladesh had a large work force, the vast reserves of under trained and underpaid workers were largely illiterate, unskilled, and underemployed. Commercially exploitable industrial resources, except for natural gas, were lacking. Inflation, especially for essential consumer goods, ran between 300 and 400 percent. The war of independence had crippled the transportation system. Hundreds of road and railroad bridges had been destroyed or damaged, and rolling stock was inadequate and in poor repair. The new country was still recovering from a severe cyclone that hit the area in 1970 and caused 250,000 deaths. India came forward immediately with critically measured economic assistance in the first months after Bangladesh achieved independence from Pakistan. Between December 1971 and January 1972, India committed US$232 million in aid to Bangladesh from the politico-economic aid India received from the US and USSR. The Awami League initiated work for the Ghorashal Fertilizer Factory and the Ashuganj Power Station. In spite of restrictions, several of Bangladesh&#x27;s leading companies in the future were founded during this period, including BEXIMCO and Advanced Chemical Industries.

====Military rule and economic reforms (1975–1990)====
After 1975 coups, new Bangladeshi military leaders began to promote private industry and turned their attention to developing new industrial capacity and rehabilitating the economy. The socialist economic model adopted by early leaders had resulted in inefficiency and economic stagnation. Beginning in late 1975, the government gradually gave greater scope to private sector participation in the economy, a pattern that has continued. The Dhaka Stock Exchange was re-opened in 1976. The government established special economic zones called Export Processing Zones (EPZs) to attract investors and promote export industries. These zones have played a key role in Bangladesh&#x27;s export economy. The government also de-nationalized and privatized state-owned industries by either returning them to their original owners or selling them to private buyers. Inefficiency in the public sector gradually increased; and left-wing opposition grew against the export of natural gas.

The 1980s saw the emergence of dynamic local brands like PRAN. Muhammad Yunus began experimenting with microcredit in the late 1970s. In 1983, the Grameen Bank was established. Bangladesh became the pioneer of the modern microcredit industry, with leading players like Grameen Bank, BRAC and Proshika. In the industrial sector, two policy innovations in the mid-1980s helped exporters. The reforms introduced the back-to-back letter of credit and duty-drawback facilities through bonded warehouses. These reforms removed major constraints for the country&#x27;s fledgling garment industry. The reforms allowed a garment manufacturer to obtain letters of credit from domestic banks to finance its import of inputs, by showing letters of credit from foreign buyers of garments. The reforms also reimbursed manufacturers the duty paid on imported inputs on proof that the inputs, stored in bonded warehouses, had been used to manufacture the exports. These reforms spurred the growth of industry into the world&#x27;s second largest textile exporting sector. In the mid-1980s, there were encouraging signs of progress. Economic policies aimed at encouraging private enterprise and investment, privatising public industries, reinstating budgetary discipline, and liberalising the import regime were accelerated. The International Finance Investment and Commerce Bank was set up as a multinational bank for Bangladesh, Nepal and the Maldives.

====Economic growth (1991–present)====

From 1991 to 1993, the government engaged in an enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A series of economic liberalization measures was introduced by finance minister Saifur Rahman, including opening up sectors like telecom to foreign investment. The Chittagong Stock Exchange was also set up. The 1990s was a boon for the private sector. Banking, telecommunications, aviation and tertiary education saw new private players and increased competition. The pharmaceutical industry in Bangladesh grew to meet 98% of domestic demand. The ceramics industry in Bangladesh developed to meet local demand for 96% of tableware ceramics, 77% of tiles and 89% of sanitary ceramics. The Chittagong-based steel industry in Bangladesh exploited scrap steel from ship-breaking yards and started contributing to shipbuilding in Bangladesh.

But the government failed to sustain reforms in large part because of preoccupation with the government&#x27;s domestic political troubles, including tensions between the Awami League, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jatiya Party. Frequent hartals and strikes disrupted the economy. In the late 1990s the government&#x27;s economic policies became more entrenched, and some gains were lost, which was highlighted by a precipitous drop in foreign direct investment in 2000 and 2001. Many new private commercial banks were given licenses to operate. Between 2001 and 2006, annual GDP growth touched an average of 5-6%. In June 2003 the IMF approved 3-year, $490-million plan as part of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for Bangladesh that aimed to support the government&#x27;s economic reform programme up to 2006. Seventy million dollars was made available immediately. In the same vein the World Bank approved $536 million in interest-free loans. The economy saw continuous real GDP growth of at least 6% since 2009. Bangladesh emerged as one of the fastest growing economies.

According to economist Syed Akhtar Mahmood, the Bangladeshi government is often seen as the villain in the country&#x27;s economic story. But government has played an important role in stimulating the economy through building infrastructure, liberalizing regulations, and promoting high yielding crops in agriculture. According to Mahmood, &quot;[m]ost roads linking the villages with one another, and with the cities, were not paved and not accessible throughout the year. This situation was remarkably transformed within a span of 10 years, from 1988 to 1997, with the construction of the so-called feeder roads. In 1988, Bangladesh had about 3,000 kilometers of feeder roads. By 1997, this network expanded to 15,500 kilometers. These &quot;last-mile&quot; all-weather roads helped connect the villages of Bangladesh to the rest of the country&quot;.

As a result of export-led growth, Bangladesh has enjoyed a trade surplus in recent years. Bangladesh historically has run a large trade deficit, financed largely through aid receipts and remittances from workers overseas. Foreign reserves dropped markedly in 2001 but stabilised in the US$3 to US$4 billion range (or about 3 months&#x27; import cover). In January 2007, reserves stood at $3.74 billion, and then increased to $5.8 billion by January 2008, in November 2009 it surpassed $10.0 billion, and as of April 2011 it surpassed the US$12 billion according to the Bank of Bangladesh, the central bank. The dependence on foreign aid and imports has also decreased gradually since the early 1990s. Foreign aid now accounts for only 2% of GDP.

In the last decade, poverty dropped by around one third with significant improvements in the human development index, literacy, life expectancy and per capita food consumption. With the economy growing annually at an average rate of 6% over a prolonged period, more than 15 million people have moved out of poverty since 1992. The poverty rate went down from 80% in 1971 to 44.2% in 1991 to 12.9% in 2021. In recent years, Bangladesh has focused on promoting regional trade and transport links. The Bangladesh Bhutan India Nepal Motor Vehicles Agreement seeks to create hassle free road transport across international borders. Bangladesh also signed a coastal shipping agreement with India. While prioritizing food security in the domestic market, Bangladesh exports more than US$1 billion worth of processed food products. As the result of a robust agricultural supply chain, supermarkets have sprung up in cities and towns across the country.

Bangladesh became the second largest textile exporter in the world. An estimated 4.4 million workers are employed in the garments industry, with the majority being women. The sector contributes 11% of Bangladesh&#x27;s GDP. The 2013 Rana Plaza factory collapse caused global concern on industrial safety in Bangladesh, leading to the formation of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety. The local clothing industry has seen fiercely competitive brands vying for the market, including Aarong, Westecs, Ecstasy, and Yellow among many others.

The World Bank notes the economic progress of the country by stating that &quot;[w]hen the newly independent country of Bangladesh was born on December 16, 1971, it was the second poorest country in the world—making the country&#x27;s transformation over the next 50 years one of the great development stories. Since then, poverty has been cut in half at record speed. Enrolment in primary school is now nearly universal. Hundreds of thousands of women have entered the workforce. Steady progress has been made on maternal and child health. And the country is better buttressed against the destructive forces posed by climate change and natural disasters. Bangladesh&#x27;s success comprises many moving parts—from investing in human capital to establishing macroeconomic stability. Building on this success, the country is now setting the stage for further economic growth and job creation by ramping up investments in energy, inland connectivity, urban projects, and transport infrastructure, as well as prioritizing climate change adaptation and disaster preparedness on its path toward sustainable growth&quot;.

As of 2022, Bangladesh had the second largest foreign-exchange reserves in South Asia. In 2021, Bangladesh surpassed both India and Pakistan in terms of per capita income. The country achieved 100% electricity coverage for households in 2022. Megaprojects like the Padma Bridge, Dhaka Metro, Matarbari Port, and Karnaphuli Tunnel have been planned to stimulate economic activity. The completion of Padma Bridge was expected to boost Bangladeshi GDP by 1.23%. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Bangladesh experienced pressure on its foreign exchange reserves due to rising import costs; this affected the country&#x27;s electricity sector which relies on imported fuel; rising import prices also contributed to inflation.

==Economic sectors==
===Agriculture===
===Manufacturing and industry===
Many new jobs – mostly for women – have been created by the country&#x27;s dynamic private ready-made garment industry, which grew at double-digit rates through most of the 1990s. By the late 1990s, about 1.5 million people, mostly women, were employed in the garments sector as well as Leather products specially Footwear (Shoe manufacturing unit). During 2001–2002, export earnings from ready-made garments reached $3,125 million, representing 52% of Bangladesh&#x27;s total exports. Bangladesh has overtaken India in apparel exports in 2009, its exports stood at 2.66 billion US dollar, ahead of India&#x27;s 2.27 billion US dollar and in 2014 the export rose to $3.12 billion every month. At the fiscal year 2018, Bangladesh has been able to garner US$36.67 billion export earnings by exporting manufactured goods, of which, 83.49 percent has come from the apparel manufacturing sector.

Eastern Bengal was known for its fine muslin and silk fabric before the British period. The dyes, yarn, and cloth were the envy of much of the premodern world. Bengali muslin, silk, and brocade were worn by the aristocracy of Asia and Europe. The introduction of machine-made textiles from England in the late eighteenth century spelled doom for the costly and time-consuming hand loom process. Cotton growing died out in East Bengal, and the textile industry became dependent on imported yarn. Those who had earned their living in the textile industry were forced to rely more completely on farming. Only the smallest vestiges of a once-thriving cottage industry survived.

Other industries which have shown very strong growth include the pharmaceutical industry, shipbuilding industry, information technology, leather industry, steel industry, and light engineering industry.

Bangladesh has a robust pharmaceutical industry. As of 27 April 2024, Bangladesh is the only nation among the 48 least-developed countries that is almost self-sufficient when it comes to medicine production as local companies meet 98 percent of the demand while 213 pharmaceutical companies are operating in Bangladesh and the industry clocks an average annual growth rate of 12 percent. Nine drug manufacturers have received approvals from regulators in the United States, the European Union, and Australia as well as from the World Health Organisation. The sector ships products to around 150 countries.

Bangladesh&#x27;s textile industry, which includes knitwear and ready-made garments (RMG) along with specialised textile products, is the nation&#x27;s number one export earner, accounting for $21.5 billion in 2013 – 80% of Bangladesh&#x27;s total exports of $27 billion.
Bangladesh is 2nd in world textile exports, behind China, which exported $120.1 billion worth of textiles in 2009. The industry employs nearly 3.5 million workers. Current exports have doubled since 2004. Wages in Bangladesh&#x27;s textile industry were the lowest in the world as of 2010. The country was considered the most formidable rival to China where wages were rapidly rising and currency was appreciating. As of 2012 wages remained low for the 3 million people employed in the industry, but labour unrest was increasing despite vigorous government action to enforce labour peace. Owners of textile firms and their political allies were a powerful political influence in Bangladesh.
The urban garment industry has created more than one million formal sector jobs for women, contributing to the high female labour participation in Bangladesh. While it can be argued that women working in the garment industry are subjected to unsafe labour conditions and low wages, Dina M. Siddiqi argues that even though conditions in Bangladesh garment factories &quot;are by no means ideal,&quot; they still give women in Bangladesh the opportunity to earn their own wages. As evidence she points to the fear created by the passage of the 1993 Harkins Bill (Child Labor Deterrence Bill), which caused factory owners to dismiss &quot;an estimated 50,000 children, many of whom helped support their families, forcing them into a completely unregulated informal sector, in lower-paying and much less secure occupations such as brick-breaking, domestic service and rickshaw pulling.&quot;

Even though the working conditions in garment factories are not ideal, they tend to financially be more reliable than other occupations and, &quot;enhance women&#x27;s economic capabilities to spend, save and invest their incomes.&quot; Both married and unmarried women send money back to their families as remittances, but these earned wages have more than just economic benefits. Many women in the garment industry are marrying later, have lower fertility rates, and attain higher levels of education, then women employed elsewhere.

After massive labour unrest in 2006 the government formed a Minimum Wage Board including business and worker representatives which in 2006 set a minimum wage equivalent to 1,662.50 taka, $24 a month, up from Tk950. In 2010, following widespread labour protests involving 60,000 workers in June 2010, a controversial proposal was being considered by the Board which would raise the monthly minimum to the equivalent of $50 a month, still far below worker demands of 5,000 taka, $72, for entry level wages, but unacceptably high according to textile manufacturers who are asking for a wage below $30. On 28 July 2010 it was announced that the minimum entry level wage would be increased to 3,000 taka, about $43.

The government also seems to believe some change is necessary. On 21 September 2006 then ex-Prime Minister Khaleda Zia called on textile firms to ensure the safety of workers by complying with international labour law at a speech inaugurating the Bangladesh Apparel &amp; Textile Exposition (BATEXPO).

Many Western multinationals use labour in Bangladesh, which is one of the cheapest in the world: 30 euros per month compared to 150 or 200 in China. Four days is enough for the CEO of one of the top five global textile brands to earn what a Bangladeshi garment worker will earn in her lifetime. In April 2013, at least 1,135 textile workers died in the collapse of their factory. Other fatal accidents due to unsanitary factories have affected Bangladesh: in 2005 a factory collapsed and caused the death of 64 people. In 2006, a series of fires killed 85 people and injured 207 others. In 2010, some 30 people died of asphyxiation and burns in two serious fires.

In 2006, tens of thousands of workers mobilized in one of the country&#x27;s largest strike movements, affecting almost all of the 4,000 factories. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) uses police forces to crack down. Three workers were killed, hundreds more were wounded by bullets, or imprisoned. In 2010, after a new strike movement, nearly 1,000 people were injured among workers as a result of the repression.

===Shipbuilding and shipbreaking===
Shipbuilding is a growing industry in Bangladesh with great potential. Due to the potential of shipbuilding in Bangladesh, the country has been compared to countries like China, Japan and South Korea. Referring to the growing amount of export deals secured by the shipbuilding companies as well as the low cost labour available in the country, experts suggest that Bangladesh could emerge as a major competitor in the global market of small to medium ocean-going vessels.

Bangladesh also has the world&#x27;s largest ship breaking industry which employs over 200,000 Bangladeshis and accounts for half of all the steel in Bangladesh. Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard is the world&#x27;s second-largest ship breaking area.

Khulna Shipyard Limited (KSY) with over five decades of reputation has been leading the Bangladesh Shipbuilding industry and had built a wide spectrum of ships for domestic and international clients. KSY built ships for Bangladesh Navy, Bangladesh Army and Bangladesh Coast Guard under the contract of ministry of defence.

===Finance===

Most banks in Bangladesh are privately owned. Until the 1980s, the financial sector of Bangladesh was dominated by state-owned banks. With the grand-scale reform made in finance, private commercial banks were established through privatisation. The next finance sector reform programme was launched from 2000 to 2006 with focus on the development of financial institutions and adoption of risk-based regulations and supervision by Bangladesh Bank. As of date, the banking sector consisted of 4 SCBs, 4 government-owned specialized banks dealing in development financing, 39 private commercial banks, and 9 foreign commercial banks.

===Tourism===

The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported in 2013 that the travel and tourism industry in Bangladesh directly generated 1,281,500 jobs in 2012 or 1.8 percent of the country&#x27;s total employment, which ranked Bangladesh 157 out of 178 countries worldwide. Direct and indirect employment in the industry totalled 2,714,500 jobs, or 3.7 percent of the country&#x27;s total employment. The WTTC predicted that by 2023, travel and tourism will directly generate 1,785,000 jobs and support an overall total of 3,891,000 jobs, or 4.2 percent of the country&#x27;s total employment. This would represent an annual growth rate in direct jobs of 2.9 percent. Domestic spending generated 97.7 percent of direct travel and tourism gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012. Bangladesh&#x27;s world ranking in 2012 for travel and tourism&#x27;s direct contribution to GDP, as a percentage of GDP, was 142 out of 176.

in 2014 125,000 tourists visited Bangladesh. This number is extremely low relative to total population. As of 22 May 2019 the total local population numbering 166,594,000 inhabitants. This gives a ratio of 1 tourist for every 1,333 locals.

===Information and communication technology===
Bangladesh&#x27;s information technology sector is a sector that has seen much growth in the past three years. Bangladesh has 80 million internet users, an estimated 9% growth in internet use by June 2017 powered by mobile internet. Bangladesh currently has an active 23 million
Facebook users. Bangladesh currently has 143.1 million mobile phone customers.
Bangladesh exported $800 million worth of software, games, outsourcing and services to European countries, the United States, Canada, Russia and India by 30 June 2017.

==Investment==

The stock market capitalisation of the Dhaka Stock Exchange in Bangladesh crossed $10 billion in November 2007 and the $30 billion mark in 2009, and US$50 billion in August 2010. Bangladesh had the best performing stock market in Asia during the recent global recession between 2007 and 2010, due to relatively low correlations with developed country stock markets.

Major investment in real estate by domestic and foreign-resident Bangladeshis has led to a massive building boom in Dhaka and Chittagong.

Recent (2011) trends for investing in Bangladesh as Saudi Arabia trying to secure public and private investment in oil and gas, power and transportation projects, United Arab Emirates (UAE) is keen to invest in growing shipbuilding industry in Bangladesh encouraged by comparative cost advantage, Tata, an India-based leading industrial multinational to invest Taka 1500 crore to set up an automobile industry in Bangladesh, World Bank to invest in rural roads improving quality of live, the Rwandan entrepreneurs are keen to invest in Bangladesh&#x27;s pharmaceuticals sector considering its potentiality in international market, Samsung sought to lease 500 industrial plots from the export zones authority to set up an electronics hub in Bangladesh with an investment of US$1.25 billion, National Board of Revenue (NBR) is set to withdraw tax rebate facilities on investment in the capital market by individual taxpayers from the fiscal 2011–12. In 2011, Japan Bank for International Cooperation ranked Bangladesh as the 15th best investment destination for foreign investors.

===2010–11 market crash===

The bullish capital market turned bearish during 2010, with the exchange losing 1,800 points between December 2010 and January 2011. Millions of investors have been rendered bankrupt as a result of the market crash. The crash is believed to be caused artificially to benefit a handful of players at the expense of the big players.

===Companies===

The list includes ten largest Bangladeshi companies by trading value (millions in BDT) in 2018.

===Composition of economic sectors===

The Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) has predicted textile exports will rise from US$7.90 billion earned in 2005–06 to US$15
billion by 2011. In part this optimism stems from how well the sector has fared since the end of textile and clothing quotas, under the Multifibre Agreement, in early 2005.

According to a United Nations Development Programme report &quot;Sewing Thoughts: How to Realize Human Development Gains in the Post-Quota World&quot; Bangladesh has been able to offset a decline in European sales by cultivating new markets in the United States.

&quot;[In 2005] we had tremendous growth. The quota-free textile regime has proved to be a big boost for our factories,&quot; said BGMEA president S.M. Fazlul Hoque told reporters, after the
sector&#x27;s 24 per cent growth rate was revealed.

The Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) president Md Fazlul Hoque has also struck an optimistic tone. In an interview with United News Bangladesh he lauded the blistering growth rate, saying &quot;The quality of our products and its competitiveness in terms of prices helped the sector achieve such... tremendous success.&quot;

Knitwear posted the strongest growth of all textile products in 2005–06, surging 35.38 per cent to US$2.82 billion. On the downside however, the sector&#x27;s strong growth came amid sharp falls in prices for textile products on the world market, with growth subsequently dependent upon large increases in volume.

Bangladesh&#x27;s quest to boost the quantity of textile trade was also helped by US and EU caps on Chinese textiles. The US cap restricts growth in imports of Chinese textiles to 12.5 per cent next year and between 15 and 16 per cent in 2008. The EU deal similarly manages import growth until 2008.

Bangladesh may continue to benefit from these restrictions over the next two years, however a climate of falling global textile prices forces wage rates the centre of the nation&#x27;s efforts to increase market share.

They offer a range of incentives to potential investors including 10-year tax holidays, duty-free import of capital goods, raw materials and building materials, exemptions on income tax on salaries paid to foreign nationals for three years and dividend tax exemptions for the period of the tax holiday.

All goods produced in the zones are able to be exported duty-free, in addition to which Bangladesh benefits from the Generalised System of Preferences in US, European and Japanese markets and is also endowed with Most Favoured Nation status from the United States.

Furthermore, Bangladesh imposes no ceiling on investment in the EPZs and allows full repatriation of profits.

The formation of labour unions within the EPZs is prohibited as are strikes.

Bangladesh has been a world leader in its efforts to end the use of child labour in garment factories. On 4 July 1995, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, International Labour Organization, and UNICEF signed a memorandum of understanding on the elimination of child labour in the garment sector. Implementation of this pioneering agreement began in fall 1995, and by the end of 1999, child labour in the garment trade virtually had been eliminated. The labour-intensive process of ship breaking for scrap has developed to the point where it now meets most of Bangladesh&#x27;s domestic steel needs. Other industries include sugar, tea, leather goods, newsprint, pharmaceutical, and fertilizer production.

The Bangladesh government continues to court foreign investment, something it has done fairly successfully in private power generation and gas exploration and production, as well as in other sectors such as cellular telephony, textiles, and pharmaceuticals. In 1989, the same year it signed a bilateral investment treaty with the United States, it established a Board of Investment to simplify approval and start-up procedures for foreign investors, although in practice the board has done little to increase investment. The government created the Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority to manage the various export processing zones. The agency currently manages EPZs in Adamjee, Chittagong, Comilla, Dhaka, Ishwardi, Karnaphuli, Mongla, and Uttara. An EPZ has also been proposed for Sylhet. The government has given the private sector permission to build and operate competing EPZs-initial construction on a Korean EPZ started in 1999. In June 1999, the AFL–CIO petitioned the U.S. Government to deny Bangladesh access to U.S. markets under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), citing the country&#x27;s failure to meet promises made in 1992 to allow freedom of association in EPZs.

==International trade==

Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on almost all sectors of the economy, inter alia, most notably, it has caused a reduction of exports by 16.93 percent, and imports by 17 percent in the FY2019-20.

In 2015, the top exports of Bangladesh are Non-Knit Men&#x27;s Suits ($5.6B), Knit T-shirts ($5.28B), Knit Sweaters ($4.12B), Non-Knit Women&#x27;s Suits ($3.66B) and Non-Knit Men&#x27;s Shirts ($2.52B). In 2015, the top imports of Bangladesh are Heavy Pure Woven Cotton ($1.33B), Refined Petroleum ($1.25B), Light Pure Woven Cotton ($1.12B), Raw Cotton ($1.01B) and Wheat ($900M).

In 2015, the top export destinations of Bangladesh are the United States ($6.19B), Germany ($5.17B), the United Kingdom ($3.53B), France ($2.37B) and Spain ($2.29B). In 2015, the top import origins are China ($13.9B), India ($5.51B), Singapore ($2.22B), Hong Kong ($1.47B) and Japan ($1.36B).

==Bangladeshi women and the economy==
As of 2014, female participation in the labour force is 58 percent as per World Bank data, and male participation at 82 percent. Through the efforts of government and non-governmental organizations like CARE International, the participation of women in the Bangladeshi politics and the economy has improved drastically.

A 2007 World Bank report stated that the areas in which women&#x27;s work force participation have increased the most are in the fields of agriculture, education and health and social work. Over three-quarters of women in the labour force work in the agricultural sector. On the other hand, the International Labour Organization reports that women&#x27;s workforce participation has only increased in the professional and administrative areas between 2000 and 2005, demonstrating women&#x27;s increased participation in sectors that require higher education. Employment and labour force participation data from the World Bank, the UN, and the ILO vary and often under report on women&#x27;s work due to unpaid labour and informal sector jobs. Though these fields are mostly paid, women experience very different work conditions than men, including wage differences and work benefits. Women&#x27;s wages are significantly lower than men&#x27;s wages for the same job with women being paid as much as 60–75 percent less than what men make.

One example of action that is being taken to improve female conditions in the work force is Non-Governmental Organisations. These NGOs encourage women to rely on their own self-savings, rather than external funds provide women with increased decision-making and participation within the family and society. However, some NGOs that address microeconomic issues among individual families fail to deal with broader macroeconomic issues that prevent women&#x27;s complete autonomy and advancement.

==Historical statistics==
Bangladesh has made significant strides in its economic sector performance since independence in 1971. Although the economy has improved vastly in the 1990s, Bangladesh still suffers in the area of foreign trade in South Asian. Despite major impediments to growth like the inefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly growing labour force that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, inadequate power supplies, and slow implementation of economic reforms, Bangladesh has made some headway improving the climate for foreign investors and liberalising the capital markets; for example, it has negotiated with foreign firms for oil and gas exploration, bettered the countrywide distribution of cooking gas, and initiated the construction of natural gas pipelines and power stations. Progress on other economic reforms has been halting because of opposition from the bureaucracy, public sector unions, and other vested interest groups.

The especially severe floods of 1998 increased the flow of international aid. So far the global financial crisis has not had a major impact on the economy. Foreign aid has seen a gradual decline over the last few decades but economists see this as a good sign for self-reliance. There has been a dramatic growth in exports and remittance inflow which has helped the economy to expand at a steady rate. Bangladesh&#x27;s GDP is expected to grow at 5.3 percent in 2023 and 6.5 percent in 2024 according to the latest ADB report.

Bangladesh has been on the list of UN Least Developed Countries (LDC) since 1975. Bangladesh met the requirements to be recognised as a developing country in March 2018 with Bangladesh&#x27;s Gross National Income (GNI) US$1,724 per capita, the Human Assets Index (HAI) 72 and the Economic Vulnerability (EVI) Index 25.2 then. Bangladesh&#x27;s GNI is now forecasted to reach at US$4,753.39 in 2030.

<text>Hermes Trismegistus (from , &quot;Hermes the Thrice-Greatest&quot;) is a legendary Hellenistic period figure that originated as a syncretic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. He is the purported author of the &quot;Hermetica&quot;, a widely diverse series of ancient and medieval pseudepigraphica that laid the basis of various philosophical systems known as Hermeticism.

The wisdom attributed to this figure in antiquity combined a knowledge of both the material and the spiritual world, which rendered the writings attributed to him of great relevance to those who were interested in the interrelationship between the material and the divine.

The figure of Hermes Trismegistus can also be found in both Muslim and Baháʼí writings. In those traditions, Hermes Trismegistus has been associated with the prophet Idris (the Biblical Enoch).

==Origin and identity==

Hermes Trismegistus may be associated with the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. Greeks in the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt recognized the equivalence of Hermes and Thoth through the . Consequently, the two gods were worshiped as one, in what had been the Temple of Thoth in Khemenu, which was known in the Hellenistic period as Hermopolis.

Hermes, the Greek god of interpretive communication, was combined with Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom. The Egyptian priest and polymath Imhotep had been deified long after his death and therefore assimilated to Thoth in the classical and Hellenistic periods. The renowned scribe Amenhotep and a wise man named Teôs were coequal deities of wisdom, science, and medicine; and, thus, they were placed alongside Imhotep in shrines dedicated to Thoth–Hermes during the Ptolemaic Kingdom.

Cicero enumerates several deities referred to as &quot;Hermes&quot;: a &quot;fourth Mercury (Hermes) was the son of the Nile, whose name may not be spoken by the Egyptians&quot;; and &quot;the fifth, who is worshiped by the people of Pheneus [in Arcadia], is said to have killed Argus Panoptes, and for this reason to have fled to Egypt, and to have given the Egyptians their laws and alphabet: he it is whom the Egyptians call Theyt&quot;. The most likely interpretation of this passage is as two variants on the same syncretism of Greek Hermes and Egyptian Thoth (or sometimes other gods): the fourth (where Hermes turns out &quot;actually&quot; to have been a &quot;son of the Nile,&quot; i.e. a native god) being viewed from the Egyptian perspective, the fifth (who went from Greece to Egypt) being viewed from the Greek-Arcadian perspective. Both of these early references in Cicero (most ancient Trismegistus material is from the early centuries AD) corroborate the view that Thrice-Great Hermes originated in Hellenistic Egypt through syncretism between Greek and Egyptian gods (the &quot;Hermetica&quot; refer most often to Thoth and Amun).

The Hermetic literature among the Egyptians, which was concerned with conjuring spirits and animating statues, inform the oldest Hellenistic writings on Greco-Babylonian astrology and on the newly developed practice of alchemy. In a parallel tradition, Hermetic philosophy rationalized and systematized religious cult practices and offered the adept a means of personal ascension from the constraints of physical being. This latter tradition has led to the confusion of Hermeticism with Gnosticism, which was developing contemporaneously.

==The epithet &quot;thrice great&quot;==
Fowden asserts that the first datable occurrences of the epithet &quot;thrice great&quot; are in the &quot;Legatio&quot; of Athenagoras of Athens and in a fragment from Philo of Byblos, –141. However, in a later work, Copenhaver reports that this epithet is first found in the minutes of a meeting of the council of the Ibis cult, held in 172 BC near Memphis in Egypt. Hart explains that the epithet is derived from an epithet of Thoth found at the Temple of Esna, &quot;Thoth the great, the great, the great.&quot;

Many Christian writers, including Lactantius, Augustine, Marsilio Ficino, Campanella, and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, as well as Giordano Bruno, considered Hermes Trismegistus to be a wise pagan prophet who foresaw the coming of Christianity. They believed in the existence of a &quot;prisca theologia&quot;, a single, true theology that threads through all religions. It was given by God to man in antiquity and passed through a series of prophets, which included Zoroaster and Plato. In order to demonstrate the verity of the &quot;prisca theologia,&quot; Christians appropriated the Hermetic teachings for their own purposes. By this account, Hermes Trismegistus was either a contemporary of Moses, or the third in a line of men named Hermes, i.e. Enoch, Noah, and the Egyptian priest king who is known to us as Hermes Trismegistus on account of being the greatest priest, philosopher, and king.

Another explanation, in the &quot;Suda&quot; (10th century), is that &quot;He was called Trismegistus on account of his praise of the trinity, saying there is one divine nature in the trinity.&quot;

==Hermetic writings==

During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the &quot;Hermetica&quot; enjoyed great prestige and were popular among alchemists. Hermes was also strongly associated with astrology, for example by the influential Islamic astrologer Abu Ma&#x27;shar al-Balkhi (787–886). The &quot;Hermetic tradition&quot; consequently refers to alchemy, magic, astrology, and related subjects. The texts are usually divided into two categories: the philosophical and the technical hermetica. The former deals mainly with philosophy, and the latter with practical magic, potions, and alchemy. The expression &quot;hermetically sealed&quot; comes from the alchemical procedure to make the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. This required a mixture of materials to be placed in a glass vessel which was sealed by fusing the neck closed, a procedure known as the Seal of Hermes. The vessel was then heated for 30 to 40 days.

During the Renaissance, it was accepted that Hermes Trismegistus was a contemporary of Moses. However, after Isaac Casaubon&#x27;s demonstration in 1614 that the Hermetic writings must postdate the advent of Christianity, the whole of Renaissance Hermeticism collapsed. As to their actual authorship:

The French figurist Jesuit missionary to China Joachim Bouvet thought that Hermes Trismegistus, Zoroaster and the Chinese cultural hero Fuxi were actually the Biblical patriarch Enoch.

Various critical editions of the Hermetica have been published in modern academia, such as &quot;Hermetica&quot; by Brian Copenhaver.

==Islamic tradition==


Antoine Faivre, in &quot;The Eternal Hermes&quot; (1995), has pointed out that Hermes Trismegistus has a place in the Islamic tradition, although the name Hermes does not appear in the Qur&#x27;an. Hagiographers and chroniclers of the first centuries of the Islamic Hijrah quickly identified Hermes Trismegistus with Idris, the Islamic prophet of surahs 19.57 and 21.85, whom Muslims also identified with Enoch (cf. Genesis 5.18–24). According to the account of the Persian astrologer Abu Ma&#x27;shar al-Balkhi (787–886), Idris/Hermes was termed &quot;Thrice-Wise&quot; Hermes Trismegistus because he had a threefold origin. The first Hermes, comparable to Thoth, was a &quot;civilizing hero&quot;, an initiator into the mysteries of the divine science and wisdom that animate the world; he carved the principles of this sacred science in hieroglyphs. The second Hermes, in Babylon, was the initiator of Pythagoras. The third Hermes was the first teacher of alchemy. &quot;A faceless prophet,&quot; writes the Islamicist Pierre Lory, &quot;Hermes possesses no concrete or salient characteristics, differing in this regard from most of the major figures of the Bible and the Quran.&quot;

The star-worshipping sect known as the Sabians of Harran also believed that their doctrine descended from Hermes Trismegistus.

There are least twenty Arabic &quot;Hermetica&quot; extant. While some of these Arabic Hermetic writings were translated from Greek or Middle-Persian, some were originally written in Arabic. Hermetic fragments are also found in the works of Muslim alchemists such as Jabir ibn Hayyan (died –816, cited an early version of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; in his ) and Ibn Umayl (, quoted and commented upon Hermetic sayings throughout his work, among them also a commentary on the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot;).

==Baháʼí writings==
Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, founder of the Baháʼí Faith, identifies Idris with Hermes in his &quot;Tablet on the Uncompounded Reality&quot;.

== Structure ==

As defined in the National Telecommunications Policy 1998 and International Long-Distance Telecommunications Services (ILDTS) Policy 2007, all mobile operators are to interconnect through Interconnection Exchange (ICX) and all international calls to be handled by International Gateway (IGW) which is to be connected to the mobile and fixed operators through the ICXs.

The Interconnection Exchange (ICX) will receive all calls from the mobile and fixed operators whenever the call is made to another network and will pass it to the destination network if the call is local, and will pass to the IGWs if the call is international. ICX will also deliver calls received from IGWs where the call is destined.

Below illustrate the structure of interconnection between different interfaces.

==Radio==

Radio broadcast stations: AM 12, FM 12, shortwave 2, community radio 1, Internet radios

Radios: 6.15 million (1997)

The government-owned Betar-Radio Bangladesh operates from Dhaka and other local districts. Currently, private FM radio channels are very popular. They are trying to attract young people by broadcasting music and news. The operating private radio channels include:
*dhakaFM 90.4 FM
*Radio Amber 102.4 FM
*Radio Today 89.6 FM
*Radio Foorti 88.0 FM
*Radio Amar 88.4 FM
*ABC Radio 89.2 FM
*Peoples Radio 91.6 FM

==Television==

As of 2012, there are 23 broadcast television stations in Bangladesh, including the state-run BTV and BTV World, with 20 million television sets in the country.

The number of private satellite channels are growing. The first private channel in Bangladesh was ATN Bangla. There are 8 full-fledged news channels (ATN News, Channel 24, DBC News, Ekattor, Independent Television, Jamuna Television, News24 and Somoy TV).

==Internet==

Bangladesh first received Internet access in 1996. In the recent years, Internet usage has rapidly increased. The Bangladesh government imposes a high Internet tariff, stunting the sector&#x27;s growth, claims Norwegian-owned Telenor. Due to controversy, the Bangladesh government decided to reduce the tariff by 50%.

The Bangladesh&#x27;s Internet country code is .bd.

As of 2005, more than 180 Internet Service Providers are operating in the country. ISPs are regulated by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC).

In April 2010, Akhtaruzzaman Manju, president of the Internet Service Providers&#x27; Association of Bangladesh, told Xinhua that the country&#x27;s six mobile phone operators and Internet Service Providers have so far provided over 800,000 Internet connections. &quot;We&#x27;ve estimated that nearly 10 million people in the country are using 800,000 internet connections on a shared basis,&quot; he said, adding the number of Internet users in the country is increasing yearly by around 15-16 percent.

A 2009 study by the Boston Consulting Group found that the number of Internet subscribers in Bangladesh is likely to reach 18.3 million by 2020, equivalent to a 32 percent household Internet penetration, which will result in a 2.6 percent contribution to the country&#x27;s GDP while creating 129,000 more jobs, the research added.

===Broadband Internet access===
Though broadband Internet access is available, the cost of high-speed connection is higher than in other south Asian countries. Broadband Internet and e-commerce in Bangladesh is progressing slowly. WiMAX service is now available from some Internet service providers. In Bangladesh broadband is legally defined as 128/128 kbit/s, which is not in line with ITU standards.

The ISPs currently providing broadband services in Bangladesh are:
* Banglalion
* Infocom Limited
* InfoLink

==Satellite==
There are six satellite Earth stations, including Talimabad, and Betbunia. Bangladesh sent its first satellite, Bangabandhu-1, into space on May 11, 2018.

==Submarine cables==
Bangladesh is connected to SEA-ME-WE 4 or SMW-4 (South-East Asia – Middle East – Western Europe 4) and SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable systems. The landing site of the SMW-4 Bangladesh branch is located in Cox&#x27;s Bazar and the landing site of the SMW-5 Bangladesh branch is located in Kuakata. The two submarine cables provide the country with redundancy to support uninterrupted Internet and long-distance communications and also with a huge bandwidth. Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Limited is the only submarine cable operator in Bangladesh.

<text>Transport in Bangladesh is dominated by roadways, accounting for the majority of both passenger and cargo traffic due to substantial development efforts since independence. Eight major national highways connect the capital, Dhaka, with divisional and district headquarters, port cities, and international routes. Despite this, vehicle usage per capita remains low, with non-motorised modes prevailing. However, Bangladesh&#x27;s roads are unsafe, having one of the highest road accident fatality rates. They also suffer from high congestion, as well as severe air and noise pollution.

The share of railway traffic has seen a significant decline since 1975, facing challenges like shortage of rolling stock and poor track conditions. Transportation through inland waterways, though also declining, remains popular thanks to Bangladesh&#x27;s extensive river network and the use of ferries.

Air travel in Bangladesh is supported by three international and five domestic airports, of which Hazrat Shahjalal is the largest and busiest. Biman Bangladesh, the national airline, and the privately-owned US-Bangla are the two international carriers based in Bangladesh, which also operate domestic flights to these airports alongside three other private airlines.

In 2023, Bangladesh ranked 88 in the Logistics Performance Index among 139 countries and third among South Asian countries, after India and Sri Lanka.

== Road ==

With around of roads, Bangladesh ranks 16th in the world for total length of road network. It has the highest road density in South Asia after India and ranks 13th globally. However, only about 30 per cent, or , of these roads are paved. The network maintained by the Roads and Highways Departmentthe government agency responsible for the construction and upkeep of the country&#x27;s major road and bridge networkincludes approximately of national highways, of regional highways, and of district (&quot;zila&quot;) roads.

=== Highways ===
There are eight major national highways, linking the capital with various divisional and district headquarters, port cities, and international routes. The Dhaka–Chittagong highway (N1) is regarded as the lifeline of the country’s trade and commerce, connecting the capital, Dhaka, with the primary port city of Chittagong. The Dhaka–Mawa–Bhanga Expressway, opened in 2020, is the first controlled-access highway in the country.

Three Asian Highway routes pass through Bangladesh, with parts of the network undergoing upgrades to meet international standards. The routes are:

* AH1: Tamabil to Benapole (), connecting to India at both ends.
* AH2: Tamabil to Banglabandha (), also connecting to India at both ends.
* AH41: Teknaf to Mongla (), with potential for extension to Myanmar.

=== Usage ===
Although road transport usage has risen significantly compared to rail and inland waterways since 1975, the rate of vehicle usage remains notably low, with only 7.89 vehicles and 4.22 passenger cars per 1,000 people. There are nearly 4.3 million motorcycles, 714 thousand passenger cars, and 86.5 thousand buses, collectively covering 140.7 billion passenger-kilometres in 2021, and accounting for 88 per cent of passenger traffic in 2005. This marks a significant increase from the 9.2 billion passenger-kilometres recorded in 1975, which accounted for 54 per cent of passenger traffic. Additionally, approximately 535,000 vans, pickups, lorries, and tractors are actively used, transporting 80 per cent of cargo in 2005 and covering 137.2 billion tonne-kilometres in 2021, a sharp increase from 900 million tonne-kilometres, comprising 35 per cent of cargo traffic, in 1975.

Despite significant growth in the number of motor vehicles, Bangladesh&#x27;s transportation demand continues to be predominantly met by non-motorised modes, especially walking and rickshaws. The level of motorisation in the country remains considerably lower compared to many other nations.

=== Issues ===

==== Safety ====
Bangladesh has one of the highest road accident fatality rates globally, with estimates from non-governmental sources reaching as high as 25,000 deaths in 2019, although official government figures are much lower. The annual road crash deaths per capita in Bangladesh are twice the average rate for high-income countries and five times that of the best-performing countries worldwide. Buses and trucks are identified as the primary contributors to traffic accidents, with pedestrian casualties being particularly common. Major contributing factors include a mix of diverse traffic, inadequate enforcement of laws, poor road conditions, and a lack of formal training and education.

Road safety concerns have sparked significant movements, such as Nirapad Sarak Chai, and mass protests, primarily led by students. A notable instance was the major 2018 road safety protests, when tens of thousands of schoolchildren in Dhaka and nearby cities protested following the deaths of two students caused by a speeding bus. In response to these events, the government passed the Road Transport Act in September 2018, despite opposition from transport workers. The act aimed to enhance road safety by increasing fines for traffic violations, imposing stricter licensing requirements, and introducing harsher penalties, including the possibility of the death penalty for causing serious injury or death in motor vehicle accidents. Despite its hasty introduction, enforcement of the law has been inconsistent, leading to no significant improvement in road safety. Road accidents have continued to increase, while the government has reduced fines and sentences, attributed to entrenched interests and conflicts of interest between businesses, regulatory authorities, and politicians.

==== Congestion ====

Road traffic congestion is a common issue in major cities, caused by an increasing number of vehicles due to population growth, inadequate road infrastructure, and the presence of slow-moving vehicles like rickshaws, among other factors. Traffic congestion varies during the day, necessitating planning and longer trips; this impacts productivity, cutting across social and economic status. Although walking is a major travel mode of the low-income majority, pedestrian needs are ignored in transport planning. Despite comprising four percent of total vehicles, private cars occupy about 70 percent of road space.

==== Pollution ====
A significant contributor to air pollution in urban areas is motor vehicle emissions. In Bangladesh, pollution severity is exacerbated by a large number of high-polluting vehicles, impure fuel, inefficient land use, and poor traffic management. Leaded gasoline was banned in 1999, and the change to compressed natural gas (CNG) cars in early 2000s saved over 4,000 premature deaths in 2009, but their low cost has increased the number of cars on the roads (although CNG price increases may have tempered the increase) and decreased the amount of natural gas available for other purposes.

Dhaka is the noisiest city in the world, with levels 1.3 to 2 times higher than acceptable limits. The Farmgate intersection in Dhaka experiences the highest noise pollution at 135.6 decibels, while the least polluted area, Uttara-14, registers 100.8 decibels, still far above the permissible level. Rajshahi ranked the fourth noisiest in the world, while noise levels are also above acceptable limits in other cities like Chittagong, Sylhet, Comilla, and Khulna. Despite a ban on the import of loud hydraulic horns in 2017, they remain in widespread illegal use.

== Rail ==
The national rail infrastructure is primarily passenger-focused, managed by the state-owned Bangladesh Railway (BR), which was largely inherited from the British Assam Bengal Railway system after the partition of India in 1947. There are about 500 railway stations, with Dhaka Kamalapur being the largest and busiest. In 2023, Bangladesh Railway operated 402 trains daily, and 40 were operated by private companies (), a practice permitted since the early 2000s. New legislation drafted in 2024 as a successor to a centuries-old law includes provisions allowing private companies to own rolling stock for carrying passengers, goods, and parcels.Bangladesh Railway has approximately of main and branch lines (route km) linking 43 of the 64 districts. Of these, the majority, covering , are metre-gauge tracks, mainly in the central and eastern regions. About are broad-gauge tracks, concentrated in the western region. The gauge difference is being addressed by adding third rails to major routes, making them dual gauge, with a total of about converted. Since independence in 1971, few new tracks were laid until the early 20s, when four additional districts were connected.

In 2020, 64 million passengers travelled by rail in Bangladesh, accumulating nearly 10 billion passenger-kilometres. Despite the railway&#x27;s emphasis on intercity services, which earned the majority of revenue, almost half of these passengers were on local routes. More than three million tonnes of cargo were transported, totalling over one billion tonne-kilometres, handled by two inland container depots (dry ports): one at Kamalapur, Dhaka, and the other at Pangaon, which is connected to Chittagong port. Regardless of its significance, the railway system faces several challenges—including ageing and scarcity of rolling stock, poor track conditions, and a lack of manpower—leading to substantial losses for Bangladesh Railway.

About 93 million passengers used railways in 2019, while the figure was 73 million in 1970. However, the modal share of rail transport has been decreasing since 1975, dropping from 30 per cent of passenger traffic and 28 per cent of cargo traffic to just 4 per cent for both in 2005.

, the country has only one metro line, located in Dhaka, which opened in December 2022. The Dhaka Metro Rail is operated by the Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited, with additional lines under construction.

=== Important links ===
The Hardinge Bridge, opened in 1915, connected the south-western railways to the north-western regions divided by the Padma River. The Bhairab Railway Bridge (also Bangladesh–UK Friendship Bridge), opened in 1937, facilitates communication between Dhaka and Chittagong over the Meghna River. The combined Bangabandhu Bridge, opened in 1998, connects the eastern and western rail networks, which were previously separated by the Jamuna River. A dedicated rail bridge beside it is planned to be opened by August 2024 to meet growing traffic demands.

Railway penetration has been relatively low in the riverine south-western regions of the Ganges Delta, particularly from the capital and the north-east, due to the Padma River acting as a barrier. The crucial Padma Bridge Rail Link Project, scheduled for completion by mid-2024, aims to address this issue.

=== International rail ===
The border between India and Bangladesh cuts across railway lines, forcing them into the adjacent country for short distances and complicating border controls such as passport validation. After 43 years, the Maitree Express renewed rail transport between Bangladesh and Kolkata of India in 2008. A second rail service, the Bandhan Express, connecting Kolkata and Khulna, began in 2017. A third service, the Mitali Express, from Siliguri to Dhaka, started in June 2022.

Bangladesh is part of the Trans–Asian railway network. As part of the project, it planned to extend the railway from Chittagong to Cox&#x27;s Bazar, with the eventual goal of connecting to Myanmar. However, as of 2022, the plan was to end the track at Cox&#x27;s Bazar due to deteriorating bilateral relations.
== Air ==

Air travel in Bangladesh peaked at over 17 million passengers in 2023. The Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh, which manages and regulates civil aviation activities in the country, reported that the number of outbound travellers from Bangladesh in 2022 was 4.2 million, marking a 124 per cent year-on-year increase. This surge was primarily attributed to migrant workers and pilgrimage. Conversely, 3.5 million travellers arrived in Bangladesh during the same period. Approximately 285,000 tonnes of cargo were transported by air in 2023, with over 30 airlines operating cargo flights to and from the country.

=== Airports ===
Of the three international airports in Bangladesh, Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka is the largest and busiest, handling 11.6 million passengers in 2023, which included 52 per cent of domestic and international flights. That year, it served 9.4 million international passengers, with 33 international airlines operating about 160 daily flights. Additionally, it handled 2.2 million domestic passengers with four private airlines and one national airline conducting 170 daily domestic flights. Hazrat Shahjalal processed about 96 per cent of the total air freight, handling a daily average of 400 to 500 tonnes of cargo. Originally built to handle eight million annual passengers, the airport&#x27;s capacity is expected to more than double to 20 million once the modern third terminal opens fully in October 2024.

Chittagong&#x27;s Shah Amanat International Airport ranks second, handling 17 percent of passengers. As of 2022, six foreign and two domestic airlines operates flights from Shah Amanat, primarily to destinations in the Middle East. The airport, undergoing significant expansions and renovations, has reported a 20 per cent increase in annual revenue. Osmani International Airport in Sylhet is the third, having seen its first international flight in 2017, and is also undergoing major expansions as of 2023.

In addition to the international airports, there are five operational airports handling domestic-only flights: Barisal, Cox&#x27;s Bazar, Jessore, Shah Makhdum (Rajshahi), and Saidpur (Nilphamari). Nearly all services at these airports are to or from Dhaka.

The opening of the Padma Bridge in 2022 has particularly impacted air traffic to south-western airports like Jessore and Barisal. Cox’s Bazar, a destination that accounts for the bulk of domestic airline revenue, has also seen a decline in air passengers due to a new railway link opened in 2023. Despite this, the government has undertaken projects worth to modernise all airports by 2023. Cox&#x27;s Bazar airport is being upgraded to international status as of 2024, which includes extending its runway to become the longest in the country. Saidpur airport is being turned into a regional hub to facilitate flights from neighbouring countries such as Nepal, Bhutan, and north-east India, while Khan Jahan Ali Airport in Khulna is still under construction, as of 2023.

=== Airlines ===
Biman Bangladesh Airlines, the country&#x27;s national airline, served eight domestic destinations and 22 international destinations in 16 countries, in 2023. The airline, founded in 1972, has its hub at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport.

Other Bangladeshi-registered passenger airlines include US-Bangla Airlines, Novoair, Air Astra, and Fly Dhaka. All these carriers have their hub at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport and operate domestic flights. Except for Air Astra and Fly Dhaka, the aforementioned airlines also offer international flights. As of 2024, Fly Dhaka Airlines marks the 12th private airline to join Bangladesh&#x27;s aviation sector since the 2000s. However, this period has also witnessed the closure of at least eight private airlines, the most recent being Regent Airways in 2022, primarily due to financial difficulties.

Foreign airlines dominate about 75 per cent of the international route market, with the remaining 25 per cent held by Biman and US-Bangla Airlines. Additionally, more than 80 per cent of the domestic market is controlled by US-Bangla Airlines and Air Astra, both owned by US-Bangla Group. Biman holds less than 20 per cent of the domestic market share, while Novoair covers the rest.

Dedicated cargo airlines of Bangladesh include Bismillah Airlines, Easy Fly Express, SkyAir, Hello Airlines and NXT Air.

== Water ==
=== Inland waterways ===
There are approximately of navigable waterways depending on the season, including up to of major cargo routes. In 2009, it was reported that 20 million tonnes of freight and 90 million passengers utilised inland waterways for transportation annually. However, this number has been in decline, particularly following the opening of the Padma Bridge in 2022, which significantly reduced travel time between south-western Bangladesh and the capital, Dhaka, by road and rail. The modal share of passenger transport through inland waterways in Bangladesh was 8 per cent in 2005, down from 16 per cent in 1975. In 2005, 16 per cent of cargo traffic in Bangladesh used inland waterways, a decrease from 37 per cent in 1975. The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) is responsible for the development, maintenance, and regulation of inland water transport and navigable waterways in Bangladesh.

=== Ferries ===

The country&#x27;s extensive river network makes ferries a practical and affordable mode of transport. Passenger ferries, locally referred to as &quot;launches,&quot; are widely used to travel to the southern and south-western regions of Bangladesh from the capital. The most popular destinations include Barisal, Bhola, Patuakhali, and Khulna. Additionally, there are water-transport routes connecting Dhaka with Kolkata in India.

Approximately 200 launches operate across 107 water routes throughout the country . To support the launch services, the BIWTA has developed 292 wharfs (&quot;ghats&quot;) for the docking of these vessels, and oversees 380 launch terminals.

There are 53 roll-on/roll-off ferries running on seven routes across the country: Paturia–Daulatdia, Aricha–Kazirhat, Shimulia–Banglabazar, Bhola–Lakshmipur, Lajarhat–Veduria, Char Kalipur–Kalipur Bazar and Harinaghat Chandpur–Shariatpur.

More than 800,000 small and medium wooden sailboats and rowboats, often retrofitted to be motorised, are an important means of transportation for people and goods across the country, especially during the rainy season. These boats transport over 1.2 million tonnes of freight annually. Among these are the &quot;dingi&quot;, which is the oldest form of Bengal boat. Larger cargo boats includes vessels such as the &quot;balam&quot;, &quot;bajra&quot; and &quot;sampan&quot;. Under the category of &quot;bainkata&quot; (flat-bottomed) boats are the &quot;ghasi&quot;, &quot;gachari&quot;, &quot;dorakha&quot;, &quot;kathami&quot;, &quot;mallar&quot;, &quot;patam&quot; and &quot;panshi&quot;, among others. Ubiquitous throughout Bangladesh, especially in monsoon flood-prone regions, is the &quot;kosha,&quot; a small, highly manoeuvrable boat that is easy to operate. These various traditional wooden boats play a vital role in providing transportation during the rainy season when other modes become impractical due to flooding.

The ferries are often overloaded and continue to operate in poor weather; many people die each year in ferry and launch accidents. From 2005 to 2015, nearly 1,800 casualties have been reported due to river transport incidents, a number which may be higher due to the prevalence of unregistered vessels. In 2014, the launch &quot;Pinak 6&quot; sank in the Padma River with more than 200 passengers aboard near Munshiganj&#x27;s Louhajang Upazila.

=== Merchant marine ===
, the country&#x27;s merchant navy consisted of 558 ships, including 68 bulk carriers, 10 container ships, 170 cargo ships and 162 oil tankers. The Bangladesh Shipping Corporation, a state-owned entity overseeing the management of ocean-going vessels, has seven ships in its fleet, including tanker ships dedicated to transporting oil for Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation and five ships operating on a charter basis for carrying oil, chemicals, and other products.

=== Ports and harbours ===
Bangladesh has 22 major river ports used for loading and unloading passengers and goods, as well as for landing motorised marine vessels. These include:

Dhaka, Narayanganj, Barisal, Chandpur, Khulna, Baghabari, Patuakhali, Narsingdi, Aricha, Nagarbari, Daulatdia, Tongi, Maoa, Char Jannat, Ashugonj (Bhairab Bazar), Bhola, Barguna, Noapara, Munshiganj, Chatak, Meghnaghat and Cox&#x27;s Bazar.

In addition to these major ports, there are 448 small to medium-sized ports throughout the country.

Chittagong is the busiest sea port in Bangladesh, handling 92 per cent of the country&#x27;s international cargo, followed by Mongla and Payra. The Matarbari Port, under construction, will be the first deep-sea port capable of accommodating large ships by 2026.

== Pipelines ==
In 2013, Bangladesh had about of natural gas pipelines. In 2023, the first cross-border pipeline to import petroleum products from India was inaugurated, totalling in length. In the same year, the first under-sea pipeline to transport crude oil and diesel from a deep-sea mooring, spanning , was commissioned.

<text>The Bangladesh Armed Forces () are the military forces of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh. They consist of the three uniformed military services: the Bangladesh Army, the Bangladesh Navy, and the Bangladesh Air Force. The Armed Forces are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defence of the Government of Bangladesh, and are directly administered by the Armed Forces Division of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. The President of Bangladesh serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the Bangladesh Armed Forces. Bangladesh has the third-largest defence budget in South Asia. The Bangladeshi military is also the 35th strongest in the world and the third most powerful military force in South Asia. Border Guard Bangladesh and Bangladesh Coast Guard are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs during peacetime, but during wartime, they fall under the command of the Bangladesh Army and the Bangladesh Navy, respectively.

Military policy is formulated and executed by the Armed Forces Division (AFD), whereas the Ministry of Defence (MoD) does not exercise any operational or policy authority over the Armed Forces. Since independence, the AFD and MoD have been led by the Prime Minister. To coordinate military policy with foreign and intelligence policy, both the President and the Prime Minister are advised by a six-member advisory board, which consists of the three military services&#x27; Chiefs of Staff, the Principal Staff Officer of the Armed Forces Division, and military secretaries to the President and the Prime Minister. The directors-general of the NSI, the DGFI, and the BGB also serve in an advisory capacity when invited.

Armed Forces Day is observed on 21 November and commemorates the founding of the three services of the Armed Forces, who subsequently initiated a joint military operation against the occupying Pakistani Armed Forces during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Official functions are held across the country, including at Bangabhaban, the Armed Forces Division Headquarters at Dhaka Cantonment, all military cantonments, and at every military installation throughout Bangladesh.

==History==
===Eastern wing of Pakistan===

With the partitioning of India on 15 August 1947, the territory constituting modern Bangladesh was partitioned from the province of Bengal as East Bengal, joining the newly created state of Pakistan. Ethnic and sectional discrimination prevailed in all sectors of the state. Like other government sectors, Bengalis were under-represented in the Pakistani military too. Officers of Bengali origin in the different wings of the armed forces made up just 5% of overall force by 1965. West Pakistanis believed that Bengalis were not &quot;martially inclined&quot; unlike Pashtuns and Punjabis; the &quot;Martial Races&quot; notion was dismissed as ridiculous and humiliating by Bengalis. Moreover, despite huge defence spending, East Pakistan received none of the benefits, such as contracts, purchasing and military support jobs. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 over Kashmir also highlighted the sense of military insecurity among Bengalis as only an under-strength infantry division and 15 combat aircraft without tank support were in East Pakistan to repel any Indian retaliations during the conflict.

The East Bengal Regiment was formed on 15 February 1948 following Pakistan&#x27;s independence and transition from post British rule, composed exclusively of men from the western part of the country. The first East Bengal Regiment was composed of Bengali members of the &quot;British Indian Army Pioneer Corps&quot; and &quot;Bihar Regiment&quot; of the abolished &quot;British-Indian army&quot;. Between 1948 and 1965, a total of eight battalions of EBR were raised.

===Bangladesh War of Independence===

Following the victory of the Awami League in the 1970 elections, then-president General Yahya Khan refused to appoint its leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the prime minister and launched a brutal attack named &quot;Operation Searchlight&quot; on the Bengali nationalists of the then East Pakistan, using the Pakistan Army to repress political movements. The number of people killed by Pakistani forces vary from a minimum of around 300,000 to a maximum of around 3 million. Responding to Mujib&#x27;s call for rebellion, many students, workers and other civilians mutinied against Pakistan and raised the Mukti Bahini, a guerrilla force. Later on, many Bengali officers and units from the Pakistan Army and East Pakistan Rifles mutinied against their West Pakistani counterparts and joined the Mukti Bahini. On 17 April 1971, M. A. G Osmani took oath as the commander-in-chief of Mukti Bahini. While the war raged on, the necessity of a well-trained armed force was always felt. During the first Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference, held from 11 to 17 July 1971, the Bangladesh Forces started its journey composed of the revolting Bengali members of the Pakistan Army and EPR. In this historic conference the field command structure, sector reorganization, reinforcement, appointment of field commanders and tactics of warfare were decided upon and carried out. On 21 November 1971, the Bangladesh Forces was divided into three separate services as Bangladesh Army, Bangladesh Navy and Bangladesh Air Force.

The Bangladesh Forces received modest assistance from the Indian Government soon after the start of the war, On 3 December 1971, the India-Pakistan war broke out and Indian troops entered Bangladesh allied with the Bangladesh Armed Forces. On 16 December 1971, the Pakistani military surrendered to the joint Indian and Bangladesh forces.

=== Post-independence ===

The newly formed Bangladeshi armed forces incorporated some of the units and guerrillas of the Mukti Bahini. Gen. Osmani, who had led the Mukti Bahini was appointed the General of the Bangladesh armed forces. For many years, there was active discrimination in favour of the inductees from the Mukti Bahini against those Bengali officers who had continued service in the Pakistani armed forces or had been detained in West Pakistan. A group of angered officers assassinated the president Sheikh Mujib on 15 August 1975 and established a regime with politician Khondaker Mostaq Ahmed as President of Bangladesh and new army chief Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman. The military itself was subject of divisions as Mujib&#x27;s assassins were overthrown by the pro-Mujib Brig. Gen. Khaled Mosharraf on 3 November, who himself was soon overthrown by a socialist group of officers under Col. Abu Taher on 7 November who returned Ziaur Rahman to power—an event now called the &quot;Sipoy-Janata Biplob&quot; (&quot;Soldiers and People&#x27;s Coup&quot;). Under the presidency of Ziaur Rahman, the military was reorganised to remove conflicts between rival factions and discontented cadre. However, Ziaur Rahman was himself overthrown in a 1981 coup attempt, and a year later, Lt. Gen. Hossain Mohammad Ershad took power from the elected government of president Abdus Sattar. The military remained the most important force in national politics under the regimes of Ziaur Rahman and later Hossain Mohammad Ershad until democracy was restored in 1991.

=== Modern period ===
Having relied primarily on India and the Soviet Union for military aid, Bangladesh has also developed military ties with the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the United States. The Bangladesh Army has been actively involved in United Nations Peace Support Operations (UNPSO). During the first Gulf War in 1991, the Bangladesh Army sent a 2,193 member team to monitor peace in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The Bangladesh Army also participated in peace keeping activities in Namibia, Cambodia, Somalia, Uganda, Rwanda, Mozambique, former Yugoslavia, Liberia, Haiti, Tajikistan, Western Sahara, Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Georgia, East Timor, Congo, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Ethiopia. As of October 2008, Bangladesh remained the second largest contributor with 9,800 troops in the UN Peacekeeping forces.

Until a peace accord was signed in 1997, the Bangladeshi military engaged in counterinsurgency operations in the Chittagong Hill Tracts fighting the Shanti Bahini separatist group. In 2001, Bangladeshi military units engaged in clashes with the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) along the northern border.

Several projects and schemes aiming to expand and modernize the Bangladeshi armed forces were launched by the government of former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia.

Forces Goal 2030 was launched by the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to secure new equipment for the Bangladeshi military.

===Bangladesh-Myanmar border===
Standoffs have occasionally occurred at the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, including in 1991 and 2008. Most of the standoffs took place, when Myanmar attempted to force Rohingyas into Bangladesh. In 2008, the two countries deployed warships after Myanmar attempted to explore a disputed Bay of Bengal seabed for oil and gas. The dispute was resolved at an international tribunal in 2012. Bangladesh and Myanmar have also conducted counter-insurgency operations on the border.

* 2015 Bangladesh-Arakan Army border clash

With 10,736 troops deployed, it ranks first in personnel contributions to UN peacekeeping. The government declined to participate in Iraq on a request from the United States. The deployment to Liberia began in October 2003 and has remained at a level of about 3,200 who are participating in peacekeeping, charitable activities and infrastructure development.
