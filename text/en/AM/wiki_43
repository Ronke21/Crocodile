<text>Transport in Bhutan uses about of roads and four airports, three of which are operational and interconnected. Paro Airport is the only airport which accommodates international flights. As part of Bhutan&#x27;s infrastructure modernization programs, its road system has been under development since the 1960s. There are no railways (although one is planned), and as Bhutan is a landlocked country with no major waterways, there are no ports.

==Road==
Bhutan had a total of of roads in 2003, of which were paved and unpaved. Because of the lack of paved roads, travel in Bhutan was by foot or on mule- or horseback until 1961; the trip from the Indian border to Thimphu took six days. Road construction began in earnest during the First Development Plan (1961–66). The first paved road was completed in 1962. A branch road later linked Paro with the Phuntsholing–Thimphu road, and a jeep track linked Thimphu and Phuntsholing with Jaigaon, West Bengal. Travel time by motor vehicle from the border to Thimphu shrank to six hours. About 30,000 Indian and Nepalese labourers were imported to build the road with Indian aid when India was bolstering its defence against a potential Chinese invasion. Bhutan also provided labour for the construction work. Another road was built to connect Trashigang with Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh.
About of roads were built by the mid-1970s, largely with manual labour. There was a road network in 1989; at least were paved with asphalt, and were classified as national highways. Despite the construction of paved roads linking the principal towns in the south, mountainous terrain elsewhere makes travel difficult even from one valley to the next. Most roads run in river valleys. As part of the Sixth Development Plan (1987–92), the Department of Public Works (in cooperation with the Indian Border Roads Organization) made plans to construct and upgrade of roads and to extend the road network through Bhutan&#x27;s five major river valleys by 1992. Driveable roads were not the only important development; as part of the Fifth Development Plan, Bhutan also needed an estimated of mule tracks to connect the country&#x27;s 4,500 settlements.

The country&#x27;s primary road is the East-West Highway (known locally as the Lateral Road), which began construction in 1962. The road begins in Phuentsholing on the southwestern Indian border and ends in Trashigang in the far east, with spurs to other major centres such as Paro, Thimphu, and Punakha. The Lateral Road must support traffic in both directions, since the cost of cutting a wider road through the middle Himalayas would be prohibitive. Safety barriers, road markings, and signage are sparse. Traffic is slow, typically about , to minimise head-on collisions. Road accidents are still frequent and, because of the steep topography, typically horrific. Most of the route between Paro Airport and Thimphu has been improved as a two-lane road.
The Lateral Road traverses a number of high passes, including Tremo La and Do Chu La. The highest pass on the road is at Chapcha; the second-highest pass is at Trumshing La, in central Bhutan, at an altitude of over .

Main roads in western and eastern Bhutan are maintained by Dantak, a task force of India&#x27;s Border Roads Organisation. Roads in the rest of the country are maintained by the Bhutanese government&#x27;s Department of Roads.

Much of the country&#x27;s geology is unstable and there are frequent slips and landslides, aggravated by the summer monsoon and winter snowstorms and frost heaving. Teams of Indian labourers are housed at work camps in the mountain passes to clear blocked roads. Conditions in the camps are poor, with workers breaking rocks into gravel on a piece-rate basis when not clearing the roads. An international aid project is underway to stabilise the worst sections of the road. A major Japanese aid project aims to replace most of the narrow, single-track bridges with two-way girder spans capable of carrying heavier traffic.

Most freight is moved on eight-ton Tata trucks, which are often overloaded. There is a network of passenger buses, and the most common vehicle in government and private use is the four-wheel-drive pickup truck.

A national driver-licensing system includes a driving test. Government drivers are trained at the Samthang Vocational Training Institute&#x27;s driving school (formerly the National Driving Training Institute). The roads have traffic lights; although a stoplight in Thimphu was dismantled, there are reportedly plans to reinstall it.

==Rail==

Bhutan has no railways. On 25 January 2005 the king of Bhutan and the prime minister of India signed an agreement to establish the following the link and initiated the feasibility study. These rail links are listed from west to east and subcategorised by connection to respective states of India:

* West Bengal state of India:
** Banarhat–Samtse line, ? km: from Banarhat in India to border town Samtse in Bhutan.
** &quot;Hasimara–Phuentsholing-Pasakha line&quot; (Hasimara–Toribari-Pasakha line), ? km long: from Hasimara to (Toribari)Phuentsholing and then further 18 km to Pasakha. In December 2009 the king of Bhutan approved the final plan to build an , broad gauge rail link between Hashimara in West Bengal and Toribari in Bhutan. The railway, via Satali, Bharna Bari and Dalsingpara, will be built and owned by Indian Railways.

* Assam state of India:
** &quot;Kokrajhar–Gelephu line&quot;, 57 km long: From Kokrajhar in Assam in India to border town of Gelephu in Bhutan. The survey was completed in April 2023 and construction will be completed by 2026. This will be the first line to be constructed and after that remaining lines will be constructed.
** Pathsala–Nganglam line, 40 km: from Pathsala in India to border town Nganglam (Naglam) in Bhutan.
** Rangiya–Darrang–Samdrup Jongkhar line, 60 km: from Rangia &amp; Darrang in India to bordertown Samdrup Jongkhar in Bhutan.

==Air==
Bhutan has four airports, Paro, Bathpalathang, Yongphulla, and Gelephu Airport. Paro, the country&#x27;s only international airport, is in a steep-sided valley with its approaches restricted to visual flight rules. During the monsoon season, flights are often delayed by cloud cover. Drukair is the national carrier, connecting Paro with other countries.

The airport is one of the highest and most-challenging airports at which to land. Minimal equipment is available to pilots, and special training is required to land in the narrow valley on the short runway. Winds and bad weather may delay or cancel a flight, and the best travel times are April to May and October to November.

Bathpalathang and Yongphulla are Bhutan&#x27;s domestic airports. The Royal Bhutanese Government&#x27;s 10th Five-Year Plan (2008–13) included the construction of a domestic airport at Gelephu in Sarpang District. An international airport was planned for the Gelephu site, but the project&#x27;s scope was downgraded to a domestic airport in October 2008. In January 2010, the Bhutanese Department of Civil Aviation indicated that the domestic airport at Gelephu may be expanded into an all-weather airport capable of international traffic in the future. Construction was due to begin in late 2010, with the airport commencing operation in June 2011.

<text>The branches of the armed forces of Bhutan are the Royal Bhutan Army (RBA), Royal Bodyguards, and Royal Bhutan Police. Bhutan does not have an air force, nor (being a landlocked country) a navy. India is responsible for military training, arms supplies and the air defense of Bhutan. Bhutan&#x27;s army is trained by the Indian Armed Forces.

==Air support==
The RBA relies on the Eastern Air Command of the Indian Air Force for air assistance. In recent years India has helped Bhutan start to develop its military in all areas through military donations and training. Total 8,000 Army personnel. Historically, on 1 of January 1971 the Government of Bhutan decided to increase military personnel to 4,850 by recruiting additional 600-700 recruits and stricter regulations on liberation from service. Indian Air Force helicopters evacuated RBA casualties to India for treatment during Operation All Clear in 2003.

<doc id="69008" wikidata="Q869078" url="?curid=69008" title="Foreign relations of Bhutan">
<text>Bhutan has diplomatic relations with 56 of the 193 member states of the United Nations and the European Union. This limited number, and the absence of formal relations with any of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, is part of a deliberate isolationist policy of limiting foreign influence in the state. This stance has been safeguarded by close relations with India, of which Bhutan has previously been considered a protected state.

In 1971, sponsored by India, Bhutan began to develop its foreign relations by joining the United Nations. In 1981, Bhutan joined the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, followed by the World Health Organization and UNESCO in 1982. It is also an active member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Bhutan is currently a member of 45 international organizations.

Under Article 20 of the Constitution of Bhutan enacted in 2008, Bhutan&#x27;s foreign relations fall under the purview of the monarch, the Druk Gyalpo on the advice of the Executive, which includes the Prime Minister and other Ministers of the Lhengye Zhungtshog including the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

==Diplomatic relations==
Bhutan has embassies in Bangladesh, Belgium, India, Kuwait, Australia and Thailand. Conversely, only Bangladesh, India, and Kuwait have embassies in Thimphu. The following is a list of countries with which Bhutan maintains diplomatic relations.

==Asia==
===Bangladesh===
Bangladesh is one of only three nations to maintain a residential embassy in Thimphu. Bhutan was the first country in the world to recognize Bangladeshi independence in 1971. The two states have agreed to develop hydropower in the Himalayas, as well as initiate free trade and transshipment through Bangladeshi ports. They also cooperate in water resources management.
Both Bhutan and Bangladesh are members of SAARC and BIMSTEC.

===China===
Bhutan has no diplomatic relations with its northern neighbor, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and is one of the few countries that do not recognise or have relations with either of the Two Chinas. The border between Bhutan and the PRC has been closed since the invasion of Tibet in 1950, which caused an influx of refugees. The border also remains undelineated; in 1961 China published a map that altered the traditional border. Tensions have since lessened, especially after an agreement on border peace and tranquility was signed in 1998: the first bilateral agreement between China and Bhutan. Despite the lack of formal diplomatic relations, Bhutan has also maintained an Honorary Consul in Macau since 2000 and in Hong Kong since 2004.

In late 2005, Bhutan claimed that PLA soldiers were building roads and bridges within Bhutanese territory. Bhutanese Foreign Minister Khandu Wangchuk took up the matter with Chinese authorities after the issue was raised in the Bhutanese parliament. In response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang of the People&#x27;s Republic of China has said that the border remains in dispute and that the two sides are continuing to work for a peaceful and cordial resolution of the dispute. The Bhutanese newspaper &quot;Kuensel&quot; has said that China might use the roads to further Chinese claims along the border.

===India===
Historically, ties with India have been close. Both countries signed a first ever Friendship treaty in 1865 between Bhutan and British India. When Bhutan became a monarchy, British India was the first country to recognize it and renewed the treaty in 1910. Bhutan was the first country to recognize Indian independence and renewed the age old treaty with the new government in 1949, including a clause that India would assist Bhutan in foreign relations. On 8 February 2007, the Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty was substantially revised under the Bhutanese King, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. In the Treaty of 1949 Article 2 read as &quot;The Government of India undertakes to exercise no interference in the internal administration of Bhutan. On its part the Government of Bhutan agrees to be guided by the advice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations.&quot; In the revised treaty this now reads as, &quot;In keeping with the abiding ties of close friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and India, the Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan and the Government of the Republic of India shall cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests. Neither government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other.&quot; The revised treaty also includes in it the preamble &quot;Reaffirming their respect for each other&#x27;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity&quot;, an element that was absent in the earlier version. The Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty of 2007 strengthens Bhutan&#x27;s status as an independent and sovereign nation.

There also exists bi-lateral agreement between Bhutanese and Indian Government wherein citizens of both nations can travel freely in other country without passport or visa.

===Israel===
Bhutan and Israel established formal diplomatic relations in 2020, with the key areas of cooperation being economic, technological and agricultural development.

===Nepal===
Nepal and Bhutan established relations in 1983. However, since 1992, relations with Nepal have been tense due to the repatriation of refugees from Bhutan.

===Philippines===
The Philippines and Bhutan have no formal relations yet. The Philippines has an embassy in New Delhi, India as representative to dialogues with Bhutan. Numerous senators and high-profile personalities from the Philippines have visited Bhutan and have been pushing for the Gross National Happiness to also be applied in the Philippines, citing its effectiveness and efficiency in nation-building, environmental and cultural conservation, and human rights upholding. Filipina senator Loren Legarda, a United Nations Global Champion for Resilience, has been pushing for greater diplomatic relations between the two countries. In September 2014, the Prime Minister of Bhutan visited the Philippines and the Asian Development Bank headquarters in Manila. In 2018, the Philippines sent its engineers to Bhutan&#x27;s capital in a bid to develop Bhutan&#x27;s space program that will be launched in May.

===South Korea===
Bhutan and South Korea established formal relations on 24 September 1987. South Korea granted Bhutan a total of US$6.21 million in aid between 1987 and 2012. Imports into South Korea are about $382,000 and imports into Bhutan are about $3.27 million ().

==Other countries==
===Russia===
===Turkey===
Both countries established diplomatic relations in 2012. Bhutan and Turkey cooperate through their respective embassies in New Delhi. Trade volume between the two countries was US$1.58 million in 2018 (Bhutanese exports/imports: 1.48/0.1 million USD).

===United States===
The United States and Bhutan have no official diplomatic ties, however, they both maintain &quot;warm, informal relations&quot; with each other, as well as consular relations.

Bhutan is represented by its permanent mission in the United Nations, while the American embassy in New Delhi is currently accredited for Bhutan.

==Transnational issues==
Bhutan has relations with other nations based on transnational issues. Among these issues are extradition, terrorism, and refugees. To a limited extent, Bhutanese law provides frameworks for cooperation with countries which Bhutan has no formal mission.

===Extradition===
Bhutan has a legislated policy on extradition of criminals, both to and from the kingdom. Any nation, with or without formal relations, may request the extradition of fugitives who abscond to Bhutan. The Extradition Act requires nations to provide &quot;all relevant evidence and information&quot; about the accused, after which the Royal Government may in its discretion refer the matter to the High Court of Bhutan. The Court may then issue a summons or warrant, conduct an inquiry, and collect evidence, holding the accused for a maximum of 30 days. Alternatively, the Royal Government may refer the matter to the courts for trial within Bhutan. Bhutan imposes punishments for offenses committed in treaty states generally, and for offenses in other states resulting in return to Bhutan. Offenses are weighed according to gravity, determined by a schedule and two-part test: extraditable offenses are those enumerated (including murder, theft, forgery, and smuggling), or which in Bhutan would be punished by a prison term exceeding twelve months. All felonies in Bhutan are punishable by a minimum of three years&#x27; imprisonment.

Bhutan will refuse requests for extradition if the Royal Government or its courts determine the person is accused of a political offense.

===International cooperation against terrorism===
Bhutan cooperates with India to expel Nagaland separatists; lacking any treaty describing the boundary, Bhutan and China continue negotiations to establish a common boundary alignment to resolve territorial disputes arising from substantial cartographic discrepancies, the largest of which lie in Bhutan&#x27;s northwest and along the Chumbi salient.

===Refugee resettlement===
The U.S. has offered to resettle 60,000 of the 107,000 Bhutanese refugees of Nepalese origin now living in seven U.N. refugee camps in southeastern Nepal. Six other nations—Australia, Canada, Norway, Netherlands, New Zealand and Denmark—have offered to resettle 10,000 each.

Other countries also operate resettlement programs in the camps. Norway has already settled 200 Bhutanese refugees, and Canada has agreed to accept up to 5,000 through to 2012.

<doc id="69010" wikidata="Q451949" url="?curid=69010" title="Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy">
<text>Amadeus IV (119711 June 1253) was Count of Savoy from 1233 to 1253.

Amadeus was born in Montmélian, Savoy. The legitimate heir of Thomas I of Savoy and Margaret of Geneva, he had however to fight with his brothers for the inheritance of Savoy&#x27;s lands after their father&#x27;s death. His brothers Pietro and Aimone spurred a revolt in Aosta Valley against Amadeus, but he was able to crush it with the help of Manfred III of Saluzzo and Boniface II of Montferrat, who were his sons-in-law. Together with his brother, Thomas, he fought against the communes of Turin and Pinerolo, but with uncertain results.

He was succeeded by his young son Boniface.

==Career==
===Head of the family===
As the eldest son of Thomas I of Savoy, Amadeus inherited the county and associated lands on his father&#x27;s death in 1233. However, his brothers Peter and Aymon demanded that he divide the territories and give them their share. In July 1234, he and his brother William convened a family meeting at Château de Chillon. While both sides arrived with armed troops, William was able to negotiate a treaty between the brothers. This treaty kept the lands intact, but recognized the authority of the younger brothers within certain regions under Amadeus. These territories were on the frontiers of Savoy lands, designed to encourage the brothers to expand the county rather than diminish it. When his brother Thomas left his career in the church in 1235, Amadeus granted him similar territories.

Before he had a son, Amadeus changed his mind many times regarding his will. Initially, he had made his sons-in-law his heirs, but in 1235, he rewrote his will in favour of his brother Thomas. In December of that year, it went back to having his sons-in-law as heirs, until Amadeus was preparing for the siege. Then he rewrote the will in favour of Thomas. In March 1239, his daughters convinced him to return it to their favour. On 4 November 1240, Thomas returned and persuaded him to rewrite the will in his brother&#x27;s favour again. When Thomas left, once again the will was reversed. His final will was written in 1252, leaving the title and nearly everything to his son, Boniface, and naming his brother Thomas as regent and second in line for the title.

===Among European powers===
Amadeus faced many challenges in balancing the demands of the greater powers in Europe at that time. Henry III of England wrote to Amadeus in 1235 to seek his consent and blessing to marry the Count&#x27;s niece, Eleanor of Provence In 1238, Amadeus went to the court of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in Turin, where he was knighted by the Emperor. Then with his brothers, he led troops as part of the siege of Brescia. In July 1243, Amadeus and his brother Thomas were ordered by Enzo of Sardinia to join him in a siege of Vercelli, which had recently switched allegiances from the Empire to the Pope. Not only was the attack on the city unsuccessful, but Amadeus and his brother were excommunicated for it. When the brothers wrote to the new Pope Innocent IV to appeal the excommunication, he granted their request.

In late 1244, when Pope Innocent IV fled from Rome, Amadeus met him in Susa and escorted him through the passes to Chambéry, and then provided his brother Philip as escort for the Pope downriver to Lyon. However, Amadeus was then willing to open the same passes to the imperial army. He also signed a treaty with Henry III on 16 January 1246 which gave rights of passage through the passes to the English in exchange for an annual payment of 200 marks. That same month, Amadeus joined a force which went to Provence to rescue his niece, Beatrice of Provence from the forces of Frederick and escort her to her marriage to Charles of Anjou By May 1247, Frederick was ready to move against the Pope. He had gathered his army in Turin, and ordered those still loyal to him in the kingdoms of Arles and France to meet at Chambéry (the capital of Savoy). However, the revolt of Parma pulled Frederick back from this plan. That same summer, Amadeus blocked an attempt by the Pope to send 1500 soldiers to the Lombard League. On 8 November 1248, Frederick asked Amadeus and his brother Thomas to go to Lyon and start negotiations for peace. However, their efforts were unsuccessful and the war continued until the death of Frederick.

==Family and children==
He married twice, and each marriage produced children

*c. 1217, he married Marguerite of Burgundy, daughter of Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy.
** Beatrice of Savoy (d. 1258), married firstly in 1233 Manfred III of Saluzzo (d. 1244), married secondly on 21 April 1247 Manfred of Sicily
** Margaret of Savoy (d. 1254), married firstly on 9 December 1235 Boniface II of Montferrat, married secondly Aymar III, Count of Valentinois
*on 18 December 1244, he married Cecilia of Baux, &quot;Passerose&quot;, daughter of Barral of Baux
** Boniface, Count of Savoy
** Beatrice of Savoy (1250 – 23 February 1292) married Peter of Chalon and &quot;Infante&quot; Manuel of Castile.
** Eleonor of Savoy, married in 1269 Guichard de Beaujeu
** Constance of Savoy, died after 1263

<doc id="69011" wikidata="Q1479899" url="?curid=69011" title="Geography of Bolivia">
<text>The geography of Bolivia includes the Eastern Andes Mountain Range (also called the Cordillera Oriental) which bisects Bolivia roughly from north to south. To the east of that mountain chain are lowland plains of the Amazon Basin, and to the west is the Altiplano which is a highland plateau where Lake Titicaca is located. Bolivia&#x27;s geography has features similar to those of Peru which abuts Bolivia&#x27;s northwest border; like Bolivia, Peru is bisected from north to south by the Eastern Andes Mountains, and these two countries share Lake Titicaca which is the highest navigable lake on Earth. Unlike Peru, however, Bolivia is one of the two landlocked countries in South America, the other being Paraguay, which is located along Bolivia&#x27;s southeast border.

==Overview==
The most prominent feature of the Altiplano is the large lake at its northern end, Lake Titicaca. At above sea level. With a surface area of , it is larger than Puerto Rico and is South America&#x27;s second-largest lake by surface area. Lake Titicaca is also deep, about at its deepest, with an average depth of ; its volume of water is large enough to maintain a constant temperature of . The lake actually moderates the climate for a considerable distance around it, making crops of maize and wheat possible in sheltered areas.

Lake Titicaca drains southward through the slow-moving, reed-filled Desaguadero River to Lake Poopó. In contrast to the freshwater Lake Titicaca, Lake Poopó is salty and shallow, with depths seldom more than .
In western Bolivia, the Cordillera Occidental is a chain of dormant volcanoes and solfataras, volcanic vents emitting sulfurous gases. Bolivia&#x27;s highest peak, the snowcapped Nevado Sajama , is located here. The entire Cordillera is of volcanic origin and an extension of the volcanic region found in southern Peru. Most of the northern part of this range has an elevation of about ; the southern part is somewhat lower. Rainfall, although scanty everywhere, is greater in the northern half, where the land is covered with scrub vegetation. The southern area receives almost no precipitation, and the landscape consists mostly of barren rocks. All of the Cordillera Occidental regions are sparsely populated, and the south is virtually uninhabited.

The Altiplano, the high plateau between the previous range, and the Cordillera Oriental, comprises four major basins formed by mountainous spurs that jut eastward from the Cordillera Occidental about halfway to the Cordillera Oriental. Along the Altiplano&#x27;s eastern side is a continuous flat area, which has served as Bolivia&#x27;s principal north–south transport corridor since colonial times. The entire Altiplano was originally a deep rift between the cordilleras that gradually filled with highly porous sedimentary debris washed down from the peaks. This sedimentary origin explains its gradual slope from north to south; greater rainfall in the north has washed a larger quantity of debris onto the platform floor.

Rainfall in the Altiplano decreases towards the south, and the scrub vegetation grows more sparse, eventually giving way to barren rocks and dry red clay. The land contains several salt flats, the dried remnants of ancient lakes. The largest of these – and the world&#x27;s largest salt concentration – is the Uyuni Saltpan, which covers over 9,000 square kilometers. The salt is more than five meters deep in the center of this flat. In the dry season, the lake bed can be traversed by heavy trucks. Near the Argentine border, the floor of the Altiplano rises again, creating hills and volcanoes that span the gap between the eastern and western cordilleras of the Andes.

The much older Cordillera Oriental enters Bolivia on the north side of Lake Titicaca, extends southeastward to approximately 17 south latitude, then broadens and stretches south to the Argentine border. The northernmost part of the Cordillera Oriental, the Cordillera Real, is an impressive snow-capped series of granite mountains. Some of these peaks exceed and two – Illimani , which overlooks the city of La Paz, and Illampu – have large glaciers on their upper slopes. South of 17 south latitudes, the range changes character. Called the Cordillera Central here, the land is a large block of the Earth&#x27;s crust that has been lifted and tilted eastward. The western edge of this block rises in a series of cliffs from the Altiplano. The backbone of the cordillera is a high, rolling plain, with elevations from , interspersed with irregularly spaced high peaks. Too high to be exploited for large-scale commercial grazing, this area takes its name from the predominant vegetation type, the puna.
Bolivia has three drainage basins:

*The first is the Amazon Basin, also called the North Basin (/66% of the territory). The rivers of this basin generally have big meanders which form lakes such as Murillo Lake in Pando Department. The main Bolivian tributary to the Amazon basin is the Mamoré River, with a length of running north to the confluence with the Beni River, in length and the second most important river of the country. The Beni River, along with the Madeira River, forms the main tributary of the Amazon River. From east to west, the basin is formed by other important rivers, such as the Madre de Dios River, the Orthon River, the Abuna River, the Yata River, and the Guaporé River. The most important lakes are Rogaguado Lake, Rogagua Lake, and Jara Lake.
*The second is the Río de la Plata Basin, also called the South Basin (/21% of the territory). The tributaries in this basin are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon Basin. The Rio de la Plata Basin is mainly formed by the Paraguay River, Pilcomayo River, and Bermejo River. The most important lakes are Uberaba Lake and Mandioré Lake, both located in the Bolivian marshland.
*The third basin is the Central Basin, which is an endorheic basin (/13% of the territory). The &quot;Altiplano&quot; has large numbers of lakes and rivers that do not run into any ocean because they are enclosed by the Andean mountains. The most important river is the Desaguadero River, with a length of , the longest river of the &quot;Altiplano&quot;; it begins in Lake Titicaca and then runs in a southeast direction to Poopó Lake. The basin is then formed by Lake Titicaca, Lake Poopó, the Desaguadero River, and great salt flats, including the &quot;Salar de Uyuni&quot; and Coipasa Lake.
In Bolivia forest cover is around 47% of the total land area, equivalent to 50,833,760 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 57,804,720 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 50,771,160 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 62,600 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 24% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership.

==Valleys==

The northeastern flank of the Cordillera Real is known as the Yungas, from the Aymara and Quechua word &quot;yunka&quot; meaning &quot;warm valley&quot;. The steep, almost inaccessible slopes and peaks of this mainly semitropical valley area northeast of La Paz offer some of the most spectacular scenery in Bolivia. Rainfall is heavy, and lush vegetation clings to the sides of narrow river valleys. The land is among the most fertile in Bolivia, but poor transport has hindered its agricultural development. The government attempted to build a railway through the Yungas in 1917 to connect La Paz with the eastern lowlands. The railway was abandoned, however, after completion of only 150 kilometres.

The eastern slopes of the Cordillera Central descend gradually in a series of complex north–south ranges and hills. Rivers, draining to the east, have cut long narrow valleys; these valleys and the basins between the ranges are favorable areas for crops and settlement. Rich alluvial soils fill the low areas, but erosion has followed the removal of vegetation in some places. The valley floors range from 2,000 to 3,000 metres above sea level, and this lower elevation means milder temperatures than those of the Altiplano. The cities of Sucre, Cochabamba and the upper area of Tarija department, are located in basins of this vast region.

==Lowlands==
The eastern lowlands include all of Bolivia north and east of the Andes. Although comprising over two-thirds of the national territory, the region is sparsely populated and, until recently, has played a minor role in the economy.

Differences in topography and climate separate the lowlands into three areas. The flat northern area, made up of Beni and Pando Departments and the northern part of Cochabamba Department, consists of rainforest. Because much of the topsoil is underlain by claypan, drainage is poor, and heavy rainfall periodically converts vast parts of the region to swamp. The central area, comprising the northern half of Santa Cruz Department, has gently rolling hills and a drier climate than the north. Forests alternate with savanna, and much of the land has been cleared for cultivation. Santa Cruz, the largest city in the lowlands, is located here, as are most of Bolivia&#x27;s petroleum and natural gas reserves. The southeastern part of the lowlands is part of the Gran Chaco. Virtually rainless for nine months of the year, this area becomes flooded for the three months of heavy rains. The extreme variation in rainfall supports only thorny scrub vegetation and cattle grazing, although recent discoveries of natural gas and petroleum near the foothills of the Andes have attracted some settlers to the region.

Most of Bolivia&#x27;s important rivers are found in the water-rich northern parts of the lowlands, particularly in the Alto Beni (Upper Beni), where the land is suitable for crops such as coffee and cacao. The northern lowlands are drained by wide, slow-moving rivers, the three largest of which—the Mamoré, Beni, and Madre de Dios—all flow northward into the Madeira River in Brazil and eventually into the River Amazon. Riverboats along the Beni and the Mamoré carry both passenger and freight traffic; rapids on the Madeira prevent river traffic farther into Brazil. Near the Paraguayan border, shallow sandy streams carry the seasonal runoff into the Pilcomayo or Paraguay rivers. Also, the Pantanal, the world&#x27;s largest wetland of any kind, has some of its area in Bolivia.

Despite the fact that eastern Bolivia is described as lowland there are some mountains and mountain ranges well beyond the Andes. The most notable of these mountains are the forested Serranías Chiquitanas in eastern Santa Cruz Department.

== Climate ==

Bolivia has several geographical areas and climates, and the three predominant ones are Andean (28% of the territory), sub-Andean (13%), and plains (59%). The climate of Bolivia, especially temperature, is strongly influenced by surface elevation. The climate of Bolivia varies drastically from one ecoregion to the other, from the tropics in the eastern &quot;llanos&quot; to polar climates in the western Andes. The summers are warm, humid in the east and dry in the west, with rains that often modify temperatures, humidity, winds, atmospheric pressure and evaporation, giving place to very different climates. When the climatological phenomenon known as&quot; El Niño&quot; takes place, it provokes great alterations in the weather. Winters are very cold in the west, and it snows around the mountain ranges, while in the western regions, windy days are more usual. The autumn is dry in the non-tropical regions.

* &quot;Llanos&quot;. A humid tropical climate with an average temperature of . The wind coming from the Amazon rainforest causes significant rainfall. Starting in May, there is low precipitation because of dry winds, and most days have clear skies. Even so, winds from the south, called &quot;surazos&quot;, can bring cooler temperatures lasting several days. Precipitation in these areas ranges from 1,100mm to 2,000mm per year, with some areas bordering the Southwestern Amazonian moist forests receiving up to 3,000mm per year.
* &quot;Chiquitanía&quot;. A humid tropical climate with an average temperature of . The wind coming from the Amazon rainforest causes considerable rainfall, with a short but noticeable dry season typically starting in May. &quot;Surazos&quot; can bring cooler temperatures lasting several days. Precipitation in these areas ranges from 750mm to 1,500mm per year, with remote areas in central eastern Santa Cruz receiving up to 2,000mm per year.
* &quot;Selva&quot;. A humid tropical climate with an average temperature of . The Southwestern Bands of the Amazon rainforest for the central and northwestern areas of Bolivia, where temperatures are hot for a majority of the year, with slightly milder winters. Precipitation in these areas ranges from 2,000mm to 4,000mm per year, with some areas around Tunari receiving up to 7,000mm per year.
* &quot;Humid Altiplano&quot;. Subtropical highland climate-Polar climates, with strong and cold winds. The average temperature ranges from . At night, temperatures descend drastically to slightly above , while during the day, the weather is dry and solar radiation is high. Ground frosts occur every month, and snow is frequent. Precipitation in these areas ranges between 450mm to 1,300mm per year, with local areas in Lake Titicaca receiving up to 2,000mm per year.
* &quot;Dry Altiplano&quot;. Desert-Polar climates, with strong and cold winds. The average temperature ranges from . At night, temperatures descend drastically to slightly above , while during the day, the weather is dry and solar radiation is high. Ground frosts occur every month, and snow is frequent. Precipitation in these areas ranges from 50mm to 400mm per year.
* Temperate Valleys and Yungas. Temperate climate. The humid northeastern winds are pushed to the mountains, making this region very humid and rainy. Temperatures are cooler at higher elevations. Snow occurs at altitudes of 2,000 meters. Precipitation in these areas ranges from 600mm to 2,000mm per year.
* Xeric Valleys. Semiarid climate. The wind shadows created by the steep Bolivian central highlands make these regions dry for much of the year, with bursts of precipitation in summer thunderstorms. Temperatures are cooler at higher elevations. Precipitation in these areas ranges from 350mm to 600mm per year.
* &quot;Chaco&quot;. Subtropical Semi-arid climate. Rain and humidity in January and the rest of the year, with warm days and cool nights. Precipitation in these areas ranges from 450mm to 1,500mm per year.

== Location and extreme points ==
Bolivia is bordered in the northwest by Peru, and in the southwest by Chile; both Peru and Bolivia are split by the Andes Mountains roughly from north to south, and those two countries therefore have very similar geographic regions, except that Bolivia&#x27;s Pacific coast was lost to Chile during the War of the Pacific in 1880. Bolivia is also bordered by Brazil in the north and east, by Paraguay in the southeast, and by Argentina in the south.

*Easternmost point – on the border with Brazil, Germán Busch Province, Santa Cruz Department
* Highest point – Nevado Sajama: 6,542 m
* Lowest point – Rio paraguay: 90 m

==Climate policy==

Bolivia has also implemented the Bolivian Strategy on Climate Change, which is based on taking action in these four areas:

# Promoting clean development in Bolivia by introducing technological changes in the agriculture, forestry, and industrial sectors, aimed to reduce GHG emissions with a positive impact on development.
# Contributing to carbon management in forests, wetlands and other managed natural ecosystems.
# Increasing effectiveness in energy supply and use to mitigate effects of GHG emissions and risk of contingencies.
# Focus on increased and efficient observations, and understanding of environmental changes in Bolivia to develop effective and timely responses.
Bolivia comprises about 20% of the world&#x27;s tropical glaciers, along with the Andes Mountains. However, they are vulnerable to global warming and have lost 43% of their surface area between 1986 and 2014. Some Bolivian glaciers have lost more than two-thirds of their mass since the 1980s points out UNESCO in 2018. While the temperature in the tropical Andes is expected to rise by two to five degrees by the end of the 21st century, glaciers would still lose between 78% and 97% of their mass. Glaciers account for between 60% and 85% of La Paz&#x27;s water supply, depending on the year.
Scientists began alerting the Bolivian government to the problem of melting glaciers in the 1990s, but it was not until 2012 that the authorities responded with real protection policies. A Project for Adaptation to the Impact of Accelerated Glacier Recession in the Tropical Andes (PRAA) was then set up, with the mission to &quot;strengthen the monitoring network&quot; and &quot;generate information useful for decision-making.&quot; The glaciers have since been monitored by cameras, probes, drones and satellite. Authorities have also developed programs to educate the population about the consequences of global warming to push back on certain harmful agricultural practices.

In February 2017, the government mobilized $200 million to combat drought and global warming.

<text>The demographic characteristics of the population of [[Bolivia]] are known from censuses, with the first census undertaken in 1826 and the most recent in 2024. The National Institute of Statistics of Bolivia (INE) has performed this task since 1950. The population of Bolivia in 2024 reached 11 million for the first time in history. The population density is 11.36 inhabitants per square kilometer, and the overall life expectancy in Bolivia at birth is 68.2 years. The population has steadily risen from the late 1800s to the present time. The natural growth rate of the population is positive, which has been a continuing trend since the 1950s; in 2012, Bolivia&#x27;s birth rate continued to be higher than the death rate. Bolivia is in the third stage of demographic transition. In terms of age structure, the population is dominated by the 15–64 segment. The median age of the population is 23.1, and the gender ratio of the total population is 0.99 males per female.

Bolivia is inhabited mostly by Mestizo, Quechua and Aymara, while minorities include 37 indigenous groups (0.3% average per group). Spanish, Quechua, Aymara, Guarani languages, as well as 34 other native languages are the official languages of Bolivia. Spanish is the most-spoken language (60.7%) within the population. The main religions of Bolivia are the Catholic Church (81.8%), Evangelicalism (11.5%), and Protestantism (2.6%). There is a literacy rate of 91.2%. An estimated 7.6% of the country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) is spent on education. The average monthly household income was Bs.1,378 ($293) in 1994. In December 2013 the unemployment rate was 3.2% of the working population. The average urbanization rate in Bolivia is 67%.

==Population size and structure==

The first true estimate of the population of Bolivia came in 1826, in which 997,427 inhabitants were estimated. This number was calculated from the 1796 census organized by Francisco Gil de Taboada, which consisted of several Bolivian cities. The first modern census was completed in 1831, and ten have been completed since then. The organizer of Bolivia&#x27;s censuses has changed throughout the years—Andrés de Santa Cruz (1831), The Bolivian Statistical Office (1835, 1854, 1882), The Bolivian Statistical Commission (1845), The National Immigration Bureau and The Statistics and Geographic Propaganda (1900), and The Department of Statistics and Censuses (1950)—with the INE conducting the census since 1976. The national census is supposed to be conducted every ten years, however, the 2012 census was late because of &quot;climatic factors and the financing.&quot; The 2012 census was conducted on 21 November 2012, in which 10,027,254 inhabitants were in the country. The estimated cost of the census was $50 million.

With a population of 10.0 million in 2012, Bolivia ranks 87th in the world by population. Its population density is 9.13 inhabitants per square kilometer. The overall life expectancy in Bolivia is 65.4. The total fertility rate is 2.87 children per mother. Since 1950, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the birth rate exceeded the death rate of the country. The population of Bolivia has been increasing since 1900, and has only had a negative per annum growth rate twice in its history (1835 and 1882). Bolivia is in the third stage of demographic transition. There were 562,461 immigrants in Bolivia in 2012, with the most (40.5%) coming from Argentina. In 2008, there were 48,809 marriages in Bolivia, and 5,887 divorces throughout the country in 2011.

==Ethnic groups==


According to a genetic study done on Bolivians, average values of Native American, European and African ancestry are 86%, 12.5%, and 1.5%, in individuals from La Paz and 76.8%, 21.4%, and 1.8% in individuals from Chuquisaca; respectively.
The vast majority of Bolivians are mestizo (with the indigenous component higher than the European one), although the government has not included the cultural self-identification &quot;mestizo&quot; in the November 2012 census. There are approximately three dozen native groups totaling approximately half of the Bolivian population – the largest proportion of indigenous people in the Americas. Exact numbers vary based on the wording of the ethnicity question and the available response choices. For example, the 2001 census did not provide the racial category &quot;mestizo&quot; as a response choice, resulting in a much higher proportion of respondents identifying themselves as belonging to one of the available indigenous ethnicity choices. Mestizos are distributed throughout the entire country and make up 26% of the Bolivian population, with the predominantly mestizo departments being Beni, Santa Cruz, and Tarija. Most people assume their &quot;mestizo&quot; identity while at the same time identifying themselves with one or more indigenous cultures. A 2018 estimate of racial classification put mestizo (mixed white and Amerindian) at 68%, indigenous at 20%, white at 5%, cholo at 2%, black at 1%, other at 4%, while 2% were unspecified; 44% attributed themselves to some indigenous group, predominantly the linguistic categories of Quechuas or Aymaras. White Bolivians comprised about 14% of the population in 2006, and are usually concentrated in the largest cities: La Paz, Santa Cruz de la Sierra and Cochabamba, but as well in some minor cities like Tarija and Sucre. The ancestry of whites and the white ancestry of mestizos lies most notably Spain, Italy, Germany, and Croatia. In the Santa Cruz Department, there are several dozen colonies of German-speaking Mennonites from Russia totaling around 40,000 inhabitants ().

Afro-Bolivians, descendants of African slaves who arrived in the time of the Spanish Empire, inhabit the department of La Paz, and are located mainly in the provinces of Nor Yungas and Sud Yungas. Slavery was abolished in Bolivia in 1831. There are also important communities of Japanese (14,000) and Lebanese (12,900).

Indigenous peoples, also called &quot;originarios&quot; (&quot;native&quot; or &quot;original&quot;) and less frequently, &quot;Amerindians&quot;, could be categorized by geographic area, such as Andean, like the Aymaras and Quechuas (who formed the ancient Inca Empire), who are concentrated in the western departments of La Paz, Potosí, Oruro, Cochabamba and Chuquisaca. There also are ethnic populations in the east, composed of the Chiquitano, Chané, Guaraní and Moxos, among others, who inhabit the departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Tarija and Pando.

There are small numbers of European citizens from Germany, France, Italy and Portugal, as well as from other countries of the Americas, as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, the United States, Paraguay, Peru, Mexico and Venezuela, among others. There are important Peruvian colonies in La Paz, El Alto and Santa Cruz de la Sierra.

There are around 140,000 Mennonites in Bolivia of Friesian, Flemish and German ethnic origins.

A few Bolivians carry some Middle Eastern ancestry, mainly from Syria &amp; Lebanon.

=== Indigenous peoples ===

The Indigenous peoples of Bolivia can be divided into two categories of ethnic groups: the Andeans, who are located in the Andean Altiplano and the valley region; and the lowland groups, who inhabit the warm regions of central and eastern Bolivia, including the valleys of Cochabamba Department, the Amazon Basin areas of northern La Paz Department, and the lowland departments of Beni, Pando, Santa Cruz, and Tarija (including the Gran Chaco region in the southeast of the country). Large numbers of Andean peoples have also migrated to form Quechua, Aymara, and intercultural communities in the lowlands.

*Andean ethnicities
** Aymara people. They live on the high plateau of the departments of La Paz, Oruro and Potosí, as well as some small regions near the tropical flatlands.
** Quechua people. They mostly inhabit the valleys in Cochabamba and Chuquisaca. They also inhabit some mountain regions in Potosí and Oruro. They divide themselves into different Quechua nations, as the Tarabucos, Ucumaris, Chalchas, Chaquies, Yralipes, Tirinas, among others.
** Uru people
*Ethnicities of the Eastern Lowlands
** Guaraníes: made up of Guarayos, Pausernas, Sirionós, Chiriguanos, Wichí, Chulipis, Taipetes, Tobas, and Yuquis.
**Tacanas: made up of Lecos, Chimanes, Araonas, and Maropas.
**Panos: made up of Chacobos, Caripunas, Sinabos, Capuibos, and Guacanaguas.
**Aruacos: made up of Apolistas, Baures, Moxos, Chané, Movimas, Cayabayas, Carabecas, and Paiconecas (Paucanacas).
**Chapacuras: made up of Itenez (More), Chapacuras, Sansinonianos, Canichanas, Itonamas, Yuracares, Guatoses, and Chiquitanos.
**Botocudos: made up of Bororos and Otuquis.
**Zamucos: made up of Ayoreos.

==Languages==

The official languages of Bolivia are Spanish (60.7%), Quechua (21.2%), Aymara (14.6), and Guaraní (0.6%), plus another 33 native languages. Originally only Spanish, Aymara, and Quechua were the official languages until the 2009 Constitution was passed. According to the 2001 census, 60.7% of the population over six years old are able to speak Spanish and/or speaks it as a native language.

==Religion==


In a 2012 Gallup poll, 87% answered affirmatively when asked &quot;Is religion important in your daily life?&quot; Christianity is the largest religion in Bolivia, with Roman Catholicism being the largest denomination.

<doc id="69013" wikidata="Q1153571" url="?curid=69013" title="Politics of Bolivia">
<text>The politics of Bolivia takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the president is head of state, head of government and head of a diverse multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament. Both the Judiciary and the electoral branch are independent of the executive and the legislature. After the 2014 Bolivian general election, 53.1% of the seats in national parliament were held by women, a higher proportion of women than that of the population.

== History ==
The Bolivian Civil War between the Conservatives and the Liberals ended in 1899 with the latter&#x27;s victory; a liberal era began that lasted until 1920. A system of public education developed, accompanied by moderate anticlericalism: Catholicism lost its status as the only religion recognized by the State in 1906 and civil marriage was adopted in 1911. Bolivian liberalism, however, clearly lost its progressive character to coexist with the interests of the new tin fortunes (the liberal era is sometimes also considered to be the tin era, with tin production having increased considerably), landowners and the army. Inspired by the example of the Ecuadorian Liberal Revolution of 1895 led by Eloy Alfaro, a new liberalism organized itself into a republican party and expressed some social concerns against the domination of the liberal oligarchy.

== Constitution==
Bolivia&#x27;s current constitution was adopted via referendum in 2009, providing for a unitary secular state.

== Executive branch ==

The president is directly elected to a five-year term by popular vote. A candidate needs either an absolute majority or 40% and a 10-point lead to win the election. In the case that no candidate is elected in the first vote, a run-off vote elects the president from among the two candidates most voted in the first vote.

Hugo Banzer was elected president in 1997. Although no candidate had received more than 50% of the popular vote in the national election, Banzer won a congressional runoff election on 5 August 1997 after forming the so-called &quot;megacoalition&quot; with other parties. He resigned in August 2001 and was substituted by his vice president Jorge Quiroga. In August 2002, the winner of the national election Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada was chosen president by Congress, winning an 84–43 vote against popular vote runner-up Evo Morales. Elected president Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada resigned in October 2003, and was substituted by vice-president Carlos Mesa who governed the nation until his resignation in June 2005. He was replaced by chief justice of the Supreme Court Eduardo Rodríguez, acting as caretaker president. Six months later, on December 18, 2005, cocalero leader Evo Morales was elected president.

A group of MEPs acting as election observers oversaw a constitutional referendum in Bolivia that gave more power to indigenous peoples 25 January 2009. The tightly fought referendum laid out a number of key reforms such as allowing President Evo Morales to stand for re-election, state control over natural gas and limits on the size of land people can own.
=== Ministries ===
Bolivia currently has twenty-one ministries in the executive branch. The heads of these ministries form the cabinet.

== Legislative branch ==

The bicameral Plurinational Legislative Assembly consists of the Chamber of Senators (36 seats; members are elected by proportional representation from party lists to serve five-year terms) and the Chamber of Deputies (130 seats; 70 are directly elected from their districts, 63 are elected by proportional representation from party lists, and 7 are elected by indigenous peoples of most departments, to serve five-year terms).
== Judicial branch ==
The judiciary consists of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Plurinational Constitutional Court, the Judiciary Council, Agrarian and Environmental Court, and District (departmental) and lower courts.
* Plurinational Constitutional Court — rules on the constitutionality of government or court actions
* Supreme Court of Justice
* Agrarian and Environmental Court () — highest court authority in matters of agriculture and the environment
* Judiciary Council () — oversees the conduct of courts and judges, including misconduct and ethical violations
* District Courts (one in each department)
* Provincial and local courts

In October 2011, Bolivia held its first judicial elections to choose members of the national courts by popular vote. Twenty-eight elected members and twenty-eight alternates were sworn in on 3 January 2011 in Sucre.

===Plurinational Constitutional Court===
The members of the Plurinational Constitutional Court, elected in October 2011, are: Ligia Velásquez, Mirtha Camacho, Melvy Andrade, Zoraida Chanes, Gualberto Cusi, Efraín Choque, and Ruddy Flores. The elected alternate members are: Isabel Ortuño, Lidia Chipana, Mario Pacosillo, Katia López, Javier Aramayo, Miriam Pacheco, and Rommy Colque.

=== Supreme Court of Justice ===
The members of the Supreme Court of Justice, elected in October 2011, are: Maritza Suntura (La Paz Department), Jorge Isaac Von Borries Méndez (Santa Cruz), Rómulo Calle Mamani (Oruro), Pastor Segundo Mamani Villca (Potosí), Antonio Guido Campero Segovia (Tarija), Gonzalo Miguel Hurtado Zamorano (Beni), Fidel Marcos Tordoya Rivas (Cochabamba), Rita Susana Nava (Tarija), and Norka Natalia Mercado Guzmán (Pando). The elected alternate members are: William Alave (La Paz), María Arminda Ríos García (Santa Cruz), Ana Adela Quispe Cuba (Oruro), Elisa Sánchez Mamani (Potosí), Carmen Núñez Villegas (Tarija), Silvana Rojas Panoso (Beni), María Lourdes Bustamante (Cochabamba), Javier Medardo Serrano (Tarija), and Delfín Humberto Betancour Chinchilla (Pando). Gonzalo Miguel Hurtado Zamorano was elected President of the Court on 3 January 2012.

The Supreme Court of Justice replaces the Supreme Court, active since Bolivia&#x27;s founding in 1825.

=== Judiciary Council ===
The members of the Judiciary Council, elected in October 2011, are (in order of total votes received): Cristina Mamani, Freddy Sanabria, Wilma Mamani, Roger Triveño, and Ernesto Araníbar. Cristina Mamani was elected by her peers as the first president of the Judiciary Council on 4 January 2012.

=== Agro-environmental Court ===
The members of the Agro-environmental Court, elected in October 2011, are (in order of total votes received): Bernardo Huarachi, Deysi Villagómez, Gabriela Armijo Paz, Javier Peñafiel, Juan Ricardo Soto, Lucio Fuentes, and Yola Paucara. The elected alternate members are: Isabel Ortuño, Lidia Chipana, Mario Pacosillo, Katia López, Javier Aramayo, Miriam Pacheco, and Rommy Colque.

== Electoral branch ==
The electoral branch of Bolivia&#x27;s government, formally the Plurinational Electoral Organ, is an independent branch of government which replaced the National Electoral Court in 2010. The branch consists of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the nine Departmental Electoral Tribunals, Electoral Judges, the anonymously selected Juries at Election Tables, and Electoral Notaries. Wilfredo Ovando presides over the seven-member Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Its operations are mandated by the Constitution and regulated by the Electoral Regime Law (Law 026, passed 2010). The Organ&#x27;s first elections will be the country&#x27;s first judicial election in October 2011 and five municipal special elections expected to be held in 2011.

== Local government ==
Bolivia is divided into nine departments (departamentos, singular – departamento); Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, Beni, La Paz, Oruro, Pando, Potosi, Santa Cruz, Tarija. 
Bolivia&#x27;s nine departments received greater autonomy under the Administrative Decentralization law of 1995. Departmental autonomy further increased with the first popular elections for departmental governors, known as prefects, on 18 December 2005. Departments are governed by the elected governors (until 2010, prefects; and until 2005, appointed by the President) and by independently elected Departmental Legislative Assemblies (until 2010; Departmental Councils).

Bolivian cities and towns are governed by directly elected mayors and councils. Municipal elections were last held on 4 April 2010, with both mayors councils elected to five-year terms. The Popular Participation Law of April 1994, which distributes a significant portion of national revenues to municipalities for discretionary use, has enabled previously neglected communities to make striking improvements in their facilities and services.

== Political parties and elections ==
The governing Movement for Socialism (&quot;Movimiento al Socialismo&quot;, MAS) is a Left-wing, Socialist political party led by Evo Morales, founded in 1997. It has governed the country since 2006, following the first ever majority victory by a single party in the December 2005 elections. MAS evolved out of the movement to defend the interests of coca growers. Currently, the MAS stands as a party committed to equality, indigenous rights, agrarian land reform, Constitutional reform as well as nationalization of key industries with an aim to redistribute the returns through increased social spending. Among the poor, rural and indigenous population the MAS enjoys nearly unanimous support.

The right-of-center opposition includes a variety of political parties. During the 2005–09 political cycle the largest of these was PODEMOS, a successor to Nationalist Democratic Action. In the 2009 elections, several parties and politicians united to form Plan Progreso para Bolivia – Convergencia Nacional, whose presidential candidate, Manfred Reyes Villa and parliamentary slate came in second in the 2009 elections.

Three political parties were dominant from 1982 to 2005: The Revolutionary Nationalist Movement which had carried out the 1952 Revolution; Revolutionary Left Movement; and Nationalist Democratic Action founded in 1982 by former dictator and later elected President Hugo Banzer. Despite the revolutionary names of the first two, they generally pursued centrist economic policies.

Other parties include:

* Bolivian Socialist Falange or FSB – Romel Pantoja
* Civic Solidarity Union or UCS – Johnny Fernández
* Free Bolivia Movement or MBL – Franz Barrios
* Marshal of Ayacucho Institutional Vanguard or VIMA – Freddy Zabala
* Movement of the Revolutionary Left or MIR – Jaime Paz Zamora
* Movement Without Fear or MSM – Juan Del Granado
* Nationalist Democratic Action or ADN –
* Socialist Party or PS – Jerjes Justiniano

== Social movements ==
Some of Bolivia&#x27;s social movements are:
* Cocalero Groups – Evo Morales
* &quot;El Alto&quot; Social Movements Roberto De La Cruz
* indigenous organization: Aymara Indigenous Confederate Movements Felipe Quispe
* &quot;El Alto&quot; FEJUVE Abel Mamani
* labor unions
* Sole Confederation of Campesino Workers of Bolivia or CSUTCB – Roman Loayza
* Autonomic Oriental Party

<text>The economy of Bolivia is the 95th-largest in the world in nominal terms and the 87th-largest in purchasing power parity. Bolivia is classified by the World Bank to be a lower middle income country. With a Human Development Index of 0.703, it is ranked 114th (high human development). Driven largely by its natural resources, Bolivia has become a region leader in measures of economic growth, fiscal stability and foreign reserves, although it remains a historically poor country.
The Bolivian economy has had a historic single-commodity focus. From silver to tin to coca, Bolivia has enjoyed only occasional periods of economic diversification. Political instability and difficult topography have constrained efforts to modernize the agricultural sector. Similarly, relatively low population growth coupled with low life expectancy has kept the labor supply in flux and prevented industries from flourishing. Rampant inflation and corruption previously created development challenges, but in the early twenty-first century the fundamentals of its economy showed unexpected improvement, leading Moody&#x27;s Investors Service to upgrade Bolivia&#x27;s economic rating in 2010 from B2 to B1. The mining industry, especially the extraction of natural gas and zinc, currently dominates Bolivia&#x27;s export economy.

Between 2006 and 2019 (term of the presidency of the democratic socialist Evo Morales), GDP per capita doubled and the extreme poverty rate declined from 38% to 18%. The poverty rate declined from 22.23% in 2000 to 12.38% in 2010. Moreover, the Gini coefficient declined from 0.60 to 0.446. According to the Bolivian Institute of Foreign Trade, Bolivia had the lowest accumulated inflation of Latin America by October 2021.

== History ==

The Bolivian economy grew rapidly between 1960 and 1977. According to one study, &quot;persistent deficits and a fixed exchange rate policy during the 1970s led to a debt crisis that began in 1977. From 1977 to 1986, Bolivia lost almost all the gains in GDP per capita that it had achieved since 1960.&quot; After 1986, Bolivian economy began to grow again. Between 1998 and 2002, Bolivia experienced a financial crisis.

Inflation has plagued, and at times crippled, the Bolivian economy since the 1970s. At one time in 1985 Bolivia experienced an annual inflation rate of more than 20,000 percent. Fiscal and monetary reform reduced the inflation rate to single digits by the 1990s, and in 2004 Bolivia experienced a manageable 4.9 percent rate of inflation.
A major blow to the Bolivian economy came with a drastic fall in the price of tin during the early 1980s, which impacted one of Bolivia&#x27;s main sources of income and one of its major mining industries.

Since 1985 the government of Bolivia has implemented a far-reaching program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform aimed at maintaining price stability, creating conditions for sustained growth, and alleviating scarcity. A major reform of the customs service has significantly improved transparency in this area. Parallel legislative reforms have locked into place market-liberal policies, especially in the hydrocarbon and telecommunication sectors, that have encouraged private investment. Foreign investors are accorded national treatment.

In April 2000 Hugo Banzer, the former president of Bolivia, signed a contract with Aguas del Tunari, a private consortium, to operate and improve the water supply in Bolivia&#x27;s third-largest city, Cochabamba. Shortly thereafter, the company tripled the water rates in that city, an action which resulted in protests and rioting among those who could no longer afford clean water. Amidst Bolivia&#x27;s nationwide economic collapse and growing national unrest over the state of the economy, the Bolivian government was forced to withdraw the water contract.

Once Bolivia&#x27;s government depended heavily on foreign assistance to finance development projects and to pay the public staff. At the end of 2002, the government owed $4.5 billion to its foreign creditors, with $1.6 billion of this amount owed to other governments and most of the balance owed to multilateral development banks. Most payments to other governments have been rescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the Paris Club mechanism. External creditors have been willing to do this because the Bolivian government has generally achieved the monetary and fiscal targets set by IMF programs since 1987, though economic crises have undercut Bolivia&#x27;s normally good record. However, by 2013 the foreign assistance is just a fraction of the government budget thanks to tax collection mainly from the profitable exports to Brazil and Argentina of natural gas.
Parallel legislative reforms have locked into place market-oriented policies, especially in the hydrocarbon and telecommunication sectors, that have encouraged private investment. Foreign investors are accorded national treatment, and foreign ownership of companies enjoys virtually no restrictions in Bolivia. While the capitalization program was successful in vastly boosting foreign direct investment (FDI) in Bolivia (US$7 billion in stock during 1996–2002), FDI later decreased as investors completed their capitalization contract obligations.

In 1996 three units of the Bolivian state oil corporation (YPFB) involved in hydrocarbon exploration, production, and transportation were capitalized, facilitating the construction of a gas pipeline to Brazil. The government has a long-term sales agreement to sell 30 million cubic metres a day (MMcmd) of natural gas to Brazil through 2019. The Brazil pipeline carried about 21 MMcmd in 2000. Bolivia has the second-largest natural gas reserves in South America, and its current domestic use and exports to Brazil account for just a small portion of its potential production. Natural gas exports to Argentina resumed in 2004 at four MMcmd.

In April 2000 violent protests over plans to privatize the water utility in the city of Cochabamba led to nationwide disturbances. The government eventually cancelled the contract without compensation to the investors, returning the utility to public control. The foreign investors in this project pursued an investment dispute case against Bolivia for its actions. A similar situation occurred in 2005 in the cities of El Alto and La Paz.

Protest and widespread opposition to exporting gas through Chile led to the resignation of President Sanchez de Lozada in October 2003. The government held a binding referendum in 2004 on plans to export natural gas and on hydrocarbons law reform. By May 2005, the carbons law draft was being considered by the Senate.

According to the data of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, as well as several international Institutes such as ECLAC, during the period 2006 to 2019 (period of the presidency of Evo Morales and Alvaro Garcia Linera) the economy of Bolivia quadrupled from a value of 9,573 million dollars to 42,401 million dollars, this is due in large part to the policy of nationalization of Natural Resources, the stability of the exchange rate, the incentive of the domestic market, strong public investment in infrastructure and industrialization of natural resources such as gas and lithium. Similarly, according to studies by the World Bank and ECLAC, during the period 2006–2019, Bolivia experienced a marked reduction in poverty and extreme poverty, resulting in a reduction of the population living in extreme poverty from 38.2% to 15.2%. In terms of HDI, according to the UNDP World Human Development Report, Bolivia in 2018 for the first time became classified as a &quot;high human development Country&quot;, reaching an HDI indicator of 0.703 and rising to the 114th position of 189 countries and territories.

==Macroeconomy==

===Main indicators===
Bolivia&#x27;s 2016 gross domestic product referred to PPP totaled $78.35 billion and in the official exchange $35.69 billion. Its standard of living, as measured in GDP in PPP per capita was US$7,191. Economic growth was about 5.2% a year and inflation was 4.5% in 2012. Bolivia experienced a budget surplus of about 1.5% of GDP in 2012. Expenditures were nearly US$12.2 billion while revenues amounted to about US$12.6 billion. The government runs surplus accounts since 2005.

The Bolivian currency is the boliviano (ISO 4217: BOB; symbol: Bs.) One boliviano is divided into 100 centavos. The boliviano replaced the Bolivian peso at a rate of one million to one in 1987 after many years of rampant inflation. At that time, 1 new boliviano was roughly equivalent to 1 U.S. dollar. At the end of 2011 the boliviano was only worth around 0.145 U.S. Dollar. Annual interest rates in 2010 had decreased steadily to 9.9 percent from more than 50 percent before 1997.

Bolivia&#x27;s human development index was reported at 0.675, comprising a health index of 0.740, an education index of 0.743 and a GNI index of 0.530, ranking within the group of medium human development. &quot;Between 1980 and 2012 Bolivia (Plurinational State of)&#x27;s HDI rose by 1.3% annually from 0.489 to 0.675 today, which gives the country a rank of 108 out of 187 countries with comparable data. The HDI of Latin America and the Caribbean as a region increased from 0.574 in 1980 to 0.741 today, placing Bolivia (Plurinational State of) below the regional average.&quot;

The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2023 (with IMF staff estimates for 2024–2028). Inflation below 5% is in green. 

==Sectors==

===Primary sector===
====Agriculture and forestry====

Agriculture, forestry, and fishing accounted for 14 percent of Bolivia&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003, down from 28 percent in 1986. Combined, these activities employ nearly 44 percent of Bolivia&#x27;s workers. Most agricultural workers are engaged in subsistence farming—the dominant economic activity of the highlands region. Agricultural production in Bolivia is complicated by both the country&#x27;s topography and climate. High elevations make farming difficult, as do the El Niño weather patterns and seasonal flooding. Bolivia&#x27;s agricultural GDP continues to rise but has attained only a rather modest average growth rate of 2.8 percent annually since 1991.

Bolivia&#x27;s most lucrative agricultural product continues to be coca, of which Bolivia is currently the world&#x27;s third largest cultivator after Colombia and Peru, with an estimated 29,500 hectares under cultivation in 2007, slightly higher than the previous year. Bolivia is the third-largest producer of cocaine, a drug produced from coca, estimated at 120 metric tons potential pure cocaine in 2007 and a transit country for Peruvian and Colombian cocaine destined illegally for the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Paraguay. The Bolivian government, in response to international pressure, worked to restrict coca cultivation. However, eradication efforts have hampered by the lack of a suitable replacement crop for rural communities that have cultivated coca for generations. The Morales government turned back some of the results which was obtained in previous years.

Since 2001 Bolivia&#x27;s leading legal agricultural export has been soybeans. Additionally, cotton, coffee, and sugarcane have been viable exports for Bolivia. For domestic consumption, corn, wheat, and potatoes are the crops of choice of Bolivian farmers. Despite its vast forests, Bolivia has only a minor timber industry. In 2003 timber accounted for only 3.5 percent of export earnings. The Forestry Law of 1996 imposed a tax on sawn lumber and consequently cut Bolivian lumber exports significantly. The tax was used to establish the Forestry Stewardship Council, which has been only minimally successful in forest restoration efforts and eliminating illegal logging. With increased efficiency, Bolivia could likely expand the profitability of its forest resources, while still protecting them from overexploitation. Bolivia has a small fishing industry that taps the country&#x27;s freshwater lakes and streams. The annual catch averages about 6,000 tons.

In 2018, Bolivia produced 9.6 million tons of sugarcane, 2.9 million tons of soy, 1.2 million tons of maize, 1.1 million tons of potato, 1 million tons of sorghum, 700 thousand tons of banana, 541 thousand tons of rice, 301 thousand tons of wheat, in addition to smaller yields of other agricultural products, such as tangerine, cassava, orange, beans, sunflower seed, cotton etc.

Agriculture and forestry is also the lifeline for multitudes of small villages which house a majority of the population. Small village economy stumbled and dwindled from the late twentieth century due to aggravating environmental problems including deforestation and consequent soil degradation, water pollution, loss of biodiversity, and so on. Besides, political and social problems also greatly obstruct the growth of small village development: political turmoil, post-civil war predicament and burgeoning fiscal deficit have strangled most investment incentives; corruption and manipulation of water supply by foreign companies have greatly undermined the availability and efficiency of local market, leaving little profits for village farmers and producers. Furthermore, the global market poses a threat to the stability and sustainability of Bolivia&#x27;s frail economy: &quot;a drop in export prices, reduction of informal trade&quot; and low-skilled over-homogenized local products have further worsened the bleak condition of Bolivia&#x27;s microeconomic activities, making it almost impossible for village farms and factories to make a living from trading with the world. Dwindling profits and surging cost of production have made small village economy in Bolivia extremely vulnerable and unstable; as a result, unemployment increases and small business is on the verge of bankruptcy, which in return made government intervention very inefficient and deferred many governmental initiatives and attempts to improve the condition.

====Mining====

In 2019, the country was the 8th largest world producer of silver; 4th largest world producer of boron; 5th largest world producer of antimony; 5th largest world producer of tin; 6th largest world producer of tungsten; 7th largest producer of zinc, and the 8th largest producer of lead.

Mining continues to be vital to Bolivia&#x27;s economy. The collapse of the world tin market in the 1980s led to a restructuring of the industry. The state dramatically reduced its control and presently operates only a small portion of mining activities. Small-scale operations, often with low productivity, employ many former state miners. Natural gas has supplanted tin and silver as the country&#x27;s most valuable natural commodity. A discovery in 1997 confirmed a tenfold gain in Bolivia&#x27;s known natural gas reserves. Finding markets to utilize this resource, both domestically and internationally, has been slowed by a lack of infrastructure and conflicts over the state&#x27;s role in controlling natural resources. Although the world tin market has re-emerged, Bolivia now faces stiff competition from Southeast Asian countries producing lower-cost alluvial tin. Gold and silver production has increased dramatically over the past decade. Annually, as of 2002 Bolivia extracted and exported more than 11,000 kilograms of gold and 461 tons of silver. Additionally, Bolivia has increased zinc production, extracting more than 100,000 tons each year. Other metals excavated include antimony, iron, and tungsten.

Most of Bolivia&#x27;s gas comes from megafields located in San Alberto, San Antonio, Margarita, and Incahuasi. These areas are in the territory of the indigenous Guarani people, and the region is frequently viewed as a remote backwater by non-residents.

=====Lithium=====

According to the United States Geological Survey, Bolivia has 9 million tons of lithium, which can be used to make lithium batteries, used in hybrid and electric vehicles in addition to huge numbers of smaller batteries. At 14.5%, this is the second-largest known concentration of lithium in any country; Argentina has 14.8 million known tons of lithium, Chile has 8.5 million tons, Australia has 7.7 million tons, and the United States has 6.8 million tons. These large deposits are located in desert regions farmed by indigenous groups, who claim their share of the profits made from their natural resources. Bolivian President Evo Morales favored national, rather than foreign, ownership of natural resources, and nationalized the country&#x27;s oil and natural gas reserves.

Mining the mineral deposits would involve disturbing the country&#x27;s salt flats (called Salar de Uyuni), an important natural feature which boosts tourism in the region. The government does not want to destroy this unique natural landscape to meet the rising world demand for lithium.

In January 2013 Bolivia opened a lithium production plant in Uyuni, producing mainly potassium chloride. Also, the Bolivian government signed intentions to develop not only lithium extraction but also lithium-ion battery production with numerous countries, especially from the Asia Pacific region.

In 2019, Bolivia had signed a deal with German firm ACISA to develop a joint partnership with the Bolivian state-owned YLB for developing extraction and processing of lithium at Salar de Uyuni. The deal was later cancelled after long-running protests by locals over the perceived lack of local benefits and royalties of the project. Bolivia&#x27;s state lithium YLB also created a joint venture together with the Chinese Xinjiang TBEA Group to explore extraction of lithium and other materials from the Coipasa and Pastos Grandes salt flats.
It is thought that due to the importance of lithium for batteries for electric vehicles and stabilization of electric grids with large proportions of intermittent renewables in the electricity mix, Bolivia could be strengthened geopolitically. However, this perspective has also been criticized for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production in other parts of the world.

===Industry and manufacturing===
Annually, manufacturing accounted for in approximately 18% of Bolivia&#x27;s gross domestic product between 1995 and 2005. The share of industry as a whole (including the mining industry) to the GDP increased from 30 percent in 2000 to 37.3 percent in 2010. Most industry is a small-scale, aimed at regional markets rather than national operations. Inadequate credit options and competition from the black market have kept Bolivia&#x27;s manufacturing sector from developing fully. Leading manufactured goods in Bolivia include textiles, clothing, non-durable consumer goods, processed soya, refined metals, and refined petroleum.

Processing of food, beverages and tobacco is the biggest sector within the manufacturing industry (39% in 2001). This sector occupies a prominent place in the manufacturing industry that is continually growing, both in production and number of businesses and jobs. In 2010 its share in exports was about 14%. Especially the soybean and its derivatives reached very large export markets in recent years. The largest factories producing soybeans, sunflower seeds, cotton and sugar from sugar cane, are mainly situated in Santa Cruz, although a large edible oil refineries operate in Cochabamba. All major cities have at least one brewery, one or more soft drink bottling plants, and one or more packaging plants for canned food.. There has been some growth in publicly owned manufacturing during the presidency of Luis Arce, with Bolivia opening an açai berry processing plant in 2021.

The textiles industry was the second largest manufacturing sector after the food industry in the 1970s and was of decreasing importance afterwards, representing progressively diminishing value of total manufacturing. But since the 1990s the textile industry has increased its growth rate. The cotton and wool industry declined at the expense of synthetic fibers. The largest concentration of textile mills are to be found in La Paz, but also in Santa Cruz and Cochabamba and to a lesser extent in Oruro.

Another important industry is the oil refining industry.

===Services===
The services industry in Bolivia remains undeveloped. Inhabiting one of the poorest countries in South America, Bolivians have weak purchasing power. The retail sector suffers from weak demand and competition with a large black market of contraband goods. U.S. companies such as McDonald&#x27;s and Domino&#x27;s have pulled out of Bolivia in recent years.
====Banking and finance====
Banking in Bolivia has long suffered from corruption and weak regulation. However, a series of reforms initiated by the 1993 Banking Law and subsequent acts are gradually improving Bolivia&#x27;s banking sector. Bolivia has a central bank and nine private banks. Consolidation occurred following reforms, lowering the number of private banks in Bolivia from 14 in 1995 to nine in 2003. Foreign participation and investment in Bolivian banks are allowed. About 90 percent of Bolivian bank deposits are held in U.S. dollars. The Bolivian government is trying to change this situation by taxing dollarized accounts while exempting boliviano accounts from the tax. As recently as 2002, 27 percent of all loans were non-performing, leading most foreign investors to focus their resources in the somewhat-safer venue of corporate lending. Most bank lending in 2003 went to manufacturing (24 percent), followed by property services (18 percent) and trade and retail (16 percent). Bad debt remains at a historically high level. Further reforms are necessary, including the pending act to introduce a deposit guarantee system. Bolivia&#x27;s stock market expanded in 1998 to include corporate bonds, along with the money market and government bond options that had existed previously. The privatization of Bolivia&#x27;s social security program has bolstered the stock market.
====Tourism====

Bolivia&#x27;s spectacular vistas and natural attractions have not been enough to transform the country into a major tourist destination because of its political instability and lack of first-class accommodations. Still, Bolivia&#x27;s tourist industry has grown gradually over the past 15 years. In 2000 Bolivia attracted 306,000 tourists, compared with 254,000 in 1990. Tourist revenue peaked at US$179 million in 1999. Tourism in Bolivia declined following the 11 September 2001 attack on the United States, as was the case across North and South America. Since from 2001 the tourism sector, however, is strongly increasing, in fact in 2018 the number of tourists reached 1.142,000 arrivals.

==Infrastructure==
===Energy===
Bolivia&#x27;s energy needs are relatively small but growing consistently. Bolivia uses oil for the majority of its power needs, followed by natural gas and hydroelectric power.

====Oil====
Bolivia has estimated oil reserves of , the fifth largest in South America. The fields are located in the east and south. The main activities in the refineries is crude oil fractioning, catalytic conversion for high octane gasoline, and refining of heavy fractions to produce lubricants. The final products are vehicle gasoline, liquid propane and butane, jet fuel, diesel oil and lubricants for use in industrial machinery. As domestic oil production is insufficient to meet domestic demand Bolivia is a net importer of oil.

Until recently the country&#x27;s oil industry was fully controlled by the state company YPFB, established in 1936 with the mission to develop, refine and distribute oil resources. After privatization efforts in the 1990s the transport of natural gas and oil was in private hands during the 1990s while the production and refining of materials was part of risk-sharing contracts between the government and private investors. In 1999 the refineries were also completely privatized. In May 2006 president Evo Morales re-nationalized reserves, while its exploitation remained in private hands.
====Natural gas====

The country&#x27;s natural gas reserves total according to Bolivian government figures, ranking Bolivia behind only Venezuela in terms of proven natural gas reserves in South America. Additionally, Bolivia is self-sufficient in its energy production. The sector changed significantly when the government allowed privatization in the mid-1990s. International companies quickly invested in Bolivian energy sources, particularly in natural gas, and made Bolivia into a player in the world energy market. The exportation of Bolivian energy resources, while potentially lucrative economically, has been politically hazardous. President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada ultimately resigned over his plan to export natural gas to the United States and Mexico in 2003.

On 6 June 2005, former president Carlos Mesa offered his resignation to the Bolivian Congress after months of demonstrations by Bolivia&#x27;s indigenous population calling for renationalizing the natural gas and oil sectors. Mesa had increased taxation on foreign companies while still encouraging their investment in Bolivian energy development. On 1 May 2006, his successor, former president Morales, signed a decree stating that all natural gas reserves were to be nationalized, recovering ownership, possession and control of hydrocarbons. US Exxon Mobil Corporation, Petrobras, Spain&#x27;s Repsol YPF, UK gas and oil producer BG Group Plc, and France&#x27;s Total are the main gas companies present in the country.

Bolivia&#x27;s natural gas exports bring in millions of dollars per day, in royalties, rents and taxes. From 2007 to 2017, what is referred to as the &quot;government take&quot; on gas totaled approximately $22 billion.

====Electricity====

Until 1994 the electricity sector was dominated by the vertically integrated public utility ENDE (&quot;Empresa Nacional de Electricidad&quot;). In 1994 the electricity sector was privatized and was unbundled into generation, transmission and distribution. The law aimed to increase efficiency in the sector, promote competition and encourage investment.

The supply is dominated by thermal generation (60%), while hydropower (40%) has a smaller share in its generation mix compared to other South American countries (Latin America and the Caribbean, or LAC, average hydropower capacity is 51%). The electricity coverage in rural areas is with 30% among the lowest in Latin America and improving it represents a major challenge in the future and requires the joint efforts from both the public and private sectors. Like in other countries, Bolivia&#x27;s electricity sector consists of a National Interconnected System (SIN) and off-grid systems (known as the &quot;Aislado&quot;).

===Transportation===
===Telecommunications===
===Water supply and sanitation===

==Labor and welfare==
The economic downturn of the late 1990s, coupled with privatization and austerity efforts led by President Mesa, resulted in significant unemployment. Although the Bolivian government does not keep unemployment statistics, outside experts estimated unemployment to be between 8 and 10 percent of the population, as of 2006. Underemployment of Bolivia&#x27;s workforce of nearly 4 million is also widespread. As a result of the lack of formal employment opportunities, nearly 65 percent of the urban workforce was self-employed in 2002.

Labor unions have a strong history in Bolivia, and many workers in the formal sector belong to unions. The larger unions, such as the Bolivian Labor Federation and the Trade Union Federation of Bolivian Mine Workers, have been successful in rallying workers to countless strikes and work stoppages. Nevertheless, working conditions for most Bolivian workers are difficult.

These conditions are even more critical as far as the informal sector is concerned. In fact, Bolivia has been listed in the 2014 U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s report on child labor and forced labor among the 74 countries where instances of such practices have been observed. According to the &quot;List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor&quot; issued under this report, Bolivia resorts to these practices in the agricultural sector as well as in the mining industry until this day. The DOL has also reported that &quot;The [Bolivian] Government&#x27;s National Plan to Eradicate Child Labor expired in 2010 and has not been updated.&quot;

==Foreign economic relations==

=== Foreign exchange reserves ===
The amount in reserve currencies and gold held by Bolivia&#x27;s Central Bank advanced from 1.085 billion US dollars in 2000, under Hugo Banzer Suarez&#x27;s government, to 15.282 billion US dollars in 2014 under Evo Morales&#x27; government. By 2022, a large part of the currency reserves had been used up, at which point they still stood at just under US$3.8 billion. In the course of 2023, they fell to less than US$500 million, with the country facing a liquidity crisis.

===Trade agreements===
Bolivia&#x27;s trade with neighboring countries is growing, in part because of several regional preferential trade agreements it has negotiated. Bolivia was a founding member of the Andean Group, a South American organization designed to promote trade among Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Subsequently renamed the Andean Community, the organization has succeeded in increasing intra-South American trade. Trade among member countries rose from US$3.6 billion in 1991 to US$10.3 billion in 2003. Bolivia also belongs to the Common Market of the South (Mercado Común del Sur—Mercosur). Bolivia became an associate member in March 1997 to open investment opportunities with the founding Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), as well as other Mercosur associate members (Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela). The agreement provides for the gradual creation of a free trade area covering at least 80% of the trade between the parties over a 10-year period, though economic crises in the region have derailed progress at integration. The U.S. Andean Trade Preference and Drug Enforcement Act (ATPDEA) allows (allowed?) numerous Bolivian products to enter the United States free of duty on a unilateral basis, including alpaca and llama products and, subject to a quota, cotton textiles. Bolivia conducted more than US$1 billion in trade with Mercosur countries in 2003. As a result of negotiations initiated in 1999 on a possible South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA), Mercosur and the Andean Community of Nations announced in December 2004 that they would merge, creating a Union of South American Nations modeled after the European Union.

===Imports and exports===
Bolivian tariffs are low; however, manufacturers complain that the tax-rebate program that allows some companies to claim refunds of import taxes on capital equipment is inefficient, with many companies now owed millions of dollars by the Bolivian Government, which can take years to recover.
Bolivian imports of goods were valued at about US$6.52 billion in 2020, while service imports were valued at about US$2.55 billion in 2019.

Bolivia enjoyed an estimated $500 million goods trade surplus in 2020. Leading sources of Bolivian imports include China, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Argentina, with its top imports refined petroleum, cars, pesticides, delivery trucks, and raw iron bars.

Bolivian exports of goods and services in 2020 stood at US$7.02 billion compared with US$1.9 billion in 2003.

Increased production of hydrocarbons, especially natural gas, led Bolivia&#x27;s trade upturn in 2004. A 20-year supply contract with Brazil for natural gas, ending in 2019, the necessary capital to increase production. In 2004 export revenues for natural gas topped US$619 million. Bolivia also exported significant quantities of petroleum. Beyond hydrocarbons, other significant exports included zinc, soya, iron ore, and tin. In 2001 Brazil overtook the United States as Bolivia&#x27;s primary export outlet. Switzerland, Venezuela, and Colombia are also important export partners. Bolivia has actively sought to foster economic connections in South America after long relying on the United States as its primary trade partner.

The United States remains one of Bolivia&#x27;s largest trading partners; however, it faded greatly on Brazil benefit in 2012. In 2002, the United States exported $283 million of merchandise to Bolivia and imported $162 million. Bolivia&#x27;s major exports to the United States are tin, gold, jewelry, and wood products. Its major imports from the United States are computers, vehicles, wheat, and machinery. A Bilateral Investment Treaty between the United States and Bolivia came into effect in 2001, however the Treaty was terminated by the government of Bolivia in 2012.

By 2004 Bolivia had become the market leader in the export of brazil nuts, with thousands of local people involved in collecting the pods in Bolivian Amazonia.

===Balance of trade===
Bolivia had an estimated trade surplus of more than US$1.6 billion in 2011. This figure represents a marked change in Bolivia&#x27;s economic balance sheet. Bolivia reached a peak trade deficit of US$888 million in 1998 before increased hydrocarbon exports radically altered the situation.

Bolivia had a large negative balance of payments for 2002⎯US$317 million. However, this situation has been remedied by the vast increase in export revenue. Estimates for the balance of payments for 2004 show a record surplus of US$126 million. Bolivia&#x27;s external debt totaled an estimated US$5.7 billion in 2004. The International Monetary Fund has assisted Bolivia in paying down this debt. In 1995 the United States, among other countries, reduced Bolivia&#x27;s debt by two-thirds.

===Foreign investment===
Foreign investment in Bolivia was buoyed in 1995 by privatization. Investment in mining and natural gas extraction increased, as did investment in the banking sector. However, the economic decline of the late 1990s, along with political unrest, caused foreign investors to pull out of Bolivia once again. In 2000 foreign investors contributed US$736 million to the Bolivian economy. In 2002 this total fell to US$676 million.

The Government of Bolivia remains heavily dependent on foreign assistance to finance development projects. At the end of 2002, the government owed $4.5 billion to its foreign creditors, with $1.6 billion of this amount owed to other governments and most of the balance owed to multilateral development banks. Most payments to other governments have been rescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the Paris Club mechanism. External creditors have been willing to do this because the Bolivian Government has generally achieved the monetary targets set by International Monetary Fund programs since 1987, though economic problems in recent years have undercut Bolivia&#x27;s normally good track record. Rescheduling agreements granted by the Paris Club have allowed the individual creditor countries to apply very soft terms to the rescheduled debt. As a result, some countries have forgiven substantial amounts of Bolivia&#x27;s bilateral debt. The U.S. Government reached an agreement at the Paris Club meeting in December 1995 that reduced by 67% Bolivia&#x27;s existing debt stock. The Bolivian Government continues to pay its debts to the multilateral development banks on time. Bolivia is a beneficiary of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC debt relief programs, which by agreement restricts Bolivia&#x27;s access to new soft loans. Bolivia was one of three countries in the Western hemisphere selected for eligibility for the Millennium Challenge Account and is participating as an observer in free trade agreement negotiations. Bolivia enjoys some financial assistance programs run by the World Bank and Microenterprise Development programs provided by Five Talents International.

====Mutun iron ore project====
In 2007, India&#x27;s third-largest steel manufacturer, Jindal Steel and Power Limited, signed a contract with the Bolivian government to exploit the Mutun iron ore deposit, considered to be one of the largest in the world. According to the contract, Jindal would invest US$1.5 billion initially and an additional US$2.5 billion over the next eight years. This is the single largest investment by an Indian firm in Latin America. Jindal Steel will set up an integrated 1.7 MTPA steel plant, a 6 MTPA sponge iron plant, a 10 MTPA iron ore pellet plant and a 450 MW power plant. By September 2011, Jindal had obtained clearance for the project from the EIA and had hired an engineering consultant for FEED work. The project is expected to create 6,000 jobs directly and another 15,000 indirectly.

As of June 2011, Jindal had invested only US$20 million on the project due to considerable delay by Bolivian authorities in issuing land for the project and due to inability of the Bolivian government to commit 8 million cubic meters of natural gas per day for the power plant and ore smelting process. In 2012 Jindal exited Bolivia, prompting Bolivia to seize the bond. In 2014, international arbitration awarded Jindal $22.5 Million due to Bolivia&#x27;s seizure of the bond.

<text>Telecommunications in Bolivia includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.

==Radio and television==
* Radio broadcast stations: AM 171, FM 73, shortwave 77 (1999).
* Television broadcast stations: 48 (1997). 
* Bolivia has a large number of radio and TV stations broadcasting with private media outlets dominating. There has been a recent, rapid growth of state-owned media, including a network of community radios. State-owned and private radio and TV stations generally operate freely, although both pro-government and anti-government groups have attacked media outlets in response to their reporting (2010).

==Telephones==
* International calling code: 591. 
* Fixed lines: 880,600 lines in use, 80th in the world (2012).
* Mobile cellular: 9.494 million telephones, 82nd in the world (2012).
* Satellite earth stations: 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2011).

The Bolivian National Telecommunications Company was privatized in 1995 but re-nationalized in 2007; the primary trunk system is being expanded and employs digital microwave radio relay; some areas are served by fiber-optic cable; system operations, reliability, and coverage have steadily improved. Most telephones are concentrated in La Paz, Santa Cruz, and other capital cities; mobile-cellular telephone use expanding rapidly and, in 2011, teledensity reached about 80 per 100 persons.

==Internet==

* Internet hosts: 180,988 hosts, 75th in the world (2012). 
* Internet users: 3.5 million users, 75th in the world; 34% of the population, 125th in the world (2012).
* Fixed access: 111,029 subscriptions, 99th in the world; 1.1% of population, 139th in the world (2014). 
* Mobile access: 690,768 subscriptions, 83rd in the world; 6.7% of the population, 101st in the world (2014).
* Average connection speed: 1.1 Mbit/s, 54th in the world (2014).
* IPv4 addresses: 561,920 (2012).
* Top-level domain: .bo.

===Internet censorship and surveillance===

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet. The Bolivian constitution and law provide for freedom of speech and press. Although the government generally respects these rights, in at least two cases in 2012, the government used the anti-racism law to restrict both rights. Some senior government officials also verbally harassed members of the press corps. Bolivian law prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence and the government generally respects these prohibitions, but there have been allegations that the government does not always respect the law. Defamation remains a criminal offence.

* Concerns were raised over a 2010 anti-discrimination law. Its &quot;far-reaching and vague&quot; language could be used to curb and punish legitimate journalism, warned the Committee to Protect Journalists. 
* On 21 October 2012, Vice President Garcia Linera stated that the government records the names of people who insult President Morales on social media sites.
* On 23 October 2012, the Constitutional Court struck down the libel law that allowed for detention of one month to four years for a person found guilty of insulting, defaming, or slandering public officials.
* On 2016, after the Constitutional Referendum, the government considered the win of the option of NO a &quot;dirty game&quot; but it avoid endangering his government decided to cancel a bill to restrict social networks when insulting President Evo Morales and his acts of corruption (like the Gabriela Zapata&#x27;s case). But a law is going to be launched in April or May 2016.

<text>Transport in [[Bolivia]] is mostly by road. The railways were historically important in Bolivia, but now play a relatively small part in the country&#x27;s transport system. Because of the country&#x27;s geography, aviation is also important.

==Railways==

&quot;Total:&quot;
3,504 km (single track)
&quot;Narrow gauge (metre gauge):&quot;
* 3,504 km gauge; (2006)
* The eastern and western networks are joined only via Argentina, due to slow progress on a direct link.
** The map on page 522 of the 1969/1970 edition of JANE&#x27;S shows a link between Cuevos and Zudañez as being &quot;under construction&quot;.

===Rail links with adjacent countries===
* Argentina – yes – both countries
* Brazil – yes – gauge both countries
* Chile – yes – gauge both countries; break of gauge where Chile is gauge
* Peru – Shipping from railhead in Guaqui to railhead in Puno across Lake Titicaca, see Peru train ferry

===Towns served by rail===

===Light Rail===
The first light rail network in Bolivia, the Mi Tren in Cochabamba, began construction in 2017 and was initially intended to be completed by 2020. However, it was delayed in 2019 and came online in 2022.

==Cable Car==

Bolivia is home to Mi Teleférico, the world&#x27;s first urban transit network to use cable cars as the primary mode of transportation. This system services the twin cities of El Alto and La Paz, and increased physical and social mobility within Bolivia.

==Roadways==
Bolivia as of 2004 has 62,479 km of road distance, of which 3,749 km (including 27 km of expressways) is paved and 58,730 km is unpaved.

Road construction in Bolivia is difficult due to its geography and lack of resources to completely develop an advanced road network. However, it maintains a small network of 4-lane freeways which are the following:

*1 Oruro – Patacamaya (&quot;Expected to be completed in a few years, extending to La Paz&quot;). Length: 114 km.
*4 Cochabamba – Quillacollo. Length: 14 km.
*4 Santa Cruz de la Sierra – Montero. Length: 48 km.

The main national roads are:

* RN1 Desaguadero, border with Peru – La Paz – Oruro – Potosí – Tarija – Bermejo, border with Argentina.
* RN2 Copacabana, border with Peru – La Paz.
* RN3 La Paz – San Borja – Trinidad.
* RN4 Tambo Quemado, border with Chile – Cochabamba – Montero – Santa Cruz de la Sierra – Puerto Suárez, border with Brazil.
* RN5 La Palizada – Sucre – Potosí – Border with Chile.
* RN6 Oruro – Sucre – Chaco, border with Paraguay.
* RN7 Cochabamba – Samaipata – Santa Cruz de la Sierra.
* RN8 Yucumo – Riberalta – Guayaramerín, border with Brazil.
* RN9 Guayaramerín, border with Brazil – Trinidad – Santa Cruz de la Sierra – Yacuíba, border with Argentina
* RN10 Montero – San Matías, border with Brazil.
* RN 14 Potosí – Villazón, border with Argentina.

The Interoceanic Highway is an important highway that connects the Amazonian tripoint border region of Brazil, Peru and Bolivia to the Pacific Ocean. Bolivia&#x27;s northernmost capital, Cobija, headquarters a free economic zone that uses the Interoceanic Highway to import and export most of its products.

==Waterways==
10,000 km of commercially navigable waterways (2007)

==Ports and harbors==

===Seaports===
* In October 2010, Peru granted Bolivia port facilities and a free-trade zone as part of larger series of agreements strengthening bilateral relations between the two countries. Bolivia was granted about of port facilities on a 99-year lease at the Port of Ilo on Peru&#x27;s southern Pacific coast. A similar agreement, signed by then Bolivian president Jaime Paz Zamora in 1992, never materialized for a lack of investment in infrastructure. Bolivia has free port privileges in the maritime ports of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.

===Lake Titicaca===
* Guaqui

===Amazon basin===
===Paraguay River (international waterway)===
* Puerto Aguirre
* Puerto Busch
* Puerto Quijarro

==Merchant marine==

There is a total of 23 ships ( or over) totaling / in Bolivia.Ships by type as below: (2008)
==Airports==

There are 1,009 airports in Bolivia as of 2008.
==Pipelines==
* Crude oil 2,745 km
* Liquid petroleum gas 47 km
* Natural gas 4,883 km
* Refined products 1,589 (2008)

<text>The Bolivian Armed Forces (Spanish: &quot;Fuerzas Armadas de Bolivia&quot;) are the military of Bolivia. The Armed Forces of Bolivia are responsible for the defence, both of external and internal, of Bolivia and they are constituted by Bolivian Army, the Bolivian Air Force and the Bolivian Navy. All these institutions depend on the Ministry of Defence of this country.

In addition to the Bolivian Army, the Bolivian Air Force and the Bolivian Navy, the Bolivian National Police, although dependent on the Ministry of Government in times of peace, is part of the reserves of the Armed Forces according to the Organic Law of the Armed Forces of this nation, together with other reserve bodies such as the SAR-FAB emergency and rescue units.

Figures on the size and composition of the armed forces of Bolivia vary considerably, with rare official data available. It is estimated, however, that the three main forces (army, navy and air force) add up to a total of between 40,000 to 70,000 troops, while the Bolivian police would be around 40,000 troops.

==High Command of the Armed Forces of Bolivia==
The roles and tenure of the High Command are described in the Organic Law of the Armed Forces (LOFA) which states that the hierarchy is subordinate to and appointed by the President of Bolivia with the Minister of Defense acting as an intermediary between the President and the Armed Forces. Article 172 of the 2009 Constitution states that amongst the President&#x27;s duties are &quot;To designate and substitute the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and the Commanders of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy.&quot;

The current positions, appointed by interim president Jeanine Áñez Chávez on 13 Nov 2019 are as follows:

* Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces: Gen. Carlos Orellana Centellas
* Military Chief of Staff: Pablo Arturo Guerra Camacho
* Commander of the Army: Gen. Iván Patricio Inchauste
* Commander of the Air Force: Ciro Orlando Álvarez Guzmán
* Commander of the Navy: Rear Admiral Moisés Orlando Mejía Heredia

Article 100 of the LOFA also states that these positions, and several others such as Chief of Police and Head of the Presidential, may be held &quot;only once during the military career and for a time no greater than two years&quot;. This results in a fairly high turnover in the Bolivian High Command with continued service being prohibited by law. The last changes in High Command, under the previous President Evo Morales, occurred on 24 Dec 2018, 11 Dec 2017, 29 Dec 2016, 30 Dec 2015, 18 Dec 2014, 13 Dec 2013 and 3 Dec 2012.

Attempts to increase the maximum length of service for members of the High Command (and other positions) were made, unsuccessfully, under the Morales administration who wished to increase it to between 3 and 5 years.

===Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces===

== Navy ==

:&quot;See full article: Bolivian Navy.&quot;

The Bolivian Naval Force (&quot;Fuerza Naval Boliviana&quot; in Spanish), formerly Bolivian Navy (&quot;Armada Boliviana&quot;) is a naval force about 5,000 strong in 2008. Although Bolivia has been landlocked since the War of the Pacific in 1879, Bolivia established a River and Lake Force (Fuerza Fluvial y Lacustre) in January 1963 under the Ministry of National Defense. It consisted of four boats supplied from the United States and 1,800 personnel recruited largely from the army. Bolivia&#x27;s naval force was renamed the Bolivian Naval Force (Fuerza Naval Boliviana) in January 1966, but it also has been called the Bolivian Navy (Armada Boliviana). It became a separate branch of the armed forces in 1963. Bolivia has large rivers that are tributaries to the Amazon which are patrolled to prevent smuggling and drug trafficking. There is also a Bolivian Naval presence on Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the world, across which runs along the Peruvian frontier.

Landlocked Bolivia has not become reconciled with the loss of its coast to Chile, and the Navy exists to keep the hope of recovering its coast alive by cultivating a maritime consciousness. The Bolivian Navy takes part in many parades and government functions, but none more so than the &quot;Día Del Mar&quot; (Day of the Sea) in which Bolivia, every year, asks for the coast territories lost to Chile during the War of the Pacific (fought between Peru and Bolivia against Chile) from 1879 to 1884. This is still a sore point for Bolivia, influencing many modern-day political actions and trade decisions.

===Districts===
The Navy is organized into ten naval districts, with flotilla headquarters in Guaqui, Guayaramerín, Puerto Suárez, Riberalta, and San Pedro de Tiquina, and bases in Puerto Busch, Puerto Horquilla, Puerto Villarroel, Trinidad, and Rurrenabaque.

Naval vessels include several dozen boats, dozen or more of which are for riverine patrol, including the piranias, and riders, which are powerful river boats. In addition, Bolivia has several seagoing vessels, including the &quot;Santa Cruz de la Sierra&quot; (PR-51), and several flagged ships that sail with the permission of the &quot;Capitanias Navales&quot; Naval Registration Office. The &quot;Libertador Simón Bolívar&quot;, a ship acquired from Venezuela, use to navigate from its home port in Rosario, Argentina on the River Paraná. In 1993, the Navy was formally renamed the &quot;Naval Force&quot; (&quot;Fuerza Naval&quot;) and moved with the Bolivian Army under a single military authority.

Most of the officers are often educated in the Naval Academy where they graduate with a BS in Military and Naval Science, diploma accredited by the Military University and then they do other studies at the bachelor&#x27;s degree and master&#x27;s level. Argentina has their Naval Military Group in Bolivia advising at the highest level in naval strategy and tactics. Many Bolivian officers practice ocean sailing in Argentinean big naval ships. The Bolivian Navy has several Special Forces units to address both internal and external conflicts.

 The Bolivian Naval Force covers the extensive river and lake Bolivian territory divided between the following functions Naval Districts, note that the names of these units are derived from the basin or region where they operate:

**DN1 Primer Distrito Naval &quot;BENI&quot;- DN1 First Naval District &quot;BENI&quot;

==Conscription==
Since 1904 military service has been compulsory for all fit males between the ages of eighteen and forty-nine. In practice, however, budgetary limitations strictly limited the number of eligible men conscripted, and those traditionally tended to be mostly Indians. Beginning in 1967, conscripts were legally held on active duty for up to two years, but funds seldom permitted even a full year&#x27;s service. Noncommissioned officers (NCOs) and warrant officers, all of whom were volunteers, generally were drawn from mixed-blood cholos (those of Spanish and Indian descent). In the late 1980s, the service obligation was one year, and conscripts had to be at least nineteen years of age. The FF.AA. commander reported in early 1989 that the largest percentage of conscripts came from the middle class. One explanation for this change could have been the flocking of youths to the lucrative coca paste-making business. Military authorities in the Cochabamba area in particular began to experience growing difficulty in enlisting volunteers in the mid-1980s. Consequently, the military reportedly was resorting to pressganging eighteen-year-olds off the city streets to fill their annual quotas.

==Training installations==
Training installations include the Garras International Antinarcotics Training School (&quot;Escuela Garras del Valor&quot;) is a military training facility located in Bolivia, which trains military and law enforcement personnel from Bolivia and other Latin American countries in counternarcotics, intelligence, and counterinsurgency techniques.

<doc id="69018" wikidata="Q3647332" url="?curid=69018" title="Foreign relations of Bolivia">
<text>Bolivia traditionally has maintained normal diplomatic relations with all hemispheric states except Chile. Foreign relations are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, headed by the Chancellor of Bolivia, Rogelio Mayta.

==Overview==
Relations with Chile, strained since Bolivia&#x27;s defeat in the War of the Pacific (1879–1883) and its loss of the coastal province of Atacama, were severed from 1962 to 1975 in a dispute over the use of the waters of the Lauca River. Relations were resumed in 1975 but broken again in 1978 over the inability of the two countries to reach an agreement that solved the Atacama border dispute, which might have granted Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea. In the 1960s, relations with Cuba were broken by the Bolivian dictatorship following Castro&#x27;s rise to power but resumed under the Paz Estenssoro Administration in 1985, which came to power through democratic elections.

Bolivia pursues a foreign policy with a heavy economic component. Bolivia has become more active in the Organization of American States (OAS), the Rio Group, and in MERCOSUR, with which it signed an association agreement in 1996. Bolivia promotes its policies on sustainable development and the empowerment of indigenous people.

Bolivia is a member of the United Nations and some of its specialized agencies and related programs; OAS; Andean Community; Intelsat; Non-Aligned Movement; International Parliamentary Union; Latin American Integration Association ALADI; World Trade Organization; Rio Treaty; Rio Group; and Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia (URUPABOL, restarted in 1993). As an outgrowth of the 1994 Summit of the Americas, Bolivia hosted a hemispheric summit conference on sustainable development in December 1996. A First Ladies&#x27; hemispheric summit was also hosted by Bolivia that same month.

Bolivia is also a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States-military (as covered under Article 98).

The GeGaLo Index of gains and losses after energy transition ranks Bolivia 128th out of 156 countries. It is thus among the countries that will lose strength on the international stage if a global transition to renewable energy is carried out and there is no longer demand for Bolivian oil and gas. It is estimated to experience the third largest loss of all Latin American countries (after Colombia and Venezuela).

==United Nations involvement==

Bolivia, being one of the founding members of the United Nations, has frequently been involved with the Intergovernmental Organisation . In November 2008, the Bolivian contingent of UN peacekeeping troops with the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was relocated to safety, as at least one other regional state was also reviewing its own mission&#x27;s security. The country had a detachment of 130 soldiers that was working in Bukavu, but was moved to a location near Goma. Bolivia currently serves as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, with a two-year term ending in 2018. While a member of the Security Council, Bolivia strongly criticized United States President Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to move the United States&#x27; Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and called for a public meeting of the Security Council to respond to the decision. The Bolivian delegation also joined Russia in casting a negative vote for the renewal of the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism in Syria, citing technical concerns about the Mechanism.

During the United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/1, on March 2, 2022, Bolivia voted to abstain, along with 34 other nations.

==International disputes==
Bolivia has wanted a sovereign corridor to the South Pacific Ocean since the Atacama area was lost to Chile in 1884; dispute with Chile over Rio Lauca water rights.

Since the accession of Carlos Mesa to the Presidency, Bolivia has pressed its demands for a corridor to the Pacific. In March 2004, Mesa announced that the government would stage a series of public rallies across the country and in Bolivian embassies abroad in remembrance of those who died in the War of the Pacific, and to call for Chile to grant Bolivia a seacoast. Mesa made this demand a cornerstone of his administration&#x27;s policy.

President Evo Morales maintained a hard position on this issue of which the symbolic importance is underlined by the fact that Bolivia also still has a navy, despite it not currently having access to the sea. In October 2018, the ICJ (International Court of Justice), ruled against Bolivia in a case that would determine whether or not Bolivia could force Chile to negotiate access to the sea. However, the ICJ did state that cooperation was desirable if workable solutions are to be found.

==Illicit drugs==
Bolivia is the world&#x27;s third-largest cultivator of coca (after Peru and Colombia) with an estimated under cultivation in 1999, a 45% decrease in overall cultivation of coca from 1998 levels; intermediate coca products and cocaine exported to or through Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile to the United States and other international drug markets; alternative crop program aims to reduce illicit coca cultivation.

<text>Boniface (1 December 1244–7 June 1263) was Count of Savoy from 1253 to 1263, succeeding his father Amadeus IV. He never married and thus left no heir. 

==Career==
Boniface was born in Chambéry on 1 December 1244. 

Since he became Count of Savoy at the age of nine, he required a regency. Throughout the decade before his death, Savoy was governed through a joint regency resembling that devised for his grandfather Thomas in 1189, in which authority was shared between his mother, Cecile of Baux, and one of his uncles, Thomas II of Piedmont. Boniface&#x27;s other uncles, Peter and Philip, disputed this, seeking to divide the county&#x27;s many properties, but Thomas took it to arbitration per the family treaty of 1234 which had been negotiated by his brother William and won out. Peter and Philip were, however, granted compensation in return, receiving more properties within the county. When Thomas died in 1259, Cecile continued as regent in Savoy. Under her regency, Philip and Peter continued their previous work of expanding the control and influence over the County of Savoy.

Boniface&#x27;s campaigns in Flanders and Piedmont were not successful. In September 1262, Rudolf of Geneva offered homage to cousin Boniface after yet another round of the war between Peter and their kin in Geneva. On 7 July 1263 in Turin, Boniface was mortally wounded in battle and died aged 18, to be succeeded by his uncle Peter.

<text>Kálmán Kalocsay (; 6 October 1891 in Abaújszántó – 27 February 1976) was a Hungarian Esperantist poet, translator, and editor who significantly influenced Esperanto culture, both in its literature and in the language itself, through his original poetry and his translations of literary works from his native Hungarian and other languages of Europe. His name is sometimes Esperantized as Kolomano Kaloĉajo, and some of his work was published under various pseudonyms, including &quot;C.E.R. Bumy, Kopar, Alex Kay, K. Stelov, Malice Pik&quot; and &quot;Peter Peneter&quot;.

Kalocsay studied medicine and later became a surgeon and the chief infectious disease specialist at a major Budapest hospital. He learned both Esperanto and its breakaway dialect Ido in his adolescence, but became more inclined towards Esperanto after he had seen its greater literary potential. In 1921 his first original collection of poems, &quot;Mondo kaj Koro&quot; (“World and heart”) was published. A further decade passed before the appearance of his collection &quot;Streĉita Kordo&quot; (“A taut string”), which many Esperantists consider one of the finest collections of original Esperanto poetry, and &quot;Rimportretoj&quot; (“Portraits in rhyme”), witty poems in rondel style about various people then prominent in the Esperanto movement. In 1932, under the pseudonym Peter Peneter, he published &quot;Sekretaj Sonetoj&quot; (“Secret sonnets”), a book of erotic verse.

In addition to being a prolific author of Esperanto works, Kalocsay guided the Esperanto literary world through a magazine and publishing house called &quot;Literaturo Mondo&quot; (“Literary world”). A group of writers who coalesced around this magazine during the 1920s and 1930s were known as the &quot;Budapest school&quot; (&quot;Budapeŝto skolo&quot;).

Works of Kalocsay about literary and linguistic theory include the expansive &quot;Plena Gramatiko de Esperanto&quot; (“Complete grammar of Esperanto”) and &quot;Parnasa Gvidlibro&quot; (“Handbook of Parnassus”), a work on Esperanto poetics co-authored with Gaston Waringhien, and an academic style guide for Esperanto, &quot;Lingvo – Stilo – Formo&quot; (“Language, style and form”). Kalocsay also co-compiled the two-volume &quot;Enciklopedio de Esperanto&quot; (“Encyclopædia of Esperanto”).

Much was written about Kalocsay by his literary executor Ada Csiszár, after whose death the estate passed to the Esperanto Museum of the Austrian National Library.

<doc id="69024" wikidata="Q81178" url="?curid=69024" title="Baffin Island">
<text>Baffin Island (formerly Baffin Land), in the Canadian territory of Nunavut, is the largest island in Canada, the second-largest island in the Americas (behind Greenland), and the fifth-largest island in the world. Its area is (slightly smaller than Thailand) with a population density of 0.03/km2; the population was 13,039 according to the 2021 Canadian census; and it is located at . It also contains the city of Iqaluit (with a population of around 7,000), which is the capital of Nunavut.

==Name==
The Inuktitut name for the island is , which means &quot;very big island&quot; ( &quot;island&quot; + &quot;very big&quot;) and in Inuktitut syllabics is written as . This name is used for the administrative region the island is part of (Qikiqtaaluk Region), as well as in multiple places in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, such as some smaller islands: Qikiqtaaluk in Baffin Bay and Qikiqtaaluk in Foxe Basin. Norse explorers referred to it as (&quot;stone land&quot;). 

In 1576, English seaman Martin Frobisher made landfall on the island, naming it &quot;Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Foreland&quot; and Frobisher Bay is named after him. The island is named after English explorer William Baffin, who, in 1616, came across the island while trying to discover the Northwest Passage. 

It was also formerly known as James Island.

==Geography==


Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, is located on the southeastern coast. Until 1987, the town was called Frobisher Bay, after the English name for Frobisher Bay on which it is located, named for Martin Frobisher. That year, the community voted to restore the Inuktitut name.

To the south lies Hudson Strait, separating Baffin Island from mainland Quebec. South of the western end of the island is the Fury and Hecla Strait, which separates the island from the Melville Peninsula on the mainland. To the east are Davis Strait and Baffin Bay, with Greenland beyond. The Foxe Basin, the Gulf of Boothia and Lancaster Sound separate Baffin Island from the rest of the Arctic Archipelago to the west and north.

The Baffin Mountains run along the northeastern coast of the island and are a part of the Arctic Cordillera. The highest peak is Mount Odin, with an elevation of at least , although some sources say . Another peak of note is Mount Asgard, located in Auyuittuq National Park, with an elevation of . Mount Thor, with an elevation of , is said to have the greatest purely vertical drop (a sheer cliff face) of any mountain on Earth, at . 

The two largest lakes on the island lie in the south-central part of the island: Nettilling Lake () and Amadjuak Lake () further south.

==History==
Baffin Island has been inhabited for over 3,000 years, first by the pre-Dorset, followed by the Dorset, and then by the Thule people, ancestors of the Inuit, who have lived on the island for the last thousand years. The Thule people genetically and culturally completely replaced the Dorset people some time after 1300 CE. In about 986, Erik Thorvaldsson, known as Erik the Red, formed three settlements near the southwestern tip of Greenland. In late 985 or 986, Bjarni Herjólfsson, sailing from Iceland to Greenland, was blown off course and sighted land southwest of Greenland. Bjarni appears to be the first European to see Baffin Island, and the first European to see North America beyond Greenland. It was about 15 years later that the Norse Greenlanders, led by Leif Erikson, a son of Erik the Red, started exploring new areas around the year 1000. Baffin Island is thought to be Helluland, and the archaeological site at Tanfield Valley is thought to have been a trading post. The &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;, 1880 translation into English by J. Sephton from the original Icelandic :
In September 2008, the &quot;Nunatsiaq News&quot;, a weekly newspaper, reported that Patricia Sutherland, who worked at the Canadian Museum of Civilization, had found archaeological remains of yarn and cordage [string], rat droppings, tally sticks, a carved wooden Dorset culture face mask depicting Caucasian features, and possible architectural remains, which indicated that European traders and possibly settlers had been on Baffin Island not later than 1000 CE. What the source of this Old World contact may have been is unclear and controversial; the newspaper article states:

Sutherland&#x27;s research eventually led to a 2012 announcement that whetstones had been found with remnants of alloys indicative of Viking presence. In 2018, Michele Hayeur Smith of Brown University, who specialises in the study of ancient textiles, wrote that she does not think the ancient Arctic people, the Dorset and Thule, needed to be taught how to spin yarn: &quot;It&#x27;s a pretty intuitive thing to do.&quot;


William W. Fitzhugh, director of the Arctic Studies Center at the Smithsonian Institution, and a senior scientist at the National Museum of Natural History, wrote that there is insufficient published evidence to support Sutherland&#x27;s claims, and that the Dorset were using spun cordage by the 6th century. 

In 1992, Elizabeth Wayland Barber wrote that a piece of three-ply yarn that dates to the Paleolithic era, that ended about 10,000 BP, was found at the Lascaux caves in France. This yarn consisted of three s-twist strands that were z-plied, much like the way a three-ply yarn is made now, the Baffin Island yarn was a simple two-ply yarn. The eight sod buildings and artifacts found in the 1960s at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, located on the northern tip of Newfoundland Island, remains the only confirmed Norse site in North America outside of those found in Greenland.

==Administration==
Baffin Island is part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region.

==Demographics==

The population of Baffin Island at the 2021 Canadian census was 13,039 giving a population density of . The population accounts for 67.37 per cent of the 19,355 people in the Qikiqtaaluk Region, 56.51 per cent of the population of the Arctic Archipelago, and 35.38 per cent of the population of Nunavut.

As of the 2016 Canadian census the majority, 74.06 per cent, were Indigenous peoples and 25.83 per cent were non-Indigenous. This compares to 88.85 per cent and 14.12 per cent Indigenous and non-Indigenous people for Nunavut as a whole. This lower percentage of Indigenous peoples on Baffin Island results from Iqaluit being 59.29 per cent Indigenous and 40.65 per cent non-Indigenous. Of the total population 72.17 per cent are Inuit, 0.92 per cent are First Nations, and 0.73 per cent are Métis. Except for a few First Nations people in Arctic Bay all non-Inuit Indigenous peoples live in Iqaluit.

The hamlets of Kinngait (population: 1,396) and Qikiqtarjuaq (population: 593) do not lie on Baffin Island proper. Kinngait is situated on Dorset Island, which is located a few kilometres from the south eastern tip of the Foxe Peninsula. Similarly, Qikiqtarjuaq is situated on Broughton Island, which is located near the northern coast of the Cumberland Peninsula.

The Mary River Mine, an iron ore mine with an estimated 21-year life, at Mary River, may include building a railway and a port to transport the ore. This may create a temporary mining community there.

==Wildlife==

Baffin Island is home to the Dewey Soper Migratory Bird Sanctuary and the Bowman Bay Wildlife Sanctuary.

The Dewey Soper Migratory Bird Sanctuary, named for J. Dewey Soper, is located on the western side of Baffin Island from Bowman Bay to the Koukdjuak River. It is an area that was classified a wetland of international importance via the Ramsar Convention on May 24, 1982. It is home of the world&#x27;s largest goose colony and supports a large number of barren-ground caribou.

The Bowman Bay Wildlife Sanctuary is also located on the western side of Baffin Island near Bowman Bay in the Great Plain of the Koukdjuak. It is and is classified as Category IV (Habitat/Species Management Area) under the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Baffin Island has both year-round and summer visitor wildlife. On land, examples of year-round wildlife are barren-ground caribou, polar bear, Arctic fox, red fox, Arctic hare, lemming, and Baffin Island wolf.

Barren-ground caribou herds migrate in a limited range from northern Baffin Island down to the southern part in winter, even to the Frobisher Bay peninsula, next to Resolution Island, then migrating back north in the summer. In 2012, a survey of caribou herds found that the local population was only about 5,000, a decrease of as much as 95% from the 1990s.

Arctic hares are found throughout Baffin Island. Their fur is pure white in winter and moults to a scruffy dark grey in summer. Arctic hares and lemmings are an important food source for Arctic and red foxes and Arctic wolves.

Lemmings are also found throughout the island and are a major food source for foxes, wolves and the snowy owl. In the winter, lemmings dig complicated tunnel systems through the snow drifts to get to their food supply of dry grasses and lichens.

===Predators===
Polar bears can be found all along the coast of Baffin Island but are most prevalent where the sea ice takes the form of pack ice, where their major food sources—ringed seals (jar seal) and bearded seals—live. Polar bears mate approximately every year, bearing one to three cubs around March. Female polar bears may travel inland to find a large snow bank where they dig a den in which to spend the winter and later give birth. The polar bear population here is one of 19 genetically distinct demes of the circumpolar region.

Red foxes can be found predominantly in the southernmost areas of Baffin Island, away from the harshest of winter weather, though some individuals may forage and explore elsewhere. The Arctic foxes can usually be found where polar bears venture on the fast ice close to land in their search for seals. Arctic foxes are scavengers and often follow polar bears to get their leavings. They also are known to take ground-nesting birds and their eggs and chicks, such as ducks, geese, ptarmigan, seagulls, shorebirds and even snowy owls, on occasion. On Baffin Island, Arctic foxes are sometimes trapped by Inuit, but there is no longer a robust fur industry.

The Arctic wolf and the Baffin Island wolf, a grey wolf subspecies, are also year-round residents of Baffin Island. Unlike the grey wolf in southern climes, Arctic wolves often have smaller social networks, due to the barren landscape and minimal resources, thus resulting in unique hierarchies when compared with wolves found further south. For example, Arctic wolves often do not hunt in packs, although a male-female pair may hunt together.


===Birds===
Nesting birds are summer land visitors to Baffin Island. Baffin Island is one of the major nesting destinations from the Eastern and Mid-West flyways for many species of migrating birds. Waterfowl include eiders, Canada goose, snow goose, cackling goose, and brant goose (brent goose). Shore birds include the phalarope, various waders (commonly called sandpipers), murres including Brünnich&#x27;s guillemot, and plovers. Gull species also nest on Baffin Island and they include Sabine&#x27;s gull, glaucous gull, herring gull and ivory gull.

Long-range travellers include the Arctic tern, which migrates from Antarctica every spring. The varieties of water birds that nest here include coots, loons, mallards, and many other duck species.

===Marine mammals===
In the water (and under the ice), the main year-round species is the ringed seal subspecies, the Arctic ringed seal. It lives offshore within of land. In winter, it makes a number of breathing holes in the ice, up to thick. It visits each one often to keep the hole open and free from ice. In March, when a female is ready to whelp, she will enlarge one of the breathing holes that has snow over it, creating a small &quot;igloo&quot; where she whelps one or two pups. Within three weeks the pups are in the water and swimming. In summer, some ringed seals keep to a narrow territory about along the shoreline but may move out into the open water. In the spring they spend more time on the surface of the ice.

====Summer visitors====
Water species that visit Baffin Island in the summer are:

Harp seals (or saddle-backed seals), which migrate from major breeding grounds off the coast of Labrador and the southeast coast of Greenland to Baffin Island for the summer. Migrating at speeds of , they all come up to breathe at the same time, then dive and swim up to before surfacing again. They migrate in large pods consisting of a hundred or more seals to within of the shoreline, which they then follow, feeding on crustaceans and fish.

Walruses, which do not migrate far off land in the winter. They merely follow the fast ice, or ice that is solidly attached to land, and stay ahead of it as the ice hardens further and further out to sea. As winter progresses, they will always remain where there is open water free of ice. When the ice melts, they move in to land and can be found basking on rocks close to shore. One of the largest walrus herds can be found in the Foxe Basin on the western side of Baffin Island.

Beluga or white whales migrate along the coast of Baffin Island; some head north to the feeding grounds in the Davis Strait between Greenland and Baffin Island, or into the Hudson Strait or any of the bays and estuaries in between. Usually travelling in pods of two or more, they can often be found very close to shore ( or less). They come up to breathe every 30 seconds or so as they make their way along the coastline eating crustaceans.

Narwhals, which are known for the males&#x27; long, spiralling single tusk, can also be found along the coast of Baffin Island in the summer. Much like their beluga cousins, they may be found in pairs or even in a large pod of ten or more males, females and newborns. They also can be often found close to the shoreline, gracefully pointing their tusks skyward as they come up for air.

The largest summer visitor to Baffin Island is the bowhead whale. Found throughout the Arctic range, one group of bowhead whales is known to migrate to the Foxe Basin, a bay on the western side of Baffin Island.

==Climate==

Baffin Island lies in the path of a generally northerly airflow all year round, so, like much of northeastern Canada, it has an extremely cold climate. This brings very long, cold winters and foggy, cloudy summers, which have helped to add to the remoteness of the island. Spring thaw arrives much later than normal for a position straddling the Arctic Circle: around early June at Iqaluit in the south-east but around early- to mid-July on the north coast where glaciers run right down to sea level. Snow, even heavy snow, can occur at any time of the year, although it is least likely in July and early August. Average annual temperatures at Iqaluit are around , compared with around in Reykjavík, which is at a similar latitude.

Sea ice surrounds the island for most of the year and only disappears completely from the north coast for short, unpredictable periods from mid- to late June until the end of September.

Most of Baffin Island lies north of the Arctic Circle—all communities from Pangnirtung northwards have polar night in winter and midnight sun in summer. The eastern community of Clyde River has twilight instead of night from April 26 until May 13, continuous sunlight for 2 months from May 14 to July 28, then twilight instead of night from July 29 until August 16. This gives the community just over 3 months without true night. In the winter, the sun sets on November 22 and does not rise again until January 19 of the next year. Pond Inlet has civil twilight from December 16 to December 26. However, there is twilight for at least 4 hours per day, unlike places such as Eureka.

Like most of Nunavut and the Canadian Arctic, Baffin Island has a tundra climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;ET&quot;), although the highest ice caps have an ice cap climate (&quot;EF&quot;). The sea is frozen for most of the year, and only a few months are above freezing. There can be seasonal lag in spring.

The Barnes Ice Cap, in the middle of the island, has been retreating since at least the early 1960s, when the Geographical Branch of the then Department of Mines and Technical Surveys sent a three-man survey team to the area to measure isostatic rebound and cross-valley features of the Isortoq River. Although in the 1970s parts of Baffin Island failed to have the usual ice-free period in the summer.

Climate tables from south to north

==Economic resources==
The Hall Peninsula of southern Baffin Island includes the Chidliak Kimberlite Province, which had been found to include kimberlite pipes of diamond-bearing kimberlite.

The Mary River iron ore mine began operating in 2015, and shipped 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore in 2023.

==In popular culture==
&quot;The White Dawn&quot; is a 1974 film set on and filmed on Baffin Island. All performers except three Hollywood actors were Inuit who spoke their own language.

The opening scene of the 1977 James Bond film, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, featuring a cliff jump and parachute drop on skis, was filmed at Mount Asgard in Auyuittuq National Park on Baffin Island.

The Polar Star Couloir, on Mount Beluga in the Kangiqtualuk Uqquqti (Sam Ford Fjord) area near Clyde River, is listed in &quot;Fifty Classic Ski Descents of North America&quot; as a backcountry skiing feature.

<text>Thomas II (c. 1199 – 7 February 1259) was the Lord of Piedmont from 1233 to his death, Count of Flanders &quot;jure uxoris&quot; from 1237 to 1244, and regent of the County of Savoy from 1253 to his death, while his nephew Boniface was fighting abroad. He was the son of Thomas I of Savoy and Margaret of Geneva.

==Career==
Thomas was born in Montmélian. He started his career in the church as a canon at Lausanne and became prévôt of Valence by 1226. In 1233, when Thomas I of Savoy died, Thomas, being a younger son, inherited only the lordship of Piedmont, which he later raised to the status of a county.

In 1235, when Thomas left his ecclesiastical career, he sought to fully divide his lands from the County of Savoy. His elder brother, Amadeus IV, negotiated with him to grant Thomas additional lands within the county, but that all lands would stay part of the county. Further, Thomas was encouraged like his other brothers to expand his holdings outside of Savoy.

In 1234, Thomas and his brother William escorted his niece, Margaret of Provence to her wedding with Louis IX of France. While Thomas hoped to stay with her at the French court, the king&#x27;s mother, Blanche of Castile, wanted greater control over the new queen, and so dismissed all who came with her before the couple even reached Paris.

===Count of Flanders===
At the urging of Louis IX of France, Thomas married Joanna, Countess of Flanders and Hainaut, widow of Ferdinand, Count of Flanders and daughter of the Latin Emperor Baldwin I, in 1237.

His loyalties as Count of Flanders were divided between the kings of France and England. In 1239, Thomas travelled to England to pay homage to Henry III, King of England. While there, his niece, Eleanor of Provence, gave birth to Edward. After recognizing Henry as his suzerain, Thomas received an annual stipend of 500 marks. He returned to visit the family around Easter of 1240 and was given a gift which Henry III of England extracted from the lands of Simon de Montfort.

The count and countess were very generous toward local churches, and Thomas often followed his wife&#x27;s lead on such matters. Thomas also understood the needs of the emerging merchant class, and worked to provide better rights for them. This included granting new charters and restructuring the governance in key cities such as Damme and Bruges.

In July 1243, Thomas and his brother Amadeus were ordered by Enzo of Sardinia to join in a siege of Vercelli, which had recently switched allegiances from the Empire to the Pope. Not only was the attack on the city unsuccessful, but the brothers were excommunicated for it. When the brothers wrote to the new Pope Innocent IV to appeal, he granted their request, and further indicated that Thomas would be protected from excommunication without papal authorization.

Thomas and Joanna had no issue and she died in 1244.

===Later years===
In 1255, Thomas was protecting his territories in the Piedmont region against the town of Asti. In a battle at Moncalieri, he was taken prisoner and held in Turin. The two cities were seeking to force Thomas to acknowledge their independence from Savoy control. In response, Pope Alexander IV placed an interdict against Turin and Asti, and King Henry III of England imprisoned all Lombards in his kingdom. Louis IX of France arrested 150 Asti merchants at the urging of his wife (and Thomas&#x27;s niece) Margaret. Beatrice of Savoy did the same in her territories in Provence. Thomas&#x27;s brothers, Peter and Philip led an army down from Savoy in 1256, and were able to force a negotiated settlement by the end of the year. In that settlement, the cities were recognized as independent, though they did not achieve the territorial or economic benefits they were originally seeking.

Although he was the next brother of Amadeus IV, he never became the Count of Savoy because he predeceased his nephew, Boniface, who himself died without sons to succeed him. Thomas did act as regent for Boniface during the early years of his reign. Although Thomas left sons, upon Boniface&#x27;s death the remaining uncles, younger brothers of Thomas, ruled the County of Savoy. Thomas&#x27;s eldest son and heir Thomas III thought it to be an injustice and unsuccessfully claimed Savoy. However, it so happened that Philip I, the last surviving brother of Thomas, made Thomas&#x27; younger son Amadeus his heir in Savoy, leaving the elder son, Thomas, and the genealogically senior line descending from him out of the Savoy succession.

==Issue==
In 1252, Thomas married Beatrice Fieschi, who died on 15 July 1283, only daughter of Tedisio Fieschi, Count of Lavagna, by first wife Vigolan di Capo Corso, half-sister of Pope Adrian V and paternal niece of Pope Innocent IV. Thomas and Beatrice had six children:
*Thomas, his successor and pretender to the County of Savoy
*Amadeus, who later inherited Savoy
*Louis Ι (1250 – after 10 January 1302), Baron of Vaud
*Eleanor (died 6 December 1296), married (1270) Louis I of Beaujeu
*Margaret (died May 1292), married first Baldwin de Redvers, 7th Earl of Devon and after his death Sir Robert II Aguillon
*Alice (died 1 August 1277)

He also had at least three illegitimate children꞉ 
*Lancelot
*Nicolas
*Francis, married and had꞉ 
**Peret, living in 1269

<text>In the card game of poker, a bluff is a bet or raise made with a hand which is not thought to be the best hand. &quot;To bluff&quot; is to make such a bet. The objective of a bluff is to induce a fold by at least one opponent who holds a better hand. The size and frequency of a bluff determines its profitability to the &quot;bluffer&quot;. By extension, the phrase &quot;calling somebody&#x27;s bluff&quot; is often used outside the context of poker to describe situations where one person demands that another proves a claim, or proves that they are not being deceptive.

== Pure bluff ==
A pure bluff, or stone-cold bluff, is a bet or raise with an inferior hand that has little or no chance of improving. A player making a pure bluff believes they can win the pot only if all opponents fold. The pot odds for a bluff are the ratio of the size of the bluff to the pot. A pure bluff has a positive expectation (will be profitable in the long run) when the probability of being called by an opponent is lower than the pot odds for the bluff.

For example, suppose that after all the cards are out, a player holding a busted drawing hand decides that the only way to win the pot is to make a pure bluff. If the player bets the size of the pot on a pure bluff, the bluff will have a positive expectation if the probability of being called is less than 50%. Note, however, that the opponent may also consider the pot odds when deciding whether to call. In this example, the opponent will be facing 2-to-1 pot odds for the call. The opponent will have a positive expectation for calling the bluff if the opponent believes the probability the player is bluffing is at least 33%.

== Semi-bluff ==
In games with multiple betting rounds, to bluff on one round with an inferior or drawing hand that might improve in a later round is called a semi-bluff. A player making a semi-bluff can win the pot two different ways: by all opponents folding immediately or by catching a card to improve the player&#x27;s hand. In some cases a player may be on a draw but with odds strong enough that they are favored to win the hand. In this case their bet is not classified as a semi-bluff even though their bet may force opponents to fold hands with better current strength.

For example, a player in a stud poker game with four spade-suited cards showing (but none among their downcards) on the penultimate round might raise, hoping that their opponents believe the player already has a flush. If their bluff fails and they are called, the player still might be dealt a spade on the final card and win the showdown (or they might be dealt another non-spade and try to bluff again, in which case it is a &quot;pure bluff&quot; on the final round rather than a semi-bluff).

== Bluffing circumstances ==
Bluffing may be more effective in some circumstances than others. Bluffs have a higher expectation when the probability of being called decreases. Several game circumstances may decrease the probability of being called (and increase the profitability of the bluff):
* Fewer opponents who must fold to the bluff.
* The bluff provides less favorable pot odds to opponents for a call.
* A scare card comes that increases the number of superior hands that the player may be perceived to have.
* The player&#x27;s betting pattern in the hand has been consistent with the superior hand they are representing with the bluff.
* The opponent&#x27;s betting pattern suggests the opponent may have a marginal hand that is vulnerable to a greater number of potential superior hands.
* The opponent&#x27;s betting pattern suggests the opponent may have a drawing hand and the bluff provides unfavorable pot odds to the opponent for chasing the draw.
* Opponents are not irrationally committed to the pot (see sunk cost fallacy).
* Opponents are sufficiently skilled and paying sufficient attention.

The opponent&#x27;s current state of mind should be taken into consideration when bluffing. Under certain circumstances external pressures or events can significantly impact an opponent&#x27;s decision making skills.

== Optimal bluffing frequency ==

If a player bluffs too infrequently, observant opponents will recognize that the player is betting for value and will call with very strong hands or with drawing hands only when they are receiving favorable pot odds. If a player bluffs too frequently, observant opponents &quot;snap off&quot; their bluffs by calling or re-raising. Occasional bluffing disguises not just the hands a player is bluffing with, but also their legitimate hands that opponents may think they may be bluffing with. David Sklansky, in his book &quot;The Theory of Poker&quot;, states &quot;Mathematically, the optimal bluffing strategy is to bluff in such a way that the chances against your bluffing are identical to the pot odds your opponent is getting.&quot;

Optimal bluffing also requires that the bluffs must be performed in such a manner that opponents cannot tell when a player is bluffing or not. To prevent bluffs from occurring in a predictable pattern, game theory suggests the use of a randomizing agent to determine whether to bluff. For example, a player might use the colors of their hidden cards, the second hand on their watch, or some other unpredictable mechanism to determine whether to bluff.

===Example (Texas Hold&#x27;em)===
Here is an example for the game of Texas Hold&#x27;em, from &quot;The Theory of Poker&quot;:
when I bet my $100, creating a $300 pot, my opponent was getting 3-to-1 odds
from the pot. Therefore my optimum strategy was ... [to make] the odds against
my bluffing 3-to-1.
Since the dealer will always bet with (nut hands) in this situation, they should bluff with (their) &quot;Weakest hands/bluffing range&quot; 1/3 of the time in order to make the odds 3-to-1 against a bluff.

Ex:
On the last betting round (river), Worm has been betting a &quot;semi-bluff&quot; drawing hand with: A♠ K♠ on the board:

10♠ 9♣ 2♠ 4♣
against Mike&#x27;s A♣ 10♦ hand.

The river comes out:

2♣

The pot is currently 30 dollars, and Worm is contemplating a 30-dollar bluff on the river. If Worm does bluff in this situation, they are giving Mike 2-to-1 pot odds to call with their two pair (10&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s).

In these hypothetical circumstances, Worm will have the nuts 50% of the time, and be on a busted draw 50% of the time. Worm will bet the nuts 100% of the time, and bet with a bluffing hand (using mixed optimal strategies):

formula_1 

Where &quot;s&quot; is equal to the percentage of the pot that Worm is bluff betting with and &quot;x&quot; is equal to the percentage of busted draws Worm should be bluffing with to bluff optimally.

Pot = 30 dollars.
Bluff bet = 30 dollars.

&quot;s&quot; = 30(pot) / 30(bluff bet) = 1.

Worm should be bluffing with their busted draws:

formula_2 Where &quot;s&quot; = 1

&quot;Assuming four trials&quot;, Worm has the nuts two times, and has a busted draw two times. (EV = expected value)
Under the circumstances of this example: Worm will bet their nut hand two times, for every one time they bluff against Mike&#x27;s hand (assuming Mike&#x27;s hand would lose to the nuts and beat a bluff). This means that (if Mike called all three bets) Mike would win one time, and lose two times, and would break even against 2-to-1 pot odds. This also means that Worm&#x27;s odds against bluffing is also 2-to-1 (since they will value bet twice, and bluff once).

Say in this example, Worm decides to use the second hand of their watch to determine when to bluff (50% of the time). If the second hand of the watch is between 1 and 30 seconds, Worm will check their hand down (not bluff). If the second hand of the watch is between 31 and 60 seconds, Worm will bluff their hand. Worm looks down at their watch, and the second hand is at 45 seconds, so Worm decides to bluff. Mike folds his two pair saying, &quot;the way you&#x27;ve been betting your hand, I don&#x27;t think my two pair on the board will hold up against your hand.&quot; Worm takes the pot by using optimal bluffing frequencies.

This example is meant to illustrate how optimal bluffing frequencies work. Because it was an example, we assumed that Worm had the nuts 50% of the time, and a busted draw 50% of the time. In real game situations, this is not usually the case.

The purpose of optimal bluffing frequencies is to make the opponent (mathematically) indifferent between calling and folding. Optimal bluffing frequencies are based upon game theory and the Nash equilibrium, and &quot;assist&quot; the player using these strategies to become unexploitable. By bluffing in optimal frequencies, you will typically end up breaking even on your bluffs (in other words, optimal bluffing frequencies &quot;are not&quot; meant to generate positive expected value from the bluffs alone). Rather, optimal bluffing frequencies allow you to gain &quot;more&quot; value from your value bets, because your opponent is indifferent between calling or folding when you bet (regardless of whether it&#x27;s a value bet or a bluff bet).

== Bluffing in other games ==
Although bluffing is most often considered a poker term, similar tactics are useful in other games as well. In these situations, a player makes a play that should not be profitable unless an opponent misjudges it as being made from a position capable of justifying it. Since a successful bluff requires deceiving one&#x27;s opponent, it occurs only in games in which the players conceal information from each other. In games like chess and backgammon, both players can see the same board and so should simply make the best legal move available. Examples include:

* Contract Bridge: Psychic bids and falsecards are attempts to mislead the opponents about the distribution of the cards. A risk (common to all bluffing in partnership games) is that a bluff may also confuse the bluffer&#x27;s partner. Psychic bids serve to make it harder for the opponents to find a good contract or to accurately place the key missing cards with a defender. Falsecarding (a tactic available in most trick taking card games) is playing a card that would naturally be played from a different hand distribution in hopes that an opponent will wrongly assume that the falsecarder made a natural play from a different hand and misplay a later trick on that assumption.
* Stratego: Much of the strategy in Stratego revolves around identifying the ranks of the opposing pieces. Therefore, depriving your opponent of this information is valuable. In particular, the &quot;Shoreline Bluff&quot; involves placing the flag in an unnecessarily-vulnerable location in the hope that the opponent will not look for it there. It is also common to bluff an attack that one would never actually make by initiating pursuit of a piece known to be strong, with an as-yet unidentified but weaker piece. Until the true rank of the pursuing piece is revealed, the player with the stronger piece might retreat if their opponent does not pursue them with a weaker piece. That might buy time for the bluffer to bring in a faraway piece that can actually defend against the bluffed piece.
* Spades: In late game situations, it is useful to bid a nil even if it cannot succeed. If the third seat bidder sees that making a natural bid would allow the fourth seat bidder to make an uncontestable bid for game, they may bid nil even if it has no chance of success. The last bidder then must choose whether to make their natural bid (and lose the game if the nil succeeds) or to respect the nil by making a riskier bid that allows their side to win even if the doomed nil is successful. If the player chooses wrong and both teams miss their bids, the game continues.
* Scrabble: Scrabble players will sometimes deliberately play an invalid &quot;phony&quot; word in the hope the opponent does not challenge it, and allows them to score for it. Bluffing in Scrabble is a bit different from the other examples. Scrabble players conceal their tiles but have little opportunity to make significant deductions about their opponent&#x27;s tiles (except in the endgame) and even less opportunity to spread disinformation about them. Bluffing by playing a phony is instead based on assuming players have imperfect knowledge of the acceptable word list.

== Artificial intelligence ==
Evan Hurwitz and Tshilidzi Marwala developed a software agent that bluffed while playing a poker-like game. They used intelligent agents to design agent outlooks. The agent was able to learn to predict its opponents&#x27; reactions based on its own cards and the actions of others. By using reinforcement neural networks, the agents were able to learn to bluff without prompting.

== Economic theory ==
In economics, bluffing has been explained as rational equilibrium behavior in games with information asymmetries. For instance, consider the hold-up problem, a central ingredient of the theory of incomplete contracts. There are two players. Today player A can make an investment; tomorrow player B offers how to divide the returns of the investment. If player A rejects the offer, they can realize only a fraction x&lt;1 of these returns on their own. Suppose player A has private information about x. Goldlücke and Schmitz (2014) have shown that player A might make a large investment even if player A is weak (i.e., when they know that x is small). The reason is that a large investment may lead player B to believe that player A is strong (i.e., x is large), so that player B will make a generous offer. Hence, bluffing can be a profitable strategy for player A.

<text>Thoth (from &quot;Thṓth&quot;, borrowed from &quot;Thōout&quot;, Egyptian: &quot;&quot;, the reflex of &quot;[he] is like the ibis&quot;) is an ancient Egyptian deity. In art, he was often depicted as a man with the head of an ibis or a baboon, animals sacred to him. His feminine counterpart was Seshat, and his wife was Ma&#x27;at. He was the god of the Moon, wisdom, knowledge, writing, hieroglyphs, science, magic, art and judgment.

Thoth&#x27;s chief temple was located in the city of Hermopolis ( , Egyptological pronunciation: &quot;Khemenu&quot;, &quot;Shmun&quot;). Later known as &quot;el-Ashmunein&quot; in Egyptian Arabic, the Temple of Thoth was mostly destroyed before the beginning of the Christian era. Its very large pronaos was still standing in 1826, but was demolished and used as fill for the foundation of a sugar factory by the mid-19th century.

Thoth played many vital and prominent roles in Egyptian mythology, such as maintaining the universe, and being one of the two deities (the other being Ma&#x27;at) who stood on either side of Ra&#x27;ssolar barque. In the later history of ancient Egypt, Thoth became heavily associated with the arbitration of godly disputes, the arts of magic, the system of writing, and the judgment of the dead.

==God==

The Egyptian pronunciation of &quot;ḏḥwty&quot; is not fully known, but may be reconstructed as *&quot;ḏiḥautī,&quot; perhaps pronounced * or *. This reconstruction is based on the Ancient Greek borrowing &#x27; () or &#x27; and the fact that the name was transliterated into Sahidic Coptic variously as &quot;Thoout&quot;, &quot;Thōth&quot;, &quot;Thoot&quot;, &quot;Thaut&quot;, &quot;Taauto&quot;s (&quot;Τααυτος&quot;), &quot;Thoor&quot; (&quot;Θωωρ&quot;), as well as Bohairic Coptic &quot;Thōout&quot;. These spellings reflect known sound changes from earlier Egyptian such as the loss of &quot;ḏ&quot; palatalization and merger of &quot;ḥ&quot; with &quot;h&quot; i.e. initial &quot;ḏḥ &gt; th &gt; tʰ.&quot; The loss of pre-Coptic final &quot;y/j&quot; is also common. Following Egyptological convention, which eschews vowel reconstruction, the consonant skeleton &quot;ḏḥwty&quot; would be rendered &quot;Djehuti&quot; and the god is sometimes found under this name. However, the Greek form &quot;Thoth&quot; is more common.

According to Theodor Hopfner, Thoth&#x27;s Egyptian name written as &quot;ḏḥwty&quot; originated from &quot;ḏḥw&quot;, claimed to be the oldest known name for the ibis, normally written as &quot;hbj&quot;. The addition of &quot;-ty&quot; denotes that he possessed the attributes of the ibis. Hence Thoth&#x27;s name would mean &quot;He who is like the ibis&quot;, according to this interpretation.

Other forms of the name &quot;ḏḥwty&quot; using older transcriptions include &quot;Jehuti, Jehuty, Tahuti, Tehuti, Zehuti, Techu,&quot; or &quot;Tetu&quot;. Multiple titles for Thoth, similar to the pharaonic titulary, are also known, including &quot;A&quot;, &quot;Sheps&quot;, &quot;Lord of Khemennu&quot;, &quot;Asten&quot;, &quot;Khenti&quot;, &quot;Mehi&quot;, &quot;Hab&quot;, and &quot;A&#x27;an&quot;.

In addition, Thoth was also known by specific aspects of himself, for instance the Moon god Iah-Djehuty (&quot;j3ḥ-ḏḥw.ty)&quot;, representing the Moon for the entire month. The Greeks related Thoth to their god Hermes due to his similar attributes and functions. One of Thoth&#x27;s titles, &quot;Thrice great&quot;, was translated to the Greek (&quot;&quot;), making Hermes Trismegistus.

==Depictions==
Thoth has been depicted in many ways depending on the era and on the aspect the artist wished to convey. Usually, he is depicted in his human form with the head of a green ibis. In this form, he can be represented as the reckoner of times and seasons by a headdress of the lunar disk sitting on top of a crescent moon resting on his head. When depicted as a form of Shu or Ankher, he was depicted to be wearing the respective god&#x27;s headdress. Sometimes he was also seen in art to be wearing the Atef crown or the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. When not depicted in this common form, he sometimes takes the form of the ibis directly.

He also appears as a dog-faced baboon or a man with the head of a baboon when he is A&#x27;an, the god of . In the form of A&#x27;ah-Djehuty, he took a more human-looking form. These forms are all symbolic and are metaphors for Thoth&#x27;s attributes. Thoth is often depicted holding an ankh, the Egyptian symbol for life.
==Attributes==
Thoth&#x27;s roles in Egyptian mythology were many. He served as scribe of the gods, credited with the invention of writing and Egyptian hieroglyphs. In the underworld, Duat, he appeared as an ape, Aani, the god of equilibrium, who reported when the scales weighing the deceased&#x27;s heart against the feather, representing the principle of Maat, was exactly even.

The ancient Egyptians regarded Thoth as One, self-begotten, and self-produced. He was the master of both physical and moral (i.e. divine law), making proper use of Ma&#x27;at. He is credited with making the calculations for the establishment of the heavens, stars, Earth, and everything in them.

The Egyptians credited him as the author of all works of science, religion, philosophy, and magic. The Greeks further declared him the inventor of astronomy, astrology, the science of numbers, mathematics, geometry, surveying, medicine, botany, theology, civilized government, the alphabet, reading, writing, and oratory. They further claimed he was the true author of every work of every branch of knowledge, human and divine.

==Mythology==

The Greek philosopher Plutarch credits Thoth with the creation of the 365-day calendar. Originally, according to the myth, the year was only 360 days long and Nut was sterile during these days, unable to bear children. Thoth gambled with the Moon for nd of its light ( = 5), or 5 days, and won. During these 5 days, Nut and Geb gave birth to Osiris, Set, Isis, and Nephthys.

In the central Osiris myth, Thoth gives Isis the words to restore her husband, allowing the pair to conceive Horus. Following a battle between Horus and Set, Thoth offers counsel and provides wisdom.

==History==
Thoth was a Moon god. The Moon not only provides light at night, allowing time to still be measured without the Sun, but its phases and prominence gave it a significant importance in early astrology/astronomy. The perceived cycles of the Moon also organized much of Egyptian society&#x27;s rituals and events, both civil and religious. Consequently, Thoth gradually became seen as a god of wisdom, magic, and the measurement and regulation of events and of time. He was thus said to be the secretary and counselor of the Sun god Ra, and with Ma&#x27;at (truth/order) stood next to Ra on the nightly voyage across the sky.

Thoth became credited by the ancient Egyptians as the inventor of writing (hieroglyphs), and was also considered to have been the scribe of the underworld. For this reason, Thoth was universally worshipped by ancient Egyptian scribes. Many scribes had a painting or a picture of Thoth in their &quot;office&quot;. Likewise, one of the symbols for scribes was that of the ibis.

In art, Thoth was usually depicted with the head of an ibis, possibly because the Egyptians saw the curve of the ibis&#x27; beak as a symbol of the crescent moon. Sometimes, he was depicted as a baboon holding up a crescent moon.

During the Late Period of ancient Egypt, a cult of Thoth gained prominence due to its main center, Khmun (Hermopolis Magna), also becoming the capital. Millions of dead ibis were mummified and buried in his honor.

Thoth was inserted in many tales as the wise counselor and persuader, and his association with learning and measurement led him to be connected with Seshat, the earlier deification of wisdom, who was said to be his daughter, or variably his wife. Thoth&#x27;s qualities also led to him being identified by the Greeks with their closest matching god Hermes, with whom Thoth was eventually combined as Hermes Trismegistus, leading to the Greeks&#x27; naming Thoth&#x27;s cult center as Hermopolis, meaning &quot;city of Hermes&quot;.

In the Papyrus of Ani copy of the Egyptian Book of the Dead the scribe proclaims &quot;I am thy writing palette, O Thoth, and I have brought unto thee thine ink-jar. I am not of those who work iniquity in their secret places; let not evil happen unto me.&quot; Plate XXIX Chapter CLXXV (Budge) of the Book of the Dead is the oldest tradition said to be the work of Thoth himself.

There was also an Egyptian pharaoh of the Sixteenth dynasty named Djehuty (Thoth) after him, and who reigned for three years.

Plato mentions Thoth (as Θεὺθ, &quot;Theuth&quot;) in his dialogue &quot;Phaedrus&quot;. He uses the myth of Thoth to demonstrate that writing leads to laziness and forgetfulness. In the story, Thoth remarks to King Thamus of Egypt that writing is a wonderful substitute for memory. Thamus remarks that it is a remedy for reminding, not remembering, with the appearance but not the reality of wisdom. Future generations will hear much without being properly taught and will appear wise but not be so.

Artapanus of Alexandria, an Egyptian Jew who lived in the third or second century BC, euhemerized Thoth-Hermes as a historical human being and claimed he was the same person as Moses, based primarily on their shared roles as authors of texts and creators of laws. Artapanus&#x27;s biography of Moses conflates traditions about Moses and Thoth and invents many details. Many later authors, from late antiquity to the Renaissance, either identified Hermes Trismegistus with Moses or regarded them as contemporaries who expounded similar beliefs.

=== Archaeology ===
Egypt&#x27;s Minister of Tourism and Antiquities announced the discovery of the collective graves of senior officials and high clergies of the god Thoth in Tuna el-Gebel in Minya in January 2020. An archaeological mission headed by Mostafa Waziri reported that 20 sarcophagi and coffins of various shapes and sizes, including five sarcophagi made of limestone and carved with hieroglyphic texts, as well as 16 tombs and five well-preserved wooden coffins were unearthed by their team.

==Modern cultural references==

<doc id="69038" wikidata="Q723562" url="?curid=69038" title="Peter II, Count of Savoy">
<text>Peter II (c. 120315 May 1268), called the Little Charlemagne, was Count of Savoy from 1263 until his death in 1268. He was also holder of the Honour of Richmond, Yorkshire in England, and the English lands of the Honour of the Eagle also known as the Honour of Pevensey and the Honour of Eu also known as the Honour of Hastings. His significant land holdings in the English County of Sussex were also marked by his holding of the wardship of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey which brought with it lands centred upon Lewes castle. Briefly, from 1241 until 1242, castellan of Dover Castle and Keeper of the Coast (later called Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports). In 1243 he was granted land by the River Thames on the Strand near the City of London, where he built the Savoy Palace.

==Biography==
===Early career in Savoy===
Peter was born around 1203, possibly at Susa, Piedmont. He was likely the seventh child of Thomas I, Count of Savoy and Margaret of Geneva. It was through his sister Beatrice of Savoy and her daughters: Margaret of Provence, Queen of France, Eleanor of Provence, Queen of England, Sanchia of Provence, Queen of the Romans and Beatrice of Provence, Queen of Sicily and Naples, that the House of Savoy and Peter in particular would derive much of their career and influence.

As a younger son of a noble house, Peter started his career in the church, obtaining appointments in dioceses under the influence of his family. From 1226 to 1233 he was a canon at Lausanne, where he was briefly acting bishop before a new permanent bishop was named in 1231. Peter also held the offices of canon at Lyon and of provost at Aosta and Geneva, before retiring from church life in 1234. Upon the death of his father, Peter demanded substantial portions of the county from his eldest brother Amadeus. The brothers met at Chillon in 1234, where they negotiated a settlement which recognized Amadeus as the head of the house. From this, Peter received control of the key castles of the Château de Cornillon at Saint-Rambert-en-Bugey and the Château d&#x27;Angeville at what is now Hauteville-Lompnes also in Bugey. both of which helped him threaten Geneva. His brother William negotiated a marriage for him with Agnes of Faucigny, which also helped provide territory of his own, so he caused less trouble for his elder brothers. The marriage also allowed him to influence Burgundian affairs as Agnes was related to the Joinville family. This relationship brought Geoffrey de Geneville, 1st Baron Geneville, Agnes&#x27;s half-brother, to England. The younger Simon de Joinville, another of Agnes&#x27;s half-brothers, would provide the conduit by which Burgundian knights would serve England both in Gascony and Wales.

His desire to further extend his territory led him into conflict with his uncle, William II of Geneva. Around 1236, Peter was ambushed and captured by his cousin Rudolf. When the resulting conflict was concluded in 1237, Amadeus forced William to sign a treaty which required Geneva to pay 20,000 marks and the castle of Arlod. In 1240, when Peter&#x27;s brother Philip was in a contested election for the Bishop of Lausanne against Jean de Cossonay, a Geneva supported candidate, Peter brought 6000 troops, though the battle did not get resolved decisively.

He continued using both money and force to take further control of lands surrounding Savoy. In May 1244 Rudolph III, Count of Gruyère, surrendered Gruyères Castle to Peter, who then gave it to William, the second son of Rudolph, with the agreement that William and his heirs would serve Peter and his family. On 29 May 1244, Cossonay similarly surrendered significant territories to Peter and Amadeus, retaining them only under the overlordship of Savoy. He continued to gain control of key towns and trade routes throughout the Pays de Vaud, often by enfeofing them to the younger sons of the previous rulers. He was responsible for the significant renovations of the Château de Chillon, and by 1253 he was the protector of Bern. One scholar suggests that French is the language of western Switzerland due partly to Peter&#x27;s extensive conquests in the region.

===English career===
In January 1236, Eleanor of Provence, Peter&#x27;s niece, married King Henry III and Peter came with a number of other Savoyards. On 20 April 1240, Peter was given the Honour of Richmond by Henry III who invited him to England about the end of the year, and knighted him on 5 January 1241 when he became known popularly as Earl of Richmond although he never assumed the title, nor was it ever given to him in official documents. On 25 September 1241 he was granted the Honour of the Eagle and wardship of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey bringing much land in Sussex and the south coast of England. His position on the south coast was further strengthened in 1249 by the Honour of Eu, also known as the Honour of Hastings. In February 1246 he was granted land between the Strand and the Thames, where Peter built the Savoy Palace in 1263, on the site of the present Savoy Hotel. It was destroyed during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381. By his will, the Honour of Richmond was left to his niece Queen Eleanor, who transferred it to the crown.

In 1241, Henry sent Peter to gather support for a pending invasion of Poitou. He travelled to Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy; Theobald I of Navarre; his brother Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy; and his brother-in-law Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence. In February 1242, Peter was sent into Poitou to see what support existed there for Henry. He was nearly captured there, but managed to escape. He then travelled to Provence to negotiate the marriage of his niece Sanchia of Provence to Henry&#x27;s brother Richard.

In 1246, Peter went back to Savoy, in part to seal a marriage deal with Amadeus. In February 1247, he returned to England with Alice of Saluzzo, Amadeus&#x27;s granddaughter by Beatrice. She was married to Edmund de Lacy, Baron of Pontefract that May.

Boston (a borough by 1279), on the River Witham, had over many years become an important port for Lincoln. The town was held by the Dukes of Brittany until about 1200. In 1241, Peter obtained the manor of Boston at the same time as he had Richmond. It was restored to John I, Duke of Brittany, on Peter&#x27;s death. Donington manor is also thought to have been passed from John de la Rye to Peter of Savoy about 1255, when a charter was granted for a market to be held at the manor on Saturdays. In the same year, a similar grant was made for the holding of a fair on 15 August, also to be held at the manor. A separate charter was granted to Peter on 8 April 1255 by the king to hold a market on Mondays.

In 1246, the king granted Peter the castle of Pevensey. Peter originally, in 1258, sided with Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, in the Second Barons&#x27; War; but sided with Eleanor of Provence, his niece and his son-in-law King Henry III of England from 1261 against Montfort.

===English Reform and Second Baronial War===

Peter of Savoy played an important role in the events which led to the Provisions of Oxford in England in 1258 which would lead to the Second Barons&#x27; War. Prior to the formal demands made in Westminster of King Henry III on 30 April 1258, a number of barons had made a solemn oath on 12 April 1258 to assist each other in supporting the reform of the realm. These oath takers would form the core of the baronial movement supporting reform, and were “Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester; Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk; Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester; Peter of Savoy; Hugh Bigod; John fitz Geoffrey; and Peter of Montfort.” Peter of Savoy sided with the reforming barons in order to reduce the political influence of the Lusignan half brothers of King Henry III who were in the view of Peter and his niece, the Queen Eleanor of Provence exerting undue influence at court. However, Peter broke with the reformers in 1260 when Montfort had him removed from the ruling council. Thereafter Peter of Savoy spent an increasing time in Savoy until becoming Count of Savoy in 1263.

Following the Battle of Evesham in 1265 Pevensey Castle and Richmond Castle were besieged by the Monfortian government. Both castles were held by Peter’s constables and stewards. Pevensey Castle in particular received a resupply of men and material from Peter in Flanders. Peter and Eleanor of Provence had gathered an army in Flanders to invade England to restore King Henry III to his throne. The escape of Lord Edward and subsequent Battle of Evesham rendered the invasion unnecessary.

===Count of Savoy===

When Peter&#x27;s nephew Boniface, Count of Savoy, died without heirs in 1263, the question of the succession to Savoy lay unanswered. Besides Peter, there was another possible claimant, the fifteen-year-old Thomas III of Piedmont (1248–82), the eldest son of Peter&#x27;s elder brother Thomas, Count of Flanders. Peter returned to Savoy and was recognised as count over his nephew. This led to a dispute between Savoy and Piedmont that was to outlast Peter and Thomas.

Peter brought many ideas back from his travels around Europe to improve Savoy. He started building castles with a more round form, rather than the square which had existed to that point in Savoy. He divided the county into bailis and divided those into castellanies. He also established an office of accounts at Chambéry to more completely manage financial matters. He was the first count of Savoy to issue laws to cover the whole county. These statutes included the provision that his judges not delay justice which is attributable to the Magna Carta in England

Peter came into conflict with Rudolf of Habsburg, and Henri of Raron, Bishop of Sion.

Peter died without a male heir in 1268, at the castle of Pierre-Châtel, now in Virignin, and was buried in Hautecombe Abbey. His will left his English lands to Eleanor of Provence, the Queen of England, his niece, modified by a codicil which left his Sussex lands to his nephews, Amadeus and Louis. These bequests were the subject of modification by King Henry III of England who had given the Honour of Richmond to his son-in-law, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond and the Sussex lands to the Lord Edward. But as per his will, he was succeeded as Count of Savoy by his remaining brother, Philip, former procurator and archbishop-elect of Lyon.

==Marriage and issue==
Peter&#x27;s marriage was to Agnes of Faucigny in 1236.Agnes was the daughter of Aymon II de Faucigny and Béatrice d&#x27;Auxonne. The marriage brought the House of Savoy increasing influence in Faucigny which lay south east of Geneva and had hitherto been within the sphere of influence of the Count of Geneva. It also brought influence within the Free County of Burgundy through his mother-in-law Béatrice. The subsequent marriage of Béatrice d&#x27;Auxonne to Simon de Joinville extended Peter&#x27;s influence further to include their children Geoffrey de Geneville, 1st Baron Geneville, whom Peter introduced to the English court, and Simon de Joinville, the Seigneur de Gex.

They had one daughter, Beatrice, who inherited Faucigny from her mother. The marriage alliance with the County of Albon, also known as the Dauphiné, whilst advantageous at the time, created long term problems for the County of Savoy when Albon became a part of France. This created a French claim to Faucigny whose territory lay in the middle of Savoy.

<text>Creosote is a category of carbonaceous chemicals formed by the distillation of various tars and pyrolysis of plant-derived material, such as wood, or fossil fuel. They are typically used as preservatives or antiseptics.

Some creosote types were used historically as a treatment for components of seagoing and outdoor wood structures to prevent rot (e.g., bridgework and railroad ties, see image). Samples may be found commonly inside chimney flues, where the coal or wood burns under variable conditions, producing soot and tarry smoke. Creosotes are the principal chemicals responsible for the stability, scent, and flavor characteristic of smoked meat; the name is derived .

The two main kinds recognized in industry are [[coal tar|coal-tar]] creosote and [[tar|wood-tar]] creosote. The coal-tar variety, having stronger and more toxic properties, has chiefly been used as a preservative for wood; coal-tar creosote was also formerly used as an escharotic, to burn malignant skin tissue, and in dentistry, to prevent necrosis, before its carcinogenic properties became known. The wood-tar variety has been used for meat preservation, ship treatment, and such medical purposes as an anaesthetic, antiseptic, astringent, expectorant, and laxative, though these have mostly been replaced by modern formulations.

Varieties of creosote have also been made from both oil shale and petroleum, and are known as oil-tar creosote when derived from oil tar, and as water-gas-tar creosote when derived from the tar of water gas. Creosote also has been made from pre-coal formations such as lignite, yielding lignite-tar creosote, and peat, yielding peat-tar creosote.

==Creosote oils==
The term creosote has a broad range of definitions depending on the origin of the coal tar oil and end-use of the material.

With respect to wood preservatives, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers the term &quot;creosote&quot; to mean a pesticide for use as a wood preservative meeting the American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) Standards P1/P13 and P2. The AWPA Standards require that creosote &quot;shall be a pure coal tar product derived entirely from tar produced by the carbonization of bituminous coal.&quot;

Currently, all creosote-treated wood products—foundation and marine pilings, lumber, posts, railroad ties, timbers, and utility poles—are manufactured using this type of wood preservative. The manufacturing process can only be a pressure process under the supervision of a licensed applicator certified by the State Departments of Agriculture. No brush-on, spray, or non-pressure uses of creosote are allowed, as specified by the EPA-approved label for the use of creosote.

The use of creosote according to the AWPA Standards does not allow for mixing with other types of &quot;creosote type&quot; materials—such as lignite-tar creosote, oil-tar creosote, peat-tar creosote, water-gas-tar creosote, or wood-tar creosote. The AWPA Standard P3 does however, allow blending of a high-boiling petroleum oil meeting the AWPA Standard P4.

The information that follows describing the other various types of creosote materials and its uses should be considered as primarily being of only historical value. This history is important, because it traces the origin of these different materials used during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Furthermore, it must be considered that these other types of creosotes – lignite-tar, wood-tar, water-gas-tar, etc. – are not currently being manufactured and have either been replaced with more-economical materials, or replaced by products that are more efficacious or safer.

For some part of their history, coal-tar creosote and wood-tar creosote were thought to have been equivalent substances—albeit of distinct origins—accounting for their common name; the two were determined only later to be chemically different. All types of creosote are composed of phenol derivatives and share some quantity of monosubstituted phenols, but these are not the only active element of creosote. For their useful effects, coal-tar creosote relies on the presence of naphthalenes and anthracenes, while wood-tar creosote relies on the presence of methyl ethers of phenol. Otherwise, either type of tar would dissolve in water.

Creosote was first discovered in its wood-tar form in 1832, by Carl Reichenbach, when he found it both in the tar and in pyroligneous acids obtained by a dry distillation of beechwood. Because pyroligneous acid was known as an antiseptic and meat preservative, Reichenbach conducted experiments by dipping meat in a dilute solution of distilled creosote. He found that the meat was dried without undergoing putrefaction and had attained a smoky flavor. This led him to reason that creosote was the antiseptic component contained in smoke, and he further argued that the creosote he had found in wood tar was also in coal tar, as well as amber tar and animal tar, in the same abundance as in wood tar.

Soon afterward, in 1834, Friedrich Ferdinand Runge discovered carbolic acid (phenol) in coal-tar, and Auguste Laurent obtained it from &quot;phenylhydrate&quot;, which was soon determined to be the same compound. There was no clear view on the relationship between carbolic acid and creosote; Runge described it as having similar caustic and antiseptic properties, but noted that it was different, in that it was an acid and formed salts. Nonetheless, Reichenbach argued that creosote was also the active element, as it was in pyroligneous acid. Despite evidence to the contrary, his view held sway with most chemists, and it became commonly accepted wisdom that creosote, carbolic acid, and phenylhydrate were identical substances, with different degrees of purity.

Carbolic acid was soon commonly sold under the name &quot;creosote&quot;, and the scarcity of wood-tar creosote in some places led chemists to believe that it was the same substance as that described by Reichenbach. In the 1840s, Eugen Freiherr von Gorup-Besanez, after realizing that two samples of substances labelled as creosote were different, started a series of investigations to determine the chemical nature of carbolic acid, leading to a conclusion that it more resembled chlorinated quinones and must have been a different, entirely unrelated substance.

Independently, there were investigations into the chemical nature of creosote. A study by F.K. Völkel revealed that the smell of purified creosote resembled that of guaiacol, and later studies by Heinrich Hlasiwetz identified a substance common to guaiacum and creosote that he called creosol, and he determined that creosote contained a mixture of creosol and guaiacol. Later investigations by Gorup-Besanez, A.E. Hoffmann, and Siegfried Marasse showed that wood-tar creosote also contained phenols, giving it a feature in common with coal-tar creosote.

Historically, coal-tar creosote has been distinguished from what was thought of as creosote proper—the original substance of Reichenbach&#x27;s discovery—and it has been referred to specifically as &quot;creosote oil&quot;. But, because creosote from coal-tar and wood-tar are obtained from a similar process and have some common uses, they have also been placed in the same class of substances, with the terms &quot;creosote&quot; or &quot;creosote oil&quot; referring to either product.

===Wood-tar creosote===

Wood-tar creosote is a colourless to yellowish greasy liquid with a smoky odor, produces a sooty flame when burned, and has a burned taste. It is non-buoyant in water, with a specific gravity of 1.037 to 1.087, retains fluidity at a very low temperature, and boils at 205-225 °C. In its purest form, it is transparent. Dissolution in water requires up to 200 times the amount of water as the base creosote. This creosote is a combination of natural phenols: primarily guaiacol and creosol (4-methylguaiacol), which typically constitutes 50% of the oil; second in prevalence are cresol and xylenol; the rest being a combination of monophenols and polyphenols.

The simple phenols are not the only active element in wood-tar creosote. In solution, they coagulate albumin, which is a water-soluble protein found in meat, so they serve as a preserving agent, but also cause denaturation. Most of the phenols in the creosote are methoxy derivatives: they contain the methoxy group linked to the benzene nucleus. The high level of methyl derivates created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the methyl alcohol produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from coal-tar creosote. Guaiacol is a methyl ether of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a methyl ether of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin. Methyl ethers differ from simple phenols in being less hydrophilic, caustic, and poisonous. This allows meat to be successfully preserved without tissue denaturation, and allows creosote to be used as a medical ointment.

Because wood-tar creosote is used for its guaiacol and creosol content, it is generally derived from beechwood rather than other woods, since it distills with a higher proportion of those chemicals to other phenolics. The creosote can be obtained by distilling the wood tar and treating the fraction heavier than water with a sodium hydroxide solution. The alkaline solution is then separated from the insoluble oily layer, boiled in contact with air to reduce impurities, and decomposed by diluted sulfuric acid. This produces a crude creosote, which is purified by re-solution in alkali, re-precipitation with acid, then redistilled with the fraction passing over between 200° and 225° constituting the purified creosote.

When ferric chloride is added to a dilute solution, it will turn green: a characteristic of ortho-oxy derivatives of benzene. It dissolves in sulfuric acid to a red liquid, which slowly changes to purple-violet. Shaken with hydrochloric acid in the absence of air, it becomes red, the color changing in the presence of air to dark brown or black.

In preparation of food by smoking, guaiacol contributes mainly to the smoky taste, while the dimethyl ether of pyrogallol, syringol, is the main chemical responsible for the smoky aroma.

====Historical uses====

=====Industrial=====
Soon after it was discovered and recognized as the principle of meat smoking, wood-tar creosote became used as a replacement for the process. Several methods were used to apply the creosote. One was to dip the meat in pyroligneous acid or a water of diluted creosote, as Reichenbach did, or brush it over with them, and within one hour the meat would have the same quality of that of traditionally smoked preparations. Sometimes the creosote was diluted in vinegar rather than water, as vinegar was also used as a preservative. Another was to place the meat in a closed box, and place with it a few drops of creosote in a small bottle. Because of the volatility of the creosote, the atmosphere was filled with a vapour containing it, and it would cover the flesh.

The application of wood tar to seagoing vessels was practiced through the 18th century and early 19th century, before the creosote was isolated as a compound. Wood-tar creosote was found not to be as effective in wood treatments, because it was harder to infuse the creosote into the wood cells, but still experiments were done, including by many governments, because it proved to be less expensive on the market.

=====Medical=====
Even before creosote as a chemical compound was discovered, it was the chief active component of medicinal remedies in different cultures around the world.

In antiquity, pitches and resins were used commonly as medicines. Pliny mentions a variety of tar-like substances being used as medicine, including &quot;cedria&quot; and &quot;pissinum&quot;. &quot;Cedria&quot; was the pitch and resin of the cedar tree, being equivalent to the oil of tar and pyroligneous acid which are used in the first stage of distilling creosote. He recommends cedria to ease the pain in a toothache, as an injection in the ear in case of hardness of hearing, to kill parasitic worms, as a preventive for infusion, as a treatment for phthiriasis and , as an antidote for the poison of the sea hare, as a liniment for elephantiasis, and as an ointment to treat ulcers both on the skin and in the lungs. He further speaks of cedria being used as the embalming agent for preparing mummies. &quot;Pissinum&quot; was a tar water that was made by boiling cedria, spreading wool fleeces over the vessels to catch the steam, and then wringing them out.
The &quot;Pharmacopée de Lyon&quot;, published in 1778, says that cedar tree oil is believed to cure vomiting and help medicate tumors and ulcers. Physicians contemporary to the discovery of creosote recommended ointments and pills made from tar or pitch to treat skin diseases. Tar water had been used as a folk remedy since the Middle Ages to treat affections like dyspepsia. Bishop Berkeley wrote several works on the medical virtues of tar water, including a philosophical work in 1744 titled &quot;Siris: a chain of philosophical reflexions and inquiries concerning the virtues of tar water, and divers other subjects connected together and arising one from another&quot;, and a poem where he praised its virtues. Pyroligneous acid was also used at the time in a medicinal water called &quot;Aqua Binelli&quot; (Binelli&#x27;s water), a compound which its inventor, the Italian Fedele Binelli, claimed to have hemostatic properties in his research published in 1797. These claims have since been disproven.

Given this history, and the antiseptic properties known to creosote, it became popular among physicians in the 19th century. A dilution of creosote in water was sold in pharmacies as &quot;Aqua creosoti&quot;, as suggested by the previous use of pyroligneous acid. It was prescribed to quell the irritability of the stomach and bowels and detoxify, treat ulcers and abscesses, neutralize bad odors, and stimulate the mucous tissues of the mouth and throat. Creosote in general was listed as an irritant, styptic, antiseptic, narcotic, and diuretic, and in small doses when taken internally as a sedative and anaesthetic. It was used to treat ulcers, and as a way to sterilize the tooth and deaden the pain in case of a tooth-ache.

Creosote was suggested as a treatment for tuberculosis by Reichenbach as early as 1833. Following Reichenbach, it was argued for by John Elliotson and Sir John Rose Cormack. Elliotson, inspired by the use of creosote to arrest vomiting during an outbreak of cholera, suggested its use for tuberculosis through inhalation. He also suggested it for epilepsy, neuralgia, diabetes, and chronic glanders. The idea of using it for tuberculosis failed to be accepted. Use for this purpose was dropped, until the idea was revived in 1876 by British doctor G. Anderson Imlay, who suggested it be applied locally by spray to the bronchial mucous membrane. This was followed up in 1877 when it was argued for in a clinical paper by Charles Bouchard and Henri Gimbert. Germ theory had been established by Pasteur in 1860, and Bouchard, arguing that a bacillus was responsible for the disease, sought to rehabilitate creosote for its use as an antiseptic to treat it. He began a series of trials with Gimbert to convince the scientific community, and claimed a promising cure rate. A number of publications in Germany confirmed his results in the following years.

Later, a period of experimentation with different techniques and chemicals using creosote in treating tuberculosis lasted until about 1910, when radiation therapy seemed more promising. Guaiacol, instead of a full creosote solution, was suggested by Hermann Sahli in 1887. He argued it had the active chemical of creosote and had the advantage of being of definite composition and having a less unpleasant taste and odor. A number of solutions of both creosote and guaiacol appeared on the market, such as &quot;phosphotal&quot; and &quot;guaicophosphal&quot;, phosphites of creosote and guaiacol; &quot;eosot&quot; and &quot;geosot&quot;, valerinates of creosote and guaicol; &quot;phosot&quot; and &quot;taphosot&quot;, phosphate and tannophospate of creosote; and &quot;creosotal&quot; and &quot;tanosal&quot;, tannates of creosote. Creosote and eucalyptus oil were also a remedy used together, administered through a vaporizor and inhaler. Since then, more effective and safer treatments for tuberculosis have been developed.

In the 1940s, Canadian-based Eldon Boyd experimented with guaiacol and a recent synthetic modification—glycerol guaiacolate (guaifenesin)—on animals. His data showed that both drugs were effective in increasing secretions into the airways in laboratory animals, when high-enough doses were given.

====Current uses====

=====Industrial=====
Wood-tar creosote is to some extent used for wood preservation, but it is generally mixed with coal-tar creosote, since the former is not as effective. Commercially available preparations of &quot;liquid smoke&quot;, marketed to add a smoked flavour to meat and aid as a preservative, consist primarily of creosote and other constituents of smoke. Creosote is the ingredient that gives liquid smoke its function; guaicol lends to the taste and the creosote oils help act as the preservative. Creosote can be destroyed by treatment with chlorine, either sodium hypochlorite, or calcium hypochlorite solutions. The phenol ring is essentially opened, and the molecule is then subject to normal digestion and normal respiration.

=====Medical=====
The guaifenesin developed by Eldon Boyd is still commonly used today as an expectorant, sold over the counter, and usually taken by mouth to assist the bringing up of phlegm from the airways in acute respiratory tract infections. Guaifenesin is a component of Mucinex, Robitussin DAC, Cheratussin DAC, Robitussin AC, Cheratussin AC, Benylin, DayQuil Mucous Control, Meltus, and Bidex 400.

Seirogan is a popular Kampo medicine in Japan, used as an anti-diarrheal, and has 133 mg wood creosote from beech, pine, maple or oak wood per adult dose as its primary ingredient. Seirogan was first used as a gastrointestinal medication by the Imperial Japanese Army in Russia during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 to 1905.

Creomulsion is a cough medicine in the United States, introduced in 1925, that is still sold and contains beechwood creosote. Beechwood creosote is also found under the name &quot;kreosotum&quot; or &quot;kreosote&quot;.

===Coal-tar creosote===

Coal-tar creosote is greenish-brown liquid, with different degrees of darkness, viscosity, and fluorescence depending on how it is made. When freshly made, the creosote is a yellow oil with a greenish cast and highly fluorescent, and the fluorescence is increased by exposure to air and light. After settling, the oil is dark green by reflected light and dark red by transmitted light. To the naked eye, it generally appears brown. The creosote (often called &quot;creosote oil&quot;) consists almost wholly of aromatic hydrocarbons, with some amount of bases and acids and other neutral oils. The flash point is 70–75 °C and burning point is 90–100 °C, and when burned it releases a greenish smoke. The smell largely depends on the naphtha content in the creosote. If there is a high amount, it will have a naphtha-like smell, otherwise it will smell more of tar.

In the process of coal-tar distillation, the distillate is collected into four fractions; the &quot;light oil&quot;, which remains lighter than water, the &quot;middle oil&quot; which passes over when the light oil is removed; the &quot;heavy oil&quot;, which sinks; and the &quot;anthracene oil&quot;, which when cold is mostly solid and greasy, of a buttery consistence. Creosote refers to the portion of coal tar which distills as &quot;heavy oil&quot;, typically between 230 and 270 °C, also called &quot;dead oil&quot;; it sinks into water but still is fairly liquid. Carbolic acid is produced in the second fraction of distillation and is often distilled into what is referred to as &quot;carbolic oil&quot;.

Commercial creosote contains substances from six groups. The two groups occur in the greatest amounts and are the products of the distillation process—the &quot;tar acids&quot;, which distill below 205 °C and consist mainly of phenols, cresols, and xylenols, including carbolic acid—and aromatic hydrocarbons, which divide into naphthalenes, which distill approximately between 205 and 255 °C, and constituents of an anthracene nature, which distill above 255 °C. The quantity of each varies based on the quality of tar and temperatures used, but generally, the tar acids won&#x27;t exceed 5%, the naphthalenes make up 15 to 50%, and the anthracenes make up 45% to 70%. The hydrocarbons are mainly aromatic; derivatives of benzene and related cyclic compounds such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, acenaphthene, and fluorene. Creosotes from vertical-retort and low temperature tars contain, in addition, some paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons. The tar-acid content also depends on the source of the tar—it may be less than 3% in creosote from coke-oven tar and as high as 32% in creosote from vertical retort tar. All of these have antiseptic properties. The tar acids are the strongest antiseptics but have the highest degree of solubility in water and are the most volatile; so, like with wood-tar creosote, phenols are not the most valued component, as by themselves they would lend to being poor preservatives. In addition, creosote contains several products naturally occurring in coal—nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as acridines, carbazoles, and quinolines, referred to as the &quot;tar bases&quot; and generally make up about 3% of the creosote—sulfur-containing heterocycles, generally benzothiophenes—and oxygen-containing heterocycles, dibenzofurans. Lastly, creosote contains a small number of aromatic amines produced by the other substances during the distillation process and likely resulting from a combination of thermolysis and hydrogenation. The tar bases are often extracted by washing the creosote with aqueous mineral acid, although they&#x27;re also suggested to have antiseptic ability similar to the tar acids.

Commercially used creosote is often treated to extract the carbolic acid, naphthalene, or anthracene content. The carbolic acid or naphthalene is generally extracted to be used in other commercial products. In the early 20th century, American-produced creosote oils typically had low amounts of anthracene and high amounts of naphthalene, because when forcing the distillate at a temperature that produces anthracene the soft pitch will be ruined and only the hard pitch will remain; this ruined it for use in roofing purposes (which was common before widespread availability of cheap oil bitumen) and only left a product which wasn&#x27;t commercially useful.

====Historical uses====

=====Industrial=====
The use of coal-tar creosote on a commercial scale began in 1838, when a patent covering the use of creosote oil to treat timber was taken out by inventor John Bethell. The &quot;Bethell process&quot;—or as it later became known, the full-cell process—involves placing wood to be treated in a sealed chamber and applying a vacuum to remove air and moisture from wood &quot;cells&quot;. The wood is then pressure-treated to imbue it with creosote or other preservative chemicals, after which vacuum is reapplied to separate the excess treatment chemicals from the timber. Alongside the zinc chloride-based &quot;Burnett process&quot;, use of creosoted wood prepared by the Bethell process became a principal way of preserving railway timbers (most notably railway sleepers) to increase the lifespan of the timbers, and avoiding having to regularly replace them.

Besides treating wood, it was also used for lighting and fuel. In the beginning, it was only used for lighting needed in harbour and outdoor work, where the smoke that was produced from burning it was of little inconvenience. By 1879, lamps had been created that ensured a more complete combustion by using compressed air, removing the drawback of the smoke. Creosote was also processed into gas and used for lighting that way. As a fuel, it was used to power ships at sea and blast furnaces for different industrial needs, once it was discovered to be more efficient than unrefined coal or wood. It was also used industrially for the softening of hard pitch, and burned to produce lamp black. By 1890, the production of creosote in the United Kingdom totaled approximately 29,900,000 gallons per year.

In 1854, Alexander McDougall and Robert Angus Smith developed and patented a product called McDougall&#x27;s Powder as a sewer deodorant; it mainly consisted of carbolic acid derived from creosote. McDougall, in 1864, experimented with his solution to remove entozoa parasites from cattle pasturing on a sewage farm. This later led to widespread use of creosote as a cattle wash and sheep dip. External parasites would be killed in a creosote diluted dip, and drenching tubes would be used to administer doses to the animals&#x27; stomachs to kill internal parasites.
Creosoted wood blocks were a common road-paving material in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but ultimately fell out of favor because they did not generally hold up well enough over time.

Two later methods for creosoting wood were introduced after the turn of the century, referred to as empty-cell processes, because they involve compressing the air inside the wood so that the preservative can only coat the inner cell walls rather than saturating the interior cell voids. This is a less effective, though usually satisfactory, method of treating the wood, but is used because it requires less of the creosoting material. The first method, the &quot;Rüping process&quot; was patented in 1902, and the second, the &quot;Lowry process&quot; was patented in 1906. Later in 1906, the &quot;Allardyce process&quot; and &quot;Card process&quot; were patented to treat wood with a combination of both creosote and zinc chloride. In 1912, it was estimated that a total of 150,000,000 gallons were produced in the US per year.

=====Medical=====
Coal-tar creosote, despite its toxicity, was used as a stimulant and escharotic, as a caustic agent used to treat ulcers and malignancies, cauterize wounds, and prevent infection and decay. It was particularly used in dentistry to destroy tissues and arrest necrosis.

====Current uses====

=====Industrial=====
Coal-tar creosote is the most widely used wood treatment today; both industrially, processed into wood using pressure methods such as &quot;full-cell process&quot; or &quot;empty-cell process&quot;, and more commonly applied to wood through brushing. In addition to toxicity to fungi, insects, and marine borers, it serves as a natural water repellent. It is commonly used to preserve and waterproof railroad ties, pilings, telephone poles, power line poles, marine pilings, and fence posts. Although suitable for use in preserving the structural timbers of buildings, it is not generally used that way because it is difficult to apply. There are also concerns about the environmental impact of the leaching of creosote into aquatic ecosystems.

Due to its carcinogenic character, the European Union has regulated the quality of creosote for the EU market and requires that the sale of creosote be limited to professional users. The United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates the use of coal-tar creosote as a wood preservative under the provisions of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Creosote is considered a restricted-use pesticide and is only available to licensed pesticide applicators.

===Oil-tar creosote===

Oil-tar creosote is derived from the tar that forms when using petroleum or shale oil in the manufacturing of gas. The distillation of the tar from the oil occurs at very high temperatures; around 980 °C. The tar forms at the same time as the gas, and once processed for creosotes contains a high percentage of cyclic hydrocarbons, a very low amount of tar acids and tar bases, and no true anthracenes have been identified. Historically, this has mainly been produced in the United States on the Pacific coast, where petroleum has been more abundant than coal. Limited quantities have been used industrially, either alone, mixed with coal-tar creosote, or fortified with pentachlorophenol.

===Water-gas-tar creosote===
Water-gas-tar creosote is also derived from petroleum oil or shale oil, but by a different process; it is distilled during the production of water gas. The tar is a by-product resulting from enrichment of water gas with gases produced by thermal decomposition of petroleum. Of the creosotes derived from oil, it is practically the only one used for wood preservation. It has the same degree of solubility as coal-tar creosote and is easy to infuse into wood. Like standard oil-tar creosote, it has a low amount of tar acids and tar bases, and has less antiseptic qualities. Petri dish tests have shown that water-gas-tar creosote is one-sixth as anti-septically effective as that of coal-tar.

===Lignite-tar creosote===
Lignite-tar creosote is produced from lignite rather than bituminous coal, and varies considerably from coal-tar creosote. Also called &quot;lignite oil&quot;, it has a very high content of tar acids, and has been used to increase the tar acids in normal creosote when necessary. When it has been produced, it has generally been applied in mixtures with coal-tar creosote or petroleum. Its effectiveness when used alone has not been established. In an experiment with southern yellow pine fence posts in Mississippi, straight lignite-tar creosote was giving good results after about 27 years exposure, although not as good as the standard coal-tar creosote used in the same situation.

===Peat-tar creosote===
There have also been attempts to distill creosote from peat-tar, although mostly unsuccessful due to the problems with winning and drying peat on an industrial scale. Peat tar by itself has in the past been used as a wood preservative.

==Health effects==
According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), eating food or drinking water contaminated with high levels of coal-tar creosote may cause a burning in the mouth and throat, and stomach pains. ATSDR also states that brief direct contact with large amounts of coal-tar creosote may result in a rash or severe irritation of the skin, chemical burns of the surfaces of the eyes, convulsions and mental confusion, kidney or liver problems, unconsciousness, and even death. Longer direct skin contact with low levels of creosote mixtures or their vapours can result in increased light sensitivity, damage to the cornea, and skin damage. Longer exposure to creosote vapours can cause irritation of the respiratory tract.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that coal-tar creosote is probably carcinogenic to humans, based on adequate animal evidence and limited human evidence. The animal testing relied upon by IARC involved the continuous application of creosote to the shaved skin of rodents. After weeks of creosote application, the animals developed cancerous skin lesions and in one test, lesions of the lung. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has stated that coal-tar creosote is a probable human carcinogen based on both human and animal studies. As a result, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set a permissible exposure limit of 0.2 milligrams of coal-tar creosote per cubic meter of air (0.2 mg/m3) in the workplace during an 8-hour day, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that spills or accidental releases into the environment of one pound (0.454 kg) or more of creosote be reported to them.

There is no unique exposure pathway of children to creosote. Children exposed to creosote probably experience the same health effects seen in adults exposed to creosote. It is unknown whether children differ from adults in their susceptibility to health effects from creosote.

A 2005 mortality study of creosote workers found no evidence supporting an increased risk of cancer death, as a result of exposure to creosote. Based on the findings of the largest mortality study to date of workers employed in creosote wood treating plants, there is no evidence that employment at creosote wood-treating plants or exposure to creosote-based preservatives was associated with any significant mortality increase from either site-specific cancers or non-malignant diseases. The study consisted of 2,179 employees at eleven plants in the United States where wood was treated with creosote preservatives. Some workers began work in the 1940s to 1950s. The observation period of the study covered 1979–2001. The average length of employment was 12.5 years. One third of the study subjects were employed for over 15 years.

The largest health effect of creosote is deaths caused by residential chimney fires due to chimney tar (creosote) build-up. This is entirely unconnected with its industrial production or use.

==Build-up in chimneys==
Burning wood and fossil fuels in the absence of adequate airflow (such as in an enclosed furnace or stove), causes incomplete combustion of the oils in the wood, which are off-gassed as volatiles in the smoke. As the smoke rises through the chimney it cools, causing water, carbon, and volatiles to condense on the interior surfaces of the chimney flue. The black oily residue that builds up is referred to as creosote, which is similar in composition to the commercial products by the same name, but with a higher content of carbon black.

Over the course of a season creosote deposits can become several inches thick. This creates a compounding problem, because the creosote deposits reduce the draft (airflow through the chimney) which increases the probability that the wood fire is not getting enough air for complete combustion. Since creosote is highly combustible, a thick accumulation creates a fire hazard. If a hot fire is built in the stove or fireplace, and the air control left wide open, this may allow hot oxygen into the chimney where it comes in contact with the creosote which then ignites—causing a chimney fire. Chimney fires often spread to the main building because the chimney gets so hot that it ignites any combustible material in direct contact with it, such as wood. The fire can also spread to the main building from sparks emitting from the chimney and landing on combustible roof surfaces. In order to properly maintain chimneys and heaters that burn wood or carbon-based fuels, the creosote buildup must be removed. Chimney sweeps perform this service for a fee.

==Release into environment==

Even though creosote is pressurized into the wood, the release of the chemical – and resulting marine pollution – occurs due to many different events: During the lifetime of the marine piling, weathering occurs from tides and water flow which slowly opens the oily outer coating and exposes the smaller internal pores to more water flow. Frequent weathering occurs daily, but more severe weather, such as hurricanes, can cause damage or loosening of the wooden pilings. Many pilings are either broken into pieces from debris, or are completely washed away during these storms. When the pilings are washed away, they come to settle on the bottom of the body of water where they reside, and then they leach chemicals into the water slowly over a long period of time. This long-term secretion is not normally noticed because the piling is submerged beneath the surface, hidden from sight.

The creosote is mostly insoluble in water, but the lower-molecular-weight compounds will become soluble the longer the broken wood is exposed to the water. In this case, some of the chemicals become water-soluble and further leach into the aquatic sediment while the rest of the insoluble chemicals remain together in a tar-like substance. Another source of damage comes from wood-boring fauna, such as shipworms and &quot;Limnoria&quot;. Though creosote is used as a pesticide preservative, studies have shown that Limnoria is resistant to wood preservative pesticides and can cause small holes in the wood, through which creosote can then be released.

==Chemical reactions with sediment and organisms==
Once the soluble compounds from the creosote preservative leach into the water, the compounds begin reacting with the external environment or are consumed by organisms. The reactions vary depending on the concentration of each compound that is released from the creosote, but major reactions are outlined below:

===Alkylation===
Alkylation occurs when a molecule replaces a hydrogen atom with an alkyl group that generally comes from an organic molecule. Alkyl groups that are found naturally occurring in the environment are organometallic compounds. Organometallic compounds generally contain a methyl, ethyl, or butyl derivative which is the alkyl group that replaces the hydrogen. Other organic compounds, such as methanol, can provide alkyl groups for alkylation. Methanol is found naturally in the environment in small concentrations, and has been linked to the release from biological decomposition of waste and even a byproduct of vegetation. The following reactions are alkylations of soluble compounds found in creosote preservatives with methanol.

====m-Cresol====
The diagram above depicts a reaction between m-cresol and methanol where a c-alkylation product is produced. The c-alkylation reaction means that instead of replacing the hydrogen atom on the -OH group, the methyl group (from the methanol) replaces the hydrogen on a carbon in the benzene ring. The products of this c-alkylation can be in either a para- or ortho- orientation on the molecule, as seen in the diagram, and water, which is not shown. Isomers of the dimethylphenol (DMP) compound are the products of the para- and ortho-c-alkylation. Dimethylphenol (DMP) compound is listed as an aquatic hazard by characteristic, and is toxic with long lasting effects.

====Phenol====
This diagram shows an o-alkylation between phenol and methanol. Unlike the c-alkylation, the o-alkylation replaces the hydrogen atom on the -OH group with the methyl group (from the methanol). The product of the o-alkylation is methoxybenzene, better-known as anisole, and water, which is not shown in the diagram. Anisole is listed as an acute hazard to aquatic life with long-term effects.

===Bioaccumulation===
Bioaccumulation is the process by which an organism takes in chemicals through ingestion, exposure, and inhalation. Bioaccumulation is broken down into bioconcentration (uptake of chemicals from the environment) and biomagnification (increasing concentration of chemicals as they move up the food chain). Certain species of aquatic organisms are affected differently from the chemicals released from creosote preservatives. One of the more studied organisms is a mollusk. Mollusks attach to the wooden, marine pilings and are in direct contact with the creosote preservatives. Many studies have been conducted using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are low molecular hydrocarbons found in some creosote-based preservatives. In a study conducted from Pensacola, Florida, a group of native mollusks were kept in a controlled environment, and a different group of native mollusks were kept in an environment contaminated with creosote preservatives. The mollusks in the contaminated environment were shown to have a bioaccumulation of up to ten times the concentration of PAH than the control species. The intake of organisms is dependent on whether the compound is in an ionized or an un-ionized form. To determine whether the compound is ionized or un-ionized, the pH of the surrounding environment must be compared to the pKa or acidity constant of the compound. If the pH of the environment is lower than the pKa, then the compound is un-ionized which means that the compound will behave as if it is non-polar. Bioaccumulation for un-ionized compounds comes from partitioning equilibrium between the aqueous phase and the lipids in the organism. If the pH is higher than the pKa, then the compound is considered to be in the ionized form. The un-ionized form is favored because the bioaccumulation is easier for the organism to intake through partitioning equilibrium. The table below shows a list of pKas from compounds found in creosote preservatives and compares them to the average pH of seawater (reported to be 8.1).
Each of the compounds in the table above is found in creosote preservatives; all are in the favored un-ionized form. In another study, various species of small fish were tested to see how the exposure time to PAH chemicals affected the fish. This study showed that an exposure time of 24–96 hours on various shrimp and fish species affected the growth, reproduction, and survival functions of the organisms for most of the compounds tested.

===Biodegradation===
It can be seen in some studies that biodegradation accounts for the absence of creosote preservatives on the initial surface of the sediment. In a study from Pensacola, Florida, PAHs were not detected on the surface on the aquatic sediment, but the highest concentrations were detected at a depth of 8-13 centimeters. A form an anaerobic biodegradation of m-cresol was seen in a study using sulfate-reducing and nitrate-reducing enriched environments. The reduction of m-cresol in this study was seen in under 144 hours, while additional chemical intermediates were being formed. The chemical intermediates were formed in the presence of bicarbonate. The products included 4-hydroxy-2-methylbenzoic acid and acetate compounds. Although the conditions were enriched with the reducing anaerobic compounds, sulfate and nitrate reducing bacteria are commonly found in the environment. For further information, see sulfate-reducing bacteria. The type of anaerobic bacteria ultimately determines the reduction of the creosote preservative compounds, while each individual compound may only go through reduction under certain conditions. BTEX is a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, that was studied in the presence of four different anaerobic-enriched sediments. Though the compound, BTEX, is not found in creosote preservatives, the products of creosote preservatives&#x27; oxidation-reduction reactions include some of these compounds. For oxidation-reduction reactions, see the following section. In this study, it was seen that certain compounds such as benzene were only reduced under sulfate-enriched environments, while toluene was reduced under a variety of bacteria-enriched environments, not just sulfate. The biodegradation of a creosote preservative in an anaerobic enrichment depends not only on the type of bacteria enriching the environment, but also the compound that has been released from the preservative. In aerobic environments, preservative compounds are limited in the biodegradation process by the presence of free oxygen. In an aerobic environment, free oxygen comes from oxygen saturated sediments, sources of precipitation, and plume edges. The free oxygen allows for the compounds to be oxidized and decomposed into new intermediate compounds. Studies have shown that when BTEX and PAH compounds were placed in aerobic environments, the oxidation of the ring structures caused cleavage in the aromatic ring and allowed for other functional groups to attach. When an aromatic hydrocarbon was introduced to the molecular oxygen in experimental conditions, a dihydrodiol intermediate was formed, and then oxidation occurred transforming the aromatic into a catechol compound. Catechol allows for cleavage of the aromatic ring to occur, where functional groups can then add in an ortho- or meta- position.

===Oxidation-reduction===
Even though many studies conduct testing under experimental or enriched conditions, oxidation-reduction reactions occur naturally and allow for chemicals to go through processes such as biodegradation, outlined above. Oxidation is defined as the loss of an electron to another species, while reduction is the gaining of an electron from another species. As compounds go through oxidation and reduction in sediments, the preservative compounds are altered to form new chemicals, leading to decomposition. An example of the oxidation of p-cresol and phenol can be seen in the figures below:

====p-Cresol====
This reaction shows the oxidation of p-cresol in a sulfate-enriched environment. P-cresol was seen to be the easiest to degrade through the sulfate-enriched environment, while m-cresol and o-cresol where inhibited. In the chart above, p-cresol was oxidized under an anaerobic sulfate reducing condition and formed four different intermediates. After the formation of the intermediates, the study reported further degradation of the intermediates leading to the production of carbon dioxide and methane. The p-hydroxylbenzyl alcohol, p-hydroxylbenzaldehye, p-hyrdoxylbenzoate, and benzoate intermediates all are produced from this oxidation and released into the sediments. Similar results were also produced by different studies using other forms of oxidation such as: iron-reducing organisms, Copper/Manganese Oxide catalyst, and nitrate- reducing conditions.

====Phenol====
This reaction shows the oxidation of phenol by iron and peroxide. This combination of iron, which comes from iron oxide in the sediment, and the peroxide, commonly released by animals and plants into the environment, is known as the Fenton Reagent. This reagent is used to oxidize phenol groups by the use of a radical hydroxide group produced from the peroxide in the p-benzoquinone. This product of phenol&#x27;s oxidation is now leached into the environment while other products include iron(II) and water. P-benzoquinone is listed as being a very toxic, acute environmental hazard.

==Environmental hazards==

===Sediment===
In aquatic sediments, several reactions can transform the chemicals released by the creosote preservatives into more dangerous chemicals. Most creosote preservative compounds have hazards associated with them before they are transformed. Cresol (m-, p-, and o-), phenol, guaiacol, and xylenol (1,3,4- and 1,3,5-) all are acute aquatic hazards prior to going through chemical reactions with the sediments. Alkylation reactions allows for the compounds to transition into more toxic compounds with the addition of R-groups to the major compounds found in creosote preservatives. Compounds formed through alkylation include: 3,4-dimethylphenol, 2,3-dimethylphenol, and 2,5-dimethylphenol, which are all listed as acute environmental hazards. Biodegradation controls the rate at which the sediment holds the chemicals, and the number of reactions that are able to take place. The biodegradation process can take place under many different conditions, and vary depending on the compounds that are released. Oxidation-reduction reactions allow for the compounds to be broken down into new forms of more toxic molecules. Studies have shown oxidation-reduction reactions of creosote preservative compounds included compounds that are listed as environmental hazards, such as p-benzoquinone in the oxidation of phenol. Not only are the initial compounds in creosote hazardous to the environment, but the byproducts of the chemical reactions are environmental hazardous as well.

===Other===
From the contamination of the sediment, more of the ecosystem is affected. Organisms in the sediment are now exposed to the new chemicals. Organisms are then ingested by fish and other aquatic animals. These animals now contain concentrations of hazardous chemicals which were secreted from the creosote. Other issues with ecosystems include bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation occurs when high levels of chemicals are passed to aquatic life near the creosote pilings. Mollusks and other smaller crustaceans are at higher risk because they are directly attached to the surface of wood pilings that are filled with creosote preservative. Studies show that mollusks in these environments take on high concentrations of chemical compounds which will then be transferred through the ecosystem&#x27;s food chain. Bioaccumulation contributes to the higher concentrations of chemicals within the organisms in the aquatic ecosystems.

<doc id="69058" wikidata="Q712280" url="?curid=69058" title="List of countries and dependencies by population">
<text>This is a list of countries and dependencies by population. It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country&#x27;s population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.119 billion as of 2024.

== Method ==

Figures used in this chart are based on the most up-to-date estimates or projections by the national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.

Where updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2024 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

Because the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of accuracy, the resulting numerical comparisons may create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.

Areas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union, and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries&#x27; claims to Antarctica.

== Sovereign states and dependencies by population ==

Note: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.

<doc id="69079" wikidata="Q190901" url="?curid=69079" title="Ammonium">
<text>Ammonium is a modified form of ammonia that has an extra hydrogen atom. It is a positively charged (cationic) molecular ion with the chemical formula or . It is formed by the addition of a proton (a hydrogen nucleus) to ammonia (). Ammonium is also a general name for positively charged (protonated) substituted amines and quaternary ammonium cations (), where one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by organic or other groups (indicated by R). Not only is ammonium a source of nitrogen and a key metabolite for many living organisms, but it is an integral part of the global nitrogen cycle. As such, human impact in recent years could have an effect on the biological communities that depend on it.

== Acid–base properties ==
The ammonium ion is generated when ammonia, a weak base, reacts with Brønsted acids (proton donors):
The ammonium ion is mildly acidic, reacting with Brønsted bases to return to the uncharged ammonia molecule:
Thus, the treatment of concentrated solutions of ammonium salts with a strong base gives ammonia. When ammonia is dissolved in water, a tiny amount of it converts to ammonium ions:

The degree to which ammonia forms the ammonium ion depends on the pH of the solution. If the pH is low, the equilibrium shifts to the right: more ammonia molecules are converted into ammonium ions. If the pH is high (the concentration of hydrogen ions is low and hydroxide ions is high), the equilibrium shifts to the left: the hydroxide ion abstracts a proton from the ammonium ion, generating ammonia.

Formation of ammonium compounds can also occur in the vapor phase; for example, when ammonia vapor comes in contact with hydrogen chloride vapor, a white cloud of ammonium chloride forms, which eventually settles out as a solid in a thin white layer on surfaces.

== Salts and characteristic reactions ==

Ammonium cation is found in a variety of salts such as ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride, and ammonium nitrate. Most simple ammonium salts are very soluble in water. An exception is ammonium hexachloroplatinate, the formation of which was once used as a test for ammonium. The ammonium salts of nitrate and especially perchlorate are highly explosive, in these cases, ammonium is the reducing agent.

In an unusual process, ammonium ions form an amalgam. Such species are prepared by the addition of sodium amalgam to a solution of ammonium chloride. This amalgam eventually decomposes to release ammonia and hydrogen.

To find whether the ammonium ion is present in the salt, first, the salt is heated in presence of alkali hydroxide releasing a gas with a characteristic smell, which is ammonia.

To further confirm ammonia, it is passed through a glass rod dipped in an solution (hydrochloric acid), creating white dense fumes of ammonium chloride.

Ammonia, when passed through (copper(II) sulfate) solution, changes its color from blue to deep blue, forming Schweizer&#x27;s reagent.

Ammonia or ammonium ion when added to Nessler&#x27;s reagent gives a brown color precipitate known as the iodide of Million&#x27;s base in basic medium.

Ammonium ion when added to chloroplatinic acid gives a yellow precipitate of ammonium hexachloroplatinate(IV).

Ammonium ion when added to sodium cobaltinitrite gives a yellow precipitate of ammonium cobaltinitrite.

Ammonium ion gives a white precipitate of ammonium bitartrate when added to potassium bitartrate.

== Structure and bonding ==

The lone electron pair on the nitrogen atom (N) in ammonia, represented as a line above the N, forms a coordinate bond with a proton (). After that, all four bonds are equivalent, being polar covalent bonds. The ion has a tetrahedral structure and is isoelectronic with methane and the borohydride anion. In terms of size, the ammonium cation (&quot;r&quot;ionic = 175 pm) resembles the caesium cation (&quot;r&quot;ionic = 183 pm).

== Organic ions ==

The hydrogen atoms in the ammonium ion can be substituted with an alkyl group or some other organic group to form a substituted ammonium ion (IUPAC nomenclature: aminium ion). Depending on the number of organic groups, the ammonium cation is called a primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary. Except the quaternary ammonium cations, the organic ammonium cations are weak acids.

An example of a reaction forming an ammonium ion is that between dimethylamine, , and an acid to give the dimethylammonium cation, :

Quaternary ammonium cations have four organic groups attached to the nitrogen atom, they lack a hydrogen atom bonded to the nitrogen atom. These cations, such as the tetra-&quot;n&quot;-butylammonium cation, are sometimes used to replace sodium or potassium ions to increase the solubility of the associated anion in organic solvents. Primary, secondary, and tertiary ammonium salts serve the same function but are less lipophilic. They are also used as phase-transfer catalysts and surfactants.

An unusual class of organic ammonium salts is derivatives of amine radical cations, such as tris(4-bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate.

== Biology ==
Because nitrogen often limits net primary production due to its use in enzymes that mediate the biochemical reactions that are necessary for life, ammonium is utilized by some microbes and plants. For example, energy is released by the oxidation of ammonium in a process known as nitrification, which produces nitrate and nitrite. This process is a form of autotrophy that is common amongst &quot;Nitrosomonas&quot;, &quot;Nitrobacter&quot;, &quot;Nitrosolobus&quot;, and &quot;Nitrosospira&quot;, amongst others.

The amount of ammonium in soil that is available for nitrification by microbes varies depending on environmental conditions. For example, ammonium is deposited as a waste product from some animals, although it is converted into urea in mammals, sharks, and amphibians, and into uric acid in birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails. Its availability in soils is also influenced by mineralization, which makes more ammonium available from organic nitrogen sources, and immobilization, which sequesters ammonium into organic nitrogen sources, both of which are mitigated by biological factors.

Conversely, nitrate and nitrite can be reduced to ammonium as a way for living organisms to access nitrogen for growth in a process known as assimilatory nitrate reduction. Once assimilated, it can be incorporated into proteins and DNA.

Ammonium can accumulate in soils where nitrification is slow or inhibited, which is common in hypoxic soils. For example, ammonium mobilization is one of the key factors for the symbiotic association between plants and fungi, called mycorrhizae. However, plants that consistently utilize ammonium as a nitrogen source often must invest into more extensive root systems due to ammonium&#x27;s limited mobility in soils compared to other nitrogen sources.

== Human impact ==
Ammonium deposition from the atmosphere has increased in recent years due to volatilization from livestock waste and increased fertilizer use. Because net primary production is often limited by nitrogen, increased ammonium levels could impact the biological communities that rely on it. For example, increasing nitrogen content has been shown to increase plant growth, but aggravate soil phosphorus levels, which can impact microbial communities.

== Metal ==
The ammonium cation has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metal cations and is often considered a close equivalent. Ammonium is expected to behave as a metal ( ions in a sea of electrons) at very high pressures, such as inside giant planets such as Uranus and Neptune.

Under normal conditions, ammonium does not exist as a pure metal but does as an amalgam (alloy with mercury).

<text>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP; , GRC) is the national police service of Canada. The RCMP is an agency of the Government of Canada; it also provides police services under contract to 11 provinces and territories, over 150 municipalities, and 600 Indigenous communities. The RCMP is commonly known as the Mounties in English (and colloquially in French as ).

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police was established in 1920 with the amalgamation of the Royal North-West Mounted Police and the Dominion Police. Sworn members of the RCMP have jurisdiction as a peace officer in all provinces and territories of Canada. Under its federal mandate, the RCMP is responsible for enforcing federal legislation; investigating inter-provincial and international crime; border integrity; overseeing Canadian peacekeeping missions involving police; managing the Canadian Firearms Program, which licenses and registers firearms and their owners; and the Canadian Police College, which provides police training to Canadian and international police services. Policing in Canada is considered to be a constitutional responsibility of provinces; however, the RCMP provides local police services under contract in all provinces and territories except Ontario and Quebec. Despite its name, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are no longer an actual mounted police service, and horses are used only at ceremonial events and certain other occasions.

The Government of Canada considers the RCMP to be an unofficial national symbol, and in 2013, 87 per cent of Canadians interviewed by Statistics Canada said that the RCMP was important to their national identity. However, the service has faced criticism for its broad mandate, and its public perception in Canada has gradually soured since the 1990s, worn down by workplace culture lawsuits, several high-profile scandals, staffing shortages, and the service&#x27;s handling of incidents like the 2020 Nova Scotia attacks. The treatment of First Nations people by the RCMP has also been criticized.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) compensates its officers based on a tiered pay scale that reflects their rank and years of service. Entry-level constables begin with a starting salary of $71,191 per year, with incremental raises leading to higher earnings as they gain experience:

* 6 months of service: $92,497 per year 
* 12 months of service: $100,356 per year 
* 24 months of service: $108,220 per year 
* 36 months of service: $115,350 per year

==History==
=== Early history (1920–1970) ===

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police was formed in 1920 by the amalgamation of two separate federal police services: the Royal North-West Mounted Police (RNWMP), which had been responsible for colonial policing in the Canadian West, but by 1920 was becoming &quot;rapidly obsolete;&quot; and the Dominion Police, which was responsible for federal law enforcement, intelligence, and parliamentary security. The new police service inherited the paramilitary, frontline policing-oriented culture that had governed the RNWMP, which had been modelled after the Royal Irish Constabulary, but much of the RCMP&#x27;s local policing role had been superseded by provincial and municipal police services.

In 1928, the federal government authorized the RCMP to enter into heavily subsidized contracts with provinces and municipalities, enabling the service to return to its roots in local policing. The federal government paid 60 per cent of the policing costs, while provinces and municipalities paid the remaining 40 per cent. By 1950, eight of the ten Canadian provinces had disbanded their provincial police services in favour of subsidized RCMP policing.

As part of its national security and intelligence functions, the RCMP infiltrated ethnic or political groups considered to be dangerous to Canada. These included the Communist Party of Canada (founded in 1921) and a variety of Indigenous, minority cultural, and nationalist groups. The service was also deeply involved in immigration matters, and was responsible for deporting suspected radicals. The RCMP paid particular attention to nationalist and socialist Ukrainian groups and the Chinese community, which was targeted because of disproportionate links to opium dens. Historians estimate that Canada deported two per cent of its Chinese community between 1923 and 1932, largely under the provisions of the &quot;Opium and Narcotics Drugs Act&quot;. The first Mountie to go undercover was Frank Zaneth who under the code name Operative Number 1 infiltrated various &quot;radical&quot; groups along with the Mafia.

In 1932, RCMP members killed Albert Johnson, the Mad Trapper of Rat River, after a shoot-out. Johnson had been the subject of a dispute with local Indigenous trappers—he had reportedly destroyed their traps, harassed them verbally, and on one occasion, pointed a firearm at them—and, when confronted with a search warrant, opened fire on RCMP officers, wounding one. Also in 1932, the Customs Preventive Service (CPS), a branch of the Department of National Revenue, was folded into the RCMP at the request of RCMP leadership.

In 1935, the RCMP, acting as the provincial police service for Saskatchewan (but against the wishes of the Saskatchewan government) and in collaboration with the Regina Police Service, attempted to arrest organizers of the On-to-Ottawa Trek in the Germantown neighbourhood&#x27;s market square by kettling around 300 rally-goers, sparking the Regina Riot. One city police officer and one protester were killed. The trek, which had been organized to call attention to conditions in relief camps, consequently failed to reach Ottawa, but nevertheless had political reverberations. That same year, three RCMP members, acting under contract as provincial police officers, were killed in Saskatchewan and Alberta during an arrest and subsequent pursuit.

During the interwar period, the RCMP employed special constables to assist with strikebreaking. For a brief period in the late 1930s, a volunteer militia group, the Legion of Frontiersmen, was affiliated with the RCMP. Many members of the RCMP belonged to this organization, which was prepared to serve as an auxiliary police service.

In 1940, the RCMP schooner &quot;St. Roch&quot; facilitated the first effective patrol of Canada&#x27;s Arctic territory. It was the first vessel to navigate the Northwest Passage from west to east, taking two years, the first to navigate the passage in one season (from Halifax to Vancouver in 1944), the first to sail either way through the passage in one season, and the first to circumnavigate North America (1950).

In 1941, two African-Canadian men from Nova Scotia applied to join the RCMP. The commissioner at the time, Stuart Wood, allegedly allowed them to sit for entrance tests in the hopes that they could be definitively refused entry to the service as &quot;their colour would raise the question of policy.&quot; Both men ultimately passed the requisite tests, but neither was given an offer of employment.

In the wake of the 1945 defection of Soviet cipher clerk Igor Gouzenko, who revealed that the Soviet Union was spying on Western nations, the RCMP separated its units responsible for domestic intelligence and counter-espionage from the Criminal Investigation Branch to the new Special Branch, formed in 1950. The branch changed names twice: in 1962, to the Directorate of Security and Intelligence; and in 1970 to the Security Service. On April 1, 1949, Newfoundland and Labrador joined in Confederation with Canada, and the Newfoundland Ranger Force amalgamated with the RCMP.

In June 1953, the RCMP became a full member of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). In 1969, the RCMP hired its first black police officer, Hartley Gosline.

=== Late 20th century ===
On July 4, 1973, during a visit to Regina, Saskatchewan, Queen Elizabeth II approved a new badge for the RCMP. The force subsequently presented the sovereign with a tapestry rendering of the new design.

In 1978, the RCMP formed 31 part-time emergency response teams across the country to respond to serious incidents requiring a tactical police response.

In 1986, in the wake of the 1985 Turkish embassy attack in Ottawa and the bombing of Air India Flight 182, the Canadian government directed the RCMP to form the Special Emergency Response Team (SERT), a full-time counter-terrorism unit.

In the early 1990s, journalists at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; opened an investigation into rumours that a senior RCMP officer in the Criminal Intelligence Service (CISC) was on the payroll of a Montreal-based organized crime group, and in 1992, aired an episode identifying Inspector Claude Savoie, then the assistant director of the CISC, as the leak, citing evidence that connected him to Allan Ronald Ross, an Irish-Canadian drug lord, and Sidney Leithman, a prominent lawyer associated with Montreal&#x27;s organized crime network. Shortly after the episode aired, and minutes before being interviewed by detectives with the RCMP&#x27;s professional standards unit, Savoie committed suicide in his Ottawa office. One of Savoie&#x27;s subordinates, Portuguese-Canadian constable Jorge Leite, was found guilty of corruption and breach of trust by a Portuguese court about his work with Savoie.

In 1993, the SERT was transferred to the Canadian Forces, creating a new unit called Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). The JTF2 inherited some equipment and the SERT&#x27;s former training base near Ottawa.

In 1995 the Personal Protection Group (PPG) of the RCMP was created at the behest of Jean Chrétien after the break-in by André Dallaire at the Prime Minister&#x27;s official Ottawa residence, 24 Sussex Drive. The PPG is a 180-member group responsible for VIP security details, chiefly the prime minister and the governor general.

In 1998, the RCMP, with the permission of the owners AEC, bombed an oil well shed as part of a &#x27;dirty tricks&#x27; campaign during a dispute between AEC and Wiebo Ludwig.

==== RCMP Security Service (1950–1984) ====

The RCMP Security Service (RCMPSS) was a specialized political intelligence and counterintelligence branch with national security responsibilities following revelations of illegal covert operations relating to the Quebec separatist movement. As a result, the RCMPSS was replaced by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) in 1984, and is statutorily independent of the RCMP.

In the late 1970s, revelations surfaced that the RCMP Security Service had in the course of their intelligence duties engaged in crimes such as burning a barn and stealing documents from the separatist Parti Québécois. This led to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP, better known as the &quot;McDonald Commission&quot;, named for the presiding judge, Justice David Cargill McDonald. The commission recommended that the service&#x27;s intelligence duties be removed in favour of the creation of a separate intelligence agency, the CSIS. The RCMP and the CSIS nonetheless continue to share responsibility for some law enforcement activities in the contemporary era, particularly in the anti-terrorism context.

===21st century===

Due to 9/11, the RCMP Sky Marshals, which is charged with security on passenger aircraft, was inaugurated in 2002.

Four RCMP officers were fatally shot during the Mayerthorpe tragedy in Northern Alberta in March 2005. It was the single largest multiple killing of RCMP officers since the killing of three officers in Kamloops, British Columbia, by a mentally ill assailant in June 1962. Before that, the RCMP had not incurred such a loss since the North-West Rebellion. One result was that on 21 October 2011 Commissioner William J. S. Elliott announced that RCMP officers would have the C8 rifle at their disposal, where in the past they had been limited to sidearms. One of the main conclusions from the fatality inquiry that led to this result was the fact that the officers who were involved in the events did not have the appropriate weapons to face someone with a semi-automatic rifle.

In 2006, the United States Coast Guard&#x27;s Ninth District and the RCMP began a program called &quot;Shiprider&quot;, in which 12 Mounties from the RCMP detachment at Windsor and 16 U.S. Coast Guard boarding officers from stations in Michigan ride in each other&#x27;s vessels. The intent was to allow for seamless enforcement of the international border.

On December 6, 2006, RCMP Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli resigned after admitting that his earlier testimony about the Maher Arar case was inaccurate. The RCMP&#x27;s actions were scrutinized by the Commission of Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Officials in Relation to Maher Arar. In the aftermath of the Arar affair, the commission of inquiry recommended that the RCMP be subject to greater oversight from a review board with investigative and information-sharing capacities. Following the commission of inquiry&#x27;s recommendations, the Harper government tabled amendments to the RCMP Act to create the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission.

In the wake of the 2007 Robert Dziekański taser incident at the Vancouver International Airport, two officers were found guilty of perjury to the Braidwood Inquiry and sentenced to jail for their actions. They appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada but were unsuccessful.

In July 2007, two RCMP officers were shot and succumbed to their injuries in the Spiritwood Incident near Mildred, Saskatchewan.

By the end of 2007, the RCMP was named Newsmaker of the Year by The Canadian Press.

====2010s====
The RCMP mounted the Queen&#x27;s Life Guard in May 2012 during celebrations of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee.

On June 3, 2013, the RCMP&#x27;s A Division was renamed the &quot;National Division&quot; and tasked with handling corruption cases &quot;at home and abroad&quot;.

In June 2014, three RCMP officers were murdered during the Moncton shooting. A review from retired assistant commissioner Alphonse MacNeil in May 2015 issued 64 recommendations, while the RCMP was charged with violating the Canada Labour Code (CLC) for the slow roll-out of the C8 carbine, which had been recommended by the 2011 Elliott inquiry. The RCMP issued the first carbines in 2013, and with 12,000 members across the country had, as of May 2015, only purchased 2,200. At the CLC trial the Crown argued that the then newly-retired head of the RCMP Bob Paulson had &quot;played the odds&quot; with officer safety and it proved fatal. One result of the CLC trial was the conviction of the organization that had been led by Paulson for close to seven years.

In October 2016, the RCMP issued an apology for harassment, discrimination, and sexual abuse of female officers and civilian members. Additionally, they set aside a $100 million fund to compensate these victims. Over 20,000 current and past female employees who were employed after 1974 are eligible.

In January 2019 of that year, the RCMP enforced an injunction against the Wet’suwet’en first nation, raiding the Unist’ot’en Camp and arresting 14 people. This sparked widespread protests and solidarity actions across Canada after reports surfaced of the use of violence by the RCMP. 

====2020s====
In February 2020, The RCMP again enforced the injunction, leading to further arrests and escalating tensions. Rail blockades and other disruptions occurred across the country in support of the Wet’suwet’en. There was widespread condemnation across Canada of the surveillance tactics employed by the RCMP. During one protest, two journalists were arrested by the RCMP during the protests, prompting an investigation by the federal government. The RCMP was further criticized when video footage of officers breaking into the homes of Wet&#x27;suwet&#x27;en community members and pointing weapons at peaceful protesters surfaced on youtube. In audio recordings played in the B.C. supreme court, RCMP officers referred to First Nations opposed to gas pipelines as &quot;orcs&quot; and &quot;ogres&quot;.

On March 10, 2020, Chief Allan Adam of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation was arrested by two RCMP officers in Fort McMurray, Alberta. After several minutes of Chief Adam yelling and posturing at officers, the officers tackled him and punched him in the head whilst struggling with him on the ground. Chief Adam was later charged with resisting arrest and assaulting a peace officer, but the charges were subsequently dropped. After watching the video of the arrest, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, &quot;[w]e have all now seen the shocking video of Chief Adam&#x27;s arrest and we must get to the bottom of this&quot;. Following the revelation of Chief Adam&#x27;s arrest—as well as several other recent instances in which RCMP officers had assaulted or killed Indigenous people—RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki stated, after initially demurring on the question, that systemic racism exists in the RCMP: &quot;I do know that systemic racism is part of every institution, the RCMP included&quot;, she said. One day earlier, Trudeau had also stated that &quot;[s]ystemic racism is an issue right across the country, in all our institutions, including in all our police services, including in the RCMP.&quot;

RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson was killed while responding to the Wortman killing spree that left 23 dead in Nova Scotia in April 2020. The political furor that followed engulfed Commissioner Brenda Lucki and her minister, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair. The RCMP was strongly criticized for its response to the attacks, the deadliest rampage in Canadian history, as well as their lack of transparency in the criminal investigation. CBC News&#x27; television program &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; and online newspaper &quot;Halifax Examiner&quot; analyzed the timeline of events, and both observed a myriad of failures and shortcomings in the RCMP response. A criminologist criticized the RCMP&#x27;s response as &quot;a mess&quot; and called for an overhaul in how the agency responds to active shooter situations, after they had failed to properly respond to other such incidents in the past.

In the early 2020s, several governments, politicians, and scholars recommended terminating the RCMP&#x27;s contract policing program. Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino was mandated to conduct a review of RCMP contract policing when he took office in 2022.

In June 2021, Privacy Commissioner of Canada Daniel Therrien found that the RCMP had broken Canadian privacy law through hundreds of illegal searches using Clearview AI.

In February 2022, four men were arrested near Coutts, Alberta, for their roles in an alleged conspiracy to kill RCMP officers during the Canada convoy protest.

On September 19, 2022, the RCMP led the procession through London, England, following the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II due to the long-standing special relationship with the Queen.

In 2023, the Mass Casualty Commission recommended that the RCMP replace its Depot-based training regime with a more intensive university-style program and that the federal public safety minister review the RCMP&#x27;s involvement in contract policing. Later that year, the force established a new direct-entry program for federal policing candidates. Those recruited for the program will be required to complete a shorter, more focussed 14-week training curriculum in Ottawa before being posted to a federal policing position. As of 2024, the implementation is suspended due to concerns raised by unions.

In the early 2020s, the cities of Surrey, British Columbia, and Grande Prairie, Alberta, both established independent municipal police forces to replace the RCMP. In the wake of these decisions, and similar moves by the governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan to establish supplementary provincial police services to support (and, according to some critics, eventually replace) the RCMP, Commissioner Mike Duheme indicated that the RCMP was learning how to better manage transitions to local policing from contract policing. Similar transitions have been proposed, debated, or approved in some Alberta First Nations, rural Manitoba, and rural New Brunswick.

===Role in the colonization of Canada===

As the federal police service of the Government of Canada, the RCMP has had an expansive and controversial role in the colonization of Canada. One of the RCMP&#x27;s two preceding agencies—the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP)—had enjoyed a relatively positive relationship with the Indigenous peoples of Canada, buoyed by their role in restoring order to the Canadian West, which had been disrupted by immigrant settlement, and the stark contrast between Canadian policy and the ongoing American Indian Wars in the late 19th century. After the signing of the Numbered Treaties between 1871 and 1899, however, the service generally failed to provide Indigenous communities with police services equal to those provided to non-Indigenous communities.

American historian Andrew Graybill argued the RCMP historically resembled the Texas Rangers in many ways: each protected the established order by confining and removing Indigenous peoples; tightly controlling the mixed-blood peoples (the African Americans in Texas and the Métis in Canada); assisting the large-scale ranchers against the small-scale ranchers and farmers who fenced the land; and breaking the power of labor unions that tried to organize the workers of industrial corporations.
From 1920 (1933, with respect to the &quot;Indian Act&quot;) to 1996, RCMP officers served as truant officers for Indian residential schools, including through the transition of students from federal residential to provincial day schools after 1948, assisting principals, staff, Indian agents, relatives, and members of the communities in bringing truant children to the schools, sometimes by force, as per the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, and as was common for truant non-Indigenous children through the same period. Marcel-Eugène LeBeuf stated in his report for the RCMP that records and oral histories indicate the force &quot;was responding, in its most traditional police role, to a request to protect children&quot; and that abuses within the residential school system were largely unreported to the RCMP at the time.

During the federal government&#x27;s imposition of municipal-style elected councils on First Nations people, the RCMP raided the government buildings of particularly resistant traditional hereditary chiefs&#x27; councils and oversaw the subsequent council elections—the Six Nations of the Grand River Elected Council was originally referred to as the &quot;Mounties Council&quot; as a result of the RCMP&#x27;s involvement in its installation.

====Role in land disputes====

In 1995, the RCMP intervened in the Gustafsen Lake standoff between the armed Ts&#x27;peten Defenders, occupying what they claimed was unceded Indigenous land, and armed ranchers, who owned the land and had previously allowed Indigenous people to use part of it on the condition they not erect permanent structures. The RCMP&#x27;s response included 400 tactical assault team members, five helicopters, two surveillance planes, and nine Bison armoured personnel carriers on loan from the Canadian Army and sparked international controversy over the RCMP&#x27;s use of unusually broad press exclusion zones. One of the members of the Ts&#x27;peten Defenders was later granted political asylum in the United States after an Oregon judge found that the RCMP&#x27;s reporting of the incident—marked by an RCMP member&#x27;s off-hand comment to media that &quot;smear campaigns are [the RCMP&#x27;s] specialty&quot;—amounted to a &quot;disinformation campaign.&quot;
Between January 2019 and March 2020, the RCMP spent $13 million policing and periodically enforcing injunctions against Indigenous protesters blocking the construction of a pipeline across what the protesters asserted was unceded Wet&#x27;suwet&#x27;en territory. Wet&#x27;suwet&#x27;en hereditary chiefs Na&#x27;moks and Woos complained about the armed RCMP presence, as the police moved down the road, kilometre-by-kilometre, over days, dismantling fortified checkpoints and making arrests. The RCMP&#x27;s enforcement of a court injunction against the occupiers in 2020 sparked international controversy and protests and, as of 2022, sporadic occupations and protests—some violent—have continued at the site.

===Women in the RCMP===

In the 1920s, Saskatchewan provincial pathologist Frances Gertrude McGill began providing forensic assistance to the RCMP in their investigations. She helped establish the first RCMP forensic laboratory in 1937, and later was its director for several years. In addition to her forensic work, McGill also provided training to new RCMP and police recruits in forensic detection methods. Upon her retirement in 1946, McGill was appointed honorary surgeon to the RCMP and continued to act as a dedicated consultant for the service up until her death in 1959.

On May 23, 1974, RCMP Commissioner Maurice Nadon announced that the RCMP would accept applications from women as regular members of the service. Troop 17 was the first group of 32 women at Depot in Regina on September 16, 1974, for regular training. This first all-female troop of 30 women graduated from Depot on March 3, 1975.

After initially wearing different uniforms, female officers were finally issued the standard RCMP uniforms. Now all officers are identically attired, with two exceptions. The ceremonial dress uniform, or &quot;walking-out order&quot;, for female members has a long, blue skirt and higher-heeled slip-on pumps plus a small black clutch purse (however, in 2012 the RCMP began to allow women to wear trousers and boots with all their formal uniforms).) The second exception is the official maternity uniform for pregnant female officers assigned to administrative duties.

The following years saw the first women attain certain positions. 

* 1981: corporal, musical ride
* 1987: foreign post
* 1990: detachment commander
* 1992: commissioned officer
* 1998: assistant commissioner
* 2000: deputy commissioner
* 2006: interim commissioner
* 2018: permanent commissioner
==Organization==
===National===
The RCMP is organized under the authority of the &quot;Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act&quot; (&quot;RCMP Act&quot;), an act of the Parliament of Canada. Under sections 3 and 4 of the &quot;RCMP Act&quot;, the RCMP is a police service for Canada; namely, a federal police service. However, section 20 of the &quot;RCMP Act&quot; provides that the RCMP may be used for law enforcement in provinces or municipalities if certain conditions are met. As explained by Justice Ivan Rand of the Supreme Court of Canada, &quot;what is set up is a police service for the whole of Canada to be used in the enforcement of the laws of the Dominion, but at the same time available for the enforcement of law generally in such provinces as may desire to employ its services.&quot;

Under section 5 of the &quot;RCMP Act&quot;, the agency is headed by the commissioner of the RCMP, who, under the direction of the minister of public safety and emergency preparedness, has the control and management of the service and all matters connected therewith. The RCMP is provided with a senior executive committee (SEC) which The commissioner is assisted by deputy commissioners in charge of Contract and Indigenous Policing, Federal Policing, and Specialized Policing Services. The commanding officers of K Division and E Division are also named deputy commissioners.

====Divisions====
The RCMP divides the country into divisions for command purposes. In general, each division is coterminous with a province (for example, C Division in Quebec). The province of Ontario, however, is divided into two divisions: National Division (National Capital Region) and O Division (rest of the province). There is one additional division, Depot Division, which comprises the RCMP Academy in Regina and the Police Dog Service Training Centre in Innisfail. The RCMP National Headquarters are in Ottawa, Ontario, established in 1920.

Some historical divisions are no longer in use.
=====Detachments=====
A detachment is a section of the RCMP that polices a local area. Detachments vary greatly in size.

The largest RCMP detachment is in Burnaby, British Columbia. Previously, Surrey, British Columbia, once had the largest detachment with over a thousand employees. However, amid criticism over gang violence and growing debate during the 2018 civic election, the municipal Surrey Police Service eventually assumed jurisdiction, ending Surrey&#x27;s RCMP policing contract that had been in place since 1951.

Conversely, detachments in small, isolated rural communities have as few as three officers. The RCMP formerly had many single-officer detachments in these areas, but in 2012 the RCMP announced that it was introducing a requirement that detachments should have at least three officers.

As of 2022, several large Indigenous communities do not have RCMP detachments and are instead served by detachments in much smaller non-Indigenous communities.

===Personal Protection Group===

The Personal Protection Group (PPG) is a 180-member group responsible for security details for the monarch, other members of the royal family, and other VIPs. It was created after the 1995 break-in at 24 Sussex Drive. There are three units within the PPG: The Governor General&#x27;s Protection Detail and the Prime Minister&#x27;s Protection Detail provide bodyguards for the safety of the governor general of Canada and the prime minister of Canada, respectively, in Canada and abroad. These units are based in Ottawa, the former with operations at Rideau Hall (the monarch&#x27;s and governor general&#x27;s official residence in the capital) and the latter at 24 Sussex Drive (the prime minister&#x27;s official residence) and Harrington Lake (the prime minister&#x27;s retreat), near Chelsea, Quebec. The Very Important Persons Security Section provides security details to VIPs (including the chief justice of Canada, federal ministers other than the prime minister, and diplomats) and others under the direction of the minister of public safety.

===International===
The RCMP International Operations Branch (IOB) assists the Liaison Officer (LO) Program to deter international crime relating to Canadian criminal laws. The IOB is a section of the International Policing, which is part of the RCMP Federal and International Operations Directorate. Thirty-seven liaison officers are placed in 23 other countries and are responsible for organizing Canadian investigations in other countries, developing and maintaining the exchange of criminal intelligence, especially national security with other countries, to assist in investigations that directly affect Canada, to coordinate and assist RCMP officers on foreign business and to represent the RCMP at international meetings.

Liaison officers are in:

*Africa &amp; Middle East:
** Rabat, Morocco
** Pretoria, South Africa
** Amman, Jordan
** Dubai, U.A.E. 
*Asia-Pacific:
** New Delhi, India
** Islamabad, Pakistan
** Bangkok, Thailand
** Hong Kong SAR
** Beijing, China
** Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
** Colombo, Sri Lanka
* Europe:
** London, United Kingdom
** Mons, Belgium (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe)
** Paris, France
** Berlin, Germany
** The Hague, Netherlands
** Gdynia, Poland
** Rome, Italy 
*The Americas:
** Kingston, Jamaica
** Mexico City, Mexico
** Bogotá, Colombia
** Caracas, Venezuela
** Brasília, Brazil
** Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic
** Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago
** United States:
*** Miami, Florida
*** New York, New York
*** Seattle, Washington
*** Washington, D.C.
The RCMP also provides law enforcement training overseas in Iraq and other Canadian peacekeeping missions. The RCMP has been involved in training and logistically supporting the Haitian National Police since 1994, a controversial matter in Canada considering allegations of widespread human rights violations on the part of the HNP. Some Canadian activist groups have called for an end to the RCMP training.

==Personnel==
, the RCMP employed 30,196 men and women, including police officers, civilian members, and public service employees.

Actual personnel strength by ranks:

* Commissioners: 1
* Deputy commissioners: 6
* Assistant commissioners: 28
* Chief superintendents: 57
* Superintendents: 187
* Inspectors: 322
* Corps sergeants major: 1
* Sergeants major: 8
* Staff sergeants major: 9
* Staff sergeants: 838
* Sergeants: 2,018
* Corporals: 3,599
* Constables: 11,913
* Special constables: 122
* Civilian members: 7,695
* Public servants: 3,403
* Total: 30,196

===Regular members===

The term &quot;regular member&quot;, or RM, originates from the &quot;RCMP Act&quot; and refers to the 18,988 regular RCMP officers who are trained and sworn as peace officers, and include all the ranks from constable to commissioner. They are the police officers of the RCMP and are responsible for investigating crime and have the authority to make arrests. RMs operate in over 750 detachments, including 200 municipalities and more than 600 Indigenous communities. RMs are normally assigned to general policing duties at an RCMP detachment for a minimum of three years. These duties allow them to experience a broad range of assignments and experiences, such as responding to emergency (9-1-1) calls, foot patrol, bicycle patrol, traffic enforcement, collecting evidence at crime scenes, testifying in court, apprehending criminals and plain clothes duties. Regular members also serve in over 150 different types of operational and administrative opportunities available within the RCMP, these include major crime investigations, emergency response, forensic identification, forensic collision reconstruction, international peacekeeping, bike or marine patrol, explosives disposal, and police dog services. Also included are administrative roles including human resources, corporate planning, policy analysis, and public affairs.

===Auxiliary constables and other staff members===
Besides the regular RCMP officers, several types of designations exist which give them assorted powers and responsibilities over policing issues.

Presently, there are:
* Community constables: Varies across Canada 
* Reserve constables : Varies across Canada
* Auxiliary constables: Varies across Canada
* Special constables: 122
* Civilian criminal investigators: 35 
* Civilian members: 7,590
* Public servants: 3,497

====Community constables (CC)====
A designation introduced in 2014 as a replacement for the community safety officers and Indigenous community constables pilot programs. Community constables are armed, paid members holding the rank of special constables, with peace officer power. They are to provide a bridge between the local citizens and the RCMP using their local and cultural knowledge. They are mostly focused on crime prevention, liaisons with the community, and providing resources in the event of a large-scale event.

====Reserve constables (R/Cst.)====
A program reinstated in 2004 in British Columbia, it was later expanded to cover all of Canada to allow for retired, regular RCMP members and other provincially trained officers to provide extra manpower when shortages are identified. R/Cst. are appointed under Section 11 of the &quot;Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act&quot; as paid part-time, armed officers with the same powers as regular members. However, they are not allowed to carry service-issued sidearms and use of force options unless they are called upon to duty. They generally carry out community policing roles but may also be called upon if an emergency occurs.
====Auxiliary constables (A/Cst.)====
Volunteers within their community, appointed under provincial police acts. Auxiliary constables are not police officers and can not identify themselves as such. However, they are given peace officer powers when on duty with a regular member (RM). Their duties consist mainly of assisting RMs in routine events, for example, cordoning off crime scene areas, crowd control, participating in community policing, and assistance during situations where regular members might be overwhelmed with their duties (e.g., keeping watch of a backseat detainee while an RM interviews a victim). They are identified by the wording &quot;RCMP Auxiliary&quot; on cars, jackets, and shoulder flashes.

====Special constables (S/Cst.)====
Employees of the RCMP have varied duties depending on where they are deployed but are often given this designation because of the expertise they possess that needs to be applied in a certain area. For example, an Indigenous person might be appointed a special constable to assist regular members as they police an Indigenous community where English is not well understood, and where the special constable speaks the language well.

They still perform this role today in many isolated northern communities and the RCMP has 122 special constables who are active, and they are drawn almost entirely from the same Indigenous communities that they serve. From the early years of policing in northern Canada, and well into the 1950s, local Indigenous people were hired by the RCMP as special constables and were employed as guides to obtain and care for sled dog teams. Many of these former special constables still reside in the north to this day and are still involved in the regimental functions of the RCMP. Most pilots for RCMP aircraft, such as fixed-wing planes or helicopters, are special constables.

====Civilian criminal investigators (CCI)====
CCIs were implemented in 2021. They are civilian unarmed staff members, with limited peace officer status and are restricted from making physical arrests. CCIs have backgrounds in computer science or financial markets and are involved in specialized investigations. They participate in interviews, the preparation of court documents, and the searching of scenes.

==== Civilian members of the RCMP====
While not delegated the powers of police officers, they are instead hired for their specialized scientific, technological, communications, and administrative skills. Since the RCMP is a multi-faceted law enforcement organization with responsibilities for federal, provincial, and municipal policing duties, it offers employment opportunities for civilian members as professional partners within Canada&#x27;s national police service. Civilian members represent approximately 14 percent of the total RCMP employee population and are employed within RCMP establishments in most geographical areas of Canada. The following is a list of the most common categories of employment that may be available to interested and qualified individuals.

* Administrative
** Human resource management
** Police Records Information Management Environment (PRIME-BC)
** Policy development and analysis
** Staff development and training
** Translation
*Operations
** Telecommunications operator (dispatcher)
* Scientific (forensic laboratory services)
** Biology services
** Firearms and toolmark identification (covering Forensic firearm examination, ballistics, and related examinations)
** National Anti-counterfeiting Bureau
** Toxicology services
** Trace evidence
*Technical
** Communications
** Computer systems development
** Counterfeit analysis
** Document examination
** Electronics Technology
** Firearms technology
** Forensic identification services
** Information services and public affairs
** Information technology
** Instrument technology
** Telecommunications

====Public service employees====
Also referred to as public servants, PSes, or PSEs, they provide much of the administrative support for the RCMP in the form of detachment clerks and other administrative support at the headquarters level. They are not police officers, do not wear a uniform, have no police authority, and are not bound by the &quot;RCMP Act&quot;.
====Municipal employees====
Abbreviated as &quot;ME&quot; they are found in RCMP detachments where a contract exists with a municipality to provide front-line policing. MEs are not employees of the RCMP but are instead employed by the local municipality to work in the RCMP detachment. They conduct the same duties that a PSE would and are required to meet the same reliability and security clearance to do so. Many detachment buildings house a combination of municipally and provincially funded detachments, and therefore there are often PSEs and MEs found working together in them.

===Ranks===

The rank system of the RCMP is partly a result of their origin as a paramilitary service. Upon its founding, the RCMP adopted the rank insignia of the Canadian Militia (which in turn came from the British Army). As in the military, the RCMP also has a distinction between commissioned and non-commissioned officers. The non-commissioned ranks are mostly based on military ranks (apart from constable). Non-commissioned officer ranks above staff sergeant resemble those that formerly existed in the Canadian Army, but have since been replaced by warrant officers. The commissioned officer ranks, by contrast, use a set of non-military titles that are often used in Commonwealth police services. The number of higher ranks like chief superintendent and deputy commissioner have been added on and increased since the formation of the service, while the lower commissioned rank of sub-inspector has been dropped.

The numbers are current as of April 1, 2019:

These are the official abbreviations for the commissioned and non-commissioned officers in the RCMP.
The inspector ranks and higher ranks are commissioned ranks and are appointed by the Governor-in-Council. Depending on the badges and dresses which are worn on the shoulder as slip-ons, on shoulder boards, or directly on the epaulettes. The lower ranks are non-commissioned officers, and the insignia continues to be based on pre-1968 Canadian Army patterns. Since 1990, the non-commissioned officers&#x27; insignias &amp; insignias have been embroidered on the epaulette slip-ons. Non-commissioned rank badges are worn on the right sleeve of the scarlet/blue tunic and blue jacket. Constables wear no rank insignia. There are also 122 special constables, as well as a varying number of reserve constables, auxiliary constables, and students who wear identifying insignia.

The star, or &quot;pip&quot;, used in the insignia of commissioned officers represents the military Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. The order&#x27;s motto (, &#x27;three joined in one&#x27;, referring to the holy trinity) is inscribed in a band in the middle of it. The three crowns inset in the centre not only represent the Christian Trinity but also the three former kingdoms that became the United Kingdom. The RCMP formerly had subaltern (junior officer) ranks that were indicated by one &quot;pip&quot; for a sub-inspector (equivalent to an army second lieutenant) to three &quot;pips&quot; for an inspector (equivalent to an army captain). A reorganization in 1960 changed the insignia to three &quot;pips&quot; for sub-inspectors and a crown for inspectors, making the latter a field officer rank. The rank of sub-inspector was abolished in 1990, leaving the RCMP with no subaltern ranks.

A royal crown is used in the regimental cap badge and the insignia of senior commissioned officers. In 1955 St. Edward&#x27;s Crown replaced the Tudor Crown. Although Queen Elizabeth II adopted the redesign of the heraldic crown in 1953, it took some time to design, approve, and manufacture the new insignia. 

The crossed Mameluke sabre and baton is the insignia for general officers. In the RCMP it designates the commissioner (equivalent to an army general) and their subordinate deputy commissioners (equivalent to army lieutenant-generals). The assistant commissioners use the crown-over-three-pips insignia of an army brigadier. 

The brass shoulder title pin on the epaulettes was changed from &quot;RCMP&quot; to &quot;GRC-RCMP&quot; in 1968. ( stands for , the RCMP&#x27;s French-language title). This was due to a 1968 ruling stating that all statutes had to be published bilingually in both English and French. As a law enforcement agency, the RCMP had to use ranks and titles in both languages. This was later reinforced by the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; (1969) .

=== Honorary positions and the role of the Royal Family. ===
Several members of the Canadian royal family hold honorary titles in the RCMP. These roles are comparable to the colonel-in-chief and honorary colonel positions in the Canadian Army, serving as promoters of the service&#x27;s identity, traditions, and history, as well as making occasional visits to operational units. The commissioner-in-chief of the RCMP receives information and updates on important activities and serve as an advisor to the force&#x27;s commanding officer; although, they do not play an operational role with the service. 

In addition to members of the Canadian Royal Family holding these positions, as federal law enforcement officers all members of the RCMP swear allegiance to the Monarch of Canada, presently King Charles III.

==== Commissioner in chief ====

The commissioner-in-chief is the most senior honorary and ceremonial leadership position in the RCMP; it is held by Charles III, King of Canada, who was bestowed the role prior to his coronation in 2023.

The role was established as a separate role for the Canadian monarch from that of honorary commissioner in 2012. The first holder was Queen Elizabeth II, who was bestowed the title in celebration of her diamond jubilee. The role was created to show and maintain the close link between the Canadian monarch and the RCMP. The role has no day-to-day operational function, but the commissioner-in-chief receives regular updates on the important activities of the RCMP, as well as promoting the Mounted Police both in Canada and abroad, and visiting RCMP events. Upon appointment the commissioner-in-chief is presented with a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer&#x27;s sword, bearing the Canadian coat of arms and the royal cypher.

Before the creation of commissioner in chief, the role of honorary commissioner was usually held by periodically by the Canadian monarchs and heirs apparent. Since 2023 the role of honorary commissioner has not been in use.

==== Honorary deputy commissioner ====
Honorary deputy commissioners are honorary positions held by senior members of the Canadian Royal Family, whose role is also to show the connection of the Royal Family and the RCMP.

The current honorary deputy commissioners are Anne, Princess Royal, and Edward, Duke of Edinburgh.

===== Presently unused roles =====

Honorary commissioner was a role in the RCMP which had been held by Canadian monarchs and heirs apparent. Since Charles III&#x27;s appointment as commissioner-in-chief in April 2023 the role of honorary commissioner has not been in use.
==Equipment and vehicles==
===Land fleet===
The RCMP Land Transport Fleet inventory includes:
* Cars: 5,330
* Unmarked vehicles: 2,811
* Light trucks: 2,090
* Heavy trucks: 123 
* SUVs: 616 
* Motorcycles: 34
* Small snowmobiles: 481
* All-terrain vehicles: 181
* Tractors: 27
* Buses: 3
* Armoured Personnel Carriers: 2
* Total: 11,699
===Marine craft===

The RCMP policies Canadian Internal Waters, including the territorial sea and contiguous zone as well as the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway; such operations are provided by the RCMP&#x27;s Federal Services Directorate and include enforcing Canada&#x27;s environment, fisheries, customs, and immigration laws. In provinces and municipalities where the RCMP performs contract policing, the service polices freshwater lakes and rivers.

To meet these challenges, the RCMP operates the Marine Division, with five Robert Allan Ltd.–designed high-speed catamaran patrol vessels; &quot;Inkster&quot; and the &quot;Commissioner&quot;-class &quot;Nadon&quot;, &quot;Higgitt&quot;, &quot;Lindsay&quot; and &quot;Simmonds&quot;, based on all three coasts and manned by officers specially trained in maritime enforcement. &quot;Inkster&quot; is based in Prince Rupert, BC, &quot;Simmonds&quot; is stationed on Newfoundland&#x27;s south coast, and the rest are on the Pacific Coast. &quot;Simmonds&quot;&#x27; livery is unique, in that it sports the RCMP badge, but is otherwise painted with Canadian Coast Guard colours and the marking &quot;Coast Guard Police&quot;. The other four vessels are painted with blue and white RCMP colours.

The RCMP operates 377 smaller boats, defined as vessels less than long, at locations across Canada. This category ranges from canoes and car toppers to rigid-hulled inflatables and stable, commercially built, inboard-outboard vessels. Individual detachments often have smaller high-speed rigid-hulled inflatable boats and other purpose-built vessels for inland waters, some of which can be hauled by road to the nearest launching point.

===Aircraft fleet===
As of February 2023, the RCMP had 35 police aircraft (9 helicopters and 26 fixed-wing aircraft) registered with Transport Canada and operate as ICAO airline designator SST, and telephony STETSON. All aircraft are operated and maintained by the Air Services Branch.
===Weapons and intervention options===

* Smith &amp; Wesson Model 5946 (1992–present) – Standard full-sized service sidearm. It is stainless-steel, double-action only, with a barrel and a double-column 15-round magazine. 
** Emergency response team (ERT) and dog handler members were issued modified Model 5946s with magazine safeties removed until they were replaced with the SIG Sauer P226R.
* Smith &amp; Wesson Model 3953 (1996–present) – Special issue compact sidearm for plainclothes members and commissioned officers. It can also be requested as a service pistol by members with small hands who cannot positively grip the larger Model 5946. It is similar to the Model 5946 except it has a shorter barrel, a shortened grip, and a single-column eight-round magazine.
* SIG Sauer 226R (9×19mm) – Standard issue sidearm for ERT and dog-handler members. It replaced the modified Model 5946 that had been previously issued.
* Glock Model 19 – Special issue sidearm for Canadian Air Carrier Protective Program (CACPP) members.
* Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 – Adopted by the ERT
* Remington Model 700 (.308 Winchester) bolt-action rifle

* Colt Canada C7 rifle (5.56mm NATO)
* Colt Canada C8 carbine (5.56mm NATO) – Adopted by ERT 
** Colt Canada C8 IUR (integrated upper receiver) 5.56mm NATO. The semi-automatic C8 IUR was adopted for general use in October 2011, but the first batch were not procured until 2013. The first RCMP Cadets began qualifying on the C8 IUR and receiving Active Shooter training in 2015.
* Taser International M26, X26, and X26P. Following the Robert Dziekański incident, all older M26 models and 60 faulty X26 models in stock were removed and destroyed in 2010 due to being outside of specifications.
* Oleoresin capsicum spray
* ASP and Monadnock expandable defensive batons

====Past weapons and intervention options====

;Rifles
* Canadian Arsenals Limited (CAL) C1A1 – issued in 7.62mm NATO. Canadian variant of the FN FAL and L1A1 produced under licence by Canadian Arsenals Limited (CAL) (Long Branch). The RCMP&#x27;s rifles were sourced from the testing batch of FALs received from Fabrique Nationale and had been rebuilt by CAL to meet C1A1 standards. Used from 1961 to 1969. 
* Winchester Model 70 Issued in .308 Winchester. Used from 1960–1973. This rifle was replaced by the Remington 700.
* Lee–Enfield No. 4 Mk 1 – issued in .303 British. World War II surplus rifles were used from 1947 to 1966. Replaced by CAL C1A1 and Winchester 70.
* Short Magazine Lee Enfield (SMLE) No. 1 Mk III – issued in .303 British. World War I surplus rifles used from 1919–1947.
* Lee-Enfield carbine (LEC) – issued in .303 British. Procured as military surplus from militia stores to replace the unsatisfactory Ross Rifle. Used from 1914 to 1920. This was the last general-issue rifle used by the NWMP. The RCMP that replaced it only issued rifles according to need.
* Ross rifle – issued in .303 British. The Ross Mk I was issued from 1905 to 1907 and the improved Ross Mk II was in testing from 1909 to 1912. The Mk I design was accepted by the Canadian Militia in 1903. The NWMP looked at acquiring the Ross to replace the Winchester and Lee-Metford and ordered 1000. Production problems led to delays until 1904; the most glaring being that the finished product did not match their original specifications. The NWMP demanded their contract carbines use a different set of iron sights (which later became standard on the Mk II) which delayed production for a further year. The carbines received in 1905 were plagued with quality control problems that made them more fragile than the weapons they were to replace. After a constable suffered an eye injury in 1907 the Ross carbines were withdrawn. When the improved Ross Mk II rifles arrived in 1909 the wary NWMP decided to test-fire all of them fully before issuing them. A fire at the depot in Regina in 1911 destroyed almost all of the new rifles. The NWMP then gave up on the Ross.
* Magazine Lee-Enfield (MLE) Mk.I rifle – issued in .303 British; it was the first smokeless powder weapon in NWMP service. Loaned to the NWMP from the Victoria and Winnipeg militias to replace a stolen cache of M1876 Winchesters. The NWMP &quot;forgot&quot; to give them back later. Used from 1902 to 1920. 
* Lee-Metford carbine – issued in .303 British. The Metford rifling gave tighter groups when fired than the later Enfield, but the rifling wore out faster. Only 200 were procured. Used from 1895 to 1914. Replaced by the Lee-Enfield carbine.
* Winchester Model 1876 saddle carbineissued in .45-75 Winchester. Popular for its handiness and rate of fire, but it was too fragile for the rough handling and use it received in the field. Used from 1878 until 1914. and replaced by the Lee-Enfield Carbine.
* Snider–Enfield Mark III cavalry carbine – issued in .577 Snider. Single-shot breach-loading conversion of an Enfield caplock muzzle-loader. Used from 1873 to 1878 and replaced by the Winchester Model 1876 lever-action rifle.

;Service pistols
* Smith &amp; Wesson &quot;military and police&quot; revolverissued with barrel, in .38 Special. It served more than forty years from 1954 to 1996. Plainclothes members carried a variant with a barrel. 
**In 1981, the standard loading was changed from a .38 Special full metal jacket (FMJ) ball round to a .38 Special +P semi-wadCutter hollow-point (SWCHP), a violation of the Hague Convention of 1899 if used in a military context.
* Colt &quot;New Service&quot; revolver – issued with 5.5 in (140 mm) barrel; 700 ordered in .455 Webley in 1904, with .45 Long Colt versions being delivered from 1919; in all, over 3,200 were issued. 455 Webley was the British military service round, and .45 Long Colt was the standard Canadian service round until both were replaced by the NATO-standard 9×19mm Parabellum post World War II. Used from 1904 to 1954. 
* Enfield Mark II revolverissued in .476 Enfield, about 1080 Mark IIs obtained from Britain&#x27;s Ministry of Defence, after it was learned the Beaumont–Adams had been discontinued. The remaining .450 Adams ammunition, which was compatible with the .476 Enfield round, was issued until stocks were depleted. Used from 1882 to 1911.
* Beaumont–Adams revolverfirst issue weapon, in .450 Adams. 330 Mark Icas was purchased from Britain&#x27;s Ministry of Defence in 1873 and issued after delivery in 1874. Rough handling of the crates in transit, poor packing by the contractor who shipped the guns, and previous service wear made them unsuitable for service. The constables sometimes had to manually turn the cylinders due to cracked feed hands or keep both hands on the grips for the springs to work due to loose screws. Later, these were to be replaced by 330 Enfield Mark IIs, but many were stolen en route. Used from 1874 to 1888.
;Pistols
Due to procurement problems with the Beaumont–Adams revolvers, constables sometimes carried their sidearms chambered in a standard service calibre.
* Tranter revolver – chambered in .450 Adams, the standard service round. It was similar to the Beaumont-Adams revolver it was substituted for.
* Smith &amp; Wesson Model 3 revolver – chambered in .44 Russian, a very powerful cartridge in its day. Thirty were purchased in 1874 by the NWMP to field-test the .44 Russian round for service. Its non-standard chambering and the difficulty of getting ammunition for it led to its being withdrawn.
* Webley &amp; Scott Bull Dog revolver – chambered in .450 Adams. Its small size made it a handy backup pistol. Most were originally procured to arm NWMP constables assigned to protecting mail cars on trains. The constables would sometimes &quot;absent-mindedly forget&quot; to hand the pistols back afterwards.

;Sidearms
* 1821 pattern light cavalry sabre – Originally part of a trove of old swords given by the Canadian Militia to the NWMP as weapons. They were returned to stores in 1880. Later issued to commissioned officers in 1882 as ceremonial sidearms and a sign of rank. This was later replaced by the M1896 light cavalry sabre.
* 1853 pattern cavalry sabre – Originally part of a trove of old swords given by the Canadian Militia to the NWMP as weapons. They were returned to stores in 1880. Later issued in 1882 to non-commissioned officers as ceremonial sidearms and a sign of rank. This was later replaced by the 1821 pattern sabre. 
* 1896 pattern light cavalry sabre – Replaced the 1821 pattern sabre as the NWMP officer&#x27;s ceremonial sword.
* 1908 pattern cavalry sabre – Carried by the Mounted Police detachment sent to Siberia in 1918 during the Russian Civil War. 
* Straightstick baton manufactured in wood and plastic
* Sap gloves – Prohibited by RCMP policy. Presently not used.

====Ceremonial weapons and symbols of office====
* 1912 pattern cavalry officer&#x27;s sword carried by officers. The blade is acid etched on both sides with the monarch&#x27;s crown, Canadian coat of Arms, royal cypher, and RCMP badge.
* 1908 pattern cavalry sword carried by NCOs on the Musical Ride
* Bamboo-shafted lance carried by members on horseback on the Musical Ride. The lance is used as a decorative item and flourishes during trick and formation riding. The pennant is red over white, the national colours of the Canadian flag. It represents the Pattern 1868 cavalry lance carried by the NWMP in the 1870s.
* Drill cane
* Swagger stick
* Commissioner&#x27;s tipstaff

In 1973, Wilkinson Sword produced several commemorative swords to celebrate the RCMP centennial. None of these swords was ever used ceremonially and were strictly collectables. Wilkinson Sword also made a commemorative centennial tomahawk and miniature &quot;letter opener&quot; models of their centennial swords. During the same year, Winchester Repeating Arms Company produced an RCMP commemorative centennial version of their Model 94 rifle in .30-30 Winchester, with a round barrel. The receiver, buttplate, and forend cap (on the musket-style forend) were plated in gold. Commemorative medallions were embedded in the right-hand side of the stock, with an &quot;MP&quot; engraving. There was engraving on the barrel and receiver indicating the rifle was a centennial commemorative edition. Sights were open notch rear, with a flip-up rear ladder, graduated to . Two versions were produced, 9500 with serial numbers beginning &quot;RCMP&quot; for commercial sale, and 5000 with the prefix &quot;MP&quot; sold only to serving RCMP members. In addition, ten presentation models were produced, serially RCMP1P to RCMP10P.

==Uniform==
===Operational uniform===

RCMP officers on frontline police duties wear grey shirts with RCMP shoulder flashes, navy blue pants with gold trouser piping, bulletproof vests, and a peaked cap with a solid gold band. High-ranking officers wear white shirts. A tie can be worn with a long-sleeved shirt for occasions such as testifying in court. In colder weather, members may wear heavier boots, winter coats, wool toques, or uniquely, muskrat fur caps.

In 1990, Baltej Singh Dhillon became the RCMP&#x27;s first Sikh officer to be allowed to wear a turban instead of the traditional campaign hat. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Sikh, Muslim, and other bearded officers were initially assigned to administrative duties before being permitted to attend calls for service with low viral transmission risks after officer outcry. The beards required as part of the Sikh practice of kesh and worn by some Muslim men prevented respirator masks from properly sealing around the mouth and nose, reducing their effectiveness. As of 2019, all RCMP officers, regardless of religious belief, are allowed to wear full beards or braided hair below their collar. Officers may also wear a ballcap in place of the traditional peaked cap.

===Dress uniform===

RCMP officers are equipped with a dress uniform, popularly known as the &quot;blue serge&quot;, for performing certain formal duties, such as media relations or parliament testimony. It consists of a navy blue dress jacket with epaulets and brass buttons, a white shirt, a navy blue tie, navy blue pants with gold trouser piping, and a peaked cap with a solid gold band. Shoulder flashes are not worn.

===Ceremonial uniform===
For most formal and ceremonial duties, RCMP wears the internationally-famous Red Serge. It has a high collared scarlet tunic, which was developed by the North-West Mounted Police and colored red to distinguish it from blue American military uniforms, midnight blue breeches with yellow trouser piping, an oxblood Sam Browne belt with white sidearm lanyard and matching oxblood riding boots, brown felt campaign hat with a &quot;Montana crease&quot; (pinched symmetrically at the four corners), and oxblood gloves. Since 1990, identical ceremonial uniforms have been worn by both men and women.

===Decorations===
Members receive a clasp and service badge star for every five years of service. The King of Canada also awards the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal to members who have completed 20 years of service. A clasp is awarded for each successive 5 years to 40 years. Members also receive a service badge star for each five years of service, which is worn on the left sleeve. There are specialist insignia for positions such as first aid instructor and dog handler, a fingerprint insignia for forensic identification specialists, and pilot&#x27;s wings worn by aviators. Sharpshooter badges for proficiency in pistol or rifle shooting are each awarded in two grades. Sharpshooter badges and service badge stars are sewn onto the left sleeve of the red serge.

===Tartan===

The RCMP has since 1998 had its own distinctive tartan. The creation of the tartan was the result of a committee created in the early 1990s to create a tartan by its 125th anniversary. Upon approval from Commissioner Phillip Murray, the tartan was registered with the Scottish Tartans Society and presented to the agency by Anne, Princess Royal during her royal visit to Canada in 1998. The tartan appeared for the first time by an RCMP pipe band at the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo in July and August 1998.

==Military status==
Although the RCMP is a civilian police service, in 1921, following the service of many of its members during the First World War, King George V awarded the service the status of a regiment of dragoons, entitling it to display the battle honours it had been awarded.

===Service in wartime===
The RCMP predecessor, the North-West Mounted Police, were involved in several battles during the North-West Resistance in 1885. During the Second Boer War, members of the NWMP were given leaves of absence to join the 2nd Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles (CMR) and Strathcona&#x27;s Horse. The service raised the Canadian Mounted Rifles, mostly from NWMP members, for service in South Africa. For the CMR&#x27;s distinguished service there, King Edward VII honoured the NWMP by changing the name to the &quot;Royal Northwest Mounted Police&quot; (RNWMP) on June 24, 1904.

During the First World War, the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP) conducted border patrols, surveillance of enemy aliens, and enforcement of national security regulations within Canada. However, RNWMP officers also served overseas. On August 6, 1914, a squadron of volunteers from the RNWMP was formed to serve with the Canadian Light Horse in France. In 1918, two more squadrons were raised, A Squadron for service in France and Flanders and B Squadron for service in the Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force.

In September 1939, at the outset of the Second World War, the Canadian Army had no military police. Five days after war was declared the Royal Canadian Mounted Police received permission to form a provost company of service volunteers. It was designated &quot;No. 1 Provost Company (RCMP)&quot;, and became the Canadian Provost Corps. Six months after war was declared its members were overseas in Europe and served throughout the Second World War as military police.

RCMP members were embedded with several military units in Afghanistan during the War in Afghanistan from 2001–14. The RCMP was a member agency of the Afghan Threat Finance Cell, a multi-agency intelligence organization formed in 2008.

===Honours===
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were accorded the status of a regiment of dragoons in 1921. As a cavalry regiment, the RCMP was entitled to wear battle honours for its war service as well as carry a guidon, with its first guidon presented in 1935. The second guidon was presented in 1973, and the third in 2023.

Battle honours

* North West Canada 1885
* South Africa 1900–1902
* France &amp; Flanders 1918
* Siberia 1918–19
* Second World War 1939–1945 
* Afghanistan 2003–14

The RCMP also carries the honorary distinctions for the Canadian Provost Corps (Military Police), presented September 21, 1957, at a Parliament Hill ceremony for contributions to the corps during the Second World War. The honorary distinction was recognized on the guidon presented in 2023 with its inclusion among other RCMP battle honors.

==Public perception==

The Mounties have been immortalized as symbols of Canadian culture in numerous Hollywood Northwestern movies and television series, which often feature the image of the Mountie as square-jawed, stoic, and polite, yet with a steely determination and physical toughness that sometimes appears superhuman. The RCMP&#x27;s motto is the French phrase, , variously translated into English as &quot;Defending the Law&quot;, &quot;Maintain the right&quot;, and &quot;Uphold the right&quot;. The Hollywood saying that they &#x27;always get their man&#x27; derives ultimately from the words &quot;They fetch their man every time&quot; occurring in a report made at Fort Benton regarding an incident at Fort Macleod in 1877, when two Mounties, notwithstanding the loss of their horses, managed to capture three whisky smugglers. 

In recent decades, Canadian public perception of the RCMP has become less favourable. In 2022 Angus Reid survey found that 41 per cent of Canadians had little or no confidence in the RCMP, compared to 37 per cent of Canadians served by a provincial police service. The study also found that the RCMP as a whole was less trusted compared to municipal police services or individual RCMP detachments.

During the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, several witnesses described apathy or disrespect on the part of officers taking statements about violence against Indigenous women, while others said that some officers declined to take statements altogether.

===Depictions in media===
In 1912, Ralph Connor&#x27;s &quot;Corporal Cameron of the North-West Mounted Police: A Tale of the MacLeod Trail&quot; appeared, and became an international best-selling novel. Mounties fiction became a popular genre in both pulp magazines and book form. Among the best-selling authors who specialized in tales of the Mounted Police were James Oliver Curwood, Laurie York Erskine, James B Hendryx, T Lund, Harwood Steele (the son of Sam Steele), and William Byron Mowery.

In other media, a famous example is the radio and television series, &quot;Sergeant Preston of the Yukon.&quot; Dudley Do-Right (of &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;) is a 1960s example of the comic aspect of the Mountie myth, as is Klondike Kat, from Total Television. The Broadway musical and Hollywood movie &quot;Rose-Marie&quot; is a 1930s example of its romantic side. A successful combination was a series of &quot;Renfrew of the Royal Mounted&quot; boy&#x27;s adventure novels written by Laurie York Erskine beginning in 1922 and running to 1941. In the 1930s Erskine narrated a &quot;Sgt Renfrew of the Mounties&quot; radio show and a series of films with actor-singer James Newill playing Renfrew were released between 1937 and 1940. In 1953 portions of the films were mixed with new sequences of Newill for a &quot;Renfrew of the Mounted&quot; television series.

Bruce Carruthers (1901–1953), a former Mounted Police corporal (1919–1923), served as an unofficial technical advisor to Hollywood in many films with RCMP characters. They included &quot;Heart of the North&quot; (1938), &quot;Susannah of the Mounties&quot; (1939), &quot;Northern Pursuit&quot; (1943), &quot;Gene Autry and The Mounties&quot; (1951), &quot;The Wild North&quot; (1952), and &quot;The Pony Soldier&quot; (1952).

====Contemporary culture====
In 1959, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired &quot;R.C.M.P.&quot;, a half-hour dramatic series about an RCMP detachment keeping the peace and fighting crime. Filmed in black and white, in and around Ottawa by Crawley Films, the series was co-produced with the BBC and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and ran for 39 episodes. It was noted for its pairing of Québécois and Anglo officers.
Canadians also poke fun at the RCMP with Sergeant Renfrew and his faithful dog Cuddles in various sketches produced by the &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; comedy troupe. On &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; Mounties were played by SCTV alumni Joe Flaherty and Dave Thomas. The British have also exploited the myth: the BBC television series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; featured a group of Mounties singing the chorus in &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; in the lumberjack sketch. The 1972–90 CBC series &quot;The Beachcombers&quot; features a character named Constable John Constable who attempts to enforce the law in the town of Gibsons, British Columbia. In comic books, the Marvel Comics characters of Alpha Flight are described on several occasions as &quot;RCMP auxiliaries&quot;, and two of their members, Snowbird and the second Major Mapleleaf are depicted as serving members of the service. In the latter case, due to trademark issues, Major Mapleleaf is described as a &quot;Royal Canadian Mountie&quot; in the opening roll call pages of each issue of &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; he appears in.

Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin starred in the 1981 movie &quot;Death Hunt&quot; that fictionalized the RCMP pursuit of Albert Johnson. British comedian Tony Slattery appeared as &#x27;Malcolm the Mountie&#x27; in a series of UK TV adverts for Labatt&#x27;s in the early 1990s. In the early 1990s, Canadian professional wrestler Jacques Rougeau utilized the gimmick of &quot;The Mountie&quot; while wrestling for the WWF. He typically wore the Red Serge to the ring and carried a shock stick as an illegal weapon. As his character was portrayed as an evil Mountie, the RCMP ultimately won an injunction preventing Rougeau from wrestling as this character in Canada, though he was not prevented from doing so outside the country. He briefly held the Intercontinental Championship in 1992.

The 1998 swan song of Nick Berry&#x27;s time on UK drama &quot;Heartbeat&quot; features his character, Sergeant Nick Rowan, transferring to Canada and taking the rank of constable in the Mounties. The special telemovie was titled &quot;Heartbeat: Changing Places.&quot; The 1994–98 TV series &quot;Due South&quot; pairs Mountie Constable Benton Fraser with streetwise American detective Ray Vecchio cleaning up the streets of Chicago. It mainly derives its entertainment from the perceived differences in attitude and culture between these two countries&#x27; police services. Fraser is depicted as honest and polite to a fault, even refusing to carry a loaded sidearm when &quot;assisting&quot; Detective Vecchio but is almost superhuman in his abilities for thwarting crime, especially while wearing the Red Serge uniform. A pair of Mounties staff the RCMP detachment in the fictional town of Lynx River, Northwest Territories, in the CBC series &quot;North of 60.&quot; The series, which aired from 1992 to 1998, is about events in the mostly Indigenous community, but the Mounties feature prominently in each episode. Another TV series from the 1990s, &quot;Bordertown&quot; features an NWMP corporal paired with a U.S. marshal securing law and order on a frontier U.S.–Canada border town. In the ABC TV mini-series &quot;Answered by Fire&quot;, at least three Mounties are featured. Mounties also appear in the TV series &quot;When Calls the Heart&quot; (Hallmark Channel).

The 1987 Brian De Palma film &quot;The Untouchables&quot; features cooperation between the Treasury Department task force, led by Eliot Ness, and the Mounties against liquor smuggling across the Canada–United States border. The 1995 album &quot;C&#x27;est Cheese&quot; by Canadian musical comedy group The Arrogant Worms includes &quot;The Mountie Song&quot;, which tells the story of a dissatisfied Mountie. In his 1999, album &quot;Soiree&quot; Newfoundland musician A. Frank Willis included &quot;Savage Cop in Savage Cove&quot; which was based on a true story and went on to become a big hit. Conan O&#x27;Brien brought his late night show to Toronto in February 2004. O&#x27;Brien spent a day as a Mountie at the Canada–United States border.

In 2009, a 13-part documentary about the RCMP released, &quot;Courage in Red&quot;, was released. From 2011, the CTV fantasy drama series &quot;The Listener&quot; regularly features characters who work for the Integrated Investigative Bureau, a fictional division of the RCMP that brings together various specialists, officers, and civilian consultants to work on high-profile or federal cases. Although characters in the employ of the IIB are rarely, if ever, depicted wearing uniform, they are often addressed by their ranks—two main characters are Sergeant Michelle McClusky and Corporal Dev Clark.

In the 2021 TV series &quot;Leverage Redemption&quot; it is revealed characters Elliot Spencer, Sophie Devereaux, Parker, and Breanna Casey will not do jobs in Canada because of the RCMP, who want them for various crimes. The four claim the RCMP is the most dangerous police service in the world, will put you down politely and never forget a face, and that Mounties hate being called &quot;Dudley Do-Right.&quot;

===Merchandise and trademarks===
There are products and merchandise that are made in the image of the RCMP, like Mountie statues or hats. Before 1995, the RCMP had little control over these products. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police received an international license on April 1, 1995, requiring those who use the RCMP to pay a licensing fee. Proceeds from the fees are used for community awareness programs. Those that do not pay the licensing fee are legally unable to use the name of the RCMP or their correct uniforms, though a film such as &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; used the name &quot;Royal Mounted Canadian Police&quot; and the character in the &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; film did not wear accurate insignia.

Through a master licensing agreement (MLA) with the RCMP, the RCMP Foundation is responsible for managing the commercial use of the RCMP name, image, and protected marks. The foundation issues selected companies a royalty-based agreement allowing them to produce and market high-quality official RCMP merchandise. Walt Disney Co. (Canada) Ltd. was contracted to aid in the initial set up of the licensing program, but Disney never owned or controlled any of the RCMP&#x27;s protected marks. Following the expiration of the Disney contract in 2000, all responsibilities and activities were taken over by the executive director and his staff, reporting to the foundation president and board of directors. In 2007, through a decree signed by Commissioner Beverley Busson, the operating name was changed to the &quot;Royal Canadian Mounted Police Foundation&quot;.

===Public relations program===

RCMP community relationship-building programs include the Musical Ride. The Musical Ride is an equestrian showcase of RCMP riders, that performs across Canada each year from May to October. The RCMP Sunset Ceremony () has taken place every summer since 1989 at the Musical Ride Centre in Ottawa, with it in recent years featuring the Ottawa Police Service Pipe Band and the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards Band. The RCMP National Ceremonial Troop is a unit that serves as dismounted version of the Musical Ride as well as a drill team. Individual divisions also have their ceremonial troops.

The RCMP Heritage Centre is a multi-million-dollar museum designed by Arthur Erickson that opened in May 2007 in Regina, Saskatchewan, at the RCMP Academy, Depot Division. It replaced the old RCMP museum and is designed to celebrate the role of the service in Canada&#x27;s history.

====Bands====

There are eight regional RCMP pipe bands across Canada that act as &quot;garrison bands&quot; for the provincial division, and attend parades, police ceremonies, and public events. The first of these bands were established in 1992 in Alberta. The following are the locations of the regional volunteer pipe bands:
*Halifax
*Moncton
*Montreal (part of &quot;C&quot; Division)
*Ottawa
*Winnipeg
*Regina (part of &quot;F&quot; Division)
*Edmonton
*Vancouver (part of &quot;E&quot; Division)
Before 1994, the RCMP also operated the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Band () was the RCMP&#x27;s central musical ensemble. It was considered one of the best professional bands assembled in Canada. Although it was an official regimental band, the members worked in the band as a secondary job. It is generally considered to have begun in 1938, though various police bands in the RCMP flourished at the time, leading the Canadian government approving the creation of a full-time central band in December 1958, with its headquarters in the capital of Ottawa. Appearances made by the band included Expo 86 and the Commonwealth Conference in Vancouver, the Calgary Winter Olympics in 1988, as well as the visits of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Queen Elizabeth II in 1990.

It was dissolved in 1994 due to government budget cuts. In its 55-year existence, it operated as a voluntary regimental band, with its members working with it as a secondary job apart from their other duties in the RCMP. Members of the band wore the RCMP&#x27;s Red Serge as part of their full dress uniform and adopted drill seen in Canadian military bands and bands in the British Army. Its longest-serving director was Superintendent Edwin Joseph Lydall, who served from 1948 to 1968.

The main antagonists in most of their adventures are the two Russian-like spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, both working for the Nazi-like dictator Fearless Leader. Supporting segments include &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; (a parody of old-time melodrama), &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot; (a dog named Mr. Peabody and his boy Sherman traveling through time), and &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot; (classic fairy tales retold in comic fashion), among others. 

The current blanket title was imposed for home video releases more than 40 years after the series originally aired and was never used when the show was televised; television airings of the show were broadcast under the titles of Rocky and His Friends from 1959 to 1961 on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons on ABC (and again in Canada in 1963), The Bullwinkle Show from 1961 to 1964 on Sunday evening and then late Sunday afternoon on NBC, and The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show (or The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle) as repeats from 1964-73 on Sunday mornings on ABC and in syndication following this.

&quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; is known for quality writing and wry humor. Mixing puns, cultural and topical satire, and self-referential humor, it appealed to adults as well as children. It was also one of the first cartoons whose animation was outsourced; storyboards were shipped to Gamma Productions, a Mexican studio also employed by Total Television. The art has a choppy, unpolished look and the animation is extremely limited even by television animation standards at the time, yet the series has long been held in high esteem; some critics described the series as a well-written radio program with pictures.

The show was shuffled around several times during its run, airing in afternoon, prime time, and Saturday-morning cartoon timeslots, and was influential to other animated series from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;. Segments from the series were later recycled in the &quot;Hoppity Hooper&quot; show. There have been numerous feature film adaptations of the series&#x27; various segments, such as the 2000 film &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, which blended live-action and computer animation; and the 1999 live-action film &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot;. Both films received poor reviews and were financially unsuccessful. By contrast, an animated feature film adaptation of the &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot; segment, &quot;Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman&quot;, was released to positive reviews in 2014, but was also financially unsuccessful. A rebooted animated series also based on &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot;, &quot;The Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman Show&quot;, debuted on Netflix in October 2015 and ran to April 2017.

Another reboot animated series based on the main and final segments, &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; premiered on Amazon Prime Video on May 11, 2018. In 2013, &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; and &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot; were ranked the sixth-greatest television cartoon of all time by &quot;TV Guide&quot;.

==Background==
The idea for the series came from Jay Ward and Alex Anderson, who previously collaborated on &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot;, based upon the original property &quot;The Frostbite Falls Revue&quot;. This original show never got beyond the proposal stage. It featured a group of forest animals running a television station. The group included Rocket J. Squirrel (Rocky), Oski Bear, Canadian Moose (Bullwinkle), Sylvester Fox, Blackstone Crow, and Floral Fauna. The show in this form was created by Alex Anderson. (The bear and fox characters would later be retooled for Ward&#x27;s next series, &quot;Hoppity Hooper&quot;.) Bullwinkle&#x27;s name came from the name of a car dealership in Berkeley, California, called Bullwinkel Motors. Anderson changed the order of the last two letters of the name and gave the name to his moose.

Ward wanted to produce the show in Los Angeles, but Anderson lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and did not want to relocate. As a result, Ward hired Bill Scott as head writer and co-producer at Jay Ward Productions, and he wrote the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; features. Ward was joined by writers Chris Hayward and Allan Burns; they eventually became known for creating &quot;The Munsters&quot; with Burns going to co-create &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. In a 1982 interview, Scott said, &quot;I got a call from Jay asking if I&#x27;d be interested in writing another series, an adventure script with a moose and a squirrel. I said, &#x27;Sure.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t know if I could write an adventure with a moose and a squirrel, but I never turned down a job.&quot;

===Production===
The series began with the pilot &quot;Rocky the Flying Squirrel&quot;. Production began in February 1958 with the hiring of voice actors June Foray, Paul Frees, Bill Scott, and William Conrad. Eight months later, General Mills signed a deal to sponsor the cartoon program, under the condition that the show be run in a late-afternoon time slot, when it could be targeted toward children. Subsequently, Ward hired the rest of the production staff, including writers and designers. However, no animators were hired. Ad executives at Dancer, Fitzgerald and Sample, the advertising agency for General Mills, set up an animation studio in Mexico called Gamma Productions S.A. de C.V., originally known as Val-Mar Animation. This outsourcing of the animation for the series was considered financially attractive by primary sponsor General Mills, but caused endless production problems. In a 1982 interview by animation historian Jim Korkis, Bill Scott described some of the problems that arose during production of the series:

We found out very quickly that we could not depend on Mexican studios to produce anything of quality. They were turning out the work very quickly and there were all kinds of mistakes and flaws and boo-boos... They would never check... Mustaches popped on and off Boris, Bullwinkle&#x27;s antlers would change, colors would change, costumes would disappear... By the time we finally saw it, it was on the air.

===Network television: 1959–1973===

The show was broadcast for the first time on November 19, 1959, on the ABC television network, under the title &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot;, twice a week, on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, following &quot;American Bandstand&quot; at 4:30 p.m. ET, where it was the highest-rated daytime network program. The show moved to the NBC network starting September 24, 1961, broadcast in color, and first appeared on Sundays at 7:00 p.m., just before &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot;. &quot;Bullwinkle&quot;″s ratings suffered as a result of airing opposite perennial favorite &quot;Lassie&quot;. A potential move to CBS caused NBC to reschedule the show to late Sunday afternoons (5:30 p.m.) and early Saturday afternoons in its final season. NBC canceled the show in the summer of 1964. It was shopped to ABC, but they were not interested. However, reruns of episodes were aired on ABC&#x27;s Sunday morning schedule at 11:00 a.m. until 1973, at which time the series went into syndication.

An abbreviated 15-minute version of the series ran in syndication in the 1960s under the title &quot;The Rocky Show&quot;. This version was sometimes shown in conjunction with &quot;The King and Odie&quot;, a 15-minute version of Total Television&#x27;s &quot;King Leonardo and His Short Subjects&quot;. &quot;The King and Odie&quot; was similar to &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; in that it was sponsored by General Mills and animated by Gamma Productions.

&quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot; returned to network television during the 1981-1982 season, when NBC aired it at 12:30 p.m. ET Saturday afternoons. These were rebroadcasts of the original 35mm network prints as Jay Ward produced them, without the Total Television fillers added to the 16mm syndication prints.

===Syndication===

Reruns of the show aired on ABC from 1964 to 1973 and from 1981 to 1982 on NBC. On cable, the series had extended runs on Nickelodeon (1992–1996), Cartoon Network (1996–2003) and Boomerang (mid 2000s). Since the late 2000s, The Program Exchange has typically only licensed the series for short-term runs; nationally, the series has seen limited airings on WGN America (2009), VH1 Classic (2012), and Boomerang (2013). Since The Program Exchange&#x27;s demise, the series has resurfaced over-the-air on MeTV Toons as of 2024, airing under the title &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot; for the first time on American television, however the series&#x27; broadcast on the station has been paused since January 2025 per request of WildBrain.

&quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot; remained in syndicated reruns and was still available for local television stations through The Program Exchange as late as 2016; WBBZ-TV, for instance, aired the show in a strip to counterprogram 10 PM newscasts in the Buffalo, New York, market during the summer 2013 season. The underlying rights are now owned by WildBrain, who acquired the licensing, production, and distribution rights to Ward&#x27;s library in 2022. These rights were previously held by Universal Pictures, which acquired the library of predecessor companies DreamWorks Animation and Classic Media in 2016 (coinciding with The Program Exchange&#x27;s shutdown), and who in turn with copyright holder Ward Productions formed the joint venture Bullwinkle Studios, which managed the Rocky and Bullwinkle properties. Despite the move, Universal still owns the rights to the co-productions Ward produced with DreamWorks.

Sponsor General Mills retained all United States television rights to the series. Two packages, each containing different episodes, are available. The syndicated version of &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot; contains 98 half-hour shows (#801–898). The first 78 comprise the Rocky and Bullwinkle story lines from the first two seasons of the original series (these segments originally aired under the &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; title). Other elements in the half-hour shows (&quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot;, &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot;, &quot;Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties&quot;, &quot;Aesop and Son&quot;, and short cartoons including &quot;Bullwinkle&#x27;s Corner&quot; and &quot;Mr. Know-It-All&quot;) sometimes appear out of the original broadcast sequence. The final 20 syndicated &quot;Bullwinkle Show&quot; episodes feature later &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; story lines (from &quot;Bumbling Bros. Circus&quot; through the end of the series, minus &quot;Moosylvania&quot;) along with &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot;, &quot;Bullwinkle&#x27;s Corner&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Know-It-All&quot; segments repeated from earlier in the syndicated episode cycle. Originally, many syndicated shows included segments of Total Television&#x27;s &quot;The World of Commander McBragg&quot;, but these cartoons were replaced with other segments when the shows were remastered in the early 1990s. A package, promoted under the &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; name but utilizing &quot;The Rocky Show&quot; titles, features story lines not included in the syndicated &quot;Bullwinkle Show&quot; series.

The most recently syndicated &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; package retains the 15-minute format, consisting of 156 individual episodes, but like &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot;, the content differs from the versions syndicated in the 1960s. The various supporting segments, including &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot; (91), &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot; (91), and &quot;Aesop and Son&quot; (39) segments are syndicated as part of &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales&quot;, and 38 of the 39 &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; cartoons are syndicated as part of &quot;Dudley Do Right &quot;(sic)&quot; and Friends&quot;. Syndicated versions of the shows distributed outside of the United States and Canada combine the various segments under the package title &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot;; it is this version of the show that is represented on official DVD releases through DreamWorks Classics and the official online version sold at websites such as Amazon Video.

==Characters==

The lead characters and heroes of the series were Rocket &quot;Rocky&quot; J. Squirrel, a flying squirrel (who anchored the perspective of the show&#x27;s younger audience), and his best friend Bullwinkle J. Moose, a dimwitted but good-natured moose (who carried a bulk of the adult humor with his spontaneous puns). Both characters lived in the fictional town of Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, which was purportedly based on the real city of International Falls, Minnesota. The scheming villains in most episodes were the fiendish spies Boris Badenov (a pun on Boris Godunov) and Natasha Fatale (a pun on femme fatale), forever attempting to &quot;catch Moose and Squirrel&quot;. Other characters included Fearless Leader, the dictator of the fictitious nation of Pottsylvania and Boris and Natasha&#x27;s superior; Gidney &amp; Cloyd, little green men from the Moon who were armed with scrooch guns; Captain Peter &quot;Wrongway&quot; Peachfuzz, the captain of the S.S. &quot;Andalusia&quot;; various U.S. government bureaucrats and politicians (such as Senator Fussmussen, a recurring character who opposed admitting Alaska and Hawaii to the Union on the grounds of his own xenophobia); and the inevitable onlookers, Edgar and Chauncy.

==Structure==
When first shown on NBC, the cartoons were introduced by a Bullwinkle puppet, voiced by Bill Scott, who would often lampoon celebrities, current events, and especially Walt Disney, whose program &quot;Wonderful World of Color&quot; was next on the schedule. Compared with the dim-witted and lovable moose that most fans of the series would grow up with, in this short-lived version Bullwinkle was portrayed as a sarcastic smart-aleck. On one occasion, &quot;Bullwinkle&quot; encouraged children to pull the tuning knobs off their television sets. (&quot;It&#x27;s loads of fun, and that way, you&#x27;ll be sure to be with us next week!&quot;) The network received complaints from parents of an estimated 20,000 child viewers who actually did so. Bullwinkle told the children the following week to put the knobs back on with glue &quot;and make it stick!&quot; The puppet sequence was dropped altogether. Scott later re-used the puppet for a segment called &quot;Dear Bullwinkle,&quot; where letters written for the show were read and answered humorously. Four episodes of &quot;Dear Bullwinkle&quot; are on the Season 1 DVD.

Each episode is composed of two &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; cliffhanger shorts that stylistically emulated early radio and film serials. The plots of these shorts would combine into story arcs spanning numerous episodes. The first and longest story arc was &quot;Jet Fuel Formula&quot; consisting of 40 shorts (20 episodes). Stories ranged from seeking the missing ingredient for a rocket fuel formula, to tracking the monstrous whale &quot;Maybe Dick&quot;, to an attempt to prevent mechanical metal-munching moon mice from devouring the nation&#x27;s television antennas. Rocky and Bullwinkle frequently encounter the two Pottsylvanian nogoodniks, Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale.

At the end of most episodes, the narrator, William Conrad, would announce two humorous titles for the next episode that typically were puns of each other (and usually related more to the current predicament than to the plot of the next episode). For example, during an adventure taking place in a mountain range, the narrator would state, &quot;Be with us next time for &#x27;Avalanche Is Better Than None,&#x27; or &#x27;Snow&#x27;s Your Old Man. Such a &#x27;This&#x27; or &#x27;That&#x27; title announcement was borrowed from &quot;The Adventures of Sam Spade&quot; radio shows produced in 1946–1950. The narrator frequently spoke with the characters, thus breaking the fourth wall.

Episodes were introduced with one of four opening sequences:
* Rocky flies about snow-covered mountains. Below him, hiking on a snowy trail, Bullwinkle is distracted by a billboard featuring his name, and walks off a ledge. He becomes a large snowball as he rolls downhill. Rocky flies to him and pushes against the snowball, slowing it to a halt at the edge of another cliff. Bullwinkle pops out of the snowball to catch the teetering squirrel at the cliff edge.
* In a circus, Rocky is preparing to jump from a high diving board into a tub of water tended by Bullwinkle. However, when Rocky jumps, he ends up flying around the circus tent, while Bullwinkle chases after him carrying the tub. As Rocky lands safely, Bullwinkle tumbles into the tub. This was the same intro used for the Buena Vista VHS series in the early 1990s.
* Rocky is flying acrobatically about a city landscape. Bullwinkle is high atop a flagpole painting, and is knocked from his perch as the squirrel flies by. Rocky attempts to catch the plummeting moose with a butterfly net, but the moose falls through. Rocky then flies lower to find his friend suspended from a clothesline, having fallen into a pair of long johns.
* Similar to the previous opening, Rocky is again flying about the city. Bullwinkle is suspended from a safety harness posting a sign on a large billboard. He loses his balance as the squirrel zooms past him and tumbles off the platform. The moose lands on a banner pole mounted on the side of a building, and the recoil springs him back into the air. He lands on a store awning, slides down, and drops a few feet to a bench on which Rocky is seated. The impact launches the squirrel off the bench, and Bullwinkle nonchalantly catches him in his left hand to end the sequence.

Episodes ended with a bumper sequence in which a violent lightning storm destroys the landscape, appearing to engulf Rocky and Bullwinkle in the destruction and accompanied by dramatic piano music. The music would become more lighthearted, and the ground would scroll upward while the outlines of the heroes gradually appeared. We then see a smiling sun overlooking a barren field which rapidly fills with sunflowers until Rocky and Bullwinkle finally sprout from the ground.

==Supporting features==
The &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; shorts serve as &quot;bookends&quot; for popular supporting features, including:
* &quot;Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties&quot;, a parody of early-20th-century melodrama and silent film serials of the Northern genre. Dudley Do-Right is a Canadian Mountie in constant pursuit of his nemesis, Snidely Whiplash, who sports the standard &quot;villain&quot; attire of black top hat, cape, and large handlebar moustache. This is one of the few Jay Ward cartoons to feature a background music track (by Dennis Farnon). As is standard in Ward&#x27;s cartoons, jokes often have more than one meaning. A standard gag is to introduce characters in an irised close-up with the name of fictional actors displayed in a caption below, a convention seen in some early silent films. The names are usually silly names or subtle puns, e.g., Abraham Wilkes Booth as Dudley Do-Right, Sweetness N. Light as Nell Fenwick, and Claud Hopper as Snidely Whiplash. On one occasion, Whiplash&#x27;s role is credited to the then-incarcerated bank robber Willie Sutton. Occasionally, even the scenery is introduced in this manner, as when &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Gulch&quot; is identified as being portrayed by &quot;Gorgeous Gorge,&quot; a reference to professional wrestler Gorgeous George.

* &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot; features a genius talking dog named Mr. Peabody who has a pet human boy named Sherman. Mr. Peabody is named after a dog belonging to Scott&#x27;s son John; Sherman is named after UPA director Sherman Glas. Peabody and Sherman use Peabody&#x27;s &quot;WABAC machine&quot; (pronounced &quot;way-back&quot;, spelled WAYBAC in season 1, episode 4 (&quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;), and partially a play on words of the names of early computers such as UNIVAC and ENIAC) to go back in time to discover the &quot;real&quot; story behind historical events, and in many cases, intervene with uncooperative historical figures to ensure that events transpire as history has recorded. The term &quot;Wayback Machine&quot; is used to this day in Internet applications such as Wikipedia and the Internet Archive to refer to the ability to see or revert to older content. These segments are famous for including a terrible pun at the end. Perhaps the worst one appears in the &quot;Mata Hari&quot; episode, where Peabody explains that the entire population of Scotland was evacuated in a zeppelin: &quot;one nation in dirigible.&quot; 
* &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot; presented familiar fairy tales and children&#x27;s stories, but with altered, modernized storylines for humorous, satirical effect. This segment was narrated by Edward Everett Horton; June Foray, Bill Scott, Paul Frees, and Daws Butler supplied the voices. A typical example was their spin on &quot;Sleeping Beauty.&quot; In this version, the prince (a caricature of Walt Disney) &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot; wake up Sleeping Beauty; instead, he builds a theme-park around her (&quot;Sleeping Beautyland&quot;), and gets headlines in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine (&quot;Doze Doll Duz Wiz Biz&quot; and &quot;Doze Doll Dull&quot;).
* &quot;Aesop and Son&quot; is similar to &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot;, complete with the same theme music, except it deals with fables instead of fairy tales. The typical structure consists of Aesop attempting to teach a lesson to his son using a fable. After hearing the story, the son subverts the fable&#x27;s moral with a pun. This structure was also suggested by the feature&#x27;s opening titles, which showed Aesop painstakingly carving his name in marble using a mallet and chisel and then his son, with a jackhammer and raising a cloud of dust, appending &quot;And Son.&quot; Aesop was voiced (uncredited) by actor Charlie Ruggles and the son, Junior, was voiced by Daws Butler.
* &quot;Bullwinkle&#x27;s Corner&quot; features the dimwitted moose attempting to introduce culture into the proceedings by reciting (and acting out) poems and nursery rhymes, inadvertently and humorously butchering them. Poems subjected to this treatment include several by Robert Louis Stevenson (&quot;My Shadow&quot;, &quot;The Swing&quot;, and &quot;Where Go the Boats&quot;); William Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Daffodils&quot;; &quot;Little Miss Muffet&quot;, &quot;Little Jack Horner&quot;, and &quot;Wee Willie Winkie&quot;; J. G. Whittier&#x27;s &quot;Barbara Frietchie&quot;; and &quot;The Queen of Hearts&quot; by Charles Lamb. Simple Simon is performed with Boris as the pie man, but as a variation of the famous Abbott and Costello routine &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;.
* &quot;Mr. Know-It-All&quot; again features Bullwinkle posing as an authority on any topic. Disaster inevitably ensues. Boris Badenov plays a variety of roles as Bullwinkle&#x27;s antagonist in most of the segments.
* &quot;The Bullwinkle and Rocky Fan Club&quot;, a series of abortive attempts by Rocky and Bullwinkle to conduct club business. The fan club consists only of Rocky, Bullwinkle, Boris, Natasha, and Captain Peter &quot;Wrongway&quot; Peachfuzz. These shorts portray the characters as somewhat out of character, with even more fourth-wall breaks than in the story arcs.

Some later syndication prints of &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot; include short segments of &quot;The World of Commander McBragg&quot;: a tale-spinning windbag regaling a skeptical friend with exaggerated feats of heroism. These short features were never part of the Bullwinkle canon. They were actually prepared for &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales&quot; (and later shown on &quot;The Underdog Show&quot;). Although the shorts were animated by the same company, Gamma Productions of Mexico, they were produced for Total Television, rather than Ward Productions. These segments were packaged with pre-1990 syndicated versions of &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot; and appear in syndicated episodes of &quot;The Underdog Show&quot;, &quot;Dudley Do-Right and Friends&quot;, and &quot;Uncle Waldo&#x27;s Cartoon Show&quot;. Since 1990, this feature has been deleted from the Bullwinkle library and has never been included in Bullwinkle home videos.

==Voice cast==
==Cultural impact==
* In 1962, as a publicity stunt, Ward leased a small island on a lake between Minnesota and Canada, which he named after &quot;Moosylvania&quot;, a small island shown in the later &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; cartoons. In a campaign to make the island into the 51st state, he and Scott drove a van across the country to about 50–60 cities collecting petition signatures. Arriving in Washington, D.C., they pulled up to the White House gate to see President Kennedy, and were brusquely turned away. They had arrived during the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis.
* Also in 1962, British Invasion band Herman&#x27;s Hermits got its name because bandmates thought lead singer Peter Noone looked like Sherman of &quot;Mr. Peabody&quot; fame, and the name &quot;Herman&quot; was close enough to &quot;Sherman&quot; for them.
* In the sci-fi movie &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, Marty McFly is accidentally sent back in time to November 5, 1955, ending up on the Twin Pines Ranch, owned by &quot;Old Man Peabody,&quot; who angrily shoots at the DeLorean, mistaking it as a spaceship, taken from his son Sherman, when Marty, who was also mistaken as an alien, accidentally killed a pine sapling. Director Robert Zemeckis named the landowner after Mr. Peabody, the time-traveling dog: the subtle joke being that Mr. Peabody apparently did &quot;not&quot; take kindly to competing time-travelers.
* TSR, Inc. released &quot;Bullwinkle and Rocky Role-Playing Party Game&quot; in 1988, a roleplaying game based on the world of Rocky and Bullwinkle. The game consisted of rules, mylar hand puppets, cards, and spinners.
* Data East produced a pinball machine titled &quot;Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot; (1993).
* In 1999, Mattel made Rocky and Bullwinkle-themed cars under its Hot Wheels line.
* In 2002, &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; ranked #47 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.
* In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named Rocky and Bullwinkle as the joint third-greatest cartoon character of all time.
* In January 2009, IGN named &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; as the 11th-best animated television series.
* In 2012, Mr. Peabody and Sherman from the &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot; segment appeared in MetLife&#x27;s &quot;Everyone&quot; commercial during the 2012 Superbowl.
* To date, &quot;Rocky and Friends&quot; has aired in 100 countries.

==Revival attempts==
There were a few attempts to revive &quot;Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle&quot; throughout the 1970s. A revival in 1981 parodied the Super Bowl. A script was written, storyboards were produced, the NBC network gave it a green light, but the project was canceled because of objections from the NFL (actual team owners were parodied, the Super Bowl championship was lampooned as the &quot;Stupor Bowl&quot;, and Boris was fixing the game).

Another revival attempt took place at Disney in the mid-1980s, back when the company was distributing the show on VHS. Developed by Tad Stones and Michael Peraza Jr., the revival was named &quot;The Secret Adventures of Bullwinkle&quot; and would have been a modern take on the old Bullwinkle show, with the return of characters like Mr. Peabody and Sherman and Dudley Do-Right and would have featured new segments like &quot;Fractured Scary Tales&quot;, a parody of horror films, and a new &quot;Mr. Know It All&quot; skit that, among other things, had Bullwinkle programming a VCR. Before the two presented their pitch, they discovered Disney did not own the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; franchise, and the concept was abandoned.

==Home media==
The program debuted on home video with two compilation CED Videodiscs released by RCA during the format&#x27;s rise in the early 1980s, featuring complete, uncut story arcs and accompanying alternating segments and bumpers. Volume 1 contained the complete story for &quot;Wossamotta U&quot;, while volume 2 contained &quot;Goof Gas Attack&quot; and &quot;The Three Mooseketeers&quot;.

Buena Vista Home Video released the show on VHS, Betamax and LaserDisc in the early 1990s, under the title &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;. These are presented differently from when broadcast. Two &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; chapters were sometimes edited together into one (removing the &quot;titles&quot; for the next chapters as well as part of the recap at the beginning of the next), usually showing the storyline in four or five chapters per video. For example, the 12-episode &quot;Wossamotta U&quot; adventure is reduced to five episodes, and runs about seven minutes shorter. The &quot;Bullwinkle Show&quot; closing was used on these.

The first eight videos were released under the &quot;Classic Stuff&quot; banner, with covers and titles being parodies of famous paintings or painters. Four more videos were released under the &quot;Funny Stuff&quot; banner but, unlike the first eight, these were not numbered, the video titles matched the title of the featured &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; storyline, and the covers represented scenes from shows (such as Bullwinkle pulling a rhino out of a hat as the cover for &quot;Painting Theft&quot; (the change in the banner might have been due to a video magazine publishing a letter criticizing the editing).
===Gray market releases===
Years after the Buena Vista releases ended, another series of &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; VHS tapes were released, both separately and as a boxed set. These videos included &quot;Upsidaisium&quot;, &quot;The Last Angry Moose&quot;, &quot;Metal-Munching Mice&quot;, &quot;Much Mud&quot;, and &quot;Rue Britannia&quot;. However, these were released through GoodTimes Home Video and were not authorized by Ward Productions. The copies used were from 16 mm &quot;Bullwinkle Show&quot; prints. Some other companies also released unauthorized editions of &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, including Nostalgia Family Video, which also released all 98 of &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot; package shows via 16 mm &quot;Bullwinkle Show&quot; prints, and Bridgestone Multimedia, which released eight episodes as &quot;Rocky and his Friends&quot; using an old broadcast 16 mm print.

The copyright status of these 98 episodes (along with some episodes of &quot;Hoppity Hooper&quot;) is disputed. As of 2017, the copyright is generally recognized as valid, and attempts to post the gray-market releases on video sites have historically been greeted with DMCA take down notices.

In 2002, Jay Ward Productions established a partnership with Classic Media called Bullwinkle Studios. From 2003 to 2005, the partnership produced DVDs of the first three seasons of the series, which were renamed (for legal reasons) &quot;Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle &amp; Friends&quot;. Releases then stalled until 2010, when season 4 was released, in part to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the series. The complete series was released on January 4, 2011, marking the debut of season 5 on DVD. A standalone release of season 5 was released on March 29, 2011. The DVDs for the first three seasons were distributed by Sony Wonder, while seasons 4, 5, and Complete Series sets are currently distributed by Vivendi Entertainment. The complete series was re-released on DVD again on March 12, 2019, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, to celebrate the show&#x27;s 60th anniversary.

The DVD releases differ somewhat from the originals. The original opening bumpers as seen on the network run were restored, but the title of the show was replaced with the name &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot; (never used during the show&#x27;s television run) and a modern logo with styling inconsistent with the rest of the animation (pictured) somewhat clumsily inserted into the original bumpers. A William Conrad sound-alike (Keith Scott) was used to announce the new title, which some viewers found jarring. In addition, a semi-transparent &quot;R&amp;B&quot; logo appears for five seconds at the beginning of each segment in the lower right-hand corner. Some segments were moved from their position in the original episodes. Also, the season 5 shows on DVD recycle supporting features found on the DVDs for the first four seasons. Mathematically, this makes sense, since the total number of supporting features (assuming two used per show) exactly equals the number of shows created during the first four seasons. The first set, most of the second set, and the fifth season set use the second opening and closing used for the &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; broadcast, while the last two story arcs in the second set, as well as the third- and fourth-season sets, use the original opening and closing from the &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; broadcast. Frank Comstock&#x27;s musical themes are replaced on the sets with Fred Steiner&#x27;s music produced for &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot;. In addition, the first four season sets include optional Spanish-language audio tracks.

In 2005, Classic Media released a series of &quot;best of&quot; DVD compilations of popular segments of the series: two volumes of &quot;The Best of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, plus the single-volume &quot;The Best of Boris and Natasha&quot;, &quot;The Best of Mr. Peabody and Sherman&quot;, &quot;The Best of Fractured Fairy Tales&quot;, and &quot;The Best of Dudley Do-Right&quot;. These compilations contain episodes from the entire run of the show.

On October 30, 2012, Classic Media released a DVD called &quot;The Complete Fractured Fairy Tales&quot;, which includes all 91 &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot; segments.

On May 14, 2019, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released a 2-disc DVD called &quot;Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman: The Complete Collection&quot;, which includes all 91 &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot; segments.

During the time the show was available on Hulu (it was offered as a free series before it went to a subscription-only model), the DVD versions of the episodes were used instead of the syndication prints.

==Reboots==
On April 12, 2018, it was announced that a reboot of the series from DreamWorks Animation would premiere on Amazon Prime Video on May 11, 2018. The series is executive produced by Scott Fellows and Tiffany Ward (the daughter of Jay). The cast includes Tara Strong as Rocky, Brad Norman as Bullwinkle, Ben Diskin as Boris, Rachel Butera as Natasha, Piotr Michael as Fearless Leader, and Daran Norris as the Narrator.
On February 3, 2022, it was announced by &quot;Variety&quot; that WildBrain signed a deal with Jay Ward Productions to do another reboot of the franchise. WildBrain CEO Eric Ellenbogen and Jay Ward&#x27;s daughter Tiffany Ward are teaming up. As of 2024 no news on the reboot has been announced yet.

==In other media==

===Advertising===
* In 1966, the duo appeared between show segments in ads for General Mills&#x27; Frosty O&#x27;s cereal and Kendall &quot;Curad Comic Strips&quot; plastic bandages
* In the mid-1960s, the show promoted the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle Saving Stamp Club&quot; (at the time, the U.S. Post Office was directly under control of the federal government). Stamp albums of unused stamps could be exchanged for U.S. savings bonds, which paid interest. To date, Rocky and Bullwinkle have not appeared on any U.S. postage stamps.
* Rocky and Bullwinkle were in a 1986 television commercial for Hershey&#x27;s Kisses snack pack (this was Bill Scott&#x27;s final appearance as Bullwinkle before his death).
* In the 1990s, Rocky and Bullwinkle appeared in some ads for Taco Bell, wherein they ate real tacos by stopping Boris and Natasha from selling burgers.
* In 1993, Rocky and Bullwinkle appeared in an advertisement for their own vitamin soda pop which was in different colorful flavors including Bullwinkle’s favorite MooseBerry.
* In 1995, Boris and Natasha appeared in two Energizer batteries commercials, in which the spies are trying to stop the Energizer Bunny. Rocky and Bullwinkle also appeared in a commercial.
* In 1998, Rocky and Bullwinkle appeared in a commercial for Target Corporation where Boris and Natasha captured them and the two spies go shopping for a Black Friday sale.
* PDI/DreamWorks CGI versions of Rocky and Bullwinkle appeared in a 2014 advertisement for GEICO, appearing with the GEICO Gecko in the Rocky Mountains. June Foray reprised her role as Rocky for the commercial, while Tom Kenny voiced Bullwinkle.

===Children&#x27;s opera===
* In 1997, The Los Angeles Opera toured a children&#x27;s production, named &quot;Les Moose: The Operatic Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, around various L.A. County Elementary Schools. The story followed Boris and Natasha as they tried to steal the formula for Mooseberry Rocket Fuel from Bullwinkle J. Moose.

===Comics===
* A syndicated daily newspaper comic strip titled &quot;Bullwinkle&quot; began on July 23, 1962, with original stories drawn by Al Kilgore. It was syndicated by the Bell Syndicate and ended in 1965.
* Rocky and Bullwinkle stories were published in Four Color.
* Rocky and Bullwinkle comic books were published by Dell Comics, Gold Key Comics, Charlton Comics and Star Comics (an imprint of Marvel Comics). All were called &quot;Bullwinkle and Rocky&quot;. The comics, although for children, did contain numerous references spoofing issues such as celebrity worship or the politics of the 1980s. In one Star Comics issue, Bullwinkle owns a small company, which makes him eligible to compete in a fun run in Washington, D.C., for presidents of small companies. When Bullwinkle says he is there for the race, it is mistaken that he is campaigning for President. The comic also spoofed U.S. President Ronald Reagan, and he personally thanks Bullwinkle for stopping Boris and Natasha by rewarding him with monogrammed jelly beans. Another comic broke the fourth wall when the narrator is outraged at a plot of Boris&#x27;, to which Boris claims he has control of everyone &quot;by capturing the Marvel Comics building and tying up the editor&quot;. When the narrator comments on how this is morally wrong, Boris quiets him by saying, &quot;You will agree or you will not find paycheck in mail this month!&quot; The same issue made reference to the 1988 Olympics, which Boris had engineering in Fort Knox, Kentucky, in an attempt to steal its gold by carving all the bars into gold medals, as well as furnishing false information to every country so Pottsylvania would win all the gold medals (and thus take all true gold) by virtue of default. After Boris is foiled, the narrator comments that the games will go on as planned in real time in Seoul, South Korea.
* From 2013 to 2014, IDW Publishing with DreamWorks Classics and Bullwinkle Studios released comics of &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; and &quot;Peabody and Sherman&quot;.
* From 2017 to 2020, American Mythology Productions released comics of Rocky and Bullwinkle and it was written by Todd Livingston.

===Films===
* &quot;Boris and Natasha: The Movie&quot; (1992), is a live-action feature film starring the two villainous spies. Neither Rocky nor Bullwinkle appears in this film; however, the characters of Toots and Harve are identified as &quot;Moose&quot; and &quot;Squirrel&quot; at one point in the film. The film was originally intended for theatrical release, but was premiered on Showtime.

* &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; (2000) is a theatrical film starring Rocky and Bullwinkle. It was a mix of live-action with Rocky and Bullwinkle appearing as computer-animated cartoon characters created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic. June Foray returned to voice Rocky, while Bullwinkle was voiced by Keith Scott. Robert De Niro, Jason Alexander and Rene Russo played the live-action versions of Fearless Leader, Boris and Natasha, respectively. This film takes place 35 years after the show&#x27;s cancellation.

The short features Foray reprising Rocky and Tom Kenny as Bullwinkle.

===Music recordings===
* Golden Records released a phonograph album of songs, &quot;Rocky the Flying Squirrel &amp; His Friends&quot; (1961), using voice actors from the series. Boris and Natasha, for example, sing: &quot;We will double, single and triple cross our very closest friends!&quot;
* A 78 rpm single (Golden 659) was released on yellow vinyl. This had Rocky singing &quot;I Was Born To Be Airborne&quot; on one side, backed with Bullwinkle singing &quot;I&#x27;m Rocky&#x27;s Pal&quot;. The single sold in grocery stores. Paul Parnes (who later wrote songs for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;) is credited as composer. &quot;Some nutty characters get together here for the benefit of the very young. Lots of laughs for the juvenile sense of humor.&quot;
* The pseudonymously named Boris Badenough released a record called &quot;Hey Rocky!&quot; on Trax Records in 1986. The record featured a house-music beat underneath clips from the series.
* In 2007, Blackstone Audio released the audio tracks of 15 of the &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot; on CD.

===Toys===
* In 1999, Mattel released a numbered collector series under its Hot Wheels toy line, the &quot;Car-Toon Friends&quot; series. It contained four cars; the now-retired model &quot;XT-3&quot; for Rocky, &quot;Double Vision&quot; for Bullwinkle, &quot;Saltflat Racer&quot; for Natasha and &quot;Lakestar&quot; for Boris. They are no longer produced with these paint jobs and, as of December 2012, are hard to find.

* Data East released a pinball machine in 1993. Brazilian video game magazine &quot;Ação Games&quot; gave the pinball a fun rating 4 out of 4.

===Parodies, cameos and references===
* The Season 9 episode of Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;Simpson Tide&quot;, the opening couch gag is a recreation of the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; animated bumper seen at the end of each &quot;Bullwinkle&quot; short. The music accompanying it is also adapted from the original music in the bumper.
* Rocky and Bullwinkle made a brief cameo in the Comedy Central animated show &quot;Drawn Together&quot; in the episode &quot;Foxxy vs. the Board of Education&quot; when the hospital&#x27;s waiting room features cartoon cameos including Rocky getting stuck into Bullwinkle&#x27;s anus.
* In the animated series &quot;Arthur&quot;, the opening sequence of &quot;Do You Believe in Magic?&quot; parodies Bullwinkle attempting to pull a rabbit out of a magician&#x27;s hat. Arthur pulls a lion out by mistake and says &quot;Nothing up my sleeve...presto!&quot; However, unlike Bullwinkle, Arthur &quot;does&quot; manage to pull a rabbit out of a hat: Buster, who claims &quot;And now here&#x27;s something we hope you really like!&quot;, just like Rocky would.
* The season 3 &quot;Rugrats&quot; episode &quot;Sour Pickles&quot; features a flashback to Stu and Drew as babies watching &quot;Blocky and Oxwinkle&quot; with June Foray providing the voices of Blocky and Svetlana.
* In an episode of Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, in the &quot;Papercut to Aorta&quot; segment &quot;Of Moose and Squirrel&quot;, a cutout animated &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; spoof of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; has the duo playing George and Lennie, respectively, acting out some of the major moments of the story.
* A season 6 episode of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, called &quot;I See a Funny Cartoon in Your Future&quot;, is a homage to &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, lacking background music, the narrator talking constantly, pointing out the obvious and making puns, Madame Argentina (the antagonist of the episode) being voiced by June Foray and a cliffhanger with two different titles.
* Rocky and Bullwinkle made cameos in the background in the &quot;South Park&quot; trilogy &quot;&quot;. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have mentioned &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; as one of their biggest influences for &quot;South Park&quot;, primarily for its humor and satire.
* In the season 5 episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; titled &quot;Stanley S. SquarePants&quot;, a squirrel character who resembles Rocky made a cameo on a TV screen while SpongeBob&#x27;s cousin Stanley changes the channels but accidentally destroys the TV.
* &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; has been referenced several times in &quot;Family Guy&quot;.
** In the Season 3 episode &quot;The Thin White Line&quot;, Peter mistakes the tanning beds as time machines and accidentally pulls out a lion and Rocky (with June Foray reprising her role) shows up and says, &quot;And now, here&#x27;s something we hope you&#x27;ll really like&quot;, a frequent segue in the show.
** In the Season 3 episode &quot;The Kiss Seen Around the World&quot;, a cutaway shows that Peter and Brian travel back in time to meet Christopher Columbus in 1492, which parodied the &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot; segments.
** In the Season 7 episode &quot;Stew-Roids&quot;, after Stewie&#x27;s steroids injection wears off and leaves him with large arm-flaps of loose skin, he jumps out the bedroom window and flies like Rocky, landing on a mailbox with Rocky&#x27;s quote, &quot;And now here&#x27;s something we hope you&#x27;ll really like&quot;.
** In the Season 10 episode &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;, during Quahog&#x27;s annual Thanksgiving parade, Tom Tucker mentions the Rocky and Bullwinkle float while a car alarm interrupts his news reporting.
* In &quot;True Lies&quot;, Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) convinces Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) that she was going to be a spy and her contact&#x27;s name would be Boris. He went on to say that her name would be, and she interrupts to say &quot;Natasha?&quot; and is told, &quot;No, Doris&quot;. For the rest of the film, they are called Boris and Doris... This refers to and spoofs Rocky and Bullwinkle&#x27;s nemeses, Boris and Natasha.
* In the season 2 episode &quot;The Great Muppet Cartoon Show&quot; from the original 1984 &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, Gonzo imitates Rocky during the song &quot;We Love Cartoons&quot; and sings &quot;I&#x27;ll be a flying squirrel&quot;.
* In The CW show &quot;Supernatural&quot;, lead characters Sam and Dean are often called &quot;Moose&quot; and &quot;Squirrel&quot; respectively by the demon Crowley. In season 14 episode 10 &quot;Nihilism&quot;, Dean runs a bar called &quot;Rocky&#x27;s&quot; in a dream sequence, referencing his nickname of &quot;Squirrel&quot;.

<text>Katherine Swynford, Duchess of Lancaster (born Katherine de Roet, – 10 May 1403) was the third wife of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the fourth (but third surviving) son of King Edward III.

Daughter of a knight from Hainaut, Katherine, whose name is also spelled &#x27;Katharine&#x27; or &#x27;Catherine&#x27;, was brought up at the English royal court, later found herself in the service of Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt. At that time, she was married to Hugh Swynford (or de Swynford), one of the Duke&#x27;s knights. After the death of the Duchess, Katherine became the lady-in-waiting of her daughters, and also took care of them.

After the death of Hugh Swynford, she became a member of the household of the Duke&#x27;s new wife, Constance of Castile, and she was given management of the estates of her deceased husband in Lincolnshire: Coleby and Kettlethorpe. She soon became the mistress of John of Gaunt. From this connection, at least four children were born, who received the surname Beaufort after one of their father&#x27;s French estates. Those four children were later recognized and legitimized by the Church.

In addition, Gaunt gave his mistress several estates, and also provided her with a generous allowance. Since the relationship between Katherine and John of Gaunt caused public condemnation, in 1381 the Duke was forced to break their relationship. Katherine then settled in a rented house in Lincoln.

Despite the formal break, Katherine&#x27;s relationship with her former lover and the rest of his family continued to be quite cordial. In 1387, she was made a Lady of the Garter by King Richard II, and shortly thereafter she became a member of the household of Mary de Bohun, wife of Henry Bolingbroke, eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt, who later became King of England under the name of Henry IV.

In the early 1390s, the love affair between Katherine and John of Gaunt resumed, and after the death of his second wife, the Duke unexpectedly married his mistress in 1396, which caused discontent among the English nobility. However, in the same year, a papal bull was received, recognizing the marriage as valid, and all the children born from the connection were legitimised. After the death of the Duke in 1399, Katherine retired to her rented house in Lincoln, where she died four years later. She was buried at Lincoln Cathedral.

Katherine and John of Gaunt&#x27;s descendants, the Beaufort family, played a major role in the Wars of the Roses. Henry VII, who became King of England in 1485, derived his claim to the throne from his mother, Margaret Beaufort, who was a great-granddaughter of Gaunt and Swynford. His legal claim to the throne, therefore, was through a cognatic and previously illegitimate line. Henry VII&#x27;s first action was to declare himself king &quot;by right of conquest&quot; retroactively from 21 August 1485, the day before his army defeated King Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth. 

Through her son, John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, and her daughter, Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, Katherine became the ancestor of all English (and later British) kings since Edward IV.

==Family==
Katherine&#x27;s father was Paon de Roet, a herald and, later, knight (who was &quot;probably christened as Gilles&quot;), who came to England in the entourage of Philippa of Hainaut, who married King Edward III. Its origin is not documented. Payne&#x27;s family nickname was Roe (French: &quot;Roët&quot;). On this basis, it has been suggested that he was related to the powerful family of the Lords of Le Roeulx, who owned a lordship in the County of Hainaut, whose name was spelled differently: &quot;Rouet&quot;, &quot;Roëlt&quot;, &quot;Ruet&quot;. The origin of this genus has been traced back to Charlemagne. Their possessions were mainly concentrated around the city of Le Rœulx, located 8 miles northeast of Mons. They also included the towns of Roux (located 40 miles east of Mons) and Faurœulx (20 miles south). However, according to the historian Alison Weir, there is reason to doubt this version of Paon&#x27;s origin: the chronicler Jean Froissart, who himself was from Hainaut, was most likely well aware of his origin, but does not write anything about his nobility. As Paon&#x27;s father, he points to a certain Jean de Roët (died 1305), son of Huon de Roët. Froissart gives no titles for any of them. At the same time, Weir notes that this version cannot be completely discarded: Paon de Roet could indeed come from a younger line of the Le Roeulx family, since the spelling of the generic names Roeulx and Roët are quite similar and they could well be interchangeable. In addition, the name Gilles, which Paon received at baptism, was quite common in the family of the Lords of Le Roeulx.

Additional evidence of the possible relationship of Paon de Roet with the Lords of Le Roeulx is the heraldic similarity of the coats of arms of Paon and the Le Roeulx family. The coat of arms of the city of Le Rœulx is a golden lion on a green field with a wheel in its paw, which is a play on words: in French, &quot;roue&quot; means wheel. The same theme was adopted by Paon&#x27;s family: the coat of arms of his daughter, Katherine Swynford, was three gold wheels on a red field, however, judging by the heraldic emblems on the vestments given to her by Lincoln Cathedral, on her coat of arms until 1396, when she married John of Gaunt, there were three simple silver wheels; she probably inherited this coat of arms from her father.

Based on the description of his epitaph, Paon was King of Arms of Aquitaine for a time. In England, he was in the service of Queen Philippa. After the outbreak of the Hundred Years&#x27; War in 1340, he took part in the early stages of the English army, including fighting at the Battle of Crécy and the siege of Calais. Not later than 1349, Paon returned to Hainaut, where he served Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut, sister of Queen Philippa.

There is no reliable information regarding Katherine&#x27;s mother. According to some reports, Paon de Roet was married twice. It has been suggested that one of his wives was a relative of Queen Philippa, but there is no documentary evidence for this version. Alison Weir believes that two children were born from Paon&#x27;s first wife: the eldest daughter, Isabel (also called Elizabeth) —who later became in the Noble canoness of the very influential Saint Waltrude Collegiate Church in Mons (which, according to Weir, is evidence of Paon&#x27;s close connection with the ruling family of Hainaut)—, and a son, Walter. The mother of Katherine and another daughter, Philippa (who married the famous English poet Geoffrey Chaucer), was, according to Weir, Paon&#x27;s second wife.

==Life==
===Birth and early years===
Katherine&#x27;s year of birth is not documented. In 1631, John Weever claimed that she was the eldest of Paon de Roet&#x27;s daughters, but that would make her at least 28 years old at the time of her first marriage, which is much older than the typical age girls married. Alison Weir believes that Weever did not know about the existence of Elizabeth de Roet and the other two daughters. The author of the article of Katherine Swynford in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; believes that she was born around 1350, with which Weir agrees. They calculate the possible year of her birth based on the fact that Katherine married for the first time around 1362/1363 and gave birth to her first child around 1363/1364, and the canonical age at which a girl could marry and have marital relations with her husband, in that time was 12 years old. Weir further clarifies that Katherine was most likely born in 1349. She was probably named after St. Catherine of Alexandria whose cult at that time was gaining strength.

Katherine&#x27;s birthplace is sometimes called Picardy, with which Alison Weir does not agree. This error, in her opinion, arises from the fact that some historians confuse Philippa de Roet, Katherine&#x27;s sister, who was in the service of Queen Philippa, with certain Philippa Picard, but these are completely different personalities. Katherine was probably born in the County of Hainaut, as indicated by the account of the chronicler Jean Froissart, who calls her a &quot;resident&quot; from there, and the chronicler Henry Knighton, who calls her &quot;a certain foreigner&quot;. It is possible that Katherine&#x27;s birthplace was her father&#x27;s possessions, located near Mons.

In 1351, her father was in the service of Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut, whose position was rather precarious. In 1350 she renounced her claims to the Counties of Holland and Zeeland in favor of her second son, William, hoping to keep Hainaut under her rule. However, in the spring of 1351, William also captured Hainaut, Margaret II&#x27;s supporters were expelled, their castles were destroyed, and their positions were transferred to others. In December, Margaret II, hoping to enlist the support of her brother-in-law King Edward III, fled to England, among others Paon de Roet accompanied her. Given the uncertainty in Hainaut, he probably took his entire family with him —his wife (if she was still alive) and children, except for Elizabeth, who remained in her abbey.

Soon Margaret II agreed with her son. Under the terms of the agreement, Hainaut was returned to her. William himself arrived in England at the beginning of 1352, where he married Maud of Lancaster, a close relative of King Edward III. In March, Margaret II returned to Hainaut, accompanied by Paon de Roet. However, after August 1352, his references completely disappear from contemporary sources. Alison Weir believes that he died in early 1355, since it was then that his son Walter moved from the service of the Countess of Hainaut to the service of Edward the Black Prince, the eldest son and heir of King Edward III and Queen Philippa of Hainaut.

Paon de Roet&#x27;s daughters probably remained in England in the care of Queen Philippa, a &quot;noble and kind woman&quot;, who at that time was over 40 years old. She herself was the mother of 12 children, the youngest of which, Thomas of Woodstock, was born in 1355. In addition, she had several other children from noble families in her upbringing. The Queen was interested in literature and art, was engaged in charity work, &quot;she was a generous, kind, wise and humbly pious lady&quot;. Although many young girls were often sent to monasteries for education and training in good behavior and domestic skills, there is no evidence that Katherine was ever in a monastery. Her upbringing at the royal court is confirmed by Jean Froissart&#x27;s report, which indicates that she was brought up at princely courts from her youth, as well as a reference in John of Gaunt&#x27;s register to Katherine&#x27;s nurse named Agnes Bonsergent, who was most likely appointed by the Queen to care for the young girl. At the same time, the Queen knew Dutch and Anglo-Norman language, which was the official language of the English court at this time. It soon began to be supplanted by English, which began to be used at court in 1362, and in the English Parliament in 1363, and literary works began to be created in it. However, the Norman dialect of French continued to be used by the English nobility in everyday life and for letters until the beginning of the 15th century. Apparently, Katherine also learned English, since she was the mistress of the Kettlethorpe estate for a long time, and the husband of her sister Philippa was Geoffrey Chaucer, who wrote his works in English.

The older children of King Edward III and Queen Philippa were much older than Katherine, but she was probably brought up with their younger children, Mary and Margaret. Jean Froissart reports that Katherine&#x27;s tutor in her youth was Blanche of Lancaster, a close relative of the King and the bride of his third surviving son, John of Gaunt. At the same time, Blanche herself was brought up by Queen Philippa and was about 8 years older than Katherine. There is evidence that Katherine and Blanche of Lancaster were close friends. Apparently, the girl received a very good education, as evidenced by the fact that at the age of about 23 she was entrusted with the care of the daughters of Blanche of Lancaster, who grew up as highly cultured and educated girls. Although Katherine by origin did not belong to the highest nobility, her upbringing at the royal court opened up great prospects for her. In addition, probably through her upbringing, she acquired a certain piety and housekeeping skills, which in the future helped her effectively manage the knightly estates that were transferred to her. Also, she may have learned from the queen to be generous and diplomatic, which would come in handy later. Froissart reports that Katherine from her youth &quot;knew court etiquette perfectly&quot;, in addition, she was a fairly skilled rider, as evidenced by the fact that she kept a dozen of her horses in the stables of John of Gaunt, and also once accompanied him during a horse ride on his estates. Since her daughter, Joan Beaufort, and both daughters of Blanche of Lancaster, whom she raised, were literate, it seems that Katherine was literate and could read and possibly write.

===First marriage===
In the 1360s, Katherine was in the service of Blanche of Lancaster, who by that time had become the wife of John of Gaunt. Jean Froissart mentions that Katherine was in the service of Blanche&#x27;s family in her youth, but does not mention how old she was then. Gaunt&#x27;s wife had her own household, independent of her husband, which had its own staff of officers, servants and ladies. The first record of Katherine in this new capacity dates to 24 January 1365, when she is mentioned as a servant. However, John of Gaunt&#x27;s journals for an earlier period have not been preserved, and it is possible that her employment began at an earlier date. Blanche gave birth to her first daughter in March 1360, and she lived in the household of her mother-in-law, queen Phillipa, during her pregnancy. It is possible that Queen Philippa transferred Katherine to the service of Blanche at this time, and she probably accompanied Blanche to Leicester Castle for the confinement. Katherine&#x27;s duties would have been to help care for the newborn, possibly to rock the baby. Such work was often entrusted to young girls of the age of Katherine, who at that time was about 10 years old. 

At this time, Katherine herself married. This early marriage was probably arranged by John of Gaunt himself at the behest of his wife. Her first husband, Sir Hugh Swynford, descendant from an ancient English family, was a professional soldier and a tenant of the Duke of Lancaster. At first, he served the Black Prince, who probably knighted him. In 1361, he moved to the service of John of Gaunt, in the same year inheriting his ancestral domains after the death of his father. For a long time, it was believed that the marriage was concluded around 1366-1367; however, Alison Weir does not agree with this. Weir posits that Katherine&#x27;s eldest daughter in 1368 was old enough to be placed in the chambers of the daughters of the Duke of Lancaster. In addition, there are indications that another daughter was born in this marriage, who became a nun in 1377, and the earliest age at which this is possible was 13-14 years. On this basis, Weir considers that the marriage took place in 1361 or 1362. Katherine was definitely married by 24 January 1365 when, in the register of the Bishop of Lincoln, John Bokyngham, she is referred to as &quot;Katherine Swynford&quot;. The marriage may have been celebrated in one of the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s residences, possibly the chapel of Savoy Palace.

Although some researchers wrote that Katherine got married in an old aristocratic house, this is not true. Despite the fact that the Swynford family were quite an ancient and branched family, whose representatives had possessions in Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire, Essex and Suffolk, they were not aristocrats, but ordinary landowners, and never rose above the knightly rank. Hugh was not particularly rich, he owned only two estates in Lincolnshire —
Coleby and Kettlethorpe, and none of them were profitable enough, and they were acquired by his father relatively recently. His main income came from the salary for his service with the Duke of Lancaster.

Hugh lived mainly on the estate of Kettlethorpe, located 12 miles west of Lincoln, that became the main residence of Katherine for many subsequent years. For 40 years she was called &quot;Lady Kettlethorpe&quot;. The size of the estate was about 3,000 acres, most of which fell on the forest. It also included the villages of Lauterton, Newton-on-Trent and Fenton. Another Swynford estate, Colby, located seven miles south of Lincoln, was divided into two equal parts, each of which was about 90 acres of land and 15 acres of pasture. In 1367, the southern part of the estate generated an income of 54 shillings and 4d, with the rent paid to John of Gaunt as Earl of Richmond being 2 shillings. The other part of it belonged to the King and made up half of the knight&#x27;s fief. In 1361, it did not bring much income, since the land was barren, and the dovecote and mill lay in ruins; its cost was 37 shillings and 10 pence —a third of the amount once paid by Hugh&#x27;s father for its purchase.

Although Hugh Swynford was quite poor, he was able to receive a knighthood and provide his wife with a social position. It is not known how happy the marriage was, although, according to Alison Weir, it is unlikely that Katherine experienced warm or lasting feelings for her husband, due to her later connection with John of Gaunt. Hugh Swynford was often absent, participating in various military campaigns. When she married, Katherine became quite active in managing the estate of Kettlethorpe.

From her marriage, Katherine gave birth to several children. The eldest was probably a daughter, Blanche. In 1368 she was old enough to be placed in the chambers of the daughters of John of Gaunt, probably as a playmate. Alison Weir dates her birth to 1363. The origin of Blanche was recorded in 1396 by John of Gaunt, who, submitting a petition to the Pope for permission to marry Katherine, indicated that he was the godfather of her daughter, “born from another man”, adding that he did not advertise this fact. Some researchers have suggested that the Duke was the real father of Katherine&#x27;s daughter, and this was why he kept the fact that he was the godfather a secret. However, Weir pointed out that the real father could not be the godfather for his own daughter. At the same time, John of Gaunt himself directly indicated that he was not her father, and it is unlikely that he would lie to the Pope, putting himself at risk. Considering that he recognized four children born by Katherine from their love affair without any problems, there was no problem for him to recognize another daughter. Therefore, the father of the indicated daughter (by whom, apparently, Blanche was meant) was precisely Hugh Swynford. The girl was probably named after the Duke&#x27;s wife; she later enjoyed the patronage of Gaunt: in 1375 he granted Katherine custody of the heir Sir Robert Deincourt, who was betrothed to Blanche. Weir also suggested that Duchess Blanche herself could have been the godmother of Katherine&#x27;s daughter, which is why the girl could have been placed in her daughters&#x27; chambers.

The next daughter, Margaret, was born about 1364, and in 1377 she became a nun at Barking Abbey. Thomas Stapleton in 1846 also hypothesized that another daughter, Dorothy, who married Thomas Thymelby of Pulham near Horncastle (died 1390), Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1380, could have been born in this marriage. Although a number of researchers reject this statement, indicating that the name Dorothy was not used in England until the 16th century, however, Alison Weir indicates that there are cases of its use in medieval England, and the image of St. Dorothea of Caesarea, known in England since the time of the Anglo-Saxon conquest, is often found on stained-glass windows, especially at the end of the 14th-15th centuries. Weir admits that the unusual choice of name could be associated with her birth on the saint&#x27;s memorial day – 6 February. In addition, Weir points out that in the church at Irnham on the tombs and stained glass windows there are coats of arms of several prominent Lincolnshire families related by marriage, including Swynford and Thymelby. In her opinion, Dorothy could have been born around 1366. It is possible that other children who died in infancy could have been born in the marriage.

Like many other families in the service of John of Gaunt, Katherine and her husband often lived at the ducal court, and specially appointed officials managed their estates in their absence. At the same time, Hugh Swynford spent a significant part of his married life in various foreign military campaigns of the Duke in France and Spain. In particular, he participated in the military campaigns of 1366 and 1370. Most likely, Katherine continued to serve the Duchess between births, and her growing children could be brought up together with the children of the Ducal couple.

Katherine&#x27;s main duty at the ducal court was probably the care of the ducal children. Of the seven children born in the marriage of John of Gaunt and Blanche of Lancaster, only three survived to adulthood: two daughters, Philippa (later Queen consort of Portugal) and Elizabeth (by her three marriages Countess of Pembroke, Duchess of Exeter and Lady Cornwall), and one son, Henry Bolingbroke, who later became King of England under the name of Henry IV.

Shortly before 21 January 1365, John Bokyngham, Bishop of Lincoln, conferred on Katherine the privilege of privately church worship whenever she visited Leicester, which, according to Alison Weir, indicates that she was not only devout, but also a quite important and respected parishioner. In addition, to perform worship, she needed a chapel, a prayer house or a separate room, as well as a portable altar. However, Weir believes that it is unlikely that Katherine enjoyed such privilege in 1365.

In November 1366, Hugh Swynford traveled to Aquitaine to join John of Gaunt&#x27;s military expedition to Castile. Katherine, who was expecting a child, remained to serve Duchess Blanche, who was also pregnant. By Christmas, the Duchess had settled in her husband&#x27;s Bolingbroke Castle, where she gave birth to a son, Henry, in April. In mid-February 1367, Katherine moved to Lincoln, where on 24 February she gave birth to a son, Thomas. He was baptized at St. Margaret&#x27;s Church of Lincoln Cathedral and named after his paternal grandfather and one of his godparents, Canon Thomas Sutton.

Blanche of Lancaster, wife of John of Gaunt, died on 12 September 1368 at Tutbury Castle, Staffordshire. It is not known whether Katherine was present, but she, along with other ladies from the household of the late Duchess, accompanied the funeral cortege with her remains, who went south, and may have attended her funeral in London, at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The death of the Duchess of Lancaster brought about major changes in Katherine&#x27;s life. Usually, after the death of a noble lady, her household was dismissed. However, John of Gaunt had three small children to take care of. Katherine, who seemed to be highly regarded in the Duke&#x27;s household, got along well with the children. Therefore, it has been suggested that she remained in the nursery. Although there are statements that she was their governess at this point, Alison Weir indicates that other noble ladies performed these functions. In 1369, John of Gaunt appointed Alice FitzAlan, Lady Holland (cousin of the late Duchess) as the children&#x27;s governess, with a salary of £66 13s 4d per year. She performed these duties until November 1371. In addition, in 1370, the Duke granted Eileen, the wife of his squire Edward Herberge, a pension of £100 for &quot;the diligence and good service she has rendered to our dear daughter Philippa&quot;. Weir believes that Eileen Gerberge was a trusted lady who was present at the time of the Duchess&#x27;s death and was then appointed to look after Philippa. She was later assigned to the service of Gaunt&#x27;s second wife.

From 1368 until at least September 1369, Blanche Swynford, Katherine&#x27;s eldest daughter, lived in the ducal household as a lady-in-waiting to Philippa and Elizabeth, daughters of John of Gaunt. Since the registers of the Duke&#x27;s household for the years 1369–1372 have not been preserved, it is not known how long she remained in this capacity after 1369. There is no evidence that her mother lived at this time in the ducal house. Alison Weir suggests that Katherine, who had her own family, lived at that time in her estate of Kettlethorpe.

In August–September 1369, Hugh Swynford, as part of the army of John of Gaunt, participated in a military campaign in France, where the Hundred Years&#x27; War resumed; he returned to England probably in November. On 14 August of that year, Queen Philippa died. On 1 September, King Edward III ordered that mourning clothes be provided to his family and the servants of the late Queen. This included clothing for Blanche Swynford, &quot;damuselle of the daughters of the Duke of Lancaster&quot;, which, according to Weir, indicates that the Queen showed concern for Katherine and her family until the end of her life. It is likely that she, being a pupil of the Queen, was present on 29 January 1370 at her solemn funeral in Westminster Abbey, after which she returned to Kettlethorpe.

In 1370 Hugh Swynford again went on a military expedition with the Duke of Lancaster, this time to Aquitaine. When John of Gaunt, who had married Constance of Castile in the autumn of 1371, returned to England, Hugh no longer accompanied him. Probably due to illness, Katherine&#x27;s husband died in Aquitaine on 13 November 1371.

===Mistress of the Duke of Lancaster===
Katherine&#x27;s position after the death of her husband was not the best, since his financial condition was poor, and she had several small children to care for. But the Duke of Lancaster came to her aid. Although no documentary evidence of Katherine&#x27;s presence in the household of the new Duchess before March 1373 has survived, there are facts that, according to Alison Weir, indicate that John of Gaunt accepted Katherine into the service of his new wife, possibly in the same quality, as with the late Duchess Blanche. In the spring of 1372 John of Gaunt and the King helped her financially; and in the summer of the same year, Katherine was present at the birth of the first child by Duchess Constance, a daughter called Catherine. There is also documentary evidence that in the same year, Philippa Chaucer, Katherine&#x27;s sister, was in the service of the Duchess. In addition, the fact that it was Katherine who was chosen to inform the King about the birth of his new granddaughter speaks of the position she occupied.

The Duke&#x27;s new wife settled into Hertford Castle in early 1372, and Gaunt&#x27;s three children from his first marriage were also sent there. Katherine and her sister also resided there, becoming members of the Duchess Constance&#x27;s household. It can be assumed that Katherine&#x27;s duties included looking after the Duke&#x27;s children, who she knew well.

It is not established when exactly Katherine became John of Gaunt&#x27;s mistress. Jean Froissart wrote that the love affair began during the lifetime of Blanche of Lancaster and Hugh Swynford, but he sometimes made mistakes in his chronicle (in particular, he pointed out that Katherine gave birth to three children from John of Gaunt, although there were four of them). Therefore, according to Alison Weir, his testimony cannot be considered reliable, because the people who provided him with information could be wrong. Also, some later studies indicate that the love affair between Katherine and John of Gaunt began during the life of her first husband, and her eldest son Thomas Swynford was &quot;a child from two fathers&quot;, but this seems unlikely to modern researchers. In the document of the grant of an annuity to Katherine Swynford by King Richard II dated 7 June 1392, it is indicated that her first-born son with the Duke of Lancaster, John Beaufort, was 21 years old. Based on this, he must have been born between June 1371 and June 1372. However, Alison Weir doubts that he could have been born at this time, as from June 1370 to November 1371 the Duke was in Aquitaine, where in September 1371 he married Constance of Castile. Although it is possible that Katherine could have joined her husband in Aquitaine, Weir considers this unlikely as wives rarely accompanied their husbands to war. In addition, someone had to manage the estates in England and take care of small children during Gaunt&#x27;s absence. In a petition to the Pope dated 1 September 1396, John of Gaunt indicates that the affair began when he was married to Constance of Castile, and Katherine was free from marriage. Therefore the affair, according to him, began after the death of Katherine&#x27;s husband. Based on this, Weir concludes that most likely the love affair began in the late autumn of 1372, when there was a significant increase in Katherine&#x27;s social status in the Lancastrian household.

Due to Hugh Swynford&#x27;s heir, Thomas, being a minor at the time of his father&#x27;s death, the family estates usually passed into the custody of the overlord, in this case the King and Duke of Lancaster. However, they quickly took measures to improve the financial situation of Hugh&#x27;s widow, which was unusual for that time, and was explained, apparently, because the affair between Katherine and John of Gaunt had already begun. The first documentary evidence is a gift of £10 made by the Duke at the Savoy Palace on 1 May 1372 &quot;to our very dear damoiselle Katherine de Swynford&quot;. On 15 May, he generously increased her annuity from the Duchy of Lancaster from 20 to 50 marks &quot;for the good and pleasant services she rendered to our dear companion [Blanche] ... and for the very great love which our companion rendered to Katherine.&quot; On 8 June King Edward III, probably at the suggestion of his son, ordered his escheator to transfer her widow&#x27;s share to Katherine, provided that she would give her word not to remarry without the consent of the King; she entered into her possession on 26 June, when she took the oath, and on 20 June, the Duke gave her custody of all the possessions that her son was supposed to inherit. As a result, Katherine, until her son attained his legal majority of age, received the management of the estate of Kettlethorpe, as well as a third of the estate of Colby.

The inquisition post mortem for the succession of Hugh Swynford took place on 24 June in Lincolnshire and 25 July 1372 at Navenby. As a result, Thomas Swynford was recognized as his father&#x27;s heir, but it was noted that the estates of Kettlethorpe and Colby were in poor condition and were worth almost nothing. The King and the Duke of Lancaster again came to the aid of Katherine. As a result, on 12 September, in exchange for £20, which she had to pay to the treasury, Katherine was given the remaining 2/3 of the Colby estate, as well as the right to arrange the marriage of her son Thomas.

Katherine most probably attended Duchess Constance at the birth of her daughter on 31 March 1373, as she conveyed the news of this birth to King Edward III, for which he awarded her 20 marks. This happened, according to Alison Weir, in the summer of 1372. However, after her own pregnancy became apparent, Katherine most likely returned to Kettlethorpe.

Between 1373 and 1381, Katherine bore at least four children to the Duke of Lancaster: three sons and a daughter. The dates of their births are not mentioned in the documents, however, the researchers calculated the possible years of birth based on indirect data. The eldest of these was John, who was probably born in the winter of 1372–1373. Alison Weir believes that Katherine&#x27;s eldest son from her affair may have been the child for whose baptism rich cloths were sent to Lincoln in February 1373. He received his name in honor of his father, and also received the surname Beaufort (which was worn by the rest of the children of Katherine and John of Gaunt). It is not known exactly why such a surname was chosen. According to one version, it is associated with the Beaufort Castle in Champagne, which went to the duke as part of the Lancastrian inheritance. However, it is possible that this could have been a compliment to Roger de Beaufort, brother of Pope Gregory XI, who was a prisoner of Gaunt in the 1370s and with whom he later maintained close diplomatic contacts. Old studies claimed that all of Katherine&#x27;s children were born in Beaufort Castle, but this information is false: John of Gaunt never visited it, and in 1369 he sold the domain. According to Weir, John was most likely born in Lincoln, and his childhood years were spent in Kettlethorpe, since John of Gaunt tried not to advertise the affair with Katherine.

By 31 March 1373, Katherine returned to Savoy Palace, where John of Gaunt lived at that time. Henry Knighton, writing his chronicle after 1378, indicates that Katherine served in the household of Duchess Constance, but none of the Duke&#x27;s grants made to his mistress during this period state that they were given for service to his wife. Although Katherine appears to have occasionally visited the Duchess, she was not her lady-in-waiting. John of Gaunt found another post for her, appointing her mistress as the governess to Philippa and Elizabeth, his daughters from his first marriage. It is possible that Katherine also took care of his son Henry for some time, until another tutor was appointed to him in 1374. The exact date of Katherine&#x27;s appointment to this position is unknown. In 1368–1372, the daughters of John of Gaunt, judging by the surviving news, had other governesses. Alison Weir believes that the appointment took place in the spring of 1373 —after the birth of Katherine&#x27;s son John Beaufort. She had enough skills to care for children. In addition to her own, Katherine apparently helped in the care of the ducal children during the life of Duchess Blanche. Although the position itself was essentially a ploy so that the Duke could see his mistress, there is evidence that Katherine spent quite a lot of time with the Duke&#x27;s daughters. Having received official status, she received a legitimate reason for living in the ducal household.

It is likely that by 1373, the Castilian ladies of his wife knew that the Duke had a mistress, as a result of which, angry because of their gossip, John of Gaunt sent them to Nuneaton Priory. By the end of 1374 the ladies, weary of the monastic regime, begged to be allowed to leave Nuneaton, but their request was only granted in 1375, when the Duke allowed them to settle in Leicester with some of his trusted vassals. He later arranged marriages for some of the ladies. Apparently, Duchess Constance also knew about her husband&#x27;s affair, but for her the return of the Castilian throne was much more important.

In the summer of 1373, John of Gaunt was preparing for a new military expedition to France. There is evidence that Katherine at that time visited the Duke at the Northbourn estate, where she was from 27 June to 16 July. Most likely, there she complained to John of Gaunt that her allowance was not paid on time; as a result, on 27 June he wrote an angry letter to John de Stafford ordering that the annuity promised to her be paid without delay to &quot;the dear and beloved Madame Katherine de Swynford&quot;. It is probable that after this she returned to Kettlethorpe, since the Duke promised to send her venison and firewood there. She later moved to Tutbury Castle, where John&#x27;s wife and four legitimate children were to live during his absence from England.

On 12 September 1374, Katherine may have been present, along with John of Gaunt, who had returned from France, at a memorial ceremony in honor of the late Duchess Blanche, held at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, although there is no documentary evidence of this. On 26 September, the duke, while at Savenby, ordered John de Stafford to pay Katherine a gift of £25. By 1376, she was in charge of the household of Gaunt&#x27;s daughters, who were also given their own rooms and wardrobes.

Katherine probably celebrated Christmas of 1375 with John of Gaunt at Eltham Palace, and on 1 January 1376 the Duke granted his mistress the lucrative wardship of the heir Sir Robert Deincourt, and the right to marry him with Blanche Swynford, Katherine&#x27;s eldest daughter from her first marriage, who was approaching the marriageable age of 12 years. It is likely that John of Gaunt planned the marriage of Blanche with the young heir, but there was no evidence of her future fate, from which Alison Weir concluded that Blanche Swynford died young, before the wedding took place. Robert himself, having become an adult, in the years 1387–1392 requested his inheritance. On 2 January the Duke, who went to Hertford Castle, instructed to pay Katherine 1 mark, and also appointed her an annual annuity of 50 marks, possibly due to the fact that she was again pregnant. On 14 January John of Gaunt ordered that a barrel of the best Gascon wine be sent to Katherine, who had returned to Kettlethorpe.

Katherine spent the summer of 1375 in Kenilworth and at that time, according to Alison Weir, she gave birth to her second son from John of Gaunt. She probably went to Lincoln to give birth, since in August the Duke ordered that the local midwife be rewarded. Also on 24 July, John of Gaunt ordered that 60 oak trees be sent to Kettlethorpe to renovate Katherine&#x27;s estate. In the same year, she was paid 100 marks. Also, according to the order of the Duke, which may date back to 1375 or 1377, Katherine was presented with tenement houses on the east bank of the River Witham in the Lincolnshire port of Boston, formerly owned by Geoffrey de Sutton. These included the estate of Gisors Hall, which included a house with two hectares of land, a garden and outbuildings, which was allocated by John of Gaunt from the County of Richmond until 1372. Later Gisors Hall was bequeathed by Katherine to her son Thomas Beaufort.

The second son of Katherine and John of Gaunt seems to have been Henry Beaufort, who was named probably after Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Although it has been hypothesized that the future Cardinal was the youngest of Katherine&#x27;s sons, since in 1398 he was called a &quot;boy&quot; when he was appointed Bishop of Lincoln, but, according to Alison Weir, this epithet was simply a derisive comment on Henry&#x27;s elevation to the bishopric at the age of 23. The 17th-century genealogist Francis Sanford lists the Cardinal as the second son, and he is also listed second in the Beaufort list of the Papal bull for their legitimization of 1397.

In August 1375, Katherine accompanied John of Gaunt on his trip to Leicester. It is possible that it was then that the mayor of Leicester, William Ferrour, spent 16 shillings to present wine as a gift to &quot;Lady Katherine Swynford, mistress of the Duke of Lancaster&quot;. The record of this payment is dated 1375–1376 and is the first documentary evidence that John of Gaunt&#x27;s love affair became public. Anthony Goodman suggests that this news indicates that Katherine usurped the rightful place of the Duchess of Lancaster, but Alison Weir does not agree with this; according to her, Katherine avoided involvement in politics and tried to keep a low profile, since very few cases are known when she used her position. In addition, she apparently maintained her status as a widow. In September, Katherine returned to Kettlethorpe.

On 25 July 1376, John of Gaunt granted Katherine Swynford, who was probably again pregnant, custody and right of marriage over Bertram de Soneby&#x27;s heiress. By 1376–1377 is the first recorded payment for the cost of the wardrobe and chambers of Philippa of Lancaster in the amount of £50, paid to Katherine. Also by order of the Duke, she was to be paid £100 in equal installments at Easter and St. Michael&#x27;s to cover expenses for which she was to account. It is probable that during the meeting of the Good Parliament and the turbulent events that followed, Katherine took care of John of Gaunt&#x27;s daughters, possibly living in the Savoy Palace.

It is likely that John of Gaunt&#x27;s legitimate children perceived his illegitimate children as brothers and sisters, possibly including Katherine&#x27;s children from her first marriage in the family circle. According to the surviving information, Katherine and John were good and caring parents. So the &quot;Anonymous Chronicle&quot; reports that Katherine &quot;loved the Duke of Lancaster and the children born from him&quot;.

In 1376, at the request of Gaunt, the Pope granted Katherine permission to have a portable altar in her residence in the Diocese of Lincoln.

At the end of 1376, Katherine disappears from the sources; it is likely that this is due to the birth of her third child by John of Gaunt, which occurred in early 1377. Perhaps that is why on 25 February 1377, the King allowed his son to give his mistress the estates of Gringley and Whitley (Nottinghamshire), which brought an annual income of £150. Also, the Duke at the same time sent Katherine a barrel of wine as a gift. Sydney Armitage-Smith, author of a study on John of Gaunt, suggested that Thomas Beaufort, the youngest of the sons of John of Gaunt and Katherine, was born in early 1377, but Alison Weir believes that, most likely, their only daughter Joan Beaufort was born then. She was probably named in honor of the Dowager Princess of Wales, Joan of Kent. The child&#x27;s birthplace may have been Kettlethorpe, but it is possible that both Joan and Thomas were born at Pleshey Castle in Essex. Anthony Goodman, who adhered to the traditional date of Joan&#x27;s birth (1379), believed that since John of Gaunt was hated in England, and anyone who was dear to him was at risk, Katherine was taken to Pleshey Castle, which at that time belonged to Joan Fitzalan, Dowager Countess of Hereford. She was a close relative of the Duke&#x27;s first wife through her mother. In addition, in 1376 her daughter Eleanor de Bohun married Thomas of Woodstock, John of Gaunt&#x27;s younger brother. In favor of this birthplace of Katherine&#x27;s younger children, the fact that Joan Fitzalan was the godmother of Thomas Beaufort, and later he was taken into the house of the Countess&#x27;s youngest daughter, Mary de Bohun (later wife of Henry Bolingbroke, John of Gaunt&#x27;s only surviving legitimate son), testifies in favor of this place of birth. Alison Weir also adheres to the same version of Joan&#x27;s birthplace. Historians suggest that Katherine and John of Gaunt may have had other children who did not survive infancy.

After receiving Gringley (located 12 miles northwest of Kettlethorpe) and Wheatley (3 miles south of Greenley and 9 miles northwest of Kettlethorpe), which the King confirmed on 4 March 1377, Katherine became a reasonably wealthy woman. In addition, in the same year, John of Gaunt granted her two more estates in Lincolnshire – Waddington (5 miles south of Lincoln) and Wellingore (12 miles south of Lincoln).

===Formal break with John of Gaunt===
In June 1377, King Edward III died. It is possible that Katherine, who was the governess of the late monarch&#x27;s granddaughters, was in London during this period, but it is unlikely that she often saw the Duke busy preparing for the coronation of his infant nephew and new King Richard II. Although John of Gaunt was not officially a member of the regency council, but among his 12 lords there were 5 of his supporters, so he could influence decisions. Already on 20 July, the young King confirmed the grant to Katherine Swynford of the Gringley and Wheatley estates, and on 24 July the Duke again presented her with oaks for the repair of Kettlethorpe.

The first public appearance of John of Gaunt with Katherine Swynford, which made their affair explicit, is in March 1378. Thomas Walsingham wrote in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; that the Duke, &quot;casting aside every shame of man and the fear of God, allowed himself to be seen riding through the Duchy with his concubine, a certain Katherine Swynford&quot;. Further, the chronicler reports that the people were indignant and despaired because of such scandalous behavior. In his opinion, it was because of Katherine, whom he called &quot;a witch and a whore&quot;, that &quot;the most terrible curses and vile insults began to circulate against the Duke&quot;. Walsingham&#x27;s account is the first mention of the name of the Duke&#x27;s mistress in chronicles. In the future, a negative attitude towards Katherine is also found in the messages of some other chroniclers. Even Henry Knighton, pro-Lancastrian, did not approve of Gaunt&#x27;s mistress: &quot;a certain foreigner Katherine Swynford lived in his wife&#x27;s house, whose relationship with him was very suspicious&quot;. In addition, the chronicler points out that the love affair disturbed members of the Duke&#x27;s family, who feared its consequences. John of Gaunt himself in 1381 said that clerics and servants repeatedly warned him about the detrimental effect of his connection with Katherine on his reputation, but he ignored them.

In April 1378, Katherine probably returned to Kettlethorpe, where she received occasional visits from the Duke. In addition, during this period, her sister, Philippa Chaucer, settled on the estate. In later years, Katherine seems to have used some of her income to buy small plots of land in nearby villages, expanding her holdings in Kettlethorpe and Colby.

On 20 January 1381, the Duke gave Katherine the custody of the lands and wardship of the heiress of the late Alice de Thorsby, a member of his household. These properties were located about twelve miles west of Kettlethorpe. In return, she was to provide all the services &quot;due and customary&quot;. However, the next day this condition about services was removed. According to Alison Weir, this award is connected with the birth this month of their last known child, Thomas Beaufort.

John of Gaunt&#x27;s love affair with Katherine Swynford caused public condemnation. Modern chroniclers, who called him a bigamist, condemned the fact that the income of the Duke&#x27;s mistress was greater than that of his wife. Walsingham relates that after the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, the Duke &quot;blamed himself for the death of [those] who had been overthrown by unholy violence&quot; and &quot;reproached himself for his connection with Katherine Swynford, or rather forswearing her&quot;. As a result, in July, John of Gaunt was forced to officially announce his intention to part with his mistress and reconcile with his wife. Katherine resigned her position as governess and left the Lancaster household in September, receiving an annuity of £200. She settled in Lincoln, renting for 50 shillings per year a house in Minster Yard formerly occupied by the Chancellors of Lincoln Cathedral. She remained in this residence until at least 1393.

===Lady Kettlethorpe===
However, the break was only formal. Katherine&#x27;s relationship with John of Gaunt and the rest of his family continued to be quite cordial. In 1382 she and her daughter Joan Beaufort visited Mary de Bohun, the wife of Henry Bolingbroke, who was expecting a child. The Duke continued to provide for her and their children, and when John of Gaunt himself needed money, Katherine lent him money, for example in 1386, when she helped the Duke to finance his Castilian expedition. In 1387 she received a New Year&#x27;s gift from Mary de Bohun. In the early 1390s, she often visited the court of John of Gaunt, where a stable and a dozen horses were allocated for her convenience. In addition, in 1382, the Duke placed Thomas Swynford, Katherine&#x27;s son from her first marriage, in the retinue of Henry Bolingbroke. At the same time, apparently, until at least 1389, John of Gaunt kept his promise and did not enter into a love relationship with his former mistress, especially since during this period he was mostly outside of England.

On 20 October 1383 King Richard II, who apparently sympathized with Katherine, granted her the right to fence 300 acres of land and forest on the estate of Kettlethorpe, and in April 1387, he made her a Lady of the Order of the Garter, which during this period was considered the highest honor an Englishwoman could receive. According to Alison Weir, this was a tacit recognition of Katherine&#x27;s special relationship with John of Gaunt. In addition, it is possible that in this way the King tried to enlist the support of his uncle against the opposition that existed at court, dissatisfied with the sovereign&#x27;s dependence on favorites. In August 1388 a new set of clothing made of scarlet wool was paid for by the King for Katherine, and in the same year she arrived at Windsor Castle to participate, along with 10 other ladies of the Order, in a large feast hosted by King Richard II on St. George&#x27;s Day.

On Christmas Day of 1387, Katherine agreed, along with her daughter Joan Beaufort, to become part of the household of Mary de Bohun. As a result, she took a place of honor in the royal court. It is likely that her duties included looking after their rapidly growing family, starting with the infant Henry of Monmouth (future King Henry V).

In November 1389, John of Gaunt returned to England after a three-year absence. Although there are no records of Katherine during this period, and she herself seems to have spent most of her time in Lincolnshire, there is much evidence that the Duke at this time began to plan for the future of his illegitimate children. The second son, Henry Beaufort, destined for the service of the church, began to receive church benefices from January 1390. The eldest son, John Beaufort, who &quot;was a great favorite of his father&quot;, in the spring of 1390 took part in a large jousting tournament at Saint-Inglevert near Calais, after which he began to participate in military campaigns. Also in December 1390, the King authorized the Duke to grant a number of estates in Northamptonshire to John Beaufort. Around 1392, John of Gaunt arranged the marriage of his daughter Joan Beaufort to Robert Ferrers of Wem, and before 28 September 1397 the Duke also orchestrated the wedding of John Beaufort with Margaret Holland, uterine niece of King Richard II.

Apparently, in 1391, relations between Katherine and John of Gaunt resumed, after which she again began to occupy an important place in his life. It is possible that they received this opportunity due to the fact that at that time the Duke&#x27;s wife began to live separately from her husband. However, during this period, Katherine did not live permanently with Gaunt, continuing at least until 1393 to rent a house in Lincoln. It is possible that they again became lovers, but at the same time they tried to behave cautiously.

===Duchess of Lancaster===
On 24 March 1394, Constance of Castile, 2nd wife of John of Gaunt, died. Apparently, after that, the Duke decided to marry Katherine. In addition to the feelings that he had for his long-term mistress, most likely, in this way he also wanted to legitimize his children.

Although Thomas Walsingham argued that the planned marriage came as a surprise to the King, Alison Weir notes that this is unlikely. The marriage itself took place at Lincoln Cathedral on 13 January 1396. After that, Katherine became the Duchess of Lancaster and for some time the first lady of the Kingdom, since the first wife of King Richard II had died by that time, and he entered into a second marriage in November. To emphasize her status and smooth out memories of the past, she made her coat of arms instead of the silver rings depicted on the coat of arms of de Roet family, the three wheels of St. Catherine –her patroness, who was associated with royalty and virtue. After the wedding, the ducal couple made a short trip to the north, after which, by 23 January, they settled for some time in Pontefract Castle.

This marriage caused alarm at the royal court and general disapproval, for it was considered a &quot;mésalliance&quot;. For the first time in her new status, Katherine apparently appeared at court in April 1396 at the celebration of St. George&#x27;s Day. John of Gaunt&#x27;s brother, Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, and his wife, Eleanor de Bohun, were most outraged. At the same time, the ducal couple did not have any document allowing the marriage –only the oral permission of the Pope, so there were fears that the marriage could be challenged and annulled. Therefore, the Duke wrote to the Pope, asking for apostolic permission. In anticipation, the couple settled in Ely Place in London. On 16 May John of Gaunt appointed £600 per year for the maintenance of his wife. In addition, the new Duchess had her own wardrobe and household.

On 1 September 1396 Pope Boniface IX declared the marriage of John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford as valid by a bull. In addition, he legitimized their children born before marriage –the Beauforts. This news seems to have reached England before 7 October, when the ducal couple sailed from England to Calais, where a lavish ceremony took place on 4 November, as a result of which King Richard II married Princess Isabella of France, daughter of King Charles VI. According to Jean Froissart, it was Katherine who until the end of the summer &quot;was the companion of the young Queen of England&quot;, probably becoming her companion immediately after the marriage. The King, Queen and their retinue returned to England on 12 November and the next day they solemnly entered London.

The legitimization of the Beauforts had a beneficial effect on their later careers. In addition, shortly after the return of John of Gaunt and Katherine to England, their widowed daughter, Joan Beaufort, was married to Ralph Neville, 4th Baron Neville de Raby, a powerful northern noblemen. In February 1397, King Richard II confirmed the Beauforts&#x27; legitimation by a decree during a meeting of the English Parliament. In addition, on 10 February John Beaufort received the title of Earl of Somerset, and the next day, the King approved joint ownership of John of Gaunt and his wife for estates in Yorkshire, Norfolk and Sussex, which the Duke received in 1372 in exchange for the Earldom of Richmond. Katherine retained control over them even after the death of her husband. Also, a number of awards were made to the youngest son, Thomas Beaufort, and Henry Beaufort became a Deacon and Chancellor of Oxford University.

During the first 18 months of their marriage, Katherine was often at court, where she held a prominent position. However, little is known about how she lived in the subsequent period until the death of her husband.

John of Gaunt&#x27;s health declined in the last years of his life. In addition, his heir, Henry Bolingbroke, was on bad terms with King Richard II, and in September 1398 he was expelled from England by royal order, which, by all accounts, aggravated the Duke&#x27;s illness. Its nature is unknown, but it has been suggested that the John of Gaunt had some kind of venereal disease. If this suspicion is correct, then, as Alison Weir points out, it is possible that Katherine could also have been infected with it.

On 3 February 1399, John of Gaunt, who lived at Leicester Castle, made a detailed will: according to him, furniture, jewelry and rich clothes were left to his wife. He died on the same day.

===Last years===
Immediately after the death of the Duke, the royal escheators unlawfully took into custody all the possessions belonging to Katherine, as well as the Lancaster estates. As a result, she had to make a request to King Richard II, who on 9 March 1399 ordered the estates to be returned. Also, the sovereign confirmed to the Dowager Duchess the annual annuity of £1,000, levied on the lands of the Duchy of Lancaster, which her husband assigned to her. At the same time, on 18 March, without any legal pretext, the King announced that he was replacing the 10-year exile of Henry Bolingbroke with a life sentence, and would confiscate those possessions that he was supposed to inherit. Although King Richard II did not grieve very much about the death of his uncle, he allowed Katherine to keep the lands she received as a dowry, and in May, when his royal escheators seized the lands that belonged to her before her marriage, he ordered them to be returned. After that, the Dowager Duchess tried to keep aloof and did not protest against the confiscation of the Lancastrian inheritance. Not wanting to live on one of her estates, Katherine left for Lincoln. She passed custody of Kettlethorpe and Colby to her son, Thomas Swynford, and for housing she rented a house in Minster Yard, which she rented until her death.

There are few references to Katherine in the last years of her life. In the autumn of 1399, Henry Bolingbroke invaded England and deposed King Richard II, crowned himself as Henry IV. Katherine&#x27;s children, the Beauforts and Thomas Swynford, and her son-in-law Ralph Neville supported the usurpation of the throne. The new king officially began to call his stepmother &quot;the Mother of the King.&quot; However, apparently, Katherine led a quiet life in Lincoln, not taking any part in the political life of the Kingdom.

On 12 February 1400, King Henry IV granted Katherine the estate of Laughton en le Morthen near Tickhill in Yorkshire. Around this time he also gave her £200 per year from the lands of Huntingdonshire and an annual income of 700 marks from the estate of Lincolnshire, and confirmed the annuity of £1,000 assigned to her by his father. As a result, she became quite a rich woman. It is also known that Katherine owned houses in Lincoln, Boston, Grantham and King&#x27;s Lynn and had business dealings with merchants from some of these cities. It is possible that the Dowager Duchess had long-standing commercial interests in the wool trade, as it is known that she had property inherited from her father in Hainaut, a major center for the wool trade. Alison Weir believes that, perhaps, by investing money in such enterprises, Katherine tried to expand the Swynford inheritance.

===Death and burial===
Katherine Swynford died on 10 May 1403 at Lincoln. She was buried at Lincoln Cathedral in the choir of angels. The chest of her tombstone was made of Purbeck marble, had a stucco plinth and a lid. Heraldic shields surrounded by garters were depicted on it. The tombstone was crowned with a brass canopy, on which Katherine herself was depicted in a widow&#x27;s wimple, and above it rose a vaulted canopy with trefoil arches. Francis Thynne, a Lancastrian antiquary and officer of arms at the College of Arms, about 1600 copied an epitaph which said: “Here lies Lady Katherine, Duchess of Lancaster, wife of the very noble and very gracious Prince John, Duke of Lancaster, son of the very noble King Edward III, who died 10 May in the year of grace 1403, whose soul God will have mercy and pity. Amen&quot;.

Her daughter, Joan Beaufort, was buried next to her mother. In her will, she requested that her mother&#x27;s burial site be expanded and enclosed, if the Dean and Chapter would not object. Three years before her death (28 November 1437) Joan received permission from King Henry VI to establish a chapel with two chaplains to serve daily at the altar in front of her mother&#x27;s grave. She was also allowed to use the &quot;advowson&quot; (patronage) of Welton Church in Howdenshire, formerly owned by Durham Priory, but transferred to the Neville family in the 1380s. It is likely that the new chapel was to replace the one founded at Lincoln Cathedral by John of Gaunt in 1398, however it is unknown if this was done. It has not been determined whether the surviving tomb was built after the death in 1403 of Katherine Swynford or after Joan Beaufort&#x27;s death in 1440; given that Joan&#x27;s will expressed a desire to enclose her mother&#x27;s grave, it is most likely that the wrought iron screen was created around 1440. Originally, Joan&#x27;s remains were located side by side with her mother.

The chapel existed until the middle of the 16th century, services in it were abolished during the reign of King Edward VI. Her possessions, valued at £13.6 and 6 pence, included two bowls, two silver vessels (for holding Holy water and Eucharist wine), a silver Pax and a silver bell. The burials of Joan Beaufort and Katherine Swynford, standing side by side, were described at the beginning of the 16th century by the royal antiquarian John Leland. Around 1640, William Dugdale carefully sketched the graves.

In 1644, during the English Civil War, both burials were partially destroyed by the Roundheads during the sacking of Lincoln Cathedral. As a result, copper images and tablets were torn off, and the masonry of the chapel was badly damaged. By 1672, the tomb boxes were in their present position, and the canopy was clumsily restored. In the 19th century, a &quot;Gothic&quot; restoration of monuments was planned, but it was eventually abandoned. Although there are claims that the tombs are now empty and that the remains of Katherine and Joan were pulled out by the Roundheads, they are most likely unsubstantiated, as there is no evidence that the bodies were disturbed. They are probably still under the floor of the tomb.

Currently, both burials stand close to each other with a short side. Katherine&#x27;s tomb has indentations showing where armorial shields were previously located. From the chapel, which once housed the tombs, only a carefully restored canopy, east and west pilasters and a wrought iron grating on a pedestal have survived.

==Aftermath==
After the ascension to the English throne of John of Gaunt&#x27;s heir Henry IV, Katherine Swynford&#x27;s children from John of Gaunt played a prominent role in English politics. On 9 February 1407, the King confirmed the legitimation of his half-sibilings the Beauforts, but specifically stipulated by a clause (&#x27;excepta dignitate regali&#x27;) that they did not have any rights to the English throne, although modern scholarship disputes the authority of a monarch to alter an existing parliamentary statute on his own authority, without the further approval of Parliament. 

Katherine&#x27;s granddaughter, Cecily Neville (daughter of Joan Beaufort and her second husband Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland), became the wife of Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York; from this marriage were born, among others, Kings Edward IV and Richard III. Another granddaughter, Joan Beaufort (daughter of John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset) married King James I of Scotland and became the ancestor of the succeeding Scottish monarchs from the House of Stuart. Another descendant of Katherine, Margaret Beaufort (granddaughter of John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset), became the mother of King Henry VII, the progenitor of the House of Tudor. He justified his right to the throne precisely by his descent from the House of Beaufort. In consequence, Katherine Swynford became in the direct ancestor of all subsequent Kings and Queens of England (and then Great Britain).

The Beauforts themselves played a prominent role during the Wars of the Roses. Although after the death in 1471 of Edmund Beaufort, styled 4th Duke of Somerset, the family died out in the male line, but a side branch remained, the ancestor of which was Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, the illegitimate son of Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset. It still exists today, with the head being the Duke of Beaufort, created in 1682 by King Charles II in recognition of his &quot;most conspicuous descent from King Edward III by John Beaufort, eldest son of John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford&quot;.

Thomas [II] Swynford, Katherine&#x27;s son from her first marriage, made a career at the court of King Henry IV, who made him a number of awards. In late 1399 – early 1400, he was one of the jailers of the deposed King Richard II at Pontefract Castle and, according to the chronicler Adam of Usk, was the main culprit in his death, starving him to death. In 1406, Thomas [II] entered the service of his half-brother Thomas Beaufort. In 1411 he tried to obtain his maternal grandfather&#x27;s estate in Hainaut, but it is not known whether his efforts were successful. Towards the end of his life, Thomas [II] was forced to hand over his estates to trustees and died virtually landless on 2 April 1432. His heir, Thomas [III] Swynford, survived his father for a few years and died in 1440, leaving an underage son, Thomas [IV] (1435 – 3 May 1498). In 1468, he gave Kettlethorpe and Colby to his uncle William Swynford, who died no later than 1483, after which the estates returned to Thomas [IV]. He died without heirs in 1498, and with him the male line of descendants of Hugh Swynford and Katherine died out. The Swynford ancestral domains of Kettlethorpe and Colby were eventually inherited by the descendants of Margaret Swynford, sister of Thomas [IV], by her marriage to Thomas Pouncefot.

Katherine&#x27;s older brother, Walter de Roet (born no later than 1338–1340), since May 1355 was in the service of Edward the Black Prince, King Edward III&#x27;s heir. It is possible that in 1356 he participated in the Battle of Poitiers, but after this mention of him disappears. Alison Weir suggests that he could have died in battle. In any case, Walter predeceased Katherine, leaving no heirs; that is why his nephew Thomas [II] Swynford claimed his possessions in Hainaut in 1411.

==Appearance==

An epitaph on John of Gaunt&#x27;s tomb, destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, described Katherine as &quot;extraordinarily beautiful and feminine&quot;. At the same time, the epitaph itself was created during the restoration of the tomb by King Henry VII, a descendant of Katherine and John of Gaunt, who sought to restore the good reputation of his ancestor. It is possible that he emphasized beauty because Katherine was mostly remembered for it; it is possible that such a record was in Katherine&#x27;s original tomb.

There are no lifetime portraits of Katherine. The only image close to her lifetime was a rough sketch made by William Dugdale in the 17th century from a now lost copper image from her tomb in Lincoln Cathedral. However, it is not a portrait, it is a formalized drawing of a woman wearing the wimple of a widow. Also in Canterbury Cathedral are two tiny carved heads no larger than a walnut, made around 1400. They are sometimes considered to be images of John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford, but this identification, according to Alison Weir, is rather doubtful. Although two of the sons of John of Gaunt were buried in the cathedral, this happened after the creation of the carvings.

While John of Gaunt&#x27;s face was long and lean, with an aquiline nose (a distinctive feature inherited by some of his descendants), Katherine&#x27;s children had round or oval faces, a trait which Alison Weir believes they may have inherited from their mother.

The frontispiece to an early 15th-century manuscript of the epic poem &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer depicts the poet reading it to the royal court of King Richard II. The identities of the courtiers depicted in the illustration are the subject of controversy among researchers. One of the courtiers depicted is probably John of Gaunt. It has been suggested that one of the seated women, dressed in a flowing blue dress with dangling sleeves (known as houppelande), with a wide collar trimmed with white cloth, and a golden belt, is Katherine Swynford. She has a round face with a high forehead and blond hair braided high above each temple, wrapped in a ribbon around the crown of her head. However, this hypothesis has problems. The poem was probably written between 1385 and 1388. However, the manuscript itself was created only at the beginning of the 15th century, so it must depict the ladies of the court, who played an important role at the end of the reign of King Richard II. According to Alison Weir, a woman in a blue dress is too young to be Katherine. The researcher suggested that it could be her daughter Joan Beaufort, since she looks like her image in her tomb. Next to this figure is a lady wearing a tight blue dress trimmed with gold trimmed ermine, who is traditionally identified with Joan of Kent, mother of King Richard II, but she died in 1385. Weir thinks that lady might be Katherine Swynford. In the 15th century this manuscript belonged to Anne Neville, Countess of Stafford, daughter of Joan Beaufort; it is possible that it was made specifically for her, who later bequeathed it to her own daughter.

If Alison Weir&#x27;s identification is correct, Katherine was a fair-haired and buxom woman with a narrow waist and wide hips. She had a long neck, a round face with a high forehead. Her hair is elegantly combed up and pinned up under a golden crown, hinting at her high position.

==Personality==
The monastic chroniclers, who were shocked by John of Gaunt&#x27;s association with Katherine Swynford, mostly criticised her harshly. That being said, neither Thomas Walsingham nor the author of the Anonymous Chronicle likely encountered her personally. At the same time, the chronicler Henry of Knighton was a monk at Leicester Abbey who was patronized by John of Gaunt and who may have met Katherine, does not report anything wrong about her. Based on fragmentary sources, Alison Weir concludes that Katherine was &quot;an attractive, charming and sympathetic woman, quite pious&quot;. Her long affair with John of Gaunt likely suggests that she remained faithful to him, but she may also have been assertive and ambitious while enjoying material possessions. However, according to Weir, most likely Katherine was not guided by selfish considerations: despite long separations, social ostracism and denigration by society, her love for the Duke has stood the test of time. In addition, she obviously had a strong character, prudence, tact and was quite wise. Katherine valued family ties and she was not indifferent to the opinions of others.

The respect that Katherine enjoyed in the royal family probably indicates that she was quite skilled in court duties, had exquisite taste, was sociable, polite, literate, intelligent and, most likely, was a good conversationalist.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of Katherine Swynford was three gold wheels on a red field, however, judging by the heraldic emblems on the vestments given to her by Lincoln Cathedral, her coat of arms until 1396, when she married John of Gaunt, had three simple silver wheels; she probably inherited this coat of arms from her father.

After her marriage with the Duke of Lancaster in 1396, Katherine change her coat of arms, adding three gold Catherine wheels (&quot;roet&quot; means &quot;little wheel&quot; in Old French) on a red field. The wheel emblem shows Katherine&#x27;s devotion to her patron saint, Catherine of Alexandria, also known as &quot;Saint Catherine of the Wheel&quot;, who was also associated with royalty and virtue. In addition, judging by the seal of Katherine, created around 1397 after her marriage, her coat of arms not only depicted three silver wheels on a red background but combined with the coat of arms of her husband, representing the heads of three golden boars on a black chevron on a silver field. This coat of arms is not found anywhere else.

==In history and art==
Anil de Silva, author of a study on John of Gaunt, believes that Katherine could be the prototype for the beautiful Virginia, the heroine of &quot;The Physician&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which is part of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.

During the Wars of the Roses in the 1470s, the exiled Henry, Earl of Richmond, whose mother belonged to the House of Beaufort, became the Lancastrian pretender to the throne. Although Henry IV deprived the Beauforts of the right to the throne, their rights at that time began to be taken quite seriously. After Richard III became king in 1483, he publicly declared that Henry had no right to the throne, since the Beauforts were descended from &quot;double adultery&quot; (from the connection of John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford), which was accepted by many as a fact. But after the Earl of Richmond became King of England under the name of Henry VII, the notoriety of Katherine Swynford faded. At the same time, she is practically not mentioned in the chronicles of the Tudor era and did not appear in the royal family tree. When in 1520 a theatrical performance was given in Leadenhall in honor of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, an actor portraying John of Gaunt (of whom the Emperor himself was a descendant), sat near a tree from which many branches grew, representing the many Kings and Queens who were his descendants. However, Katherine, who was the ancestor of some of them, was not mentioned.

For centuries, Katherine Swynford was treated with disdain, considered immoral, and seldom mentioned as the progenitor of the House of Tudor. Interest in her arose in 1954, when the biographical novel of the American writer Anya Seton, &quot;Katherine&quot; was published. As noted by the British writer Philippa Gregory, it is considered Seton&#x27;s most famous work. The novel tells in sufficient detail the biography of Katherine, and Seton collected materials for the novel for four years, traveling all over England. However, as Alison Weir (on which the novel had a huge impact) notes, this work is primarily a novel about the ideal romantic heroine – beautiful, sensual and loving, and Seton gave Katherine many moral, emotional, and psychological qualities and cultural aspects from her own life. The release of Seton&#x27;s novel made the public empathize with this heroine and treat her more sympathetically. Later, the novel was repeatedly reprinted. In 2003 it was ranked 95th in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Read&quot; survey. 

Jeannette Lucraft&#x27;s biographical novel &quot;Katherine Swynford: The History of a Medieval Mistress&quot; was published in 2006. The biography of Katherine was studied in detail by the historian Alison Weir, who published the work &quot;Katherine Swynford: The story of John of Gaunt and his Scandalous Duchess&quot; in 2007.

<doc id="69093" wikidata="Q1130553" url="?curid=69093" title="Roundhead">
<text>Roundheads were the supporters of the Parliament of England during the English Civil War (1642–1651). Also known as Parliamentarians, they fought against King Charles I of England and his supporters, known as the Cavaliers or Royalists, who claimed rule by absolute monarchy and the principle of the divine right of kings. The goal of the Roundheads was to give to Parliament the supreme control over executive administration of the country/kingdom.

==Beliefs==
Most Roundheads sought constitutional monarchy in place of the absolute monarchy sought by Charles; however, at the end of the English Civil War in 1649, public antipathy towards the king was high enough to allow republican leaders such as Oliver Cromwell to abolish the monarchy completely and establish the Commonwealth of England.

The Roundhead commander-in-chief of the first Civil War, Thomas Fairfax, remained a supporter of constitutional monarchy, as did many other Roundhead leaders such as Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester, and Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex; however, this party was outmanoeuvred by the more politically adept Cromwell and his radicals, who had the backing of the New Model Army and took advantage of Charles&#x27; perceived betrayal of England in his alliance with the Scottish against Parliament.

England&#x27;s many Puritans and Presbyterians were almost invariably Roundhead supporters, as were many smaller religious groups such as the Independents. However, a number of Roundheads were members of the Church of England, as were most Cavaliers. Roundhead political factions included the proto-anarchist/socialist Diggers, the diverse group known as the Levellers and the apocalyptic Christian movement of the Fifth Monarchists.

==Origins and background of the term==
Some Puritans (but by no means all of them) wore their hair closely cropped round the head or flat. There was thus an obvious contrast between them and the men of courtly fashion, who wore long ringlets. During the war and for a time afterwards, &quot;Roundhead&quot; was a term of derision, and in the New Model Army it was a punishable offence to call a fellow soldier a Roundhead. This contrasted with &quot;Cavalier&quot;, a word used to describe supporters of the Royalist cause, but which also started out as a pejorative term. The first proponents used it to compare members of the Royalist party with Spanish &quot;Caballeros&quot; who had abused Dutch Protestants during the reign of Elizabeth I. However, unlike Roundhead, Cavalier was later embraced by those who were the target of the epithet and used by them to describe themselves.

&quot;Roundheads&quot; appears to have been first used as a term of derision toward the end of 1641, when the debates in Parliament in the Clergy Act 1640 were causing riots at Westminster. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition quotes a contemporary authority&#x27;s description of the crowd that gathered there: &quot;They had the hair of their heads very few of them longer than their ears, whereupon it came to pass that those who usually with their cries attended at Westminster were by a nickname called &quot;Roundheads&quot;&quot;. The demonstrators included London apprentices, for whom Roundhead was a term of derision, because the regulations which they had agreed to included a provision for closely cropped hair.

According to John Rushworth, the word was first used on 27 December 1641 by a disbanded officer named David Hide. During a riot, Hide is reported to have drawn his sword and said he would &quot;cut the throat of those round-headed dogs that bawled against bishops&quot;; however, Richard Baxter ascribes the origin of the term to a remark made by Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles I, at the trial of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, earlier that year. Referring to John Pym, she asked who the roundheaded man was. The principal advisor to Charles II, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, remarked on the matter, &quot;and from those contestations the two terms of &quot;Roundhead&quot; and &quot;Cavalier&quot; grew to be received in discourse, ... they who were looked upon as servants to the king being then called &quot;Cavaliers&quot;, and the other of the rabble contemned and despised under the name of &quot;Roundheads&quot;.&quot;

After the Anglican Archbishop William Laud made a statute in 1636 instructing all clergy to wear short hair, many Puritans rebelled to show their contempt for his authority and began to grow their hair even longer (as can be seen on their portraits) though they continued to be known as Roundheads. The longer hair was more common among the &quot;Independent&quot; and &quot;high-ranking&quot; Puritans, which included Cromwell, especially toward the end of the Protectorate, while the &quot;Presbyterian&quot; (non-Independent) faction, and the military rank and file, continued to abhor long hair. By the end of that period, some Independent Puritans were again derisively using the term Roundhead to refer to the Presbyterian Puritans.

&quot;Roundhead&quot; remained in use to describe those with republican tendencies until the Exclusion Crisis of 1678–1681, when the term was superseded by &quot;Whig&quot;, initially another term with pejorative connotations. Likewise, during the Exclusion Bill crisis, the term &quot;Cavalier&quot; was replaced with &quot;Tory&quot;, an Irish term introduced by their opponents that was also initially a pejorative term.

<text>The North-West Rebellion (), was an armed rebellion of Métis under Louis Riel and an associated uprising of Cree and Assiniboine mostly in the District of Saskatchewan, against the Canadian government. Important events included the Frog Lake incident, and the capture of Batoche.

The North-West Rebellion began in March of 1885 after Louis Riel had returned from political exile in the Montana Territory. With the assistance of Métis leader Gabriel Dumont, Riel led a rebellion against the Canadian government which consisted of roughly 250 Métis, 250 First Nations men, largely Cree and Assiniboine, who were led by First Nations chiefs such as Big Bear and Poundmaker. The government of Canada maintained a force of 5,500 men, both North-West Mounted Police and armed local residents of the North-West Territories.

The rebels seized many small settlements in north east-central Alberta and in Saskatchewan, including Fort Carlton, Fort Pitt, Battleford and Frog Lake, and won victories at Duck Lake and Fish Creek. The Cree and Assiniboine achieved victories at Cut Knife, Frenchman&#x27;s Butte and Loon Lake. However, government forces defeated the rebellion at the four-day Battle of Batoche. Following the defeat of Indigenous forces, several chiefs were put on trial and served prison time. Eight Indigenous men were hanged in Canada&#x27;s largest mass hanging, for murders performed outside the military conflict. Following the end of the Rebellion, Louis Riel was captured, put on trial, and convicted of treason. Despite pleas from across Canada for clemency, he was hanged.

==Nomenclature==
The conflict is referred to by several names, including the &quot;North-West Rebellion&quot;, the &quot;North-West Resistance&quot;, the &quot;1885 Resistance&quot;, the &quot;Northwest Uprising&quot;, the &quot;Saskatchewan Rebellion&quot;, and the &quot;Second Riel Rebellion&quot;. The conflict, grouped with the Red River Rebellion, is collectively referred to as the &quot;Riel Rebellions&quot;.

The terms &quot;rebellion&quot; and &quot;resistance&quot; can be used almost synonymously. Academics state the use of one term or the other changes the perspective of how a conflict is understood. Indigenous studies scholars and many historians refer to Indigenous uprisings in reaction to European colonization as resistances—Indigenous nations self-governed the land before the HBC and then the Canadian government exerted their sovereignty over it. Use of the term resistance has spread to several organizations and publications - &quot;Canadian Geographic&quot;, &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;, and the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan.

==Background==
After the Red River Rebellion of 1869–1870, many Métis moved from Manitoba to the Fort Carlton region of the North-West Territories, where they founded the Southbranch settlements of Fish Creek, Batoche, St. Laurent, St. Louis, and Duck Lake on or near the South Saskatchewan River. In 1882, surveyors began dividing the land in the newly formed District of Saskatchewan according to the Dominion Land Survey&#x27;s square township system. The established Métis farms were laid out in the seigneurial system, narrow strips stretching up from a river. The Métis were familiar with this system from their French-Canadian culture. After the experience of the 1869 Red River rebellion, surveyors were allowed to make exceptions to the standard survey practice, to accommodate pre-existing riverlot farms within two kilometres of a river. But that was scant consideration of the old-time communities. Outside accepted riverlot groupings, the survey imposed a standard grid on the land, allocating particular numbered sections in each township to the HBC and the CPR.

The 36 families of the St. Louis settlement found, after the Dominion Land Survey was done, that the Crown had sold their farms and the village site, which included a church and a school (in Township 45, Range 7 west of the 2nd Meridian of the Dominion Land Survey), to the Prince Albert Colonization Company. The families feared the loss of their homes and farms, which, now that the buffalo herds were gone, was their primary source of sustenance.

In 1884, the Métis in the Southbranch settlements (including many Anglo-Métis) sent a delegation to ask Louis Riel to return from the United States, where he had fled after the Red River Rebellion, to appeal to the government on their behalf. He came and sent an appeal to the government. The government gave a vague response. The following year, on March 8, 1885, Riel and other prominent Métis at Batoche passed a 10-point “Revolutionary Bill of Rights” that asserted Métis rights of possession to their farms and demanded, among other things, that the government establish an office dealing with land issues in the North-West.

On March 18, 1885, Riel, Gabriel Dumont, Honoré Jackson (a.k.a. Will Jackson), and others took the seminal step of setting up the Provisional Government of Saskatchewan, believing they could influence the federal government in the same way as they had in 1869.
But much had changed since the Red River Rebellion. A railway had been completed across the prairies in 1883, though sections were not yet completed north of Lake Superior in Northern Ontario. The railway eased the transit of government troops to Qu&#x27;Appelle. Qu&#x27;Appelle was more than 1800 miles (3000 km) from Toronto and 160 miles (260 km) in direct line from Batoche.

The North-West Mounted Police (NWMP), created in 1874, served as an armed force as well. Its local detachments provided government presence at some trouble spots, at least potentially protected vulnerable settlements, and also provided guidance and local knowledge to the neophyte Ontario and Quebec militia troops.

As violence broke out, it became clear that English-speaking settlers on the prairies and the great majority of First Nations did not support Riel. Catholic officials saw as heresy Riel&#x27;s claim that God had sent him back to Canada as a prophet, and they tried to minimize his support. Catholic priest Albert Lacombe worked to obtain assurances from Crowfoot that his Blackfoot warriors would not participate in a conflict.

The First Nations were also frustrated at conditions at the time. By the end of the 1870s, the stage was set for discontent among the Indigenous people of the prairies: fur-animals and bison were scarce (causing enormous economic and food supply difficulties) and, in an attempt to assert control over Indigenous population, federal government officials sometimes held back rations, violating the terms of the treaties it had signed just prior.

First Nations&#x27; dissatisfaction with the treaties and rampant poverty spurred Cree chief Big Bear to embark on a diplomatic campaign to renegotiate the terms of the treaties. (The timing of this campaign coincided with widespread frustration among Métis but it seems the Cree and Métis did not act in unison.)

Some Cree took violent action in the spring of 1885, when the rebellion of Riel and the Métis was happening at same time, but at least one researcher states that they were almost certainly unrelated. In both the Frog Lake Massacre and the Looting of Battleford, small dissident groups of Cree men revolted against white authorities, ignoring the leadership of Big Bear and Poundmaker. Although he quietly signalled to Ottawa that these two incidents were the result of desperate and starving people and were, as such, unrelated to the ongoing Métis rebellion, Edgar Dewdney, the lieutenant governor of the territories, publicly claimed that the Cree and the Métis had joined forces.

==Demographics==

The 1885 census of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Alberta reported a total population of 48,362. Of this, 20,170 people (about 40 percent) were Status Indians.

The District of Saskatchewan, part of the North-West Territories in 1885, was divided into three sub-districts and had a population of 10,595. To the east, the Carrot River sub-district with 1,770 people remained quiet. The Prince Albert sub-district in the centre of the district had a population of 5,373 which included the Southbranch settlements with about 1,300. The South branch settlement was the centre of Louis Riel&#x27;s Provisional Government of Saskatchewan during the conflict. To the west, the Battleford sub-district where the Cree uprising of people in bands led by Poundmaker and Big Bear occurred, had 3,603 people.

The largest settlement and the capital of the district was Prince Albert with about 800 people followed by Battleford with about 500 people who were &quot;divided about equally between French, Métis and English&quot;.

The Métis population in Saskatchewan in 1885 was about 5,400. A majority tried to stay neutral in the dispute with the national government, as the priests recommended. About 350 armed men supported Riel. A smaller number opposed him, led by Charles Nolin. In addition, he had the support of a small number of members of First Nations. Riel&#x27;s supporters included the older, less assimilated Métis, often with close associations with the First Nations population. Many moved back and forth into First Nations communities and preferred to speak Indigenous languages more than French. Riel&#x27;s opponents were younger, better educated Métis; they wanted to be more integrated into Canadian society, not to set up a separate domain as Riel promised.

==The course of the rebellion and its suppression==
On March 18, 1885, Riel, Gabriel Dumont, Honoré Jackson (a.k.a. Will Jackson), and others set up the Provisional Government of Saskatchewan. Riel had been invited in to lead the movement but he turned it into a military action with a heavily religious tone, thereby alienating the Catholic clergy, the whites, nearly all of the First Nations, and most of the Métis. He had a force of a couple hundred Métis and a smaller number of First Nations at Batoche in May 1885, confronting isolated groups of armed settlers, HBC trading posts and NWMP detachments, and two small militia units at Winnipeg.

Reports of the provisional government were discredited at Ottawa and at first thought to be a device of the Liberal party, but on March 23 Prime Minister Macdonald publicly confirmed the news of the rebellion. Immediately the federal government sent Major General Frederick Middleton, the commander of the Canadian Militia, to Winnipeg, where a militia unit, the 90th Winnipeg Rifles, and a militia artillery unit, the Winnipeg Field Battery, already existed. Eventually, over a period of many weeks, Middleton brought 3,000 troops to the West, and incorporated another 2,000, mostly English-Canadian volunteers, and 500 North-West Mounted Police into his force. They were formed into three columns that independently marched north from the line of the CPR. 
Hearing that rebels had seized Duck Lake, a settlement near Batoche, a force of 90 Prince Albert Volunteers and North-West Mounted Police, led by their superintendent Leif Newry Fitzroy Crozier, set off from Fort Carlton on March 26, 1885, to confront the rebels. They were stopped and turned back by 150 to 200 Métis and Aboriginal fighters, under the command of Gabriel Dumont, in the Battle of Duck Lake.

On March 30, a group of armed Cree, short of food due to declining bison populations, approached Battleford. The inhabitants fled to the nearby North-West Mounted Police post at Fort Battleford. The Cree then took food and supplies from the abandoned stores and houses.

In March 1885, Fort Carlton was destroyed by fire accidentally as it was being evacuated.

===Government mobilization===
After the declaration of a provisional government, lawlessness in the Batoche area and the Battle at Duck Lake, the government immediately commenced the mobilization of some of Canada&#x27;s ill-equipped part-time militia units (the Non-Permanent Active Militia), as well as the units of cavalry, artillery and infantry regulars that made up the tiny Permanent Active Militia, Canada&#x27;s almost-nonexistent regular army.
By March 30, after hasty mobilization in Toronto, two trains containing the 10th Royal Grenadiers and Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles militia battalions were ready to leave Toronto. Other militia units, the 9th Voltigeurs from Quebec City, and the 65th Mount Royal Rifles from Montreal, were also quickly mobilized. Soon every major city in the East was the scene of embarkation for inexperienced young militiamen cheered by immense crowds.

Many of the soldiers suffered from the winter weather during the transit to the trouble spot. The militia struggling westward had to contend with the many large breaks in the CPR line in northern Ontario. They marched through snow or were carried in exposed sleighs. They rode on rustic railway flatcars over the completed stretches of track, which did not shelter them from the cold. During the campaign the troops dealt with snow, muskeg and black mud.

Enlistment and popular engagement in the suppression of the rebellion rose after several non-combatants were killed at Frog Lake. On April 2, at Frog Lake, District of Saskatchewan (now in Alberta) a Cree raiding party led by Cree war chief Wandering Spirit, attacked local officials in the small settlement. Wandering Spirit&#x27;s men were angered by what seemed to be unfair treaties and the withholding of vital provisions by the Canadian government, and also by the dwindling buffalo population, their main source of food. The attack was made against the leadership of Big Bear, following the arrival of news of the Métis victory at Duck Lake. Gathering the white settlers in the area into or near the local church, they killed Thomas Quinn, the town&#x27;s Indian agent, after a disagreement broke out. The Cree then killed eight more and took three hostages. When the conflict was over, the government hanged Wandering Spirit and several others for what they had done at Frog Lake.

The Canadian militia was commanded by Major General Frederick Middleton, who had had previous experience imposing imperial rule over Maori and Indian Mutineers. Middleton assembled a force that detrained from CPR trains at Qu&#x27;Appelle and then moved north toward Batoche. His column left from Qu&#x27;Appelle on April 6 and arrived at Batoche a month later, on the way fighting the Battle of Fish Creek 26 km from Batoche.

Meanwhile, William Otter&#x27;s force detrained at Swift Current and proceeded north to restore order at the Battlefords, fighting the Battle of Cut Knife on the way
Other forces were formed in the West. The Alberta Field Force led by Thomas Bland Strange, assembled at Calgary, moved north on the Calgary and Edmonton Trail to secure Edmonton from attack, then went down the North Saskatchewan River to secure Victoria Settlement, recapture Fort Pitt, then moved overland in pursuit of Big Bear&#x27;s band.

===April–May Métis and First Nations victories===
On April 15, 200 Cree fighters descended on Fort Pitt. They intercepted an NWMP scouting party, killing Constable Cowan, wounding another, and captured a third. Surrounded and outnumbered, garrison commander Inspector Francis Dickens, son of the famous author, negotiated with the attackers and capitulated. Big Bear allowed the remaining police officers to leave safely. Inspector Dickens and his officers reached safety at Battleford six days later. The Cree fighters kept the townspeople as hostages, taking them to their camp at Frog Lake, and after a second raid in May, destroyed the fort.

Cree insurgents looted Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company posts at Lac la Biche and Green Lake on April 26. The HBC post at Lac La Biche was pillaged. Fort Victoria (Pakan) was attacked but the attack was thwarted.

By April 24, Middleton&#x27;s column had made a gradual but unopposed advance to Fish Creek only 26 km from Batoche. That day 200 Métis achieved a remarkable victory over Middleton&#x27;s column numbering 900 soldiers. The reversal, though not decisive enough to alter the outcome of the war, temporarily halted the advance of Middleton&#x27;s column toward Batoche. That was where the Métis made their final stand two weeks later.

Otter&#x27;s column, working toward Battleford, meanwhile also suffered a setback. The column, led by Lieutenant Colonel William Otter, attacked a sleeping Cree encampment on Cut Knife Hill 45 km northwest of Battleford on May 2. Cree fighters under war chief Fine-Day successfully held off the soldiers in the Battle of Cut Knife. Despite its use of a Gatling gun, Otter&#x27;s flying column of militia was forced to retreat. Big Bear did not fight in the battle and personally prevailed on the Cree fighters not to harass the retreating Canadian troops. Fine-Day was affiliated with the chief Poundmaker, who surrendered to government troops later that same month.

=== Ending the Métis uprising ===

On May 12, Middleton&#x27;s force captured Batoche itself. The greatly outnumbered but well-entrenched Métis fighters ran out of ammunition after three days of battle and siege. The Métis resorted to firing sharp objects and small rocks from their guns. They were finally killed or dispersed when Canadian soldiers advanced on their own and overran the Métis fighters in their rifle pits.

Riel surrendered on May 15. Gabriel Dumont and other participants in the uprising escaped across the border to the Montana Territory of the United States. The defeat of the Métis and Riel&#x27;s capture led to the collapse of the Provisional Government.

=== Ending the Cree uprising ===
But the capture of Batoche did not end the separate conflict with the Cree insurgents.

Otter&#x27;s column recovered from its defeat at Cut Knife Hill (today&#x27;s Poundmaker Hill) and pressed on to secure Battleford from additional Cree raids. Poundmaker and several of the chiefs loyal to him marched into Battleford and surrendered on May 26.

On May 14 Major General Thomas Bland Strange led the Alberta Field Force, a mixed force of militia and an NWMP detachment from Calgary, eastwards down the North Saskatchewan, toward the scene of unrest. Part of his force was on barges; the rest on foot or horseback on shore. Conditions were unpleasant as it was cold and snowy. By May 25 the force was at Fort Pitt and Frog Lake. On May 28, the force came into contact with Big Bear&#x27;s band who had been holding a Thirst Dance on a hill north of Fort Pitt, camped with hostages from Frog Lake and Fort Pitt. The soldiers advanced to attack, but fighters in the band won a battle at Frenchman&#x27;s Butte, 43 km northeast of Lloydminster, at the end of May. Big Bear&#x27;s band pushed off the north, and NWMP Major Sam Steele&#x27;s mounted scouts followed the trail.

At Loon Lake, about 60 km northeast of Frenchman&#x27;s Butte, on June 3, the scouts and Big Bear&#x27;s band fought in the last armed engagement of the 1885 rebellion. That day Steele&#x27;s scouts, numbering 65, caught up to Big Bear&#x27;s force. Big Bear&#x27;s fighters were almost out of ammunition. They released their hostages and fled across the lake at Steele Narrows, after a short exchange of fire.

Demoralized, defenceless, and with no hope of relief after Poundmaker&#x27;s surrender, most of Big Bear&#x27;s fighters surrendered over the next few weeks. On July 2 Big Bear voluntarily surrendered to NWMP Sargeant Smart, stationed at an NWMP post near the destroyed Fort Carlton.

==Aftermath==
The conflict was Canada&#x27;s first independent military action. It cost about $5 million. Although it lost the Conservative Party most of its support in Quebec, it guaranteed Anglophone control of the Prairies and demonstrated the national government was capable of decisive action.

For reason perhaps outside the context of the rebellion, the Liberal party remained popular on the Prairies at least among Métis and among the wave of immigrants that soon came to the Prairies. (Treaty Indians did not get the vote until much later.)

The trial of Louis Riel occurred shortly after the conflict, where he was found guilty of high treason, and hanged. His trial and execution sparked a national controversy between English and French Canada.

Poundmaker and Big Bear were sentenced to prison.

Eight others were hanged in the largest mass hanging in Canadian history. These men, found guilty of killing outside of the military conflict, were Wandering Spirit, (Kapapamahchakwew) a Plains Cree war chief, Little Bear (Apaschiskoos), Walking the Sky (AKA Round the Sky), Bad Arrow, Miserable Man, Iron Body, Ika (AKA Crooked Leg) and Man Without Blood, for murders committed at Frog Lake and at Battleford (the murders of Farm Instructor Payne and Battleford farmer Barney Tremont).

The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) played a key role in the government&#x27;s response to the conflict, as it was able to transport federal troops to the area quickly. While it had taken three months to get troops to the Red River Rebellion, the government was able to move forces in nine days by train in response to events in the North-West Territories. The successful operation increased political support for the floundering and incomplete railway, which had been close to financial collapse. The government authorized enough funds to finish the line. Thus, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald realized his National Dream of linking Canada across the continent.

The government addressed the critical food shortage of the Cree and Assiniboine by sending food and other supplies.

After the fighting, new Territorial Council ridings were created, although still only covering specific areas of concentrated settlement. The North-West Territories election of 1885 was held. The Scrip Commission was dispatched to the District of Saskatchewan and to present-day Alberta to address Métis land claims.

The Saskatchewan Métis requested land grants; the government granted these to all by the end of 1887. The government resurveyed the official surveys to allow pre-existing Métis riverlots in accordance with their wishes. In 1888 Dominion Land Survey officials resurveyed townships in Range 42, 43, 44, and 45, land along the South Saskatchewan River that was historically Métis land. Portions of these townships were divided into riverlots. This new survey recognized the Métis&#x27; long-standing land use and addressed a key grievance of the local Métis. The Métis did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and sold much of it to speculators who later resold it to farmers.

Those who served with the Militia and NWMP during the conflict received the North West Canada Medal, established in September 1885.

The cause of the rebellion was soon subject of debate. Macdonald&#x27;s government came in for heavy criticism.

During the 1887 federal election, members of Sir Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s Liberal Party told the House of Commons that federal surveyors had &quot;mishandled western settlement&quot; and blamed the &quot;poor administration of Metis land claims&quot; for the 1885 rebellion. The federal Minister of the Interior investigated and had land surveyor William Pearce submit a report explaining the work of the surveyors.

===International reaction===
While the conflict was ongoing, the American and British press took note of the actions of both the Métis and the Canadian Government. Some newspapers, such as the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot;, wrote approvingly of the actions taken by the Canadian government.

==Long-term consequences==
The French language and Catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the emerging controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. Many Métis were forced to live on undesirable land, or in temporary locations such as road allowances, or in the shadow of Indian reserves (The Métis did not have treaty status, like Treaty Indians did, so did not have any official right to land).

Riel&#x27;s trial and Macdonald&#x27;s refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting upset in Quebec, and led to a fundamental francophone distrust of Anglophone politicians. French Canada felt it had been unfairly targeted.

==Memory==
In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck Lake, that &quot;the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Rebellion is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples&#x27; struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.&quot;

Batoche, where the Métis Provisional Government had been formed, has been declared a National Historic Site. Batoche marks the site of Gabriel Dumont&#x27;s grave site, Albert Caron&#x27;s House, Batoche school, Batoche cemetery, Letendre store, Dumont&#x27;s river crossing, Gariépy&#x27;s crossing, Batoche crossing, St. Antoine de Padoue Church, Métis rifle pits, and RNWMP battle camp.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police training depot at Regina was established in 1874, and still survives. The RCMP chapel, a frame building built in 1885, is still standing. It was used to jail prisoners taken when the rebellion collapsed.

One of three Territorial Government Buildings still stands on Dewdney Avenue in the city of Regina. It was the site of the Trial of Louis Riel, where the drama the &quot;Trial of Louis Riel&quot; is still performed. Following the May trial, Louis Riel was hanged November 16, 1885 at the North-West Mounted Police barracks in Regina. The RCMP Heritage Centre, in Regina, opened in May 2007. The Métis brought his body to Saint-Vital, his mother&#x27;s home, now the Riel House National Historic Site, and then interred it at the Saint-Boniface Basilica in Manitoba, his birthplace, for burial. Highway 11, stretching from Regina to just south of Prince Albert, has been named &quot;Louis Riel Trail&quot; by the province; the roadway passes near locations of the conflict.

Fort Carlton Provincial Historic Site has been rebuilt as it had been ravaged by three separate fires. Big Bear (Mistahimaskwa) used the site in his initial negotiations for Treaty Six in about 1884, and finally, the following year he surrendered here after his engagement at Steele Narrows (Battle of Loon Lake).

The Prince Albert blockhouse was employed by the North-West Mounted Police on evacuating from Fort Carlton after the first fire.

Duck Lake is home to the Duck Lake Historical Museum and the Duck Lake Regional Interpretive Centre, and murals that present the history of the conflict in the area. The Battle of Duck Lake, the Duck Lake Massacre, and a buffalo jump are all located here. The &quot;First Shots Cairn&quot; was erected on Saskatchewan Highway 212 as a landmark commemorating the scene of the first shots in the Battle of Duck Lake. Our Lady of Lourdes Shrine at St. Laurent north of Duck Lake is a local pilgrimage site.

The Battle of Fish Creek National Historic Site, the name has been changed to Tourond&#x27;s Coulee / Fish Creek National Historic Site to preserve the battlefield of April 24, 1885, at &quot;la coulée des Tourond&quot;, Madame Tourond&#x27;s home, early Red River cart Fish Creek Trail and the site of Middleton&#x27;s camp and graveyard.

The Marr Residence is a municipal heritage property of Saskatoon which served as a field hospital for wounded soldiers during the conflict.

Fort Otter was constructed at Battleford&#x27;s government house at the capital of the North-West Territories. Poundmaker was arrested at Fort Battleford and sentenced to a prison term. Eight First Nations men were hanged, five for murders in the Frog Lake Massacre, two for murders in the Battleford area, and one for the killing of a Mountie at Fort Pitt on April 15. Fort Battleford has been declared a national historic site of Canada to commemorate its role as military base of operations for Cut Knife Hill and Fort Pitt, as a refuge for 500 settlers, and as battlefield itself (the Siege of Battleford).

Fort Pitt, the scene of the Battle of Fort Pitt, is a provincial park and national historic site where a National Historic Sites and Monuments plaque designates where Treaty Six was signed.

Frog Lake Massacre National Historic Site of Canada, at Frog Lake, Alberta, is the location of a Cree uprising that occurred in the District of Saskatchewan, North-West Territories.

Frenchman Butte, a national historic site of Canada, is the location of the 1885 battle between Cree and Canadian troops of Strange&#x27;s Alberta Field Force.

At Cutknife is the world&#x27;s largest tomahawk, the Poundmaker Historical Centre and Big Bear monument/cairn erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. There is also now, correctly located, a cairn erected upon Cut Knife Hill, which is the viewing site of the Poundmaker Battle site and Battle River valley.

The Narrows between Makwa Lake and Sanderson Bay, in the Makwa Lake Provincial Park, was the site of the last engagement of the conflict, the Battle of Loon Lake. Steele Narrows Provincial Historic Park conserves the lookout point of a Cree burial ground.

Fort Ethier, a two-story log blockhouse built by Strange&#x27;s Alberta Field Force in its march north to Edmonton, still stands near Wetaskiwin.

The members of the Canadian Militia are commemorated through a number of memorials in Canada, including the North-West Rebellion Monument in Queen&#x27;s Park, in Toronto, Ontario, and The Volunteer Monument in Winnipeg, Manitoba. A statue for Wm. B. Osgoode and John Rogers, who fell in action at Cutknife Hill, also stands at the Cartier Square Drill Hall, in Ottawa, Ontario.

==Historiography==
Arthur Silver Morton, who was the University of Saskatchewan&#x27;s first librarian, compiled many of the original manuscripts, transcripts, and photographs related to the 1885 conflict that were made available in 1995 as part of project funded by Industry Canada in 1995.

Canadian historian George Stanley conducted research on the 1885 conflict and Louis Riel in the 1930s while completing his postgraduate degrees at Oxford University, where he published his 1936 book &quot;The Birth of Western Canada: A History of The Riel Rebellion&quot;. For more than five decades Stanley&#x27;s 1936 &quot;The Birth of Western Canada&quot; was reprinted and used as a textbook. Stanley&#x27;s 1936 book and the 1972 book published by his student Desmond Morton&quot;The last war drum: the North West campaign of 1885&quot; informed North-West Rebellion encyclopedia entries in the &quot;Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; and &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;. Stanley focused on the racial aspects of the rebellion. He demonstrated empathy with the plight of the Métis and First Nations, although in hindsight his work would now be described by many as both &quot;racist and close-minded&quot;. Until the early 2000s, Stanley&#x27;s served as the foundational textbook providing the accepted narrative on the events.

The next major academic work to treat the &quot;rebellion as a whole&quot; since Stanley&#x27;s, was the 1984 publication &quot;Prairie Fire: The 1885 North-West Rebellion&quot; by historian Bob Beal and journalist Rod Macleod. They downplayed the event as local with &quot;no real legacy of bitterness in the West&quot;. They describe it as an incident during the white settlers&#x27; occupation of the North-West Territories and government&#x27;s imposition of their laws on the indigenous population.

On the centenary of the conflict, a conference entitled &quot;1885 and After: Native Society in Transition&quot; was held in May at the University of Saskatchewan. During the centenary, a number of articles and books were published on the topic including the five-volume &quot;The Collected Writings of Louis Riel&quot; by Stanley, Raymond Huel, Gilles Martel, and University of Calgary-based political scientist, Thomas Flanagan, and Flanagan&#x27;s &quot;Riel and the Rebellion: 1885 Reconsidered.&quot; Flanagan spent much of his academic career focusing on issues related to the Métis and Louis Riel. Since the 1970s Tom Flanagan published numerous scholarly studies &quot;debunking the heroism of Métis icon Louis Riel, arguing against native land claims, and calling for an end to aboriginal rights.&quot;

In his 1987 publication &quot;Footprints in the Dust&quot;, Douglas Light focused on the local history of the region incorporating Métis and First Nation perspectives on events including accounts of everyday life. This was described as a &quot;valuable and distinctive contribution to rebellion historiography&quot;.

At the University of Saskatchewan, Alan Anderson prepared a report on French Settlements in Saskatchewan that informed relevant content in the online &quot;Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan,&quot; published in 2006 by the University of Regina&#x27;s Canadian Plains Research Center.

J.R.Miller&#x27;s 1989 &quot;Skyscrapers Hide the Heavens&quot; was described in a 2021 &quot;British Journal of Canadian Studies&quot; article as the &quot;first overall survey of Aboriginal–newcomer history in Canada&quot;. Miller &quot;consistently highlighted the Aboriginal perspective&quot;. By 2018, when the book was reprinted for the fourth time, the relationships between Indigenous peoples and settlers had evolved further driven by priorities, economic opportunities, collective action on the part of Indigenous communities, and changes in governments at the federal, provincial and territorial levels. Miller says that early relations between Indigenous people and Euro-Canadian were characterized by a mutuality and collaboration, with each remaining autonomous, especially in trading relationships and as military allies. Miller says that this mutuality &quot;held good for far longer than white historiography has tended to see. The mutuality collapsed through competition for resources particularly as agricultural settlers arrived in increasing numbers. In his chapter on the rebellion, Miller says that the way histories about the conflict have been written are based on &quot;a great deal of misunderstanding and myth-making&quot; and that there was no Indian rebellion in 1885.

Lawrence J. Barkwell&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;Batoche 1885: The Militia of the Metis Liberation Movement&quot; was his first publication of biographies of participants in the Métis resistance. Barkwell is also the author of the 2011 305-page book &quot;Veterans and Families of the 1885 Northwest Resistance&quot;. He updated his &quot;1885 Northwest Resistance Movement Biographies&quot; in 2018 which lists the men and women who participated in the 1885 Northwest Resistance. Barwell&#x27;s research, which is published by the Gabriel Dumont Institutean affiliate of the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Regina&quot;provides a more human face&quot; to the 1885 Resistance.&quot;

<doc id="69099" wikidata="Q1780487" url="?curid=69099" title="List of political parties in Poland">
<text>This article lists current political parties in Poland, as well as former parties dating back as far as 1918. Since 1989, Poland has had a multi-party system, with numerous competing political parties. Individual parties normally do not manage to gain power alone, and usually work with other parties to form coalition governments.

The transition from a mono-party Communist regime to liberal democracy and pluralism resulted in new political parties mushrooming in the early 1990s. After the first free parliamentary elections in 1991 seats in the Sejm were divided among more than a dozen different parties (amongst them such curiosities as the Polish Beer-Lovers&#x27; Party (&quot;Polska Partia Przyjaciół Piwa&quot;), led by a popular comedy actor, Janusz Rewiński). The existence of so many parties in the Sejm was seen by many as being counterproductive to the effectiveness of the parliament and a hindrance towards producing stable governments. Consequently, electoral reform was undertaken and an electoral threshold for the Lower House was instituted prior to the 1993 elections. The set threshold required a minimum vote of 5% for parties (with exemptions for ethnic minority parties) and 8% for electoral coalitions. The threshold was set at the national, rather than divisional, level, and had the effect of preventing many minor parties from winning seats in later elections. The threshold also prevented independent candidates from gaining election to the Sejm. Since 1990, the left side of the political scene has generally been dominated by former Communists turned social democrats. The right has largely comprised (former) Solidarity activists and supporters, but experienced deep divisions from the beginning, and showed less cohesiveness than the left. The right were unable to create a single bloc which could act as a lasting counterweight to the left-wing monolith, but instead, kept merging, splitting and renaming. Even so, the parties of the right did manage to win government again from 1997 to 2001 (having initially governed from 1989 to 1993).

Since the parliamentary elections of 2005, the right-wing parties have dominated the political scene, and appear to be in their strongest position to date. Two important developments in the political landscape have taken place since 2005. Firstly, the SLD (Communist successor) party is no longer the major, or one of the two major parties. Secondly, the main political battleground is no longer between the ex-Solidarity right versus the ex-Communist left. The new competing groupings are those of the Law and Justice party (promoting economic interventionism and social conservatism) and the Civic Platform (representing a more liberal-conservative position). The general public disapproval of politics and politicians as a whole has resulted in almost all major parties excluding the very word &quot;party&quot; from their names, replacing it with words less associated with politics, such as &quot;union&quot;, &quot;platform&quot;, &quot;league&quot; or &quot;alliance&quot;.

<doc id="69100" wikidata="Q982472" url="?curid=69100" title="Henry Beaufort">
<text>Henry Beaufort (c. 1375 – 11 April 1447) was an English Catholic prelate and statesman who held the offices of Bishop of Lincoln (1398), Bishop of Winchester (1404) and cardinal (1426). He served three times as Lord Chancellor and played an important role in English politics. 

Beaufort was a member of the royal House of Plantagenet, being the second son of the four legitimised children of John of Gaunt (third son of King Edward III) by his mistress (later wife) Katherine Swynford.

==Life==
Beaufort is often claimed to have been born at Beaufort, an English domain in France, but England, John of Gaunt specifically, had already lost that land holding, which had come to him through his grandmother Blanche of Artois. He was educated for a career in the Church. After his parents were married in early 1396, Henry, his two brothers and one sister were declared legitimate by Pope Boniface IX and legitimated by Act of Parliament on 9 February 1397, but they were barred from the succession to the throne.

On 27 February 1398, he was nominated Bishop of Lincoln, and on 14 July 1398, he was consecrated. After Henry of Bolingbroke deposed Richard II and took the throne as Henry IV in 1399, he made Bishop Beaufort Lord Chancellor of England in 1403, but Beaufort resigned in 1404 when he was appointed Bishop of Winchester on 19 November.

Between 1411 and 1413, Bishop Beaufort was in political disgrace for siding with his nephew, the Prince of Wales, against the king, but when King Henry IV died and the prince became King Henry V, he was made Chancellor once again in 1413, but he resigned the position in 1417. Pope Martin V offered him the rank of Cardinal, but King Henry V would not permit him to accept the offer.

Henry V died in 1422, two years after he had married Catherine of Valois, daughter of King Charles VI, who had disowned his son Charles in favour of Henry in the Treaty of Troyes. Henry and Catherine&#x27;s infant son Henry VI, the Bishop&#x27;s great-nephew, succeeded Henry as King of England, and, in accordance with the Treaty, succeeded Charles as King of France. Bishop Beaufort and the child king&#x27;s other uncles formed the Regency government, and in 1424, Beaufort became Chancellor once more, but was forced to resign in 1426 because of disputes with the king&#x27;s other uncles, in particular Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester.

Pope Martin V finally appointed Beaufort as Cardinal in 1426. In 1427, he made him the Papal Legate for Germany, Hungary and Bohemia, and directed him to lead the fourth &quot;crusade&quot; against the Hussites heretics in Bohemia. Beaufort&#x27;s forces were routed by the Hussites at the Battle of Tachov on 4 August 1427.

After the capture of Joan of Arc in 1431, legend has it that Beaufort was present to observe some of the heresy trial sessions presided over by Bishop Pierre Cauchon of Beauvais. However, the full record of the trial, which lists all those who took part in her trial on a daily basis shows that he was not there. His sole appearance is on the day of her abjuration (26 May 1431). The formal record does not include Beaufort&#x27;s presence at her execution but legend has it that he wept as he viewed the horrible scene as she was burned at the stake. This legend derives from what is now known as the Rehabilitation Trial of Joan of Arc which culminated in an examination of numerous witnesses in 1455 and 1456 in which one of the 27 Articles of Enquiry was that Joan had died in &quot;such a manner as to draw from all those present, and even from her English enemies, effusions of tears.&quot; A number of witnesses at this re-trial inferred or declared his presence including one of the original trial judges, one Andre Marguerie, Canon of Rouen, who asserted that Beaufort had reprimanded his chaplain for complaining that the Bishop of Beauvais&#x27;s sermon was too favourable to Joan. However, it is not clear to which sermon Marguerie was referring.

In a spirit of contrition and reconciliation, in 1922 a statue of Joan of Arc (carved under the supervision of Sir Ninian Comper) was placed beside the entrance to the Lady Chapel in Winchester Cathedral diagonally facing Cardinal Beaufort&#x27;s tomb and chantry chapel.

Beaufort continued to be active in English politics for years, fighting with the other powerful advisors to the king. He died on 11 April 1447.

==Affair and daughter==
When Henry was Bishop of Lincoln, he had an illegitimate daughter, Jane Beaufort, with an unknown woman, sometimes thought to be the daughter of Alice Cherleton, Baroness Cherleton: &quot;Henry fathered an illegitimate daughter, Jane Beaufort, in 1402, who some make Alice&#x27;s daughter. Both Jane and her husband, Sir Edward Stradling, were named in Cardinal Beaufort&#x27;s will. Their marriage about 1423 brought Sir Edward into the political orbit of his shrewd and assertive father-in-law, to whom he may have owed his appointment as chamberlain of South Wales in December 1423, a position he held until March 1437&quot;.

<text>Xfce or XFCE (pronounced as four individual letters, ) is a free and open-source desktop environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

Xfce aims to be fast and lightweight while still visually appealing and easy to use. The desktop environment is designed to embody the traditional Unix philosophy of modularity and re-usability, as well as adherence to standards; specifically, those defined at freedesktop.org. 

== Features ==
=== User experience ===
Xfce is a highly modular desktop environment, with many software repositories separating its components into multiple packages. The built-in settings app offers options to customize the GTK theme, the system icons, the cursor, and the window manager. Additionally, Xfce provides a fully GUI-based system for modifying the desktop&#x27;s status bar and system tray.

=== Performance ===
Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment which omits many of the visually appealing features (such as animations) present in other desktop environments such as KDE Plasma and GNOME. These omissions allow Xfce to run much more smoothly on low-end personal computers.

== History ==
Olivier Fourdan started the Xfce project in late 1996 as a Linux version of the Common Desktop Environment (CDE), a Unix desktop environment that was initially proprietary and later released as free software. 

The name was originally an abbreviation of XForms Common Environment, which referred to the XForms library, however, Xfce has been transformed and is now based entirely on the Xfce Toolkit (GTK). 

The first Xfce release was in early 1997. However, over time, Xfce diverged from CDE and now stands on its own. The Slackware Linux distribution has nicknamed Xfce the &quot;Cholesterol Free Desktop Environment&quot;, a loose interpretation of the initialism.

=== Mascot ===
Per the FAQ, the logo of Xfce is &quot;a mouse, obviously, for all kinds of reasons like world domination and monsters and such.&quot; In the &quot;SuperTuxKart&quot; game, in which various open source mascots race against each other, the mouse is said to be a female named &quot;Xue&quot;.

=== Early versions ===
Xfce began as a simple project created with XForms. Olivier Fourdan released the program, which was just a simple taskbar, on SunSITE.

Fourdan continued developing the project and in 1998, Xfce 2 was released with the first version of Xfce&#x27;s window manager, Xfwm. He requested the project be included in Red Hat Linux, but it was refused due to its XForms basis. Red Hat accepted only open-source software released under a GPL- or BSD-compatible license, whereas, at the time, XForms was closed-source and free only for personal use. For the same reason, Xfce was not in Debian before version 3, and Xfce 2 was distributed only in Debian&#x27;s contrib repository.

In March 1999, Fourdan began a complete rewrite of the project based on GTK, a non-proprietary toolkit then rising in popularity. The result was Xfce 3.0, licensed under the GPL. As well as being based completely on free software, it gained GTK drag-and-drop support, native language support, and improved configurability. Xfce was uploaded to SourceForge.net in February 2001, starting with version 3.8.1.

=== Modern Xfce ===

In version 4.0.0, released 25 September 2003, Xfce was upgraded to use the GTK 2 libraries. Changes in 4.2.0, released 16 January 2005, included a compositing manager for Xfwm which added built-in support for transparency and drop shadows, as well as a new default SVG icon set. In January 2007, Xfce 4.4.0 was released. This included the Thunar file manager, a replacement for Xffm. Support for desktop icons was added. Also, various improvements were made to the panel to prevent buggy plugins from crashing the whole panel. In February 2009, Xfce 4.6.0 was released. This version had a new configuration backend, a new settings manager and a new sound mixer, as well as several significant improvements to the session manager and the rest of Xfce&#x27;s core components.

In January 2011, Xfce 4.8.0 was released. This version included changes such as the replacement of ThunarVFS and HAL with GIO, udev, ConsoleKit and PolicyKit, and new utilities for browsing remote network shares using several protocols including SFTP, SMB, and FTP. Window clutter was reduced by merging all Thunar file progress dialog boxes into a single dialog. The panel application was also rewritten for better positioning, transparency, and item and launcher management. 4.8 also introduced a new menu plugin to view directories. The 4.8 plugin framework remains compatible with 4.6 plugins. The display configuration dialog in 4.8 supports RandR 1.2, detecting screens automatically and allowing users to pick their preferred display resolution, refresh rate, and display rotation. Multiple displays can be configured to either work in clone mode, or be placed next to each other. Keyboard selection was revamped to be easier and more user-friendly. Also, the manual settings editor was updated to be more functional.

The 4.8 development cycle was the first to use the new release strategy formed after the &quot;Xfce Release and Development Model&quot; developed at the Ubuntu Desktop Summit in May 2009. A new web application was employed to make release management easier, and a dedicated Transifex server was set up for Xfce translators. The project&#x27;s server and mirroring infrastructure was also upgraded, partly to cope with anticipated demand following the release announcement for 4.8.

Xfce 4.10, released 28 April 2012, introduced a vertical display mode for the panel and moved much of the documentation to an online wiki. The main focus of this release was on improving the user experience.
Xfce 4.12 was released on 28 February 2015, two years and ten months later, contrary to mass Internet speculation about the project being &quot;dead&quot;. The target of 4.12 was to improve user experience and take advantage of technologies introduced in the interim. New window manager features include an Alt+Tab dialog, and smart multi-monitor handling. Also, a new power management plugin for the panel&#x27;s notification area was introduced, as well as a re-written text editor and an enhanced file manager. Xfce 4.12 also started the transition to GTK 3 by porting application and supporting plugins and bookmarks. With 4.12, the project reiterated its commitment to Unix-like platforms other than Linux by featuring OpenBSD screenshots.

Xfce 4.13 is the development release during the transition of porting components to be fully GTK3-compatible, including xfce-panel and xfce-settings.

The planned release of Xfce 4.14 was announced in April 2016 and was officially released on 12 August 2019. The main goals of the release included porting the remaining core components from GTK 2 to GTK 3; replacing the dependency on with GDBus, GNOME&#x27;s implementation of the D-Bus specification; and removing deprecated widgets. Major features were postponed for a later 4.16 release. The minimum GTK 3 version was bumped from 3.14 to 3.22.

Xfce 4.16 was released on 22 December 2020. Some notable changes in this release include new icons with a more consistent color palette; improved interfaces for changing system settings; various panel improvements like animations for hiding, a new notification plugin with support for both legacy SysTray and modern StatusNotifier items, and better support for dark themes; and more information included in the About dialog.

Xfce 4.18 was released on 15 December 2022. This release mainly focused on new features and improvements to the Thunar file manager including an image preview sidebar, split view, recursive file searching, better mime type handling, per-file color highlighting, undoing up to 10 actions, a recently opened files location, restoring open tabs on startup, and a customizable toolbar. Other changes include a keyboard shortcut editor and merging the date and time plugins.

== Software components ==
Applications developed by the Xfce team are based on GTK and self-developed Xfce libraries. Other than Xfce itself, there are third-party programs which use the Xfce libraries.

=== Development framework ===
Xfce provides a development framework which contains the following components:

* exo, an application library for the Xfce desktop environment
* garcon, a Freedesktop.org compliant menu library
* libxfce4ui, a widgets library for the Xfce desktop environment
* libxfce4util, an extension library for Xfce

One of the services provided to applications by the framework is a red banner across the top of the window when the application is running with root privileges, warning the user that they could damage system files.

=== Xfce Panel ===
Xfce Panel is a highly configurable taskbar with a rich collection of plug-ins available for it.

Many aspects of the panel and its plug-ins can be configured easily through graphical dialogs, but also by GTK style properties and hidden Xfconf settings.

=== Xfce Terminal ===
A terminal emulator is provided as part of the Xfce project, but it can be used in other X Window System environments as well. It supports tabs, customizable key bindings, colors, and window sizes. It was designed to replace GNOME Terminal, which depends on the GNOME libraries. Like GNOME Terminal, though, it is based on the VTE library. Xfce Terminal can be configured to offer a varying background color for each tab. It can also be used as a drop-down terminal emulator, similar to Guake or Tilda.

=== Xfwm ===
Xfwm is a window manager, supporting custom themes. Starting with version 4.2, Xfwm integrates its own compositing manager.

=== Catfish ===
A file searching tool, able to perform in-name and in-text matching, as well searching by file type and last modified time. It is also capable of performing indexing by using an mlocate database.

=== Thunar ===
Thunar is the default file manager for Xfce, replacing Xffm. It resembles GNOME&#x27;s Nautilus, and is designed for speed and a low memory footprint, as well as being highly customizable through plugins. Xfce also has a lightweight archive manager called Xarchiver, but this is not part of the core Xfce 4.4.0. More recently, &quot;Squeeze&quot; has been started as an archive manager designed to integrate better into the Xfce desktop, and though no releases have been made since 2008, the git repository of squeeze has been active and this version is more feature-rich than the last stable release.

=== Orage ===
Starting with version 4.4, Xfcalendar was renamed to &quot;Orage&quot; (French for &quot;thunderstorm&quot;) and several features were added. Orage has alarms and uses the iCalendar format, making it compatible with many other calendar applications, e.g. vdirsyncer to sync via CalDAV. It also includes a panel clock plugin and an international clock application capable of simultaneously showing clocks from several different time zones. With Xfce 4.16, and the dropping of GTK2 support for panel plugins, orage was replaced with DateTime plugin.

=== Mousepad ===

Mousepad is the default text editor for Xfce in some Linux distributions, including Xubuntu. Mousepad aims to be an easy-to-use and fast editor, meant for quickly editing text files, not a software development environment or an editor with a large plugin ecosystem. It does offer tabbed files, syntax highlighting, parentheses matching and indentation features commonly found in software editors. It closely follows the GTK-system release cycle. It originated as a fork of Leafpad, was developed by Erik Harrison and Nick Schermer, but has since been rewritten from scratch.

=== Parole ===

&quot;Parole&quot; is a simple media player based on the GStreamer framework. It is designed with simplicity, speed and resource usage in mind, and is part of the Xfce Goodies and uses at least three libraries from the Xfce project (libxfce4ui, libxfce4util, and libxfconf).

It is similar to &quot;GNOME Videos&quot;, but it has some advantages and disadvantages compared to it:

;Advantages
* It has (X11/XShm/Xv) video output that provides a much higher frame rate than Clutter-based video output of GNOME Videos which relies upon OpenGL or OpenGL ES for rendering
* Traditional text-based playlist on the main window for both audio and video files which provides an easy and fast switch between the files and shows their time
* Audio visualization
* Showing a banner upon the videos that have multiple audio or subtitle files

;Disadvantages
* Lacks a mechanism to speed up or slow down the media playback
* Lacks many advanced features of GNOME Videos
* As of version 1.0.5 (2019–11) it cannot run under Wayland

=== Ristretto ===
An image viewer (supporting slideshow mode). Ristretto can operate on folders of images, and display their thumbnails in addition to the active image.

=== Xfburn ===
A CD/DVD optical disc authoring software. Starting with the 4.12 release of Xfce, Xfburn is also able to burn Blu-ray discs.

=== Xfce Screensaver ===
A screen saver and session-locking program first packaged with the 4.14 release of Xfce. It uses screensaver themes compatible with Xscreensaver. Although forked from MATE Screensaver, it depends only on Xfce libraries.

=== Table of Xfce 4 components ===
== Products and distributions using Xfce ==
Xfce is included as one of the graphical user interfaces on the Pandora handheld gaming system.

It is the default desktop environment in the following Linux distributions:

<doc id="69111" wikidata="Q1042294" url="?curid=69111" title="So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish">
<text>So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish is the fourth book of the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; &quot;trilogy of six books&quot; written by Douglas Adams. Its title is the message left by the dolphins when they departed Planet Earth just before it was demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass, as described in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. A song of the same name was featured in the 2005 film adaptation of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.

==Plot summary==
While hitchhiking through the galaxy, Arthur Dent is dropped off on a planet in a rainstorm. He appears to be in England on Earth, even though he had seen the planet destroyed by the Vogons. He has been gone for several years, but only a few months have passed on Earth. He hitches a lift with a man named Russell and his sister Fenchurch (nicknamed &quot;Fenny&quot;). Russell explains that Fenny, who is sitting in a drugged state in the back seat of the car, became delusional after worldwide mass hysteria, in which everyone hallucinated &quot;big yellow spaceships&quot; (the Vogon destructor ships that &quot;demolished&quot; the Earth). Arthur becomes curious about Fenchurch, but he is dropped off before he can ask more questions. Inside his inexplicably undamaged home, Arthur finds a gift-wrapped bowl inscribed with the words &quot;So long and thanks for all the fish&quot;, into which he puts his Babel Fish. Arthur thinks that Fenchurch is somehow connected to him and to the Earth&#x27;s destruction. He still has the ability to fly whenever he lets his thoughts wander.

Arthur puts his life in order, and then tries to find out more about Fenchurch. He happens to find her hitchhiking and picks her up. He obtains her phone number, but shortly thereafter loses it. He discovers her home by accident when he searches for the cave in which he had lived on prehistoric Earth; Fenchurch&#x27;s flat is built on the same spot. Arthur and Fenchurch find more circumstances connecting them. Fenchurch reveals that, moments before her &quot;hallucinations&quot;, she had an epiphany about how to make everything right, but then blacked out. She has not been able to recall the substance of the epiphany. Eventually discovering that Fenchurch&#x27;s feet do not touch the ground, Arthur teaches her how to fly. They have sex in the skies over London.

In her conversation with Arthur, Fenchurch learns about his adventures hitchhiking across the galaxy, and Arthur learns that all the dolphins disappeared shortly after the world hallucinations. Arthur and Fenchurch travel to California to see John Watson, an enigmatic scientist who claims to know why the dolphins disappeared. Watson has abandoned his original name in favour of &quot;Wonko the Sane&quot;, because he believes that the rest of the world&#x27;s population has gone mad. Watson shows them another bowl with the words &quot;So long and thanks for all the fish&quot; inscribed on it, and encourages them to listen to it. The bowl explains audibly that the dolphins, aware of the planet&#x27;s coming destruction, left Earth for an alternate dimension. Before leaving, they pulled the Earth from a parallel universe into this one and transported everyone and everything onto it from the one about to be destroyed. After the meeting, Fenchurch tells Arthur that, while he lost something and later found it, she found something and later lost it. She desires that they travel to space together, and that they reach the site where God&#x27;s Final Message to His Creation is written.

Ford Prefect discovers that the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; entry for Earth has been updated to include the volumes of text that he originally wrote, instead of the previous truncated entry, &quot;Mostly harmless&quot;. Curious, Ford hitchhikes across the galaxy to reach Earth. Eventually he uses the ship of a giant robot to land in the centre of London, causing a panic. In the chaos, Ford reunites with Arthur and the two of them and Fenchurch commandeer the robot&#x27;s ship. Arthur takes Fenchurch to the planet where God&#x27;s Final Message to His Creation is written, where they discover Marvin. Due to previous events, Marvin is now approximately 37 times older than the known age of the universe and is barely functional. With Arthur&#x27;s and Fenchurch&#x27;s help, Marvin reads the Message (&quot;We apologise for the inconvenience&quot;), utters the final words &quot;I think... I feel good about it&quot;, and dies happily.

==Style and themes==
The novel has a very different tone from the previous books in the series. It is a romance, and also moves around in time more erratically than its predecessors. It is set largely on Earth; Arthur only returns to outer space in the final chapters. The different tone also reflects the rushed nature of the writing; Adams&#x27;s editor Sonny Mehta moved in with him to ensure that the book met its deadline, which had been repeatedly extended. As a result, Adams later stated that he was not entirely happy with the book, which includes several jarring authorial intrusions, which his biographer Neil Gaiman described as &quot;patronising and unfair&quot;.

The book also reflects a significant shift in Adams&#x27;s view of computers. In the previous books, computers had been portrayed quite negatively, reflecting Adams&#x27;s views on the subject at the time. However, between the writing of &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot; and &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;, his attitude toward technology changed considerably. Having been taken to a computer fair, he became enamored of the first model of the Macintosh, the start of a long love affair with the brand (he claimed to have bought two of the first three Macs in the UK, the other being bought by his friend Stephen Fry). In &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;, Arthur Dent purchases an Apple computer for the purpose of star mapping in order to pinpoint the location of the cave he lived in on prehistoric Earth, and although Adams mocks Arthur&#x27;s methodology (noting that he really has no idea of how to go about such a task), the computer itself is not disparaged, and produces the correct result despite Arthur&#x27;s haphazard approach. In a later essay, Adams noted that some people had accused him of being a &quot;turncoat&quot; because of this change in his attitudes.

==Literary significance and reception==
In 1993, &quot;Library Journal&quot; said that &quot;So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish&quot; was &quot;filled with loopy humor and pretzel logic that makes Adams&#x27; writing so delightful&quot;. Betsy Shorb, reviewing for &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, said that &quot;the humor is still off-the-wall but more gentle than the other books. The plot is more straight forward and slightly less bizarre than its predecessors&quot;. Dave Langford reviewed &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #62, and stated that &quot;Sequelholism has drained Adams of his high-speed inventiveness which made him famous. No doubt he&#x27;ll agree with me all the way to the bank&quot;.

==Audiobook adaptations==
There have been three audiobook recordings of the novel. The first was an abridged edition, recorded in the mid-1980s by Stephen Moore, best known for playing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android in the radio series, LP adaptations and in the TV series. In 1990, Adams himself recorded an unabridged edition, later re-released by New Millennium Audio in the United States and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. In 2006, actor Martin Freeman, who had played Arthur Dent in the 2005 movie, recorded a new unabridged edition of the audiobook.

The Quandary Phase of the radio series is drawn from &quot;So Long and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;, but is not a direct audiobook reading.

==Dedication==
The dedication thanks, among others, &quot;Mogens and Andy and all at Huntsham Court for a number of unstable events&quot;. This refers to the then country hotel in Devon where Adams retreated in the summer of 1984 to work on the book but instead enjoyed drinking wine with the owners and Steve Meretzky who had joined him to work on the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; video game.

==In popular culture==
* In 1997, American punk rock band NOFX named their seventh studio album So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes in an obvious homage to this book.
* In 2018, American rock band A Perfect Circle released a song titled &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot; as a single off their album &quot;Eat the Elephant&quot;.

<text>Lindy John Remigino (June 3, 1931 – July 11, 2018) was an American track and field athlete, the 1952 Olympic 100 m champion.

==Life and career==
Remigino was born in Elmhurst, Queens, New York. He was named after aviator Charles Lindbergh. In 1952, while at Manhattan College he won the ICAAAA 220 championship, then placed close second to Morgan State&#x27;s sprinter, Art Bragg, at the United States Olympic Trials. The expected main American contender for the Olympic title, Jim Golliday, was injured and did not qualify. In Helsinki, one of the leading American sprinters, Art Bragg, was injured prior to the Games, leaving two Americans, Dean Smith and Remigino to qualify for the final.

Out of the blocks, John Treloar took a step ahead, but Remigino the eventual Olympic champion and several more quickly picked up his pace, with Jamaica&#x27;s Herb McKenley lagging well behind. By the 80 m mark, Remigino held a big lead: however, in his excitement at sight of the advancing tape, he pitched forward in a virtual lean. He therefore decelerated in the lean, and, as McKenley came quickly, at the tape no one was certain who won. The final was &quot;probably the closest mass finish in Olympic 100 metre history&quot; with the first four runners all clocking in at 10.4 seconds hand-timed (with the fifth and sixth runners only 0.1 behind in 10.5), all six finalists within 0.12 seconds electric-timed (10.79 for first, 10.91 for sixth), and a photo finish necessary to separate the winners. Across Europe that Summer, Remigino defeated McKenley several times more in the 100, while McKenley defeated the new &quot;World&#x27;s Fastest Human&quot; one time in the 200 m race. In Oslo, Norway, Remigino won in 10.2 s which would have equaled the 100-meters world-record, but an out of place wind-o-meter meant the time could not be ratified. His official best time was 10.4 s.

In 1953, Remigino won both ICAAAA sprint championships. In 1955 he placed second to Bobby Morrow in the 100 US Nationals.

Following his running career, Remigino became a coach at the Hartford High School in Connecticut.

Remingino died on July 11, 2018, at the age of 87.

<text>Eric Brighteyes is an epic Viking novel by H. Rider Haggard that concerns the adventures of its eponymous principal character in 10th-century Iceland. The novel was first published in 1891 by Longmans, Green &amp; Company. It was illustrated by Lancelot Speed.

==Plot Outline==
Eric Thorgrimursson, nicknamed &quot;Brighteyes&quot; for his most notable trait, strives to win the hand of his beloved, Gudruda the Fair. Her father Asmund, a priest of the old Norse gods, opposes the match, believing Eric to be a man without prospects. Deadlier by far are the intrigues of Swanhild, Gudruda&#x27;s half-sister and a sorceress, who desires Eric for herself. She persuades the chieftain Ospakar Blacktooth to woo Gudruda, making the two men enemies. Battles, intrigues, and treachery follow.

==Background==
Haggard wrote the book in late 1888, following a visit to Iceland.

==Pioneer of the Genre==
The novel was an early example (and Haggard&#x27;s introduction implies that it was the first) of modern efforts in English at pastiching saga literature. It clearly shows the influence of the pioneering saga translations by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson in the late 1860s.

Science fiction historian David Pringle has stated that &quot;Eric Brighteyes&quot;, with its outcast hero and emphasis on violent conflict, &quot;in many ways resembles a Sword &amp; Sorcery epic before its time&quot;.

==Reception==
Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas praised &quot;Eric Brighteyes&quot;, saying that &quot;nothing has been written in English that matches this complete comprehension of the blend of the fury and mysticism that was that greatest of anomalies, the Viking.&quot; Pamela Cleaver described &quot;Eric Brighteyes&quot; as the best of Haggard&#x27;s historical novels. She stated that &quot;there is a wonderful atmosphere with saga overtones in this doom-laden tale.&quot;

John Scarborough included &quot;Eric Brighteyes&quot; on a list of what he regarded as Haggard&#x27;s best novels, along with &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Nada the Lily&quot;, and &quot;Red Eve&quot;.

In The Stanley Kubrick Archive Oral History Project Web Video Series &quot;Finding and Developing the Story&quot;, Kubrick&#x27;s eldest daughter Katharina mentions the book as one that &quot;he was particularly interested in&quot;. Anthony Frewin states the book was &quot;very, very dear to him&quot; and claims that, &quot;had he lived, I&#x27;m sure he would have done it&quot; as a film.

==Publication==
The novel was republished by the Newcastle Publishing Company under the title The Saga of Eric Brighteyes as the second volume of the Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library series in March 1974, and first issued as a mass market paperback by Zebra Books in 1978.

==Sequel==
A sequel, &quot;Eric Brighteyes #2: A Witch&#x27;s Welcome&quot;, written by Sigfriour Skaldaspillir (the pseudonym of Mildred Downey Broxon) was published in 1979.

<text>Lancelot Speed (13 June 1860 – 31 December 1931) was a coastal painter and a British illustrator of books in the Victorian era, usually of a fantastical or romantic nature. He is probably most well known for his illustrations for Andrew Lang&#x27;s fairy story books. Speed is credited as the designer of the 1916 silent film version of the novel &quot;&quot; by H. Rider Haggard, which he illustrated.

==Early life==
Speed was born in London on 13 June 1860, the youngest son of William Speed, a Queen&#x27;s Counsel of the Middle Temple. He attended Rugby School. He was admitted to and matriculated from there in Easter 1881. He was admitted to Clare College, Cambridge, on 27 January 1881, matriculated that Easter, and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1885.

==Illustration==
Speed had no formal art training, but became an illustrator working primarily in black and white. Process engraving particularly suited his fine lines, and he was one of the earlier illustrators to benefit from the new technology.

He lived and worked at Southend-on-Sea, England in the latter part of his life.

==Films==

He was also the director of several early British silent films.

Lancelot Speed&#x27;s cartoon work is the source of the nickname for the colourful commander of the World War II Special Forces unit &quot;Popski&#x27;s Private Army&quot;. Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Peniakoff, DSO MC, a Belgian of White Russian descent, was called &quot;Popski&quot; by Bill Kennedy Shaw, the Intelligence Officer of the Long Range Desert Group because his signallers had trouble with the spelling of his surname. Peniakoff earned early notoriety (and his MC) with his behind-the-lines raids to blow up German petrol dumps, transported there and back, in some exasperation, by the LRDG.

In the &quot;Pip, Squeak and Wilfred&quot; adventures before the start of World War II, there were two hairy characters: one was a scheming, plotting, bomb-throwing Bolshevik, and the other was his dog. The mad Russian was called &quot;Professor Wtzkoffski&quot; and the dog was called &quot;Popski&quot;. These cartoon characters in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; were well known to all the soldiers, and in his best-selling book about his small irregular unit, &quot;Popski&quot; said, &quot;...I was delighted with my nickname...&quot;.

==Death==
Speed died at Deal, Kent on 31 December 1931 and was buried at Knowlton, Kent, England. His estate was valued at just over £265.

<doc id="69119" wikidata="Q1322143" url="?curid=69119" title="List of rivers of Europe">
<text>This article lists the principal rivers of Europe with their main tributaries.

==Scope==
The border of Europe and Asia is here defined as from the Kara Sea, along the Ural Mountains and Ural River to the Caspian Sea. While the crest of the Caucasus Mountains is the geographical border with Asia in the south, Georgia, and to a lesser extent Armenia and Azerbaijan, are politically and culturally often associated with Europe; rivers in these countries are therefore included.

The list is at the outset limited to those rivers that are at least 250 km long from the most distant source, have a drainage basin (catchment area, watershed) of at least , or have a mean discharge (volume, flow) of at least . Also included are a number of rivers (currently 47) that do not meet these criteria, but are very well known and/or nearly make the mark. Examples of these are the Arno, Ruhr, Saar, and Clyde. See the lists of rivers for individual countries linked to at the bottom of the page for smaller rivers.

The rivers are ordered from those flowing to the extreme northeast into the Arctic Ocean, following the coastline anticlockwise all the way to the southeastern coast of the Black Sea. Iceland and the British Islands are included via virtual connections with northern Norway and across the Strait of Dover and the North Channel, respectively. Finally, rivers draining into the Caspian Sea are listed from Azerbaijan to the Ural River.

The table can be sorted by each column. The first three columns give a ranking for (maximum) length, area and volume of those rivers flowing into the sea or an endorheic lake down to the cut-off values. No ranking of tributaries is attempted, as the concept is too contentious; for example, hydrologically the middle and upper Volga could be considered a tributary of the Kama, in which case it would be the fifth or sixth longest river in Europe. Instead it does not appear in the table at all.

The commercial and geopolitical importance of rivers is not ranked here. As a transportation artery, a river may unite a region commercially and economically, but major rivers, as barriers to travel, may also form political boundaries between states. The Danube, the second longest river in Europe, is notable for flowing through or past ten countries; the Rhine through or past six. The Volga, the longest river in Europe, unites a huge region of European Russia; eleven of the twenty largest cities in Russia lie on its banks. The Loire and the Po unite important regions within France and Italy respectively. The most important rivers in Europe include Rhone, Elbe, Oder, Tagus, Thames, Don and Dnieper, among others.

==Caveats==
The measurements shown are drawn from sources deemed most reliable, but still are often uncertain, especially when other sources disagree wildly. For example, the Siret in Romania and Ukraine is 726 km long with a basin of 44,000 km2 according to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 647 km (44,811 km2) according to a Romanian management plan for the Siret basin and 559 km (47,610 km2) according to the extensive transboundary rivers study by the Economic Commission for Europe.

Length estimates for rivers depend on a number of variables:
*River Source - The choice of the source obviously has an impact. Here we attempt to list the most distant source. When that involves a tributary nearer the mouth of the river, the length of the nominal river is listed as well, if it meets the above criteria.
*River End - Rivers flowing into estuaries have an arbitrary lower end. The channel of such a river through an estuary is usually included in the length when it is exposed at low tide.
*Path Granularity - The estimate will be larger when the curves of the river are traced at a smaller scale.
*Intermediate Bodies of Water - The length of a watercourse through a reservoir or lake is open to interpretation. For this table, when a source for the total length of a river system involving lakes is lacking, the shortest possible course through the lakes is used
*Path Changes - Over time, a river&#x27;s length can change through canalization, the creation of reservoirs, and natural changes in the water course.

The catchment areas are more consistent between sources. However, in low relief the watershed is less obvious, while underground connections (especially in karst systems) further complicate area measurements. Unless excellent sources are available, the areas below 70°N latitude are taken from the HydroBASINS project. The River Networks and Ramsar Sites Information Service websites provide convenient interfaces to assess the accuracy of many of the basins. Areas for rivers above 70°N are warned and found to be less reliable.

The listed multiyear mean discharges are even less reliable than the lengths. Underestimates are most common, as the gauging stations are often far above the mouth, so that only a fraction of the drainage basin is represented. On the other hand, the highest volume of a river may not be at the mouth due to water loss by human usage, diversion (e.g. through distributaries), evaporation, or underground drainage.

<text>The Forbidden City () is the imperial palace complex in the center of the Imperial City in Beijing, China. It was the residence of 24 Ming and Qing dynasty Emperors, and the center of political power in China for over 500 years from 1420 to 1924. The palace is now administered by the Palace Museum. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world. The Forbidden City is arguably the most famous palace in all of Chinese history, and is the largest preserved royal palace complex still standing in the world.

The Forbidden City was constructed from 1406 to 1420, and was the imperial palace and winter residence of the Emperor of China from the Ming dynasty (since the Yongle Emperor) to the end of the Qing dynasty, between 1420 and 1924. The Forbidden City served as the home of Chinese emperors and their households and was the ceremonial and political center of the Chinese government for over 500 years. Since 1925, the Forbidden City has been under the charge of the Palace Museum, whose extensive collection of artwork and artifacts was built upon the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987.

The complex claims to consist of 9,999 rooms in total, although experts have shown in recent years that the number only amounts to 8,886, covering /178-acre. The palace exemplifies the opulence of the residences of the Chinese emperor and the traditional Chinese palatial architecture, and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere. It is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world. Since 2012, the Forbidden City has seen an average of 14 million visitors annually, and received more than 19 million visitors in 2019. In 2018, the Forbidden City&#x27;s market value was estimated at US$70 billion, making it both the world&#x27;s most valuable palace and the most valuable piece of real estate anywhere in the world.

It was listed as the first batch of national key cultural relics in 1961. The palace is extremely important to the Chinese public and nation, who often view it as a cultural and heavenly link to their ancestors.

== Etymology ==
The palace gained its name from its enormous scale and severely restricted access to all but the Emperor, the Imperial family, and Eunuchs; hence the Chinese term &quot;Forbidden City&quot; emerged. The punishment for unauthorised entry to the palace was immediate execution. The common English name &quot;Forbidden City&quot; is a translation of the Chinese name &quot;Zijincheng&quot; (; ), which first formally appeared in 1576. Another English name of similar origin is &quot;Forbidden Palace,&quot; though &quot;city&quot; is much closer to the original Chinese meaning.

The name &quot;Zijincheng&quot; has significance on many levels. &quot;Zi&quot;, or &quot;purple&quot;, refers to the North Star, which in ancient China was called the &quot;Ziwei&quot; Star, and in traditional Chinese astrology was the heavenly abode of the Jade Emperor. The surrounding celestial region, the Ziwei Enclosure (), was the realm of the Jade Emperor and his family. The Forbidden City, as the residence of the terrestrial emperor, was its earthly counterpart. &quot;Jin&quot; refers to a prohibition or taboo. &quot;Cheng&quot; originally meant a castle, fortress, or fortification, but in modern Chinese, the character means city.

Today, the site is most commonly known in Chinese as &quot;Gugong&quot; (), which means the &quot;Former Palace&quot;. The museum which is based in these buildings is known as the &quot;Palace Museum&quot; ().

In the Ming and Qing dynasties, the Forbidden City was also known as &quot;Danei&quot; () or &quot;Palace City&quot; ().

== History ==


When the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s son Zhu Di became the Yongle Emperor, he moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing, and construction began in 1406 on what would become the Forbidden City.

Construction lasted 14 years and required more than a million workers. Material used include whole logs of precious &quot;Phoebe zhennan&quot; wood () found in the jungles of south-western China, and large blocks of marble from quarries near Beijing. The floors of major halls were paved with &quot;golden bricks&quot; (), specially baked paving bricks from Suzhou.

From 1420 to 1644, the Forbidden City was the seat of the Ming dynasty. In April 1644, it was captured by rebel forces led by Li Zicheng, who proclaimed himself emperor of the Shun dynasty. He soon fled before the combined armies of former Ming general Wu Sangui and Manchu forces, setting fire to parts of the Forbidden City in the process.

By October, the Manchus had achieved supremacy in northern China, and a ceremony was held at the Forbidden City to proclaim the young Shunzhi Emperor as ruler of all China under the Qing dynasty. The Qing rulers changed the names on some of the principal buildings to emphasise &quot;harmony&quot; rather than &quot;supremacy&quot;, made the nameplates bilingual (Chinese and Manchu), and introduced shamanist elements to the palace.

In 1860, during the Second Opium War, Anglo-French forces took control of the Forbidden City and occupied it until the end of the war. In 1900 Empress Dowager Cixi fled from the Forbidden City during the Boxer Rebellion, leaving it to be occupied by forces of the treaty powers until the following year.

After being the home of 24 emperors — 14 of the Ming dynasty and 10 of the Qing dynasty — the Forbidden City ceased being the political centre of China in 1912 with the abdication of Puyi, the last Emperor of China. Under an agreement with the new Republic of China government, Puyi remained in the Inner Court, while the Outer Court was given over to public use, until he was evicted after a coup in 1924. The Palace Museum was then established in the Forbidden City in 1925. In 1933, the Japanese invasion of China forced the evacuation of the national treasures in the Forbidden City. Part of the collection returned at the end of World War II, but the other part was evacuated to Taiwan in 1948 under orders of Chiang Kai-shek, whose Kuomintang was losing the Chinese Civil War. This relatively small but high quality collection was kept in storage until 1965, when it again became public as the core of the National Palace Museum in Taipei.

After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, some damage was done to the Forbidden City as the country was swept up in revolutionary zeal. During the Cultural Revolution, however, further destruction was prevented when Premier Zhou Enlai sent an army battalion to guard the city.

The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987 by UNESCO as the &quot;Imperial Palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties&quot;, due to its significant place in the development of Chinese architecture and culture.

In the early 21st century, the Palace Museum carried out a sixteen-year restoration project to repair and restore all buildings in the Forbidden City to their pre-1911 state, with the goal that 76% of the palace would be open to the public by 2020. As a result of that project, the Shoukang Palace was officially opened to the public in 2013, after initially being displayed in its original state. A sculpture museum was opened in the Cining Palace in 2015. Also opened in 2015 were the precincts around Cining Palace, the Yanyin Building and the Donghua Gate.

On the 5 November 2024, 100 years was marked since the expulsion of the last Emperor of China, Puyi, from the palace by republican forces, led by Feng Yuxiang.

== Structure ==

The Forbidden City is a rectangle, measuring from north to south and from east to west. It consists of 980 surviving buildings with 8,886 bays of rooms. A common myth states that there are 9,999 rooms including antechambers, based on oral tradition, but it is not supported by survey evidence. The layout of the Forbidden City protected the imperial code of ethics as a physical installation. The courtyard was built on a massive, luxurious scale but it has the appearance of an ordinary quadrangle courtyard. The Forbidden City was designed to be the centre of the ancient, walled city of Beijing. It is enclosed in a larger, walled area called the Imperial City. The Imperial City is, in turn, enclosed by the Inner City; to its south lies the Outer City.

The Forbidden City remains important in the civic scheme of Beijing. The central north–south axis remains the central axis of Beijing. This axis extends to the south through Tiananmen Gate to Tiananmen Square, the ceremonial centre of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and on to Yongdingmen Gate. To the north, it extends through Jingshan Park to the Drum Tower and Bell Tower. This axis is not exactly aligned north–south, but is tilted by slightly more than two degrees. Researchers now believe that the axis was designed during the Yuan dynasty to be aligned with Shangdu, the other capital of their empire.
=== Walls and gates ===

The Forbidden City is surrounded by a high city wall and a deep by wide moat. The walls are wide at the base, tapering to at the top. These walls served as both defensive walls and retaining walls for the palace. They were constructed with a rammed earth core, and surfaced with three layers of specially baked bricks on both sides, with the interstices filled with mortar.

At the four corners of the wall sit corner towers (E) with intricate roofs boasting 72 ridges, reproducing the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Yellow Crane Pavilion as they appeared in Song dynasty paintings. These towers are the most visible parts of the palace to people outside the walls, and much folklore is attached to them. According to one legend, artisans could not put a corner tower back together after it was dismantled for renovations in the early Qing dynasty, and it was only rebuilt after the intervention of carpenter-immortal Lu Ban.

The wall is pierced by a gate on each side. At the southern end is the main Meridian Gate (A) (). To the north is the Gate of Divine Prowess (B) (), which faces Jingshan Park. The east and west gates are the East Glorious Gate (D) () and the West Glorious Gate (C) (). All gates in the Forbidden City are decorated with nine-by-nine arrays of golden door nails, except for the East Glorious Gate, which has only eight.

The Meridian Gate has two protruding wings, which form three sides of a square before it, and five gateways. The central gateway is part of the Imperial Way, a stone flagged path that forms the central axis of the Forbidden City and the ancient city of Beijing itself, leading all the way from the Gate of China in the south to Jingshan Park in the north. Except for the empress on the occasion of her wedding and successful students after the Imperial Examination, only the emperor could walk or ride on the Imperial Way.

=== Outer Court or the Southern Section ===




Traditionally, the Forbidden City is divided into two parts: the Outer Court () or Front Court () to the south, which was used for ceremonial purposes; and the Inner Court () or Back Palace () to the north, which was the residence of the emperor and his family and was used for day-to-day affairs of state (the approximate dividing line shown as a red dash in the plan above). Generally, the Forbidden City has three vertical axes. The most important buildings are situated on the central north–south axis.

Entering from the Meridian Gate, one encounters a large square, pierced by the meandering Inner Golden Water River, which is crossed by five bridges. Beyond the square stands the Gate of Supreme Harmony (F) (). Behind that is a square from which a three-tiered white marble terrace rises and three halls stand on top of this terrace, the focus of the palace complex. From the south, these are the Hall of Supreme Harmony (), the Hall of Central Harmony (), and the Hall of Preserving Harmony ().

The Hall of Supreme Harmony (G) is the largest, and rises some above the level of the surrounding square. It is the ceremonial centre of imperial power, and the largest surviving wooden structure in China. It is nine bays wide and five bays deep, the numbers 9 and 5 being symbolically connected to the majesty of the emperor. Set into the ceiling at the centre of the hall is an intricate caisson decorated with a coiled dragon, from the mouth of which issues a chandelier-like set of metal balls, called the &quot;Xuanyuan Mirror&quot;. In the Ming dynasty, the emperor held court here to discuss affairs of state. During the Qing dynasty, as emperors held court far more frequently, a less ceremonious location was used instead, and the Hall of Supreme Harmony was only used for ceremonial purposes, such as enthronements, investitures, and imperial weddings.

The Hall of Central Harmony is a smaller, square hall, used by the emperor to prepare and rest before and during ceremonies. Behind it, the Hall of Preserving Harmony, was used for rehearsing ceremonies, and was also the site of the final stage of the Imperial Examination. All three halls feature imperial thrones, the largest and most elaborate one being that in the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

At the centre of the stairs leading up to the terraces from the northern and southern sides are ceremonial ramps, part of the Imperial Way, featuring elaborate and symbolic bas-relief carvings. The northern ramp, behind the Hall of Preserving Harmony, is carved from a single piece of stone long, wide, and thick. It weighs some 200 tons and is the largest such carving in China. The southern ramp, in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, is even longer, but is made from two stone slabs joined — the joint was ingeniously hidden using overlapping bas-relief carvings, and was only discovered when weathering widened the gap in the 20th century. The stone slabs were likely transported from a quarry via ice sledge along an ice path lubricated by well water en route.

In the southwest and southeast of the Outer Court are the halls of Military Eminence (H) and Literary Glory (J). The former was used at various times for the emperor to receive ministers and hold court, and later housed the palace&#x27;s own printing house. The latter was used for ceremonial lectures by highly regarded Confucian scholars, and later became the office of the Grand Secretariat. A copy of the &quot;Complete Library of the Four Treasuries&quot; was stored there. To the north-east are the Southern Three Places () (K), which was the residence of the crown prince.

=== Inner Court or the Northern Section ===
The Inner Court is separated from the Outer Court by an oblong courtyard lying orthogonal to the city&#x27;s main axis. It was the home of the Emperor and his family. In the Qing dynasty, the Emperor lived and worked almost exclusively in the Inner Court, with the Outer Court used only for ceremonial purposes.

==== Back Three Palaces ====
At the centre of the Inner Court is another set of three halls (L). From the south, these are:
*Palace of Heavenly Purity ()
*Hall of Union
*Palace of Earthly Tranquility
Smaller than the Outer Court halls, the three halls of the Inner Court were the official residences of the Emperor and the Empress. The Emperor, representing Yang and the Heavens, would occupy the Palace of Heavenly Purity. The Empress, representing Yin and the Earth, would occupy the Palace of Earthly Tranquility. In between them was the Hall of Union, where the Yin and Yang mixed to produce harmony.

The Palace of Heavenly Purity is a double-eaved building, and set on a single-level white marble platform. It is connected to the Gate of Heavenly Purity to its south by a raised walkway. In the Ming dynasty, it was the residence of the Emperor. However, beginning from the Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty, the Emperor lived instead at the smaller Hall of Mental Cultivation (N) to the west, out of respect to the memory of the Kangxi Emperor. The Palace of Heavenly Purity then became the Emperor&#x27;s audience hall. A caisson is set into the roof, featuring a coiled dragon. Above the throne hangs a tablet reading &quot;Justice and Honour&quot; ().

The Palace of Earthly Tranquility () is a double-eaved building, 9 bays wide and 3 bays deep. In the Ming dynasty, it was the residence of the Empress. In the Qing dynasty, large portions of the Palace were converted for Shamanist worship by the new Manchu rulers. From the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, the Empress moved out of the Palace. However, two rooms in the Palace of Earthly Harmony were retained for use on the Emperor&#x27;s wedding night.

Between these two palaces is the Hall of Union, which is square in shape with a pyramidal roof. Stored here are the 25 Imperial Seals of the Qing dynasty, as well as other ceremonial items.

Behind these three halls lies the Imperial Garden (M). Relatively small, and compact in design, the garden nevertheless contains several elaborate landscaping features. To the north of the garden is the Gate of Divine Might.

Directly to the west is the Hall of Mental Cultivation (N). Originally a minor palace, this became the &quot;de facto&quot; residence and office of the Emperor starting from Yongzheng. In the last decades of the Qing dynasty, empresses dowager, including Cixi, held court from the eastern partition of the hall. Located around the Hall of Mental Cultivation are the offices of the Grand Council and other key government bodies.

The north-eastern section of the Inner Court is taken up by the Palace of Tranquil Longevity () (O), a complex built by the Qianlong Emperor in anticipation of his retirement. It mirrors the set-up of the Forbidden City proper and features an &quot;outer court&quot;, an &quot;inner court&quot;, and gardens and temples. The entrance to the Palace of Tranquil Longevity is marked by a glazed-tile Nine Dragons Screen.

==== Six Western and Six Eastern Palaces ====
To the west and to the east of the three main halls of the inner court are the Six Western Palaces (西六宫; &quot;xīliùgōng&quot;) and the Six Eastern Palaces (东六宫; &quot;dōngliùgōng&quot;). These palaces were the residences of the imperial consorts. Six palaces lay to the west and six to the east of the three main halls, hence the name. The architecture of the twelve palaces, connected by passageways, is more or less the same. The Western and Eastern Palaces each have a layout of three palaces on either side of an alley that runs from north to south. Every palace has its own courtyards, main halls, and side-halls. The main halls stand in the middle and the side-halls are in the east and west. The front courtyard and its main hall was used for receptions, while the back courtyard and its main hall served as living quarters.

An imperial consort with the rank of concubine and above was given a residence in the main section of a palace and was the manager of that palace, an honor in itself. Lower ranking imperial consorts (noble ladies and below) lived in the side halls of the palaces and were supervised by the higher ranking imperial consort.

The twelve palaces were the place where many of the Qing emperors were born and grew up, and they formed the daily life of the imperial family.

During the late Qing era, Empress Dowager Cixi resided in one of the Western Palaces and became known as the &quot;western empress&quot;, while her co-regent Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an lived in one of the Eastern Palaces and was thus known as the &quot;eastern empress&quot;.

The names of the palaces were:

Western Six Palaces 
*Palace of Eternal Longevity (永寿宫; &quot;Yǒngshòugōng&quot;)
*Hall of the Supreme Principle (太极殿; &quot;Tàijídiàn&quot;)
*Palace of Eternal Spring (长春宫; &quot;Chǎngchūngōng&quot;)
*Palace of Earthly Honour (翊坤宫; &quot;Yìkūngōng&quot;)
* (储秀宫; &quot;Chǔxiùgōng&quot;)
*Palace of Universal Happiness (咸福宫; &quot;Xíanfúgōng&quot;)

Eastern Six Palaces
* (景仁宫; &quot;Jǐngréngōng&quot;)
*Palace of Heavenly Grace (承乾宫; &quot;Chéngqiángōng&quot;)
* (锺粹宫; &quot;Zhōngcuìgōng&quot;)
*Palace of Prolonging Happiness (延禧宫; &quot;Yánxǐgōng&quot;)
* (景阳宫; &quot;Jǐngyánggōng&quot;)
* (永和宫; &quot;Yǒnghégōng&quot;)

====Cining Palace and Shoukang Palace====
To the west of the Hall of Mental Cultivation (N) in the western area of the Inner Court is Cining Palace (Palace of Compassion and Tranquility) and Shoukang Palace (Palace of Longevity and Good Health). The palaces were the residences of widowed consorts of previous emperors. In accordance with feudal manners, emperors should not live with the wives of late emperors, so they lived in this separate area of the Inner Court. The Cining palace is bigger and older than Shoukang Palace which is located to the west of Cining Palace. To the south of Cining Palace is Cining garden.

=== Religion ===

Religion was an important part of life for the imperial court. In the Qing dynasty, the Palace of Earthly Harmony became a place of Manchu Shamanist ceremony. At the same time, the native Chinese Taoist religion continued to have an important role throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties. There were two Taoist shrines, one in the imperial garden and another in the central area of the Inner Court.

Another prevalent form of religion in the Qing dynasty palace was Buddhism. A number of temples and shrines were scattered throughout the Inner Court, including that of Tibetan Buddhism or Lamaism. Buddhist iconography also proliferated in the interior decorations of many buildings. Of these, the Pavilion of the Rain of Flowers is one of the most important. It housed a large number of Buddhist statues, icons, and mandalas, placed in ritualistic arrangements.

=== Surroundings ===


The palace complex is surrounded by numerous opulent imperial gardens and temples including the Zhongshan Park, the sacrificial Imperial Ancestral Temple, the Beihai Park, and the Jingshan Park.

The Forbidden City is surrounded on three sides by imperial gardens. To the north is Jingshan Park, also known as Prospect Hill, an artificial hill created from the soil excavated to build the moat and from nearby lakes.

To the west lies Zhongnanhai, a former royal garden centred on two connected lakes, which now serves as the central headquarters for the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. To the north-west lies Beihai Park, also centred on a lake connected to the southern two, and a popular royal park.

To the south of the Forbidden City were two important shrines – the Imperial Shrine of Family or the Imperial Ancestral Temple () and the Imperial Shrine of State or Beijing Shejitan (), where the Emperor would venerate the spirits of his ancestors and the spirit of the nation, respectively. Today, these are the Beijing Labouring People&#x27;s Cultural Hall and Zhongshan Park (commemorating Sun Yat-sen) respectively.

To the south, two nearly identical gatehouses stand along the main axis. They are the Upright Gate () and the more famous Tiananmen Gate, which is decorated with a portrait of Mao Zedong in the centre and two placards to the left and right: &quot;Long Live the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; () and &quot;Long live the Great Unity of the World&#x27;s Peoples&quot; (). The Tiananmen Gate connects the Forbidden City precinct with the modern, symbolic centre of the Chinese state, Tiananmen Square.

While development is now tightly controlled in the vicinity of the Forbidden City, throughout the past century uncontrolled and sometimes politically motivated demolition and reconstruction has changed the character of the areas surrounding the Forbidden City. Since 2000, the Beijing municipal government has worked to evict governmental and military institutions occupying some historical buildings, and has established a park around the remaining parts of the Imperial City wall. In 2004, an ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and the northern city area as a buffer zone for the Forbidden City. In 2005, the Imperial City and Beihai (as an extension item to the Summer Palace) were included in the shortlist for the next World Heritage Site in Beijing.

== Architecture ==

=== Symbolism ===

The design of the Forbidden City, from its overall layout to the smallest detail, was meticulously planned to reflect philosophical and religious principles, and above all to symbolize the majesty of Imperial power. Some noted examples of symbolic designs include:
*Yellow is the color of the Emperor. Thus almost all roofs in the Forbidden City bear yellow glazed tiles. There are only two exceptions. The library at the Pavilion of Literary Profundity () had black tiles because black was associated with water, and thus fire-prevention. Similarly, the Crown Prince&#x27;s residences have green tiles because green was associated with wood, and thus growth.
*The main halls of the Outer and Inner courts are all arranged in groups of three – the shape of the Qian trigram ☰, representing Heaven. The residences of the Inner Court on the other hand are arranged in clusters of six – the shape of the Kun trigram ☷, representing the Earth.
*The sloping ridges of building roofs are decorated with a line of statuettes led by a man riding a phoenix and followed by an imperial dragon. The number of statuettes represents the status of the building – a minor building might have three or five. The Hall of Supreme Harmony has ten, the only building in the country to be permitted this in Imperial times. As a result, its tenth statuette, called a &quot;Hangshi&quot;, or &quot;ranked tenth&quot; (), is also unique in the Forbidden City.
*The layout of buildings follows ancient customs laid down in the &quot;Classic of Rites&quot;. Thus, ancestral temples are in front of the palace. Storage areas are placed in the front part of the palace complex, and residences in the back.

== Collections ==

The collections of the Palace Museum are based on the Qing imperial collection, including paintings, ceramics, seals, steles, sculptures, inscribed wares, bronze wares and enamel objects. According to the latest audit, it has 1,862,690 pieces of art. In addition, the imperial libraries housed a large collection of rare books and historical documents, including government documents of the Ming and Qing dynasties, which has since been transferred to the First Historical Archives.

From 1933, the threat of Japanese invasion forced the evacuation of the most important parts of the Museum&#x27;s collection. After the end of World War II, this collection was returned to Nanjing. However, with the Communists&#x27; victory imminent in the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government decided to ship the pick of this collection to Taiwan. Of the 13,491 boxes of evacuated artefacts, 2,972 boxes are now housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. More than 8,000 boxes were returned to Beijing, but 2,221 boxes remain today in storage under the charge of the Nanjing Museum.

The Palace Museum holds 340,000 pieces of ceramics and porcelain. These include imperial collections from the Tang dynasty and the Song dynasty. It has close to 50,000 paintings, within which more than 400 date from before the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), which is the largest in China. Its bronze collection dates from the early Shang dynasty. Of the almost 10,000 pieces held, about 1,600 are inscribed items from the pre-Qin period (to 221 BC). A significant part of the collection is ceremonial bronzeware from the imperial court. The Palace Museum has one of the largest collections of mechanical timepieces of the 18th and 19th centuries in the world, with more than 1,000 pieces. The collection contains both Chinese- and foreign-made pieces. Chinese pieces came from the palace&#x27;s own workshops. Foreign pieces came from countries including Britain, France, Switzerland, the United States, and Japan. Of these, the largest portion come from Britain. Jade has a unique place in Chinese culture. The Museum&#x27;s collection includes some 30,000 pieces. The pre-Yuan dynasty part of the collection includes several pieces famed throughout history. The earliest pieces date from the Neolithic period. In addition to works of art, a large proportion of the Museum&#x27;s collection consists of the artifacts of the imperial court. This includes items used by the imperial family and the palace in daily life. This comprehensive collection preserves the daily life and ceremonial protocols of the imperial era.

== Influence ==
The Forbidden City has been influential in the subsequent development of Chinese architecture, as well as in providing inspiration for many artistic works.

=== Depiction in art, film, literature and popular culture ===
The Forbidden City has served as the scene to many works of fiction. In recent years, it has been depicted in films and television series. Some notable examples include:
*&quot;The Forbidden City&quot; (1918), a fiction film about a Chinese emperor and an American.
*&quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987), a biographical film about Puyi, was the first feature film ever authorised by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China to be filmed in the Forbidden City.
*&quot;Forbidden City Cop&quot; (1996), a Hong Kong wuxia comedy film about an imperial secret agent.
*&quot;Marco Polo&quot; (1982), a joint NBC and RAI miniseries filmed inside the Forbidden City. Note, however, that the present Forbidden City did not exist during the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, when Marco Polo met Kublai Khan.
*The 2003 real-time strategy game &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; depicts the Forbidden City as one of the great wonders of the world; in terms of game mechanics, it functions identically to a major city and provides additional resources to the player.
*The Forbidden City is a buildable Wonder in many different titles of the &quot;Civilization&quot; series of video games.
