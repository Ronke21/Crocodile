<text>The Battle of Worcester took place on 3 September 1651 in and around the city of Worcester, England and was the last major battle of the 1642 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms. A Parliamentarian army of around 28,000 under Oliver Cromwell defeated a largely Scottish Royalist force of 16,000 led by Charles II of England.

The Royalists took up defensive positions in and around the city of Worcester. The area of the battle was bisected by the River Severn, with the River Teme forming an additional obstacle to the south-west of Worcester. Cromwell divided his army into two main sections, divided by the Severn, in order to attack from both the east and south-west. There was fierce fighting at river crossing points and two dangerous sorties by the Royalists against the eastern Parliamentary force were beaten back. Following the storming of a major redoubt to the east of the city, the Parliamentarians entered Worcester and organised Royalist resistance collapsed. Charles II was able to escape capture.

==Background==
===Invasion of England===
The King was aided by Scottish allies and was attempting to regain the throne that had been lost when his father Charles I was executed. The commander of the Scots, David Leslie, supported the plan of fighting in Scotland, where royal support was strongest. Charles, however, insisted on making war in England. He calculated that Cromwell&#x27;s campaign north of the River Forth would allow the main Scottish Royalist army which was south of the Forth to steal the march on the Roundhead New Model Army in a race to London. He hoped to rally not merely the old faithful Royalists, but also the overwhelming numerical strength of the English Presbyterians to his standard. He calculated that his alliance with the Scottish Presbyterian Covenanters and his signing of the Solemn League and Covenant would encourage English Presbyterians to support him against the English Independent faction which had grown in power over the last few years. The Royalist army was kept well in hand, no excesses were allowed, and in a week the Royalists covered 150 miles in marked contrast to the Duke of Hamilton&#x27;s ill-fated expedition of 1648. On 8 August the troops were given a well-earned rest between Penrith and Kendal.

However the Royalists were mistaken in supposing that the enemy was unaware. Everything had been foreseen both by Cromwell and by the Council of State in Westminster. The latter had called out the greater part of the militia on 7 August. Lieutenant-General Charles Fleetwood began to draw together the midland contingents at Banbury. The London trained-bands turned out for field service no fewer than 14,000 strong. Every suspected Royalist was closely watched, and the magazines of arms in the country-houses of the gentry were for the most part removed into the strong places. On his part Cromwell had quietly made his preparations. Perth passed into his hands on 2 August and he brought back his army to Leith by 5 August. Thence he dispatched Lieutenant-General John Lambert with a cavalry corps to harass the invaders. Major-General Thomas Harrison was already at Newcastle picking the best of the county mounted-troops to add to his own regulars. On 9 August, Charles was at Kendal, Lambert hovering in his rear, and Harrison marching swiftly to bar his way at the Mersey. Thomas Fairfax emerged for a moment from his retirement to organize the Yorkshire levies, and the best of these as well as of the Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire militias were directed upon Warrington, which Harrison reached on 15 August, a few hours in front of Charles&#x27;s advanced guard. Lambert too, slipping round the left flank of the enemy, joined Harrison, and the English fell back (16 August), slowly and without letting themselves be drawn into a fight, along the London road.

===Worcester campaign===

Cromwell meanwhile, leaving George Monck with the least efficient regiments to carry on the war in Scotland, had reached the river Tyne in seven days, and thence, marching 20 miles a day in extreme heat with the country people carrying their arms and equipment, the regulars entered Ferrybridge on 19 August, at which date Lambert, Harrison and the north-western militia were about Congleton. It seemed probable that a great battle would take place between Lichfield and Coventry on or just after 25 August and that Cromwell, Harrison, Lambert and Fleetwood would all take part in it but the scene and the date of the denouement were changed by the Royalists&#x27; movements. Shortly after leaving Warrington the young king had resolved to abandon the direct march on London and to make for the Severn valley, where his father had found the most constant and the most numerous adherents in the first war, and which had been the centre of gravity of the English Royalist movement of 1648.

Sir Edward Massey, formerly the Parliamentary governor of Gloucester, was now with Charles, and it was hoped that he would induce his fellow Presbyterians to take arms. The military quality of the Welsh border Royalists was well proved, that of the Gloucestershire Presbyterians not less so, and, in basing himself on Gloucester and Worcester as his father had done on Oxford, Charles II hoped, naturally, to deal with the Independent faction minority of the English people more effectually than Charles I had earlier dealt with the majority of the people of England who had supported the Parliamentary cause. However the pure Royalism which now ruled in the invading army could not alter the fact that it was a foreign, Scottish, army, and it was not merely an Independent faction but all England that united against it.

Charles arrived at Worcester on 22 August and spent five days in resting the troops, preparing for further operations, and gathering and arming the few recruits who came in. The delay was to prove fatal; it was a necessity of the case foreseen and accepted when the march to Worcester had been decided upon, and had the other course, that of marching on London via Lichfield, been taken the battle would have been fought three days earlier with the same result. Worcester itself had no particular claim to being loyal to the King. Throughout the First Civil War it had taken the pragmatic position of declaring loyalty to whichever side had been in occupation. The epithet &#x27;Faithful City&#x27; arose out of a cynical (and unsuccessful) claim at the Restoration for compensation from the new king.
Cromwell, the lord general, had during his march south thrown out successively two flying columns under Colonel Robert Lilburne to deal with the Lancashire Royalists under the Earl of Derby. Lilburne entirely routed a Lancashire detachment of the enemy on their way to join the main Royalist army at the Battle of Wigan Lane on 25 August and as affairs turned out Cromwell merely shifted the area of his concentration two marches to the south-west, to Evesham. Early on 28 August, Lambert&#x27;s brigade made a surprise crossing of the Severn at Upton, 6 miles below Worcester. In the action which followed Massey was severely wounded and he and his men were forced to retreat northwards along the west bank of the Severn towards the river Teme and Worcester. Fleetwood followed Lambert with reinforcements and orders to advance north towards the Teme. This western envelopment severed the Royalists&#x27; lines of communications to Wales and the western counties of England. The Royalists were now only 16,000 strong with no hope of significant reinforcements and disheartened by the apathy with which they had been received in districts formerly all their own. Cromwell, for the only time in his military career, had a two-to-one numerical superiority.

On 30 August Cromwell delayed the start of the battle to give time for two pontoon bridges to be constructed, one over the Severn and the other over the Teme, close to their confluence. The delay allowed Cromwell to launch his attack on 3 September, one year to the day since his victory at the Battle of Dunbar.

==Battle==
Cromwell took his measures deliberately. Lilburne from Lancashire and Major Mercer with the Worcestershire horse were to secure Bewdley Bridge, north of Worcester and on the enemy&#x27;s line of retreat. Fleetwood was to force his way across the Teme and attack St John&#x27;s, the western suburb of Worcester. While Lambert commanded the eastern flank of the army which would advance and encircle the eastern walls of Worcester, Cromwell would lead the attack on the southern ramparts of the city.

The assault started on the morning of 3 September and initially the initiative lay with the Parliamentarians. Fleetwood forced the passage of the Teme over the pontoon bridges against Royalists under the command of Major General Montgomery. Colonel Richard Deane&#x27;s initial attempts to cross the Powick Bridge (where Prince Rupert of the Rhine had won the Battle of Powick Bridge, his first victory, in 1642) failed against stubborn resistance by the Royalists (many of whom were Scottish Highlanders) commanded by Colonel Keith. By force of arms and numbers, the Royalist army was pushed backward by the New Model Army with Cromwell on the eastern bank of the Severn and Fleetwood on the western sweeping in a semicircle long up toward Worcester.

The Royalists contested every hedgerow around Powick meadows. This stubborn resistance on the west bank of the Severn north of the Teme was becoming a serious problem for the Parliamentarians, so Cromwell led Parliamentary reinforcements from the eastern side of the town over the Severn pontoon bridge to aid Fleetwood. Charles II, from his vantage point on top of Worcester Cathedral&#x27;s tower, realised that an opportunity existed to attack the now-exposed eastern flank of the Parliamentary army. As the defenders on the Western side of the city retreated in good order into the city (although during this manoeuvre Keith was captured and Montgomery was badly wounded), Charles ordered two sorties to attack the Parliamentary forces east of the city. The north-eastern sortie through St Martin&#x27;s Gate was commanded by the Duke of Hamilton and attacked the Parliamentary lines at Perry Wood. The south-eastern one through Sidbury Gate was led by Charles II and attacked Red Hill. The Royalist cavalry under the command of David Leslie that was gathered on Pitchcroft meadow on the northern side of the city did not receive orders to aid the sorties and Leslie chose not to do so under his own initiative. Cromwell seeing the difficulty that his east flank was under rushed back over the Severn pontoon bridge with three brigades of troops to reinforce the flank.

Although they were pushed back, the Parliamentarians under Lambert were too numerous and experienced to be defeated by such a move. For an hour, the Parliamentarians retreated before the unexpected attack. However, following their reinforcement by Cromwell&#x27;s three brigades, they reversed the situation and drove the Royalists back toward the city. The Royalist retreat turned into a rout in which Parliamentarian and Royalist forces intermingled and skirmished up to and into the city. The Royalist position became untenable when the Essex militia stormed and captured Fort Royal, (a redoubt on a small hill to the south-east of Worcester overlooking the Sidbury gate), turning the Royalist guns to fire on Worcester.

Once in the city, Charles II removed his armour and found a fresh mount; he attempted to rally his troops but it was to no avail. A desperate Royalist cavalry charge down Sidbury Street and High Street, led by the Earl of Cleveland and Major Careless amongst others, allowed King Charles to escape the city by St Martin&#x27;s Gate. This cavalry force was composed of the few Midland English Royalists who had rallied to Charles II, and largely consisted of Lord Talbot&#x27;s troop of horse.

The defences of the city were stormed from three different directions as darkness came on, regulars and militia fighting with equal gallantry. Most of the few thousands of the Royalists who escaped during the night were easily captured by Lilburne and Mercer, or by the militia which watched every road in Yorkshire and Lancashire. Even the country people brought in scores of prisoners, for the Royalist officers and men alike, stunned by the suddenness of the disaster, offered no resistance.

==Aftermath==

About 3,000 men were killed during the battle and a further 10,000 were taken prisoner at Worcester or soon afterwards. The Earl of Derby was executed, while the other English prisoners were conscripted into the New Model Army and sent to Ireland. Around 8,000 Scottish prisoners were deported to New England, Bermuda, and the West Indies to work for landowners as indentured labourers, or else to work on fen drainage. Around 1,200 &quot;Scotch prisoners&quot; were taken to London; many died from disease and starvation at Tothill Fields and other makeshift prison camps. Parliamentary casualties numbered in the low hundreds.
The escape of Charles II included various incidents, including one of his hiding from a Parliamentarian patrol in an oak tree in the grounds of Boscobel House. He reached the south coast of England, and at Shoreham found transport to take him to safety in France. In announcing the Worcester victory of the day earlier, Cromwell&#x27;s 4 September despatch to William Lenthall, the Speaker of the House of Commons, has become famous: &quot;The dimensions of this mercy are above my thoughts. It is, for aught I know, a crowning mercy&quot;. Hence, Cromwell thought the victory was the greatest of all the favours, or mercies, given to him by God. The expression &quot;crowning mercy&quot; is frequently linked to the battle as it heralded the end of the English Civil War by completely destroying the last major Royalist army.

The Parliamentary militia were sent home within a week. Cromwell, who had ridiculed &quot;such stuff&quot; six months ago, knew them better now. &quot;Your new raised forces&quot;, he wrote to the Rump Parliament, &quot;did perform singular good service, for which they deserve a very high estimation and acknowledgement&quot;. The New England preacher Hugh Peters gave the militia a rousing farewell sermon &quot;when their wives and children should ask them where they had been and what news, they should say they had been at Worcester, where England&#x27;s sorrows began, and where they were happily ended&quot;, referring to the first clash of the Royalist and Parliamentarian Armies at the Battle of Powick Bridge on 23 September 1642, almost exactly nine years before. Prior to the battle King Charles II contracted the Worcester Clothiers Company to outfit his army with uniforms but was unable to pay the £453.3s bill. In June 2008 Charles, Prince of Wales paid off the 357-year-old debt (less the interest, which would have amounted to around £47,500.)

==Battle analysis==
Cromwell&#x27;s plan of battle divided his army into three parts, each part having a specific target: Colonel Robert Lilburne from Lancashire and Major Mercer with the Worcestershire horse were to secure Bewdley Bridge on the enemy&#x27;s line of retreat. Lambert and Fleetwood were to force their way across the Teme and attack St John&#x27;s, the western suburb of Worcester. Cromwell himself and the main army were to attack the town itself.

This plan was executed, and was the prototype of the Battle of Sedan. Worcester resembled Sedan in much more than outward form. Both were fought by &quot;nations in arms&quot;, by citizen soldiers who had their hearts in the struggle, and could be trusted not only to fight their hardest but to march their best. Only with such troops would a general dare to place a deep river between the two halves of his army or to send away detachments beforehand to reap the fruits of victory, in certain anticipation of winning the victory with the remainder. The result was, in brief, one of those rare victories in which a pursuit is superfluous.

==Legacy==
In early April 1786, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson visited Fort Royal Hill at the battlefield at Worcester. John Adams wrote that he was &quot;deeply moved&quot; but disappointed at the locals&#x27; lack of knowledge of the battle, and gave the townspeople an &quot;impromptu lecture&quot;,

<text>The duodenum is the first section of the small intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. In mammals, it may be the principal site for iron absorption.
The duodenum precedes the jejunum and ileum and is the shortest part of the small intestine.

In human beings, the duodenum is a hollow jointed tube about long connecting the stomach to the middle part of the small intestine. It begins with the duodenal bulb and ends at the suspensory muscle of duodenum. The duodenum can be divided into four parts: the first (superior), the second (descending), the third (transverse) and the fourth (ascending) parts.

The duodenum is the first section of the small intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear, and the terms anterior intestine or proximal intestine may be used instead of duodenum. In mammals the duodenum may be the principal site for iron absorption.

In humans, the duodenum is a C-shaped hollow jointed tube, in length, lying adjacent to the stomach (and connecting it to the small intestine). It is divided anatomically into four sections. The first part lies within the peritoneum but its other parts are retroperitoneal.

===Parts===
The &quot;first part&quot;, or &quot;superior part&quot;, of the duodenum is a continuation from the pylorus to the transpyloric plane. It is superior (above) to the rest of the segments, at the vertebral level of L1. The duodenal bulb, about long, is the first part of the duodenum and is slightly dilated. The duodenal bulb is a remnant of the mesoduodenum, a mesentery that suspends the organ from the posterior abdominal wall in fetal life. The first part of the duodenum is mobile, and connected to the liver by the hepatoduodenal ligament of the lesser omentum. The first part of the duodenum ends at the corner, the &quot;superior duodenal flexure&quot;.

Relations:
* Anterior
** Gallbladder
** Quadrate lobe of liver
* Posterior
** Bile duct
** Gastroduodenal artery
** Portal vein
** Inferior vena cava
** Head of pancreas
* Superior
** Neck of gallbladder
** Hepatoduodenal ligament (lesser omentum)
* Inferior
** Neck of pancreas
** Greater omentum
** Head of pancreas
The &quot;second part&quot;, or &quot;descending part&quot;, of the duodenum begins at the superior duodenal flexure. It goes inferior to the lower border of vertebral body L3, before making a sharp turn medially into the &quot;inferior duodenal flexure&quot;, the end of the descending part.

The pancreatic duct and common bile duct enter the descending duodenum, through the major duodenal papilla. The second part of the duodenum also contains the minor duodenal papilla, the entrance for the accessory pancreatic duct. The junction between the embryological foregut and midgut lies just below the major duodenal papilla.

The &quot;third part&quot;, or &quot;horizontal part&quot; or &quot;inferior part&quot; of the duodenum is 10~12 cm in length. It begins at the &quot;inferior duodenal flexure&quot; and passes transversely to the left, passing in front of the inferior vena cava, abdominal aorta and the vertebral column. The superior mesenteric artery and vein are anterior to the third part of the duodenum. This part may be compressed between the aorta and SMA causing superior mesenteric artery syndrome.

The &quot;fourth part&quot;, or &quot;ascending part&quot;, of the duodenum passes upward, joining with the jejunum at the duodenojejunal flexure. The fourth part of the duodenum is at the vertebral level L3, and may pass directly on top, or slightly to the left, of the aorta.

===Blood supply===
The duodenum receives arterial blood from two different sources. The transition between these sources is important as it demarcates the foregut from the midgut. Proximal to the 2nd part of the duodenum (approximately at the major duodenal papilla – where the bile duct enters) the arterial supply is from the gastroduodenal artery and its branch the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. Distal to this point (the midgut) the arterial supply is from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and its branch the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery supplies the 3rd and 4th sections.
The superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (from the gastroduodenal artery and SMA respectively) form an anastomotic loop between the celiac trunk and the SMA; so there is potential for collateral circulation here.

The venous drainage of the duodenum follows the arteries. Ultimately these veins drain into the portal system, either directly or indirectly through the splenic or superior mesenteric vein and then to the portal vein.

===Lymphatic drainage===
The lymphatic vessels follow the arteries in a retrograde fashion. The anterior lymphatic vessels drain into the pancreatoduodenal lymph nodes located along the superior and inferior pancreatoduodenal arteries and then into the pyloric lymph nodes (along the gastroduodenal artery). The posterior lymphatic vessels pass posterior to the head of the pancreas and drain into the superior mesenteric lymph nodes. Efferent lymphatic vessels from the duodenal lymph nodes ultimately pass into the celiac lymph nodes.

===Histology===
Under microscopy, the duodenum has a villous mucosa. This is distinct from the mucosa of the pylorus, which directly joins the duodenum. Like other structures of the gastrointestinal tract, the duodenum has a mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, and adventitia. Glands line the duodenum, known as Brunner&#x27;s glands, which secrete mucus and bicarbonate in order to neutralise stomach acids. These are distinct glands not found in the ileum or jejunum, the other parts of the small intestine.
===Variation===
The duodenum&#x27;s close anatomical association with the pancreas creates differences in function based on the position and orientation of the organs. The congenital abnormality, annular pancreas, causes a portion of the pancreas to encircle the duodenum. In an extramural annular pancreas, the pancreatic duct encircles the duodenum which results in gastrointestinal obstruction. An intramural annular pancreas is characterized by pancreatic tissue that is fused with the duodenal wall, causing duodenal ulceration.

===Gene and protein expression===

About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal duodenum. Some 300 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the duodenum with very few genes expressed only in the duodenum. The corresponding specific proteins are expressed in the duodenal mucosa, and many of these are also expressed in the small intestine, such as alanine aminopeptidase, a digestive enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme, involved in controlling blood pressure, and RBP2, a protein involved in the uptake of vitamin A.

==Function==
The duodenum is largely responsible for the breakdown of food in the small intestine, using enzymes. The duodenum also regulates the rate of emptying of the stomach via hormonal pathways. Secretin and cholecystokinin are released from cells in the duodenal epithelium in response to acidic and fatty stimuli present there when the pylorus opens and emits gastric chyme into the duodenum for further digestion. These cause the liver and gallbladder to release bile, and the pancreas to release bicarbonate and digestive enzymes such as trypsin, lipase and amylase into the duodenum as they are needed.

The duodenum is a critical contributor to the regulation of food intake and glycemic control. As the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum is the initial site of nutrient absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. The duodenum senses nutrient intake and composition, and signals to the liver, pancreas, adipose tissue and brain through the direct and indirect release of several key hormones and signaling molecules, including the incretin peptides Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), as well as Cholecystokinin (CCK) and Secretin.  The duodenum also signals to the brain directly via vagal afferents enabling neural control over food intake and glycemia.  Intestinal secretion of GIP and GLP-1 stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells, known as the incretin effect. Incretin peptides, principally GLP-1 and GIP, regulate islet hormone secretion, glucose concentrations, lipid metabolism, gut motility, appetite and body weight, and immune function.

The villi of the duodenum have a leafy-looking appearance, which is a histologically identifiable structure. Brunner&#x27;s glands, which secrete mucus, are only found in the duodenum. The duodenum wall consists of a very thin layer of cells that form the muscularis mucosae.

==Clinical significance==
===Ulceration===
Ulcers of the duodenum commonly occur because of infection by the bacteria &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;. These bacteria, through a number of mechanisms, erode the protective mucosa of the duodenum, predisposing it to damage from gastric acids. The first part of the duodenum is the most common location of ulcers since it is where the acidic chyme meets the duodenal mucosa before mixing with the alkaline secretions of the duodenum. Duodenal ulcers may cause recurrent abdominal pain and dyspepsia, and are often investigated using a urea breath test to test for the bacteria, and endoscopy to confirm ulceration and take a biopsy. If managed, these are often managed through antibiotics that aim to eradicate the bacteria, and proton-pump inhibitors and antacids to reduce the gastric acidity.

===Celiac disease===
The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines specify that a duodenal biopsy is required for the diagnosis of adult celiac disease. The biopsy is ideally performed at a moment when the patient is on a gluten-containing diet.

===Cancer===
Duodenal cancer is a cancer in the first section of the small intestine. Cancer of the duodenum is relatively rare compared to stomach cancer and colorectal cancer; malignant tumors in the duodenum constitute only around 0.3% of all the gastrointestinal tract tumors but around half of cancerous tissues that develop in the small intestine. Its histology is often observed to be adenocarcinoma, meaning that the cancerous tissue arises from glandular cells in the epithelial tissue lining the duodenum.

=== Obesity and Diabetes ===
A western diet induces duodenal mucosal hyperplasia and dysfunction that underlie insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Diet-induced duodenal mucosal hyperplasia consists of increased mucosal mass, increased villus length, decreased crypt density, proliferation of enteroendocrine cells, increased enterocyte mass, and an accumulation of lipid droplets in the mucosa. Diet induced duodenal dysfunction includes increased duodenal nutrient absorption, altered duodenal hormone secretion, and altered intestinal vagal afferent neuronal function.

=== Inflammation ===
Inflammation of the duodenum is referred to as duodenitis. There are multiple known causes. Celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease are two of the known causes.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;duodenum&quot; is Medieval Latin, short for &quot;intestīnum duodēnum digitōrum&quot;, meaning &quot;intestine of twelve finger-widths (in length)&quot;, genitive of &quot;duodēnī&quot;, &quot;twelve each&quot;, (related to &quot;duodecim&quot; &quot;twelve&quot;). Coined by Gerard of Cremona (d. 1187) in his Latin translation of &quot;Canon Avicennae&quot;, &quot;اثنا عشر&quot; itself a loan-translation of Greek dodekadaktylon (δωδεκάδάκτυλον), literally &quot;twelve fingers long&quot;. The intestine part was so called by the Greek physician Herophilus (c. 335–280 BCE) for its length, about equal to the breadth of 12 fingers.

Many languages use calques for this word. For example, German , Dutch and Turkish .

<text>Highgate Cemetery is a place of burial in North London, England, designed by architect Stephen Geary. There are approximately 170,000 people buried in around 53,000 graves across the West and East sides. Highgate Cemetery is notable both for some of the people buried there as well as for its &quot;de facto&quot; status as a nature reserve. The Cemetery is designated Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==Location==
The cemetery is in Highgate N6, next to Waterlow Park, in the London Borough of Camden. It comprises two sides, on either side of Swain&#x27;s Lane. The main gate is on Swain&#x27;s Lane, just north of Oakshott Avenue. There is another, disused, gate on Chester Road. The nearest public transport (Transport for London) is the C11 bus, Brookfield Park stop, and Archway tube station.

==History and setting==
The cemetery in its original formthe northwestern wooded areaopened in 1839, as part of a plan to provide seven large, modern cemeteries, now known as the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot;, around the outside of central London. The inner-city cemeteries, mostly the graveyards attached to individual churches, had long been unable to cope with the number of burials and were seen as a hazard to health and an undignified way to treat the dead. The initial design was by architect and entrepreneur Stephen Geary.

On 20 May 1839, Highgate (West) Cemetery was dedicated to St. James by the Right Reverend Charles James Blomfield, Lord Bishop of London. were consecrated for the use of the Church of England, and two acres were set aside for dissenters. Rights of burial were sold either for a limited period or in perpetuity. The first burial was Elizabeth Jackson of Little Windmill Street, Soho, on 26 May.

Highgate, like the others of the Magnificent Seven, soon became a fashionable place for burials and was much admired and visited. The Victorian attitude to death and its presentation led to the creation of a wealth of Gothic tombs and buildings. It occupies a spectacular south-facing hillside site slightly downhill from the top of Highgate hill, next to Waterlow Park. In 1854 a further 19 acres (8 ha) to the south east of the original area, across Swain&#x27;s Lane, was bought to form the eastern extension; this opened in 1860. Both sides of the cemetery are still used today for burials.

The cemetery&#x27;s grounds are full of trees, shrubbery, and wildflowers, most of which have been planted and grown without human influence. The grounds are a haven for birds and small animals, such as foxes. The cemetery is now owned and maintained by a charitable trust, the Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust, which was set up in 1975 and acquired the freehold of both East and West sides by 1981. In 1984 it published &quot;Highgate Cemetery: Victorian Valhalla&quot; by John Gay.

<doc id="70193" wikidata="Q103930" url="?curid=70193" title="List of cities and towns in Poland">
<text>This is a list of cities and towns in Poland, consisting of four sections: the full list of all 107 cities in Poland by size, followed by a description of the principal metropolitan areas of the country, the table of the most populated cities and towns in Poland, and finally, the full alphabetical list of all 107 Polish cities and 861 towns combined. 

As of 30 April 2022, there are altogether 2471 municipalities (gmina) in Poland:
* 1513 of them are rural gminas containing exclusively rural areas, each of them forms a part of one of the 314 regular powiats, but never as its seat,
* the remaining 968 contain a locality classified either as a city or a town, among them:
** 666 towns are managed together with their rural surroundings under a single local government in the form of an eponymous urban-rural gmina typically seated in such town (though not always; currently, Gmina Nowe Skalmierzyce is the only urban-rural gmina seated elsewhere than in the town); such mixed municipalities always form part of a regular powiat, sometimes seated in such town, in such case being usually an eponymous one (though there are some exceptions; e.g. Warsaw West County is seated in the town Ożarów Mazowiecki while Gdańsk County is seated in the town Pruszcz Gdański, although their names would suggest otherwise; in addition, two binominal &quot;hyphen&quot; counties seated in such towns have been named so due to long-established animosity between a pair of towns similar in size, in order to placate both competing populations, namely Strzelce-Drezdenko County and Ropczyce-Sędziszów County; finally, the mountainuous Bieszczady County has been named after the mountain range rather than its seat)
** 302 cities and towns are standalone as an urban gmina; nevertheless some of them be also a seat of an eponymous rural gmina surrounding it (the latter thus being often doughnut-shaped), despite not being a part of its territory; 
*** 195 standalone towns, each of them forming a part of a regular powiat and sometimes being its seat, in the latter case usually an eponymous one, though there are three exceptions (two of them are binominal &quot;hyphen&quot; counties, with Czarnków-Trzcianka County named so due to a long-established animosity between a pair of towns similar in size, while Bieruń-Lędziny County acquired its name when the decision was taken to have its seat relocated from its original location in Tychy, a city with powiat rights, to one of these two conpeting towns; the third exception is the mountainuous Tatra County named after the mountain range rather than its seat)
*** 107 cities (governed by a city mayor or &quot;prezydent miasta&quot;), among them:
**** 41 cities form along with two or more other municipalities an eponymous regular powiat, seated always in the city
**** 66 cities hold status of a city with powiat rights (an independent city) which is an urban gmina operating also as a powiat in its own right within a voivodeship; nevertheless, it may be also a seat of a regular powiat, in such case usually an eponymous one (with two exceptions, namely the Łódź East County bearing the additional designation &quot;East&quot; because of bordering the city only to the west, as well as the mountainuous Karkonosze County seated in Jelenia Góra but named after the mountain range rather than its seat) despite not being included in the territory of the county (the latter thus being often doughnut-shaped)
***** 37 cities are over 100,000, including 
****** 18 cities which serve as a seat for voivode or the voivodeship sejmik, thus being informally called voivodeship cities or capitals (in spite of only 16 voivodeships existing in Poland; the discrepancy is caused by the fact that both institutions are seated in a single capital city in only 14 of the 16 voivodeships, while in each of the remaining two they are divided equally between a pair of capital cities), 
******* 11 of them are seats of an appeal court and other supra-voivodeship institutions,
******** They include the capital city of the country, the only Polish city with population exceeding 1,000,000, and the only one governed by a dedicated act of Parliament.
In some cases, a city with powiat rights may also be a seat of both an eponymous rural gmina and an eponymous regular powiat, despite belonging to neither, e.g. Siedlce, Skierniewice, Słupsk. No city in Poland constitutes a separate voivodeship in its own right, though 5 cities held such status in the past.

==General principles==
All municipalities in Poland are governed regardless of their type under the mandatory mayor–council government system. Executive power in a rural gmina is exercised by a &quot;wójt&quot;, while the homologue in municipalities containing cities or towns is called accordingly either a city mayor (&quot;prezydent miasta&quot;) or a town mayor (&quot;burmistrz&quot;), all of them elected by a two-round direct election, while the town/city council is the legislative, budget-making and oversight body. Any local laws considered non-compliant with the national ones may be invalidated by the respective voivode, whose rulings may be appealed to an administrative court. Decisions in individual cases may in turn be appealed to quasi-judicial bodies named , their ruling subject to appeal to an administrative court. A town or city mayor may be scrutinized or denied funding for his/her projects by the council, but is not politically responsible to it and does not require its confidence to remain in office; therefore, cohabitation is not uncommon. A recall referendum may however be triggered either in respect to the wójt/town mayor/city mayor or to the municipal council through a petition supported by at least 1/10 of eligible voters, but the turnout in the recall referendum must be at least 3/5 of the number of people voting in the original election in order for the referendum to be valid and binding. In addition, elected bodies of any municipality may be suspended by the Prime Minister of Poland in case of persisting law transgressions or negligence, resulting in such case in the municipality being placed under receivership. In a city with powiat rights, the city mayor additionally has the powers and duties of a powiat executive board and a starosta, while the city council has the powers and duties of a powiat (county) council; both nevertheless being elected under the municipal election rules rather than those applicable to county elections.

==Cities==
In spite of no linguistic distinction between a city and a town in the Polish language (both translated ), a city may be recognized among other Polish urban municipalities through being managed by a city mayor (, literally translated city president) instead of a town mayor () as the head of the city executive, thus being informally called &quot;miasto prezydenckie&quot;, with such privilege automatically awarded to municipalities either inhabited by more than 100,000 residents (currently 37) or those enjoying the status of a city with powiat rights (currently 66). As of 2022, all of the former group fit into the latter, though it was not always the case in the past. There is, however, a number of exemptions due to historic or political reasons, when a municipality meets neither of these two conditions but nevertheless has the city status, including the only 3 capitals of the former voivodeships of Poland (1975–1998) not meeting the abovementioned criteria, as well as 38 other municipalities which do not fit into any of the mentioned categories but have nevertheless been allowed to keep the earlier awarded status due to unspecified historical reasons. Among the 37 cities over 100,000, 18 are seats of voivode or voivodeship sejmik, thus carrying the informal designation of a voivodeship city. 11 of them are seats of an appeal court and other supra-voivodeship institutions.

The 107 Polish cities belong to the following size ranges in terms of the number of inhabitants (cities with powiat rights are indicated with &quot;italics&quot;; the seats of either a voivode or a voivodeship legislature are marked in bold, the seats of an appeal court are marked with an asterisk*):
* 1 city larger than 1,000,000: Warsaw*
* 1 city from 750,000 to 1,000,000: Kraków*
* 3 cities from 500,000 to 750,000: Wrocław*, Łódź*, Poznań*
* 6 cities from 250,000 to 500,000: Gdańsk*, Szczecin*, Lublin*, Bydgoszcz, Białystok*, Katowice*
* 26 cities from 100,000 to 250,000: &quot;Gdynia&quot;, &quot;Częstochowa&quot;, &quot;Radom&quot;, Rzeszów*, Toruń, &quot;Sosnowiec&quot;, Kielce, &quot;Gliwice&quot;, Olsztyn, &quot;Zabrze&quot;, &quot;Bielsko-Biała&quot;, &quot;Bytom&quot;, Zielona Góra, &quot;Rybnik&quot;, &quot;Ruda Śląska&quot;, Opole, &quot;Tychy&quot;, Gorzów Wielkopolski, &quot;Elbląg&quot;, &quot;Płock&quot;, &quot;Dąbrowa Górnicza&quot;, &quot;Wałbrzych&quot;, &quot;Włocławek&quot;, &quot;Tarnów&quot;, &quot;Chorzów&quot;, &quot;Koszalin&quot;
* 45 cities from 50,000 to 100,000: &quot;Kalisz&quot;, &quot;Legnica&quot;, &quot;Grudziądz&quot;, &quot;Jaworzno&quot;, &quot;Słupsk&quot;, &quot;Jastrzębie-Zdrój&quot;, &quot;Nowy Sącz&quot;, &quot;Jelenia Góra&quot;, &quot;Siedlce&quot;, &quot;Mysłowice&quot;, &quot;Konin&quot;, Piła, &quot;Piotrków Trybunalski&quot;, Inowrocław, Lubin, Ostrów Wielkopolski, &quot;Suwałki&quot;, Stargard, Gniezno, Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski, &quot;Siemianowice Śląskie&quot;, Głogów, Pabianice, &quot;Leszno&quot;, &quot;Żory&quot;, &quot;Zamość&quot;, Pruszków, &quot;Łomża&quot;, Ełk, Tomaszów Mazowiecki, &quot;Chełm&quot;, Mielec, Kędzierzyn-Koźle, &quot;Przemyśl&quot;, Stalowa Wola, Tczew, &quot;Biała Podlaska&quot;, Bełchatów, Świdnica, Będzin, Zgierz, &quot;Piekary Śląskie&quot;, Racibórz, Legionowo, &quot;Ostrołęka&quot;
* 26 cities from 35,000 to 50,000: &quot;Świętochłowice&quot;, Wejherowo, Zawiercie, &quot;Skierniewice&quot;, Starachowice, Wodzisław Śląski, Starogard Gdański, Puławy, &quot;Tarnobrzeg&quot;, Kołobrzeg, &quot;Krosno&quot;, Radomsko, Kwidzyn, Otwock, Skarżysko-Kamienna, Ciechanów, Kutno, Sieradz, Zduńska Wola, &quot;Świnoujście&quot;, Żyrardów, Bolesławiec, Nowa Sól, Knurów, Oświęcim, and &quot;Sopot&quot;.

The biggest towns (e.g. Tarnowskie Góry, Rumia, Piaseczno) are larger than a number of cities.

==Principal metropolitan areas==
Only a single officially incorporated multi-purpose metropolitan union exists in Poland, the &quot;sui generis&quot; Metropolis GZM, established by a dedicated act of Parliament of Poland within the Silesian Voivodeship, currently composed of 41 contiguous municipalities, with some of them containing also rural areas. Its total population is 2,279,560. The metropolis largely coincides with the metropolitan area of the Katowice urban area, which is a part of the wider polycentric transnational Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area.

A &quot;de facto&quot; metropolitan area is, however, also formed in some aspects by Warsaw metropolitan area, consisting of the capital city of Warsaw, a city with powiat rights, and the 9 neighbouring counties: Warsaw West County, Nowy Dwór County, Legionowo County, Wołomin County, Mińsk County, Otwock County, Piaseczno County, Pruszków County and Grodzisk Mazowiecki County. Warsaw forms together with these counties a NUTS 2 area separate as an exception from the remainder of its home region, the Mazovian Voivodeship. In addition, identical area is policed by the Capital City Police Headquarters separate from the Mazovian Voivodeship Police Headquarters, with a status equal to that of voivodeship police headquarters. Attempts to establish a formally incorporated metropolitan union have been fiercely resisted by the citizens and the city mayor of Warsaw who have considered them a form of concealed gerrymandering, potentially leading to a political takeover of the city government through aiming to counterbalance the profoundly liberal city population with the conservative population of the neighbouring areas. 

A third widely known metropolitan area is the metropolitan area of Tricity in Pomeranian Voivodeship, urban area of which consists of the eponymous cities of Gdańsk, Sopot and Gdynia. The designation has been used informally or semi-formally only. A strategic cooperation declaration, the Tricity Charter (Polish: &quot;Karta Trójmiasta&quot;), was signed by the three city mayors on 28 March 2007. The only incorporated common management authority in the Tricity metro is the Gdańsk Bay Public Transport Metropolitan Union () which is, despite the name, an inter-municipal union and not a metropolitan one.

<doc id="70194" wikidata="Q229202" url="?curid=70194" title="Lady Margaret Beaufort">
<text>Lady Margaret Beaufort ( ; 31 May 1443 – 29 June 1509) was a major figure in the Wars of the Roses of the late fifteenth century, and mother of King Henry VII of England, the first Tudor monarch. She was also a second cousin of Kings Henry VI, Edward IV and Richard III of England.

A descendant of King Edward III, Lady Margaret passed a disputed claim to the English throne to her son, Henry Tudor. Capitalising on the political upheaval of the period, she actively manoeuvred to secure the crown for her son. Margaret&#x27;s efforts ultimately culminated in Henry&#x27;s decisive victory over King Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field. She was thus instrumental in orchestrating the rise to power of the Tudor dynasty. With her son crowned Henry VII, Margaret wielded a considerable degree of political influence and personal autonomy. She was also a major patron and cultural benefactor during her son&#x27;s reign, initiating an era of extensive Tudor patronage.

Margaret is credited with the establishment of two prominent Cambridge colleges, founding Christ&#x27;s College in 1505 and beginning the development of St John&#x27;s College, which was completed posthumously by her executors in 1511. Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, a 19th century foundation named after her, was the first Oxford college to admit women.

==Origins==
Lady Margaret Beaufort was the daughter and sole heiress of John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset (1404–1444), (a legitimised grandson of John of Gaunt and Gaunt&#x27;s mistress Katherine Swynford), and John Beaufort&#x27;s wife Margaret Beauchamp. Lady Margaret was born at Bletsoe Castle, Bedfordshire, either on 31 May 1441 or, more likely, on 31 May 1443. The day and month are not disputed, as she required Westminster Abbey to celebrate her birthday on 31 May.

The year of her birth is less certain. William Dugdale, the 17th-century antiquary, suggested that she had been born in 1441, based on evidence of inquisitions &quot;post mortem&quot; taken after the death of her father. Dugdale has been followed by a number of Lady Margaret&#x27;s biographers; however, it is more likely that she was born in 1443, as in May 1443 her father had negotiated with the king concerning the wardship of his unborn child should he die on campaign.

==Early years==
At the moment of her birth, Margaret&#x27;s father was preparing to go to France and lead an important military expedition for King Henry VI. Somerset negotiated with the king to ensure that if he were to die, the rights to Margaret&#x27;s wardship and marriage would be granted only to his wife.

As Somerset was a tenant-in-chief of the crown, the wardship of his heir fell to the crown under the feudal system. Somerset fell out with the king after coming back from France and was banished from the royal court pending a charge of treason against him. He died shortly afterwards. According to Thomas Basin, Somerset died of illness, but the &quot;Crowland Chronicle&quot; reported that his death was a suicide. As his only surviving child, Margaret was heiress to his considerable fortune and inheritor of his contested claim to the throne. Both effectively rendered Margaret, as her biographers Jones and Underwood write, &quot;a pawn in the unstable political atmosphere of the Lancastrian court&quot;.

Upon her first birthday, the king broke the arrangement with Margaret&#x27;s father and granted the wardship of her extensive lands to William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, although Margaret herself remained in the custody of her mother. Margaret&#x27;s mother was pregnant at the time of Somerset&#x27;s death, but the child did not survive and Margaret remained the sole heir. Although she was her father&#x27;s only legitimate child, Margaret had two maternal half-brothers and three maternal half-sisters from her mother&#x27;s first marriage whom she supported after her son&#x27;s accession to the throne.
Margaret was married to Suffolk&#x27;s son, John de la Pole. The wedding may have been held between 28 January and 7 February 1444, when she was perhaps a year old but certainly no more than three. However, there is more evidence to suggest they were married in January 1450, after Suffolk had been arrested and was looking to secure his son&#x27;s future by betrothing him to a conveniently wealthy ward whose children could be potential claimants to the throne. Papal dispensation was granted on 18 August 1450, necessary because the spouses were closely related (Lady Margaret and de la Pole being the great-grandchildren of two sisters, Katherine Swynford and Philippa Chaucer, respectively), and this concurs with the later date of marriage. Three years later, her marriage to de la Pole was dissolved, and King Henry VI granted Margaret&#x27;s wardship to his own half-brothers, Jasper and Edmund Tudor.

Margaret never recognised the marriage to de la Pole. In her will, made in 1472, Margaret refers to Edmund Tudor as her first husband. Under canon law, Margaret was not bound by her first marriage contract as she was entered into the marriage before reaching the age of twelve.

Even before the annulment of her first marriage, Henry VI chose Margaret as a bride for his half-brother, Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond. This was likely to strengthen Edmund&#x27;s claim to the throne should Henry be forced to designate Edmund his heir; the king was then without child or legitimate siblings. Edmund was the eldest son of the king&#x27;s mother, Catherine of Valois, by Owen Tudor.

At nine years old Margaret was required to assent formally to the marriage. Later she claimed she was divinely guided to do so.

At age twelve Margaret married Edmund Tudor, twelve years her senior, on 1 November 1455. The Wars of the Roses had just broken out. Edmund, a Lancastrian, was taken prisoner by Yorkist forces less than a year later. He died of the plague in captivity at Carmarthen on 3 November 1456, leaving a 13-year-old widow who was pregnant with their child.

The Countess always respected the name and memory of Edmund as the father of her only child. In 1472, sixteen years after his death, Margaret specified in her will that she wanted to be buried alongside Edmund, even though she had enjoyed a long, stable and close marriage with her third husband, who had died in 1471.

===Motherhood===
While in the care of her brother-in-law Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke, on 28 January 1457, the 13-year-old Margaret gave birth to a son, Henry Tudor, at Pembroke Castle. As she was not yet physically mature, the birth was extremely difficult. In a sermon delivered after her death, Margaret&#x27;s confessor, John Fisher, deemed it a miracle that a baby could be born &quot;of so little a personage&quot;. Her son&#x27;s birth may have done permanent physical injury to Margaret; despite two later marriages, she never had another child. Years later, she enumerated a set of proper procedures concerning the delivery of potential heirs, perhaps informed by the difficulty of her own experience.

Shortly after her re-entry into society after the birth, Jasper helped arrange another marriage for her to ensure her son&#x27;s security. She married Sir Henry Stafford (–1471), the second son of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, on 3 January 1458, at the age of fourteen. A dispensation for the marriage was necessary because Margaret and Stafford were second cousins; it was granted on 6 April 1457. They enjoyed a fairly long and harmonious marital relationship and were given Woking Palace, to which Margaret sometimes retreated and which she restored. Margaret and her husband were given 400 marks&#x27; worth of land by Buckingham, but her own estates were still their main source of income. For a time the Staffords were able to visit Margaret&#x27;s son, who had been entrusted to Jasper Tudor&#x27;s care at Pembroke Castle in Wales. 

== Involvement in the Wars of the Roses ==

=== Reign of Edward IV ===
Years of York forces fighting Lancastrian for power culminated in the Battle of Towton in 1461, where the Yorkists were victorious. Edward IV was King of England. The fighting had taken the life of Margaret&#x27;s father-in-law and forced Jasper Tudor to flee to Scotland and France to muster support for the Lancastrian cause. Edward IV gave the lands belonging to Margaret&#x27;s son to his own brother, the Duke of Clarence. Henry became the ward of Sir William Herbert. Again, Beaufort was allowed some visits to her son.

In 1469 the discontented Duke of Clarence and Earl of Warwick incited a rebellion against Edward IV, capturing him after a defeat of his forces. Beaufort used this opportunity to attempt to negotiate with Clarence, hoping to regain custody of her son and his holdings. Soon, however, Edward was back in power.

Warwick&#x27;s continued insurrection resulted in the brief reinstallation of the Lancastrian Henry VI in 1470–71, which was effectively ended with the Yorkist victory at the Battle of Barnet. Faced with York rule once again, Margaret allegedly begged Jasper Tudor, forced to flee abroad once more, to take thirteen-year-old Henry with him. It would be fourteen years before Beaufort saw her son again.

In 1471, Margaret&#x27;s husband, Lord Stafford, died of wounds suffered at the Battle of Barnet, fighting for the Yorkists. At 28 years old, Margaret became a widow again.

In June 1472, Margaret married Thomas Stanley, the Lord High Constable and King of Mann. Jones and Underwood have suggested that Margaret never considered herself a member of the Stanley family. Their marriage was primarily one of convenience; marrying Stanley enabled Margaret to return to the court of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. Indeed, Gristwood speculates Beaufort organized the marriage with the sole aim of rehabilitating her image and securing herself a prime position from which to advocate for her son. Evidently her efforts were successful; Margaret was chosen by Queen Elizabeth to be godmother to one of her daughters.

Holinshed, a Tudor chronicler, claims King Edward IV later proposed a marriage between Beaufort&#x27;s son and his own daughter, Elizabeth of York, intending to force Henry Tudor out of his safe haven on the continent. Poet Bernard Andre seems to corroborate this, writing of Tudor&#x27;s miraculous escape from the clutches of Edward&#x27;s envoys, allegedly warned of the deception by none other than his mother.

=== Reigns of Edward V and Richard III ===

Following Edward IV&#x27;s death in April 1483 and the seizure of the throne in June by Richard III from Edward V, Margaret was soon back at court serving the new queen, Anne Neville. Margaret carried Anne&#x27;s train at the coronation. Seeking her son&#x27;s return to England, Margaret appears to have negotiated with Richard.

Despite what these negotiations may suggest, Lady Margaret is known to have conspired with Elizabeth Woodville, mother of the two York princes whom Richard confined to the Tower of London, after rumours spread of the boys&#x27; murder. It was at this point, according to Polydore Vergil, that Beaufort &quot;began to hope well of her son&#x27;s fortune&quot;.

Beaufort is believed to have initiated discussions with Woodville, via mutual physician, Lewis Caerleon, who conveyed secret correspondences between the two women. Together they conspired to supplant King Richard and by joint force replace him with Margaret&#x27;s son, Henry Tudor. Their solidified alliance further secured the subsequent dynasty by the agreed betrothal of Henry to Elizabeth of York. They hoped this proposal would attract both Yorkist and Lancastrian support.

As to the fate of the princes, it is widely held that Richard III ordered the death of his two nephews to secure his own reign. Gristwood, however, suggests that another was responsible; Henry Tudor&#x27;s path to the throne was certainly expedited by their disappearance, perhaps motive enough for his mother – his &quot;highly able and totally committed representative&quot; – to give the order.

Despite this suggestion, no contemporary sources corroborate the implication, whilst most contemporary accounts outline &quot;her outstanding qualities, her courage, presence of mind, family loyalty, and a deeply felt awareness of the spiritual responsibilities of high office,&quot; as clarified by Jones and Underwood. Before Jones and Underwood, there was no consensus within the scholarly community regarding Margaret&#x27;s role or character: historiographical opinions ranged from celebrating her to demonizing her.

It was not until the 17th century that religious retrospective speculations began to criticize Lady Margaret, but even then only as a &quot;politic and contriving woman,&quot; and never anything beyond shrewd or calculating. All things considered, the words of her own contemporaries, such as Tudor historian Polydore Vergil, continue to extol Lady Margaret&#x27;s noble virtues as &quot;the most pious woman,&quot; further removing her from accusations of wickedness.

Erasmus, in writing about his friend the Bishop, Saint John Fisher, praised Margaret&#x27;s support of religious institutions and the Bishop, further attesting the simultaneously pragmatic and charitable nature testified in the funerary sermon dedicated by the Bishop himself, as laid out in a following section.

In 1483 Margaret was certainly involved in – if not the mastermind behind – Buckingham&#x27;s rebellion. Indeed, in his biography of Richard III, historian Paul Murray Kendall describes Beaufort as the &quot;Athena of the rebellion&quot;. Perhaps with duplicitous motives (as he may have been desirous of the crown for himself), Buckingham conspired with Beaufort and Woodville to dethrone Richard. Margaret&#x27;s son was to sail from Brittany to join forces with him, but he arrived too late.

In October, Beaufort&#x27;s scheme proved unsuccessful; the Duke was executed and Tudor was forced back across the English Channel. Beaufort appears to have played a large role in financing the insurrection. In response to her betrayal, Richard passed an act of Parliament stripping Margaret of all her titles and estates, declaring her guilty of the following:

Richard did, however, stop short of a full attainder by transferring Margaret&#x27;s property to her husband, Lord Stanley. He also effectively imprisoned Margaret in her husband&#x27;s home with the hope of preventing any further correspondence with her son. However, her husband failed to stop Margaret&#x27;s continued communication with her son. When the time came for Henry to press his claim, he relied heavily on his mother to raise support for him in England.

Margaret&#x27;s husband Stanley, despite having fought for Richard III during the Buckingham rebellion, did not respond when summoned to fight at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, remaining aloof from the battle, even though his eldest son, George Stanley (styled Lord Strange), was held hostage by Richard. After the battle, it was Stanley who placed the crown on the head of his stepson (Henry VII), who later made him Earl of Derby. Margaret was then styled &quot;Countess of Richmond and Derby&quot;. She was invested as a Lady of the Order of the Garter (LG) in 1488.
==Margaret Beaufort in power==


After her son&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field, the Countess was referred to in court as &quot;My Lady the King&#x27;s Mother&quot;. Her son&#x27;s first Parliament reversed the attainder against her and declared her a &quot;feme sole&quot;. This status granted Beaufort considerable legal and social independence from men. She was allowed to own property separately from her husband (as though she were unmarried) and sue in court – two rights denied to contemporary married women.
As arranged by their mothers, Henry married Elizabeth of York. The Countess was reluctant to accept a lower status than the dowager queen Elizabeth or even her daughter-in-law, the queen consort. She wore robes of the same quality as the queen consort and walked only half a pace behind her. Elizabeth&#x27;s biographer, Amy Licence, states that this &quot;would have been the correct courtly protocol&quot;, adding that &quot;only one person knew how Elizabeth really felt about Margaret and she did not commit it to paper.&quot;

Margaret had written her signature as &quot;M. Richmond&quot; for years, since the 1460s. In 1499, she changed her signature to &quot;Margaret R.&quot;, perhaps to signify her royal authority (&quot;R&quot; standing either for &quot;regina&quot; – queen in Latin as customarily employed by female monarchs – or for Richmond). Furthermore, she included the Tudor crown and the caption &quot;et mater Henrici septimi regis Angliæ et Hiberniæ&quot; (&quot;and mother of Henry VII, king of England and Ireland&quot;).

Many historians believe the departure from court of dowager queen Elizabeth Woodville in 1487 was partly at the behest of Henry&#x27;s influential mother, though this is uncertain.

Beaufort exerted considerable political influence within the Tudor court. The power she exercised was evidently obvious; a report from Spanish envoy Pedro de Ayala dating to 1498 claimed Henry was &quot;much influenced by his mother and his followers in affairs or personal interest and in others.&quot; In the earlier years of her son&#x27;s reign, records indicate Margaret usually accompanied the royal couple when they traveled.

While Margaret&#x27;s position in the royal court was, to some extent, an expression of gratitude by her son, she was likely far less the passive recipient of Henry&#x27;s favor one might expect. As Gristwood suggests in the following, Beaufort instead actively contrived to further her standing:

&quot;A place had to be created for the sort of &#x27;king&#x27;s mother&#x27; Margaret was determined to be. Perhaps if Margaret had become a queen, a role that she clearly felt Fortune had denied her, she would not have felt the need to press for her rights quite so stridently.&quot;

However, Lady Margaret&#x27;s immediate petitions were not for queenly powers of rule over others, but were two succinct demands for independence and liberty of self, which were products of expert legal advice, as opposed to a desperate desire to rule.

The first Act reversed the legislation that had robbed Margaret of her properties under the reign of Richard III, deeming it &quot;entirely void, annulled and of no force or effect&quot;. The second Act of November 1485 stated that she would enjoy all her properties and titles, and could pursue any legal action as any &quot;single unmarried person might or may do at any time&quot;, despite still being married.

Moreover, as with many decisions made to secure the new dynasty, these Acts of Parliament passed appear to be a collaborative effort, mutually beneficial to both mother and son, as by granting Margaret the status of a femme sole, Henry and his Parliament made it possible to empower the King&#x27;s Mother without giving further
leverage to the Stanleys, since Margaret could use any wealth granted to her for her own purposes, thereby circumventing the prevailing idea of coverture.

In his chronicle, Polydore Vergil assessed the partnership between the Tudor king and his mother, noting that Henry gave her a share of most of his public and private resources, contrary to any assertion that Margaret desired greater power. Or, as King Henry Tudor states in a letter to his mother: &quot;...not only in this but in all other things that I may know should be to your honour and pleasure, and will of your self, I shall be as glad to please you as your heart can desire.&quot;

Lady Margaret&#x27;s wardship of brothers, Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, and Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, is one of many examples of how her unique position allowed her in varying aspects to operate beyond the scope of any queen, a position which, instead of hindering or irritating her at all, proved advantageous to the state of the Crown and delineated her as a helpful and happy agent of its course, as she refused monetary recompense for her stewardship in this arena and successfully secured the allegiance of the Duke of Buckingham to King Henry Tudor, a loyalty that would fade away from the Crown once she and her son were gone.

Later in her marriage, the Countess preferred living alone. In 1499, with her husband&#x27;s permission, she took a vow of chastity in the presence of Richard FitzJames, Bishop of London. Taking a vow of chastity while being married was unusual but not unprecedented. The Countess moved away from her husband and lived alone at Collyweston, Northamptonshire (near Stamford). She was regularly visited by her husband, who had rooms reserved for him. Margaret renewed her vows in 1504. From her principal residence at Collyweston she was given a special commission to administer justice over the Midlands and the North.

Beaufort was also actively involved in the domestic life of the royal family. She created a proper protocol regarding the birth and upbringing of royal heirs. Though their relationship is often portrayed as antagonistic, Beaufort and her daughter-in-law Elizabeth worked together when planning the marriages of the royal children. They wrote jointly of the necessary instruction for Catherine of Aragon, who was to marry Elizabeth&#x27;s son Prince Arthur. Both women also conspired to prevent Elizabeth and Henry&#x27;s daughter Margaret from being married to the Scottish king at too young an age; in this matter, Gristwood writes, Beaufort was undoubtedly resolved that her granddaughter &quot;should not share her fate&quot;.

After Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 1503, Margaret became the principal female presence at court. When Arthur died, Margaret played a part in ensuring her grandson Henry, the new heir apparent, was raised appropriately by selecting some members of his new household.

The Countess was known for her education and her piety. Biographers Jones and Underwood claim the entirety of Beaufort&#x27;s life can be understood in the context of her &quot;deeply-felt love and loyalty to her son&quot;. Henry is said to have been likewise devoted. A surviving letter written by Henry to his mother reveals his sense of gratitude and appreciation:

&quot;All which thyngs according to your desire and plesure I have with all my herte and goode wille giffen and graunted unto you... I shall be as glad to plese you as youre herte can desire hit, and I knowe welle that I am as much bounden so to doe as any creture lyvyng, for the grete and singular moderly love and affection that hit hath plesed you at all tymes to ber towards me&quot;.

Henry VII died on 21 April 1509, having designated his mother chief executrix of his will. For two days after the death of her son, Margaret scrambled to secure the smooth succession of her grandson, Henry VIII. She arranged her son&#x27;s funeral and her grandson&#x27;s coronation. At her son&#x27;s funeral she was given precedence over all the other women of the royal family.

Before her death Beaufort also left her mark on the early reign of Henry VIII; when her eighteen-year-old grandson chose members of his privy council, it was Margaret&#x27;s suggestions he took.

==Death==

Margaret had been ill for several days, as legend has it, after eating a cygnet (a young swan) for dinner. The Countess died in the Deanery of Westminster Abbey on 29 June 1509. This was the day after her grandson Henry VIII&#x27;s 18th birthday, 5 days after his coronation and just over two months after the death of her son.

She had made her will and a schedule of bequests in February 1509, making arrangements for her funeral and donations to religious foundations. She made bequests of her jewellery and gold cups to Catherine of Aragon, Margaret Tudor, and Mary Tudor, and a chalice to the parish church at Collyweston.

Margaret is buried in the Henry VII Chapel of the Abbey. Her tomb is now situated between the later graves of William III and Mary II and the tomb of her great-great-granddaughter Mary, Queen of Scots.
Her tomb was created by Pietro Torrigiano, who probably arrived in England in 1509 and received the commission in the following year. The gilded bronze sculpture on the tomb depicts Margaret with her head resting on pillows and her hands raised in prayer, wearing garments characteristic of widowhood; the face was probably sculpted from a death mask. The black marble tomb is embellished with heraldic bronze insignia, including a yale, her heraldic badge, at her feet.

Erasmus wrote the Latin inscription on her tomb. In English it reads: &quot;Margaret, Countess of Richmond, mother of Henry VII, grandmother of Henry VIII, who donated funds for three monks of this abbey, a grammar school in Wimborne, a preacher in the whole of England, two lecturers in Scripture, one at Oxford, the other at Cambridge, where she also founded two colleges, one dedicated to Christ, and the other to St John, the Evangelist.&quot;

In 1539 iron railings, elaborately painted with coats of arms and other ornaments, were erected around the tomb. The ironwork was sold off by the Abbey in 1823 but recovered and restored a century later.

==Legacy==

Lady Margaret Beaufort was a lifelong artistic patron and supporter of academia.
While married to Lord Stanley Margaret endowed the building of chapels in Wales. Like Edward IV and his court, she was also involved with the advances in printing of William Caxton and his successor Wynkyn de Worde, not only as a patroness but for her own acquisition. The first book she commissioned from Caxton in 1483 was the 13th-century French romance &quot;Blanchardin et Eglantine&quot;, which mirrored fairly closely the match she was forging in secret between her son Henry and Elizabeth of York, with the aid of Elizabeth Woodville, then in sanctuary from Richard III in Westminster Abbey. Six years later, after Richard&#x27;s defeat by Henry at Bosworth, she commissioned an English translation of the romance from Caxton: it heralded the beginning of a period of Tudor patronage. Apart from encouraging book production and building her own library, Margaret also achieved considerable success as a translator, becoming the first English translator of the &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot; known by name, as well as translating the fifteenth-century Netherlandish treatise &quot;The Mirror of Gold for the Sinful Soul&quot; from a French intermediary.

In 1497 she announced her intention to build a free school for the general public of Wimborne. Following her death in 1509, Wimborne Grammar School came into existence, to become Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s School, Wimborne Minster.

In 1502 she established the Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professorship of Divinity at the University of Cambridge. In 1505 she refounded and enlarged God&#x27;s House, Cambridge as Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge with a royal charter from the king. She has been honoured ever since as the Foundress of the college. A copy of her signature can be found carved on one of the buildings (4 staircase, 1994) within the college. In 1511, St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge was founded by her estate, either at her direct behest or at the suggestion of her chaplain, John Fisher. Land that she owned around Great Bradley in Suffolk was bequeathed to St. John&#x27;s upon its foundation. Her portraits hang in the Great Halls and other college rooms of both Christ&#x27;s and St. John&#x27;s, accompanied by portraits of John Fisher. Unusually, both colleges have the same coats of arms, using her crest and motto. Furthermore, various societies, including the Lady Margaret Society as well as the Beaufort Club at Christ&#x27;s, and the Lady Margaret Boat Club at John&#x27;s, were named after her.

In 1540, funds she had bequeathed endowed a lectureship in divinity at the University of Oxford, first held by John Roper; it became the Lady Margaret Professorship of Divinity, held concurrently with a canonship at Christ Church, Oxford. Lady Margaret Hall, the first women&#x27;s college at the University of Oxford (founded in 1878), was named in her honour.

A practical woman, when faced with problems of flooding in parts of the Fens that threatened some of her properties, she was able to initiate an ambitious drainage scheme, involving foreign engineers, that saw the construction of a large sluice at Boston. She funded the restoration of Church of All Saints, Martock in Somerset, and the construction of the church tower.

Margaret Beaufort Middle School (formerly Margaret Beaufort County Secondary Modern School) in Riseley, Bedfordshire, near her birthplace at Bletsoe Castle, is named after her. In 1993 the Margaret Beaufort Institute of Theology on Grange Road, Cambridge was founded and named in her honour. It is now a
coeducational interdenominational theological college, having originally begun as a centre for training Catholic laywomen in religion and theology.

==Portraits==

There is no surviving portrait of Margaret Beaufort dating from her lifetime. All known portraits, however, are in essentially the same format, depicting her in her later years, wearing a long, peaked, white headdress and in a pose of religious contemplation. Most of these were made in the reign of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I as symbols of loyalty to the Tudor regime. They may be based on a lost original, or be derived from the sculpture on her tomb in Westminster Abbey, in which she wears the same headdress.

One portrait by Meynnart Wewyck in 1510 shows her at prayer in her richly furnished private closet behind her chamber. The plain desk at which she kneels is draped with a richly patterned textile that is so densely encrusted with embroidery that its corners stand away stiffly. Her lavishly illuminated Book of Hours is open before her, with its protective cloth wrapper (called a &quot;chemise&quot; binding), spread out around it. The walls are patterned with oak leaf designs, perhaps in lozenges, perhaps of stamped and part-gilded leather. Against the wall hangs the dosser of her canopy of estate, with the tester above her head (the Tudor rose at its centre) supported on cords from the ceiling. The coats-of-arms woven into the tapestry are of England (parted as usual with France) and the portcullis badge of the Beauforts, which the early Tudor kings later used in their arms. Small stained glass roundels in the leaded glass of her lancet windows also display elements of the arms of both England (cropped away here) and Beaufort. The painting, which measures 180 cm by 122 cm, is notable as the first large-scale portrait of an Englishwoman.

In 2023, restoration work on the Wewyck portrait revealed that it had been overpainted several times throughout its history, with Margaret&#x27;s original facial expression made more sombre and pious.

<text>The United States is the third most populous country in the world, and the most populous in the Americas and the Western Hemisphere, with an estimated population of 340,110,988 on July 1, 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. This was an increase of 2.6% over the 2020 federal census of 331,449,281 residents. These figures include the 50 states and the federal capital, Washington, D.C., but exclude the 3.6 million residents of five unincorporated U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands) as well as several minor uninhabited island possessions. The Census Bureau showed a population increase of 0.98% for the twelve-month period ending in July 2024, slightly below the world estimated annual growth rate of 1.03%. The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2024 was around 1.61 children per woman, which is below the replacement fertility rate of approximately 2.1. By several metrics, including racial and ethnic background, religious affiliation, and percentage of rural and urban divide, the state of Illinois is the most representative of the larger demography of the United States. 

The United States population almost quadrupled during the 20th century—at a growth rate of about 1.3% a year—from about 76 million in 1900 to 281 million in 2000. It is estimated to have reached the 200 million mark in 1967, and the 300 million mark on October 17, 2006. Foreign-born immigration caused the U.S. population to continue its rapid increase, with this population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 45 million in 2015, representing one-third of the population increase. The U.S. Census Bureau reported in late 2024 that recent immigration to the United States had more than offset the country&#x27;s lower birth and fertility rates: &quot;Net international migration’s influence on population trends has increased over the last few years. Since 2021, it accounted for the majority of the nation’s growth—a departure from the last two decades, when natural increase was the main factor.&quot; This in turn led to a notable increase in the U.S. population in each of the years 2022, 2023, and 2024 (+0.58%, +0.83%, and +0.98%, respectively).

Population growth is fastest among minorities as a whole, and according to a 2020 U.S. Census Bureau analysis, 50% of U.S. children under the age of 18 are now members of ethnic minority groups. 
As of 2020, white Americans numbered 235,411,507 or 71% of the population, including people who identified as white in combination with another race. People who identified as white alone (including Hispanic whites) numbered 204,277,273 or 61.6% of the population, while non-Latino whites made up 57.8% of the country&#x27;s population.

Latino Americans accounted for 51.1% of the country&#x27;s total population growth between 2010 and 2020. The Hispanic or Latino population increased from 50.5 million in 2010 to 62.1 million in 2020, a 23% increase and a numerical increase of more than 11.6 million. Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to provide most of the U.S. population gains in the decades ahead.

Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial group in the United States, with a growth rate of 35%. However, multi-racial Asian Americans make up the fastest-growing subgroup, with a growth rate of 55%, reflecting the increase of mixed-race marriages in the United States.

, births to White American mothers remain around 50% of the U.S. total, a decline of 3% compared to 2021. In the same time period, births to Asian American and Hispanic women increased by 2% and 6%, respectively.



==History==
==Population==
In 1900, when the U.S. population was 76 million, there were 66.8 million white Americans in the United States, representing 88% of the total population, 8.8 million Black Americans, with about 90% of them still living in Southern states, and slightly more than 500,000 Hispanics.

Under federal law, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the number of first-generation immigrants living in the United States has increased, from 9.6 million in 1970 to about 38 million in 2007. Around a million people legally immigrated to the United States per year in the 1990s, up from 250,000 per year in the 1950s.

In 1900, non-Hispanic whites comprised almost 97% of the population of the 10 largest U.S. cities. The Census Bureau reported that minorities (including Hispanic whites) made up 50.4% of the children born in the U.S. between July 2010 and July 2011, compared to 37% in 1990.

In 2014, the state with the lowest fertility rate was Rhode Island, with a rate of 1.56, while Utah had the greatest rate with a rate of 2.33. This correlates with the ages of the states&#x27; populations: Rhode Island has the ninth-oldest median age in the US39.2while Utah has the youngest29.0.

In 2017, the U.S. birth rate remains well below the replacement level needed – at least 2.1 children per woman so as not to experience population decreases – as white American births fell in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Among non-Hispanic white women, no states had a fertility rate above the replacement level. Among non-Hispanic Black women, 12 states reached above the replacement level needed. Among Hispanic women, 29 states did. For non-Hispanic white women, the highest total fertility rate was in Utah, at 2.099, and the lowest in the District of Columbia, at 1.012. Among non-Hispanic Black women, the highest total fertility rate was in Maine, at 4.003, and the lowest in Wyoming, at 1.146. For Hispanic women, the highest total fertility rate was in Alabama, at 3.085, and the lowest in Vermont, at 1.200, and Maine, at 1.281. As of 2016, due to aging, low birth rates and rising mortality driven partly by drug overdoses, deaths outnumber births among non-Hispanic whites in more than half the states in the country.

===Growth rate===

*U.S. population growth rates: 0.98% (2024), 0.83% (2023), 0.58% (2022), 0.16% (2021), 0.41% (2020)

===Age and sex distribution===

&quot;Note that this table shows some people in more than one group: for example someone aged 90 is included three times: in &quot;65+&quot;, &quot;75+&quot; and &quot;85+&quot;.&quot;

====Percent distribution of the total population by age: 1900 to 2015====

=== Dependency ratio ===

The dependency ratio is the age-population ratio of people who are normally not in the labor force (the dependent population, which includes those aged 0 to 14 and 65 and older) to those who are (the productive part, ages 15 to 64). It is used to gauge the strain on the populace that is productive. The support ratio is the ratio of the working-age population to the elderly population, that is, the reciprocal of the aged dependency ratio.


===Density===
The most densely populated state is New Jersey (1,263/mi2 or 488/km2).

The population is highly urbanized, with 83.3% of the population residing in cities and suburbs. Large urban clusters are spread throughout the eastern half of the United States (particularly the Great Lakes area, northeast, east, and southeast) and the western tier states; mountainous areas, principally the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian chain, deserts in the southwest, the dense boreal forests in the extreme north, and the central prairie states are less densely populated; Alaska&#x27;s population is concentrated along its southern coast – with particular emphasis on the city of Anchorage – and Hawaii&#x27;s is centered on the island of Oahu. California and Texas are the most populous states, as the mean center of U.S. population has consistently shifted westward and southward. New York City is the most populous city in the United States and has been since at least 1790.

In the U.S. territories, population centers include the San Juan metro area in Puerto Rico, Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, and the island of Tutuila in American Samoa.

===Median age of the population===
The median age of the total population as of 2021 is 38.8 years; the male median age is 37.7 years; the female median age is 39.8 years.

===Population centers===

The United States has dozens of major cities, including 31 &quot;global cities&quot; of all types, with 10 in the &quot;alpha&quot; group of global cities: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Boston, San Francisco, Miami, Philadelphia, Dallas, and Atlanta. , the United States had 56 metropolitan areas with 1 million or more inhabitants. (The U.S. Census Bureau ranked Urban Honolulu as the 56th most populous area, with just over 1 million residents. See Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas.)

, about 250 million Americans live in or around urban areas. That means more than three-quarters of the U.S. population shares just about three percent of the U.S. land area.

The following table shows the populations of the top twenty metropolitan areas.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2021, the population of the United States grew at a slower rate than in any other year since the country&#x27;s founding. The U.S. population grew only 0.1% from the previous year before. The United States&#x27; population has grown by less than one million people for the first time since 1937, with the lowest numeric growth since at least 1900, when the Census Bureau began yearly population estimates. Apart from the previous few years, when population growth plummeted to historically low levels, the slowest pace of increase in the twentieth century occurred between 1918 and 1919, when the influenza epidemic and World War I were both in full swing. Slower population growth has been the norm in the United States for some years, owing to lower fertility and net international migration, as well as rising mortality from an aging population.

To put it another way, since the mid-2010s, births and net international migration have been dropping while deaths have risen. These trends have a cumulative effect of reduced population increase.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend, resulting in a historically slow population increase in 2021.

The growth rate is 0.1% as estimated for 2021.

The birth rate is 11.0 births/1,000 population, as of 2020. This was the lowest birth rate since records began. There were 3,613,647 births in 2020, this was the lowest number of births since 1980. 
:11.0 births/1,000 population per year (final data for 2020). 
:11.4 births/1,000 population per year (final data for 2019).
In 2020, the CDC reported that there were 1,676,911 marriages in 2020, compared to 2019, there were 2,015,603 marriages. Marriage rates varied significantly by state, ranging from 3.2 marriages/1,000 population in California to 21.0 marriages/1,000 population in Nevada.*

* 6.1 marriages/1,000 population per year (provisional data for 2019).
*Rates are based on provisional counts of marriages by state of occurrence

In 2009, &quot;Time magazine&quot; reported that 40% of births were to unmarried women. The following is a breakdown by race for unwed births: 17% Asian, 29% White, 53% Hispanics (of any race), 66% Native Americans, and 72% Black American.

According to the CDC, in 2020, there were at least, 1,461,121 births to unmarried women. In 2020, 40.5% of births were to unmarried women. The following is a breakdown by race for unwed births: 28.4% Non-Hispanic White, 70.4% Non-Hispanic Black, and 52.8% Hispanic (of any race).

The drop in the birth rate from 2007 to 2009 is believed to be associated with the Great Recession.

A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that more than half (51 percent) of live hospital births in 2008 and 2011 were male.

Per U.S. federal government data released in March 2011, births fell 4% from 2007 to 2009, the largest drop in the U.S. for any two-year period since the 1970s.
Births have declined for three consecutive years, and are now 7% below the peak in 2007. This drop has continued through 2010, according to data released by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics in June 2011. Numerous experts have suggested that this decline is largely a reflection of unfavorable economic conditions. This connection between birth rates and economic downturns partly stems from the fact that American birth rates have now fallen to levels that are comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Teen birth rates in the U.S. are at the lowest level in U.S. history. In fact, teen birth rates in the U.S. have consistently decreased since 1991 through 2011, except for a brief increase between 2005 and 2007. The other aberration from this otherwise steady decline in teen birth rates is the 6% decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009. Despite these years of decrease, U.S. teen birth rates are still higher than in other developed nations. Racial differences prevail with teen birth and pregnancy rates as well. The American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teen birth rate.

===Total fertility rate (TFR)===
In 1800 the average U.S. woman had 7.04 children; by the first decade of the 1900s, this number had already decreased to 3.56. Since 1971, the birth rate has generally been below the replacement rate of 2.1. Since the Great Recession of 2007, the rate has consistently been below replacement. The drop in the TFR from 2.08 per woman in 2007 to 1.76 in 2017 was mostly due to the declining birth rate of ethnic minorities, teenagers and women in their 30s. During that period, the birthrate for women ages 35 to 44 has risen. The 12 month ending general fertility rate increased from 56.6 to 57.0 in 2022 Q1 compared to 2021 Q4.

* 1.71 for non-Hispanic Blacks
* 1.65 for Native Americans (including Hispanics)
* 1.53 for Asian Americans (including Hispanics)

====Total fertility rates by state====
===Births and fertility by race===
A total of 3,659,289 babies were born in 2021, a 1% increase from 2020. Additionally, researchers also looked at births by race and found that White and Hispanic women each saw the number of births increase by about 2% from 2020 to 2021. Meanwhile, Black and Asian women saw the number of births decline by 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively, over the same period, while American Indian/Alaskan Native women saw their numbers fall by 3.2%. It also marks the first rise in births since 2014. Prior to this report, the total number of births had been decreasing by an average of 2% per year. However, the total fertility rate (the number of births that the average women have over their lifetimes) was 1.6635 births per every woman. This is still below the replacement level, the level a population needs to replace itself, which is, at least, 2.1 births per woman.

===Life expectancy===


According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), average American life expectancy at birth was 78.4 years in 2023. This was a gain of 0.9 year from 77.5 years in 2022. It was 76.4 years in 2021.
* Male: 75.8 years (2023), 74.8 years (2022), 73.5 years (2021)
* Female: 81.1 years (2023), 80.2 years (2022), 79.3 years (2021)

Starting in 1998, life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans&#x27; &quot;health disadvantage&quot; gap has been increasing ever since. Average U.S. life expectancy in the United States has actually declined in four of the years following 2014 (the year when average U.S. life expectancy reached 78.9 years, its historical peak). These declines were mostly reversed in both 2022 (+1.1 years) and 2023 (+0.9 year). As of 2024, death rates among the youngest remain well higher than in peer nations. In 2023, there lower death rates in each of the ten U.S. leading causes of death but gains in life expectancy were largely driven by &quot;decreases in mortality due to COVID-19, heart disease, unintentional injuries, cancer and diabetes&quot;.

From 2019 to 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had contributed to approximately 61% of the decrease in life expectancy in the United States. While increases in mortality from unintentional injuries, heart disease, homicide, and diabetes contributed to 11.7%, 5.8%, 2.9%, and 2.8% of the decrease in life expectancy from 2019 to 2020, respectively. Life expectancy has also varied by racial and ethnic group, with Non-Hispanic Asians having the highest life expectancy and Non-Hispanic American Indians having the lowest. In 2021, life expectancy at birth in the United States fell for the second year in a row, the first two-year drop since 1961–1963.

== Population projections ==

The United States Census Bureau&#x27;s 2017 projections were produced using the cohort-component method. In the cohort-component method, the components of population change (fertility, mortality, and net migration) are projected separately for each birth cohort (persons born in a given year). The base population is advanced each year by using projected survival rates and net international migration. Each year, a new birth cohort is added to the population by applying the projected fertility rates to the female population.

==Race and ethnicity==



;Hispanic and Non-Hispanic racial groups (2020 census):





===Race===

The United States Census Bureau collects racial data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. Many other countries count multiple races based on origin while America compiles multiple dozens of ethnicity groups into skin color grouping them together. The racial classifications and definitions used by the U.S. Census Bureau are:
* White: a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as &quot;White&quot; or report entries such as English, Iranian (Azerbaijani, Kurd and Lur), Irish, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Lebanese, Arab, Moroccan, or Caucasian.
* Black or African American: a person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as &quot;Black, African Am.&quot; or report entries such as African American, Kenyan, Nigerian, or Haitian.
* American Indian or Alaska Native: a person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. This category includes people who indicate their race as &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native&quot; or report entries such as Navajo, Blackfeet, Inupiat, Yup&#x27;ik, Central American Indian groups, or South American Indian groups.
* Asian: a person having origins in any of the original peoples of East Asia, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example: Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.
* Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.
* Some other race: includes all other responses not included in the &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Black or African American&quot;, &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native&quot;, &quot;Asian&quot;, and &quot;Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander&quot; racial categories described above includes Asians from West Asia or Russia (non-European Russia) and White Africans.
* Two or more races: people may choose to provide two or more races either by checking two or more race response check boxes, providing multiple responses, or some combination of check boxes and other responses.

Data about race and ethnicity are self-reported to the Census Bureau. Since the 2000 census, Congress has authorized people to identify themselves according to more than one racial classification by selecting more than one category. Only one ethnicity may be selected, however, because the Census Bureau recognizes only two ethnicities&quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; and &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino&quot;which are mutually exclusive since you can be one or the other, but not both. The singular term Hispanic has been supplanted as a federally-recognized ethnicity by the combined &quot;Hispanic or Latino,&quot; defined by the Census Bureau as a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.

According to the Census Bureau website, the racial composition of the United States in 2021 was:

According to the 2022 American Community Survey, the racial composition of the United States in 2022 was:

===Hispanic or Latino origin===

The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; as a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race. People who identify with the terms &quot;Hispanic&quot; or &quot;Latino&quot; are those who classify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the decennial census questionnaire and various Census Bureau survey questionnaires – &quot;Mexican, Mexican Am., Chicano&quot; or &quot;Puerto Rican&quot; or &quot;Cuban&quot; – as well as those who indicate that they are &quot;another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.&quot; People who identify their origin as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race.

===Indigenous peoples===

As of 2020, there are 9,666,058 people identifying as American Indian and Alaska Native people in the United States, including those identifying with more than one race, representing around 3% of the U.S. population. This number includes not only groups indigenous to the United States, but any Indigenous people of the Americas, including Mesoamerican peoples such as the Maya, as well as Canadian and South American natives. In 2022, 634,503 Indigenous people in the United States identified with Central American Indigenous groups, 875,183 identified with the Indigenous people of Mexico, and 47,518 identified with Canadian First Nations. Of the 3.2 million Americans who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native alone in 2022, around 45% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, with this number growing as increasing numbers of Indigenous people from Latin American countries immigrate to the US and more Latinos self-identify with indigenous heritage. Of groups Indigenous to the contiguous United States, the largest self-reported tribes are Cherokee (1,449,888), Navajo (434,910), Choctaw (295,373), Blackfeet (288,255), and Sioux (220,739). Additionally, 205,954 identify with an Alaska Native tribe. There are 573 federally recognized tribal governments in the United States.

The US Census Bureau classifies Native Hawaiians separately from American Indians and Alaska Natives, grouping them with Pacific Islanders instead. According to 2022 estimates, 714,847 Americans identified with Native Hawaiian ancestry.

===Other groups===
There were 16.1 million veterans in 2022, with only 6.2% of Americans having served in the Armed Forces.

In 2010, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; estimated that there were 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. As of 2017, Pew Research reported that there an estimated 10.5 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S.

In 2022, an estimated 1,849,176 adults were imprisoned in the US.

===Projections===

A report by the U.S. Census Bureau projects a decrease in the ratio of non-Hispanic Whites between 2023 and 2060, a decline from 58.9% of the population to 44.9%. Non-Hispanic Whites are projected to no longer make up a majority of the population by 2050, but will remain the largest single ethnic group. Non-Hispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960. 

While non-Hispanic whites are projected to become a minority, the total White population (including Hispanics), will remain a majority from 2023 to 2060, falling from 75.5% to 72.3% of the population who are white alone according to the projections. However, these projections are not directly comparable to other Census Bureau data, as they are based on a modified race dataset, which does not include the &quot;some other race&quot; category used in census surveys. Individuals identifying as “some other race” alone or in combination made up 16.2% of the population in 2022, and they are reclassified into recognized race categories in the dataset used for the projections. As a result, there is a significant discrepancy between the share of the white alone population in 2023 according to the projections (75.5%), and the estimated share of white alone (60.9%), as reported by the American Community Survey in 2022. 

The report foresees the Hispanic or Latino population rising from 19.1% today to 26.9% by 2060, the Black percentage barely rising from 13.6% to 14.8%, and Asian Americans upping their 6.3% share to 9.4%. The United States had a population of 333 million people in July 2023, and is projected to reach 355  million by 2040 and 364 million in 2060. It is further projected that all of the increase in population from 2023 to 2060 will be due to immigrants.

Of the nation&#x27;s children in 2060, 64% are expected to be of a minority ethnicity, up from 51% today. Approximately 32% are projected to be Hispanic or Latino (up from 26% in 2023), and 36% are projected to be single-race, non-Hispanic Whites (down from 49% in 2023). Racial and ethnic minorities surpassed non-Hispanic whites as the largest group of U.S. children under 5 years old in 2015.

The fastest growing racial group in America is Asian Americans with a growth rate of 35%, however the multi-racial mixed Asian group is growing even faster, with a growth rate of 55%. Multi-racial Asians are therefore the fastest growing demographic group in America.

In 2020, it was reported that 51.0% of births were to non-Hispanic white mothers. In 2021, the percentage increased to 51.5%. However, by 2022 the rate of births to white mothers had declined by 3%, dropping to 50% of all total births. In the same period, the rate of births to Asian and Hispanic women increased by 2% and 6%, respectively.

;Pew Research Center projections:
The United Nations projects a population of just over 400 million in 2060.
The country&#x27;s racial profile will be vastly different, and although whites will remain the single largest ethnic group in the U.S., they will no longer be a majority excluding White Hispanics by 2055 according to Pew Research Center. Growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations is predicted to almost triple over the next 40 years. By 2055, the breakdown is estimated to be 48% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, 16% Black, and 14% Asian.

, 14% of the United States&#x27; population is foreign born, compared to just 5% in 1965. Nearly 39 million immigrants have come to the U.S. since 1965, with most coming from Asia and Latin America. The 2015 Census Report predicts that the percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born will continue to increase, reaching 19% by 2060. This increase in the foreign-born population will account for a large share of the overall population growth.

The average person in the U.S. of 2060 is likely to be older than the average person of 2018 today, and it is projected that almost one in four people will be 65 or older.

===Self-reported ancestry===

This table displays all self-reported ancestries with over 50,000 members, alone or in combination, according to estimates from the 2022 American Community Survey. The total population of the US according to the survey was 333,287,550, and 251,732,240 people reported an ancestry. Of these, 175,054,020 reported a single ancestry, and 76,678,224 reported two or more ancestries. Hispanic groups are not distinguished between total and partial ancestry:
==Religion==
===Religious affiliations===

The table below is based mainly on selected data as reported to the United States Census Bureau. It only includes the voluntary self-reported membership of religious bodies with 750,000 or more. The definition of a member is determined by each religious body. , the US census bureau reported that about 13% of the population did not identify themselves as a member of any religion.

In a Pew Research Survey performed in 2012, Americans without a religion (atheists, agnostics, nothing in particular, etc.) approached the numbers of Evangelical Protestant Americans with almost 20% of Americans being nonreligious (compared to just over 26% being Evangelical Protestant). If this current growth rate continues, by 2050, around 51% of Americans will not have a religion.

Surveys conducted in 2014 and 2019 by Pew indicated that the percentage of Americans unaffiliated with a religion increased from 16% in 2007 to 23% in 2014 and 26% of the population in 2019.

According to statistical data made by the Pew Research Center in 2021 about 63% of the US population is Christian, 28% is Unaffiliated, 2% is Jewish, 1% follows Buddhism, 1% follows Hinduism, 1% follows Islam and 2% follow traditional religions and others. Currently, the United States has the largest Christian population in the world (approximately 230-250 million) and the largest Protestant Christian population (approximately 150-160 million). The country also has the second largest Jewish community in the world (after Israel) and the largest Buddhist and Hindu communities in the West, as well as the largest number of followers of Islam in North America. The country has about 64 million non-affiliates (only China and Japan have more).



According to Pew Research Center study released in 2018, by 2040, Islam will surpass Judaism to become the second largest religion in the US due to higher immigration and birth rates.

===Religions of U.S. adults===

The United States government does not collect religious data in its census. The survey below, the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone survey of 54,461 American residential households in the contiguous United States. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281.

Adult respondents were asked the open-ended question, &quot;What is your religion, if any?&quot;. Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was &quot;Protestant&quot; or &quot;Christian&quot; further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one-third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions.

Religious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008Figures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of &quot;no religion&quot; than any other group.



==LGBT population==

The 2000 U.S. Census counted same-sex couples in an oblique way; asking the sex and the relationship to the &quot;main householder&quot;, whose sex was also asked. Community Marketing &amp; Insights, an organization specializing in analyzing gay demographic data, reported, based on this count in the 2000 census and in the 2000 supplementary survey, that same-sex couples comprised between 1.0% and 1.1% of U.S. couples in 2000. A 2006 report issued by The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation concluded that the number of same-sex couples in the U.S. grew from 2000 to 2005, from nearly 600,000 couples in 2000 to almost 777,000 in 2005. A 2006 UCLA study reported that 4.1% of Americans aged 18–45 identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.

A 2011 report by the Williams Institute estimated that nine million adults identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, representing 3.5% of the population over 18. A spokesperson said that, until recently, few studies have tried to distinguish people who had occasionally undertaken homosexual behavior or entertained homosexual thoughts, from people who identified as lesbian or gay. (Older estimates have varied depending on methodology and timing; see Demographics of sexual orientation for a list of studies.)

==Migration==
===Immigration===

====Foreign-born population====

As of 2017, an estimated 44,525,458 residents of the United States were foreign-born, 13.5% of the country&#x27;s total population. This demographic includes recent as well as longstanding immigrants; statistically Europeans have resided in the US longer than those from other regions with approximately 66% having arrived prior to 2000.

====Immigration (2023)====

In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents (including many eligible to become citizens), 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants. Among current living immigrants to the U.S., the top five countries of birth are Mexico (25% of immigrants), China (6%), India (6%), the Philippines (5%) and El Salvador (3%). Some 13% of current living immigrants come from Europe and Canada, and 10% from the Caribbean. Among new arrivals, Asian immigrants have been more numerous than Hispanic immigrants since 2010; in 2017, 37.4% of immigrant arrivals were Asian, and 26.6% were Hispanic. Until 2017 and 2018, the United States led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined. From fiscal year 1980 until 2017, 55% of refugees came from Asia, 27% from Europe, 13% from Africa, and 4% from Latin America, fleeing war and persecution.

* Net migration rate* (2020-2021): 0.73 migrants/1,000 population.
*(mid-year estimates)

As of 2017, 13.6% (44.4 million) of the population was foreign born – an increase from 4.7% in 1970 but less than the 1890 record of 14.8%. Some 45% of the foreign born population were naturalized US citizens. Around 23% (10.3 million) of the foreign born community is undocumented, accounting for 3.2% of the total population. According to the 2010 census, Latin America and the Caribbean is the largest region-of-birth group, accounting for 53% of the foreign born population. As of 2018 this region is still the largest source of immigrants to the United States In 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S. born children of immigrants (second-generation Americans) in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population. In 2018, 1,096,611 immigrants were granted either permanent or temporary legal residence in the United States



===Emigration and Expatriation===

As of April 2015, the U.S. State Department estimated that 8.7 million American citizens live overseas. Americans living abroad are not counted in the U.S. Census unless they are federal government employees or dependents of a federal employee. A 2010 paper estimated the number of civilian Americans living abroad to be around 4 million. So-called &quot;accidental Americans&quot; are citizens of a country other than the United States who may also be considered U.S. citizens or be eligible for U.S. citizenship under specific laws but are not aware of having such status (or became aware of it only recently).

As of 2022, 1.6 million Americans live in Mexico, according to the State Department.

In 2020, the median household income in the United States was around $67,521, 2.9 percent less than the 2019 median of $69,560. Household and personal income depends on variables such as race, number of income earners, educational attainment and marital status.



===Economic class===

Social classes in the United States lack distinct boundaries and may overlap. Even their existence (when distinguished from economic strata) is controversial. The following table provides a summary of some prominent academic theories on the stratification of American society:
===Unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted)===

The U6 unemployment rate was 8.6 percent. The U6 unemployment rate counts not only people without work seeking full-time employment (the more familiar U3 rate), but also counts &quot;marginally attached workers and those working part-time for economic reasons.&quot; Some of these part-time workers counted as employed by U6 could be working as little as an hour a week. And the &quot;marginally attached workers&quot; include those who have become discouraged and stopped looking, but still want to work. The age considered for this calculation is 16 years and over.

Urban Americans have more job opportunities than those in more rural areas. From 2008 to 2018, 72% of the nation&#x27;s employment growth occurred in cities with more than one million residents, which account for 56% of the overall population.

==Generational cohorts==
A definitive recent study of US generational cohorts was done by Schuman and Scott (2012) in which a broad sample of adults of all ages was asked, &quot;What world events are especially important to you?&quot; They found that 33 events were mentioned with great frequency. When the ages of the respondents were correlated with the expressed importance rankings, seven (some put 8 or 9) distinct cohorts became evident.

Today the following descriptors are frequently used for these cohorts:
===U.S. demographic birth cohorts===
Subdivided groups are present when peak boom years or inverted peak bust years are present, and may be represented by a normal or inverted bell-shaped curve (rather than a straight curve). The boom subdivided cohorts may be considered as &quot;pre-peak&quot; (including peak year) and &quot;post-peak&quot;. The year 1957 was the baby boom peak with 4.3 million births and 122.7 fertility rate. Although post-peak births (such as trailing edge boomers) are in decline, and sometimes referred to as a &quot;bust&quot;, there are still a &quot;relatively&quot; large number of births. The dearth-in-birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year, and those including and beyond, leading up to the subsequent normal birth rate. The baby boom began around 1943 to 1946.

From the decline in U.S. birth rates starting in 1958 and the introduction of the birth control pill in 1960, the Baby Boomer normal distribution curve is negatively skewed. The trend in birth rates from 1958 to 1961 show a tendency to end late in the decade at approximately 1969, thus returning to pre-WWII levels, with 12 years of rising and 12 years of declining birth rates. Pre-war birth rates were defined as anywhere between 1939 and 1941 by demographers such as the Taeuber&#x27;s, Philip M. Hauser and William Fielding Ogburn.

==Mobility==
In 2021, 27.1 million Americans said they were living in a different place than a year before, compared to 29.8 million in 2020. This reflects an 8.4% mover rate, the lowest recorded in more than 70 years.

<text>Genipa is a genus of trees in the family Rubiaceae. This genus is native to the American tropical forests.

==Description==
Tall trees, without any spines, prickles or thorns; with large opposite leaves of almost leathery texture, smooth or hairy. Presence of interpetiolar stipules, triangle-shaped. The large flowers are arranged in terminal cymes; the calyx is tubular, while the corolla can be trumpet-shaped or short-cylindrical, with 5-6 lobes. The stamens are located at the top of the corolla. The fruit is an almost globose or ovoid berry, smooth, fleshy, with a thick rind. The seeds are large and flat.

==Taxonomy==
The species from Madagascar, originally described by Drake, do not belong to the Rubiaceae tribe Gardenieae like the New World &quot;Genipa&quot; species, but in the tribe Octotropideae. Those species were transferred to the genus &quot;Hyperacanthus&quot;.

&quot;Genipa spruceana&quot; is considered doubtfully distinct from &quot;Genipa americana&quot;.

Species currently recognized in &quot;Genipa&quot; are:
* &quot;Genipa americana&quot; 
* &quot;Genipa infundibuliformis&quot; 
* &quot;Genipa spruceana&quot; 

== Distribution and habitat ==
The genus is native to the tropical forests of America, including Florida.

<doc id="70201" wikidata="Q512187" url="?curid=70201" title="Federal republic">
<text>A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader, such as a president, rather than by a monarch or any hereditary aristocracy.

In a federal republic, a division of powers exists between the federal government and the government of the individual subdivisions. While each federal republic manages this division of powers differently, common matters relating to international affairs and treaties, security and defense, inter-state relations, and monetary policy are usually handled at the federal level, while matters such as infrastructure maintenance and education policy are usually handled at the regional or local level; however, views differ on what issues should be a federal competence, and subdivisions usually have sovereignty in some matters where the federal government does not have jurisdiction. A federal republic is thus best defined in contrast to a unitary republic, whereby the central government has complete sovereignty over all aspects of political life. This more decentralized structure helps to explain the tendency for more populous countries to operate as federal republics.

Most federal republics codify the division of powers between orders of government in a written constitutional document. The political differences between a federal republic and other federal states, especially federal monarchies under a parliamentary system of government, are largely a matter of legal form rather than political substance, as most federal states are democratic in structure if not practice with checks and balances; however, some federal monarchies, such as the United Arab Emirates, are based upon principles other than democracy.

Federal states primarily contrast with unitary states, where the central government retains many of the powers that are delegated to the subdivisions in federal republics. While there are exceptions, the overall tendency is for federal republics to be larger, more populous, and more internally heterogeneous than unitary states, with such larger size and internal heterogeneity being more manageable in a federal system than in a unitary one.

<doc id="70206" wikidata="Q3902680" url="?curid=70206" title="Picnic at Hanging Rock (novel)">
<text>Picnic at Hanging Rock is a 1967 historical fiction novel by Australian author Joan Lindsay. Set in Victoria, Australia in 1900, it is about a group of female boarding school students who vanish at Hanging Rock while on a Valentine&#x27;s Day picnic, and the effects the disappearances have on the school and local community.

The novel was first published in Australia by Cheshire Publishing and was reprinted by Penguin in 1975. It is widely considered by critics to be one of the greatest Australian novels. In 2022, it was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

It was adapted into a 1975 film of the same name, directed by Peter Weir.

==Overview==
Although the events depicted in the novel are entirely fictional, it is framed as though it were a true story, corroborated by ambiguous pseudohistorical references. Its unresolved conclusion has sparked significant public, critical, and scholarly analysis, and the narrative has become a part of Australia&#x27;s national folklore as a result. Lindsay claimed to have written the novel over two weeks at her home Mulberry Hill in Baxter, on Victoria&#x27;s Mornington Peninsula, after having successive dreams of the narrated events.

An excised final chapter of the novel was published posthumously as part of a book titled &quot;The Secret of Hanging Rock&quot;, which also included critical commentary and theories about the novel. Another book, titled &quot;The Murders at Hanging Rock&quot;, was published in 1980, proposing varying other interpretations. The novel has been adapted into other media, most famously in the 1975 critically well-received film of the same name by director Peter Weir.

==Plot==
The novel begins with a brief foreword stating that whether the novel &quot;is fact or fiction, my readers must decide for themselves&quot; and implying that the events occurred.

At Appleyard College, a private boarding school for upper-class girls near Mount Macedon, Victoria, a picnic is being planned for the pupils under the supervision of Mrs Appleyard, the school&#x27;s headmistress. The picnic entails a day trip to Hanging Rock, on St Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1900. One of the pupils, Sara, who is in trouble with Mrs Appleyard, is not allowed to go. Sara&#x27;s close friend Miranda goes without her. When they arrive the pupils relax and eat lunch. Afterwards Miranda goes to climb the monolith with classmates Edith, Irma and Marion despite being forbidden to do so. The girls&#x27; mathematics teacher, Greta McCraw, follows behind them separately. Miranda, Marion and Irma climb still higher in a trance-like state while Edith flees in terror; she returns to the picnic in hysterics, disoriented and with no memory of what occurred. Miss McCraw cannot be accounted for either except for being seen by Edith, who passed her ascending the rock in her underwear. The school scours the rock in search of the three girls and their teacher but they are not found.

The disappearances provoke much local concern and international sensation with rape, abduction, and murder being assumed as probable explanations. Several organized searches of the picnic grounds and the area surrounding the rock itself turn up nothing. Meanwhile the pupils, teachers and other staff of the school, as well as members of the community, grapple with the riddle-like events. Mike Fitzhubert, an Englishman who was picnicking at the grounds the same day, embarks on a private search of the rock and discovers Irma, unconscious and on the verge of death. When he fails to return from his search, he is found in an unexplained daze, sitting at the rock with Irma, by his friend and uncle&#x27;s coachman, Albert Crundall.

Concerned parents begin withdrawing their daughters from the prestigious school, prompting various staff to leave; the handyman and maid quit their jobs, and the French instructor, Mlle Dianne de Poitiers, announces that she will be getting married and leaving as well. A junior governess at the school, Dora Lumley, also leaves with her brother Reg, only for both to be killed in a hotel fire. Amidst the unrest both in and around the school Sara vanishes, only to be found days later, having apparently died by suicide (her body being found right beneath the school&#x27;s tower, with her head &quot;crushed beyond recognition&quot;). Mrs Appleyard, distraught over the events that have occurred, kills herself by jumping from a peak on Hanging Rock.

In a pseudo-historical afterword purportedly extracted from a 1913 Melbourne newspaper article, it is written that both the school and the Woodend Police Station, where records of the investigation were kept, were destroyed by a bush fire in the summer of 1901. In 1903 rabbit hunters came across a lone piece of frilled calico at the rock, believed to have been part of the dress of the governess, Miss Greta McCraw, but neither she nor the girls were ever found.

===Excised final chapter===
According to her editor, Sandra Forbes, Lindsay&#x27;s original draft of the novel included a final chapter in which the mystery was resolved. At her editor&#x27;s suggestion Lindsay removed it prior to publication. Chapter Eighteen, as it is known, was published posthumously as a standalone book in 1987 as The Secret of Hanging Rock by Angus &amp; Robertson Publishing.

The chapter opens with Edith fleeing back to the picnic area while Miranda, Irma, and Marion push on. Each girl begins to experience dizziness and feel as if she is &quot;being pulled from the inside out.&quot; A woman suddenly appears climbing the rock in her underwear, shouting &quot;Through!&quot;, and then faints. This woman is not referred to by name and is apparently a stranger to the girls, yet the narration suggests she is Miss McCraw. Miranda loosens the woman&#x27;s corset to help revive her. Afterwards the girls remove their own corsets and throw them off the cliff. The recovered woman points out that the corsets appear to hover in mid-air as if stuck in time and that they cast no shadows. She and the girls continue together. The girls then encounter what is described as &quot;a hole in space&quot;, by which they physically enter a crack in the rock following a lizard; the unnamed woman disappears into the rock. Marion follows her, then Miranda, but when Irma&#x27;s turn comes a balanced boulder (the hanging rock) slowly tilts and blocks the way. The chapter ends with Irma &quot;tearing and beating at the gritty face on the boulder with her bare hands.&quot;
The missing material amounts to about 12 pages; the remainder of the publication &quot;The Secret at Hanging Rock&quot; contains discussion by other authors, including John Taylor and Yvonne Rousseau. The suspension of the corsets and description of the hole in space suggest that the girls have encountered some sort of time warp, which is compatible with Lindsay&#x27;s fascination with and emphasis on clocks and time in the novel.

==Conception==

Lindsay claimed to have based the novel on an idea she had in a dream. In a 2017 article in &quot;The Age&quot; it was noted: &quot;The dream had centred on a summer picnic at a place called Hanging Rock, which Joan knew well from her childhood holidays. Joan told Rae [her housekeeper] that the dream had felt so real that when she awoke at 7.30am, she could still feel the hot summer breeze blowing through the gum trees and she could still hear the peals of laughter and conversation of the people she&#x27;d imagined, and their gaiety and lightness of spirit as they set out on their joyful picnic expedition.&quot;

According to her housekeeper at the time, the events of the novel were dreamt by Lindsay successively. Several years after the publication of the novel, Lindsay would recount the experience of writing it as such: &quot;&quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; really was an experience to write, because I was just impossible when I was writing it. I just sort of thought about it all night and in the morning I would go straight up and sit on the floor, papers all around me, and just write like a demon!&quot;

The novel was written over a total of two weeks at Lindsay&#x27;s home in Mulberry Hill. In thinking of a title, Lindsay recalled the painting &quot;At the Hanging Rock&quot; by William Ford, which had hung in her husband Daryl&#x27;s office at the National Gallery of Victoria, and chose to incorporate it into the title as it was &quot;simple and pretty, and belied the horrors hidden within.&quot; In an interview after Lindsay&#x27;s death, academic Terrence O&#x27;Neill, who had befriended Lindsay, remarked the supernatural elements of the novel: &quot;It was clear that [Joan] was interested in Spiritualism, and longed for some spiritual dimension in her life, but she didn&#x27;t feel safe bringing that side of her out in front of her husband. So I think she channelled it into her writing. I know she was very interested in Arthur Conan Doyle and his belief in and theories about Spiritualism, nature and the existence of spirits.&quot;

The novel was imported for sale in the United States and would receive its first publication there in 2014 by Penguin Random House. In the United Kingdom the novel was printed in several editions by Vintage, in 1998 and 2013.

==Basis in reality==

&quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; is written in the form of a true story, and even begins and ends with a pseudohistorical prologue and epilogue, reinforcing the mystery that has generated significant critical and public interest since its publication in 1967. However, while the geological feature, Hanging Rock, and the several towns mentioned are actual places near Mount Macedon, the story itself is entirely fictitious. Lindsay had done little to dispel the myth that the story is based on truth, in many interviews either refusing to confirm it was entirely fiction, or hinting that parts of the book were fictitious and that others were not. The dates named in the novel do not correspond to actual dates in the 1900 calendar. For instance, Valentine&#x27;s Day, 14 February 1900, occurred on a Wednesday, not a Saturday; similarly, Easter Sunday fell on 15 April in 1900, not on 29 March.

Appleyard College was to some extent based on Clyde Girls&#x27; Grammar School at St Kilda East, Victoria, which Joan Lindsay attended as a day-girl while in her teens. Incidentally, in 1919 this school was transferred to the town of Woodend, Victoria, about 8 km southwest of Hanging Rock. The fictional site of the college was described in the book as having an eastward view of Mount Macedon on the Bendigo Road. This would place it roughly 5.8 km south of Woodend. The total trip to Hanging Rock was about 12 km.
When asked in a 1974 interview about whether or not the novel was based in truth, Lindsay responded: &quot;Well, it was written as a mystery and it remains a mystery. If you can draw your own conclusions, that&#x27;s fine, but I don&#x27;t think that it matters. I wrote that book as a sort of atmosphere of a place, and it was like dropping a stone into the water. I felt that story, if you call it a story—that the thing that happened on St. Valentine&#x27;s Day went on spreading, out and out and out, in circles.&quot; The unresolved mystery of the disappearances in the novel aroused so much lasting public interest that in 1980 a book of hypothetical solutions (by Yvonne Rousseau) was published, called &quot;The Murders at Hanging Rock&quot;.

==Publication history==
The novel was first published on 1 November 1967 by F. W. Cheshire, Melbourne, under the aegis of Andrew Fabinyi, with an acclaimed &quot;dream-like&quot; cover design by Alison Forbes. It was reprinted in paperback by Penguin Books&#x27; Australian division in 1975, printed in conjunction with the release of the film adaptation. A hardback illustrated edition was also printed in Australia in 1987, also by Penguin. It would receive another reprinting by Penguin Books Australia in 2013 as part of the &quot;Penguin Australian Classics&quot; series.

==Critical analysis==
Much of the critical and scholarly interest in the novel has centred on its mysterious conclusion, as well as its depiction of Australia&#x27;s natural environment in contrast with the Victorian population of the British colony established in 1851. In 1987, literary scholar Donald Bartlett drew comparisons between Lindsay&#x27;s treatment of the rock and that of the fictitious Marabar Caves in E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, which has been interpreted as a metaphor for Pan, the Greek god of the wild: &quot;There is more, of course, to &quot;A Passage to India&quot; than Pan motifs, for example symbols such as the snake, the wasp and the undying worm, not to mention the vast panorama of India&#x27;s religions. But I believe it probable that Joan Lindsay consciously borrowed the elements [from &quot;A Passage to India&quot;].&quot;

Literary scholar Kathleen Steele argues in her essay &quot;Fear and Loathing in the Australian Bush: Gothic Landscapes in &quot;Bush Studies&quot; and &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot;&quot; that the novel&#x27;s treatment of landscape and its missing characters is reflective of Australia&#x27;s national history and the relationship between the rock and the Aboriginal population: &quot;The silence surrounding Aborigines, and the manner in which Europeans foregrounded &#x27;geographical, historical and cultural difference and discontinuity,&#x27; yet denied Aborigines either presence or history, created a gothic consciousness of &#x27;something deeply unknowable and terrifying in the Australian landscape.&#x27;&quot; ... &quot;Lindsay provokes a reflection on the understanding of Australia as an un-peopled land where nothing of consequence occurred until the British gave it a history.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===Film===
The first film adaptation of the book was a short by Tony Ingram, a fourteen-year-old filmmaker, who got permission from Joan Lindsay to adapt her book as &quot;The Day of Saint Valentine.&quot; However, only about ten minutes of footage was filmed before the rights were optioned to Peter Weir for his more famous feature-length version, and the production was permanently shelved. The completed footage is included on some DVD releases of Weir&#x27;s film.

The feature film version of &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; premiered at the Hindley Cinema Complex in Adelaide on 8 August 1975. It became an early film of the Australian New Wave and is arguably Australia&#x27;s first international hit film.

===Theatre===
&quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; was adapted by playwright Laura Annawyn Shamas in 1987 and published by Dramatic Publishing Company. Subsequently, it has had many productions in the US, Canada, and Australia. There have also been musical adaptations of the novel.

In 2007 a youth musical adaptation by Robert Johns (adapter) and Brian Spence (composer) premiered at Chichester&#x27;s Minerva Theatre in West Sussex, UK.

A stage-musical adaptation, with book, music, and lyrics by Daniel Zaitchik, was scheduled to open in New York City in the fall of 2012. The musical received a 2007 staged reading at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center, and further workshop development at the 2009 O&#x27;Neill Theater Center National Music Theater Conference. The musical had its world premiere on 28 February 2014 at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah under the direction of Jim Christian.

In 2016, the Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne showed a stage adaptation dramatized by Tom Wright and directed by Matthew Lutton. The production was later staged at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh, Scotland in January 2017. The overseas production worked alongside the original Australian theatre makers Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne as well as Black Swan State Theatre Company. The Malthouse Theatre presented an encore season of &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; in early 2018.

===Radio===
An abridged form of the book was read by New Zealand actress Lisa Harrow on BBC Radio Four in 1996 in its Book at Bedtime slot. In 2010, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation. The cast included Simon Burke, Penny Downie, Anna Skellern and Andi Snelling.

===Miniseries===

On 6 September 2016, it was announced that Fremantle Media and pay-TV broadcaster Foxtel were producing a six-part miniseries, to be broadcast in 2017. The miniseries became available on Amazon Prime streaming on 25 May 2018.

<doc id="70208" wikidata="Q312381" url="?curid=70208" title="Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley">
<text>Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley (1546 – 10 February 1567) was King of Scotland as the second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, from 29 July 1565 until his murder in 1567. Lord Darnley had one child with Mary, the future James VI of Scotland and I of England. Through his parents, he had claims to both the Scottish and English thrones. Less than a year after the birth of his son, Darnley was murdered at Kirk o&#x27; Field in 1567. Many contemporary narratives describing his life and death refer to him as simply &quot;Lord Darnley&quot;, his title as heir apparent to the Earldom of Lennox.

==Origins==
He was the second but eldest surviving son of Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, by his wife Lady Margaret Douglas, which supported his claim to the English succession. Darnley&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, and Queen Margaret Tudor, daughter of King Henry VII of England and widow of King James IV of Scotland.

==Early life==

Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley was born at Temple Newsam, Leeds, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, in 1546. Henry was initially believed to be born on 5 December 1545, but more recent research suggests he was born in 1546, as his mother had given birth in late February 1545. In a letter from March 1566, his age was given as nineteen. 

In 1545, his father, Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, was found guilty of treason in Scotland for siding with the English in the War of the Rough Wooing, in opposing Mary of Guise and Regent Arran. The family&#x27;s Scottish estates were forfeited and his father went into exile in England for 22 years, returning to Scotland in 1564. The Countess of Lennox Margaret Douglas, his mother, had left Scotland in 1528.

The Scottish scholar John Elder was among his tutors. Elder advocated Anglo-Scottish union through the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Prince Edward. His advice to Henry VIII in 1543, was termed the &quot;Advice of a Redshank&quot;. Another schoolmaster to the young heir was Arthur Lallart, who would later be interrogated in London for having gone to Scotland in 1562.

Henry was considered strong, athletic, skilled in horsemanship and weaponry, and passionate about hunting and hawking. His youthful character is captured somewhat in a letter of March 1554 to Mary I of England from Temple Newsam, where he writes about making a map, the &quot;Utopia Nova&quot;, and his wish that &quot;every haire in my heade for to be a wourthy souldiour&quot;. In Scotland, he was delighted with an English Water Spaniel, a gift from the courtier James Melville of Halhill.

==Succession crisis==
There was a political dilemma in England arising from the dynastic ambition of the Lennoxes: Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, was third in line to the Scottish throne, and his wife Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox, was a niece of Henry VIII, making her a potential successor to the English throne if Elizabeth should die. As Roman Catholics, they posed a threat to English Protestants. Although Elizabeth was bright, witty, and well-educated for her position, as a female she had to prove herself. As she was a Protestant, many Roman Catholics would have liked to see the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, take the throne. They regarded Elizabeth as illegitimate, her parents&#x27; marriage not having been recognised by the Catholic Church. As a male descended from Henry VII, Darnley was also a contender for the English throne—these interrelationships made for complex intrigues, spying, strategising, and manoeuvering for power at the various courts.

When Henry II of France died in July 1559, Lennox&#x27;s brother John, 5th Sieur d&#x27;Aubigny, was elevated in the French court as a relative of the new French queen, Mary, already Queen of Scots. Aubigny arranged for Darnley to be dispatched to the French court to congratulate Mary and Francis II of France on Francis&#x27;s accession and seek restoration for Lennox. Mary did not restore Lennox to his Scottish earldom. Still, she did give 1,000 crowns to Darnley and invited him to her coronation. Lennox planned to appeal directly to the Queen of Scots via her ambassador, over the heads of Elizabeth and the Guise. The mission of Lennox&#x27;s agent, one Nesbit, appears to have been a desperate one; not only was Lennox willing to hand over Darnley and his brother Charles as hostages for his restoration, but he supplied pedigrees of Darnley, indicating his right to the inheritance of England and Scotland and the houses of Hamilton and Douglas. Aubigny was also later accused of supporting Mary&#x27;s title to the throne of England and hinting that even his nephew had a stronger claim than Elizabeth.

Lennox set Nesbit to watch Mary, Darnley, and Darnley&#x27;s tutor, John Elder. In 1559 Nicholas Throckmorton, the English ambassador in Paris, warned Elizabeth that Elder was &quot;as dangerous for the matters of England as any he knew.&quot; Lord Paget in March 1560, wrote of the &#x27;well founded&#x27; fear that Catholics would raise Darnley to the throne on Elizabeth&#x27;s death.

Francis Yaxley was a Catholic spy discovered in 1562 whose activities led to the arrest of the Lennox family. He had been a Clerk of the Signet and from 1549 was employed by William Cecil travelling in France. Yaxley was employed by the Countess of Lennox. He placed Mabel Fortescue and other ladies as servants in the Lennox household at Settrington in November 1560. His interrogation at the Tower of London in February 1562 revealed that he had obtained intelligence about the English Court from the Spanish ambassador, and the ambassador had entrusted him and Hugh Allen with messages and tokens for the Lennoxes and Darnley. Yaxley admitted that his missions were intended to arrange the marriage of the Queen of Scots with Darnley, that Darnley&#x27;s religion guaranteed him greater success in his suit than the Earl of Arran, and that the countess had many friends in the north. Although the Lennox threat never died out, Elizabeth did not convict the family of treason in 1562 after their arrest, nor did she encourage efforts to annul the countess&#x27;s claim to her throne. Perhaps Elizabeth feared that these investigations could also be directed at herself, or her inaction was intended to ensure the monarchy&#x27;s survival by not reducing the number of potential heirs. The Lennox family was released in February 1563. Within a few months, Darnley and his mother were conspicuous by their presence at Court and the favour they received there, although Elizabeth would not accommodate the earl at Court.

Sarah Macauley notes three outcomes of the court&#x27;s decision in the Lennox trial:&quot;Their elevation at Court was, as it turned out in 1563, a useful complication in the succession issue. First, it presented a public statement that the preferences of Parliament (the claim of Catherine Grey in the succession crisis) could not dictate her own policy. Secondly, favouring the Lennoxes could serve as some kind of appeasement of the English Roman Catholics, who, like the Spanish ambassador, might foresee Elizabeth naming Darnley as her successor ... Such speculation would also distract them from favouring the more alarming claim of the Queen of Scots ... Thirdly, and most significantly, the elevation of the Lennoxes presented an obstacle between the Queen of Scots and the English throne. Thus was Darnley&#x27;s uniquely &#x27;British&#x27; inheritance put to use at last ... The subsequent release of Darnley into Scotland and the restoration of his father at the Scottish Court were part of this policy: the political disaster of the Darnley marriage as yet unforeseen.&quot;
In September 1564, the Scottish Parliament restored Matthew Stewart&#x27;s rights and titles as Earl of Lennox, and listened to a lengthy speech from the Queen&#x27;s secretary William Maitland, who offered;&quot;[I]t may be affirmid Scotland in na manis age that presentlie levis wes in gritter tranquillitie.&quot;

==Marriage to Mary, Queen of Scots==

On 3 February 1565, Darnley left London; by 12 February, he was in Edinburgh. On 17 February, he presented himself to Mary at Wemyss Castle in Fife. James Melville of Halhill reported that &quot;Her Majesty took well with him, and said that he was the lustiest and best proportioned long man that she had seen.&quot; After a brief visit to his father at Dunkeld, Darnley returned with Mary and the court to Holyrood on 24 February. The next day, he heard John Knox preach, and he danced a galliard with Mary at night. He was constantly in Mary&#x27;s company from then on.

Darnley was his wife&#x27;s half-first cousin through two different marriages of their grandmother, Margaret Tudor, putting Mary and Darnley high in the line of succession for the English throne. Darnley was also a descendant of a daughter of James II of Scotland, and so also in line for the throne of Scotland.

As a preliminary to the marriage, Darnley was made a knight, Lord of Ardmanoch and Earl of Ross at Stirling Castle on 15 May 1565. An entourage of 15 men were made knights, including one of Mary&#x27;s half brothers, Robert Stewart of Strathdon, Robert Drummond of Carnock, James Stewart of Doune Castle, and William Murray of Tullibardine. In England, a concerned Privy council debated the perils of the intended marriage on 4 June. One of their resolutions was to relax the displeasure shown to Lady Catherine Grey, another rival to Mary Stuart for the English throne. Mary sent John Hay, Commendator of Balmerino, to speak to Elizabeth; Elizabeth demanded Darnley&#x27;s return and gave John Hay plainly to understand her small satisfaction.

On 22 July, Darnley was made Duke of Albany in Holyrood Abbey, and the banns of marriage were called in the parish of Canongate. A proclamation was made at the Cross of Edinburgh on 28 July 1565 that government would be in the joint names of the king and queen of Scots, thus making Darnley king and giving him equality with and precedence over Mary. This was confirmed in the circulation of a silver ryal in the names of Henry and Mary.

On 29 July 1565, the marriage took place by Roman Catholic rites in Mary&#x27;s private chapel at Holyrood, but Darnley (whose religious beliefs were unfixed – he was raised as a Catholic, but was later influenced by Protestantism) refused to accompany Mary to the nuptial Mass after the wedding. Because they were both first cousins, a papal dispensation was needed for the marriage, which was initially celebrated without the dispensation because the Holy See delayed issuing it. It was not until 25 September that Rome issued the dispensation, thus validating the marriage between Mary and Darnley.

The marriage union between Mary and Darnley provoked the wrath of Elizabeth because the Queen considered that Darnley, who, despite being Scottish, was born and raised in England and, therefore, was her subject, had married without her permission. The marriage also posed a serious threat to Elizabeth: both Darnley and Mary had claims to the English throne as descendants of Henry VII, the first monarch of the reigning House of Tudor, and the English Catholics considered Mary to be the rightful heir to the throne, rather than Elizabeth who was Protestant. Furthermore, any son they might have would be a clear claimant to the throne of England.

In retaliation for Henry&#x27;s marriage, Elizabeth ordered the imprisonment of her first cousin and Darnley&#x27;s mother, Lady Margaret, in the Tower of London. Margaret remained imprisoned in the Tower until she was freed shortly after her son&#x27;s murder.

The marriage between Mary and the son of Scotland&#x27;s premier Catholic nobleman alarmed the Protestant nobility, precipitating the Queen&#x27;s half-brother, James Stewart, Earl of Moray, along with the earls of Argyll, Glencairn, and Rothes to take up arms against the Queen. Protestant noblemen were worried that the marriage would mean Scotland would take a turn towards Catholicism. The rebellion, known as the Chaseabout Raid, was soon defeated by the royal forces, and Moray was forced to escape to England, where he sought Elizabeth&#x27;s asylum.

==Estrangement==

Soon after Mary married Darnley, she became aware of his vain, arrogant, and unreliable qualities, which threatened the state&#x27;s well-being. Darnley was unpopular with the other nobles and had a violent streak, aggravated by his drinking. Mary refused to grant Darnley the Crown Matrimonial, which would have made him the successor to the throne if she died childless. By August 1565, less than a month after the marriage, William Cecil heard that Darnley&#x27;s insolence had driven Lennox from the Scottish court. On 28 August 1565, a pair of diplomatic letters were sent from the Scottish court to the King of Denmark, one signed by Mary, the other by Darnley. This seems to have been an effort to confirm his royal status. Mary soon became pregnant.

As a token of friendship, Charles IX of France sent an ambassador, Nicolas d&#x27;Angennes, seigneur de Rambouillet, to invest Darnley in the Order of Saint Michael in February 1566. Mary, Darnley, and her private secretary David Rizzio, took part in a costly masque with seven other dancers in rich attire to welcome Rambouillet and celebrate Darnley&#x27;s investiture. His costume for the ceremony in the chapel of Holyroodhouse, of satin guarded with black velvet and satin, sewn with aglets of gold, was given to a French herald as a perquisite.

David Rizzio was stabbed 57 times on 9 March 1566 by Darnley and his confederates, Protestant Scottish nobles, in the presence of the queen, who was six months pregnant. According to English diplomats Thomas Randolph and the Earl of Bedford, the murder of Rizzio (who was rumoured to be the father of Mary&#x27;s unborn child) was part of Darnley&#x27;s bid to force Mary to cede the Crown Matrimonial. Darnley also bargained with his allies to advance his claim to the Crown Matrimonial in the Parliament of Scotland in return for restoring their lands and titles.

When the Spanish Ambassador in Paris heard this news, the headlines were that Darnley &quot;had murdered his wife, admitted the exiled heretics, and seized the kingdom.&quot; However, on 20 March, Darnley posted a declaration denying all knowledge of or complicity in the Rizzio murder. 
Mary no longer trusted her husband, and he was disgraced by the kingdom. On 27 March, the Earl of Morton and Lord Ruthven, who were both present at Rizzio&#x27;s murder and had fled to England, wrote to Cecil claiming that Darnley had initiated the murder plot and recruited them, because of his &quot;heich quarrel&quot; and &quot;deadly hatred&quot; of Rizzio.

==Birth of son==

Mary and Darnley&#x27;s son James (the future King James VI of Scotland and I of England) was born on 19 June 1566 at Edinburgh Castle.

Following the birth of James, the succession was more secure, but Darnley and Mary&#x27;s marriage continued to struggle, despite a hunting trip together to Cramalt Tower in the Ettrick Forest in August 1566. Darnley alienated many who would otherwise have been his supporters through his erratic behaviour. His insistence that he be awarded the Crown Matrimonial was still a source of marital frustration.

Their son was baptised Charles James on 17 December 1566 in a Catholic ceremony held at Stirling Castle. His godparents were Charles IX of France, Elizabeth I of England and Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy. Mary refused to let the Archbishop of St Andrews, whom she referred to as &quot;a pocky priest&quot;, spit in the child&#x27;s mouth, as was then the custom. In the entertainment, devised by Frenchman Bastian Pagez, men danced dressed as satyrs and sporting tails; the English guests took offence, thinking the satyrs &quot;done against them&quot;. The French ambassador described how Darnley was lodged in the castle but stayed in his rooms, and sensing he was out of favour, the ambassador refused to meet with him.

==Death==
Darnley was murdered eight months after James&#x27;s birth. On the night of 9/10 February 1567, his body and that of his valet were discovered in the orchard of Kirk o&#x27; Field, in Edinburgh, where they had been staying. During the weeks leading up to his death, Darnley was recovering from a bout of smallpox (or, it has been speculated, syphilis). He was described as having deformed pocks upon his face and body. He stayed with his family in Glasgow until Mary brought him to recuperate at Old Provost&#x27;s lodging at Kirk o&#x27; Field, a two-storey house within the church quadrangle, a short walk from Holyrood, to incorporate him into the court again. Darnley stayed at Kirk o&#x27; Field while Mary attended the wedding of Bastian Pagez, one of her closest servants, at Holyrood.

Around on the night of 9/10 February 1567, while Mary was away, two explosions rocked the foundation of Kirk o&#x27; Field. These explosions were later attributed to two barrels of gunpowder that had been placed in the small room under Darnley&#x27;s sleeping quarters. Darnley&#x27;s body and the body of his valet, William Taylor, were found outside, surrounded by a cloak, a dagger, a chair, and a coat. Darnley was dressed only in his nightshirt, suggesting he had hurriedly fled from his bedchamber. Darnley was smothered. There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body. A post-mortem revealed internal injuries thought to have been caused by the explosion. John Knox claimed that the surgeons who examined the body were lying and that Darnley had been strangled, but all the sources agreed there were no marks on the body and there was no reason for the surgeons to lie as Darnley was murdered either way.

==Aftermath==

Suspicion quickly fell on James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, and his supporters, notably Archibald Douglas, Parson of Douglas, whose shoes were found at the scene, and on Mary herself. Bothwell had long been suspected of having designs on the throne, and his close relationship with the queen gave rise to rumours they were sexually intimate. This was viewed as a motive for Bothwell to have Darnley murdered, with help from some of the nobility and seemingly with royal approval. Mary had been looking at options for removing Darnley and had discussed ideas at Craigmillar Castle in November 1566, though her ideas were for divorce. The problem was the risk of making her son illegitimate.

Soon after Darnley&#x27;s death, Bothwell and Mary left Edinburgh together. There are two points of view about the circumstances: in the first, Bothwell kidnapped the queen, took her to Dunbar Castle, and raped her. In the second, Mary was a willing participant in the kidnapping, and the story of rape was a fabrication, so her honour and reputation were not ruined by her marriage to a man widely suspected of murder. Mary later miscarried twins by Bothwell while a prisoner at Lochleven Castle.

A soldier under the pay of Bothwell, Captain William Blackadder of the Clan Blackadder, was one of the first non-participants to happen upon the scene and, for that reason, was treated as a suspect. He was convicted and executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered before each of his limbs was nailed to the gates of a different Scottish town.

Bothwell was put on trial in Edinburgh and found not guilty. Suspicions that Mary colluded with conspirators in her husband&#x27;s death or that she took no action to prevent his death led to the loss of her supporters and the loss of the Scottish crown. Bothwell escaped to Shetland and Norway. Her enemies captured Mary at the battle of Carberry Hill. In 1568, Mary&#x27;s involvement in the murder was discussed in England in conferences at York and Westminster, which ended with no definitive findings. The Casket letters were produced as evidence against her, alleged to have been written by Mary; they seemed to indicate her support for the killing. The letters were purportedly found by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, in Edinburgh, in a silver box engraved with an &quot;F&quot; (for Francis II), along with other documents, including the Mary-Bothwell marriage certificate. Before Morton&#x27;s execution in 1581, he admitted knowing the murder plot, and that Bothwell and Archibald Douglas were &quot;chief actors&quot; in Darnley&#x27;s murder.

Mary fled to England but was kept in captivity there until she was implicated in the Babington plot against Elizabeth, after which she was convicted of treason and executed.

== Burial and missing remains ==
Darnley was buried in the Royal Vault at Holyrood Abbey in 1567 alongside the bodies of several royals: King James II, Arthur, Duke of Rothesay, Madeleine of Valois, James, Duke of Rothesay, Arthur, Duke of Albany and King James V. In 1668, the vault was opened by mobs, and sometime later (between 1776 and 1778), the vault was raided, and the skull of Lord Darnley was stolen.

In 1928, a paper was published by Karl Pearson, detailing his vast research into the skull of Lord Darnley. In his paper, Pearson discussed the possibility of Darnley&#x27;s skull residing in the Royal College of Surgeons’ museum. In 2016, at the request of the University of Edinburgh, research was undertaken to identify whether a skull once held in the university&#x27;s collection (until destroyed in the Blitz) could be Darnley&#x27;s stolen remains. The Royal College of Surgeons&#x27; skull and detailed pictures and measurements from 1928 of the destroyed Edinburgh skull were examined and compared to portraits of Darnley by Emma Price at the University of Dundee. The conclusion was that the Edinburgh skull could not be Darnley&#x27;s, but the Royal College of Surgeons&#x27; one was a good match. A historical facial reconstruction was then produced.

==Sexuality==
Darnley&#x27;s sexuality has been subject to debate. While at the Court of Elizabeth I, he was described as &quot;a great cock chick&quot;, and Thomas Randolph (Elizabeth I&#x27;s ambassador to Scotland) in a later despatch wrote that Darnley and Rizzio &quot;would lie sometimes in one bed together&quot;. A sexual relationship between Darnley and Rizzio was depicted in both the 1971 film &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; and the 2018 film, &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot;. 

==Honours==
* February 1565: Order of Saint Michael, awarded by King Charles IX of France.

==Ancestry==
== Poetry and the Bannatyne Manuscript ==
Darnley was the author of &#x27;Darnley&#x27;s Ballet&#x27;, &#x27;Gife langour makis men licht&#x27;, and potentially &#x27;Quhair luve is kendlit confortless&#x27; [attribution uncertain] printed in the Bannatyne Manuscript (1570 ca.).

<doc id="70209" wikidata="Q2973146" url="?curid=70209" title="Cinema of Australia">
<text>The cinema of Australia began with the 1906 production of &quot;The Story of the Kelly Gang&quot;, arguably the world&#x27;s first feature film. Since then, Australian crews have produced many films, a number of which have received international recognition. Many actors and filmmakers with international reputations started their careers in Australian films, and many of these have established lucrative careers in larger film-producing centres such as the United States.

Commercially successful Australian films include &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;, George Miller&#x27;s &quot;Mad Max&quot; trilogy, Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, and Chris Noonan&#x27;s &quot;Babe&quot;. Award-winning productions include &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot;, &quot;Gallipoli&quot;, &quot;The Tracker&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot; and &quot;Ten Canoes&quot;.

==History==
The Australian film critic David Stratton characterized the history of the country&#x27;s film as one of &quot;boom and bust&quot;: there have been deep troughs, during which few films were made for decades, and high peaks, during which a glut of films reached the market.

===Pioneer days – 1890s to 1910===
The first public screenings of films in Australia took place in October 1896, within a year of the world&#x27;s first screening in Paris by Lumière brothers. On 22 August 1896, the first films projected to a paying audience in Australia were at Harry Rickards&#x27; Melbourne Opera House (later known as the Tivoli Theatre). The film by magician Carl Hertz was screened as part of a variety show act. Australian tours with similar projection machines followed.
Australia&#x27;s first cinema, the &quot;Salon Lumière&quot; at 237 Pitt Street, Sydney, was operating in October 1896, and showed the first Australian-produced short film on 27 October 1896.

The Athenaeum Hall in Collins Street, Melbourne, operated as a dance hall from the 1880s, and from time to time would provide alternative entertainment to patrons. In October 1896 it exhibited the first movie film shown in Australia, within a year of the first public screening of a film in Paris on 28 December 1895 by the French Lumière brothers. The Athenaeum would continue screenings, such as &quot;Life in Our Navy&quot;, a 60,000 foot film of life on HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot;, shown on 26 January 1901 by G. H. Snazelle, who provided additional entertainment.

A landmark of newsreel photography was in 1897, when films of both the Caulfield Cup and Melbourne Cup were screened at the Melbourne Opera House on the evenings of the race. The events had been captured on film for W. C. Baxter and developed the same day by photographer Robert William Harvie (died 5 October 1922) and inventor Ernest J. Thwaites (c. 1873 – 12 July 1933).

Some of the earliest movie film shot in Australia consisted of films of Aboriginal dancers in Central Australia, shot by anthropologists Baldwin Spencer and F. J. Gillen between 1900 and 1903. They pioneered sound recording on wax cylinders and shot their films under very difficult conditions.

The earliest feature-length narrative film in the world was the Australian-produced &quot;The Story of the Kelly Gang&quot; (1906), shown at the Athenaeum. The film, written and directed by Charles Tait, included several of his family members. The film was also exhibited in the United Kingdom in January 1908.

Melbourne also hosted one of the world&#x27;s first film studios, the Limelight Department, operated by the Salvation Army in Australia between 1897 and 1910. The Limelight Department produced evangelical material for use by the Salvation Army, as well as carrying out private and government contracts. In its 19 years of operation the Limelight Department produced about 300 films of various lengths, making it the largest film-producer of its time. The major innovation of the Limelight Department came in 1899 when Herbert Booth and Joseph Perry began work on &quot;Soldiers of the Cross&quot;, described by some as the first feature-length film ever produced. &quot;Soldiers of the Cross&quot; fortified the Limelight Department as a major player in the early film-industry. The Limelight Department also produced a film recording of the Federation of Australia.

===Boom and bust – 1910s to 1920s===
The 1910s were a &quot;boom&quot; period in Australian cinema. Activity had begun slowly in the 1900s, and 1910 saw four narrative films released, then 51 in 1911, 30 in 1912, and 17 in 1913, and back to four in 1914, when the beginning of World War I brought a temporary pause in film-making. While these numbers may seem small in the 21st century, Australia was one of the most prolific film-producing countries at the time. In all, between 1906 and 1928 Australia made 150 narrative feature films, almost 90 of them between 1910 and 1912.

A general consolidation took place in the early 1910s in the production, distribution and exhibition of films in Australia. By 1912 numerous independent producers had merged into Australasian Films and Union Theaters (now known as Event Cinemas), which established control over film distributors and cinemas and required smaller producers to deal with the cartel. Some view the arrangement as opening the way for American distributors in the 1920s to sign exclusive deals with Australian cinemas to exhibit only their own products, thereby shutting out the local product and crippling the local film-industry.

Various other explanations attempt to account for the decline of the industry in the 1920s. Some historians point to falling audience numbers, a lack of interest in Australian product and narratives, and Australia&#x27;s participation in the war. Also, an official ban on bushranger films occurred in 1912. With the suspension of local film-production, Australian cinema-chains sought alternative products in the United States and realised that Australian-produced films were much more expensive than the imported product, which were priced cheaply as production expenses had already been recouped in the home market. To redress this imbalance, the federal government of Australia imposed a tax on imported film in 1914, but this was removed by 1918.

Whatever the explanation, by 1923 American films dominated the Australian market, with 94% of all exhibited films coming from the United States.

===1930s–1960s===
In 1930, F. W. Thring (1883–1936) established the Efftee Studios based in Melbourne to make talking films using optical sound equipment imported from the United States. The first Australian sound films appeared in 1931: the company produced &quot;Diggers&quot; (1931), &quot;A Co-respondent&#x27;s Course&quot; (1931), &quot;The Haunted Barn&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Sentimental Bloke&quot; (1932). During the five years of its existence, Efftee produced nine features, over 80 shorts and several stage-productions. Notable collaborators included C. J. Dennis, George Wallace and Frank Harvey. Film production continued only until 1934, when it ceased as a protest over the refusal of the Australian government to set Australian film-quotas, followed soon by Thring&#x27;s death in 1936. It was estimated that Thring lost over £75,000 of his own money on his filmmaking and theatrical ventures.

Ken G. Hall became a driving force in establishing Cinesound Productions in 1931. The company became one of Australia&#x27;s first feature-film production companies and operated into the early 1940s, becoming Australia&#x27;s leading domestic studio based on the Hollywood model. The company also used the Hollywood model for the promotion of its films and attempted to promote a star system. It was particularly successful with the &quot;On Our Selection&quot; (1932) series of comedies, based on the popular writings of author Steele Rudd, which featured the adventures of a fictional Australian farming family, the Rudds, and the perennial father-and-son duo, &quot;Dad and Dave&quot;. Despite its ambitions, Cinesound produced only 17 feature-films, all but one of them directed by Ken Hall. Though financially successful, the company ceased making feature films following the 1939 outbreak of World War II.
&quot;In the Wake of the Bounty&quot; (1933), directed by Charles Chauvel, starred Tasmanian-born Errol Flynn. The film was not a success. Flynn then travelled to Britain to pursue a career in acting and later went to America and became a celebrated Hollywood star. Chauvel directed a number of successful Australian films, including 1944&#x27;s World War II classic &quot;The Rats of Tobruk&quot; (which starred Peter Finch and Chips Rafferty) and 1955&#x27;s &quot;Jedda&quot;, which was notable as the first Australian film shot in colour, and as the first to feature Aboriginal actors in lead roles and to enter the Cannes Film Festival.

In Britain, the Cinematograph Films Act 1927 established a quota of films that had to be shown in British cinemas. One could shoot compliant films in the British Empire as well as in Great Britain; this stimulated Australian film-production. However the Cinematograph Films Act 1938 mollified the British film industry by including only films made by and shot in Great Britain in the quota - this removed Australian films from the film quota in the UK, and saw the loss of a guaranteed market for Australian films.

&quot;Kokoda Front Line!&quot; (1942), directed by Ken G. Hall, won Australia&#x27;s first Oscar. Chips Rafferty and Peter Finch became prominent international stars of the period. Rafferty&#x27;s onscreen image as a lanky, laconic bushman struck a chord with Australian filmgoers, and he appeared in iconic early Australian films such as &quot;Forty Thousand Horsemen&quot; (1940), &quot;The Rats of Tobruk&quot; (1944), &quot;The Overlanders&quot; (1946) and &quot;Eureka Stockade&quot; (1949) (&quot;Overlanders&quot; and &quot;Eureka&quot; were part of a series of Australian-themed films produced by Britain&#x27;s iconic Ealing Studios). In Hollywood, Rafferty also appeared in Australian-themed films, including &quot;The Desert Rats&quot; (1953), &quot;The Sundowners&quot; (1960) and &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962). Similarly, Peter Finch starred in quintessentially Australian roles (such as &quot;digger&quot; and stockman) through a series of popular films and had a successful and diverse screen career in Britain and the United States.

Both Ron Randell and Rod Taylor began their acting careers in Australia - initially in radio and on stage before appearing in such Australian films as &quot;Smithy&quot; (1946) for the former and &quot;Long John Silver&quot; (1954) for the latter. They each transferred to the United States to become Hollywood leading men in a number of films of the late 1940s (Randell) and both from the 1950s onwards. Taylor had starring roles in &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963) as well as in several American television-series such as &quot;Hong Kong&quot; (1960-1961).

In the 1950s British and American production-companies made several notable films in Australia based on stories from Australian literature (generally with strong rural themes). These included &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot; (1956, which starred Virginia McKenna and Peter Finch); &quot;The Shiralee&quot; (1957, also starring Peter Finch with Australian actors Charles Tingwell, Bill Kerr and Ed Devereaux in supporting roles); &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot; (1957, again starring Finch); and &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot; (1959, starring Ernest Borgnine, John Mills and Angela Lansbury). In 1960, &quot;The Sundowners&quot; was shot partly in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales with foreign leads Deborah Kerr, Robert Mitchum, and Peter Ustinov but a supporting cast including Australians - Chips Rafferty, John Meillon and Leonard Teale.

In 1958, Australian Film Institute was formed and in the same year began awarding the Australian Film Institute Awards.

After filming &quot;Whiplash&quot; in the country in 1960, Peter Graves said that the biggest problem was the shortage of Australian actors. Australian film-production reached a low ebb with few notable productions during the 1960s. The 1966 comedy &quot;They&#x27;re a Weird Mob&quot;, starring Walter Chiari, Chips Rafferty and Claire Dunne, was a rare hit of the period which also documented something of the changing face of Australian society: telling the story of a newly-arrived Italian immigrant who, working as a labourer in Sydney, becomes mates with his co-workers, despite some difficulties with Australian slang and culture. The film foreshadowed the successful approaching &quot;New Wave&quot; of Australian cinema of the 1970s that would often showcase colloquial Australian culture.

Overseas cinema continued to attract Australian actors as &quot;action-men&quot; with the casting of Australian George Lazenby to replace Sean Connery in portraying the superspy James Bond in the 1969 U.K. film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;.

===Renaissance – 1970s and 1980s===

John Gorton, Prime Minister of Australia from 1968 to 1971, initiated several forms of government support for film and the arts, including the Australian Film Development Corporation. The Gough Whitlam government (1972–75) continued the support via its successor the Australian Film Commission, and state governments also established assistance programs. These measures led to a resurgence of Australian film-making in both the low budget 16mm format and 35mm cinema - the Australian New Wave - which lasted until the mid-to-late 1980s. The era also marked the emergence of the &quot;Ozploitation&quot; style – characterised by the exploitation of colloquial Australian culture.
Also notable during this era was the effect of the growing feminist movement. The role of women&#x27;s films was discussed at the Women&#x27;s Liberation Conference in Melbourne in 1970, and groups such as the Feminist Film Workers collective (1970s and 1980s), Sydney Women&quot;s Film Group (SWFG, 1972–), Melbourne Women&#x27;s Film Group (1973–), Reel Women (1979 to 1983 in Melbourne), and Women&#x27;s Film Unit (Sydney and Melbourne, 1984/5) were established. A number of filmmakers, including Jeni Thornley, Sarah Gibson, Susan Lambert, Martha Ansara, Margot Nash and Megan McMurchy, were involved in these groups. The 1975 International Women&#x27;s Film Festival, the first of its kind, was initiated by the SWFG, but groups around the country organised screening events in other state capitals. In Melbourne and Sydney the festivals ran for nine days (with an audience of around 56,000), and in the other states they spanned two to three days.

Films such as &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; (directed by Peter Weir, 1975) and &quot;Sunday Too Far Away&quot; (Ken Hannam, 1975) made an impact on the international scene. The 1970s and 1980s are regarded by many as a &quot;golden age&quot; of Australian cinema, with many successful films, from the dark dystopian fiction of &quot;Mad Max&quot; (George Miller, 1979) to the romantic comedy of &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; (Peter Faiman, 1986) and the emergence of such film-directing auteurs as Gillian Armstrong, Phillip Noyce and Bruce Beresford.

A major theme of Australian cinema which matured in the 1970s was one of survival in the harsh Australian landscape. A number of thrillers and horror-films - dubbed &quot;outback gothic&quot; - have appeared, including &quot;Wake in Fright&quot;, &quot;Walkabout&quot;, &quot;The Cars That Ate Paris&quot; and &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; in the 1970s, &quot;Razorback&quot;, &quot;Long Weekend&quot; and &quot;Shame&quot; in the 1980s and &quot;Japanese Story&quot;, &quot;The Proposition&quot; and &quot;Wolf Creek&quot; in the 2000s. These films depict the Australian bush and its creatures as deadly, and its people as outcasts and psychopaths. These elements combine with futuristic post-apocalyptic themes in the &quot;Mad Max&quot; series. 1971&#x27;s &quot;Walkabout&quot; was a British film, set in Australia, which became a forerunner to many Australian films related to indigenous themes; it introduced David Gulpilil to cinematic audiences. 1976&#x27;s &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot; directed by Fred Schepisi re-told an award-winning historical drama from the book by Thomas Keneally about the tragic story of an Aboriginal bushranger.

Classic stories from Australian literature and Australian history continued to provide popular cinematic adaptations during the 1970s and 1980s. Gillian Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; (1979) featured Judy Davis and Sam Neill in early lead-roles. 1982&#x27;s &quot;We of the Never Never&quot; followed up on the theme of the female experience of life in the Australian bush. 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;, starring Tom Burlinson and Sigrid Thornton, dramatised the classic Banjo Paterson poem of that name and became one of the all-time box-office successes of Australian cinema. In addition to the serious historical dramas popular in the 1970s, a number of films celebrating and satirizing Australian colloquial culture appeared over the decade, including: &quot;The Adventures of Barry McKenzie&quot; (1972), &quot;Alvin Purple&quot; (1973), and &quot;Barry McKenzie Holds His Own&quot; (1974). The Barry McKenzie films saw performing-artist and writer Barry Humphries collaborating with director Bruce Beresford. In 1976, Peter Finch won a posthumous Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the American satire &quot;Network&quot;, thus becoming the first Australian to win an Oscar for best actor.

1980&#x27;s &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; (starring Jack Thompson and Edward Woodward) dramatised the controversial trial of an Australian soldier during the Boer War of 1899-1902; there followed 1981&#x27;s World War I drama &quot;Gallipoli&quot; (directed by Peter Weir and starring Mel Gibson). These films, now considered classics of Australian cinema, explored contemporary Australian identity through dramatic episodes in Australian history. Gibson went on to further success in 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; before transferring to pursue his Hollywood career as an actor and director. Many other Australian stars would follow his path to international stardom in the coming decades. The director of &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot;, Peter Weir, also made a successful transition to Hollywood. Weir contributed to the screenplay along with its original author, Christopher Koch, and playwright David Williamson. Williamson rose to prominence in the early 1970s, and has gone on to write several other original scripts and screenplays made into successful Australian films, including: &quot;Don&#x27;s Party&quot; (1976); &quot;Gallipoli&quot; (1981), &quot;Emerald City&quot; (1988), and &quot;Balibo&quot; (2009).

Actor/comedian Paul Hogan wrote the screenplay and starred in the title role in his first film, &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; (1986), about a down-to-earth hunter who travels from the Australian outback to New York City. The movie became the most successful Australian film ever, and launched Hogan&#x27;s international film career. Following the success of &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;, Hogan starred in the sequel, &quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot; in 1988. 1988 also saw the release of the drama &quot;Evil Angels&quot; (released outside of Australia and New Zealand as &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot;) about the Lindy Chamberlain saga, in which a dingo took a baby at Ayers Rock and her mother was accused of having murdered the child.

Nicole Kidman began appearing in Australian children&#x27;s TV and film in the early 1980s – including starring roles in &quot;BMX Bandits&quot; and &quot;Bush Christmas&quot;. During the 1980s she appeared in several Australian productions, including &quot;Emerald City&quot; (1988), and &quot;Bangkok Hilton&quot; (1989). In 1989 Kidman starred in &quot;Dead Calm&quot; alongside Sam Neill and Billy Zane. The thriller garnered strong reviews, and Hollywood roles followed.

===1990–2000===
The 1990s proved a successful decade for Australian film and introduced several new stars to a global audience. Low budget films such as the comedy/drama &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, starring Toni Collette, the gently satirical suburban comedy &quot;The Castle&quot; directed by Rob Sitch (which cast Eric Bana in his first prominent film role), and Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s flamboyant &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; each attained commercial and critical success, and explored quirky characters inhabiting contemporary Australian suburbia – marking something of a departure from the Outback and historical sagas which obtained success in the 1970s and 1980s. Stephan Elliott&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; mixed traditional outback cinematography and landscape with contemporary urban sub-culture: following three drag queens on a road trip to Central Australia.

While a number of major international stars gained early prominence in Australia over the period, an important stable of established and emerging local stars with prodigious film credits remained prominent, including screen veterans Charles Tingwell, Bill Hunter, Jack Thompson, Bryan Brown and Chris Haywood.

The World War II drama &quot;Blood Oath&quot; (1990) debuted both Russell Crowe and Jason Donovan, in minor cinematic roles. Crowe demonstrated his versatility as an actor in this early period of his career by starring soon after as a street gang Melbourne skinhead in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Romper Stomper&quot; and then as an inner-Sydney working-class gay man in 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Sum of Us&quot; before transferring to the US to commence his Hollywood career.

George Miller&#x27;s &quot;Babe&quot; (1995) employed new digital effects to make a barnyard come alive and went on to become one of Australia&#x27;s highest-grossing films. The 1996 drama &quot;Shine&quot; achieved an Academy Award for Best Actor award for Geoffrey Rush and Gregor Jordan&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Two Hands&quot; gave Heath Ledger his first leading role.

===2001–2019===
After Ledger&#x27;s successful transition to Hollywood, Jordan and Ledger collaborated again in 2003, with Ledger playing the iconic bushranger title role in the film &quot;Ned Kelly&quot;, co-starring Australian actress Naomi Watts.

The canon of films related to Indigenous Australians also increased over the period of the 1990s and early 21st Century, with Nick Parsons&#x27; 1996 film &quot;Dead Heart&quot; featuring Ernie Dingo and Bryan Brown; Rolf de Heer&#x27;s &quot;The Tracker&quot;, starring Gary Sweet and David Gulpilil; and Phillip Noyce&#x27;s &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; in 2002. In 2006, Rolf de Heer&#x27;s &quot;Ten Canoes&quot; became the first major feature film to be shot in an Indigenous language and the film was recognised at Cannes and elsewhere.

The shifting demographics of Australia following post-war multicultural immigration was reflected in Australian cinema through the period and in successful films like 1993&#x27;s &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;; 1999&#x27;s &quot;Looking for Alibrandi&quot;; 2003&#x27;s &quot;Fat Pizza&quot;; the &quot;Wog Boy&quot; comedies and 2007&#x27;s &quot;Romulus, My Father&quot; which all dealt with aspects of the migrant experience or Australian subcultures.

Fox Studios Australia and Warner Roadshow Studios had hosted large international productions like George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; and Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, and the &quot;Wachowskis&#x27;s The Matrix.&quot;

Rob Sitch and Working Dog Productions followed the success of &quot;The Castle&quot; with period comedy &quot;The Dish&quot;, which was the highest grossing Australian film of the Year 2000 and entered the top ten list of highest grossing Australian films. Big budget Australian-international co-productions &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (Baz Luhrmann, 2001) and &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature for filmmaker George Miller in 2006) also entered the top ten list during the first decade of the new century. Baz Luhrmann directed a series of international hits and returned to Australia for the production of 2008&#x27;s &quot;Australia&quot;, which showcased a host of Australian stars including Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman and David Wenham and went on to become the second highest-grossing film in Australian cinematic history.

&quot;Lantana&quot;, directed by Ray Lawrence attained critical and commercial success in 2001 for its examination of a complex series of relationships in suburban Sydney, and events surrounding a mysterious crime. It won seven AFI Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Anthony LaPaglia and Best Actress for Kerry Armstrong.

Emerging star Sam Worthington had early lead roles in the 2002 mobster black comedy &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot; and 2003&#x27;s crime caper &quot;Gettin&#x27; Square&quot;. &quot;Gettin Square&quot; also featured rising star David Wenham who demonstrated versatility with a string of critically acclaimed roles including the title role in Paul Cox&#x27;s 1999 biopic &quot;&quot; and the 2001 thriller &quot;The Bank&quot;, directed by the politically conscious film director Robert Connolly.

In 2005, &quot;Little Fish&quot; marked a return to Australian film for actress Cate Blanchett and won five Australian Film Institute Awards including Best Actor for Hugo Weaving, Best Actress for Blanchett and Best Supporting Actress for screen veteran Noni Hazlehurst.

In 2008 following Ledger&#x27;s death, the documentary film celebrating the romps of the Australian New Wave of 1970s and 1980s low-budget cinema: &quot;Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation!&quot; The film was directed by Mark Hartley and interviews filmmakers including Quentin Tarantino, Dennis Hopper, George Miller and Barry Humphries.

The early 2000s were generally not successful years for Australian cinema, with several confronting dramas proving unpopular at the box office. In 2008, no Australian movies made $3 million at the box office, but a conscious decision by filmmakers to broaden the types of films being made as well as the range of budgets produced a series of box-office hits at the close of the decade. Strong box office performances were recorded in 2009–10 by Bruce Beresford&#x27;s &quot;Mao&#x27;s Last Dancer&quot;; the Aboriginal musical &quot;Bran Nue Dae&quot; the dramatization of John Marsden&#x27;s novel &quot;Tomorrow, When the War Began&quot;; and the crime drama &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot; which featured major Australian screen stars Ben Mendelsohn, Joel Edgerton, Guy Pearce and Jacki Weaver. &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot; achieved success at the 2010 Australian Film Institute Awards and was acclaimed at film festivals around the world. &quot;Tomorrow, When the War Began&quot; became the highest-grossing domestic film of 2010 and it was nominated for nine Australian Film Institute Awards.

Other award-winning films of the period included &quot;Balibo&quot; (2009) starring Anthony LaPaglia; Middle Eastern crime flick &quot;Cedar Boys&quot; (2009) directed by Serhat Caradee; and animated comedy drama &quot;Mary and Max&quot;.
World War I drama &quot;Beneath Hill 60&quot; (2010), directed by Jeremy Sims and starring Brendan Cowell, was nominated for numerous awards and won three.

Sally Riley, as inaugural head of the Indigenous department at ABC Television, after her previous role at the Australian Film Commission (later Screen Australia), has done much to develop Indigenous talent in the film and television industry. Contemporary Indigenous film-makers include Warwick Thornton, Wayne Blair, Trisha Morton-Thomas and Rachel Perkins.

The Australian film industry continues to produce a reasonable number of films each year, but in common with other English-speaking countries, Australia has often found it difficult to compete with the American film industry, the latter helped by having a much larger home market. The most successful Australian actors and filmmakers are easily lured by Hollywood and rarely return to the domestic film industry. The South Australian Film Corporation continues to produce quality films, and Adelaide has been chosen as the location for films such as &quot;Hotel Mumbai&quot; (2019).

===2020–present===
The Australian film and TV industry was greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with at least 60 shoots being halted and around 20,000 people being put of work. On Monday 23 March, all productions funded by Screen Australia were postponed. , after some improvement in COVID-19 statistics in Australia, Screen Australia continues to fund work and process applications, intending to use all of its 2019/20 budget.

Sometime after the movie and TV industries reopened, several films restarted production. Two such films were &quot;Escape from Pretoria&quot; (2020) and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2021).

==Genres==
=== Australian Gothic films ===
Gothic films incorporate Gothic elements and can be infused within different genres such as horror, romance, science fiction, and comedy. Australian Gothic films have been an accordant genera ever since the 1970s. Gothic Australian films means to make films that are diverse and use camera techniques in different ways to question what the audience may perceive. One of the Australian Gothic films created by female filmmakers Suzan Dermody and Elizabeth Jacka called &quot;The Screening of Australia&quot; (1987), shows different stylistic thematic terms and was the most successful at showing what is called the ocker, a term to describe a (white) Australian savage man. Other than this, there is a strong relationship between Australian Gothic films and Gothic literature. The characters and the actions that happen in a Gothic novel is created into a Gothic film. Most Gothic novels during the 1970s referred to female characters and their Australian cultural values.

Although the film &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; (1975) was directed by a male filmmaker, it was written by storyteller Joan Lindsay. Lindsay decided to make this film culturally related to Australian societal issues of day-to-day lives. Her film included Gothic materials and gave a twist of horror that later the director will showcase through the mise-en-scene and cinematography. The use of Gothic materials were offered by the filmmakers Dermody and Jacka to other Australian Gothic films that have opened up to a more thematic analysis. Other Gothic films were made to broaden Australian characteristics and features. &quot;Smoke Em If You Got ‘Em&quot; (1988), produced by Jennifer Hooks, showcased the protagonist in a supernatural horrific way, but also added a comedic twist to not lose its characterization of film style.

==Film schools==
There are several film schools in Australia, most notably the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, known as AFTRS in Sydney. Others include Griffith Film School in Brisbane; the WA Screen and Media Academy at Edith Cowan University in Perth; and Media Arts and Production, University of Technology Sydney (MAP UTS). All are full members of CILECT, the international association of film schools.

In Melbourne, Victoria, Swinburne Film and Television School (1966–1991) produced many notable filmmakers, before merging into Victorian College of the Arts, becoming VCA Film and Television School (later merged into the University of Melbourne). However Swinburne University&#x27;s Swinburne School of Film and Television (SSFT) remains, and both the VCA and SSFT are full members of CILECT. RMIT University runs various degree and diploma courses relating to filmmaking. In addition, in collaboration with AFTRS, it started delivering four short intensive courses relating to filmmaking and the film industry from December 2024.

In South Australia, Flinders University introduced their Bachelor of Creative Arts Screen (BCA) in 2002, which proved both popular and successful.

==Government support==

John Gorton, Prime Minister of Australia from 1968–1971, initiated several forms of Government support for Australian film and the arts, establishing the Australian Council for the Arts, the Australian Film Development Corporation and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. Prime Minister Gough Whitlam continued to support Australian film. The South Australian Film Corporation was established in 1972 to promote and produce films, while the Australian Film Commission was created in 1975 to fund and produce internationally competitive films.

The federal Australian government had supported the Australian film industry through the funding and development agencies of Film Finance Corporation Australia, the Australian Film Commission and Film Australia. In 2008 the three agencies were consolidated into Screen Australia.

===Government funding bodies===
* Screen Australia (successor to Australian Film Commission, Film Australia, and Film Finance Corporation Australia)
* Queensland Film Corporation (defunct)
* Screen NSW
* Screenwest
* South Australian Film Corporation
* Tasmanian Film Corporation (defunct)

<doc id="70210" wikidata="Q42470" url="?curid=70210" title="Motto">
<text>A motto (derived from the Latin , &#x27;mutter&#x27;, by way of Italian , &#x27;word&#x27; or &#x27;sentence&#x27;) is a sentence or phrase expressing a belief or purpose, or the general motivation or intention of an individual, family, social group, or organization. Mottos (or mottoes) are usually found predominantly in written form (unlike slogans, which may also be expressed orally), and may stem from long traditions of social foundations, or from significant events, such as a civil war or a revolution. One&#x27;s motto may be in any language, but Latin has been widely used, especially in the Western world.

==Language==
Latin has been very common for mottos in the Western World, but for nation states, their official national language is generally chosen. Examples of using other historical languages in motto language include:
*County of Somerset in England: (All the men of Somerset), Old English.
*South Cambridgeshire in the English Fens: (Nothing without work), Dutch, originally the motto of Dutchman Cornelius Vermuyden, who drained The Fens in the 17th century.
*South Africa: &quot;ǃke e: ǀxarra ǁke&quot; (Unity in diversity), ǀXam.
*Shire of Shetland: &quot;Með lögum skal land byggja&quot; (By law shall the land be built up), Old Norse.

A canting motto is one that contains word play. For example, the motto of the Earl of Onslow is &quot;Festina lente&quot; (literally &#x27;make haste slowly&#x27;), punningly interpreting &#x27;on slow&#x27;. Similarly, the motto of the Burgh of Tayport, &quot;Te oportet alte ferri&quot; (It is incumbent on you to carry yourself high), is a cant on &#x27;Tayport at auld Tay Ferry&#x27;, also alluding to the local lighthouse. The motto of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, &quot;Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity&quot;, is a backronym of the letters F.B.I.

==List of examples==

*&quot;United in diversity&quot;, the motto of the European Union (EU)
*&quot;In God We Trust&quot;, the motto of the United States (US)
*&quot;Je Maintiendrai Châlons (French for &quot;I will maintain Châlons&quot;), often abbreviated as Je maintiendrai&quot; (French for &quot;I will maintain&quot;), the motto of the Netherlands
*&quot;Dieu et mon droit&quot; (French for &quot;God and my right&quot;), is the motto of the monarch of the United Kingdom. It appears on a scroll beneath the shield of the version of the coat of arms of the United Kingdom.
*&quot;Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno&quot; (Latin for &quot;One for all, all for one&quot;), unofficial motto of Switzerland
*&quot;Post tenebras lux&quot; (Latin for &quot;Light After Darkness&quot;), motto of University of Geneva
*&quot;United we stand, divided we fall&quot;

==Mottos in heraldry==

In heraldry, a motto is often found &quot;below&quot; the shield in a banderole in the compartment. This placement stems from the Middle Ages, in which the vast majority of nobles possessed a coat of arms complete with a motto. In the case of Scottish heraldry, it is mandated to appear &quot;above&quot; the crest and is called slogan (see: Slogan (heraldry)). The word &#x27;slogan&#x27; is an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic &quot;sluagh-ghairm&quot; (&quot;sluagh&quot; &quot;army, host&quot; + &quot;gairm&quot; &quot;cry&quot;). There are several notable slogans which are thought to originate from a battle or war cries. In heraldic literature, the terms &#x27;rallying cry&#x27; respectively &#x27;battle banner&#x27; are also common. Spanish coats of arms may display a motto in the bordure of the shield.

In English heraldry, mottos are not granted with armorial bearings, and may be adopted and changed at will. In Scottish heraldry, mottos can only be changed by re-matriculation, with the Lord Lyon King of Arms. Although unusual in England, and perhaps outside English heraldic practice, there are some examples, such as in Belgium, of the particular appearance of the motto scroll and letters thereon being blazoned; a prominent example is the obverse of the Great Seal of the United States (which is a coat of arms and follows heraldic conventions), the blazon for which specifies that the motto scroll is held in the beak of the bald eagle serving as the escutcheon&#x27;s supporter.

Ships and submarines in the Royal Navy (RN) each have a badge and motto, as do units of the Royal Air Force (RAF).

==Mottos in literature==
In literature, a motto is a sentence, phrase, poem, or word; prefixed to an essay, chapter, novel, or the like, suggestive of its subject matter. It is a short, suggestive expression of a guiding principle for the written material that follows.

For example, Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes&quot; uses mottos at the start of each section.

<doc id="70219" wikidata="Q213061" url="?curid=70219" title="Charles I of Hungary">
<text>Charles I, also known as Charles Robert (; ; ; 128816 July 1342), was King of Hungary and Croatia from 1308 to his death. He was a member of the Capetian House of Anjou and the only son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno. His father was the eldest son of Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary. Mary laid claim to Hungary after her brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, died in 1290, but the Hungarian prelates and lords elected her cousin, Andrew III, king. Instead of abandoning her claim to Hungary, she transferred it to her son, Charles Martel, and after his death in 1295, to her grandson, Charles. On the other hand, her husband, Charles II of Naples, made their third son, Robert, heir to the Kingdom of Naples, thus disinheriting Charles.

Charles came to the Kingdom of Hungary upon the invitation of an influential Croatian lord, Paul Šubić, in August 1300. Andrew III died on 14 January 1301, and within four months Charles was crowned king, but with a provisional crown instead of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king. Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303, but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent. Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305. Because it had no central government, the Kingdom of Hungary had disintegrated into a dozen provinces, each headed by a powerful nobleman, or oligarch. One of those oligarchs, Ladislaus III Kán, captured and imprisoned Otto of Bavaria in 1307. Charles was elected king in Pest on 27 November 1308, but his rule remained nominal in most parts of his kingdom even after he was crowned with the Holy Crown on 27 August 1310.

Charles won his first decisive victory in the Battle of Rozgony (at present-day Rozhanovce in Slovakia) on 15 June 1312. After that, his troops seized most fortresses of the powerful Aba family. During the next decade, Charles restored royal power primarily with the assistance of the prelates and lesser noblemen in most regions of the kingdom. After the death of the most powerful oligarch, Matthew Csák, in 1321, Charles became the undisputed ruler of the whole kingdom, with the exception of Croatia where local noblemen were able to preserve their autonomous status. He was not able to hinder the development of Wallachia into an independent principality after his defeat in the Battle of Posada in 1330. Charles&#x27;s contemporaries described his defeat in that battle as a punishment from God for his cruel revenge against the family of Felician Záh who had attempted to slaughter the royal family.

Charles rarely made perpetual land grants, instead introduced a system of &quot;office fiefs&quot;, whereby his officials enjoyed significant revenues, but only for the time they held a royal office, which ensured their loyalty. In the second half of his reign, Charles did not hold Diets and administered his kingdom with absolute power. He established the Order of Saint George, which was the first secular order of knights. He promoted the opening of new gold mines, which made Hungary the largest producer of gold in Europe. The first Hungarian gold coins were minted during his reign. At the congress of Visegrád in 1335, he mediated a reconciliation between two neighboring monarchs, John of Bohemia and Casimir III of Poland. Treaties signed at the same congress also contributed to the development of new commercial routes linking Hungary with Western Europe. Charles&#x27;s efforts to reunite Hungary, together with his administrative and economic reforms, established the basis for the achievements of his successor, Louis the Great.

===Childhood (1288–1300)===

Charles was the only son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno, and his wife, Clemence of Austria. He was born in 1288; the place of his birth is unknown. Charles Martel was the firstborn son of Charles II of Naples and Charles II&#x27;s wife, Mary, who was a daughter of Stephen V of Hungary. After the death of her brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, in 1290, Queen Mary announced her claim to Hungary, stating that the House of Árpád (the royal family of Hungary) had become extinct with Ladislaus&#x27;s death. However, her father&#x27;s cousin, Andrew also laid claim to the throne, although his father, Stephen the Posthumous, had been regarded a bastard by all other members of the royal family. For all that, the Hungarian lords and prelates preferred Andrew against Mary and he was crowned king of Hungary on 23 July 1290. She transferred her claim to Hungary to Charles Martel in January 1292. The Babonići, Frankopans, Šubići and other Croatian and Slavonian noble families seemingly acknowledged Charles Martel&#x27;s claim, but in fact their loyalty vacillated between Charles Martel and Andrew III.

Charles Martel died in autumn 1295, and his seven-year-old son, Charles, inherited his claim to Hungary. Charles would have also been the lawful heir to his grandfather, Charles II of Naples, in accordance with the principles of primogeniture. However, Charles II, who preferred his third son, Robert, to his grandson, bestowed the rights of a firstborn son upon Robert on 13 February 1296. Pope Boniface VIII confirmed Charles II&#x27;s decision on 27 February 1296, excluding the child Charles from succeeding his grandfather in the Kingdom of Naples. Dante Alighieri wrote of &quot;the schemes and frauds that would attack&quot; Charles Martel&#x27;s family in reference to Robert&#x27;s alleged manoeuvres to acquire the right to inherit Naples. The 14th-century historian Giovanni Villani also noted that his contemporaries were of the opinion that Robert&#x27;s claim to Naples was weaker than his nephew&#x27;s. The jurist Baldus de Ubaldis refrained from setting out his position on the legitimacy of Robert&#x27;s rule.

=== Struggle for Hungary (1300–1308) ===

Andrew III of Hungary made his maternal uncle, Albertino Morosini, Duke of Slavonia, in July 1299, stirring up the Slavonian and Croatian noblemen to revolt. A powerful Croatian baron, Paul Šubić, sent his brother, George, to Italy in early 1300 to convince Charles II of Naples to send his grandson to Hungary to claim the throne in person. The king of Naples accepted the proposal and borrowed 1,300 ounces of gold from Florentine bankers to finance Charles&#x27;s journey. A Neapolitan knight of French origin, Philip Drugeth, accompanied the twelve-year-old Charles to Hungary. They landed at Split in Dalmatia in August 1300. From Split, Paul Šubić escorted him to Zagreb where Ugrin Csák swore loyalty to Charles. Charles&#x27;s opponent, Andrew III of Hungary, died on 14 January 1301. Charles hurried to Esztergom where the Archbishop-elect, Gregory Bicskei, crowned him with a provisional crown before 13 May. However, most Hungarians considered Charles&#x27;s coronation unlawful because customary law required that it should have been performed with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár.

Charles counted his regnal years from this coronation, but Hungary had actually disintegrated into about a dozen independent provinces, each ruled by a powerful lord, or oligarch. Among them, Matthew Csák dominated the northwestern parts of Hungary (which now form the western territories of present-day Slovakia), Amadeus Aba controlled the northeastern lands, Ivan Kőszegi ruled Transdanubia, and Ladislaus Kán governed Transylvania. Most of those lords refused to accept Charles&#x27;s rule and proposed the crown to Wenceslaus II of Bohemia&#x27;s son and namesake, Wenceslaus, whose bride, Elisabeth, was Andrew III&#x27;s only daughter. Although Wenceslaus was crowned with the Holy Crown in Székesfehérvár, the legitimacy of his coronation was also questionable because John Hont-Pázmány, Archbishop of Kalocsa, put the crown on Wenceslaus&#x27;s head, although customary law authorized the Archbishop of Esztergom to perform the ceremony.

After Wenceslaus&#x27;s coronation, Charles withdrew to Ugrin Csák&#x27;s domains in the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface sent his legate, Niccolo Boccasini, to Hungary. Boccasini convinced the majority of the Hungarian prelates to accept Charles&#x27;s reign. However, most Hungarian lords continued to oppose Charles because, according to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, they feared that &quot;the free men of the kingdom should lose their freedom by accepting a king appointed by the Church&quot;. Charles laid siege to Buda, the capital of the kingdom, in September 1302, but Ivan Kőszegi relieved the siege. Charles&#x27;s charters show that he primarily stayed in the southern parts of the kingdom during the next years although he also visited Amadeus Aba in the fortress of Gönc.

Pope Boniface who regarded Hungary as a fief of the Holy See declared Charles the lawful king of Hungary on 31 May 1303. He also threatened Wenceslaus with excommunication if he continued to style himself king of Hungary. Wenceslaus, left Hungary in summer 1304, taking the Holy Crown with him. Charles met his cousin, Rudolph III of Austria, in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) on 24 August. After signing an alliance, they jointly invaded Bohemia in the autumn. Wenceslaus who had succeeded his father in Bohemia renounced his claim to Hungary in favor of Otto III, Duke of Bavaria on 9 October 1305.

Otto was crowned with the Holy Crown in Székesfehérvár on 6 December 1305 by Benedict Rád, Bishop of Veszprém, and Anthony, Bishop of Csanád. He was never able to strengthen his position in Hungary, because only the Kőszegis and the Transylvanian Saxons supported him. Charles seized Esztergom and many fortresses in the northern parts of Hungary (now in Slovakia) in 1306. His partisans also occupied Buda in June 1307. Ladislaus Kán, Voivode of Transylvania, seized and imprisoned Otto in Transylvania. An assembly of Charles&#x27;s partisans confirmed Charles&#x27;s claim to the throne on 10 October, but three powerful lords—Matthew Csák, Ladislaus Kán, and Ivan Kőszegi—were absent from the meeting. In 1308, Ladislaus Kán released Otto, who then left Hungary. Otto never ceased styling himself King of Hungary, but he never returned to the country.

Pope Clement V sent a new papal legate, Gentile Portino da Montefiore, to Hungary. Montefiore arrived in the summer of 1308. In the next few months, he persuaded the most powerful lords one by one to accept Charles&#x27;s rule. At the Diet, which was held in the Dominican monastery in Pest, Charles was unanimously proclaimed king on 27 November 1308. The delegates sent by Matthew Csák and Ladislaus Kán were also present at the assembly.

==Reign==

=== Wars against the oligarchs (1308–1323) ===

The papal legate convoked the synod of the Hungarian prelates, who declared the monarch inviolable in December 1308. They also urged Ladislaus Kán to hand over the Holy Crown to Charles. After Kán refused to do so, the legate consecrated a new crown for Charles. Thomas II, Archbishop of Esztergom crowned Charles king with the new crown in the Church of Our Lady in Buda on 15 or 16 June 1309. However, most Hungarians regarded his second coronation invalid. The papal legate excommunicated Ladislaus Kán, who finally agreed to give the Holy Crown to Charles. On 27 August 1310, Archbishop Thomas of Esztergom put the Holy Crown on Charles&#x27;s head in Székesfehérvár; thus, Charles&#x27;s third coronation was performed in full accordance with customary law. However, his rule remained nominal in most parts of his kingdom.

Matthew Csák laid siege Buda in June 1311, and Ladislaus Kán declined to assist the king. Charles sent an army to invade Matthew Csák&#x27;s domains in September, but it achieved nothing. In the same year, Ugrin Csák died, enabling Charles to take possession of the deceased lord&#x27;s domains, which were situated between Požega in Slavonia and Temesvár (present-day Timișoara in Romania). The burghers of Kassa (now Košice in Slovakia) assassinated Amadeus Aba in September 1311. Charles&#x27;s envoys arbitrated an agreement between Aba&#x27;s sons and the town, which also prescribed that the Abas withdraw from two counties and allow the noblemen inhabiting their domains to freely join Charles. However, the Abas soon entered into an alliance with Matthew Csák against the king. The united forces of the Abas and Matthew Csák besieged Kassa, but Charles routed them in the Battle of Rozgony (now Rozhanovce in Slovakia) on 15 June 1312. Almost half of the noblemen who had served Amadeus Aba fought on Charles&#x27;s side in the battle. In July, Charles captured the Abas&#x27; many fortresses in Abaúj, Torna and Sáros counties, including Füzér, Regéc, and Munkács (now Mukacheve in Ukraine). Thereafter he waged war against Matthew Csák, capturing Nagyszombat (now Trnava in Slovakia) in 1313 and Visegrád in 1315, but was unable to win a decisive victory.

Charles transferred his residence from Buda to Temesvár in early 1315. Ladislaus Kán died in 1315, but his sons did not yield to Charles. Charles launched a campaign against the Kőszegis in Transdanubia and Slavonia in the first half of 1316. Local noblemen joined the royal troops, which contributed to the quick collapse of the Kőszegis&#x27; rule in southern parts of their domains. Meanwhile, James Borsa made an alliance against Charles with Ladislaus Kán&#x27;s sons and other lords, including Mojs Ákos and Peter, son of Petenye. They offered the crown to Andrew of Galicia. Charles&#x27;s troops, which were under the command of a former supporter of the Borsas, Dózsa Debreceni, defeated the rebels&#x27; united troops at Debrecen at the end of June. In the next two months, many fortresses of Borsa and his allies fell to the royal troops in Bihar, Szolnok, Borsod and Kolozs counties. No primary source has made reference to Charles&#x27;s bravery or heroic acts, suggesting that he rarely fought in person in the battles and sieges. However, he had excellent strategic skills: it was always Charles who appointed the fortresses to be besieged.

Stefan Dragutin, who controlled the Szerémség, Macsó and other regions along the southern borders of Hungary, died in 1316. Charles confirmed the right of Stefan Dragutin&#x27;s son, Vladislav, to succeed his father and declared Vladislav the lawful ruler of Serbia against Stefan Uroš II Milutin. However, Stefan Uroš II captured Vladislav and invaded the Szerémség. Charles launched a counter-campaign across the river Száva and seized the fortress of Macsó. In May 1317, Charles&#x27;s army suppressed the Abas&#x27; revolt, seizing Ungvár and Nevicke Castle (present-day Uzhhorod and Nevytsky Castle in Ukraine) from them. After that, Charles invaded Matthew Csák&#x27;s domains and captured Komárom (now Komárno in Slovakia) on 3 November 1317. After his uncle, King Robert of Naples, granted the Principality of Salerno and the domain of Monte Sant&#x27;Angelo to his brother (Charles&#x27;s younger uncle), John, Charles protested and laid claim to those domains, previously held by his father.

After Charles neglected to reclaim Church property that Matthew Csák had seized by force, the prelates of the realm made an alliance in early 1318 against all who would jeopardize their interests. Upon their demand, Charles held a Diet in summer, but refused to confirm the Golden Bull of 1222. Before the end of the year, the prelates made a complaint against Charles because he had taken possession of Church property. In 1319, Charles fell so seriously ill that the pope authorized Charles&#x27;s confessor to absolve him from his all sins before he died, but Charles recovered. In the same year, Dózsa Debreceni, whom Charles had made voivode of Transylvania, launched successful expeditions against Ladislaus Kán&#x27;s sons and their allies, and Charles&#x27;s future Judge royal, Alexander Köcski, seized the Kőszegis&#x27; six fortresses. In summer, Charles launched an expedition against Stefan Uroš II Milutin, during which he retook Belgrade and restored the Banate of Macsó. The last Diet during Charles&#x27;s reign was held in 1320; following that, he failed to convoke the yearly public judicial sessions, contravening the provisions of the Golden Bull.

Matthew Csák died on 18 March 1321. The royal army invaded the deceased lord&#x27;s province, which soon disintegrated because most of his former castellans yielded without resistance. Charles personally led the siege of Csák&#x27;s former seat, Trencsén (now Trenčín in Slovakia), which fell on 8 August. About three months later, Charles&#x27;s new voivode of Transylvania, Thomas Szécsényi, seized Csicsó (present-day Ciceu-Corabia in Romania), the last fortress of Ladislaus Kán&#x27;s sons.

In January 1322, two Dalmatian towns, Šibenik and Trogir, rebelled against Mladen II Šubić, who was a son of Charles&#x27;s one-time leading partisan, Paul Šubić. The two towns also accepted the suzerainty of the Republic of Venice although Charles had urged Venice not to intervene in the conflict between his subjects. Many Croatian lords (including his own brother, Paul II Šubić) also turned against Mladen, and their coalition defeated him at Klis. In September, Charles marched to Croatia where all the Croatian lords who were opposed to Mladen Šubić yielded to him in Knin. Mladen Šubić also visited Charles, but the king had the powerful lord imprisoned.

=== Consolidation and reforms (1323–1330) ===

As one of his charters concluded, Charles had taken &quot;full possession&quot; of his kingdom by 1323. In the first half of the year, he moved his capital from Temesvár to Visegrád in the centre of his kingdom. In the same year, the Dukes of Austria renounced Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia), which they had controlled for decades, in exchange for the support they had received from Charles against Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1322.

Royal power was only nominally restored in the lands between the Carpathian Mountains and the Lower Danube, which had been united under a voivode, known as Basarab, by the early 1320s. Although Basarab was willing to accept Charles&#x27;s suzerainty in a peace treaty signed in 1324, he refrained from renouncing control of the lands he had occupied in the Banate of Severin. Charles also attempted to reinstate royal authority in Croatia and Slavonia. He dismissed the Ban of Slavonia, John Babonić, replacing him with Mikcs Ákos in 1325. Ban Mikcs invaded Croatia to subjugate the local lords who had seized the former castles of Mladen Subić without the king&#x27;s approval, but one of the Croatian lords, Ivan I Nelipac, routed the ban&#x27;s troops in 1326. Consequently, royal power remained only nominal in Croatia during Charles&#x27;s reign. The Babonići and the Kőszegis rose up in open rebellion in 1327, but Ban Mikcs and Alexander Köcski defeated them. In retaliation, at least eight fortresses of the rebellious lords were confiscated in Slavonia and Transdanubia.

Through his victory over the oligarchs, Charles acquired about 60% of the Hungarian castles, along with the estates belonging to them. In 1323, he set about revising his previous land grants, which enabled him to reclaim former royal estates. During his reign, special commissions were set up to detect royal estates that had been unlawfully acquired by their owners. Charles refrained from making perpetual grants to his partisans. Instead, he applied a system of &quot;office fiefs&quot; (or &quot;honors&quot;), whereby his officials were entitled to enjoy all revenues accrued from their offices, but only for the time they held those offices. That system assured the preponderance of royal power, enabling Charles to rule &quot;with the plenitude of power&quot;, as he emphasized in one of his charters of 1335. He even ignored customary law: for instance, &quot;promoting a daughter to a son&quot;, which entitled her to inherit her father&#x27;s estates instead of her male cousins. Charles also took control of the administration of the Church in Hungary. He appointed the Hungarian prelates at will, without allowing the cathedral chapters to elect them.
He promoted the spread of chivalrous culture in his realms. He regularly held tournaments and introduced the new ranks of &quot;page of the royal court&quot; and &quot;knight of the royal court&quot;. Charles was the first monarch to create a secular order of knighthood by establishing the Order of Saint George in 1326. He was the first Hungarian king to grant helmet crests to his faithful followers to distinguish them from others &quot;by means of an &quot;insignium&quot; of their own&quot;, as he emphasized in one of his charters.

Charles reorganized and improved the administration of royal revenues. During his reign, five new &quot;chambers&quot; (administrative bodies headed by German, Italian or Hungarian merchants) were established for the control and collection of royal revenues from coinage, monopolies and custom duties. In 1327, he partially abolished the royal monopoly of gold mining, giving one third of the royal revenues from the gold extracted from a newly opened mine to the owner of the land where that mine was discovered. In the next few years, new gold mines were opened at Körmöcbánya (now Kremnica in Slovakia), Nagybánya (present-day Baia Mare in Romania) and Aranyosbánya (now Baia de Arieș in Romania). Hungarian mines yielded about of gold around 1330, which made up more than 30% of the world&#x27;s total production. The minting of gold coins began under Charles&#x27;s auspices in the lands north of the Alps in Europe. His florins, which were modelled on the gold coins of Florence, were first issued in 1326.
Internal peace and increasing royal revenues strengthened the international position of Hungary in the 1320s. On 13 February 1327, Charles and John of Bohemia signed an alliance in Nagyszombat (present-day Trnava in Slovakia) against the Habsburgs, who had occupied Pressburg. In the summer of 1328 Hungarian and Bohemian troops invaded Austria and routed the Austrian army on the banks of the Leitha River. On 21 September 1328, Charles signed a peace treaty with the three dukes of Austria (Frederick the Fair, Albert the Lame, and Otto the Merry), who renounced Pressburg and the Muraköz (now Međimurje in Croatia). The following year, Serbian troops laid siege to Belgrade, but Charles relieved the fortress.

Alliance with his father-in-law, Władysław I the Elbow-high, King of Poland, became a permanent element of Charles&#x27;s foreign policy in the 1320s. After being defeated by the united forces of the Teutonic Knights and John of Bohemia, Władysław I sent his son and heir, Casimir, to Visegrád in late 1329 to seek assistance from Charles. During his stay in Charles&#x27;s court, the nineteen-year-old Casimir seduced Clara Záh, who was a lady-in-waiting of Charles&#x27;s wife, Elisabeth of Poland, according to an Italian writer. On 17 April 1330, the young lady&#x27;s father, Felician Záh, stormed into the dining room of the royal palace at Visegrád with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family. Záh wounded both Charles and the queen on their right hand and attempted to kill their two sons, Louis and Andrew, before the royal guards killed him. Charles&#x27;s revenge was brutal: with the exception of Clara, Felician Záh&#x27;s children were tortured to death; Clara&#x27;s lips and all eight fingers were cut before she was dragged by a horse through the streets of many towns; all of Felician&#x27;s other relatives within the third degree of kinship (including his sons-in-law and sisters) were executed, and those within the seventh degree were condemned to perpetual serfdom.

=== Active foreign policy (1330–1339) ===

In September 1330, Charles launched a military expedition against Basarab I of Wallachia who had attempted to get rid of his suzerainty. After seizing the fortress of Severin (present-day Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania), he refused to make peace with Basarab and marched towards Curtea de Argeș, which was Basarab&#x27;s seat. The Wallachians applied scorched earth tactics, compelling Charles to make a truce with Basarab and withdraw his troops from Wallachia. While the royal troops were marching through a narrow pass across the Southern Carpathians on 9 November, the Wallachians ambushed them. During the next four days, the royal army was decimated; Charles could only escape from the battlefield after changing his clothes with one of his knights, Desiderius Hédervári, who sacrificed his life to enable the king&#x27;s escape. Charles did not attempt a new invasion of Wallachia, which subsequently developed into an independent principality.

In September 1331, Charles made an alliance with Otto the Merry, Duke of Austria, against Bohemia. He also sent reinforcements to Poland to fight against the Teutonic Knights and the Bohemians. In 1332 he signed a peace treaty with John of Bohemia and mediated a truce between Bohemia and Poland. In 1332 Charles allowed the collection of the papal tithe (the tenth part of the Church revenues) in his realms only after the Holy See agreed to give one third of the money collected to him. After years of negotiations, Charles visited his uncle, Robert, in Naples in July 1333. Two months later, Charles&#x27;s son, Andrew, was betrothed to Robert&#x27;s granddaughter, Joanna, who had been made her grandfather&#x27;s heir. Charles returned to Hungary in early 1334. In retaliation for a previous Serbian raid, he invaded Serbia and captured the fortress of Galambóc (now Golubac in Serbia).

In summer 1335, the delegates of John of Bohemia and the new King of Poland, Casimir III, entered into negotiations in Trencsén to put an end to the conflicts between the two countries. With Charles&#x27;s mediation, a compromise was reached on 24 August: John of Bohemia renounced his claim to Poland and Casimir of Poland acknowledged John of Bohemia&#x27;s suzerainty in Silesia. On 3 September, Charles signed an alliance with John of Bohemia in Visegrád, which was primarily formed against the Dukes of Austria. Upon Charles&#x27;s invitation, John of Bohemia and Casimir of Poland met in Visegrád in November. During the Congress of Visegrád, the two rulers confirmed the compromise that their delegates had worked out in Trencsén. Casimir III also promised to pay 400,000 groschen to John of Bohemia, but a part of this indemnification (120,000 groschen) was finally paid off by Charles instead of his brother-in-law. The three rulers agreed upon a mutual defence union against the Habsburgs, and a new commercial route was set up to enable merchants travelling between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire to bypass Vienna.
The Babonići and the Kőszegis made an alliance with the Dukes of Austria in January 1336. John of Bohemia, who claimed Carinthia from the Habsburgs, invaded Austria in February. Casimir III of Poland came to Austria to assist him in late June. Charles soon joined them at Marchegg. The dukes sought reconciliation and signed a peace treaty with John of Bohemia in July. Charles signed a truce with them on 13 December, and launched a new expedition against Austria early the next year. He forced the Babonići and the Kőszegis to yield, and the latter were also compelled to hand over to him their fortresses along the frontier in exchange for faraway castles. Charles&#x27;s peace treaty with Albert and Otto of Austria, which was signed on 11 September 1337, forbade both the dukes and Charles to give shelter to the other party&#x27;s rebellious subjects.

Charles continued the reform of coinage in the late 1330s. In 1336, he abolished the compulsory exchange of old coins for newly issued coins for villagers, but introduced a new tax, the chamber&#x27;s profit, to compensate the loss of royal revenues. Two years later, Charles ordered the minting of a new silver penny and prohibited payments made in foreign coins or silver bars.

John of Bohemia&#x27;s heir, Charles, Margrave of Moravia, visited Charles in Visegrád in early 1338. The margrave acknowledged the right of Charles&#x27;s son, Louis, to inherit Poland if Casimir III died without a son in exchange for Charles&#x27;s promise to persuade Casimir III not to invade Silesia. Two leading Polish lords, Zbigniew, chancellor of Cracow, and Spycimir Leliwita, also supported this plan and persuaded Casimir III, who lost his first wife on 26 May 1339, to start negotiations with Charles. In July, Casimir came to Hungary and designated his sister (Charles&#x27;s wife), Elizabeth, and her sons as his heirs. On his sons&#x27; behalf, Charles promised that they would make every effort to reconquer all lands that Poland had lost and that they would refrain from employing foreigners in Poland.
=== Last years (1339–1342) ===

Charles obliged the Kőszegis to renounce their last fortresses along the western borders of the kingdom in 1339 or 1340. He divided the large Zólyom County (now in Slovakia), which had been dominated by a powerful local lord, Donch, into three smaller counties in 1340. The following year, Charles also forced Donch to renounce his two fortresses in Zólyom in exchange for one castle in the distant Kraszna County (in present-day Romania). Around the same time, Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia, invaded Sirmium and captured Belgrade.

Charles was ailing during the last years of his life. He died in Visegrád on 16 July 1342. His corpse was first delivered to Buda where a Mass was said for his soul. From Buda, his corpse was taken to Székesfehérvár. He was buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica a month after his death. His brother-in-law, Casimir III of Poland, and Charles, Margrave of Moravia, were present at his funeral, an indication of Charles&#x27;s international prestige.

==Family==
The &quot;Anonymi descriptio Europae orientalis&quot; (&quot;An Anonymous&#x27; Description of Eastern Europe&quot;), written in the first half of 1308, claims that &quot;the daughter of the strapping Duke of Ruthenia, Leo, has recently married Charles, King of Hungary&quot;. Charles also stated in a charter of 1326 that he once travelled to &quot;Ruthenia&quot; (or Halych-Lodomeria) in order to bring his first wife back to Hungary. A charter issued on 23 June 1326 referred to Charles&#x27;s wife, Queen Mary. Historian Gyula Kristó says, the three documents show that Charles married a daughter of Leo II of Galicia in late 1305 or early 1306. Historian Enikő Csukovits accepts Kristó&#x27;s interpretation, but she writes that Mary of Galicia most probably died before the marriage. The Polish scholar, Stanisław Sroka, rejects Kristó&#x27;s interpretation, stating that Leo I—who was born in 1292, according to him—could hardly have fathered Charles&#x27;s first wife. In accordance with previous academic consensus, Sroka says that Charles&#x27;s first wife was Mary of Bytom from the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty.

The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; stated that Charles&#x27;s &quot;first consort, Maria ... was of the Polish nation&quot; and she was &quot;the daughter of Duke Casimir&quot;. Sroka proposes that Mary of Bytom married Charles in 1306, but Kristó writes that their marriage probably took place in the first half of 1311. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; recorded that she died on 15 December 1317, but a royal charter issued on 12 July 1318 stated that her husband made a land grant with her consent. Charles&#x27;s next—second or third—wife was Beatrice of Luxembourg, who was a daughter of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor, and the sister of John, King of Bohemia. Their marriage took place before the end of February 1319. She died in childbirth in early November in the same year. Charles&#x27;s last wife, Elisabeth, daughter of Władysław I, King of Poland, was born around 1306. Their marriage took place on 6 July 1320.

Most 14th-century Hungarian chroniclers write that Charles and Elisabeth of Poland had five sons. Their first son, Charles, was born in 1321 and died in the same year according to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;. However, a charter of June 1323 states that the child had died in this month. The second son of Charles and Elisabeth, Ladislaus, was born in 1324. The marriage of Ladislaus and Anne, a daughter of King John of Bohemia, was planned by their parents, but Ladislaus died in 1329. Charles&#x27;s and Elisabeth&#x27;s third son, Louis, who was born in 1326, survived his father and succeeded him as King of Hungary. His younger brothers, Andrew and Stephen, who were born in 1327 and 1332, respectively, also survived Charles.

Although no contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous sources made mention of any further children, Charles may have fathered two daughters, according to historians Zsuzsa Teke and Gyula Kristó. Zsuzsa Teke writes that they were born to Mary of Bytom, but the nearly contemporaneous Peter of Zittau wrote that she had died childless. Gyula Kristó proposes that a miniature in the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, which depicts Elisabeth of Poland and five children, implies that she gave birth to Charles&#x27;s two daughters, because Kristó identifies two of the three children standing on her right as daughters. The elder of Charles&#x27;s two possible daughters, Catherine, who was born in the early 1320s, was the wife of Henry II, Duke of Świdnica. Their only daughter, Anne, grew up in the Hungarian royal court after her parents&#x27; death, implying that Charles and Elisabeth of Poland were her grandparents. Historian Kazimierz Jasiński says that Elisabeth, the wife of Boleslaus II of Troppau, was also Charles&#x27;s daughter. If she was actually Charles&#x27;s daughter, she must have been born in about 1330, according to Kristó.

Charles also fathered an illegitimate son, Coloman, who was born in early 1317. His mother was a daughter of Gurke Csák. Coloman was elected Bishop of Győr in 1336.

== Legacy ==

Charles often declared that his principal aim was the &quot;restoration of the ancient good conditions&quot; of the kingdom.
On his coat-of-arms, he united the &quot;Árpád stripes&quot; with the motifs of the coat-of-arms of his paternal family, which emphasized his kinship with the first royal house of Hungary. During his reign, Charles reunited Hungary and introduced administrative and fiscal reforms. He bequeathed to his son, Louis the Great, a &quot;bulging exchequer and an effective system of taxation&quot;, according to scholar Bryan Cartledge. Nevertheless, Louis the Great&#x27;s achievements overshadowed Charles&#x27;s reputation.

The only contemporaneous record of Charles&#x27;s deeds were made by a Franciscan friar who was hostile towards the monarch. Instead of emphasizing Charles&#x27;s achievements in the reunification of the country, the friar described in detail the negative episodes of Charles&#x27;s reign. In particular, the unusual cruelty that the king showed after Felician Záh&#x27;s assassination attempt on the royal family contributed to the negative picture of Charles&#x27;s personality. The Franciscan friar attributed Charles&#x27;s defeat by Basarab of Wallachia as a punishment from God for the king&#x27;s revenge.

<text>The United States courts of appeals, or Federal Circuit Courts or U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals are the intermediate appellate courts of the United States federal judiciary. They hear appeals of cases from the United States district courts and some U.S. administrative agencies, and their decisions can be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. The courts of appeals are divided into 13 &quot;Circuits&quot;. Eleven of the circuits are numbered &quot;First&quot; through &quot;Eleventh&quot; and cover geographic areas of the United States and hear appeals from the U.S. district courts within their borders. The District of Columbia Circuit covers only Washington, DC. The Federal Circuit hears appeals from federal courts across the entire United States in cases involving certain specialized areas of law. 

The United States courts of appeals are considered the most powerful and influential courts in the United States after the Supreme Court. Because of their ability to set legal precedent in regions that cover millions of Americans, the United States courts of appeals have strong policy influence on U.S. law. Moreover, because the Supreme Court chooses to review fewer than 3% of the 7,000 to 8,000 cases filed with it annually, the U.S. courts of appeals serve as the final arbiter on most federal cases.

There are 179 judgeships on the U.S. courts of appeals authorized by Congress in pursuant to Article III of the U.S. Constitution. Like other federal judges, they are nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. They have lifetime tenure, earning (as of 2023) an annual salary of $246,600. The actual number of judges in service varies, both because of vacancies and because senior judges who continue to hear cases are not counted against the number of authorized judgeships.

Decisions of the U.S. courts of appeals have been published by the private company West Publishing in the &quot;Federal Reporter&quot; series since the courts were established. Only decisions that the courts designate for publication are included. The &quot;unpublished&quot; opinions (of all but the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits) are published separately in West&#x27;s &quot;Federal Appendix&quot;, and they are also available in on-line databases like LexisNexis or Westlaw. More recently, court decisions have also been made available electronically on official court websites. However, there are also a few federal court decisions that are classified for national security reasons.

The circuit with the fewest appellate judges is the First Circuit, and the one with the most appellate judges is the geographically large and populous Ninth Circuit in the West. The number of judges that the U.S. Congress has authorized for each circuit is set forth by law in , while the places where those judges must regularly sit to hear appeals are prescribed in .

Although the courts of appeals are frequently called &quot;circuit courts&quot;, they should not be confused with the former United States circuit courts, which were active from 1789 through 1911, during the time when long-distance transportation was much less available, and which were primarily first-level federal trial courts that moved periodically from place to place in &quot;circuits&quot; in order to serve the dispersed population in towns and the smaller cities that existed then. The &quot;courts of appeals&quot; system was established in the Judiciary Act of 1891.

==Procedure==
Because the courts of appeals possess only appellate jurisdiction, they do not hold trials. Only courts with original jurisdiction hold trials and thus determine punishments (in criminal cases) and remedies (in civil cases). Instead, appeals courts review decisions of trial courts for errors of law. Accordingly, an appeals court considers only the record (that is, the papers the parties filed and the transcripts and any exhibits from any trial) from the trial court, and the legal arguments of the parties. These arguments, which are presented in written form and can range in length from dozens to hundreds of pages, are known as briefs. Sometimes lawyers are permitted to add to their written briefs with oral arguments before the appeals judges. At such hearings, only the parties&#x27; lawyers speak to the court.

The rules that govern the procedure in the courts of appeals are the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. In a court of appeals, an appeal is almost always heard by a &quot;panel&quot; of three judges who are randomly selected from the available judges (including senior judges and judges temporarily assigned to the circuit). Some cases, however, receive an &quot;en banc&quot; hearing. Except in the Ninth Circuit Court, the &quot;en banc&quot; court consists of all of the circuit judges who are on active status, but it does not include the senior or assigned judges (except that under some circumstances, a senior judge may participate in an &quot;en banc&quot; hearing who participated at an earlier stage of the same case). Because of the large number of Appellate Judges in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (29), only ten judges, chosen at random, and the Chief Judge hear &quot;en banc&quot; cases.

Many decades ago, certain classes of federal court cases held the right of an automatic appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. That is, one of the parties in the case could appeal a decision of a court of appeals to the Supreme Court, and it had to accept the case. The right of automatic appeal for most types of decisions of a court of appeals was ended by an Act of Congress, the Judiciary Act of 1925, which also reorganized many other things in the federal court system. Passage of this law was urged by Chief Justice William Howard Taft.

The current procedure is that a party in a case may apply to the Supreme Court to review a ruling of the circuit court. This is called petitioning for a writ of certiorari, and the Supreme Court may choose, in its sole discretion, to review any lower court ruling. In extremely rare cases, the Supreme Court may grant the writ of certiorari before the judgment is rendered by the court of appeals, thereby reviewing the lower court&#x27;s ruling directly. Certiorari before judgment was granted in the Watergate scandal-related case, &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot;, and in the 2005 decision involving the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, &quot;United States v. Booker&quot;.

A court of appeals may also pose questions to the Supreme Court for a ruling in the midst of reviewing a case. This procedure was formerly used somewhat commonly, but now it is quite rare. For example, while between 1937 and 1946 twenty &#x27;certificate&#x27; cases were accepted, since 1947 the Supreme Court has accepted only four. The Second Circuit, sitting &quot;en banc&quot;, attempted to use this procedure in the case &quot;United States v. Penaranda&quot;, 375 F.3d 238 (2d Cir. 2004), as a result of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Blakely v. Washington&quot;, but the Supreme Court dismissed the question. The last instance of the Supreme Court accepting a set of questions and answering them was in 1982&#x27;s &quot;City of Mesquite v. Aladdin&#x27;s Castle, Inc&quot;.

A court of appeals may convene a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel to hear appeals in bankruptcy cases directly from the bankruptcy court of its circuit. , only the First, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have established a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel. Those circuits that do not have a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel have their bankruptcy appeals heard by the district court.

Courts of appeals decisions, unlike those of the lower federal courts, establish binding precedents. Other federal courts in that circuit must, from that point forward, follow the appeals court&#x27;s guidance in similar cases, regardless of whether the trial judge thinks that the case should be decided differently.

Federal and state laws can and do change from time to time, depending on the actions of Congress and the state legislatures. Therefore, the law that exists at the time of the appeal might be different from the law that existed at the time of the events that are in controversy under civil or criminal law in the case at hand. A court of appeals applies the law as it exists at the time of the appeal; otherwise, it would be handing down decisions that would be instantly obsolete, and this would be a waste of time and resources, since such decisions could not be cited as precedent. &quot;[A] court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice, or there is statutory direction or some legislative history to the contrary.&quot;

However, the above rule cannot apply in criminal cases if the effect of applying the newer law would be to create an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law to the detriment of the defendant.

Decisions made by the circuit courts only apply to the states within the court&#x27;s oversight, though other courts may use the guidance issued by the circuit court in their own judgments. While a single case can only be heard by one circuit court, a core legal principle may be tried through multiple cases in separate circuit courts, creating an inconsistency between different parts of the United States. This creates a split decision among the circuit courts. Often, if there is a split decision between two or more circuits, and a related case is petitioned to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court will take that case as to resolve the split.

==Attorneys==
In order to serve as counsel in a case appealed to a circuit court, the attorney must first be admitted to the bar of that circuit. Admission to the bar of a circuit court is granted as a matter of course to any attorney who is admitted to practice law in any state of the United States. The attorney submits an application, pays a fee, and takes the oath of admission. Local practice varies as to whether the oath is given in writing or in open court before a judge of the circuit, and most courts of appeals allow the applicant attorney to choose which method he or she prefers.

==Nomenclature==
When the courts of appeals were created in 1891, one was created for each of the nine circuits then existing, and each court was named the &quot;United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit&quot;. When a court of appeals was created for the District of Columbia in 1893, it was named the &quot;Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia&quot;, and it was renamed to the &quot;United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia&quot; in 1934. In 1948, Congress renamed all of the courts of appeals then existing to their current formal names: the court of appeals for each numbered circuit was named the &quot;United States Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit&quot;, and the &quot;United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia&quot; became the &quot;United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit&quot;. The Tenth Circuit was created in 1929 by subdividing the existing Eighth Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit was created in 1981 by subdividing the existing Fifth Circuit. The Federal Circuit was created in 1982 by the merger of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate division of the United States Court of Claims.

==Judicial councils==
Judicial councils are panels in each circuit that are charged with making &quot;necessary and appropriate orders for the effective and expeditious administration of justice&quot; within their circuits. Among their responsibilities is judicial discipline, the formulation of circuit policy, the implementation of policy directives received from the Judicial Conference of the United States, and the annual submission of a report to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts on the number and nature of orders entered during the year that relate to judicial misconduct. Judicial councils consist of the chief judge of the circuit and an equal number of circuit judges and district judges of the circuit.

==Circuit composition==

The courts of appeals, and the lower courts and specific other bodies over which they have appellate jurisdiction, are as follows:

==History==
The Judiciary Act of 1789 established three circuits, which were groups of judicial districts in which United States circuit courts were established. The original three circuits were given distinct names, rather than numbers: the Eastern, the Middle, and the Southern. Each circuit court consisted of two Supreme Court justices and the local district judge; the three circuits existed solely for the purpose of assigning the justices to a group of circuit courts. Some districts (generally the ones most difficult for an itinerant justice to reach) did not have a circuit court; in these districts the district court exercised the original jurisdiction of a circuit court. As new states were admitted to the Union, Congress often did not create circuit courts for them for a number of years.

The number of circuits remained unchanged until the year after Rhode Island ratified the Constitution, when the Midnight Judges Act reorganized the districts into six numbered circuits, and created circuit judgeships so that Supreme Court justices would no longer have to ride circuit. This Act, however, was repealed in March 1802, and Congress provided that the former circuit courts would be revived as of July 1 of that year. But it then passed the new Judiciary Act of 1802 in April, so that the revival of the old courts never took effect. The 1802 Act restored circuit riding, but with only one justice to a circuit; it therefore created six new circuits, but with slightly different compositions than the 1801 Act. These six circuits later were augmented by others. Until 1866, each new circuit (except the short-lived California Circuit) was accompanied by a newly created Supreme Court seat.

<text>Joan à Beckett Weigall, Lady Lindsay (16 November 189623 December 1984) was an Australian novelist, playwright, essayist, and visual artist. Trained in her youth as a painter, she published her first literary work in 1936 at age forty under a pseudonym, a satirical novel titled &quot;Through Darkest Pondelayo&quot;. Her second novel, &quot;Time Without Clocks&quot;, was published nearly thirty years later, and was a semi-autobiographical account of the early years of her marriage to artist Sir Daryl Lindsay.

In 1967, Lindsay published her most celebrated work, &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot;, a historical Gothic novel detailing the vanishing of three schoolgirls and their teacher at the site of a monolith during one summer. The novel sparked critical and public interest for its ambivalent presentation as a true story as well as its vague conclusion, and is widely considered to be one of the most important Australian novels. It was adapted into a 1975 film of the same name.

She was also the author of several unpublished plays, and contributed essays, short stories, and poetry to numerous journals and publications throughout her career. After the death of Lindsay&#x27;s husband in 1976, she spent her time involved in the local art community in Melbourne, and was involved in several exhibitions. Her last published work, &quot;Syd Sixpence&quot; (1982), was her first and only work of children&#x27;s literature. Lindsay died of stomach cancer in 1984, after which her home was donated to the Australian National Trust; the Lindsay estate now operates as a museum with her and her husband Daryl&#x27;s artwork and personal effects.

==Life and career==

===Early life===

Joan à Beckett Weigall was born in St Kilda East, Victoria, Australia, a suburb of Melbourne, the third daughter of Theyre à Beckett Weigall, a prominent judge. His cousin, William Arthur Callendar à Beckett, was father to Emma Minnie Boyd and thus Lindsay was related to the Boyd family including writer Martin Boyd. Her mother, Ann Sophie Weigall (née Hamilton), was the daughter of the Scottish born Sir Robert Hamilton, a Governor of Tasmania; she was a musician born and raised in Dublin. Lindsay had two sisters, Mim and Nancy, and a brother, Theyre Jr. Lindsay spent her early years in a mansion called &quot;St Margaret&#x27;s&quot;, at 151 Alma Road, East St Kilda. She described her childhood as &quot;outwardly happy and uneventful.&quot;

In 1909 at the age of thirteen, Lindsay was sent to a local boarding school, then called Carhue, to complete her education. During Lindsay&#x27;s time there the school went through a change in ownership and was renamed the Clyde Girls&#x27; Grammar School; she was a model student. The school was relocated to near Mount Macedon, five years after Joan&#x27;s final year. After graduating from Clyde, Lindsay considered becoming an architect, but decided to study art instead, enrolling at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in Melbourne in 1916. There, while studying painting, she was educated by Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin.

In 1920 she began sharing a Melbourne studio with Maie Ryan (later Lady Casey). Joan exhibited her watercolours and oils at two Melbourne exhibitions in 1920, one of which was titled &quot;The Neo-Pantechnicists&quot; and exhibited with the Victorian Artists Society. She and Casey also collaborated on an unfinished book together, titled &quot;Portrait of Anna&quot;.

===Marriage to Daryl Lindsay; early works===
While studying at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, she met fellow art student Daryl Lindsay. The two married in Marylebone, London, England on St. Valentine&#x27;s Day 1922. The day was always a special occasion for her, and she set her most famous work, &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot;, on St. Valentine&#x27;s Day.
When the couple returned to live in Australia, they renovated a farmhouse in Baxter — Mulberry Hill — and lived there until the Great Depression forced them to take up more humble lodgings in Bacchus Marsh, renting out their home until the economic situation improved. During this time, Lindsay shifted her focus from painting to writing, and wrote two plays, both of which explored the uncanny and the macabre — &quot;Cataract&quot;, and &quot;Wolf!&quot;, the latter of which was a collaboration with Margot Goyder and Ann Joske (&quot;Margot Neville&quot;), Australia&#x27;s best-known detective story writers at the time. Though neither of the plays was published, &quot;Wolf!&quot; was performed on stage in Swanage, England in May 1930.

After returning from travel in England and Europe, Lindsay published her first novel, &quot;Through Darkest Pondelayo: An account of the adventures of two English ladies on a cannibal island&quot;, in 1936, under the pseudonym Serena Livingstone-Stanley. Published by Chatto &amp; Windus in the United Kingdom, the novel is structured as a parody of popular travel books of the time but filled with intentional grammatical errors, also functioning as a satire on English tourists abroad. According to Lindsay&#x27;s cousin Martin Boyd, the novel was &quot;one of the best collections of malapropisms in the English language.&quot; Lindsay helped Boyd write the outline for his novel, &quot;Nuns in Jeopardy&quot; (1940).

Lindsay also contributed articles, reviews and stories to various magazines and newspapers on art, literature and prominent people. In 1928, she interviewed actress Margaret Bannerman for Victoria&#x27;s &quot;The Weekly Courier&quot;, and, in 1941, co-authored the &quot;History of the Australian Red Cross&quot; with husband Daryl. In 1942, Lindsay published an essay of literary criticism on novelist George Moore in &quot;The Age&quot;, titled &quot;A Modern of the Nineties. George Moore: literary craftsman.&quot;

During this period, Daryl Lindsay abandoned painting to become Director of the National Gallery of Victoria, a position he held between 1942 and 1955. The position necessitated their relocation to Melbourne until his retirement. They retained their country home during their Victoria sojourn. When Daryl was knighted in 1956, Joan became known as Lady Lindsay.

Her semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Time Without Clocks&quot; describes her wedding and idyllic early married life. The work takes its title from a strange ability which Joan described herself as having, of stopping clocks and machinery when she came close. The title also plays on the idea that this period in her life was unstructured and free. This was followed with &quot;Facts Soft and Hard&quot;, a humorous, semi-autobiographical account of the Lindsays&#x27; travels in the United States while Daryl was on a Fulbright Award, which took the couple to New York City on a study tour of American art collections held by the Carnegie Corporation.

===&quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot;===
&quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot;, published in 1967, is Lindsay&#x27;s best known work. Lindsay wrote the novel over a four-week period at her home Mulberry Hill in Baxter, on Victoria&#x27;s Mornington Peninsula, and constructed it around the real-life Hanging Rock, a monolith that had fascinated her since her childhood. She compared the story to the work of Henry James, citing the &quot;book about the children in a haunted house with a governess&quot; (&quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;).

The novel is historical fiction, though Lindsay dropped hints that it was based on an actual event, and is framed as such in the novel&#x27;s introduction. An ending that explained the girls&#x27; fates, in draft form, was excised by her publisher prior to publication. The final chapter was published only in 1987 as a standalone book titled &quot;The Secret of Hanging Rock&quot;, and also included critical commentary and interpretive theories on the novel. Lindsay based Appleyard College, the setting for the novel, on the school that she had attended, Clyde Girls Grammar School (Clyde School), at East St Kilda, Melbourne—which in 1919 was transferred to Woodend, Victoria, in the immediate vicinity of Hanging Rock.

In a 1974 interview, Lindsay addressed readers&#x27; and critics&#x27; questioning about the novel&#x27;s ambiguous conclusion, saying:Well, it was written as a mystery and it remains a mystery. If you can draw your own conclusions, that&#x27;s fine, but I don&#x27;t think that it matters. I wrote that book as a sort of atmosphere of a place, and it was like dropping a stone into the water. I felt that story, if you call it a story—that the thing that happened on St. Valentine&#x27;s Day went on spreading, out and out and out, in circles.

The novel&#x27;s ambiguous conclusion led to significant interest from both public and critical readers, and the novel has drawn comparisons from literary critics to the work of E.M. Forster and Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was made into a 1975 feature film by producers Patricia Lovell, Hal and Jim McElroy, and director Peter Weir, which was hailed as initiating the revival of Australian cinema. A re-printing of the novel in 1975 by Penguin Books in Australia sold over 350,000 copies, making it Penguin Australia&#x27;s best-selling novel to date (second, overall, only to Albert Facey&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A Fortunate Life&quot;).

===Later life and death===
In 1969, Lindsay suffered severe injuries in a car accident and she required months of convalescence. Daryl Lindsay died on Christmas Day 1976. Lady Lindsay&#x27;s later years were spent invested in visual arts, with frequent visits to the Lyceum Club in Melbourne, and to the McClelland Gallery in Langwarrin, where she was involved in the local art community. She painted several works in her later years, and she was lauded by the art critic, Alan McCulloch.

In 1972, she reunited with Lady Maie Casey and held an art exhibition at the McLelland in Langwarrin. Artist Rick Amor and his children, who had lived in a cottage of Lindsay&#x27;s property, led her to resurrect an unpublished children&#x27;s book she had written, titled &quot;Syd Sixpence&quot;, which she published in 1982. Amor supplied illustrations for the book, which tells the story of Syd, an anthropomorphic sixpence coin&#x27;s adventures on the ocean floor. Lindsay also worked on another novel, entitled &quot;Love at the Billabong&quot;, which was left unfinished.

Lindsay died of stomach cancer at Peninsula Private Hospital in Frankston, Melbourne on 23 December 1984, aged 88. She was cremated, and her ashes are interred at Creswick Cemetery in Creswick, Shire of Hepburn in Victoria, Australia. As the Lindsays had no children, their Mulberry Hill home in Langwarrin South, Victoria was donated at her wishes to the National Trust upon her death. The Mulberry Hill estate is open to the public for self-guided tours, and contains both Joan and Daryl Lindsay&#x27;s original artwork and personal possessions.

Lindsay&#x27;s visual artwork has been exhibited posthumously as part of the National Women&#x27;s Art Exhibition in Australia.

In 2025, foremost Australian biographer, Brenda Niall published Lindsay&#x27;s biography, &quot;Joan Lindsay. The hidden life of the woman who wrote&quot; Picnic at Hanging Rock.

<doc id="70235" wikidata="Q1614849" url="?curid=70235" title="United States district court">
<text>The United States district courts are the trial courts of the U.S. federal judiciary. There is one district court for each federal judicial district. Each district covers one U.S. state or a portion of a state. There is at least one federal courthouse in each district, and many districts have more than one. District court decisions are appealed to the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in which they reside, except for certain specialized cases that are appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.

District courts are courts of law, equity, and admiralty, and can hear both civil and criminal cases. But unlike U.S. state courts, federal district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and can only hear cases that involve disputes between residents of different states, questions of federal law, or federal crimes.

==Legal basis==

Unlike the U.S. Supreme Court, which was expressly established by Article III of the Constitution, the district courts were established by Congress pursuant to authority delegated by Article III through the enacting of a federal statute, the Judiciary Act of 1789. There is no constitutional requirement that district courts exist at all.

During the drafting and ratification of the Constitution, some opponents of a strong federal judiciary argued that the federal courts ought to be limited to the Supreme Court, which would hear appeals only from state courts. In other words, the state courts would be treated as federal tribunals under Article I of the Constitution for the purpose of hearing disputes under federal law, but their judges would not become officers of the federal government. Edward Carrington advocated this position in a letter to James Madison, and it was also discussed by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 81. However, this view did not prevail, and the first Congress created the district court system that is still in place today. Pursuant to the Constitution, nonetheless, state courts retain the power of concurrent jurisdiction in most federal matters.

When the Act was first passed, there were thirteen districts created among the eleven states which had ratified the Constitution by that point. When North Carolina and Rhode Island voted to ratify, a district was created for each of them, bringing the number of districts to fifteen.

The territories (insular areas) of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the United States Virgin Islands each have one territorial court; these courts are called &quot;district courts&quot; and exercise the same jurisdiction as district courts, but differ from district courts in that territorial courts are Article IV courts, with judges who serve ten-year terms rather than the lifetime tenure of judges of Article III courts, such as the district court judges.

American Samoa does not have a district court or a federal territorial court, and so federal matters there are sent to either the District of Columbia or Hawaii. The Philippines were previously part of the United States but were never part of the U.S. federal court system.

== Geography ==
There are 89 districts in the 50 states, with a total of 94 districts including territories. There is at least one judicial district for each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

Each state has between one and four districts. For states with multiple districts, they are named geographically. States with two districts all give them either Northern–Southern or Western–Eastern designations. Most states with three districts add a Middle District, with two exceptions: Illinois has a Central District instead of a Middle District, and Oklahoma has Northern, Western, and Eastern Districts. Of the three states with four districts, New York and Texas use all four directional designations, while California has a Central District and no Western District.

==Other federal trial courts==

There are other federal trial courts that have nationwide jurisdiction over certain types of cases, but the district court also has concurrent jurisdiction over many of those cases, and the district court is the only one with jurisdiction over civilian criminal cases.

The United States Court of International Trade addresses cases involving international trade and customs issues. The United States Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over most claims for money damages against the United States, including disputes over federal contracts, unlawful takings of private property by the federal government, and suits for injury on federal property or by a federal employee. The United States Tax Court has jurisdiction over contested pre-assessment determinations of taxes.

==Judges==

A judge of a United States district court is officially titled a &quot;United States District Judge&quot;. Other federal judges, including circuit judges and Supreme Court justices, can also sit in a district court upon assignment by the chief judge of the circuit or by the Chief Justice of the United States. The number of judges in each district court (and the structure of the judicial system generally) is set by Congress in the United States Code. The president appoints the federal judges for terms of good behavior (subject to the advice and consent of the Senate), so the nominees often share at least some of his or her convictions. In states represented by a senator of the president&#x27;s party, the senator (or the more senior of them if both senators are of the president&#x27;s party) has substantial input into the nominating process, and through a tradition known as senatorial courtesy can exercise an unofficial veto over a nominee unacceptable to the senator.

Federal magistrate judges are appointed by each district court pursuant to statute. They are appointed for an eight-year term and may be reappointed for additional eight-year terms. A magistrate judge may be removed &quot;for incompetency, misconduct, neglect of duty, or physical or mental disability&quot;. A magistrate judgeship may be a stepping stone to a district judgeship nomination.

District judges usually concentrate on managing their court&#x27;s overall caseload, supervising trials, and writing opinions in response to important motions like the motion for summary judgment. Since the 1960s, routine tasks like resolving discovery disputes can, in the district judge&#x27;s discretion, be referred to magistrate judges. Magistrate judges can also be requested to prepare reports and recommendations on contested matters for the district judge&#x27;s consideration or, with the consent of all parties, to assume complete jurisdiction over a case including conducting the trial.

With the exception of the territorial courts (Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands), federal district judges are Article III judges appointed for life, and can be removed involuntarily only when they violate the standard of &quot;good behavior&quot;. The sole method of involuntary removal of a judge is through impeachment by the United States House of Representatives followed by a trial in the United States Senate and a conviction by a two-thirds vote. Otherwise, a judge, even if convicted of a felony criminal offense by a jury, is entitled to hold office until retirement or death. In the history of the United States, twelve judges have been impeached by the House, and seven have been removed following conviction in the Senate. (For a table that includes the twelve impeached judges, see Impeachment in the United States.)

A judge who has reached the age of 65 (or has become disabled) may retire or elect to go on senior status and keep working. Such senior judges are not counted in the quota of active judges for the district and do only whatever work they are assigned by the chief judge of the district, but they keep their offices (called &quot;chambers&quot;) and staff, and many of them work full-time.

As of 2010, there were 678 authorized district court judgeships.

A federal judge is addressed in writing as &quot;The Honorable John/Jane Doe&quot; or &quot;Hon. John/Jane Doe&quot; and in speech as &quot;Judge&quot; or &quot;Judge Doe&quot; or, when presiding in court, &quot;Your Honor&quot;.

==Clerks==

Each district court appoints a clerk, who is responsible for overseeing filings made with the court, maintaining the court&#x27;s records, processing fees, fines, and restitution, and managing the non-judicial work of the court, including information technology, budget, procurement, human resources, and financial. Clerks may appoint deputies, clerical assistants, and employees to carry out the work of the court. The clerk of each district court must reside in the district for which the clerk is appointed, except that the clerk of the District of Columbia and the clerk of the Southern District of New York may reside within twenty miles of their respective districts.

The Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized the Supreme Court and the judge of each U.S. District Court to appoint a clerk to assist with the administration of federal judicial business in those courts. The clerk for each district court was to also serve as clerk of the corresponding circuit court. The Judiciary Act required each clerk to issue the writs summoning jurors and &quot;to record the decrees, judgments and determinations of the court of which he is clerk.&quot;

The Judicial Code (28 U.S.C. § 751) provides that the clerk is appointed, and may be removed, by the court. The clerk&#x27;s duties are prescribed by the statute, by the court&#x27;s customs and practices, and by policy established by the Judicial Conference of the United States. The clerk is appointed by order of the court en banc to serve the entire court. The role of the clerk and deputies or assistants should not be confused with the judges&#x27; law clerks, who assist the judges by conducting research and preparing drafts of opinions.

To be eligible to serve as a clerk, a person must have a minimum of 10 years of progressively responsible administrative experience in public service or business that provides a thorough understanding of organizational, procedural, and human aspects of managing an organization, and at least 3 of the 10 years must have been in a position of substantial management responsibility. An attorney may substitute the active practice of law on a year-for-year basis for the management or administrative experience requirement. Clerks do not have to be licensed attorneys, but some courts specify that a law degree is a preference for employment.

==Jurisdiction==

Unlike some state courts, the power of federal courts to hear cases and controversies is strictly limited. Federal courts may not decide every case that happens to come before them. In order for a district court to entertain a lawsuit, Congress must first grant the court subject matter jurisdiction over the type of dispute in question.

The district courts exercise original jurisdiction over—that is, they are empowered to conduct trials in—the following types of cases:

* Civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States;
* Certain civil actions between citizens of different states or citizens of a state and a foreign state;
* Civil actions within the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction of the United States;
* Criminal prosecutions brought by the United States;
* Civil actions in which the United States is a party; and
* Many other types of cases and controversies

For most of these cases, the jurisdiction of the federal district courts is concurrent with that of the state courts. In other words, a plaintiff can choose to bring these cases in either a federal district court or a state court. Congress has established a procedure whereby a party, typically the defendant, can &quot;remove&quot; a case from state court to federal court, provided that the federal court also has original jurisdiction over the matter (meaning that the case could have been filed in federal court initially). If the party that initially filed the case in state court believes that removal was improper, that party can ask the district court to &quot;remand&quot; the case to the state court system. For certain matters, such as patent and copyright infringement disputes and prosecutions for federal crimes, the jurisdiction of the district courts is exclusive of that of the state courts, meaning that only federal courts can hear those cases.

In addition to their original jurisdiction, the district courts have appellate jurisdiction over a very limited class of judgments, orders, and decrees.

==Attorneys==

In order to represent a party in a case in a district court, a person must be an attorney at law and generally must be admitted to the bar of that particular court. The United States usually does not have a separate bar examination for federal practice (except with respect to patent practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office). Admission to the bar of a district court is generally available to any attorney who is admitted to practice law in the state where the district court sits.

56 districts (around 60% of all district courts) require an attorney to be admitted to practice in the state where the district court sits. The other 39 districts (around 40% of all district courts) extend admission to certain lawyers admitted in other states, although conditions vary from court to court. For example, the district courts in New York City (Southern District of New York and Eastern District of New York) extend admission to attorneys admitted to the bar in Connecticut or Vermont and to the district court in that state, but otherwise require attorneys to be admitted to the New York bar. Only 13 districts extend admission to attorneys admitted to any U.S. state bar.

The attorney generally submits an application with a fee and takes the oath of admission. Local practice varies as to whether the oath is given in writing or in open court before a judge of the district. A &quot;sponsor&quot; admitted to the court&#x27;s bar is often required. Several district courts require attorneys seeking admission to their bars to take an additional bar examination on federal law, including the following: the Southern District of Ohio, the Northern District of Florida, and the District of Puerto Rico.

&quot;Pro hac vice&quot; admission is also available in most federal district courts on a case-by-case basis. Most district courts require &quot;pro hac vice&quot; attorneys to associate with an attorney admitted to practice before the court.

==Appeals==
Generally, a final ruling by a district court in either a civil or a criminal case can be appealed to the United States court of appeals in the federal judicial circuit in which the district court is located, except that some district court rulings involving patents and certain other specialized matters must be appealed instead to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and in a very few cases the appeal may be taken directly to the United States Supreme Court.

==Largest and busiest district courts==

The Central District of California is the largest federal district by population; it includes all five counties that make up Greater Los Angeles. By contrast, New York City and the surrounding metropolitan area are divided between the Southern District of New York (which includes Manhattan, The Bronx and Westchester County) and the Eastern District of New York (which includes Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Nassau County and Suffolk County). New York suburbs in Connecticut and New Jersey are covered by the District of Connecticut and District of New Jersey, respectively.

The Southern District of New York and the Central District of California are the largest federal districts by number of judges, with 28 judges each.

In 2007, the busiest district courts in terms of criminal federal felony filings were the District of New Mexico, Western District of Texas, Southern District of Texas, and the District of Arizona. These four districts all share the border with Mexico. A crackdown on illegal immigration resulted in 75 percent of the criminal cases filed in the 94 district courts in 2007 being filed in these four districts and the other district that borders Mexico, the Southern District of California. The busiest patent litigation court is the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, with the most patent lawsuits filed there nearly every year.

==List of district courts==
==Extinct district courts==

===Subdivided district courts===

Most extinct district courts have disappeared by being divided into smaller districts. The following courts were subdivided out of existence: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin.

===Other abolished district courts===
On rare occasions, an extinct district court was extinguished by merging it with other district courts. In every case except one, this has restored a district court that had been subdivided:

* Between 1794 and 1797, the United States District Court for the District of North Carolina was divided into the United States district courts for the districts of Edenton, New Bern, and Wilmington.
* Between 1801 and 1802, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey was divided into the United States district courts for the districts of East Jersey and West Jersey.
* When California was admitted as a state in 1850, it was initially divided into two districts, the Northern and the Southern. The Southern District of California was abolished on July 27, 1866, and the State made to constitute one district, the statute providing that the Judge of the Northern District exercise the powers of the United States District Court for the District of California, and that all records of the Southern District Court be delivered to the Clerk of the Northern District Court. Twenty years later, on August 5, 1886, Congress re-created the Southern District of California.
* Between 1911 and 1961, the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina was divided into the United States district courts for the Eastern and Western districts of South Carolina.
* The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois was eliminated and a new United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois was created in its place on October 2, 1978.

There are a few additional extinct district courts that fall into neither of the above two patterns.

* From 1801 to 1802, the District of Columbia and pieces of Maryland and Virginia formed the United States District Court for the District of Potomac, which was the first United States district court to cross state lines. During the same period, the United States District Court for the District of Norfolk was carved out of another piece of Virginia. The United States district courts for the districts of Maryland and Virginia remained during this brief period.
* From 1801 to 1802, and again from 1802 to 1872, the state of North Carolina was subdivided into the United States district courts for the districts of Albemarle, Cape Fear, and Pamptico. These courts were extinguished when the state was reorganized into the United States district courts for the Eastern and Western districts of North Carolina.
* United States District Court for the District of Orleans. This court was renamed the United States District Court for the District of Louisiana when the Territory of Orleans became the State of Louisiana.
* United States District Court for the Canal Zone. This court was abolished, effective March 31, 1982, as part of the process of returning the Canal Zone to Panama. Cases then pending in the Canal Zone court were transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans.
* United States Court for China. This court functioned as a district court between 1906 and 1943. It had jurisdiction over American citizens in China.

<text>United States bankruptcy courts are courts created under Article I of the United States Constitution. The current system of bankruptcy courts was created by the United States Congress in 1978, effective April 1, 1984. United States bankruptcy courts function as units of the district courts and have subject-matter jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases. The federal district courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases arising under the bankruptcy code, (see ), and bankruptcy cases cannot be filed in state court. Each of the 94 federal judicial districts handles bankruptcy matters.

Technically, the United States district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters (see ). However, each such district court may, by order, &quot;refer&quot; bankruptcy matters to the bankruptcy court (see ). As a practical matter, most district courts have a standing &quot;reference&quot; order to that effect, so that all bankruptcy cases in that district are handled, at least initially, by the bankruptcy court. In unusual circumstances, a district court may in a particular case &quot;withdraw the reference&quot; (i.e., take the case or a particular proceeding within the case away from the bankruptcy court and decide the matter itself) under .

The overwhelming majority of all proceedings in bankruptcy are held before a United States bankruptcy judge, whose decisions are subject to appeals to the district court. In some judicial circuits, appeals may be taken to a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP). The bankruptcy judges in each judicial district in regular active service constitute a &quot;unit&quot; of the applicable United States district court (see ). The bankruptcy judge is appointed for a renewable term of 14 years by the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the applicable district is located (see ).

The Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (FRBP) govern procedure in the U.S. bankruptcy courts.

Decisions of the bankruptcy courts are not collected and published in an official reporter produced by the government. Instead, the &quot;de facto&quot; official source for opinions of the bankruptcy courts is &quot;West&#x27;s Bankruptcy Reporter&quot;, published privately by Thomson West.

Bankruptcy courts appoint a trustee to represent the interests of the creditors and administer the cases. The U.S. Trustee appoints Chapter 7 trustees for a renewable period of 1 year, Chapter 13 trustees are &quot;standing trustees&quot; who administer cases in a specific geographic region.

<text>The Victorian Artists Society, which can trace its establishment to 1856 in Melbourne, promotes artistic education, art classes and gallery hire exhibition in Australia. It was formed in March 1888 when the Victorian Academy of Arts (previously Victorian Society of Fine Arts) and the Australian Artists&#x27; Association amalgamated.

The Victorian Artists’ Society is a not-for-profit organisation and charity registered with the Victorian government. The Artists&#x27; Society routinely practices a range of art forms and styles through classes and gatherings in their permanent home, a heritage-listed bluestone building on Albert Street, Melbourne, opposite St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. As of 2021, the Victorian Artists&#x27; Society premises include four galleries, members’ rooms, an administrative office, and the original bluestone studio which operates as an art school. The original studio was not finished until 1902.

The general public can view the seasonal collections of artworks in the gallery or buy artworks. The gallery is open seven days a week and the cost is free entry. New exhibitions are held fortnightly within the five galleries.

==History==
The Victorian Society of Fine Arts, a forerunner to the Victorian Academy of Arts, was established in 1856. The Victorian Academy of Arts was formed in 1870 with &quot;about twenty artists and amateurs&quot; amongst its first members, including Eliezer Levi Montefiore.

The Australian Artists&#x27; Association held its first exhibition in 1886, with works by Tom Roberts, Louis Buvelot, Frederick McCubbin, and Arthur Streeton.

In March 1888 the academy and the Association amalgamated, creating the Victorian Artists Society. The founding president of the new Society was Joseph Anderson Panton; later presidents included Frederick McCubbin and Paul Raphael Montford.

The premises at 430 Albert Street in East Melbourne were erected for the society in 1888, enlarged in 1892 and modernised in 1953. Facilities include four galleries, teaching studio, members room, offices and other ancillary facilities.
During its early establishment, the Artists’ Society met in a private house in St. Kilda. Its founding members included landscape painter Louis Buvelot, painter Hubert de Castella and etcher J.A. Panton. The Artists’ Society was known for throwing parties and picnics at Brighton. By the 1890s, there were 400 members.

This historical building was not limited to fine arts and was also established as a music conservatory that offered singing lessons by Nellie Melba. Melba taught music lessons at the historical building from 1915 until close to her death in 1931. She would perform to crowds outside from the balcony of the house. In 2014, the Society honoured Melba with a special plaque for the gallery to record her musical history at the Victorian Artists’ Society.
The Artists’ Society was a starting point for young artists of the Heidelberg school, a Victorian impressionist art movement of the 19th century, to exhibit their work and make their first major sales. Artists of the Heidelberg school who were active members of the Victorian Artists’ Society included Charles Conder, Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton, and Tom Roberts.

Max Meldrum, the Victorian Artists’ Society president in 1917, taught tonal realism at the gallery studio. In 1918 he left the Victorian Artists’ Society to form ‘The Society of Twenty Melbourne Painters’. Meldrum ran this society in its early stages from his studio in Hardware Chambers, Elizabeth Street, Melbourne. They later changed their name to Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.

Most of the early exhibitors in the Society were women.

Albert Tucker, an Australian artist, and member of the Heide Circle, went to night art classes at the Victorian Artists’ Society studio in the 1930s.

In 1938, at a VAS meeting, artists interested in contemporary styles decided to form Contemporary Artists’ Society (CAS). CAS is still active.

==Today==
&quot;As of 2021&quot;

The Victorian Artists Society is a gallery and public learning centre offering public exhibitions, art lessons, gallery space for hire, workshops, and paid opportunities for working Victorian artists.

Art classes and workshops are offered to a minimum age of 16 and operate in four term sessions a year. Classes include painting, watercolour, pastel, oil, acrylic, drawing, and sculpture. 18 different art classes are offered each week in the studio. The gallery viewing hours operate from 10am to 4pm Monday to Friday, and 1pm to 4pm on Saturday and Sunday. The gallery is closed on public holidays. Classes are held in the studio six days a week.

Membership is restricted to 1000, a figure last reached in 1979, and is open for new members to join for approximately $90. Membership is open to all persons interested in the fine arts, with the emphasis on practising artists.

As of 2021, the current society president is Eileen Mackley, who joined the VAS board 29 December 2008, and was appointed president 5 December 2013. Ron Smith is head of media enquiries.

Exhibitions are held annually, including the seasonal spring, summer, autumn and winter exhibitions, with awards given at each. Every year, the society presents the ‘Mavis Little VAS Artist of the Year Award’ to the artist receiving the most votes from exhibitors through that year.

In 2020, The Victorian Artists’ Society launched an online art gallery called ‘Art for Sale,’ creating the opportunity for local Victorian artists to sell their works to a domestic and international online audience. The mediums of art for sale included paintings, sculptures, prints and digital art. This free of charge online event ran from 26 August to 31 December 2020.

In 2020, the Victorian Artists’ Society celebrated their 150th anniversary. The society released with historical information, drawings, and photographs, titled ‘Victorian Artists Society 1870 – 2020 Celebrating 150 Years’, edited by Rosemary Noble. To celebrate 150 years of the Artists’ Society on March 10, 2020, the Governor of Victoria, Linda Dessau AC, gave a speech saying “almost every notable Australian painter from the late 19th to early 20th centuries was associated with the VAS. Fortunately for the people of Victoria, and thanks to the National Gallery of Victoria, many of their works grace the walls at Government House.”

== Building restoration ==

The Victorian Artists’ Society building is Heritage and National Trust listed. In 1873, a grant of land on Albert street became available and allowed for a modest structure. The building is opposite St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and 600m from Parliament House. According to Professor Miles Lewis of the Australian Architectural Index, the building was originally one-story with measurements of 14.3m x 9.1 x 6m, built by Corben &amp; Stuart. The Romanesque-style building was originally designed by architect Leonard Terry, a designer of warehouses and banks, and Richard Speight.

The house underwent renovations in the late 1970s, installing fluorescent lighting, which they later changed again. Although the building has been renovated, the original 1873 studio and 1892 staircase, galleries, and balcony remain. The original Baltic pine floor, tables, and easels still remain the same. An elevator has been added.

In 2015, the historic building was threatened by severe water damage and needed urgent restoration repairs for a cost of approximately $1 million. The building needed cosmetic attention, roof restoration, replastering, replumbing, and new electricity installed. The society began the restoration funded entirely by donations and money raised. In May 2015, twenty of the society&#x27;s artists participated in a mass portrait painting called “People Painting People,” with several well-known members of the public, including former Victorian Police commissioner Ken Lay, as the artist subjects. This fundraiser event and multiple others contributed to the money raised for the building restoration. Australian arts and heritage consultant, Tracey Avery advised and reported on paint finishes, new colour schemes and prepared for approval by Heritage Victoria. After approximately five years of renovations and $2.5 million raised by both members and donors, the building restoration was complete.

== Finances ==
The Victorian Artist&#x27;s Society is a non-for-profit and charitable organisation as of its registration in 2012. Many members of the society council work on a volunteer basis. The Society&#x27;s president, Eileen Mackley, is the VAS Treasurer.

According to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission AIS report published 30 July 2020, 9.46% of the total gross income of the Victorian Artists’ Society was from donations and bequests. In the year 2020, over $650,000 of the society&#x27;s gross income was from donations and bequests, which in large part paid for the completion of the building restoration. Approximately 91.64% of their total expenses is on employee salaries. In 2020, the year of COVID-19, there were no significant changes in the company&#x27;s activity during the financial year.

== Working artists in Victoria ==

After the amalgamation forming the Victorian Artists’ Society in 1888, distinguished artists associated with the Victorian Artists’ Society included Tom Roberts, Charles Conder, and Arthur Streeton. Arthur Ernest Streeton painted ‘Settler’s Camp’ and ‘Pastoral’, both exhibited and sold at the Victorian Artists Society in 1888. He took inspiration for his portraits from the Yarra River and its bridges. After his time at the Victorian Artists Society, Streeton worked for the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1891. Tom Roberts, alongside Streeton a former member of the Artists’ Society has been called the founder of Australian Impressionism. Both artists regularly exhibited oil paintings.

Charles Conder studied at the Art Society School during the 1880s where he exhibited his impressionist painting &quot;‘Departure of the Orient – Circular Quay’&quot; in 1888. Conder sold this painting to the Art Gallery of New South Wales that same year, before leaving to work with Streeton in Melbourne and joining the Victorian Artists’ Society. After joining the Society, he exhibited paintings ‘&quot;Coogee Bay’&quot; 1888, and ‘&quot;A Holiday at Mentone’&quot; 1888. Conder, along with Roberts, McCubbin, and Streeton became contributors to &quot;The 9 by 5 Impressionism Exhibition&quot; in August 1889. This exhibition represented impressions of bushlands and city life during a formative period of national Australian history.

Esther Paterson, born in 1893, was the longest-serving female office bearer of the Victorian Artist&#x27;s Society. She was also an active member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. Similar to the Victorian Artists’ Society, the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, founded in 1902, is the oldest organisation for women artists in Australia. Many members of the Victorian Artists Society are also members of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors.

Similar societies to the Victorian Artists’ Society which provide opportunities and exhibitions for working artists in Victoria include Hawthorn Artist Society, Heidelberg Artists Society, and Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.

== Exhibitions and awards ==
The Victorian Artists’ Society holds changing exhibitions throughout the year. In the five galleries, new exhibitions are held every two to three weeks. Exhibitions range from retrospective exhibitions of former VAS members to acrylic landscapes to contemporary works focusing on the raw beauty of nature. The Artists&#x27; Society holds eleven awarded exhibitions a year for members including, Mavis Little VAS Artist of the Year Award, The Norma Bull Portraiture Scholarship, The VAS George Hicks Foundation Contemporary Exhibition, VAS Autumn Select Exhibition, VAS Maritime Exhibition, VAS Portrait Exhibition, VAS Spring Select Exhibition, and the VAS Winter Select Exhibition. The Mavis Little Artist of the Year Award is a $10,000 prize and solo exhibition and is sponsored by the Hansen Little Foundation.

The Artist of the Year Award was introduced by Robert Miller in 1973.

In October 2019, the newly renovated Victorian Artists’ Society hosted “FIVE Exhibition” by the FIVE Melbourne Art Group. This exhibition included landscapes, streetscapes, and portrait paintings from Ted Dansey, Mary Hyde, Julian Bruere, John Hunt, and Lucille Tam. This exhibition was free entry.

<text>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC) is an executive department of the U.S. federal government. It is responsible for gathering data for business and governmental decision making, establishing industrial standards, catalyzing economic development, promoting foreign direct investment, and safeguarding national economic security. 

The Department of Commerce is one of four federal agencies authorized to appoint personnel in the United States Foreign Service, and its NOAA Corps — formerly the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps — is one of the eight branches of the uniformed services of the United States. During a large-scale disaster or catastrophe, it assumes the coordinating responsibilities for the economic recovery support function under the national disaster recovery framework. Since 2023, it has lead U.S. government activities related to safe artificial intelligence development and, from 1913 to 1939, it managed the National Aquarium.

The department is headed by the secretary of commerce, who is a member of the president&#x27;s Cabinet and tenth in the United States presidential line of succession. It is headquartered in the Herbert C. Hoover Building in Washington, D.C.

==Mission==
The Department of Commerce renewed its mission statement in its 2022-2026 strategic plan: 

The responsibilities of its major operating units include weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and fisheries management (NOAA); promoting U.S. exports and attracting foreign direct investment (International Trade Administration); producing the decennial census and other vital and economic statistics (Bureau of the Census); regulating the export of sensitive technologies (Bureau of Industry and Security); registering patents, trademarks, and copyrights (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office); managing and preserving the United States customary system of weights and measures (National Institute of Standards and Technology); maintaining the national interoperable broadband emergency network (FirstNet Authority); and coordinating economic recovery following a major disaster (Economic Development Administration).
==History==
===Organizational history===
The department was originally created as the United States Department of Commerce and Labor on February 14, 1903. It was subsequently renamed the Department of Commerce on March 4, 1913, as the bureaus and agencies specializing in labor were transferred to the new Department of Labor.

Since its creation, the Commerce Department has seen various agencies and administrative offices shift in and out of its organizational structure. The United States Patent and Trademark Office was transferred from the Interior Department into the Commerce Department in 1925. The Federal Employment Stabilization Office existed within the department from 1931 to 1939. In 1940, the Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service) was transferred from the Agriculture Department, and the Civil Aeronautics Authority was also merged into the Commerce Department. In 1949, the Public Roads Administration was added to the department after the Federal Works Agency was dismantled.

In 1958, the independent Federal Aviation Agency was created and the Civil Aeronautics Authority was abolished. The United States Travel Service was established by the United States Secretary of Commerce on July 1, 1961, pursuant to the International Travel Act of 1961 (75 Stat. 129; 22 U.S.C. 2121 note) The Economic Development Administration was created in 1965. In 1966, the Bureau of Public Roads was transferred to the newly created Department of Transportation. The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) was created on March 5, 1969, originally established by President Richard M. Nixon as the Office of Minority Business Enterprise.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was created on October 3, 1970.

The Cabinet Council on Commerce and Trade was one of multiple Cabinet Councils established in the United States on or about February 26, 1981 by the Reagan Administration.

====2020 data breach====
In 2020, the Department of Commerce suffered a data breach following a cyberattack likely conducted by a nation state adversary, possibly Russia.

===Herbert Hoover as secretary of commerce===
Herbert Hoover was appointed Secretary of Commerce in 1921 by then-President Warren G. Harding. Hoover was, by far, the most active secretary in the history of the department until the end of his position in 1928.

After his election as president in 1920, Warren G. Harding rewarded Hoover for his support, offering to appoint him as either Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of Commerce. Secretary of Commerce was considered a minor Cabinet post, with limited and vaguely defined responsibilities, but Hoover, emphasizing his identity as a businessman, accepted the position. In sharp contrast to the Interior Department, there were no scandals at Commerce.

Hoover envisioned the Commerce Department as the hub of the nation&#x27;s growth and stability. His experience mobilizing the war-time economy convinced him that the federal government could promote efficiency by eliminating waste, increasing production, encouraging the adoption of data-based practices, investing in infrastructure, and conserving natural resources. Contemporaries described Hoover&#x27;s approach as a &quot;third alternative&quot; between &quot;unrestrained capitalism&quot; and socialism, which was becoming increasingly popular in Europe. Hoover sought to foster a balance among labor, capital, and the government, and for this he has been variously labeled a &quot;corporatist&quot; or an associationalist.

Hoover demanded, and received, authority to coordinate economic affairs throughout the government. He created many sub-departments and committees, overseeing and regulating everything from manufacturing statistics to air travel. In some instances he &quot;seized&quot; control of responsibilities from other Cabinet departments when he deemed that they were not carrying out their responsibilities well; some began referring to him as the &quot;Secretary of Commerce and Under-Secretary of all other departments&quot;. In response to the Depression of 1920–21, he convinced Harding to assemble a presidential commission on unemployment, which encouraged local governments to engage in countercyclical infrastructure spending. He endorsed much of Mellon&#x27;s tax reduction program, but favored a more progressive tax system and opposed the treasury secretary&#x27;s efforts to eliminate the estate tax.

====Radio and travel====
When Hoover joined the department, almost no families had radios; when he became president in 1929, 10 million owned one, and most of the rest listened in a nearby home, store or restaurant. Hoover&#x27;s department set the policies that shaped the entire new industry. Hoover&#x27;s radio conferences played a key role in the organization, development, and regulation of radio broadcasting. Hoover also helped pass the Radio Act of 1927, which allowed the government to intervene and abolish radio stations that were deemed &quot;non-useful&quot; to the public. Hoover&#x27;s attempts at regulating radio were not supported by all congressmen, and he received much opposition from the Senate and from radio station owners.
Hoover was also influential in the early development of air travel, and he sought to create a thriving private industry boosted by indirect government subsidies. He encouraged the development of emergency landing fields, required all runways to be equipped with lights and radio beams, and encouraged farmers to make use of planes for crop dusting. He also established the federal government&#x27;s power to inspect planes and license pilots, setting a precedent for the later Federal Aviation Administration.

As Commerce Secretary, Hoover hosted national conferences on street traffic collectively known as the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety. Hoover&#x27;s chief objective was to address the growing casualty toll of traffic accidents, but the scope of the conferences grew and soon embraced motor vehicle standards, rules of the road, and urban traffic control. He left the invited interest groups to negotiate agreements among themselves, which were then presented for adoption by states and localities. Because automotive trade associations were the best organized, many of the positions taken by the conferences reflected their interests. The conferences issued a model Uniform Vehicle Code for adoption by the states, and a Model Municipal Traffic Ordinance for adoption by cities. Both were widely influential, promoting greater uniformity between jurisdictions and tending to promote the automobile&#x27;s priority in city streets.

====Other Hoover initiatives====
With the goal of encouraging wise business investments, Hoover made the Commerce Department a clearinghouse of information. He recruited numerous academics from various fields and tasked them with publishing reports on different aspects of the economy, including steel production and films. To eliminate waste, he encouraged the standardization of products like automobile tires and baby bottle nipples. Other efforts at eliminating waste included reducing labor losses from trade disputes and seasonal fluctuations, reducing industrial losses from accident and injury, and reducing the amount of crude oil spilled during extraction and shipping. He promoted international trade by opening overseas offices to advise businessmen. Hoover was especially eager to promote Hollywood films overseas.

His &quot;Own Your Own Home&quot; campaign was a collaboration to promote ownership of single-family dwellings, with groups such as the Better Houses in America movement, the Architects&#x27; Small House Service Bureau, and the Home Modernizing Bureau. He worked with bankers and the savings and loan industry to promote the new long-term home mortgage, which dramatically stimulated home construction. Other accomplishments included winning the agreement of U.S. Steel to adopt an eight-hour workday, and the fostering of the Colorado River Compact, a water rights compact among Southwestern states.

===Foreign economic policy===
The department has always been involved in promoting international non-financial business. It stations commercial attachés at embassies around the world. Currently, the key sub-agencies are the International Trade Administration, and the Bureau of Industry and Security. The ITA provides technical expertise to numerous American companies, helping them adjust to foreign specifications. It provides guidance and marketing data as well. The Office of Export Enforcement administers export controls, especially regarding the spread of nuclear technology and highly advanced electronic technology. Under the administration of President Donald Trump, the policy has been to restrict high-technology flows to China. From 1949 to 1994, the department worked with the 17-nation Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, which restricted technological flows to the Soviet Union and other communist nations. Since 1980, the Commerce Department works to neutralize the dumping of exports or the subsidies of overseas production. Along with the export controls, this work continues to generate friction with other nations. On July 20, 2020, the commerce department announced adding eleven Chinese firms to an export blacklist for committing human rights abuse against Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang by conducting genetic analysis on them. Two of the firms sanctioned were subsidiaries of BGI Group, a Chinese genetic sequencing, and biomedical firm. In the same year October, the BGI Group firm was again named in the alleged exploitation of medical samples of patients testing for Covid-19 in Nevada using the 200,000 rapid testing kits donated by the United Arab Emirates under its AI and cloud computing firm, Group 42. The Emirati firm, also known as G42, has previously been named in the mass surveillance of people via an instant messaging application called ToTok, which was actually a spy application snooping on user data.

==Organization==

===Facilities===
From its establishment until 1932, the Department of Commerce was headquartered in the Willard Building. In 1932, following completion of construction of the Herbert Hoover Building, the department relocated to the new facility, where it remains as of 2025.

===Leadership===
The department is headed by the Secretary of Commerce, a member of the president&#x27;s cabinet and the tenth in line to succession to the U.S. presidency. In the event of the death, resignation, vacancy, or incapacity of the secretary, the following officials succeed to the office of secretary on an acting basis until the president appoints another person as acting secretary, or the vacancy is remedied through a permanent appointment by the president with the advice and consent of the United States Senate:

#Deputy Secretary of Commerce
#General Counsel of the Department of Commerce
#Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade
#Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs
#Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology
#Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere
#Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration
#Chief Financial Officer of the Department of Commerce
#Site Manager of the NIST Boulder Laboratories

==Reorganization proposals==
Proposals to reorganize the department go back many decades. The Department of Commerce was one of three departments that Texas governor Rick Perry advocated eliminating during his 2012 presidential campaign, along with the Department of Education and Department of Energy. Perry&#x27;s campaign cited the frequency with which agencies had historically been moved into and out of the department and its lack of a coherent focus, and advocated moving its vital programs into other departments such as the Department of the Interior, Department of Labor, and Department of the Treasury. The Economic Development Administration would be completely eliminated.

On January 13, 2012, President Barack Obama announced his intentions to ask the United States Congress for the power to close the department and replace it with a new cabinet-level agency focused on trade and exports. The new agency would include the Office of the United States Trade Representative, currently part of the Executive Office of the President, as well as the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the United States Trade and Development Agency, and the Small Business Administration, which are all currently independent agencies. The Obama administration projected that the reorganization would save $3 billion and would help the administration&#x27;s goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years. The new agency would be organized around four &quot;pillars&quot;: a technology and innovation office including the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the National Institute of Standards and Technology; a statistical division including the United States Census Bureau and other data-collection agencies currently in the Commerce Department, and also the Bureau of Labor Statistics which would be transferred from the Department of Labor; a trade and investment policy office; and a small business development office. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) would be transferred from the Department of Commerce into the Department of the Interior. Later that year, shortly before the 2012 presidential election, Obama invoked the idea of a &quot;secretary of business&quot; in reference to the plan. The reorganization was part of a larger proposal which would grant the president the authority to propose mergers of federal agencies, which would then be subject to an up-or-down Congressional vote. This ability had existed from the Great Depression until the Reagan presidency, when Congress rescinded the authority.

The Obama administration plan faced criticism for some of its elements. Some Congress members expressed concern that the Office of the United States Trade Representative would lose focus if it were included in a larger bureaucracy, especially given its status as an &quot;honest broker&quot; between other agencies, which tend to advocate for specific points of view. The overall plan has also been criticized as an attempt to create an agency similar to Japan&#x27;s powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which was abolished in 2001 after some of its initiatives failed and it became seen as a hindrance to growth. NOAA&#x27;s climate and terrestrial operations and fisheries and endangered species programs would be expected to integrate well with agencies already in the Interior Department, such as the United States Geological Survey and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. However, environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council feared that the reorganization could distract the agency from its mission of protecting the nation&#x27;s oceans and ecosystems. The plan was reiterated in the Obama administration&#x27;s FY2016 budget proposal that was released in February 2015.

The main focus of the bureau is the security of the United States, which includes its national security, economic security, cyber security, and homeland security. For example, in the area of dual-use export controls, BIS administers and enforces such controls to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them, to halt the spread of weapons to terrorists or countries of concern, and to further U.S. foreign policy objectives. Where there is credible evidence suggesting that the export of a dual-use item threatens U.S. security, the Bureau is empowered to prevent export of the item.

In addition to national security, BIS&#x27;s function is to ensure the health of the U.S. economy and the competitiveness of U.S. industry. BIS promotes a strong defense–industrial base that can develop and provide technologies that will enable the United States to maintain its military superiority. BIS takes care to ensure that its regulations do not impose unreasonable restrictions on legitimate international commercial activity that are necessary for the health of U.S. industry.

==Lists of Parties of Concern==
The Bureau maintains five major lists of parties with whom exportation is forbidden or requires licensing. The five lists are:

The Consolidated Screening List is a searchable database maintained under a collaboration of the Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury, to aid individuals and industries which may be engaged in overseas trade to determine whether transactions involving specific persons or items are legal, or whether licensure or special records are required.

The Entity List, which is regularly updated on both the BIS website and the Federal Register.

The Military End User List, published as a supplement to the Export Administration Regulations Section 744.

The Denied Persons List

The Unverified List

<doc id="70250" wikidata="Q51541" url="?curid=70250" title="Nicolas Roeg">
<text>Nicolas Jack Roeg ( ; 15 August 1928 – 23 November 2018) was an English film director and cinematographer, best known for directing &quot;Performance&quot; (1970), &quot;Walkabout&quot; (1971), &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; (1973), &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; (1976), &quot;Bad Timing&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Witches&quot; (1990).

Making his directorial debut 23 years after his entry into the film business, Roeg quickly became known for an idiosyncratic visual and narrative style, characterised by the use of disjointed and disorienting editing. For this reason, he is considered a highly influential filmmaker, cited as an inspiration by such directors as Steven Soderbergh, Christopher Nolan and Danny Boyle.

In 1999, the British Film Institute acknowledged Roeg&#x27;s importance in the British film industry by naming &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; and &quot;Performance&quot; the 8th- and 48th-greatest British films of all time in its Top 100 British films poll.

==Early life==
Roeg was born in St John&#x27;s Wood in North London on 15 August 1928 to Jack Nicolas Roeg and Mabel Gertrude (née Silk). He had an older sister, Nicolette (1925–1987), who was an actress. His father, of Dutch origin, achieved considerable success in the diamond trade, until a failed South African investment saw him suffer heavy financial losses. Of his initial attraction to the film industry, Roeg suggested it was sparked by a recording studio located opposite his home. Roeg was educated at the Mercers&#x27; School in London.

==Career==
===Cinematography===
In 1947, after completing national service in the British Army as a unit projectionist, Roeg entered the film business as a tea boy, moving up to clapper-loader, the bottom rung of the camera department, at Marylebone Studios in London. For a time, he worked as a camera operator on a number of film productions, including &quot;The Sundowners&quot; and &quot;The Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot;.

Roeg was a second-unit cinematographer on David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962) and this led to Lean&#x27;s hiring Roeg as cinematographer on his next film, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965); Roeg&#x27;s creative vision clashed with that of Lean and eventually he was fired from the production and replaced by Freddie Young, who received sole credit for cinematography when the film was released in 1965. He was credited as cinematographer on Roger Corman&#x27;s &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; and François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, as well as John Schlesinger&#x27;s &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; and Richard Lester&#x27;s &quot;Petulia&quot;; the latter is the last film on which Roeg was solely credited for cinematography and also shares many characteristics and similarities with Roeg&#x27;s work as a director.

===Directing===
In the late 1960s, Roeg moved into directing with &quot;Performance&quot;, alongside Donald Cammell. The film centres on an aspiring London gangster (James Fox) who moves in with a reclusive rock star (Mick Jagger) to evade his bosses. The film featured cinematography by Roeg and a screenplay by Cammell, the latter of whom had favoured Marlon Brando for the James Fox role. The film was completed in 1968 but withheld from release by its distributor Warner Bros. who, according to Sanford Lieberson, &quot;didn&#x27;t think it was releasable.&quot; The film was eventually released with an X rating in 1970 and, despite its initial poor reception, has come to be held in high esteem by critics due to its cult following.

Roeg followed up with &quot;Walkabout&quot;, which tells the story of an English teenage girl and her younger brother who are abandoned in the Australian Outback by their father after his suicide and forced to fend for themselves, with the help of an Aboriginal boy on his walkabout. Roeg cast Jenny Agutter in the role of the girl, his son Luc as the boy, and David Gulpilil as the Aboriginal boy. It was widely praised by critics despite its lack of commercial success.

Roeg&#x27;s next film, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;, is based on Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s short story of the same name and starred Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland as a married couple in Venice mourning the death of their daughter who had drowned. It attracted scrutiny early on due to a sex scene between Sutherland and Christie, which was unusually explicit for the time. Roeg&#x27;s decision to inter-cut the sexual intercourse with shots of the couple dressing afterwards was reportedly due to the need to assuage the fears of the censors and there were rumours at the time of its release that the sex was unsimulated. The film was widely praised by critics and considered one of the most important and influential horror films ever made.

Similarly to &quot;Performance&quot;, Roeg cast musicians in leading roles for his next two films, &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; and &quot;Bad Timing&quot;. &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; (1976) stars David Bowie as a humanoid alien who comes to Earth to collect water for his planet, which is suffering from a drought. The film divided critics and was truncated upon its U.S. release. Despite this, it was entered into the Berlin International Film Festival where Roeg was nominated for the Golden Bear. It is today considered an important science fiction film and is one of Roeg&#x27;s most celebrated films. &quot;Bad Timing&quot; was released in 1980 and stars Art Garfunkel as an American psychiatrist living in Vienna who develops a love affair with a fellow expatriate (played by Theresa Russell, to whom Roeg was later married), which culminates in the latter being rushed to hospital due to an incident the nature of which is revealed over the course of the film. At first, it was disliked by critics, as well as by the Rank Organisation, its distributor, who allegedly described it as &quot;a sick film made by sick people for sick people.&quot; Rank requested that their logo be taken off the finished film.

&quot;Bad Timing&quot; marked the beginning of a three-film partnership with Jeremy Thomas. The second of these films &quot;Eureka&quot; (1983) is loosely based on the true story of Sir Harry Oakes; it received a largely limited release both theatrically and on home video. It was followed up with &quot;Insignificance&quot;, which imagines a meeting between Marilyn Monroe, Albert Einstein, Monroe&#x27;s second husband Joe DiMaggio and Senator Joseph McCarthy. &quot;Insignificance&quot; was screened in competition at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival, with the film being selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or.

In 1986, Roeg was approached by then Secretary of State for Health and Social Services Norman Fowler and the advertising agency TBWA to direct the British government&#x27;s public health campaign &quot;&quot;.

Roeg&#x27;s next two films, &quot;Castaway&quot; and &quot;Track 29&quot;, are considered minor entries in his oeuvre. Roeg was selected to direct an adaptation of Roald Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Witches&quot; by Jim Henson, who had procured the film rights to the book in 1983. This would prove to be his last major studio film and proved a great success with critics, although it was a box-office failure. Roeg made only three theatrical films following &quot;The Witches&quot;: &quot;Cold Heaven&quot; (1992), &quot;Two Deaths&quot; (1995) and &quot;Puffball&quot; (2007). Roeg also did a small amount of work for television, including &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;, an adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play, and &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and an episode of George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot;.

Roeg did not make any more films after 2007, but published a memoir, &quot;The World Is Ever Changing&quot;, in 2013.

Roeg&#x27;s films are known for having scenes and images from the plot presented in a disarranged fashion, out of chronological and causal order, requiring the viewer to do the work of mentally rearranging them to comprehend the story line. They seem to &quot;shatter reality into a thousand pieces&quot; and are &quot;unpredictable, fascinating, cryptic, and liable to leave you wondering what the hell just happened...&quot; This is also the strategy of Richard Lester&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;Petulia&quot;, which was Roeg&#x27;s last film as a cinematographer only. A characteristic of Roeg&#x27;s films is that they are edited in disjunctive and semi-coherent ways that make full sense only in the film&#x27;s final moments, when a crucial piece of information surfaces; they are &quot;mosaic-like montages [filled with] elliptical details which become very important later.&quot;

These techniques, along with Roeg&#x27;s foreboding sense of atmosphere, influenced later such filmmakers as Steven Soderbergh, Tony Scott, Ridley Scott, François Ozon and Danny Boyle. In addition to this, Christopher Nolan has said his film &quot;Memento&quot; would have been &quot;pretty unthinkable&quot; without Roeg and cites the finale of &quot;Insignificance&quot; as an influence on his own &quot;Inception&quot;. In addition to this, Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Out of Sight&quot; features a love scene that is visibly influenced by that in &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;.

A further theme that can be seen to be running through Roeg&#x27;s filmography is characters who are out of their natural setting. Examples of this include the schoolchildren in the Outback in &quot;Walkabout&quot;, the men and women in Venice in &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;, the alien on Earth in &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, and the Americans in Vienna in &quot;Bad Timing&quot;.

Roeg&#x27;s influence on cinema is not limited to deconstructing narrative. The &quot;Memo from Turner&quot; sequence in &quot;Performance&quot; predates many techniques later used in music videos. The &quot;quadrant&quot; sequence in &quot;Bad Timing&quot;, in which the thoughts of Theresa Russell and Art Garfunkel are heard before words are spoken set to Keith Jarrett&#x27;s piano music from &quot;The Köln Concert&quot;, stretched the boundaries of what could be done with film.

==Legacy and honours==
Roeg&#x27;s cinematic work was showcased at the Riverside Studios from 12–14 September 2008. He introduced the retrospective with Miranda Richardson, who starred in &quot;Puffball&quot;. The programme included &quot;Bad Timing&quot;, &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, &quot;The Witches&quot;, &quot;Eureka&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; and &quot;Insignificance&quot;. The London Film Academy organised this event for Roeg in honour of his patronage of the school.

In 1994, he was awarded a British Film Institute Fellowship. In the 1996 New Year Honours, Roeg was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

==Personal life and death==
From 1957 to 1977, Roeg was married to English actress Susan Stephen. They had four sons: Waldo, Nico, Sholto and (film producer) Luc Roeg. Luc appeared as an actor, as Lucien John, in &quot;Walkabout&quot;, Roeg&#x27;s first film as solo director. In 1982, Roeg married American actress Theresa Russell and they had two sons: Maximillian (an actor) and Statten Roeg. They later divorced. Roeg was then married to Harriet Harper from 2005 until his death, from dementia, on 23 November 2018, at a nursing home in Ladbroke Grove, London.

Actor Donald Sutherland (who named one of his sons after Roeg) described Roeg as a &quot;fearless visionary&quot;. Filmmaker Duncan Jones, the son of David Bowie, who starred in &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; (1976), also paid tribute to Roeg, calling him a &quot;great storyteller&quot; and &quot;inimitable&quot;.

<doc id="70257" wikidata="Q827032" url="?curid=70257" title="Growth accounting">
<text>Growth accounting is a procedure used in economics to measure the contribution of different factors to economic growth and to indirectly compute the rate of technological progress, measured as a residual, in an economy. Growth accounting decomposes the growth rate of an economy&#x27;s total output into that which is due to increases in the contributing amount of the factors used—usually the increase in the amount of capital and labor—and that which cannot be accounted for by observable changes in factor utilization. The unexplained part of growth in GDP is then taken to represent increases in productivity (getting more output with the same amounts of inputs) or a measure of broadly defined technological progress.

The technique has been applied to virtually every economy in the world and a common finding is that observed levels of economic growth cannot be explained simply by changes in the stock of capital in the economy or population and labor force growth rates. Hence, technological progress plays a key role in the economic growth of nations, or the lack of it.

== History ==

This methodology was introduced by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan in 1957. Growth accounting was proposed for management accounting in the 1980s. but they did not gain on as management tools. The reason is clear. The production functions are understood and formulated differently in growth accounting and management accounting. In growth accounting the production function is formulated as a function OUTPUT=F (INPUT), which formulation leads to maximize the average productivity ratio OUTPUT/INPUT. Average productivity has never been accepted in management accounting (in business) as a performance criterion or an objective to be maximized because it would mean the end of the profitable business. Instead the production function is formulated as a function INCOME=F(OUTPUT-INPUT) which is to be maximized. The name of the game is to maximize income, not to maximize productivity or production.

== Abstract example==

The growth accounting model is normally expressed in the form of the exponential growth function. As an abstract example consider an economy whose total output (GDP) grows at 3% per year. Over the same period its capital stock grows at 6% per year and its labor force by 1%. The contribution of the growth rate of capital to output is equal to that growth rate weighted by the share of capital in total output and the contribution of labor is given by the growth rate of labor weighted by labor&#x27;s share in income. If capital&#x27;s share in output is , then labor&#x27;s share is (assuming these are the only two factors of production). This means that the portion of growth in output which is due to changes in factors is .06×()+.01×()=.027 or 2.7%. This means that there is still 0.3% of the growth in output that cannot be accounted for. This remainder is the increase in the productivity of factors that happened over the period, or the measure of technological progress during this time.

== Specific example ==
Growth accounting can also be expressed in the form of the arithmetical model, which is used here because it is more descriptive and understandable. The principle of the accounting model is simple. The weighted growth rates of inputs (factors of production) are subtracted from the weighted growth rates of outputs. Because the accounting result is obtained by subtracting it is often called a &quot;residual&quot;. The residual is often defined as the growth rate of output not explained by the share-weighted growth rates of the inputs.

We can use the real process data of the production model in order to show the logic of the growth accounting model and identify possible differences in relation to the productivity model. When the production data is the same in the model comparison the differences in the accounting results are only due to accounting models. We get the following growth accounting from the production data.

The growth accounting procedure proceeds as follows. First is calculated the growth rates for the output and the inputs by dividing the Period 2 numbers with the Period 1 numbers. Then the weights of inputs are computed as input shares of the total input (Period 1). Weighted growth rates (WG) are obtained by weighting growth rates with the weights. The accounting result is obtained by subtracting the weighted growth rates of the inputs from the growth rate of the output. In this case the accounting result is 0.015 which implies a productivity growth by 1.5%.

We note that the productivity model reports a 1.4% productivity growth from the same production data. The difference (1.4% versus 1.5%) is caused by the different production volume used in the models. In the productivity model the input volume is used as a production volume measure giving the growth rate 1.063. In this case productivity is defined as follows: output volume per one unit of input volume. In the growth accounting model the output volume is used as a production volume measure giving the growth rate 1.078. In this case productivity is defined as follows: input consumption per one unit of output volume. The case can be verified easily with the aid of productivity model using output as a production volume.

The accounting result of the growth accounting model is expressed as an index number, in this example 1.015, which depicts the average productivity change. As demonstrated above we cannot draw correct conclusions based on average productivity numbers. This is due to the fact that productivity is accounted as an independent variable separated from the entity it belongs to, i.e. real income formation. Hence, if we compare in a practical situation two growth accounting results of the same production process we do not know which one is better in terms of production performance. We have to know separately income effects of productivity change and production volume change or their combined income effect in order to understand which one result is better and how much better.

This kind of scientific mistake of wrong analysis level has been recognized and described long ago. Vygotsky cautions against the risk of separating the issue under review from the total environment, the entity of which the issue is an essential part. By studying only this isolated issue we are likely to end up with incorrect conclusions. A second practical example illustrates this warning. Let us assume we are studying the properties of water in putting out a fire. If we focus the review on small components of the whole, in this case the elements oxygen and hydrogen, we come to the conclusion that hydrogen is an explosive gas and oxygen is a catalyst in combustion. Therefore, their compound water could be explosive and unsuitable for putting out a fire. This incorrect conclusion arises from the fact that the components have been separated from the entity.

==Technical derivation==

The total output of an economy is modeled as being produced by various factors of production, with capital and labor being the primary ones in modern economies (although land and natural resources can also be included). This is usually captured by an aggregate production function:

formula_1

where Y is total output, K is the stock of capital in the economy, L is the labor force (or population) and A is a &quot;catch all&quot; factor for technology, role of institutions and other relevant forces which measures how productively capital and labor are used in production.

Standard assumptions on the form of the function F(.) is that it is increasing in K, L, A (if you increase productivity or you increase the number of factors used you get more output) and that it is homogeneous of degree one, or in other words that there are constant returns to scale (which means that if you double both K and L you get double the output). The assumption of constant returns to scale facilitates the assumption of perfect competition which in turn implies that factors get their marginal products:

formula_2

formula_3

where MPK denotes the extra units of output produced with an additional unit of capital and similarly, for MPL. Wages paid to labor are denoted by w and the rate of profit or the real interest rate is denoted by r. Note that the assumption of perfect competition enables us to take prices as given. For simplicity we assume unit price (i.e. P =1), and thus quantities also represent values in all equations.

If we totally differentiate the above production function we get;

formula_4

where formula_5 denotes the partial derivative with respect to factor i, or for the case of capital and labor, the marginal products. With perfect competition this equation becomes:

formula_6

If we divide through by Y and convert each change into growth rates we get:

formula_7

or denoting a growth rate (percentage change over time) of a factor as formula_8 we get:

formula_9

Then formula_10 is the share of total income that goes to capital, which can be denoted as formula_11 and formula_12 is the share of total income that goes to labor, denoted by formula_13. This allows us to express the above equation as:

formula_14

In principle the terms formula_11, formula_16, formula_17 and formula_18 are all observable and can be measured using standard national income accounting methods (with capital stock being measured using investment rates via the perpetual inventory method). The term formula_19 however is not directly observable as it captures technological growth and improvement in productivity that are unrelated to changes in use of factors. This term is usually referred to as Solow residual or Total factor productivity growth. Slightly rearranging the previous equation we can measure this as that portion of increase in total output which is not due to the (weighted) growth of factor inputs:

formula_20

Another way to express the same idea is in per capita (or per worker) terms in which we subtract off the growth rate of labor force from both sides:

formula_21

which states that the rate of technological growth is that part of the growth rate of per capita income which is not due to the (weighted) growth rate of capital per person.

<text>I, the Jury is the 1947 debut novel of American crime fiction writer Mickey Spillane, the first work to feature private investigator Mike Hammer.

==Plot summary==
Private detective Mike Hammer is called to the apartment of insurance investigator Jack Williams, a close friend who was crippled saving Hammer&#x27;s life during shared World War II military service in the Pacific. Losing his arm rendered Jack unfit for police work, so he put his experience to use by investigating insurance fraud. Williams has been murdered in a particularly cruel way, deliberately shot in the stomach to make the death slow and painful. Mike vows vengeance, declaring that Jack&#x27;s murderer will die the same way Jack did.

Prior to his death, Jack had fallen in love with Myrna Devlin when he stopped her from committing suicide by jumping from a bridge. Williams asked Dr. Charlotte Manning, a young, beautiful, blonde, and well-to-do psychiatrist, to admit Myrna to her clinic for psychotherapy. After Myrna became clean, she and Williams became engaged. The couple maintained a casual friendship with Manning. Over time, Williams comes to suspect that Hal Kines, one of Manning&#x27;s college students who has spent some time at her clinic and who has become one of her casual acquaintances, is in fact a criminal.

In the course of his investigation, Hammer meets and begins to fall in love with Dr. Manning. In the course of the novel, they become engaged.

Taking time out from his investigation on a Saturday morning, Hammer picks up Myrna Devlin and gives her a lift to an estate in the country, owned by the lovely Bellamy twins, for a gigantic all-day party. Charlotte Manning says she has some business to attend to and will be there in time for a tennis game due to take place that evening. After an unsuccessful attempt at playing tennis himself, Hammer gets rid of his sleep deficit by spending all day in his room, fast asleep, with &quot;old junior&quot; — his gun — close to him. He is woken up just in time for dinner, during which Harmon Wilder, the Bellamys&#x27; lawyer, and Charles Sherman, Wilder&#x27;s assistant, are pointed out to him. This is a fine — and the final — distractor in the novel: Wilder and Sherman are suddenly missing from the party after Myrna Devlin has been found shot. In fact they had illicit drugs on them and did not want to be found out. During the tennis game, Mary Bellamy asks Charlotte if she can &quot;borrow&quot; Hammer. She then leads him into the woods, where they have sex. They return to the party just as a maid discovers Myrna&#x27;s body in an upstairs room, in front of a large mirror. Both Hammer&#x27;s friend Pat Chambers and other police are called in, and the alibi of each guest is checked.

Now having another reason to seek vengeance, Hammer redoubles his efforts to discover the killer. Soon he has uncovered a wide-ranging narcotics rings, one that Jack had been on the verge of exposing.

Back home, Hammer retreats into his apartment to think. Finally, he knows the identity of the killer: Dr. Manning. Confronting her, Hammer keeps his promise and kills her in the same excruciatingly painful way she had killed his friend Jack.

When the dying murderer asks Hammer how he could act in such a cruel manner, Hammer replies &quot;It was easy!&quot;.

==Reception==
By the time the book was adapted into a film in 1953, it had sold 3,500,000 copies.

== Films ==

The first film version of &quot;I, the Jury&quot; was shot in 1953 and was released through United Artists. After a four-picture contract was signed with Spillane, the movie was filmed, in 3-D, featuring Biff Elliot (as Mike Hammer), Preston Foster and Peggie Castle. The plot from the novel was toned down for the film version. It grossed $1,299,000. The cinematographer was John Alton.

In 1982, the story was again made into a movie, this time with Richard T. Heffron directing, and with Armand Assante as Mike Hammer.

== In popular culture ==
The novel&#x27;s reputation for raciness and violence has outlasted the popularity of the book itself.
* The book was featured in &quot;Dino Checks Out&quot;, an episode of the Nickelodeon cartoon &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; The book was given to Arnold within a box of personal mementos; however, Arnold&#x27;s grandfather takes it, saying &quot;I&#x27;ll just hold on to this until you&#x27;re 10.&quot;
* The novel is mentioned in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Profit and Loss&quot;.
* In &quot;All The Way&quot;, the first episode of the television sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot; (set in the 1950s), Potsie Weber gives Richie Cunningham a copy of the book to study before his date with a girl with &quot;a reputation&quot;.
* In &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode number 208 (in season 9), &quot;Operation Friendship&quot;, a wounded Maxwell Klinger asks Charles Winchester to read him the novel.
* The Rush song &quot;Show Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; references the book&#x27;s title in the second verse.
* In Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;It&quot;, Derry policeman Aloysius Nell is reading the novel as he rides in the ambulance with Eddie Kaspbrak.
* In Larry McMurtry&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, the novel is mentioned as being &quot;a book the local drugstore could never keep in stock&quot;. In the film adaptation of the novel, the two main characters secretly pass the book between them during class.
* In Judy Blume&#x27;s novel &quot;In the Unlikely Event&quot;, Ruby is reading the book as she is waiting in the airport.

<text>Castile and León is an autonomous community in northwestern Spain. Castile and León is the largest autonomous community in Spain by area, covering 94,222 km2. It is, however, sparsely populated, with a population density below 30/km2. While a capital has not been explicitly declared, the seats of the executive and legislative powers are set in Valladolid by law, and for all purposes that city (also the most populated municipality) serves as the &quot;de facto&quot; regional capital.

Castile and León is a landlocked region, bordered by Portugal as well as by the Spanish autonomous communities of Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque Country, La Rioja, Aragon, Castilla–La Mancha, the Community of Madrid and Extremadura. Chiefly comprising the northern half of the Inner Plateau, it is surrounded by mountain barriers (the Cantabrian Mountains to the North, the Sistema Central to the South and the Sistema Ibérico to the East) and most of the territory is drained by the Douro River (Spanish: &quot;Duero&quot;), flowing west toward the Atlantic Ocean.

The autonomous community was created in 1983 by grouping the provinces of León, Zamora, Salamanca (all three traditionally attached to the region of León), Ávila, Burgos, Palencia, Segovia, Soria and Valladolid (attached to Old Castile). 

The region contains eleven World Heritage Sites, making it (along with Lombardia in Italy) the region with most UNESCO World Heritage Sites. UNESCO recognizes the Cortes of León of 1188 as the cradle of worldwide parliamentarism. The region is strongly affected by population ageing.


==Symbols==

The Statute of Autonomy of Castile and León, reformed most recently in 2007, establishes in the sixth article of its preliminary title the symbols of the community&#x27;s exclusive identity. These are: the coat of arms, the flag, the banner and the anthem. Its legal protection is the same as that corresponding to the symbols of the State -whose outrages are classified as crime in article 543 of the Penal Code-.

In the articulated statuary, the coat of arms is defined as follows:
Likewise, the flag is described as follows:
Following the same wording, the banner is constituted by the shield quartered on a traditional crimson background. The Statute also expresses: &quot;The anthem and the other symbols [...] will be regulated by specific law&quot;. After the promulgation of the fundamental norm, this law was not promulgated, so the anthem does not exist, but &quot;de iure&quot; is a symbol of autonomy.

==History==

Several archaeological findings show that in prehistoric times these lands were already inhabited. In the Atapuerca Mountains have been found many bones of the ancestors of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, making these findings one of the most important to determine the history of human evolution. The most important discovery that catapulted the site to international fame was the remains of &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;.

Before the arrival of the Romans, it is known that the territories that make up Castile and León today were occupied by various Celtic peoples, such as Vaccaei, Autrigones, Turmodigi, the Vettones, Astures or Celtiberians. The Roman conquest resulted in warring with the local tribes. One particularly famous episode was the siege of Numantia, an old town located near the current city of Soria.

The romanization was unstoppable, and to this day great Roman works of art have remained, mainly the Aqueduct of Segovia as well as many archaeological remains such as those of the ancient Clunia, Salt mines of Poza de la Sal and the vía de la Plata pathway, which crosses the west of the community from Astorga (&quot;Asturica Augusta&quot;) to the capital of modern Extremadura, Mérida (&quot;Emerita Augusta&quot;).
With the fall of Rome, the lands were occupied militarily by the Visigoth peoples of Germanic origin. The subsequent arrival of the Arabs was followed by a process known as the &quot;Reconquista&quot; (Reconquest). In the mountainous area of Asturias, a small Christian kingdom was created that opposed the Islamic presence in the Peninsula. It proclaimed itself an heir of the last Visigoth kings, who in turn had been deeply romanized. This resistance of Visigoth-Roman heritage, supported by Christianity, was becoming increasingly strong and expanding to the south, eventually establishing its court in the city of León, becoming the Kingdom of León. To encourage the repopulation of the newly reconquered lands, a number of fueros (&quot;letters of repopulation&quot;) were granted by the monarchs.
In the Middle Ages, Christian pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostela were popularized. The Camino de Santiago, running along the northern part of the region, was a major part of the route of pilgrimage, so it contributed to the spread of European cultural innovations throughout the peninsula. Today the Camino is still an important touristic and cultural attraction.

In 1188, the basilica of San Isidoro of León was the setting of the first parliamentary body in the history of Europe, with the participation of the Third Estate. The king who summoned it was Alfonso IX of León.

The legal basis for the kingdom was the Roman law, and because of this the kings increasingly wanted more power, like the Roman emperors. This is very clearly seen in the &quot;Siete Partidas&quot; of Alfonso X of Castile, which shows the imperial monism that the king sought. The King did not want to be a &quot;primus inter pares&quot;, but the source of the law.
Simultaneously, a county of this Christian kingdom of León, began to acquire autonomy and to expand. This is the primitive County of Castile, which would grow into a powerful kingdom among the Christian kingdoms of the Peninsula. The first Castilian count was Fernán González.
León and Castile continued to expand to the South, even beyond the Douro river, seeking to conquest lands under Islamic rule. That was the time of the &quot;Cantares de gesta&quot;, poems which recount the great deeds of the Christian nobles who fought against the Muslim enemy. Despite this, Christian and Muslim kings maintained diplomatic relations. One clear example is Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, &quot;El Cid&quot;, paradigm of the medieval Christian knight, who fought both for Christian and Muslim kings.

The origin of the definitive dynastic unification of the kingdoms of Castile and León, which had been separated for just seven decades, was in 1194. Alfonso VIII of Castile and Alfonso IX of León signed in Tordehumos the treaty that pacified the area of Tierra de Campos and laid the foundation for a future reunification of the kingdoms, consolidated in 1230 with Ferdinand III &quot;the Saint&quot;. This agreement is called the Treaty of Tordehumos.

During the Late Middle Ages there was an economic and political crisis produced by a series of bad harvests and by disputes between nobles and the Crown for power, as well as between different contenders for the throne. In the Cortes of Valladolid of 1295, Ferdinand IV is recognized as king. The painting María de Molina presents her son Fernando IV in the Cortes of Valladolid of 1295 presides today the Spanish Congress of Deputies along with a painting of the Cortes of Cádiz, emphasizing the parliamentarian importance that has all the development of Cortes in Castile and León, despite its subsequent decline. The Crown was becoming more authoritarian and the nobility more dependent on it.

The &quot;Reconquista&quot; continued advancing from the thriving Crown of Castile to the south, and culminated with the Granada War against the last Muslim stronghold in the Iberian peninsula, the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, which surrendered on 2 January 1492.


===Antecedents of the autonomy===
In June 1978, Castile and León obtained the pre-autonomy, through the creation of General council of Castile and León by Royal Decree-Law 20/1978, of 13 June.

In times of the First Spanish Republic (1873–1874), the federal republicans conceived the project to create a federated state of eleven provinces in the valley of the Spanish Douro, that would also have included the provinces of Santander and Logroño. Very few years before, in 1869, as part of a manifesto, federal republicans representatives of the 17 provinces of Albacete, Ávila, Burgos, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara, León, Logroño, Madrid, Palencia, Salamanca, Santander, Segovia, Soria, Toledo, Valladolid and Zamora proposed in the so-called Castilian Federal Pact the conformation of an entity formed by two different &quot;states&quot;: the state of Old Castile -that is presently built for the current Castilian-Leonese provinces and the provinces of Logroño and Santander-, and the state of New Castile -which conforms to the current provinces of Castile-La Mancha plus the province of Madrid-. The end of the Republic, at the beginning of 1874, thwarted the initiative.
In 1921, on the occasion of the fourth centenary of the Battle of Villalar, the Santander City Council advocated the creation of a Castilian and Leonese Commonwealth of eleven provinces, an idea that would be maintained in later years. At the end of 1931 and beginning of 1932, from León, Eugenio Merino elaborated a text in which the base of a Castilian-Leonese regionalism was put. The text was published in the Diario de León newspaper.

During the Second Spanish Republic, especially in 1936, there was a great regionalist activity favorable to a region of eleven provinces, and even bases for the Statute of Autonomy were elaborated. The &quot;Diario de León&quot; advocated for the formalization of this initiative and the constitution of an autonomous region with these words:

The end of the Spanish Civil War and the beginning of Franco regime ended the aspirations of the autonomy for the region. The philosopher José Ortega y Gasset collected this scheme in his publications.

After the death of Francisco Franco, regionalist, autonomist and nationalist organizations (Castilian-Leonese regionalism and Castilian nationalism) as Regional Alliance of Castile and León (1975), Regional Institute of Castile and León (1976) or the Autonomous Nationalist Party of Castile and León (1977). Later after the extinction of these formations arose in 1993 Regionalist Unity of Castile and León.

At the same time, others of Leonesist character arose, such as the Leonese Autonomous Group (1978) or Regionalist Party of the Leonese Country (1980), which advocated the creation of a Leonese autonomous community, composed of provinces of León, Salamanca and Zamora. The popular and political support that maintained the uniprovincial autonomy in León became very important in that city.

===Autonomy===
The autonomous community of Castile and León is the result of the union in 1983 of nine provinces: the three that, after the territorial division of 1833, by which the provinces were created, were ascribed to the Region of León, and six ascribed to Old Castile; however 2 provinces of Old Castile were not included: Santander (current community of Cantabria) and Logroño (current La Rioja).
In the case of Cantabria the creation of an autonomous community was advocated for historical, cultural and geographical reasons, while in La Rioja the process was more complex due to the existence of three alternatives, all based on historical and socio-economic reasons: union with Castile and León (advocated by the Union of the Democratic Centre political party), union to a Basque-Navarrese community (supported by the Socialist Party and Communist Party) or creation of an uniprovincial autonomy; the latter option was chosen because it had more support among the population.

After the creation of the Castilian-Leonese pre-autonomous body, which was supported by the Provincial Council of León in its agreement of April 16, 1980, this institution revoked its original agreement on January 13, 1983, just as the draft of the Organic Law entered the Spanish parliament. The Constitutional Court determined which of those contradictory agreements was valid in the &quot;Sentence 89/1984 of September 28&quot;; it declares that the subject of the process is no longer, as in its preliminary phase, the councils and municipalities, but the new body.

After the sentence, there were several demonstrations in León in favor of the &quot;León alone&quot; option (see Leonesism), one of them according to some sources brought together a number close to 90 000 people, This was the highest concentration held in the city in the Democratic period until the demonstrations rejecting the 2004 Madrid train bombings.

In an agreement adopted on 31 July 1981, the Provincial Council of Segovia decided to exercise the initiative so that Segovia could be constituted as a uniprovincial autonomous community, but in the municipalities of the province the situation was equal between the supporters of the uniprovincial autonomy and the supporters of the union.
The City Council of Cuéllar initially adhered to this autonomic initiative in agreement adopted by the corporation on October 5, 1981. However, another agreement adopted by the same corporation dated December 3 of the same year revoked the previous one and the process was paralyzed pending the processing of an appeal filed by the provincial council against this last agreement; this change of opinion of the city council of Cuéllar tipped the scales in the province towards the autonomy with the rest of Castile and León, but it was an agreement that arrived out of time. Finally the province of Segovia was incorporated into Castile and León along with the other eight provinces and legal coverage was given through the &quot;Organic Law 5/1983&quot; for &quot;reasons of national interest&quot;, as provided for in article 144 c of the Spanish Constitution for those provinces that have not exercised their right on time.

Since 2019, the &quot;ayuntamientos&quot; of several municipalities of the province of León (including the capital&#x27;s) have passed motions to propose the split of the provinces of the region of León from Castile and León and become a standalone autonomous community. As leonesism has traditionally been a fringe movement in the provinces of Zamora and Salamanca, some of these motions have limited to the prospect of a single-province autonomous community exclusively for León (&quot;).

==Geography==
===Location===
Castile and León is a landlocked autonomous community, located in the north-western quadrant of the Iberian Peninsula. Its territory borders on the north with the uniprovincial communities of Asturias and Cantabria, as well as with the Basque Country (Biscay and Álava); to the east with the uniprovincial community of La Rioja and with Aragon (province of Zaragoza), to the south with the Community of Madrid, Castile-La Mancha (provinces of Toledo and Guadalajara) and Extremadura (province of Cáceres) and to the west with Galicia (provinces of Lugo and Ourense) and Portugal (Bragança District and Guarda District).

===Orography===
The morphology of Castile and León consists, for the most part, of the northern half of the Meseta Central (&quot;Meseta Norte&quot;) and a belt of mountainous reliefs. The Meseta Central is a high plateau with an average altitude close to above sea-level; it is covered by deposited clay materials that have given rise to a dry and arid landscape.

===Geology===
The Northern Plateau (Meseta Norte) is constituted by Paleozoic sockets. At the beginning of the Mesozoic Era, once the Hercynian folding that raised the current Central Europe and the Gallaeci zone of Spain, the deposited materials were dragged by the erosive action of the rivers.

During the alpine orogeny, the materials that formed the plateau broke through multiple points. From this fracture rose the mountains of León, with mountains of not much height and, constituting the spine of the Plateau (Meseta), the Cantabrian Mountains and the Sistema Central, formed by materials such as granite or metamorphic slates.

The karst complex of Ojo Guareña, consisting of 110 km of galleries and its caves formed in carbonatic materials of Coniacian which are situated on a level of impermeable marls, is the second largest of the peninsula.

This geological configuration has allowed upwellings of mineral-medicinal or thermal water, used now or in the past, in Almeida de Sayago, Boñar, Calabor, Caldas de Luna, Castromonte, Cucho, Gejuelo del Barro, Morales de Campos, Tresacasas, Valdelateja and Villarijo, among other places.

===Hydrography===

====Rivers====
;Douro basin

The main hydrographic network of Castile and León is constituted by the Douro river and its tributaries. From its source in the Picos de Urbión, in Soria, to its mouth in the Portuguese city of Porto, the Douro covers 897 km. From the north descend the Pisuerga, the Valderaduey and the Esla rivers, its tributaries more plentiful and by the east, with less water in its flows, highlight the Adaja and the Duratón. After passing the town of Zamora, the Douro is confined between the canyons of the Arribes del Duero Natural Park, bordering with Portugal. On the left bank are important tributaries such as Tormes, Huebra, Águeda, Côa and Paiva, all from Sistema Central. On the right they reach the Sabor, the Tua and the Tâmega, born in the Galician Massif. After the Arribes area, the Douro turns west into Portugal until it empties into the Atlantic Ocean.

; Other watersheds
Several rivers of the community pour their waters into the Ebro basin, in Palencia, Burgos and Soria (Jalón river), that of Miño-Sil in León and Zamora, that of the Tagus in Ávila and Salamanca (rivers Tiétar and Alberche and Alagón respectively) and Cantabrian basin in the provinces through which the Cantabrian Mountains extends.

====Lakes and reservoirs====

In addition to the rivers, the Douro basin also hosts a large number of lakes and lagoons such as the Negra de Urbión Lake, in the Picos de Urbión, the Grande de Gredos Lake, in Gredos, the Sanabria Lake, in Zamora or the La Nava de Fuentes Lake in Palencia. Also emphasize a great amount of reservoirs, fed by the water coming from the rains and the thaw of the snowy summits. Thus, Castile and León, despite not having abundant rainfall, is one of the communities in Spain with the highest level of water dammed.

Many of these natural lakes are being used as an economic resource, boosting rural tourism and helping to conserve ecosystems. The Sanabria Lake was a pioneer in this.

===Climate===
Castile and León has a continental Mediterranean climate, with long, cold winters, with average temperatures between 3 and 6 °C in January and short, hot summers (average 19 to 22 °C), but with the three or four months of summer aridity characteristic of the Mediterranean climate. Rainfall, with an average of 450–500 mm per year, is scarce, accentuating in the lower lands.

;Climatic factors

In Castile and León the cold extends almost continuously for much of the year, being a very characteristic element of its climate. The coldest periods of winter are associated with invasions of a continental polar front and strata of marine arctic air, rare is that they do not reach temperatures of the order of -5 ° to -10 °C. Likewise, in situations of anticyclone, in the interior of the region they cause persistent fogs, creating prolonged cold situations due to radiation processes. The intense &quot;cold waves&quot; of the winter central months are typical, showing a particular tendency to occur from the second fortnight of December to the first of February. During its course the most extreme minimum temperatures occur, whose values vary between -10 ° and -13 °C of its westernmost sector and -15 ° and -20 °C of the central plains and high moorlands. The lowest recorded records reach -22 °C of Burgos, -21.9 °C in Coca (Segovia), -20.4 °C in Ávila, -20 °C in Salamanca and -19.2 °C in Soria. The high altitude of the Meseta and its mountains accentuates the contrast between winter and summer temperatures, as well as day and night temperatures.

Maritime winds are stopped by the mountainous barriers that surround Castile and León, stopping also the precipitations and causing the rains to fall very unequally in the Castilian and Leonese territory. While in the middle of the Douro basin there is an annual average of 450 mm, in the western regions of the mountains of León, the Cantabrian Mountains and the southern area of the provinces of Ávila and Salamanca, rainfall reaches 1500 mm per year, with a maximum of 3400 mm per year in the western part of the Sierra de Gredos, in the Candelario-Bejar Massif, which makes this area the rainiest not only from Spain, but from the Iberian Peninsula.

; Climatic regions
Although Castile and León is framed within the continental climate, in its lands different climate domains are distinguished:
*According to the Köppen climate classification, a large part of the autonomous community falls within the Csb or Cfb variants, with the average of the warmest month below 22 °C but above 10 °C for five or more months.
*In several areas of the Meseta Central the climate is classified as Csa (warm Mediterranean), by exceeding 22 °C during the summer.
*In high elevations of the Cantabrian Mountains and mountain areas, there is a cold temperate climate with average temperatures under 3 °C in the coldest months and dry summers (Dsb or Dsc).

===Nature===
====Flora====

Castile and León has many protected natural sites. Actively collaborates with the European Union program &quot;Natura 2000&quot;. There are also some special protection area for birds or SPA.
The solitary evergreen oaks and junipers (&quot;Juniperus sect. Sabina&quot;) that now draw the Castilian-Leonese plain are remnants of the forests that covered these same lands long ago. The agricultural holdings, due to the need of land for the cultivation of cereal and pastures for the immense herds of the Castilian Plateau, supposed the deforestation of these lands during the Middle Ages. The last Castilian and Leonese forests of junipers are found in the provinces of León, Soria and Burgos. They are not very leafy forests that can form mixed communities with evergreen oaks, Portuguese oaks or pines.
The Castilian-Leonese slope of the Cantabrian Mountains and the northern foothills of the Sistema Ibérico have a rich vegetation. The most humid and fresh slopes are populated by large beeches, whose extension areas can reach 1,500 m altitude. In turn, the European beech forms mixed forests with the yew, the sorbus, the whitebeam, the European holly and the birch. On the sunny slopes the sessile oak, the European oak, the ash, the lime tree, the sweet chestnut, the birch and the scots pine (a typical species from the north of the province of León).

====Fauna====

Castile and León presents a great diversity of fauna. There are numerous species and some of them are of special interest because of their uniqueness, such as some endemic species, or because of their scarcity, such as the brown bear. There have been counted 418 species of vertebrates, which make up 63% of all vertebrates that live in Spain. Animals adapted to life in the high mountains, inhabitants of rocky places, inhabitants of fluvial courses, species of plains and forest residents form the mosaic of the Castilian-Leonese fauna.

The isolation to which the high summits are subject leads to the existence of abundant endemisms such as the Spanish ibex, which in Gredos constitutes a unique subspecies in the Peninsula. The European snow vole is a graceful small mammal of grayish brown color and long tail that lives in open spaces over the limit of the trees.

Small and large mammals such as squirrel, dormouse, talpids, European pine marten, Beech marten, fox, wildcat, wolf, quite abundant in some areas, boar, deer, roe deer and, only in the Cantabrian Mountains, some specimens of brown bear tend to frequent the deciduous forests, although some species also extend to coniferous forests and scrubland. The wildcat is slightly larger than a domestic cat, has a short and stout tail, with dark rings and striped fur. The Iberian lynx, however, lives almost exclusively in areas of Mediterranean scrubland.
Small reptiles such as the ladder snake, the coronella girondica and the aesculapian snake are also found in this environment. The smooth snake can be found from sea level to 1,800 m in height and in the community it tends to live on the heights. Further up, in the rocky areas of the subalpine floor at about 2,400 m altitude the Iberian rock lizard lives, one of the few reptiles adapted at this point.

In the mountain rivers live the otter and desman and in its waters the trout, anguillidae, the common minnows and some of the increasingly scarce autochthonous river crabs. The otter and the desman are two mammals with aquatic habits and very good swimmers. The otter feeds mainly on fish, while the desman seeks its food among the aquatic invertebrates that inhabit the riverbed. In lower sections of calmer waters swim barbel s and carps. Among the amphibians, the salamanders and as remarkable species: the Almanzor salamander (&quot;Salamandra salamandra almanzoris&quot;) and the Gredos toad (&quot;Bufo bufo gredosicola&quot;), which are two endemic subspecies to the Sistema Central.

Where the rivers are encased forming sickles and canyons, rock-dwelling birds such as griffon vulture, cinereous vulture, Egyptian vulture, golden eagle or peregrine falcon. The Egyptian vulture, a small vulture, is black and white with a yellow head. Downstream and on its banks between the lush vegetation form their colonies the black-crowned night heron and the grey heron and the goldcrest, the eurasian penduline tit, the eurasian hoopoe and the common kingfisher.
Among the birds that populate the open Mediterranean forests live two endangered species: the black stork and the Spanish imperial eagle. The black stork, much rarer than its congener the white stork, is of solitary habits and lives far from man. The Spanish imperial eagle nests in the trees and feeds mainly on rabbits, but also birds, reptiles and carrion.
In the coniferous forests live among others the short-toed treecreeper, the coal tit and the eurasian nuthatch, a bird of gray back and flanks reddish-orange that it nests in holes to which it narrows the entrance with mud. The western capercaillie is a very dark and large rooster that lives in forest environments, so it is very difficult to observe. Among the forest raptors are the accipiter, the eurasian sparrowhawk or the tawny owl, which frequently attack other smaller birds such as eurasian jay, iberian green woodpecker, fringilla, great spotted woodpecker and typical warbler.

The bustard frequents the open plains with rain-fed crops; It is large and has a grayish head and neck and a brown back. In the Castilian-Leonese wetlands during the winter many specimens of greylag goose, which breeds in northern Europe and visits the area in winter, are concentrated.

The naturalist Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente (1928 – 1980), natural from Poza de la Sal, stands out in the scientific study and its dissemination. He had a great research and made the leap to fame with the television series &quot;El hombre y la Tierra&quot; (TVE).

In the Montaña Palentina, in the municipality of San Cebrián de Mudá, a program of reintroduction of the European bison, animal that had been a thousand years without presence in the Iberian Peninsula, in order to avoid the extinction of the species.

==Demography==
With 2 391 682 inhabitants (1 January 2024), the population of Castile and León represents 4.92% of the population of Spain, although its vast territory covers almost a fifth of the total area of the country. In January 2024, the population of Castile and León was divided, by province, as follows: Province of Ávila, 160 463 inhabitants; Province of Burgos, 359 740; Province of León, 447 802; Province of Palencia, 158 063; Province of Salamanca, 327 552; Province of Segovia, 156 620; Province of Soria, 90 073; Province of Valladolid, 525 398; and Province of Zamora, 166 253.

The autonomous community has a very low population density, around 25.38 inhabitants/km2, a record that is more than three times lower than the national average, which indicates that it is a sparsely populated and demographically decline, especially in rural areas and even in small traditional cities. The demographic characteristics of the territory show an aging population, with a low birth rate and mortality that approaches the state average.

In the year 2000, the population of Castile and León totaled 2 479 118 people, that is, 6.12% of the Spanish total. Its natural growth was one of the lowest in Spain: -7223 (-2.92 gross rate), as a result of the difference between the 25 080 deaths (10.12 of the gross rate) and the 17 857 births ( 7.20 gross rate). The number of inhabitants in 1999 was slightly higher (2 488 062), so that, despite the negative growth, the relative numerical stability is partly due to the increase in immigration: of 22 910 immigrants in 1999 it went to 24 340 in 2000. In that year, 59 children under the age of one year died.

The life expectancy is higher than the Spanish average: 83.24 for women and 78.30 for men, a superiority that in 1999 was repeated in the register, since women added 1 260 906 and the males 1 227 156. A study by the University of Porto (Portugal) cites Castile and León as one of the European regions where old people could expect to live longer.

In 1999, the age distribution gave the following results: 317 783 people from 0 to 14 years old; 913 618 between 15 and 39 years old; 576 183 from 40 to 59 years and 677 020 over 60 years.

The active population in 2001 was 1 005 200 and occupied 884 200 people, with which the unemployment was 12.1% of the active population. For sectors of the employed population, 10.9% worked in agriculture, 20.6% in the industry, 12.7% in construction, and 63,1% in the services sector.

===Historical evolution===

Many of the people of the territory, who devoted themselves mostly to agriculture and livestock, gradually abandoned the area, heading towards urban areas, much more prosperous. This situation was further aggravated at the end of the Spanish Civil War, with a progressive rural emigration. During the 1960s and 1980s, large urban centers and provincial capitals suffered a slight demographic increase due to a thorough urbanization process, although, despite this, the Castilian-Leonese area continues to suffer serious depopulation. Only the provinces of Burgos, Valladolid and Segovia are gaining population in recent years.

There is also an increase in the population of metropolitan areas around cities such as Valladolid, Burgos or León. Due to this phenomenon, cities such as Laguna de Duero or San Andrés del Rabanedo have seen their population increase rapidly in a few years. The metropolitan area of the city of Valladolid is, by far, the largest in the autonomous community, with more than 430 000 inhabitants.

However, in absolute terms the autonomous community is losing population and aging. In 2011, it was one of only four autonomous communities that lost population along with Asturias, Galicia and Aragon.

===Present-day population distribution===

In 1960 the urban population meant 20.6% of the total population of Castile and León; in 1991 this percentage had risen to 42.3% and in 1998 it was approaching 43%, which indicates the progressive rural depopulation. The phenomenon is also reflected in the number of municipalities with less than 100 inhabitants, which was multiplied by seven between 1960 and 1986. Outside the provincial capitals, the largest towns are Miranda de Ebro and Aranda de Duero in the province of Burgos, Ponferrada and San Andrés del Rabanedo in the province of León, Béjar in the province of Salamanca, El Espinar and Cuéllar in the province of Segovia, Arévalo in the province of Ávila, Benavente in the province of Zamora, El Burgo de Osma in the province of Soria, Aguilar de Campóo in the province of Palencia and Medina del Campo and Laguna de Duero in the province of Valladolid.

Of the 2248 municipalities of this community, the 2014 registry registered 1986 with less than 1000 inhabitants; 204 from 1001 to 5000; 35 from 5001 to 10 000; 8 of 10 001 to 20 000; 6 of 20 001 to 50 000; 5 of 50 001 to 100 000 and 4 municipalities with more than 100 000 inhabitants. The latter are: Valladolid (306 830 hab.), Burgos (177 776 hab.), Salamanca (148 042 hab.) And León (129 551 hab.) Among the least populated are, between others: Jaramillo Quemado (Burgos), with 4 inhabitants, Estepa de San Juan (Soria), with 7, Quiñonería (Soria), with 8 and Villanueva de Gormaz (Soria), with 9.

There is a table below showing the largest municipalities in terms of population according to the municipal census of the INE of 2024:
===Religion===

Catholicism is the predominant religion in the community. According to the barometer of the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS) conducted in October 2019, 76.8% of Castilian-Leonese are considered Catholics (43.2 Non-Practising and 33.6% Practising), and non-believers 20.3%.

Actual attendance at a church is on average less than these figures show. According to the same study, only half of self identifying Catholics go to mass regularly with those considered &quot;practicing&quot; Catholics attending more regularly than those considered &quot;non practicing&quot;.

===Foreign population===

As of 2018, the region had a foreign population of 123,575. The largest groups of foreigners were those of Romanian, Bulgarian, Moroccan and Portuguese citizenship.

==Languages==

Spanish is the only official and preponderant language throughout the territory. The phenomena of &quot;leísmo&quot; and &quot;laísmo&quot; are considered to be deviations characteristic of the varieties of Spanish spoken in the region, later irradiating to other territories.

In addition to Spanish (also referred to in the Spanish-speaking world as ; ), other languages or linguistic varieties are spoken in small areas of Castile and León: the Leonese language, that &quot;will be subject to specific protection [...] because of its particular value within the Community&#x27;s linguistic heritage&quot; and Galician language, which, according to the Statute of Autonomy, &quot;will enjoy respect and protection in the places where it is usually used&quot; (fundamentally, in the border areas with Galicia of the comarcas of El Bierzo and Sanabria). In the Salamancan comarca of El Rebollar, a modality of Extremaduran language is spoken (of the Asturian-Leonese branch) known as Palra d&#x27;El Rebollal. In Merindad de Sotoscueva (province of Burgos) a Castilian is spoken with some dialectal features of the Asturian-Leonese. In the Treviño enclave, as of 2012 about a fifth of the population spoke Basque. 

Languages spoken by some of the largest immigrant communities include Bulgarian, Romanian, and Arabic.

==Administration and politics==

===Territorial organization===
The community is the sum of nine provinces: Province of Ávila, Province of Burgos, Province of León, Province of Palencia, Province of Salamanca, Province of Segovia, Province of Soria, Province of Valladolid and Province of Zamora. The provincial capitals fall in the homonymous cities to their corresponding provinces.

The concurrence of some peculiar geographical, social, historical and economic characteristics is legally recognized for El Bierzo (an area that was a province on its own in the project of initial provincial division, though it disappeared in the 1833 territorial division of Spain), and the comarca of &quot;El Bierzo&quot; was created in 1991, with its center in Ponferrada. It is the only Castilian-Leonese territory recognized by law outside the normal provincial division, and it is administered by a Comarcal Council. Castile and León also includes the exclave of Treviño, surrounded by the Basque province of Araba/Álava.

====Provision of services====
The new territorial arrangement approved by Law 7/2013, on Planning, Services and Government of the Territory of the Community of Castile and León, establishes that the geographical spaces delimited for the provision of services are the basic unit of territorial planning and services (UBOST) -urban or rural- and functional areas -stable or strategic-. Also, the new ordination determines that the mancommunities of common interest are entities for the fulfillment of their specific purposes, which may be declared when their territorial scope substantially agrees with an UBOST or several contiguous ones.

This ordination is still in the implementation phase, and in September 2015 the draft map dividing the autonomous community was presented in 147 rural UBOST and 15 urban UBOST.

===Autonomous institutions===
The main autonomous institutions are:
*Junta de Castilla y León (Regional Government of Castile and León), with headquarters in Valladolid, is the regional executive, formed by the President of the Regional Government, the vice presidents and the councilors
*Cortes de Castilla y León (Parliament of Castile and León), based in Valladolid
*Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Castilla y León (Upper Court of Justice of Castile and León), based in Burgos
The Statute of Autonomy does not explicitly establish one capital. Initially the Cortes were installed provisionally in Burgos; the possibility of fixing a capital in Tordesillas was also discussed, although the final decision was to install the Cortes provisionally in the castle of Fuensaldaña.

The region&#x27;s 1983 statute of autonomy did not name a capital. The articles referred only to the &quot;seat of government&quot;, that could only be fixed with a two-thirds approval in the Cortes of Castile and León. In 1987, President of the Junta of Castile and León José María Aznar approved that the basic bodies of regional rule – the presidency, Junta and the Cortes – would be located in Valladolid.

One reason for the lack of the official capital is that the merger of Castile and León as one autonomous community caused uproar in the latter, which wanted to be separate. Other autonomous bodies are in the capitals of other provinces of the region. The High Court of Justice of Castile and León is in Burgos, the Court of Audits is in Palencia, the Advisory Council is in Zamora, the Ombudsman is in León.

In March 2009, the Junta of Castile and León apologised for school textbooks that named Valladolid as capital, saying that it was an honest confusion of its status as a seat. In February 2010, the People&#x27;s Party in Valladolid City Hall rejected a Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party proposal for the city to become the official capital, saying it could &quot;provoke eight motions against it&quot; from the other provincial capitals. In September 2019, José Antonio de Santiago Juárez of Valladolid&#x27;s PP made a proposal of the same matter, which was opposed by the party leadership.

===Cortes of Castile and León===
During the first legislature, the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party was the party with the most representation in Cortes, being the first president of the community the Socialist Demetrio Madrid. Since the 1990s, regional policy has been framed by a series of absolute majorities of the People&#x27;s Party, which continues to comfortably govern at present. Other national parties with presence in the community, either locally or regionally, are United Left (previously as Communist Party of Spain) and Union, Progress and Democracy, with a significant presence in the provinces of Ávila and Burgos. Previously Democratic and Social Centre of Adolfo Suárez also managed to be in the regional political life occupying the reformist center of the political spectrum.

The Leonesism through the Leonese People&#x27;s Union, the Castilianism through Party of Castile and León, previously Commoners&#x27; Land or localistas parties like Independent Solution, Group of Zamoran Independent Electoral Members or Initiative for the Development of Soria have also had their presence, although at a lower level.

The community is governed by Alfonso Fernández Mañueco, of the People&#x27;s Party. This party obtained 29 procurators in the 2019 Castilian-Leonese regional election. Mañueco&#x27;s investiture was supported by the party Citizens, with 12 representatives. The party that obtained the most seats at the election, the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party is in opposition, with 35 representatives. The leader of the opposition is Luis Tudanca. In addition, four more formations obtained parliamentary representation in the region: Podemos (2 seats), Vox (1), XÁvila (1) and Leonese People&#x27;s Union (1).

A 2024 law passed by the regional Castile and León coalition (including Vox and the People&#x27;s Party) omitted any mention of General Franco as a dictator, which sparked criticism.

===Human rights===

The roots of modern human rights theories has its origins in Castile and León. The School of Salamanca was an intellectual movement of 16th-century where humanism raised, being its major contributor Francisco de Vitoria.

The Valladolid debate was the first moral debate in European history to discuss the rights and treatment of Indigenous people by European colonizers.

Castile and León is the only autonomous region in Spain without a specific regional law protecting LGBTQ+ citizens. Several LGBTQ+ organizations exists in the region, such as Segovia Entiende, Espacio Seguro LGBTQ+ Burgos, Chiguitxs LGTB+ Palencia, Arco Ávila, Awen León or Fundación Triangulo Castilla y León.

Since 2022 the Festival Zorrilla´s Fest is celebrated annually in Valladolid during Pride Week to promote LGBTQ+ artists and local LGBTQ+ engagement. Since then artists such as Samantha Hudson, Putochinomaricón, Javiera Mena or Tremenda Jauría have performed in the Festival.

The first transgender person in Spain to reach Professor level at University is Marina Sáenz, in the Law School of Valladolid University. 

Abortion law is applied as in the rest of the country, but women might suffer difficulties due to the high proportion of medical practitioners objecting to practise abortions.

==Economy==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 57.9 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 4.8% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 25,800 euros or 85% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 97% of the EU average.

===Unemployment rate===
In July 2009, in full Great Recession, unemployment reached 14.14% of the population, when in 2007 it was half, 6,99%. According to the survey of the employment of the fourth quarter of 2014, the employment rate is 54.91% and the unemployment rate is 20.28%, while the national figure is 59,77% of employment and 23.70% of unemployed. Below the regional average of unemployment are Segovia (14.33%), Valladolid (16.65%), Soria (16.96%) and Burgos (18.76%), while above Salamanca (21,25%), León (22.65%), Palencia (23.22%), Ávila (25.33%) and Zamora (26.62%).

The unemployment rate stood at 14.1% in 2017 and was slightly lower than the national average.
===Primary sector===
;Field
The fields of Castile and Leon are arid and dry although very fertile, predominating in them the dryland farming. Despite this, irrigation has been gaining importance in the areas of the valleys of Douro, Esla, Órbigo, Pisuerga and Tormes. The scarce orography and the improvement of communications has favored the entry of technical innovations throughout the process of agricultural production, especially in areas such as the province of Valladolid or the province of Burgos where the production per hectare is one of the highest in Spain. The most fertile Castilian-Leonese area coincides with the Esla valley, in León, in the fields of Valladolid and Tierra de Campos, a district that extends between province of Zamora, province of Valladolid, province of Palencia and province of León.

;Use of arable land

Castile and León has an agricultural area close to 5,783,831 hectares, which is more than half of the total area of its total territory. Most of the farmland is dryland, due to the climate and the low rainfall. Only 10% of the area is irrigated, with plots of intensive production, much more profitable than dryland crops.

Despite the decline of the population in rural areas, the Castilian-Leonese agricultural production still represents 15% of the Spanish primary sector and its average occupation is lower than that of other autonomous communities.

;Types of crop

Castile and León constitutes one of the main Spanish cereal areas. As the popular saying says: &quot;Castile, granary of Spain&quot;. Although the most traditional crop was wheat, the production of barley has gained ground since the 1960s. These two cereals are followed, in number of hectares cultivated and volume of production, rye and oats. In addition to legumes, such as carob and chickpeas, sunflower cultivation has spread in the southern countryside.

The vineyard (56,337 ha) saw the number of hectares cultivated during the last three decades of the 20th century decrease considerably; However, the application of the most modern aging techniques has notably improved the Castilian-Leonese wines, which compete in quality with those of La Rioja and begin to be known outside the Spanish borders. The main viticultural areas of the region are Ribera del Duero (DO), Rueda (DO), Toro (DO), Bierzo (DO), Arribes (DO) and Tierra de León (DO). Irrigated land is planted with sugar beet, a product that has been subsidized by the regional authorities, potatoes, alfalfa and vegetables. In the province of León, corn, hops and legumes are also sown.

;Livestock

Livestock represents an important part of the final agricultural production. Next to the small livestock units, which proliferate in the regions of pre-eminent agricultural dedication or in the mountain areas, now appears a modern livestock activity, with cattle, pig and sheep farms, of development. These farms are oriented both to the production of meat and to the supply of milk to the cooperatives that channel their subsequent commercialization, since the dairy production of Castile and León -more than one and a half million liters per year- is the second largest in Spain, only surpassed by Galicia.

Thus, small livestock farms tend to disappear, largely due to the effect of rural depopulation and the consequent loss of labor. Transhumant grazing is conserved in some areas; large herds, mainly sheep, travel every year hundreds of kilometers from the flat lands to the land with mountain pastures as in the El Bierzo, the Cantabrian valleys of province of León, the sierra de Gredos or Picos de Urbión. It is hard work that every time has less labor, having previously constituted a testimony of first importance on the history and cultural roots of the Castilian and Leonese people.

The sheep herd is the most numerous, with 5,425,000 heads, followed by domestic pig (2,800,000) and cattle (1,200,000). A long way away is the goats (166,200 heads) and horses (71,700 horses, mules and donkeys). The highest production of meat corresponds to that of pigs (241,700 t), followed by bovine (89,400 t) and poultry (66,000 t); in wool production Castile and León leads the national balance with 7,500 t. Within the section of Protected Geographical indication (I.G.P), highlights Lechazo de Castilla y León, based in Aranda de Duero.

;Forest exploitation
In Castile and León there are about 1,900,000 hectares of non-arboreal, representing 40% of the total forest area. This deforestation is mainly due to the hand of the man who, over the centuries, has made forests disappear, giving way to areas of non-arboreal vegetation. Little by little, with the abandonment of rural areas and the reforestation policy of the Castilian and Leonese governments, this situation has been reversed.

===Secondary sector===
;Industry
During 2000, the Castile and León industry occupied 18% of the active population and contributed 25% of GDP. The most developed industrial axis is that of Valladolid-Palencia-Burgos-Miranda de Ebro-Aranda de Duero, where there is an important car industry, paper industry, aeronautics and chemistry, and is where most of the industrial activity of the Castilian-Leonese territory is concentrated. The food industry derived from the farm and livestock, with flour, sunflower oil and wines, among others is also important, especially in the Ribera del Duero comarca, especially in Aranda de Duero.

The main industrial poles of the community are: Valladolid (21,054 workers dedicated to the sector), Burgos (20,217), Aranda de Duero (4,872), León (4,521), Ponferrada (4,270) and Ólvega (4,075).

Other industries are textiles in Béjar, roof tiles and bricks in Palencia, sugar in León, Valladolid, Toro, Miranda de Ebro and Benavente, the pharmaceutical company in León, Valladolid and mainly in Aranda de Duero with a factory of the GlaxoSmithKline group, the metallurgical and steel company in Ponferrada and the chemistry in Miranda de Ebro and Valladolid, the aeronautics in Miranda de Ebro and Valladolid. In the remaining capitals there is a food industry derived from the agricultural and livestock exploitation, with flour, sunflower oil and wines, among others. This regional agro-food industry is flagged by Calidad Pascual based in Aranda de Duero. In the agricultural industry, within the production of fertilizers, the Mirat, founded in 1812 in Salamanca, stands out.

In Soria the logging industry and furniture manufacturing is also relevant to the regional economy.

The president of the Castilian-Leonese employers&#x27; association is currently Ginés Clemente, owner of the Aciturri Aeronáutica, based in Miranda de Ebro. It is a leading international aeronautical group, with contracts with groups such as Boeing and Airbus, which makes Castile and León a benchmark in the sector.

;Construction
The 16,34% of the companies in Castile and León belong to the auxiliary sector of construction. Among the largest companies in the sector, the following stand out: Grupo Pantersa, Begar, Grupo MRS, Isolux Corsán, Llorente Corporation, Volconsa and of auxiliary construction sector, Artepref of Gerardo de la Calle Group.

;Mining

In Castile and León, the mining activity acquired great importance in the Roman times, when a road was drawn, the Vía de la Plata, to transfer the gold extracted in the deposits of Las Médulas, in the Leonese comarca of El Bierzo, the route started from Asturica Augusta (Astorga) to Emerita Augusta (Mérida) and Hispalis (Seville).

Centuries later, after the Spanish Civil War, mining was one of the factors that contributed to the economic development of the region. However, the production of iron, tin and tungsten decreased notably from the 1970s, while bituminous coal and anthracite mines were maintained thanks to the domestic demand for coal for thermal power plants. The economic reconversion that affected the Leonese mining basin and Palencian mining basin during the 1980s and 1990s resulted in the closure of numerous mines, social impoverishment, with a sharp increase of unemployment and the beginning of a new migratory movement towards other Spanish regions. Despite the investments of the Mining Action Plan of the Junta de Castilla y León, traditional coal mining operations have entered into a severe crisis.

;Energy sources

Castile and León is a net producer of electric energy, with a generation/demand ratio in 2021 of 197% (27,016 GWh vs. 13,670 GWh).

In addition to the northern basin, in those of the Douro and Ebro rivers there are numerous hydroelectric plants that allow Castile and León to be one of the first autonomous communities producing electricity. Among others are those of Burguillo, Rioscuro, Las Ondinas, Cornatel, Bárcena, Aldeadávila I and II, Saucelle I and II, Castro I and II, Villalcampo I and II, Valparaíso and Ricobayo I and II.

The total installed hydraulic power amounts to 3,979 MW and annual production in 2010 was 5,739 GWH. Only in the system Saltos del Duero there are more than 3000 MW installed. In this way, Castile and León is the first Spanish autonomous community in installed capacity and the second in production.

The nuclear power is 466 MW, having produced 3,579.85 GWh in 2009. The only nuclear plant in Castile and León on 1 August 2017, was definitively and irrevocably closed.
The coal thermal produces around 16,956 GWh per year at the following plants:

;Thermal power stations in Castile and León


The region stands out for the importance of the production of renewable energy. Castile and León is the community that covers the largest proportion of its electricity demand through renewable energies: 82,9% in 2009. Traditional hydroelectric power It has been added with force since the late 1990s and 2000 wind power, with more than 100 parks in operation and a production of 5,449 GWh in that same year. By provinces, it is at the top Burgos with 46, and a total of 3,128 MW of installed power.
Among the non-renewable energies is also the natural gas (194 MW of installed power) and fuel-diesel fuel (69 MW).

The provinces of Valladolid and Burgos are the most economically advanced regions, with a GDP per capita higher than the national average. Even so, the average GDP per capita of the community of Castile and León is slightly below than average, at 21,244 euros per inhabitant.

===Tertiary sector===
====Tourism====
Some of its tourism highlights include the walls of Ávila, and the cathedrals of Burgos and Leon.

Castile and León has several cities whose Holy Week is considered to be of International Tourist Interest. Examples are Holy Week in León, Holy Week in Salamanca, Holy Week in Valladolid or Holy Week in Zamora.

The region also has a wide network of Paradores, hotels of great quality that usually accommodate buildings of great historical value in privileged places to stimulate tourism in the area.

Since 1988, the foundation &quot;Las Edades del Hombre&quot; has been organizing various exhibitions of religious art in various parts of the national and international geography, highlighting for its interest the exhibitions held in Castile and León. The idea of carrying out these exhibitions was conceived in a chimney of Alcazarén with the writer José Jiménez Lozano and the priest of Valladolid José Velicia. The first &quot;Las Edades del Hombre&quot; were held in the Church of Santiago Apóstol of Alcazarén, with a small exhibition of sacred paintings. Later, and with the support of important personalities, the first known exhibition was held among the public, which was that of Valladolid. In 2012 the initiative was developed under the name of &quot;Monacatus&quot; in the town of Oña, being one of the most multitudinous editions with about 200 000 visitors. The last sample so far has taken place in the municipality of Arévalo, in 2013. With the title of &quot;Credo&quot;, the exhibition has revolved around the faith and has received more than 226 000 visitors.

===Domestic trade and exports abroad===

The internal trade of Castile and León is concentrated in the sector of food, automotive, fabric and footwear. For foreign trade, according to the region, vehicles and car chassis are mainly exported in Province of Ávila, Province of Palencia and Province of Valladolid, tires in Province of Burgos and Province of Valladolid, steel bars and slate manufactures in León, beef in Province of Salamanca, pigs in Province of Segovia, rubber manufactures in Province of Soria and goat and sheep meat, together with wine, in Province of Zamora.

Castile and León also exports a lot of wine, being Province of Valladolid the one that more bottles sells abroad. As regards imports, vehicles and their accessories, such as engines or tires, are in the lead. The Region also imports mainly products from France, Italy, United Kingdom, [Germany, [Portugal and the United States and exports mostly to the countries of the European Union and to Turkey, Israel and United States.

The line from Paris to Lisbon crosses the region, reaching the Portuguese frontier at Fuentes de Oñoro in Salamanca. Astorga, Burgos, León, Miranda de Ebro, Palencia, Ponferrada, Medina del Campo and Valladolid are all important railway junctions.

Railways operate in several different gauges: Iberian gauge (), UIC gauge () and narrow-gauge (). Except for some narrow-gauge lines, trains are operated by Renfe on lines maintained by the Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias (ADIF); both of these are national, state-owned companies. 

====Narrow gauge====

*León - Bilbao: Ferrocarril de La Robla, Europe&#x27;s longest narrow-gauge line, operated by Renfe Feve
*Cercedilla - Cotos: operated by Renfe
*Ponferrada - Villablino: operated by the Ferrocarril MSP under the Junta of Castile and León

===Roads===
The region is also crossed by two major ancient routes:
*The Way of St. James, mentioned above as a World Heritage Site, now a hiking trail and a motorway, from east to west.
*The Roman Via de la Plata (&quot;Silver Way&quot;), mentioned above in the context of mining, now a main road through the west of the region.

The road network is regulated by the Ley de carreteras 10/2008 de Castilla y León (Highway Law 10/2008 of Castile and León).

<doc id="70261" wikidata="Q1638044" url="?curid=70261" title="Safeword">
<text>In BDSM, a safeword is a code word, series of code words or other signal used by a person to communicate their physical or emotional state, typically when approaching, or crossing, a physical, emotional, or moral boundary. Some safewords are used to &quot;stop&quot; the scene outright, while others can communicate a willingness to continue, but at a reduced level of intensity. 

==Description==

Safewords are usually agreed upon before playing a scene by all participants, and many organized BDSM groups have standard safewords that all members agree to use to avoid confusion at organized play events. The most common safeword system is the &quot;traffic light&quot; system, in which &quot;red&quot; means &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;amber&quot; or &quot;yellow&quot; means &quot;proceed with caution&quot;, and &quot;green&quot; means &quot;more, please!&quot;

Some couples may feel that they do not need a safeword, depending on the practices involved, since the role of a safeword is filled by usual forms of communication. Less commonly, some couples may agree to abandon the use of safewords including the ability to withdraw consent altogether, especially those that practice forms of edgeplay or those in Master/slave relationships. In such cases, the choice to give up the use of safewords is a consensual act on the part of the bottom or submissive. This practice is usually called consensual non-consent and often considered controversial.

<doc id="70277" wikidata="Q502339" url="?curid=70277" title="Pillow lava">
<text>Pillow lavas are lavas that contain characteristic pillow-shaped structures that are attributed to the extrusion of the lava underwater, or &quot;subaqueous extrusion&quot;. Pillow lavas in volcanic rock are characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses, commonly up to one meter in diameter. They form the upper part of Layer 2 of normal oceanic crust.

==Composition==

Pillow lavas are commonly of basaltic composition, although pillows formed of komatiite, picrite, boninite, basaltic andesite, andesite, dacite or even rhyolite are known. In general, the more felsic the composition (richer in silica - resulting in an Intermediate composition), the larger the pillows, due to the increase in viscosity of the erupting lava.

==Occurrence==
They occur wherever lava is extruded underwater, such as along marine hotspot volcano chains and the constructive plate boundaries of mid-ocean ridges. As new oceanic crust is formed, thick sequences of pillow lavas are erupted at the spreading center fed by dykes from the underlying magma chamber. Pillow lavas and the related sheeted dyke complexes form part of a classic ophiolite sequence (when a segment of oceanic crust is thrust over the continental crust, thus exposing the oceanic segment above sea level).

The presence of pillow lavas in the oldest preserved volcanic sequences on the planet, the Isua and Barberton greenstone belts, confirms the presence of large bodies of water on the Earth&#x27;s surface early in the Archean Eon. Pillow lavas are used generally to confirm subaqueous volcanism in metamorphic belts.

Pillow lavas are also found associated with some subglacial volcanoes at an early stage of an eruption.

==Formation==
They are created when magma reaches the surface but, as there is a large difference in temperature between the lava and the water, the surface of the emergent tongue cools very quickly, forming a skin. The tongue continues to lengthen and inflate with more lava, forming a lobe, until the pressure of the magma becomes sufficient to rupture the skin and start the formation of a new eruption point nearer the vent. This process produces a series of interconnecting lobate shapes that are pillow-like in cross-section. The skin cools much faster than the inside of the pillow, so it is very fine-grained, with a glassy texture. The magma inside the pillow cools slowly, so it is slightly coarser-grained than the skin, but it is still classified as fine grained.

==Use as a way-up criterion==
Pillow lavas can be used as a way-up indicator in geology; that is, study of their shape reveals the attitude, or position, in which they were originally formed. Pillow lava shows it is still in its original orientation when:
# Vesicles are found towards the top of a pillow (because the gas trapped as part of the rock is less dense than its solid surroundings).
# The pillow structures show a convex (rounded) upper surface.
# The pillows might have a tapered base downwards, as they may have molded themselves to any underlying pillows during their formation.

<text>The trachea (: tracheae or tracheas), also known as the windpipe, is a cartilaginous tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs, allowing the passage of air, and so is present in almost all animals lungs. The trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two primary bronchi. At the top of the trachea, the cricoid cartilage attaches it to the larynx. The trachea is formed by a number of horseshoe-shaped rings, joined together vertically by overlying ligaments, and by the trachealis muscle at their ends. The epiglottis closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing.

The trachea begins to form in the second month of embryo development, becoming longer and more fixed in its position over time. Its epithelium is lined with column-shaped cells that have hair-like extensions called cilia, with scattered goblet cells that produce protective mucins. The trachea can be affected by inflammation or infection, usually as a result of a viral illness affecting other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the larynx and bronchi, called croup, that can result in a cough. Infection with bacteria usually affects the trachea only and can cause narrowing or even obstruction. As a major part of the respiratory tract, when obstructed the trachea prevents air entering the lungs and so a tracheostomy may be required if the trachea is obstructed. Additionally, during surgery if mechanical ventilation is required when a person is sedated, a tube is inserted into the trachea, called tracheal intubation.

The word &quot;trachea&quot; is used to define a very different organ in invertebrates than in vertebrates. Insects have an open respiratory system made up of spiracles, tracheae, and tracheoles to transport metabolic gases to and from tissues.

== Structure ==
An adult&#x27;s trachea has an inner diameter of about and a length of about , wider in males than females. The trachea begins at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx at the level of sixth cervical vertebra (C6) and ends at the carina, the point where the trachea branches into left and right main bronchi., at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4), although its position may change with breathing. The trachea is surrounded by 16–20 rings of hyaline cartilage; these &#x27;rings&#x27; are 4 millimetres high in the adult, incomplete and C-shaped. Ligaments connect the rings. The trachealis muscle connects the ends of the incomplete rings and runs along the back wall of the trachea. Also adventitia, which is the outermost layer of connective tissue that surrounds the hyaline cartilage, contributes to the trachea&#x27;s ability to bend and stretch with movement.

Although trachea is a midline structure, it can be displaced normally to the right by the aortic arch.

=== Nearby structures ===
The trachea passes by many structures of the neck and chest (thorax) along its course.

In front of the upper trachea lies connective tissue and skin. Several other structures pass over or sit on the trachea; the jugular arch, which joins the two anterior jugular veins, sits in front of the upper part of the trachea. The sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles stretch along its length. The thyroid gland also stretches across the upper trachea, with the isthmus overlying the second to fourth rings, and the lobes stretching to the level of the fifth or sixth cartilage. The blood vessels of the thyroid rest on the trachea next to the isthmus; superior thyroid arteries join just above it, and the inferior thyroid veins below it. In front of the lower trachea lies the manubrium of the sternum, the remnants of the thymus in adults. To the front left lie the large blood vessels the aortic arch and its branches the left common carotid artery and the brachiocephalic trunk; and the left brachiocephalic vein. The deep cardiac plexus and lymph nodes are also positioned in front of the lower trachea.

Behind the trachea, along its length, sits the oesophagus, followed by connective tissue and the vertebral column. To its sides run the carotid arteries and inferior thyroid arteries; and to its sides on its back surface run the recurrent laryngeal nerves in the upper trachea, and the vagus nerves in the lower trachea.

The trachealis muscle contracts during coughing, reducing the size of the lumen of the trachea.

===Blood and lymphatic supply===
The upper part of trachea receives and drains blood through the inferior thyroid arteries and veins; the lower trachea receives blood from bronchial arteries. Arteries that supply the trachea do so via small branches that supply the trachea from the sides. As the branches approach the wall of the trachea, they split into inferior and superior branches, which join with the branches of the arteries above and below; these then split into branches that supply the anterior and posterior parts of the trachea. The inferior thyroid arteries arise just below the isthmus of the thyroid, which sits atop the trachea. These arteries join () with ascending branches of the bronchial arteries, which are direct branches from the aorta, to supply blood to the trachea. The lymphatic vessels of the trachea drain into the pretracheal nodes that lie in front of the trachea, and paratracheal lymph nodes that lie beside it.

===Development===
In the fourth week of development of the human embryo as the respiratory bud grows, the trachea separates from the foregut through the formation of ridges which eventually separate the trachea from the oesophagus, the tracheoesophageal septum. This separates the future trachea from the oesophagus and divides the foregut tube into the laryngotracheal tube. By the start of the fifth week, the left and right main bronchi have begun to form, initially as buds at the terminal end of the trachea.

The trachea is no more than 4 mm in diameter during the first year of life, expanding to its adult diameter of approximately 2 cm by late childhood. The trachea is more circular and more vertical in children compared to adults, varies more in size, and also varies more in its position in relation to its surrounding structures.

===Microanatomy===
The trachea is lined with a layer of interspersed layers of column-shaped cells with cilia. The epithelium contains goblet cells, which are glandular, column-shaped cells that produce mucins, the main component of mucus. Mucus helps to moisten and protect the airways. Mucus lines the ciliated cells of the trachea to trap inhaled foreign particles that the cilia then waft upward toward the larynx and then the pharynx where it can be either swallowed into the stomach or expelled as phlegm. This self-clearing mechanism is termed mucociliary clearance. Directly beneath this mucus layer lies the submucosa layer which is composed primarily of fibrous connective tissue and connects the mucosa to the rings of hyaline cartilage beneath.

The trachea is surrounded by 16 to 20 rings of hyaline cartilage; these &#x27;rings&#x27; are incomplete and C-shaped. Two or more of the cartilages often unite, partially or completely, and they are sometimes bifurcated at their extremities. The rings are generally highly elastic but they may calcify with age.

== Function ==
The trachea&#x27;s main function is to transport air to and from the lungs. It also helps to warm, humidify, and filter the air before it reaches the lungs.

The trachea is made up of rings of cartilage, which help to keep it open and prevent it from collapsing. The inside of the trachea is lined with a mucous membrane, which produces mucus to help trap dirt and dust particles. The cilia, which are tiny hairs that line the mucous membrane, help to move the mucus and trapped particles up and out of the trachea.

==Clinical significance==
===Inflammation and infection===

Inflammation of the trachea is known as tracheitis, usually due to an infection. It is usually caused by viral infections, with bacterial infections occurring almost entirely in children. Most commonly, infections occur with inflammation of other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the larynx and bronchi, known as croup, however bacterial infections may also affect the trachea alone, although they are often associated with a recent viral infection. Viruses that cause croup are generally the parainfluenza viruses 1–3, with influenza viruses A and B also causing croup, but usually causing more serious infections; bacteria may also cause croup and include &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;. Causes of bacterial infection of the trachea are most commonly &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;. In patients who are in hospital, additional bacteria that may cause tracheitis include &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, and &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;.
A person affected with tracheitis may start with symptoms that suggest an upper respiratory tract infection such as a cough, sore throat, or coryzal symptoms such as a runny nose. Fevers may develop and an affected child may develop difficulty breathing and sepsis. Swelling of the airway can cause narrowing of the airway, causing a hoarse breathing sound called stridor, or even cause complete blockage. Up to 80% of people affected by bacterial tracheitis require the use of mechanical ventilation, and treatment may include endoscopy for the purposes of acquiring microbiological specimens for culture and sensitivity, as well as removal of any dead tissue associated with the infection. Treatment in such situations usually includes antibiotics.

===Narrowing===
A trachea may be narrowed or compressed, usually a result of enlarged nearby lymph nodes; cancers of the trachea or nearby structures; large thyroid goitres; or rarely as a result of other processes such as unusually swollen blood vessels. Scarring from tracheobronchial injury or intubation; or inflammation associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis may also cause a narrowing of the trachea (tracheal stenosis). Obstruction invariably causes a harsh breathing sound known as stridor. A camera inserted via the mouth down into the trachea, called bronchoscopy, may be performed to investigate the cause of an obstruction. Management of obstructions depends on the cause. Obstructions as a result of malignancy may be managed with surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. A stent may be inserted over the obstruction. Benign lesions, such as narrowing resulting from scarring, are likely to be surgically excised.

One cause of narrowing is tracheomalacia, which is the tendency for the trachea to collapse when there is increased external pressure, such as when airflow is increased during breathing in or out, due to decreased compliance. It can be due to congenital causes, or due to things that develop after birth, such as compression from nearby masses or swelling, or trauma. Congenital tracheomalacia can occur by itself or in association with other abnormalities such as bronchomalacia or laryngomalacia, and abnormal connections between the trachea and the oesophagus, amongst others. Congenital tracheomalacia often improves without specific intervention; when required, interventions may include beta agonists and muscarinic agonists, which enhance the tone of the smooth muscle surrounding the trachea; positive pressure ventilation, or surgery, which may include the placement of a stent, or the removal of the affected part of the trachea. In dogs, particularly miniature dogs and toy dogs, tracheomalacia, as well as bronchomalacia, can lead to tracheal collapse, which often presents with a honking goose-like cough.

===Injury===
The trachea may be injured by trauma such as in a vehicle accident, or intentionally by another wilfully inflicting damage for example as practiced in some martial arts.

===Intubation===
Tracheal intubation refers to the insertion of a tube down the trachea. This procedure is commonly performed during surgery, in order to ensure a person receives enough oxygen when sedated. The catheter is connected to a machine that monitors the airflow, oxygenation and several other metrics. This is often one of the responsibilities of an anaesthetist during surgery.

In an emergency, or when tracheal intubation is deemed impossible, a tracheotomy is often performed to insert a tube for ventilation, usually when needed for particular types of surgery to be carried out so that the airway can be kept open. The provision of the opening via a tracheotomy is called a tracheostomy. Another method procedure can be carried, in an emergency situation, and this is a cricothyrotomy.

===Congenital disorders===
Tracheal agenesis is a rare birth defect in which the trachea fails to develop. The defect is usually fatal though sometimes surgical intervention has been successful.

A tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital defect in which the trachea and esophagus are abnormally connected (a ). This is because of abnormalities in the separation between the trachea and oesophagus during development. This occurs in approximately 1 in 3,000 births, and the most common abnormalities is a separation of the upper and lower ends of the oesophagus, with the upper end finishing in a closed pouch. Other abnormalities may be associated with this, including cardiac abnormalities, or VACTERL syndrome. Such fistulas may be detected before a baby is born because of excess amniotic fluid; after birth, they are often associated with pneumonitis and pneumonia because of of food contents. Congenital fistulas are often treated by surgical repair. In adults, fistulas may occur because of erosion into the trachea from nearby malignant tumours, which erode into both the trachea and the oesophagus. Initially, these often result in coughing from swallowed contents of the oesophagus that are aspirated through the trachea, often progressing to fatal pneumonia; there is rarely a curative treatment. A tracheo-oesophageal puncture is a surgically created hole between the trachea and the esophagus in a person who has had their larynx removed. Air travels upwards from the surgical connection to the upper oesophagus and the pharynx, creating vibrations that create sound that can be used for speech. The purpose of the puncture is to restore a person&#x27;s ability to speak after the vocal cords have been removed.

Sometimes as an anatomical variation one or more of the tracheal rings are formed as complete rings, rather than horseshoe shaped rings. These &quot;O&quot; rings are smaller than the normal C-shaped rings and can cause narrowing () of the trachea, resulting in breathing difficulties. An operation called a &quot;slide tracheoplasty&quot; can open up the rings and rejoin them as wider rings, shortening the length of the trachea. Slide tracheoplasty is said to be the best option in treating tracheal stenosis.

Mounier-Kuhn syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of an abnormally enlarged trachea, characterised by absent elastic fibres, smooth muscle thinning, and a tendency to get recurrent respiratory tract infections.

===Replacement===
From 2008, operations have experimentally replaced tracheas, with those grown from stem cells, or with synthetic substitutes, however this is regarded as experimental and there is no standardised method. Difficulties with ensuring adequate blood supply to the replaced trachea is considered a major challenge to any replacement. Additionally, no evidence has been found to support the placement of stem cells taken from bone marrow on the trachea as a way of stimulating tissue regeneration, and such a method remains hypothetical.

In January 2021, surgeons at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York performed the first complete trachea transplantation. The 18-hour procedure included harvesting a trachea from a donor and implanting it in the patient, connecting numerous veins and arteries to provide sufficient blood flow to the organ.

==Other animals==
Allowing for variations in the length of the neck, the trachea in other mammals is, in general, similar to that in humans. Generally, it is also similar to the reptilian trachea.

===Vertebrates===
In birds, the trachea runs from the pharynx to the syrinx, from which the primary bronchi diverge. Swans have an unusually elongated trachea, part of which is coiled beneath the sternum; this may act as a resonator to amplify sound. In some birds, the tracheal rings are complete, and may even be ossified.

In amphibians, the trachea is normally extremely short, and leads directly into the lungs, without clear primary bronchi. A longer trachea is, however, found in some long-necked salamanders, and in caecilians. While there are irregular cartilagenous nodules on the amphibian trachea, these do not form the rings found in amniotes.

The only vertebrates to have lungs, but no trachea, are the lungfish and the &quot;Polypterus&quot;, in which the lungs arise directly from the pharynx.

===Invertebrates===

The word &quot;trachea&quot; is used to define a very different organ in invertebrates than in vertebrates. Insects have an open respiratory system made up of spiracles, tracheae, and tracheoles to transport metabolic gases to and from tissues. The distribution of spiracles can vary greatly among the many orders of insects, but in general each segment of the body can have only one pair of spiracles, each of which connects to an atrium and has a relatively large tracheal tube behind it. The tracheae are invaginations of the cuticular exoskeleton that branch (anastomose) throughout the body with diameters from only a few micrometres up to 0.8 mm. Diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place across the walls of the smallest tubes, called tracheoles, which penetrate tissues and even indent individual cells. Gas may be conducted through the respiratory system by means of active ventilation or passive diffusion. Unlike vertebrates, insects do not generally carry oxygen in their hemolymph.
This is one of the factors that may limit their size.

A tracheal tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of taenidia in various geometries such as loops or helices. Taenidia provide strength and flexibility to the trachea. In the head, thorax, or abdomen, tracheae may also be connected to air sacs. Many insects, such as grasshoppers and bees, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are able to control the flow of air through their body. In some aquatic insects, the tracheae exchange gas through the body wall directly, in the form of a gill, or function essentially as normal, via a plastron. Note that despite being internal, the tracheae of arthropods are lined with cuticular tissue and are shed during moulting (ecdysis).

<text>The Jewish Autonomous Oblast (JAO) is a federal subject of Russia in the far east of the country, bordering Khabarovsk Krai and Amur Oblast in Russia and Heilongjiang province in China. Its administrative center is the town of Birobidzhan.

The JAO was designated by a Soviet official decree in 1928, and officially established in 1934. At its height, in the late 1940s, the Jewish population in the region peaked around 46,000–50,000, approximately 25% of its population. Since then the share of Jews steadily declined, and according to the 2021 Russian census, there were only 837 ethnic Jews left in the JAO (0.6%).

Article 65 of the Constitution of Russia provides that the JAO is Russia&#x27;s only autonomous oblast. It is one of two officially Jewish jurisdictions in the world, the other being Israel. It is one of the few places in the world where Yiddish is a recognized minority language.

== History ==

=== Background ===

==== Annexation of the Amur Region by Russia ====
Prior to 1858, the area of what is today the Jewish Autonomous Oblast was ruled by a succession of Chinese imperial dynasties. In 1858, the northern bank of the Amur River, including the territory of today&#x27;s Jewish Autonomous Oblast, was split away from the Qing Chinese territory of Manchuria and became incorporated into the Russian Empire pursuant to the Treaty of Aigun (1858) and the Convention of Peking (1860).

==== Military colonization ====
In December 1858, the Russian government authorized the formation of the Amur Cossack Host to protect the south-east boundary of Siberia and communications on the Amur and Ussuri rivers. This military colonization included settlers from Transbaikalia. Between 1858 and 1882, many settlements consisting of wooden houses were founded. It is estimated that as many as 40,000 men from the Russian military moved into the region.

Expeditions of scientists, including geographers, ethnographers, naturalists, and botanists such as Mikhail Ivanovich Venyukov, Leopold von Schrenck, Karl Maximovich, Gustav Radde, and Vladimir Leontyevich Komarov promoted research in the area.

==== Construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway ====

In 1899, construction began on the regional section of the Trans-Siberian Railway connecting Chita and Vladivostok. The project produced a large influx of new settlers and the foundation of new settlements. Between 1908 and 1912, stations opened at Volochayevka, Obluchye, Bira, Birakan, Londoko, In, and Tikhonkaya. The railway construction finished in October 1916 with the opening of the Khabarovsk Bridge across the Amur at Khabarovsk.

During this time, before the 1917 revolution, most local inhabitants were farmers. The only industrial enterprise was the Tungussky timber mill, although gold was mined in the Sutara River, and there were some small railway workshops.

==== Russian Civil War ====
In 1922, during the Russian Civil War, the territory of the future Jewish Autonomous Oblast became the scene of the Battle of Volochayevka.

==== Soviet policies regarding minorities and Jews ====
Although Judaism as a religion ran counter to the Bolshevik party&#x27;s policy of atheism and their crackdown on organized Jewish communities by closing synagogues and harassing believers, Vladimir Lenin also wanted to appease minority groups to gain their support and provide examples of tolerance.

In 1924, the unemployment rate among Jews exceeded 30 percent, as a result of USSR policies against private property ownership, which prohibited them from being craftspeople and small businessmen as many had been prior to the revolution. With the goal of getting Jews back to work to be more productive members of society, the government established Komzet, the committee for the agricultural settlement of Jews. The Soviet government entertained the idea of resettling all Jews in the USSR in a designated territory where they would be able to pursue a lifestyle that was &quot;socialist in content and national in form&quot;. The Russians also wanted to offer an alternative to Zionism, the establishment of the Mandate of Palestine as a Jewish homeland. Socialist Zionists such as Ber Borochov were gaining followers at that time, and Zionism was the favored ideology in the world&#x27;s political economy to the Yiddish interpretations, which were essentially incompatible with the USSR because of the Yiddish movement&#x27;s growing opposition (e.g. Emma Goldman) to the very ethno-nationalism which constituted and structured Soviet states.

Crimea was initially considered in the early 1920s, when it already had a significant Jewish population. Two Jewish districts () were formed in Crimea and three in south Ukraine. However, an alternative scheme, perceived as more advantageous, was put into practice.

=== Early history ===

==== Establishment ====
Eventually, Birobidzhan, in what is now the JAO, was chosen by the Soviet leadership as the site for the Jewish region. The choice of this area was a surprise to Komzet; the area had been chosen for military and economic reasons. This area was often infiltrated by China, while Japan also wanted Russia to lose the provinces of the Soviet Far East. At the time, there were only about 30,000 inhabitants in the area, mostly descendants of Trans-Baikal Cossacks resettled there by tsarist authorities, Koreans, Kazakhs, and the Tungusic peoples. The Soviet government wanted to increase settlement in the remote Russian Far East, especially along the vulnerable border with China. General Pavel Sudoplatov writes about the government&#x27;s rationale behind picking the area in the Far East: &quot;The establishment of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in Birobidzhan in 1928 was ordered by Stalin only as an effort to strengthen the Far Eastern border region with an outpost, not as a favour to the Jews. The area was constantly penetrated by Chinese and White Russian resistance groups, and the idea was to shield the territory by establishing a settlement whose inhabitants would be hostile to white Russian émigrés, especially the Cossacks. The status of this region was defined shrewdly as an autonomous district, not an autonomous republic, which meant that no local legislature, high court, or government post of ministerial rank was permitted. It was an autonomous area, but a bare frontier, not a political center.&quot;

On 28 March 1928, the Presidium of the General Executive Committee of the USSR passed the decree &quot;On the attaching for Komzet of free territory near the Amur River in the Russian Far East for settlement of the working Jews.&quot; The decree meant &quot;a possibility of establishment of a Jewish administrative territorial unit on the territory of said region&quot;.

The new territory was initially called the Birobidzhan Jewish National Raion.

Birobidzhan had a harsh geography and climate: it was mountainous, covered with virgin forests of oak, pine and cedar, and also swamplands, and any new settlers would have to build their lives from scratch. To make colonization more enticing, the Soviet government allowed private land ownership. This led to many non-Jews settling in the oblast to get a free farm.

In the spring of 1928, 654 Jews arrived to settle in the area; however, by October 1928, 49.7% of them had left because of the severe conditions. In the summer of 1928, there were torrential rains that flooded the crops and an outbreak of anthrax that killed the cattle.

On 7 May 1934, the Presidium of the General Executive Committee accepted the decree on its transformation into the Jewish Autonomous Region within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In 1938, with the formation of the Khabarovsk Territory, the Jewish Autonomous Region (JAR) was included in its structure.

==== Growth of Jewish communities in the early 1930s ====
In the 1930s, a Soviet promotional campaign was created to entice more Jewish settlers to move there. The campaign partly incorporated the standard Soviet promotional tools of the era, including posters and Yiddish-language novels describing a socialist utopia there. In one instance, leaflets promoting Birobidzhan were dropped from an airplane over a Jewish neighborhood in Belarus. In another instance, a government-produced Yiddish film called &quot;Seekers of Happiness&quot; told the story of a Jewish family from overseas making a new life for itself in Birobidzhan.

Early Jewish settlements included Valdgeym, dating from 1928, which included the first collective farm established in the oblast, Amurzet, which was the center of Jewish settlement south of Birobidzhan from 1929 to 1939, and Smidovich.

The Organization for Jewish Colonisation in the Soviet Union, a Jewish Communist organization in North America, successfully encouraged the immigration of some US residents, such as the family of the future spy George Koval, which arrived in 1932. Some 1,200 non-Soviet Jews chose to settle in Birobidzhan.

As the Jewish population grew, so did the impact of Yiddish culture on the region. The settlers established a Yiddish newspaper, the &quot;Birobidzhaner Shtern&quot;; a theatre troupe was created; and streets being built in the new city were named after prominent Yiddish authors such as Sholom Aleichem and I. L. Peretz.

==== Stalin era and World War II ====
The Jewish population of JAO reached a pre-war peak of 20,000 in 1937. According to the 1939 population census, 17,695 Jews lived in the region (16% of the total population).

After the war ended in 1945, there was renewed interest in the idea of Birobidzhan as a potential home for Jewish refugees. The Jewish population in the region peaked at around 46,000–50,000 Jews in 1948, around 25% of the entire population of the JAO.

==== Cold War ====
The census of 1959 found that the Jewish population of the JAO had declined by approximately 50%, down to 14,269 persons.

A synagogue was opened at the end of World War II, but it closed in the mid-1960s after a fire left it severely damaged.

In 1980, a Yiddish school was opened in Valdgeym.

In 1987, the reformist Soviet government led by Mikhail Gorbachev pardoned many political prisoners and told the American Jewish community that it would allow the emigration of 11,000 Jewish refuseniks. According to the 1989 Soviet Census, there were 8,887 Jews living in the JAO, or 4% of the total JAO population of 214,085.

=== Post-Soviet history ===

In 1991, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast became the federal subject of Russia and thus was no longer subordinated to Khabarovsk Krai. However, by that time, most of the Jews had emigrated from the Soviet Union and the remaining Jews constituted fewer than 2% of the local population. In early 1996, 872 people, or 20% of the Jewish population at that time, emigrated to Tel Aviv via chartered flights. As of 2002, 2,357 Jews were living in the JAO. A 2004 article stated that the number of Jews in the region &quot;was now growing&quot;. As of 2005, Amurzet had a small active Jewish community. An April 2007 article in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; claimed that the Jewish population had grown to about 4,000. The article cited Mordechai Scheiner, the Chief Rabbi of the JAO from 2002 to 2011, who said that, at the time the article was published, Jewish culture was enjoying a religious and cultural resurgence. By 2010, according to data provided by the Russian Census Bureau, there were only approximately 1,600 people of Jewish descent remaining in the JAO (1% of the total population), while ethnic Russians made up 93% of the JAO population.

According to an article published in 2000, Birobidzhan has several state-run schools that teach Yiddish, a Yiddish school for religious instruction and a kindergarten. The five- to seven-year-olds spend two lessons a week learning to speak Yiddish, as well as being taught Jewish songs, dance, and traditions. A 2006 article in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; stated that Yiddish is taught in the schools, a Yiddish radio station is in operation, and the &quot;Birobidzhaner Shtern&quot; newspaper includes a section in Yiddish.
In 2002, &quot;L&#x27;Chayim, Comrade Stalin!&quot;, a documentary on Stalin&#x27;s creation of the Jewish Autonomous Region and its settlement, was released by The Cinema Guild. In addition to being a history of the creation of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, the film features scenes of contemporary Birobidzhan and interviews with Jewish residents.

According to an article published in 2010, Yiddish is the language of instruction in only one of Birobidzhan&#x27;s 14 public schools. Two schools, representing a quarter of the city&#x27;s students, offer compulsory Yiddish classes for children aged 6 to 10.

As of 2012, the &quot;Birobidzhaner Shtern&quot; continues to publish 2 or 3 pages per week in Yiddish and one local elementary school still teaches Yiddish.

According to a 2012 article, &quot;only a very small minority, mostly seniors, speak Yiddish&quot;, a new Chabad-sponsored synagogue opened at the 14a Sholom-Aleichem Street, and the Sholem Aleichem Amur State University offers a Yiddish course.

According to a 2015 article, kosher meat arrives by train from Moscow every few weeks, a Sunday school functions, and there is also a minyan on Friday night and Shabbat.

A November 2017 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, titled, &quot;Revival of a Soviet Zion: Birobidzhan celebrates its Jewish heritage&quot;, examined the current status of the city and suggested that, even though the Jewish Autonomous Region in Russia&#x27;s far east is now barely 1% Jewish, officials hope to woo back people who left after Soviet collapse.

==== 2013 proposals to merge the JAO with adjoining regions ====
In 2013, there were proposals to merge the JAO with Khabarovsk Krai or with Amur Oblast. The proposals led to protests, and were rejected by residents, as well as the Jewish community of Russia. There were also questions as to whether a merger would be allowed pursuant to the Constitution of Russia and whether a merger would require a national referendum.

== Culture ==
JAO and its history have been portrayed in the documentary film &quot;L&#x27;Chayim, Comrade Stalin!&quot;. Released in 2002, the film tells the story of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s creation of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast and its partial settlement by thousands of Russian and Yiddish speaking Jews. As well as relating the history of the creation of the proposed Jewish homeland, the film features scenes of life in contemporary Birobidzhan and interviews with Jewish residents.

The southern and eastern section is part of the Amur valley, with only a few small residual ridges.

=== Climate ===
The territory has a monsoonal/anticyclonic climate, with warm, wet, humid summers due to the influence of the East Asian monsoon, and cold, dry, windy conditions prevailing in the winter months courtesy of the Siberian high-pressure system.

Nonferrous metallurgy, engineering, metalworking, and the building material, forest, woodworking, light industrial, and food industries are the most highly developed industrial sectors.

Agriculture is the Jewish Autonomous Oblast&#x27;s main economic sector owing to fertile soils and a moist climate.

The largest companies in the region include Kimkano–Sutarsky Mining and Processing Plant (with revenues of $ million in 2017), Teploozersky Cement Plant ($ million) and Brider Trading House ($ million).

=== Transportation ===
The region&#x27;s well-developed transportation network consists of of railways, including the Tsarist-era Trans-Siberian Railway; of waterways along the Amur and Tunguska rivers; and of roads, including of paved roads. The most important road is the Khabarovsk-Birobidzhan-Obluchye-Amur Region highway with ferry service across the Amur. The Birobidzhan Yuzhniy Airfield, in the center of the region, connects Birobidzhan with Khabarovsk and outlying district centers.

==== Tongjiang-Nizhneleninskoye railway bridge ====

The Tongjiang-Nizhneleninskoye railway bridge is a long, $355 million bridge that links Nizhneleninskoye in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast with Tongjiang in the Heilongjiang Province of China. The bridge opened in 2021 and transports more than of cargo and 1.5 million passengers per year.

===Ethnic groups===
In the late 1940s, the Jewish population in the region peaked around 46,000–50,000, approximately 25% of its population. The census of 1959 found that the Jewish population of the JAO had declined by approximately 50%, down to 14,269 persons. In 1987, the reformist Soviet government led by Mikhail Gorbachev pardoned many political prisoners and told the American Jewish community that it would allow the emigration of 11,000 Jewish refuseniks. According to the 1989 Soviet Census, there were 8,887 Jews living in the JAO, or 4% of the total JAO population of 214,085. In 1991, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast became the federal subject of Russia and thus was no longer subordinated to Khabarovsk Krai. However, by that time, most of the Jews had emigrated from the Soviet Union and the remaining Jews constituted fewer than 2% of the local population. In early 1996, 872 people, or 20% of the Jewish population at that time, emigrated to Israel. As of 2002, 2,357 Jews were living in the JAO. A 2004 article stated that the number of Jews in the region &quot;was now growing&quot;. An April 2007 article in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; claimed that the Jewish population had grown to about 4,000. The article cited Mordechai Scheiner, the Chief Rabbi of the JAO from 2002 to 2011, who said that, at the time the article was published, Jewish culture was enjoying a religious and cultural resurgence. However, the 2021 Russian census indicated (see the table above) a population of only 837 ethnic Jews, or 0.6% of the JAO population were Jewish.

In the Soviet Union there was an attempt to make Yiddish an official language within Birobidzhan.
According to the statute of JAO (1997), Yiddish is one of the recognized minority languages.

Yiddish is taught in three of the region&#x27;s schools, but the community is almost exclusively Russian-speaking.

According to an article published in 2000, Birobidzhan has several state-run schools that teach Yiddish, a Yiddish school for religious instruction and a kindergarten. The five- to seven-year-olds spend two lessons a week learning to speak Yiddish, as well as being taught Jewish songs, dance, and traditions. A 2006 article in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; stated that Yiddish is taught in the schools, a Yiddish radio station is in operation, and the &quot;Birobidzhaner Shtern&quot; newspaper includes a section in Yiddish.

According to a 2012 survey, 23% of the population of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast adhere to Russian Orthodoxy, 6% are Orthodox Christians of other church jurisdictions or Orthodox believers who are not members of any church, and 9% are unaffiliated or generic Christians. Judaism, despite being the associated religion of the oblast&#x27;s titular ethnoreligious group, is practiced by just 1% of the population, which is only slightly higher than the national average and is close to that of communities in other federal subjects. In addition, 35% of the population identify as &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, and 22% profess atheism, making the Jewish Autonomous Oblast one of the least religious regions in Russia. A total of 5% of the population follows other religions or declined to answer the question.

<text>Birobidzhan (; , ), also spelt Birobijan ( ), is a town and the administrative centre of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, Russia, located on the Trans-Siberian Railway, near the China–Russia border.

As of the 2010 Census, its population is 75,413, and its official language is Yiddish. Birobidzhan is named after the two largest rivers in the autonomous oblast: the Bira and the Bidzhan. The Bira, which lies to the east of the Bidzhan Valley, flows through the town. Both rivers are tributaries of the Amur.

==History==

Built on the site of an earlier village called Tikhonka, Birobidzhan was planned by the Swiss architect Hannes Meyer, and established in 1931. It became the administrative centre of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in 1934, and town status was granted to it in 1937. The 36,000 km2 of Birobidzhan were approved by the Politburo on March 28, 1928. After the Bolshevik revolution, the Soviet government set up two organisations that worked with the settlement of Jews into Birobidzhan, the KOMZET and OZET. These organisations were responsible for the distribution of land as well as domestic responsibilities, ranging from moving to medical assistance. Many Jewish Canadians then gave their support to the Soviet Union by becoming either members or sympathisers with the Communist Party of Canada.

Jewish communists believed that the Soviet Union&#x27;s creation of Birobidzhan was the &quot;only true and sensible solution to the national question.&quot; The Soviet government used the slogan &quot;To the Jewish Homeland!&quot; to encourage Jewish workers to move to Birobidzhan. The slogan proved successful in convincing Soviet Jews as well as Jews from other countries to move to the city. In 1935, Ambijan received permission from the Soviet government to aid Jewish families travelling to Birobidzhan from Poland, Romania, Lithuania and Germany. Jewish workers and engineers travelled to Birobidzhan from Argentina and the United States as well. This campaign by the Soviet government was known as the Birobidzhan Experiment.

===Factors behind the Birobidzhan Experiment===
Although Birobidzhan was meant to serve as a home for the Jewish population, the authorities struggled to turn the idea into a reality. There were no important cultural connections between the land and the Jewish settlers. The growing population was culturally diverse, with some settlers focused on being modern Russian citizens, some disillusioned by modern cultures with a desire to work the land and promote socialist ideals, with few interested in establishing a cultural homeland. Ulterior motives generated by the Soviet government were the primary reasons for Jewish people to relocate to Birobidzhan. The placement of the Jews in Birobidzhan was meant to serve as a buffer to dissuade any Chinese or Japanese expansion. The region was also a link between the Trans-Siberian Railroad and the Amur River Valley, and the Soviet government sought to exploit the natural resources of the area, such as fish, timber, iron, tin, and gold.

===Complications during the Experiment===
Before the Russian Revolution of 1917, residence for Jews was restricted to the Pale of Settlement. As Jews relocated to Birobidzhan, they had to compete with the approximately 27,000 Russians, Cossacks, Koreans, and Ukrainians already residing there for property and land to develop new homes. This complicated the transition for the Jewish population, as there was no significant area to claim as their own.

Logistically and practically, settling Birobidzhan proved to be difficult. Due to inadequate infrastructure and weather conditions of the area, more than half the Jewish settlers who relocated to Birobidzhan after the initial settlement did not remain.

When the Stalinist purges began, shortly after the creation of Birobidzhan, Jews there were targeted. Following World War II, tens of thousands of displaced Eastern European Jews found their way to Birobidzhan from 1946 to 1948. Some were Ukrainian and Belarusian Jews who were not allowed to return to their original homes. However, Jews were once again targeted in the wake of World War II when Joseph Stalin embarked on a campaign against &quot;rootless cosmopolitans&quot;. Nearly all the Yiddish institutions of Birobidzhan were liquidated.

===Notable supporters of Birobidzhan===

Among Birobidzhan&#x27;s proponents was Dudley Aman, 1st Baron Marley. After Lord Marley met Peter Smidovich and Jacob Tsegelnitski in August 1932, Marley became a proponent of Birobidzhan as a new homeland for Jewish workers and refugees. His visit to Birobidzhan in October 1933 was organised by Smidovich himself. Marley&#x27;s assessment of the area was positive, and he became a more avid supporter of the settlement of Birobidzhan.

Yiddish writer David Bergelson played a large part in promoting Birobidzhan, although he himself did not settle there permanently. Bergelson wrote articles in the Yiddish language newspapers in other countries extolling the region as an ideal escape from antisemitism elsewhere. At least 1,000 families from the United States and Latin America came to Birobidzhan because of Bergelson. On his 68th birthday in 1952, Bergelson was among those executed during Stalin&#x27;s antisemitic campaign against &quot;rootless cosmopolitans&quot; following the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.

In the Russian language play &quot;Novaia rodina&quot; (&quot;New Homeland&quot;) by the Soviet playwright Victor Fink celebrated Birobidzhan as the coming together of three communities - the Koreans, the Amur Cossacks and the Jews. Each community has its own good and bad characters, but ultimately the good characters from each community learnt to cooperate and work with each other. To symbolise the unity achieved, the play ends with mixed marriages with one Jewish character marrying a Korean, another Jewish character marrying a Cossack and a Cossack marrying a Korean. Likewise, the Soviet Yiddish writer Emmanuil Kazakevich portrayed in a poem the achievement of Birobidzhan being declared the Jewish Autonomous Region on 7 May 1934 as an inter-communal event with the members of the Amur Cossack Host coming out to join the celebrations. Kazkevich&#x27;s poem had a basis in reality as many members of the Amur Cossack Host hoped that Birobidzhan signalled Soviet interest in the neglected region along the banks of the Amur river.

Canadian Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson was vice president of Ambijan, or the &quot;American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan,&quot; which was a supplementary group that was combined with ICOR in 1946. His support of Birobidzhan as a new homeland for Jewish families consisted of appearing at meetings in support of the relocation of Jews to Birobidzhan as well as advocating for families who truly wished to travel rather than those who were the most suited for the journey.

==Jewish and Yiddish culture==

The Russian Empire had the largest Jewish population in the world in the 19th and early 20th centuries and the majority of them were Ashkenazi Jews. Large numbers of them remained even after 2 million of them departed for other countries prior to the formation of the Soviet Union. While thousands of Jews migrated to Birobidzhan, the hardship and isolation caused most to leave. In 1939 the Jewish population made up less than twenty percent of the overall population. Shortly after World War II, the Jewish population in the region reached its peak of about 30,000. As of the mid-2010s, only about 2,000 Jews remain in the region, making up about one half of a percent of the population.

Yiddish, at that time widely regarded as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Jewish community, was meant to help integrate the Jewish population into the Soviet population. The language would ensure &#x27;national in form, socialist in content&#x27; was being followed by the Soviet Jewry. Many government officials in the Kremlin were under the impression that Birobidzhan was to become the new centre for Soviet Jewish life, which is why Jewish migration to Birobidzhan was strongly pushed during the 1920s.

The Jewish religious community in Birobidzhan was officially registered in 1946. The religious community suffered persecution in the early 1950s. Jewish culture was revived in Birobidzhan much earlier than elsewhere in the Soviet Union. Yiddish theaters opened in the 1970s. Since the early 1990s, Yiddish and Jewish traditions were required components in all public schools, taught not as Jewish exotica but as part of the region&#x27;s national heritage. The orthodox synagogue, completed in 2004, is next to a complex housing Sunday School classrooms, a library, a museum, and administrative offices. The buildings were officially opened in 2004 to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast.

According to Israeli Rabbi Mordechai Scheiner, the former Chief Rabbi of Birobidzhan and Chabad Lubavitch representative to the region, &quot;Today one can enjoy the benefits of the Yiddish culture and not be afraid to return to their Jewish traditions. It&#x27;s safe without any anti-Semitism, and we plan to open the first Jewish day school here.&quot; Scheiner also hosted the Russian television show, &quot;Yiddishkeit&quot; in the region. His student, actually born in Birobidzhan, Rabbi Eliyahu Riss, has taken over the reins since 2010.

The orthodox synagogue opened in 2004. Rabbi Scheiner says there are 4,000 Jews in Birobidzhan, just over 5 percent of the town&#x27;s population of 75,000. The Birobidzhan Jewish community was led by Lev Toitman, until his death in September, 2007.

Concerning the Jewish community of the oblast, Governor Nikolay Mikhaylovich Volkov has stated that he intends to &quot;support every valuable initiative maintained by our local Jewish organizations&quot;. In 2007, the Birobidzhan International Summer Program for Yiddish Language and Culture was launched by Yiddish studies professor Boris Kotlerman of Bar-Ilan University. The town&#x27;s main street is named after the Yiddish language author and humorist Sholem Aleichem.

For the Chanukah celebration of 2007, officials of Birobidzhan in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast claimed to have built the world&#x27;s largest menorah. A November 2017 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, titled, &quot;Revival of a Soviet Zion: Birobidzhan celebrates its Jewish heritage&quot;, examined the current status of the city and suggested that, even though the Jewish Autonomous Region in Russia&#x27;s far east is now barely 1% Jewish, officials hope to woo back people who left after Soviet collapse.

Rabbi Eli Riss has set out to return the Jewish culture to the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. The current slogan is &quot;make Birobidzhan Jewish again&quot;. The people want this to include teaching Yiddish in the school systems again as well as celebrating the variety of Jewish holidays. Riss&#x27; parents were originally residents of Birobidzhan, but moved to Israel in the 90&#x27;s along with a large majority of the Jewish population from the Oblast. He came back as the Chief Rabbi with plans of reinvigorating the Jewish culture. There are already plans for a kosher restaurant, supermarket, and mikveh. Riss is trying to make Birobidzhan a &#x27;safe place for Jews&#x27; and has already stated that it is one of the few places he has been where he has not experienced any antisemitism.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Birobidzhan is the administrative center of the autonomous oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Birobidzhansky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Birobidzhan—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Birobidzhan is incorporated as Birobidzhan Urban Okrug.

==Economy, infrastructure and transportation==
The chief economic activity is light industry, including textile and footwear. The city also has a vehicle repair factory, a furniture factory, a quicklime production factory, and several foodstuff factories. Khabarovsk is the closest major city to Birobidzhan and provides the closest major airport access to it, which is Khabarovsk Novy Airport (KHV / UHHH), 198 km from the center of Birobidzhan.

==Education==
The Sholem Aleichem Amur State University works in cooperation with the local religious community. The university is unique in the Russian Far East. The basis of the training course is study of the Hebrew language, history and classic Jewish texts. The town now boasts several state-run schools that teach Yiddish, as well as an Anglo-Yiddish faculty at its higher education college, a Yiddish school for religious instruction and a kindergarten. The five- to seven-year-olds spend two lessons a week learning to speak Yiddish, as well as being taught Jewish songs, dance and traditions. It is a public school that offers a half-day Yiddish and Jewish curriculum for those parents who choose it. About half the school&#x27;s 120 pupils are enrolled in the Yiddish course. Many of them continue on to Public School No. 2, which offers the same half-day Yiddish/Jewish curriculum from first through 12th grade. Yiddish is also offered at Birobidzhan&#x27;s Pedagogical Institute, one of the only university-level Yiddish courses in the country. Today, the town&#x27;s fourteen public schools must teach Yiddish and Jewish tradition.

==Climate==

Birobidzhan experiences a harsh, monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dwb&quot;) that is typified by very large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and severely cold (and dry) winters. January has never had an above-freezing temperature.
==Sports==
The bandy club Nadezhda has been playing in the 2nd highest division, the Russian Bandy Supreme League, until the 2016–17 season. However, in 2017–18 the team did not play in the league.

<text>The Texas League is a Minor League Baseball league which has operated in the South Central United States since 1902. It is classified as a Double-A league. Despite the league&#x27;s name, only its five South Division teams are actually based in the state of Texas; the five North Division teams are located in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. The league temporarily operated for the 2021 season as Double-A Central before reassuming its original moniker in 2022. 

The Texas League was founded in 1902, although it traces its lineage back to a predecessor founded in 1888.

==History==
===20th century===
The league was founded in 1888 and ran through 1892. It was refounded in 1895 and ran through 1899 (under the name Texas Association in 1895 and Texas-Southern League in 1896).

The Texas League was revived as a Class D league in 1902, moved to Class C in 1904 where it played through 1910 (except for 1906 as Class D again), played at Class B until 1920, and finally moved up to Class A in 1921. The Texas League, like many others, shut down during World War II. From 1959 to 1961, the Texas League and the Mexican League formed the Pan American Association. The two leagues played a limited interlocking schedule and post-season championship. By 1971, the Texas League and the Southern League had both decreased to seven teams. They played an interlocking schedule with the Southern League known as the Dixie Association. The two leagues played separate playoffs. The Texas League has operated its own schedule since 1972.

The term &quot;Texas Leaguer&quot; to describe a bloop hit, a soft fly ball that falls for a hit beyond the infielders&#x27; reach but too short for the outfielders to catch, has been extant since at least 1903 and was common throughout American baseball in the 20th century and to some degree into the 21st. The source of the idiom is not known but among other theories has been attributed to Ollie Pickering&#x27;s feat in a Texas League game of April 4, 1901, in which he made seven such hits in succession. Talk of this singular feat is supposed to have spread widely, bringing the term with it.

===21st century===
Around the advent of the 21st century, the Texas League witnessed a great deal of change. Teams once known as the Jackson Mets, El Paso Diablos, Shreveport Captains, and Wichita Wranglers all relocated to new cities and bigger stadiums.

In 2019, the San Antonio Missions relocated to Amarillo, Texas, becoming the Amarillo Sod Poodles. At the same time, the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) moved to San Antonio to continue on as the Missions at the Triple-A level.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the Texas League was temporarily renamed to &quot;Double-A Central&quot; for the 2021 season. Following MLB&#x27;s acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, the league switched back to its historical name beginning with the 2022 season.

==Texas League timeline==
 

* In 1971, the Southern League and Texas League were each down to seven teams, so they formed the Dixie Association for one season. They played interlocking schedules but held their own separate playoffs.

* The Wichita Wind Surge were originally slated to begin play in 2020 in the Pacific Coast League as the Triple-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins. However, the cancellation of the 2020 season and the 2021 realignment of the minor leagues resulted in Wichita dropping to Double-A without playing a Triple-A game.
