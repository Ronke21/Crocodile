<text>A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three-term controller) is a feedback-based control loop mechanism commonly used to manage machines and processes that require continuous control and automatic adjustment. It is typically used in industrial control systems and various other applications where constant control through modulation is necessary without human intervention. The PID controller automatically compares the desired target value (setpoint or SP) with the actual value of the system (process variable or PV). The difference between these two values is called the &quot;error value&quot;, denoted as formula_1.

It then applies corrective actions automatically to bring the PV to the same value as the SP using three methods: The proportional () component responds to the current error value by producing an output that is directly proportional to the magnitude of the error. This provides immediate correction based on how far the system is from the desired setpoint. The integral () component, in turn, considers the cumulative sum of past errors to address any residual steady-state errors that persist over time, eliminating lingering discrepancies. Lastly, the derivative () component predicts future error by assessing the rate of change of the error, which helps to mitigate overshoot and enhance system stability, particularly when the system undergoes rapid changes. The PID controller reduces the likelihood of human error and improves automation.

A common example is a vehicle’s cruise control system. When a vehicle encounters a hill, its speed may decrease due to constant engine power. The PID controller adjusts the engine&#x27;s power output to restore the vehicle to its desired speed, doing so efficiently with minimal delay and overshoot.

The theoretical foundation of PID controllers dates back to the early 1920s with the development of automatic steering systems for ships. This concept was later adopted for automatic process control in manufacturing, first appearing in pneumatic actuators and evolving into electronic controllers. PID controllers are widely used in numerous applications requiring accurate, stable, and optimized automatic control, such as temperature regulation, motor speed control, and industrial process management.

==Fundamental operation==

The distinguishing feature of the PID controller is the ability to use the three &quot;control terms&quot; of proportional, integral and derivative influence on the controller output to apply accurate and optimal control. The block diagram on the right shows the principles of how these terms are generated and applied. It shows a PID controller, which continuously calculates an &quot;error value&quot; formula_1 as the difference between a desired setpoint formula_3 and a measured process variable formula_4: formula_5, and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. The controller attempts to minimize the error over time by adjustment of a &quot;control variable&quot; formula_6, such as the opening of a control valve, to a new value determined by a weighted sum of the control terms.

In this model:
* Term P is proportional to the current value of the SP − PV error formula_1. For example, if the error is large, the control output will be proportionately large by using the gain factor &quot;Kp&quot;. Using proportional control alone will result in an error between the set point and the process value because the controller requires an error to generate the proportional output response. In steady state process conditions an equilibrium is reached, with a steady SP-PV &quot;offset&quot;. 
* Term I accounts for past values of the SP − PV error and integrates them over time to produce the I term. For example, if there is a residual SP − PV error after the application of proportional control, the integral term seeks to eliminate the residual error by adding a control effect due to the historic cumulative value of the error. When the error is eliminated, the integral term will cease to grow. This will result in the proportional effect diminishing as the error decreases, but this is compensated for by the growing integral effect.
* Term D is a best estimate of the future trend of the SP − PV error, based on its current rate of change. It is sometimes called &quot;anticipatory control&quot;, as it is effectively seeking to reduce the effect of the SP − PV error by exerting a control influence generated by the rate of error change. The more rapid the change, the greater the controlling or damping effect.

Tuning – The balance of these effects is achieved by loop tuning to produce the optimal control function. The tuning constants are shown below as &quot;K&quot; and must be derived for each control application, as they depend on the response characteristics of the physical system, external to the controller. These are dependent on the behavior of the measuring sensor, the final control element (such as a control valve), any control signal delays, and the process itself. Approximate values of constants can usually be initially entered knowing the type of application, but they are normally refined, or tuned, by introducing a setpoint change and observing the system response.

Control action – The mathematical model and practical loop above both use a &quot;direct&quot; control action for all the terms, which means an increasing positive error results in an increasing positive control output correction. This is because the &quot;error&quot; term is not the deviation from the setpoint (actual-desired) but is in fact the correction needed (desired-actual). The system is called &quot;reverse&quot; acting if it is necessary to apply negative corrective action. For instance, if the valve in the flow loop was 100–0% valve opening for 0–100% control output – meaning that the controller action has to be reversed. Some process control schemes and final control elements require this reverse action. An example would be a valve for cooling water, where the fail-safe mode, in the case of signal loss, would be 100% opening of the valve; therefore 0% controller output needs to cause 100% valve opening.

===Control function===
The overall control function is

:formula_8

where formula_9, formula_10, and formula_11, all non-negative, denote the coefficients for the proportional, integral, and derivative terms respectively (sometimes denoted &quot;P&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;).

===Standard form===
In the &quot;standard form&quot; of the equation (see later in article), formula_10 and formula_11 are respectively replaced by formula_14 and formula_15; the advantage of this being that formula_16 and formula_17 have some understandable physical meaning, as they represent an integration time and a derivative time respectively. formula_15 is the time constant with which the controller will attempt to approach the set point. formula_14 determines how long the controller will tolerate the output being consistently above or below the set point.

:formula_20

where

:formula_21 is the integration time constant, and

:formula_22 is the derivative time constant.

===Selective use of control terms===
Although a PID controller has three control terms, some applications need only one or two terms to provide appropriate control. This is achieved by setting the unused parameters to zero and is called a PI, PD, P, or I controller in the absence of the other control actions. PI controllers are fairly common in applications where derivative action would be sensitive to measurement noise, but the integral term is often needed for the system to reach its target value.

===Applicability===
The use of the PID algorithm does not guarantee optimal control of the system or its control stability . Situations may occur where there are excessive delays: the measurement of the process value is delayed, or the control action does not apply quickly enough. In these cases lead–lag compensation is required to be effective. The response of the controller can be described in terms of its responsiveness to an error, the degree to which the system overshoots a setpoint, and the degree of any system oscillation. But the PID controller is broadly applicable since it relies only on the response of the measured process variable, not on knowledge or a model of the underlying process.

==History==

===Origins===
Continuous control, before PID controllers were fully understood and implemented, has one of its origins in the centrifugal governor, which uses rotating weights to control a process. This was invented by Christiaan Huygens in the 17th century to regulate the gap between millstones in windmills depending on the speed of rotation, and thereby compensate for the variable speed of grain feed.

With the invention of the low-pressure stationary steam engine there was a need for automatic speed control, and James Watt&#x27;s self-designed &quot;conical pendulum&quot; governor, a set of revolving steel balls attached to a vertical spindle by link arms, came to be an industry standard. This was based on the millstone-gap control concept.

Rotating-governor speed control, however, was still variable under conditions of varying load, where the shortcoming of what is now known as proportional control alone was evident. The error between the desired speed and the actual speed would increase with increasing load. In the 19th century, the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by James Clerk Maxwell in 1868 in his now-famous paper &quot;On Governors&quot;. He explored the mathematical basis for control stability, and progressed a good way towards a solution, but made an appeal for mathematicians to examine the problem. The problem was examined further in 1874 by Edward Routh, Charles Sturm, and in 1895, Adolf Hurwitz, all of whom contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria.
In subsequent applications, speed governors were further refined, notably by American scientist Willard Gibbs, who in 1872 theoretically analyzed Watt&#x27;s conical pendulum governor.

About this time, the invention of the Whitehead torpedo posed a control problem that required accurate control of the running depth. Use of a depth pressure sensor alone proved inadequate, and a pendulum that measured the fore and aft pitch of the torpedo was combined with depth measurement to become the pendulum-and-hydrostat control. Pressure control provided only a proportional control that, if the control gain was too high, would become unstable and go into overshoot with considerable instability of depth-holding. The pendulum added what is now known as derivative control, which damped the oscillations by detecting the torpedo dive/climb angle and thereby the rate-of-change of depth. This development (named by Whitehead as &quot;The Secret&quot; to give no clue to its action) was around 1868.

Another early example of a PID-type controller was developed by Elmer Sperry in 1911 for ship steering, though his work was intuitive rather than mathematically-based.

It was not until 1922, however, that a formal control law for what we now call PID or three-term control was first developed using theoretical analysis, by Russian American engineer Nicolas Minorsky. Minorsky was researching and designing automatic ship steering for the US Navy and based his analysis on observations of a helmsman. He noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error but also on past error, as well as the current rate of change; this was then given a mathematical treatment by Minorsky.
His goal was stability, not general control, which simplified the problem significantly. While proportional control provided stability against small disturbances, it was insufficient for dealing with a steady disturbance, notably a stiff gale (due to steady-state error), which required adding the integral term. Finally, the derivative term was added to improve stability and control.

Trials were carried out on the USS &quot;New Mexico&quot;, with the controllers controlling the &quot;angular velocity&quot; (not the angle) of the rudder. PI control yielded sustained yaw (angular error) of ±2°. Adding the D element yielded a yaw error of ±1/6°, better than most helmsmen could achieve.

The Navy ultimately did not adopt the system due to resistance by personnel. Similar work was carried out and published by several others in the 1930s.

===Industrial control===

The wide use of feedback controllers did not become feasible until the development of wideband high-gain amplifiers to use the concept of negative feedback. This had been developed in telephone engineering electronics by Harold Black in the late 1920s, but not published until 1934. Independently, Clesson E Mason of the Foxboro Company in 1930 invented a wide-band pneumatic controller by combining the nozzle and flapper high-gain pneumatic amplifier, which had been invented in 1914, with negative feedback from the controller output. This dramatically increased the linear range of operation of the nozzle and flapper amplifier, and integral control could also be added by the use of a precision bleed valve and a bellows generating the integral term. The result was the &quot;Stabilog&quot; controller which gave both proportional and integral functions using feedback bellows. The integral term was called &quot;Reset&quot;. Later the derivative term was added by a further bellows and adjustable orifice.

From about 1932 onwards, the use of wideband pneumatic controllers increased rapidly in a variety of control applications. Air pressure was used for generating the controller output, and also for powering process modulating devices such as diaphragm-operated control valves. They were simple low maintenance devices that operated well in harsh industrial environments and did not present explosion risks in hazardous locations. They were the industry standard for many decades until the advent of discrete electronic controllers and distributed control systems (DCSs).

With these controllers, a pneumatic industry signaling standard of was established, which had an elevated zero to ensure devices were working within their linear characteristic and represented the control range of 0-100%.

In the 1950s, when high gain electronic amplifiers became cheap and reliable, electronic PID controllers became popular, and the pneumatic standard was emulated by 10-50 mA and 4–20 mA current loop signals (the latter became the industry standard). Pneumatic field actuators are still widely used because of the advantages of pneumatic energy for control valves in process plant environments.

Most modern PID controls in industry are implemented as computer software in DCSs, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), or discrete compact controllers.

===Electronic analog controllers===
Electronic analog PID control loops were often found within more complex electronic systems, for example, the head positioning of a disk drive, the power conditioning of a power supply, or even the movement-detection circuit of a modern seismometer. Discrete electronic analog controllers have been largely replaced by digital controllers using microcontrollers or FPGAs to implement PID algorithms. However, discrete analog PID controllers are still used in niche applications requiring high-bandwidth and low-noise performance, such as laser-diode controllers.

==Control loop example==

Consider a robotic arm that can be moved and positioned by a control loop. An electric motor may lift or lower the arm, depending on forward or reverse power applied, but power cannot be a simple function of position because of the inertial mass of the arm, forces due to gravity, external forces on the arm such as a load to lift or work to be done on an external object.
* The sensed position is the process variable (PV).
* The desired position is called the setpoint (SP).
* The difference between the PV and SP is the error (e), which quantifies whether the arm is too low or too high and by how much.
* The input to the process (the electric current in the motor) is the output from the PID controller. It is called either the manipulated variable (MV) or the control variable (CV).

By measuring the position (PV), and subtracting it from the setpoint (SP), the error (e) is found, and from it the controller calculates how much electric current to supply to the motor (MV).

===Proportional===
The obvious method is proportional control: the motor current is set in proportion to the existing error. However, this method fails if, for instance, the arm has to lift different weights: a greater weight needs a greater force applied for the same error on the down side, but a smaller force if the error is low on the upside. That&#x27;s where the integral and derivative terms play their part.

===Integral===
An integral term increases action in relation not only to the error but also the time for which it has persisted. So, if the applied force is not enough to bring the error to zero, this force will be increased as time passes. A pure &quot;I&quot; controller could bring the error to zero, but it would be both weakly reacting at the start (because the action would be small at the beginning, depending on time to become significant) and more aggressive at the end (the action increases as long as the error is positive, even if the error is near zero).

Applying too much integral when the error is small and decreasing will lead to overshoot. After overshooting, if the controller were to apply a large correction in the opposite direction and repeatedly overshoot the desired position, the output would oscillate around the setpoint in either a constant, growing, or decaying sinusoid. If the amplitude of the oscillations increases with time, the system is unstable. If it decreases, the system is stable. If the oscillations remain at a constant magnitude, the system is marginally stable.

===Derivative===
A derivative term does not consider the magnitude of the error (meaning it cannot bring it to zero: a pure D controller cannot bring the system to its setpoint), but rather the rate of change of error, trying to bring this rate to zero. It aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line, damping the force applied, and so reduces overshoot (error on the other side because of too great applied force).

===Control damping===
In the interest of achieving a controlled arrival at the desired position (SP) in a timely and accurate way, the controlled system needs to be critically damped. A well-tuned position control system will also apply the necessary currents to the controlled motor so that the arm pushes and pulls as necessary to resist external forces trying to move it away from the required position. The setpoint itself may be generated by an external system, such as a PLC or other computer system, so that it continuously varies depending on the work that the robotic arm is expected to do. A well-tuned PID control system will enable the arm to meet these changing requirements to the best of its capabilities.

===Response to disturbances===
If a controller starts from a stable state with zero error (PV = SP), then further changes by the controller will be in response to changes in other measured or unmeasured inputs to the process that affect the process, and hence the PV. Variables that affect the process other than the MV are known as disturbances. Generally, controllers are used to reject disturbances and to implement setpoint changes. A change in load on the arm constitutes a disturbance to the robot arm control process.

===Applications===
In theory, a controller can be used to control any process that has a measurable output (PV), a known ideal value for that output (SP), and an input to the process (MV) that will affect the relevant PV. Controllers are used in industry to regulate temperature, pressure, force, feed rate, flow rate, chemical composition (component concentrations), weight, position, speed, and practically every other variable for which a measurement exists.

==Controller theory==
:&quot;This section describes the parallel or non-interacting form of the PID controller. For other forms please see .&quot;

The PID control scheme is named after its three correcting terms, whose sum constitutes the manipulated variable (MV). The proportional, integral, and derivative terms are summed to calculate the output of the PID controller. Defining formula_6 as the controller output, the final form of the PID algorithm is
:formula_24

where
: formula_9 is the proportional gain, a tuning parameter,
: formula_10 is the integral gain, a tuning parameter,
: formula_11 is the derivative gain, a tuning parameter,
: formula_28 is the error (SP is the setpoint, and PV(&quot;t&quot;) is the process variable),
: formula_29 is the time or instantaneous time (the present),
: formula_30 is the variable of integration (takes on values from time 0 to the present formula_29).

Equivalently, the transfer function in the Laplace domain of the PID controller is
:formula_32

:::formula_33

where formula_34 is the complex angular frequency.

===Proportional term===
The proportional term produces an output value that is proportional to the current error value. The proportional response can be adjusted by multiplying the error by a constant &quot;K&quot;p, called the proportional gain constant.

The proportional term is given by
:formula_35

A high proportional gain results in a large change in the output for a given change in the error. If the proportional gain is too high, the system can become unstable (see the section on loop tuning). In contrast, a small gain results in a small output response to a large input error, and a less responsive or less sensitive controller. If the proportional gain is too low, the control action may be too small when responding to system disturbances. Tuning theory and industrial practice indicate that the proportional term should contribute the bulk of the output change.

====Steady-state error====

The steady-state error is the difference between the desired final output and the actual one. Because a non-zero error is required to drive it, a proportional controller generally operates with a steady-state error. Steady-state error (SSE) is proportional to the process gain and inversely proportional to proportional gain. SSE may be mitigated by adding a compensating bias term to the setpoint AND output or corrected dynamically by adding an integral term.

===Integral term===
The contribution from the integral term is proportional to both the magnitude of the error and the duration of the error. The integral in a PID controller is the sum of the instantaneous error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have been corrected previously. The accumulated error is then multiplied by the integral gain (&quot;K&quot;i) and added to the controller output.

The integral term is given by
:formula_36

The integral term accelerates the movement of the process towards setpoint and eliminates the residual steady-state error that occurs with a pure proportional controller. However, since the integral term responds to accumulated errors from the past, it can cause the present value to overshoot the setpoint value (see the section on loop tuning).

===Derivative term===
The derivative of the process error is calculated by determining the slope of the error over time and multiplying this rate of change by the derivative gain &quot;K&quot;d. The magnitude of the contribution of the derivative term to the overall control action is termed the derivative gain, &quot;K&quot;d.

The derivative term is given by
:formula_37

Derivative action predicts system behavior and thus improves settling time and stability of the system. An ideal derivative is not causal, so that implementations of PID controllers include an additional low-pass filtering for the derivative term to limit the high-frequency gain and noise. Derivative action is seldom used in practice though – by one estimate in only 25% of deployed controllers – because of its variable impact on system stability in real-world applications.

==Loop tuning==
&quot;Tuning&quot; a control loop is the adjustment of its control parameters (proportional band/gain, integral gain/reset, derivative gain/rate) to the optimum values for the desired control response. Stability (no unbounded oscillation) is a basic requirement, but beyond that, different systems have different behavior, different applications have different requirements, and requirements may conflict with one another.

Even though there are only three parameters and it is simple to describe in principle, PID tuning is a difficult problem because it must satisfy complex criteria within the limitations of PID control. Accordingly, there are various methods for loop tuning, and more sophisticated techniques are the subject of patents; this section describes some traditional, manual methods for loop tuning.

Designing and tuning a PID controller appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives, such as short transient and high stability, are to be achieved. PID controllers often provide acceptable control using default tunings, but performance can generally be improved by careful tuning, and performance may be unacceptable with poor tuning. Usually, initial designs need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired.

Some processes have a degree of nonlinearity, so parameters that work well at full-load conditions do not work when the process is starting up from no load. This can be corrected by gain scheduling (using different parameters in different operating regions).

===Stability===

If the PID controller parameters (the gains of the proportional, integral and derivative terms) are chosen incorrectly, the controlled process input can be unstable; i.e., its output diverges, with or without oscillation, and is limited only by saturation or mechanical breakage. Instability is caused by &quot;excess&quot; gain, particularly in the presence of significant lag.

Generally, stabilization of response is required and the process must not oscillate for any combination of process conditions and setpoints, though sometimes marginal stability (bounded oscillation) is acceptable or desired.

Mathematically, the origins of instability can be seen in the Laplace domain.

The closed-loop transfer function is
: formula_38
where formula_39 is the PID transfer function, and formula_40 is the plant transfer function. A system is &quot;unstable&quot; where the closed-loop transfer function diverges for some formula_34. This happens in situations where formula_42. In other words, this happens when formula_43 with a 180° phase shift. Stability is guaranteed when formula_44 for frequencies that suffer high phase shifts. A more general formalism of this effect is known as the Nyquist stability criterion.

===Optimal behavior===
The optimal behavior on a process change or setpoint change varies depending on the application.

Two basic requirements are &quot;regulation&quot; (disturbance rejection – staying at a given setpoint) and &quot;command tracking&quot; (implementing setpoint changes). These terms refer to how well the controlled variable tracks the desired value. Specific criteria for command tracking include rise time and settling time. Some processes must not allow an overshoot of the process variable beyond the setpoint if, for example, this would be unsafe. Other processes must minimize the energy expended in reaching a new setpoint.

===Overview of tuning methods===
There are several methods for tuning a PID loop. The most effective methods generally involve developing some form of process model and then choosing P, I, and D based on the dynamic model parameters. Manual tuning methods can be relatively time-consuming, particularly for systems with long loop times.

The choice of method depends largely on whether the loop can be taken offline for tuning, and on the response time of the system. If the system can be taken offline, the best tuning method often involves subjecting the system to a step change in input, measuring the output as a function of time, and using this response to determine the control parameters.

===Manual tuning===
If the system must remain online, one tuning method is to first set formula_45 and formula_46 values to zero. Increase the formula_47 until the output of the loop oscillates; then set formula_47 to approximately half that value for a &quot;quarter amplitude decay&quot;-type response. Then increase formula_45 until any offset is corrected in sufficient time for the process, but not until too great a value causes instability. Finally, increase formula_46, if required, until the loop is acceptably quick to reach its reference after a load disturbance. Too much formula_47 causes excessive response and overshoot. A fast PID loop tuning usually overshoots slightly to reach the setpoint more quickly; however, some systems cannot accept overshoot, in which case an overdamped closed-loop system is required, which in turn requires a formula_47 setting significantly less than half that of the formula_47 setting that was causing oscillation.

===Ziegler–Nichols method===
Another heuristic tuning method is known as the Ziegler–Nichols method, introduced by John G. Ziegler and Nathaniel B. Nichols in the 1940s. As in the method above, the formula_45 and formula_46 gains are first set to zero. The proportional gain is increased until it reaches the ultimate gain formula_56 at which the output of the loop starts to oscillate constantly. formula_56 and the oscillation period formula_58 are used to set the gains as follows:
The oscillation frequency is often measured instead, and the reciprocals of each multiplication yields the same result.

These gains apply to the ideal, parallel form of the PID controller. When applied to the standard PID form, only the integral and derivative gains formula_45 and formula_46 are dependent on the oscillation period formula_58.

===Cohen–Coon parameters===
This method was developed in 1953 and is based on a first-order + time delay model. Similar to the Ziegler–Nichols method, a set of tuning parameters were developed to yield a closed-loop response with a decay ratio of formula_62. Arguably the biggest problem with these parameters is that a small change in the process parameters could potentially cause a closed-loop system to become unstable.

===Relay (Åström–Hägglund) method===
Published in 1984 by Karl Johan Åström and Tore Hägglund, the relay method temporarily operates the process using bang-bang control and measures the resultant oscillations. The output is switched (as if by a relay, hence the name) between two values of the control variable. The values must be chosen so the process will cross the setpoint, but they need not be 0% and 100%; by choosing suitable values, dangerous oscillations can be avoided.

As long as the process variable is below the setpoint, the control output is set to the higher value. As soon as it rises above the setpoint, the control output is set to the lower value. Ideally, the output waveform is nearly square, spending equal time above and below the setpoint. The period and amplitude of the resultant oscillations are measured, and used to compute the ultimate gain and period, which are then fed into the Ziegler–Nichols method.

Specifically, the ultimate period formula_58 is assumed to be equal to the observed period, and the ultimate gain is computed as formula_64 where is the amplitude of the process variable oscillation, and is the amplitude of the control output change which caused it.

There are numerous variants on the relay method.

=== First-order model with dead time ===
The transfer function for a first-order process with dead time is

: formula_65

where &quot;k&quot;p is the process gain, &quot;τ&quot;p is the time constant, &quot;θ&quot; is the dead time, and &quot;u&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is a step change input. Converting this transfer function to the time domain results in

: formula_66

using the same parameters found above.

It is important when using this method to apply a large enough step-change input that the output can be measured; however, too large of a step change can affect the process stability. Additionally, a larger step change ensures that the output does not change due to a disturbance (for best results, try to minimize disturbances when performing the step test).

One way to determine the parameters for the first-order process is using the 63.2% method. In this method, the process gain (&quot;k&quot;p) is equal to the change in output divided by the change in input. The dead time &quot;θ&quot; is the amount of time between when the step change occurred and when the output first changed. The time constant (&quot;τ&quot;p) is the amount of time it takes for the output to reach 63.2% of the new steady-state value after the step change. One downside to using this method is that it can take a while to reach a new steady-state value if the process has large time constants.

===Tuning software===
Most modern industrial facilities no longer tune loops using the manual calculation methods shown above. Instead, PID tuning and loop optimization software are used to ensure consistent results. These software packages gather data, develop process models, and suggest optimal tuning. Some software packages can even develop tuning by gathering data from reference changes.

Mathematical PID loop tuning induces an impulse in the system and then uses the controlled system&#x27;s frequency response to design the PID loop values. In loops with response times of several minutes, mathematical loop tuning is recommended, because trial and error can take days just to find a stable set of loop values. Optimal values are harder to find. Some digital loop controllers offer a self-tuning feature in which very small setpoint changes are sent to the process, allowing the controller itself to calculate optimal tuning values.

Another approach calculates initial values via the Ziegler–Nichols method, and uses a numerical optimization technique to find better PID coefficients.

Other formulas are available to tune the loop according to different performance criteria. Many patented formulas are now embedded within PID tuning software and hardware modules.

Advances in automated PID loop tuning software also deliver algorithms for tuning PID Loops in a dynamic or non-steady state (NSS) scenario. The software models the dynamics of a process, through a disturbance, and calculate PID control parameters in response.

==Limitations==
While PID controllers are applicable to many control problems, and often perform satisfactorily without any improvements or only coarse tuning, they can perform poorly in some applications and do not in general provide &quot;optimal&quot; control. The fundamental difficulty with PID control is that it is a feedback control system, with &quot;constant&quot; parameters, and no direct knowledge of the process, and thus overall performance is reactive and a compromise. While PID control is the best controller for an observer without a model of the process, better performance can be obtained by overtly modeling the actor of the process without resorting to an observer.

PID controllers, when used alone, can give poor performance when the PID loop gains must be reduced so that the control system does not overshoot, oscillate or hunt about the control setpoint value. They also have difficulties in the presence of non-linearities, may trade-off regulation versus response time, do not react to changing process behavior (say, the process changes after it has warmed up), and have lag in responding to large disturbances.

The most significant improvement is to incorporate feed-forward control with knowledge about the system, and using the PID only to control error. Alternatively, PIDs can be modified in more minor ways, such as by changing the parameters (either gain scheduling in different use cases or adaptively modifying them based on performance), improving measurement (higher sampling rate, precision, and accuracy, and low-pass filtering if necessary), or cascading multiple PID controllers.

===Linearity and symmetry===
PID controllers work best when the loop to be controlled is linear and symmetric. Thus, their performance in non-linear and asymmetric systems is degraded.

A non-linear valve, for instance, in a flow control application, will result in variable loop sensitivity, requiring dampened action to prevent instability. One solution is the use of the valve&#x27;s non-linear characteristic in the control algorithm to compensate for this.

An asymmetric application, for example, is temperature control in HVAC systems using only active heating (via a heating element), where there is only passive cooling available. When it is desired to lower the controlled temperature the heating output is off, but there is no active cooling due to control output. Any overshoot of rising temperature can therefore only be corrected slowly; it cannot be forced downward by the control output. In this case the PID controller could be tuned to be over-damped, to prevent or reduce overshoot, but this reduces performance by increasing the settling time of a rising temperature to the set point. The inherent degradation of control quality in this application could be solved by application of active cooling.

===Noise in derivative term===
A problem with the derivative term is that it amplifies higher frequency measurement or process noise that can cause large amounts of change in the output. It is often helpful to filter the measurements with a low-pass filter in order to remove higher-frequency noise components. As low-pass filtering and derivative control can cancel each other out, the amount of filtering is limited. Therefore, low noise instrumentation can be important. A nonlinear median filter may be used, which improves the filtering efficiency and practical performance. In some cases, the differential band can be turned off with little loss of control. This is equivalent to using the PID controller as a PI controller.

==Modifications to the algorithm==
The basic PID algorithm presents some challenges in control applications that have been addressed by minor modifications to the PID form.

===Integral windup===
One common problem resulting from the ideal PID implementations is integral windup. Following a large change in setpoint the integral term can accumulate an error larger than the maximal value for the regulation variable (windup), thus the system overshoots and continues to increase until this accumulated error is unwound. This problem can be addressed by:

*Disabling the integration until the PV has entered the controllable region
*Preventing the integral term from accumulating above or below pre-determined bounds
*Back-calculating the integral term to constrain the regulator output within feasible bounds.

===Overshooting from known disturbances===
For example, a PID loop is used to control the temperature of an electric resistance furnace where the system has stabilized. Now when the door is opened and something cold is put into the furnace the temperature drops below the setpoint. The integral function of the controller tends to compensate for error by introducing another error in the positive direction. This overshoot can be avoided by freezing of the integral function after the opening of the door for the time the control loop typically needs to reheat the furnace.

===PI controller===
A PI controller (proportional-integral controller) is a special case of the PID controller in which the derivative (D) of the error is not used.

The controller output is given by
:formula_67
where formula_68 is the error or deviation of actual measured value (PV) from the setpoint (SP).
:formula_69

A PI controller can be modelled easily in software such as Simulink or Xcos using a &quot;flow chart&quot; box involving Laplace operators:
:formula_70
where
:formula_71 = proportional gain
:formula_72 = integral gain

Setting a value for formula_73 is often a trade off between decreasing overshoot and increasing settling time.

The lack of derivative action may make the system more steady in the steady state in the case of noisy data. This is because derivative action is more sensitive to higher-frequency terms in the inputs.

Without derivative action, a PI-controlled system is less responsive to real (non-noise) and relatively fast alterations in state and so the system will be slower to reach setpoint and slower to respond to perturbations than a well-tuned PID system may be.

===Deadband===
Many PID loops control a mechanical device (for example, a valve). Mechanical maintenance can be a major cost and wear leads to control degradation in the form of either stiction or backlash in the mechanical response to an input signal. The rate of mechanical wear is mainly a function of how often a device is activated to make a change. Where wear is a significant concern, the PID loop may have an output deadband to reduce the frequency of activation of the output (valve). This is accomplished by modifying the controller to hold its output steady if the change would be small (within the defined deadband range). The calculated output must leave the deadband before the actual output will change.

===Setpoint step change===
The proportional and derivative terms can produce excessive movement in the output when a system is subjected to an instantaneous step increase in the error, such as a large setpoint change. In the case of the derivative term, this is due to taking the derivative of the error, which is very large in the case of an instantaneous step change. As a result, some PID algorithms incorporate some of the following modifications:

;Setpoint ramping
:In this modification, the setpoint is gradually moved from its old value to a newly specified value using a linear or first-order differential ramp function. This avoids the discontinuity present in a simple step change.
;Derivative of the process variable
:In this case the PID controller measures the derivative of the measured PV, rather than the derivative of the error. This quantity is always continuous (i.e., never has a step change as a result of changed setpoint). This modification is a simple case of setpoint weighting.
;Setpoint weighting
:Setpoint weighting adds adjustable factors (usually between 0 and 1) to the setpoint in the error in the proportional and derivative element of the controller. The error in the integral term must be the true control error to avoid steady-state control errors. These two extra parameters do not affect the response to load disturbances and measurement noise and can be tuned to improve the controller&#x27;s setpoint response.

===Feed-forward===

The control system performance can be improved by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate for whatever difference or &quot;error&quot; remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open-loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can be based on the setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.

For example, in most motion control systems, in order to accelerate a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller is being used to control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.

===Bumpless operation===
PID controllers are often implemented with a &quot;bumpless&quot; initialization feature that recalculates the integral accumulator term to maintain a consistent process output through parameter changes. A partial implementation is to store the integral gain times the error rather than storing the error and postmultiplying by the integral gain, which prevents discontinuous output when the I gain is changed, but not the P or D gains.

===Other improvements===
In addition to feed-forward, PID controllers are often enhanced through methods such as PID gain scheduling (changing parameters in different operating conditions), fuzzy logic, or computational verb logic. Further practical application issues can arise from instrumentation connected to the controller. A high enough sampling rate, measurement precision, and measurement accuracy are required to achieve adequate control performance. Another new method for improvement of PID controller is to increase the degree of freedom by using fractional order. The order of the integrator and differentiator add increased flexibility to the controller.

==Cascade control==
One distinctive advantage of PID controllers is that two PID controllers can be used together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called cascaded PID control. Two controllers are in cascade when they are arranged so that one regulates the set point of the other. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded PID controllers..

For example, a temperature-controlled circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, each with its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater, where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller&#x27;s error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.

The proportional, integral, and differential terms of the two controllers will be very different. The outer PID controller has a long time constant – all the water in the tank needs to heat up or cool down. The inner loop responds much more quickly. Each controller can be tuned to match the physics of the system &quot;it&quot; controls – heat transfer and thermal mass of the whole tank or of just the heater – giving better total response.

==Alternative nomenclature and forms==
===Standard versus parallel (ideal) form===
The form of the PID controller most often encountered in industry, and the one most relevant to tuning algorithms is the &quot;standard form&quot;. In this form the formula_47 gain is applied to the formula_75, and formula_76 terms, yielding:

:formula_77
where
:formula_78 is the &quot;integral time&quot;
:formula_79 is the &quot;derivative time&quot;

In this standard form, the parameters have a clear physical meaning. In particular, the inner summation produces a new single error value which is compensated for future and past errors. The proportional error term is the current error. The derivative components term attempts to predict the error value at formula_79 seconds (or samples) in the future, assuming that the loop control remains unchanged. The integral component adjusts the error value to compensate for the sum of all past errors, with the intention of completely eliminating them in formula_78 seconds (or samples). The resulting compensated single error value is then scaled by the single gain formula_47 to compute the control variable.

In the parallel form, shown in the controller theory section
:formula_83

the gain parameters are related to the parameters of the standard form through formula_84 and formula_85. This parallel form, where the parameters are treated as simple gains, is the most general and flexible form. However, it is also the form where the parameters have the weakest relationship to physical behaviors and is generally reserved for theoretical treatment of the PID controller. The standard form, despite being slightly more complex mathematically, is more common in industry.

===Reciprocal gain, a.k.a. proportional band===
In many cases, the manipulated variable output by the PID controller is a dimensionless fraction between 0 and 100% of some maximum possible value, and the translation into real units (such as pumping rate or watts of heater power) is outside the PID controller. The process variable, however, is in dimensioned units such as temperature. It is common in this case to express the gain formula_47 not as &quot;output per degree&quot;, but rather in the reciprocal form of a &quot;proportional band&quot; formula_87, which is &quot;degrees per full output&quot;: the range over which the output changes from 0 to 1 (0% to 100%). Beyond this range, the output is saturated, full-off or full-on. The narrower this band, the higher the proportional gain.

===Basing derivative action on PV===
In most commercial control systems, derivative action is based on process variable rather than error. That is, a change in the setpoint does not affect the derivative action. This is because the digitized version of the algorithm produces a large unwanted spike when the setpoint is changed. If the setpoint is constant then changes in the PV will be the same as changes in error. Therefore, this modification makes no difference to the way the controller responds to process disturbances.

===Basing proportional action on PV===
Most commercial control systems offer the &quot;option&quot; of also basing the proportional action solely on the process variable. This means that only the integral action responds to changes in the setpoint. The modification to the algorithm does not affect the way the controller responds to process disturbances.
Basing proportional action on PV eliminates the instant and possibly very large change in output caused by a sudden change to the setpoint. Depending on the process and tuning this may be beneficial to the response to a setpoint step.
:formula_88
King describes an effective chart-based method.

===Laplace form===
Sometimes it is useful to write the PID regulator in Laplace transform form:
:formula_89

Having the PID controller written in Laplace form and having the transfer function of the controlled system makes it easy to determine the closed-loop transfer function of the system.

===Series/interacting form===
Another representation of the PID controller is the series, or &quot;interacting&quot; form
:formula_90
where the parameters are related to the parameters of the standard form through
:formula_91, formula_92, and
:formula_93
with
:formula_94.

This form essentially consists of a PD and PI controller in series. As the integral is required to calculate the controller&#x27;s bias this form provides the ability to track an external bias value which is required to be used for proper implementation of multi-controller advanced control schemes.

===Discrete implementation===
The analysis for designing a digital implementation of a PID controller in a microcontroller (MCU) or FPGA device requires the standard form of the PID controller to be &quot;discretized&quot;. Approximations for first-order derivatives are made by backward finite differences. formula_6 and formula_1 are discretized with a sampling period formula_97, k is the sample index.

Differentiating both sides of PID equation using Newton&#x27;s notation gives:

formula_98

Derivative terms are approximated as,
:formula_99

So,

:formula_100

Applying backward difference again gives,

:formula_101

By simplifying and regrouping terms of the above equation, an algorithm for an implementation of the discretized PID controller in a MCU is finally obtained:

:formula_102

or:

:formula_103

s.t. formula_104

Note: This method solves in fact formula_105 where formula_106 is a constant independent of t. This constant is useful when you want to have a start and stop control on the regulation loop. For instance, setting Kp,Ki and Kd to 0 will keep u(t) constant. Likewise, when you want to start a regulation on a system where the error is already close to 0 with u(t) non null, it prevents from sending the output to 0.

==Pseudocode==
Here is a very simple and explicit group of pseudocode that can be easily understood by the layman:
* Kp - proportional gain
* Ki - integral gain
* Kd - derivative gain
* dt - loop interval time (assumes reasonable scale)

 previous_error := 0
 integral := 0
 loop:
 error := setpoint − measured_value
 proportional := error;
 integral := integral + error × dt
 derivative := (error - previous_error) / dt
 output := Kp × proportional + Ki × integral + Kd × derivative
 previous_error := error
 wait(dt)
 goto loop

Below a pseudocode illustrates how to implement a PID considering the PID as an IIR filter:

The Z-transform of a PID can be written as (formula_107 is the sampling time):

:formula_108

and expressed in a IIR form (in agreement with the discrete implementation shown above):

:formula_109

We can then deduce the recursive iteration often found in FPGA implementation

:formula_110

 A0 := Kp + Ki*dt + Kd/dt
 A1 := -Kp - 2*Kd/dt
 A2 := Kd/dt
 error[2] := 0 // e(t-2)
 error[1] := 0 // e(t-1)
 error[0] := 0 // e(t)
 output := u0 // Usually the current value of the actuator
 loop:
 error[2] := error[1]
 error[1] := error[0]
 error[0] := setpoint − measured_value
 output := output + A0 * error[0] + A1 * error[1] + A2 * error[2]
 wait(dt)
 goto loop

Here, Kp is a dimensionless number, Ki is expressed in formula_111 and Kd is expressed in s. When doing a regulation where the actuator and the measured value are not in the same unit (ex. temperature regulation using a motor controlling a valve), Kp, Ki and Kd may be corrected by a unit conversion factor. It may also be interesting to use Ki in its reciprocal form (integration time). The above implementation allows to perform an I-only controller which may be useful in some cases.

In the real world, this is D-to-A converted and passed into the process under control as the manipulated variable (MV). The current error is stored elsewhere for re-use in the next differentiation, the program then waits until dt seconds have passed since start, and the loop begins again, reading in new values for the PV and the setpoint and calculating a new value for the error.

Note that for real code, the use of &quot;wait(dt)&quot; might be inappropriate because it doesn&#x27;t account for time taken by the algorithm itself during the loop, or more importantly, any pre-emption delaying the algorithm.

A common issue when using formula_46 is the response to the derivative of a rising or falling edge of the setpoint as shown below:
A typical workaround is to filter the derivative action using a low pass filter of time constant formula_113 where formula_114:
A variant of the above algorithm using an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter for the derivative:

 A0 := Kp + Ki*dt
 A1 := -Kp
 error[2] := 0 // e(t-2)
 error[1] := 0 // e(t-1)
 error[0] := 0 // e(t)
 output := u0 // Usually the current value of the actuator
 A0d := Kd/dt
 A1d := - 2.0*Kd/dt
 A2d := Kd/dt
 N := 5
 tau := Kd / (Kp*N) // IIR filter time constant
 alpha := dt / (2*tau)
 d0 := 0
 d1 := 0
 fd0 := 0
 fd1 := 0
 loop:
 error[2] := error[1]
 error[1] := error[0]
 error[0] := setpoint − measured_value
 // PI
 output := output + A0 * error[0] + A1 * error[1]
 // Filtered D
 d1 := d0
 d0 := A0d * error[0] + A1d * error[1] + A2d * error[2]
 fd1 := fd0
 fd0 := ((alpha) / (alpha + 1)) * (d0 + d1) - ((alpha - 1) / (alpha + 1)) * fd1
 output := output + fd0 
 wait(dt)
 goto loop

<text>Almdudler () is the brand name of a popular herbal carbonated soft drink from Austria.

==Product==
The original Almdudler is a sweetened carbonated beverage made of herbal extracts. Almdudler has been called the &quot;national drink of Austria&quot;. Its popularity in Austria is second only to Coca-Cola. About 80 million litres of the beverage are produced per year.

Almdudler is currently sold in original, light (sugar-free), &quot;still&quot; (uncarbonated), and &quot;g&#x27;spritzt&quot; (mixed with carbonated mineral water) versions. In Austria, a &quot;Radler&quot; variety (mixed with beer), is available as &quot;Almradler&quot;. In the wine-growing regions of Lower Austria and Burgenland, it is a popular mixer with locally produced red and white wines.

==History==
After three years of development, Almdudler was produced from 1957 by the Viennese entrepreneur Erwin Klein (1924–1983). According to the company&#x27;s website, he derived the name from the then-common phrase &quot;auf der Alm dudeln&quot;, which means &quot;yodeling in the (alpine) pasture&quot;. The drink was originally created and marketed as an alternative to alcoholic beverages or as a mixer for alcoholic drinks.

Klein promoted the popularity of Almdudler through advertising and sponsoring at major sporting events, such as the 1964 Winter Olympics held in Innsbruck. Since 1973, the Almdudler company only functions as a license supplier.

The Austrian family business Pfanner and the mineral water company Franken Brunnen have been distribution partners in Germany since 2016, and Stardrinks AG (a subsidiary of Heineken Switzerland AG) in Switzerland. For the 60th anniversary of the brand in 2017, the American artist Mel Ramos created a painting with the name &quot;Almdudler’s Fabulous Blonde&quot;.

Almdudler remains wholly owned by the Klein family. Erwin Klein’s son Thomas serves as chairman of the parent company supervisory board, while Gerhard Schilling has been managing director since 2004.

==Marketing and distribution==
Almdudler is currently bottled in Austria, Germany, Croatia, Belgium, and Switzerland. It is further exported to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Romania, Australia, and the United States.

In 2017, American figurative painter Mel Ramos created a painting for the brand&#x27;s 60th anniversary entitled &quot;Almdudler&#x27;s Fabulous Blonde&quot;, which was exhibited in the Vienna Museum of Art History. The famous award winning advertising slogan for Almdudler &quot;Wenn die kan Almdudler hab&#x27;n, geh i wieder ham.&quot; &quot;If they don&#x27;t have any Almdudler I&#x27;m going home&quot;. Was written by English Creative director Simon North.

== Popularity ==
Nearly 99 percent of all Austrians know the herbal soft drink. Almdudler was ranked 7th in Austria&#x27;s largest brand study. The so-called Brand Asset Valuator by the Young &amp; Rubicam agency measures brand value from the consumer&#x27;s point of view, and the 2000 respondents chose Almdudler as the only Austrian beverage brand among the top 10. Over 80 million liters of Almdudler are produced every year; 14 percent (as of 2010) and 20 percent (as of 2014) of total sales are bottled and sold in foreign markets.

<doc id="66264" wikidata="Q339725" url="?curid=66264" title="Hexose">
<text>In chemistry, a hexose is a monosaccharide (simple sugar) with six carbon atoms. The chemical formula for all hexoses is , and their molecular weight is 180.156 g/mol.

Hexoses exist in two forms, open-chain or cyclic, that easily convert into each other in aqueous solutions. The open-chain form of a hexose, which usually is favored in solutions, has the general structure , where &quot;n&quot; is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Namely, five of the carbons have one hydroxyl functional group () each, connected by a single bond, and one has an oxo group (), forming a carbonyl group (). The remaining bonds of the carbon atoms are satisfied by seven hydrogen atoms. The carbons are commonly numbered 1 to 6 starting at the end closest to the carbonyl.

Hexoses are extremely important in biochemistry, both as isolated molecules (such as glucose and fructose) and as building blocks of other compounds such as starch, cellulose, and glycosides. Hexoses can form dihexose (like sucrose) by a condensation reaction that makes 1,6-glycosidic bond.

When the carbonyl is in position 1, forming an formyl group (), the sugar is called an aldohexose, a special case of aldose. Otherwise, if the carbonyl position is 2 or 3, the sugar is a derivative of a ketone, and is called a ketohexose, a special case of ketose; specifically, an &quot;n&quot;-ketohexose. However, the 3-ketohexoses have not been observed in nature, and are difficult to synthesize; so the term &quot;ketohexose&quot; usually means 2-ketohexose.

In the linear form, there are 16 aldohexoses and eight 2-ketohexoses, stereoisomers that differ in the spatial position of the hydroxyl groups. These species occur in pairs of optical isomers. Each pair has a conventional name (like &quot;glucose&quot; or &quot;fructose&quot;), and the two members are labeled &quot;-&quot; or &quot;-&quot;, depending on whether the hydroxyl in position 5, in the Fischer projection of the molecule, is to the right or to the left of the axis, respectively. These labels are independent of the optical activity of the isomers. In general, only one of the two enantiomers occurs naturally (for example, -glucose) and can be metabolized by animals or fermented by yeasts.

The term &quot;hexose&quot; sometimes is assumed to include deoxyhexoses, such as fucose and rhamnose: compounds with general formula that can be described as derived from hexoses by replacement of one or more hydroxyl groups with hydrogen atoms.

==Classification==
===Aldohexoses===
The aldohexoses are a subclass of the hexoses which, in the linear form, have the carbonyl at carbon 1, forming an aldehyde derivative with structure . The most important example is glucose.

In linear form, an aldohexose has four chiral centres, which give 16 possible aldohexose stereoisomers (24), comprising 8 pairs of enantiomers. The linear forms of the eight -aldohexoses, in the Fischer projection, are

Of these -isomers, all except -altrose occur in living organisms, but only three are common: -glucose, -galactose, and -mannose. The -isomers are generally absent in living organisms; however, -altrose has been isolated from strains of the bacterium &quot;Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens&quot;.

When drawn in this order, the Fischer projections of the -aldohexoses can be identified with the 3-digit binary numbers from 0 to 7, namely 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111. The three bits, from left to right, indicate the position of the hydroxyls on carbons 4, 3, and 2, respectively: to the right if the bit value is 0, and to the left if the value is 1.

The chemist Emil Fischer is said to have devised the following mnemonic device for remembering the order given above, which corresponds to the configurations about the chiral centers when ordered as 3-bit binary strings:
:All altruists gladly make gum in gallon tanks.
referring to allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, talose.

The Fischer diagrams of the eight -aldohexoses are the mirror images of the corresponding -isomers; with all hydroxyls reversed, including the one on carbon 5.

===Ketohexoses===
A ketohexose is a ketone-containing hexose. 
The important ketohexoses are the 2-ketohexoses, and the most important 2-ketose is fructose.

Besides the 2-ketoses, there are only the 3-Ketoses, and they do not exist in nature, although at least one 3-ketohexose has been synthesized, with great difficulty.

In the linear form, the 2-ketohexoses have three chiral centers and therefore eight possible stereoisomers (23), comprising four pairs of enantiomers. The four -isomers are:

The corresponding forms have the hydroxyls on carbons 3, 4,and 5 reversed. Below are
depiction of the eight isomers in an alternative style:


==3-Ketohexoses==
In theory, the ketohexoses include also the 3-ketohexoses, which have the carbonyl in position 3; namely . However, these compounds are not known to occur in nature, and are difficult to synthesize.

In 1897, an unfermentable product obtained by treatment of fructose with bases, in particular lead(II) hydroxide, was given the name &quot;glutose&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;glucose&quot; and &quot;fructose&quot;, and was claimed to be a 3-ketohexose. However, subsequent studies showed that the substance was a mixture of various other compounds.

The unequivocal synthesis and isolation of a 3-ketohexose, &quot;xylo&quot;-3-hexulose, through a rather complex route, was first reported in 1961 by George U. Yuen and James M. Sugihara.

==Cyclic forms==
Like most monosaccharides with five or more carbons, each aldohexose or 2-ketohexose also exists in one or more cyclic (closed-chain) forms, derived from the open-chain form by an internal rearrangement between the carbonyl group and one of the hydroxyl groups.

The reaction turns the group into a hydroxyl, and the hydroxyl into an ether bridge () between the two carbon atoms, thus creating a ring with one oxygen atom and four or five carbons.

If the cycle has five carbon atoms (six atoms in total), the closed form is called a pyranose, after the cyclic ether tetrahydropyran, that has the same ring. If the cycle has four carbon atoms (five in total), the form is called furanose after the compound tetrahydrofuran. The conventional numbering of the carbons in the closed form is the same as in the open-chain form.

If the sugar is an aldohexose, with the carbonyl in position 1, the reaction may involve the hydroxyl on carbon 4 or carbon 5, creating a hemiacetal with five- or six-membered ring, respectively. If the sugar is a 2-ketohexose, it can only involve the hydroxyl in carbon 5, and will create a hemiketal with a five-membered ring.

The closure turns the carboxyl carbon into a chiral center, which may have either of two configurations, depending on the position of the new hydroxyl. Therefore, each hexose in linear form can produce two distinct closed forms, identified by prefixes &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;.

It has been known since 1926 that hexoses in the crystalline solid state assume the cyclic form. The &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; forms, which are not enantiomers, will usually crystallize separately as distinct species. For example, -glucose forms an α crystal that has specific rotation of +112° and melting point of 146 °C, as well as a β crystal that has specific rotation of +19° and melting point of 150 °C.

The linear form does not crystallize, and exists only in small amounts in water solutions, where it is in equilibrium with the closed forms. Nevertheless, it plays an essential role as the intermediate stage between those closed forms.

In particular, the &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; forms can convert to into each other by returning to the open-chain form and then closing in the opposite configuration. This process is called mutarotation.

==Chemical properties==
Although all hexoses have similar structures and share some general properties, each enantiomer pair has its own chemistry. Fructose is soluble in water, alcohol, and ether. The two enantiomers of each pair generally have vastly different biological properties.

2-Ketohexoses are stable over a wide pH range, and with a primary p&quot;K&quot;a of 10.28, will only deprotonate at high pH, so are marginally less stable than aldohexoses in solution.

==Natural occurrence and uses==
The aldohexose that is most important in biochemistry is -glucose, which is the main &quot;fuel&quot; for metabolism in many living organisms.

The 2-ketohexoses psicose, fructose and tagatose occur naturally as the -isomers, whereas sorbose occurs naturally as the -isomer.

-Sorbose is commonly used in the commercial synthesis of ascorbic acid. -Tagatose is a rare natural ketohexose that is found in small quantities in food. -Fructose is responsible for the sweet taste of many fruits, and is a building block of sucrose, the common sugar.

==Deoxyhexoses==

The term &quot;hexose&quot; may sometimes be used to include the deoxyhexoses, which have one or more hydroxyls () replaced by hydrogen atoms (). It is named as the parent hexose, with the prefix &quot;&quot;x&quot;-deoxy-&quot;, the &quot;x&quot; indicating the carbon with the affected hydroxyl. Some examples of biological interest are
* -Fucose (6-deoxy--galactose)
* -Rhamnose (6-deoxy--mannose)
* -Quinovose (6-deoxy--glucose), found as part of the sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG)
* -Pneumose (6-deoxy--talose)
* -Fuculose (6-deoxy--tagatose)

<text>Mark Andrew Spitz (born February 10, 1950) is an American former competitive swimmer and nine-time Olympic champion. He was the most successful athlete at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, winning seven gold medals, each in world-record time. This achievement set a record that lasted for 36 years, until it was surpassed by fellow American Michael Phelps, who won eight golds at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Phelps, like Spitz, set seven world records.

Between 1968 and 1972, Spitz won nine Olympic golds, a silver, and a bronze, in addition to five Pan American golds, 31 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) titles, and eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles. During those years he set 35 world records, two of which were in trials and unofficial. &quot;Swimming World Magazine&quot; named him World Swimmer of the Year in 1969, 1971, and 1972. He was the third athlete to win nine Olympic gold medals.

==Early life==
Spitz was born on February 10, 1950, in Modesto, California, the eldest of three children of Lenore Sylvia ( Smith) and Arnold Spitz. His family is Jewish; his father&#x27;s family was from Hungary, and his mother&#x27;s, originally surnamed Sklotkovick, was from Russia. When he was two years old, his family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he swam at Waikiki beach every day. &quot;You should have seen that little boy dash into the ocean. He&#x27;d run like he was trying to commit suicide,&quot; Lenore Spitz told a reporter for &quot;Time&quot; in 1968. When he was six, the family returned to Sacramento, California, and he began to compete at his local swim club. At age nine, he was training at Arden Hills Swim Club in Sacramento with swimming coach Sherm Chavoor, who mentored six other Olympic medal winners.

At 10, Spitz held one world age-group record and 17 national records. When Spitz was 14, his family moved to Santa Clara, where he joined the Santa Clara Swim Club and was trained by coach George F. Haines. From 1964 to 1968, Spitz trained with Haines at SCSC and Santa Clara High School. During his four years there, Spitz held national high school records in every stroke and in every distance. In 1966 at age 16, he won the 100-meter butterfly at the AAU national championships, the first of his 24 total AAU titles. The following year, Spitz emerged on the world swimming stage when he set his first world record at a small California meet with a time of 4:10.60 in the 400-meter freestyle.

==Swimming career==
===Maccabiah Games===
Spitz swam in his first international competition at the 1965 Maccabiah Games in Israel. At age 15 and weighing 130 pounds, he won four gold medals in Tel Aviv—the 400 m freestyle, the 1500 m freestyle, the 400 m individual medley, and the 800 m freestyle relay—and was named the most outstanding athlete of the Games.

He returned to Israel in 1969 following the Mexico Olympics to again compete, at the 1969 Maccabiah Games, where he won six gold medals and was again named outstanding athlete of the Games.

In 1985, Spitz lit the torch to open the 1985 Maccabiah Games.

In 2005, he was a member of the U.S. delegation at the 2005 Maccabiah Games. He spoke at the JCC Maccabiah Games Opening Ceremonies, which was held in Richmond, Virginia. The Weinstein JCC in Richmond was one of the Host JCC&#x27;s for the 2005 games, with over 1,000 teenagers participating in various sports, including swimming.

===Pan American Games===
He won five gold medals at the 1967 Pan American Games, setting a record that lasted until 2007 when Brazilian swimmer Thiago Pereira won six golds at the XV Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro.

===1968 Olympics===




Spitz was already the holder of ten world records, and he brashly predicted that he would win six gold medals at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. However, he won only two team golds: the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in 3:31.70, and the 4×200-meter freestyle relay in 7:52.33. In addition, Spitz finished second to fellow American Doug Russell in the 100-meter butterfly. He lost to Russell by a half second, despite holding the world record and having beaten Russell the previous ten times they had swum against each other that year. Russell did briefly match Spitz&#x27;s world record in late August 1967, holding the record equally with Spitz for five days before Spitz regained it solely on October 2, 1967. As a result of being beaten by Russell, Spitz did not get to swim in the 4×100-meter medley relay, which gave Russell his second gold medal and the USA team another world record performance.

===College training===
Spitz was disappointed in his 1968 Olympic performance. In January 1969, he decided to attend Indiana University to train with Indiana Hoosiers swimming coach Doc Counsilman, who was also his Olympic coach in Mexico City. He called choosing Indiana and Counsilman &quot;the biggest decision of my life (and) the best.&quot; While at Indiana, Spitz won eight individual NCAA titles. In 1971, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Spitz also set a number of world records during the U.S. Olympic Swim Trials held in Chicago&#x27;s Portage Park in 1972.

He was nicknamed &quot;Mark the Shark&quot; by his teammates.

===1972 Olympics===





At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Spitz was back to repeat his quest for the six gold medals. He did even better, winning seven Olympic gold medals. Furthermore, Spitz set a new world record in each of the seven events – 100-meter freestyle (51.22), 200-meter freestyle (1:52.78), 100-meter butterfly (54.27), 200-meter butterfly (2:00.70), 4×100-meter freestyle relay (3:26.42), 4×200-meter freestyle relay (7:35.78), and 4×100-meter medley relay (3:48.16). Spitz was originally reluctant to swim the 100-meter freestyle, fearing that he would not win the gold medal. Minutes before the race, he confessed on the pool deck to ABC&#x27;s Donna de Varona, &quot;I know I say I don&#x27;t want to swim before every event, but this time I&#x27;m serious. If I swim six and win six, I&#x27;ll be a hero. If I swim seven and win six, I&#x27;ll be a failure.&quot; Spitz won by half a stroke in a world-record time of 51.22 seconds.
Spitz is one of seven Olympians (four of them swimmers) to win nine or more career gold medals: Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, Carl Lewis, Katie Ledecky, and Caeleb Dressel also have nine; only Michael Phelps has won more, with 23. Spitz&#x27;s record of seven gold medals in a single Olympics was not surpassed until Phelps broke the record at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

After he had completed his events, Spitz left Munich early as a result of the Munich Massacre, where eleven Israeli athletes were taken hostage and later murdered by Palestinian terrorists. Being Jewish himself, there was concern among the Olympic authorities that Spitz would become a likely target for the Palestinians and he was escorted to London for his own safety. It is believed that he was escorted out of the country by US Marines stationed in West Germany.

===Retirement===

Following the Munich Olympics, Spitz retired from competition even though he was only 22 years old.

At age 41, Spitz attempted a comeback for the 1992 Summer Olympics after filmmaker Bud Greenspan offered him a million dollars if he succeeded in qualifying. Spitz&#x27;s comeback attempt made the cover of &quot;Parade&quot; and was also reported on in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Esquire&quot;. Filmed by Greenspan&#x27;s cameras, Spitz was two seconds slower than the Olympic standard and failed to qualify.

In 1999, Spitz ranked No. 33 on &quot;ESPN SportsCentury 50 Greatest Athletes&quot;, the only aquatic athlete to make the list.

==Film and television career==
After Spitz retired from competitive swimming at age 22, he was managed by the William Morris Agency, which tried to get him into show business while he was still a household name due to his athletic success.

A poster featuring Spitz wearing his swimsuit and gold medals that led ESPN to retroactively label him &quot;the hottest pin-up since Betty Grable&quot;.

In Spitz&#x27;s TV debut, he appeared as himself in a skit as a dentist on a Bob Hope special that aired October 5, 1972. In 1973–74, Spitz appeared on TV&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;. On the TV drama &quot;Emergency!&quot;, he portrayed Pete Barlow, whose wife (played by Spitz&#x27;s wife, Suzy) is accidentally shot by a handgun in an overfull drawer. He also appeared briefly on &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; of California Governor Ronald Reagan in September 1973.

Spitz went to work for ABC Sports in 1976 and worked on many sports presentations, including coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In 1985 he appeared as a TV announcer in &quot;Challenge of a Lifetime&quot;. He continued as a broadcaster for some time, but within a few years, he was hardly seen as a public figure except perhaps as a commentator for swimming events like the 2004 Summer Olympics. Instead Spitz focused on his real estate company in Beverly Hills and hobbies such as sailing.

===Narration===
Spitz narrated &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Fury&quot;, a 2006 Hungarian documentary about the Olympic water polo team&#x27;s Blood in the Water match against the Soviet Union during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 which was repressed by the Soviet Union—considered among the most famous water polo matches. The film was executive produced by Quentin Tarantino and Lucy Liu, and made its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.

===Commercials===
He appeared in an advertisement for the California Milk Advisory Board. One of his print advertisements featured the caption &quot;I always drink it--is something I like to do. I want to be loved by the mothers.&quot;

In 1974, he was in a number of Schick razors commercials. In 1998 he appeared with Evel Knievel in a TV commercial for PlayStation.

In 1982, bestselling author Clive Cussler, mentioned Mark Spitz in the novel &quot;Pacific Vortex!&quot;, the origin-story of Dirk Pitt.

In 2004, he appeared in a TV commercial for Sprint PCS. Then in November 2007, Spitz made a cameo appearance on Amanda Beard&#x27;s first television commercial (for GoDaddy) featuring her own seven Olympic medals (won between 1996 and 2004). The ad was entitled &quot;Shock&quot;. Also, in 2007 he appeared in the infomercial for the &quot;Orbitrek Elite&quot; fitness workout.

In 2012, Spitz appeared in a commercial for Ageless Male, a testosterone supplement.

In a 2019 commercial, Spitz pitched a personal EKG device by KardiaMobile.

In 2022, Spitz endorsed the health supplement Relief Factor.

==Personal life==

===Family life===
When Spitz returned from the Olympics, he began dating Suzy Weiner, a UCLA theater student and part-time model, who also was the daughter of one of his father&#x27;s business acquaintances. Less than a year after the Munich Olympics, they were married on May 6, 1973, in a traditional Jewish service at the Beverly Hills Hotel. They have two sons, Matthew (born October 1981) and Justin (born September 1991). Justin was a member of the Stanford swim team. Spitz and his wife reside in Los Angeles, California.

===Education===
At Indiana University from 1968 to 1972, Spitz was a pre-dental student and member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. &quot;Time&quot; magazine asked him if he wanted to return to dental school after the Olympics. &quot;I always wanted to be a dentist from the time I was in high school, and I was accepted to dental school in the spring of 1972. I was planning to go, but after the Olympics there were other opportunities. I did some television and speaking engagements, and things just went from there.&quot; Spitz graduated from Indiana University in 1972.

===Post-swimming career===
After Spitz&#x27;s return to the United States following the 1972 Olympics, he landed several lucrative corporate endorsement contracts. He earned about $7 million in a two-year period. &quot;A million dollars in 1972 would be equivalent to more than $10 million today,&quot; Spitz said in 2007. &quot;I did very well, thank you very much.&quot; Spitz added, &quot;I would say I was a pioneer. There wasn&#x27;t anyone who&#x27;d gone to the Olympics before me who capitalized the same way on opportunity. It depends on timing, it depends on hype, it depends on the economy, and most importantly, it depends on looks. I mean, I&#x27;ve never seen a magazine of uglies. That&#x27;s our society. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s right. That&#x27;s just the facts.&quot; Spitz went on to start a real estate company.

Per his official website, Spitz is self-employed as a corporate spokesperson and motivational speaker. However, Sports Yahoo! lists his occupation as a stock broker and motivational speaker. According to one interview, &quot;Spitz became a stockbroker in 2002 and has since moved into private equity. He is now also dabbling in the &#x27;water business&#x27;, as he calls it, and is in negotiations to build a water-bottling facility on aquifer-rich land that he and a business partner own.&quot;

Spitz has pursued various entrepreneurial projects with former NBA player Rick Barry. He travels the world, delivering about 25 lectures a year. His biography, &quot;The Extraordinary Life of An Olympic Champion&quot; by Richard J. Foster, was released in July 2008.

In July 2012, he endorsed Istanbul&#x27;s bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, but the award went to Tokyo.

===Hobbies===
His hobbies include sailing, skiing and collecting art.

===Famous moustache during Olympics===
In an era when other swimmers, male and female, were shaving body hair, he swam with a moustache. When asked why he initially grew one, he stated: &quot;I grew the moustache because a coach in college said I couldn&#x27;t grow one.&quot; Spitz said he originally grew the moustache as a form of rebellion against the clean-cut look imposed on him in college. &quot;It took a long time to grow,&quot; he said. It took four months to grow, but Spitz was proud of it, he decided the moustache was a &quot;good-luck piece&quot;.

Spitz is quoted as saying, &quot;When I went to the Olympics, I had every intention of shaving the moustache off, but I realized I was getting so many comments about it—and everybody was talking about it—that I decided to keep it. I had some fun with a Russian coach who asked me if my moustache slowed me down. I said, &#x27;No, as a matter of fact, it deflects water away from my mouth, allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet-shaped in the water, and that&#x27;s what had allowed me to swim so great.&#x27;
According to a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article, on February 14, 1988, after talking about shaving off his moustache for a year, he finally did. &quot;He looked great with it, don&#x27;t get me wrong,&quot; explained his wife Suzy, &quot;but he looks so handsome without it.&quot;

When he was asked why he shaved it off, he responded: &quot;Well, one, I&#x27;m not swimming anymore; two, it started to turn gray; and three, my wife had never seen me, nor my family, without the moustache ... I&#x27;m happy [without it].&quot; He also commented on his moustache in a live, in-studio interview with KCRA host Mike TeSelle on June 14, 2008, with Spitz stating that he no longer maintains his iconic moustache because it had become &quot;too gray&quot;.

===Health issues===
After retirement, Spitz was diagnosed with acid reflux disease, a condition from which his physician thinks he suffered throughout his career. &quot;During my Olympic training, I attributed the symptoms [of acid reflux] to an overexposure to chlorine and eating too soon before and after swimming,&quot; says Spitz. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t until the symptoms began to get in the way of my 1976 Olympic broadcasting career in Montreal, which was four years after retirement that I suspected something more serious must be happening.&quot;

He has also reported having high cholesterol and other chronic health issues. &quot;People don&#x27;t believe that I have high cholesterol, but it&#x27;s a fact,&quot; said Spitz. &quot;I take medication every day because my doctor told me that diet and exercise are not enough to keep my cholesterol down.&quot; He is a paid spokesperson for Medco, a pharmacy benefit management company.

==Olympic controversies==

===1972 medal podium incident===
In 1972, Spitz was accused of product placement during the medal ceremony. Following his victory in the 200-meter freestyle, Spitz carried his shoes and arrived barefoot to obtain his gold medal. He put them down as the American national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was played. After the anthem, he picked up his shoes and waved to the crowd. The Soviet officials viewed this as product placement and complained to the IOC. When questioned by the IOC, Spitz explained that the gesture was innocent, the shoes were old and he was not paid. The IOC cleared him of any wrongdoing.

===Issues with 2008 Summer Olympics===
Spitz has said that he felt snubbed by not being asked to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics to watch Michael Phelps attempt to break his seven-gold-medal record: &quot;I never got invited. You don&#x27;t go to the Olympics just to say, I am going to go. Especially because of who I am. ... I am going to sit there and watch Michael Phelps break my record anonymously? That&#x27;s almost demeaning to me. It is not almost—it is.&quot; Spitz added, &quot;They voted me one of the top five Olympians of all time. Some of them are dead. But they invited the other ones to go to the Olympics, but not me,&quot; he said. &quot;Yes, I am a bit upset about it.&quot; Spitz has stated that he has no hard feelings towards Phelps.

However, on August 14, 2008, Spitz appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; where he clarified his statement and his pride in Michael Phelps:

Also on August 14, 2008, in an interview aired on Los Angeles KNBC-4&#x27;s morning news show, &quot;Today in L.A.&quot;, Spitz was quoted saying he does believe that &quot;Michael Phelps is the greatest Olympic athlete ever.&quot;

On August 15, 2008, as part of an interview on NBC, Spitz said that he felt Phelps&#x27;s performance in the 100 fly in Beijing was &quot;epic&quot;. Spitz paid this compliment to Phelps just two hours after his record-tying seventh gold medal during a live joint interview with Bob Costas:

In 2015, Spitz allegedly claimed that he had seen an email from Omega, the official timekeeper, that Phelps had lost the closely contested 100m butterfly final in 2008. He later claimed that his quote had been &quot;misconstrued&quot;.

===Views on drug testing===

Spitz has been consistent in his criticism of the two swimming world bodies, FINA and the IOC, in their incomplete attempts to keep drugs out of the sport. He has felt that not enough has been done to monitor and encourage drug-free participation. In 1998 he criticized FINA for its &quot;embarrassing&quot; attempts to stamp out drug abuse, urging them to test for all known drugs. In September 1999 Spitz said the IOC had the technology to test for a plethora of drugs but was refusing to do so because of some IOC member protests.

During a radio interview in Australia, Spitz was quoted as saying &quot;They don&#x27;t want to test for everything because there&#x27;s tremendous pressure from the television networks because they want the television to have athletic competitions with the world record holders there for the finals. They want the medals not to be tainted in their value of accomplishment by winning them, and it&#x27;s all about ratings and commercial selling of time and about money. And an International Olympic Committee has got their hand in the pockets of the network television people, so there&#x27;s a tremendous conflict of interest in what they should do and what they&#x27;re doing.&quot;

In August 2008, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Spitz continued to discuss drug testing and was saying &quot;the IOC has sponsors who demand a good show. Television pays the IOC for the rights to that good show, and its sponsors want that too. Drug news and drug distractions are not a good show. People are not going to tune in to see athletes have their medals taken away from them.&quot;

<doc id="66267" wikidata="Q470488" url="?curid=66267" title="Homesteading the Noosphere">
<text>&quot;Homesteading the Noosphere&quot; (abbreviated HtN) is an essay written by Eric S. Raymond about the social workings of open-source software development. It follows his previous piece &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; (1997).

The essay examines issues of project ownership and transfer, as well as investigating possible anthropological roots of the gift culture in open source as contrasted with the exchange culture of closed source software. Raymond also investigates the nature of the spread of open source into the untamed frontier of ideas he terms the noosphere, postulating that projects that range too far ahead of their time fail because they are too far out in the wilderness, and that successful projects tend to relate to existing projects.

Raymond delves into the contrast between the stated aims of open source and observed behaviors, and also explores the underlying motivations of people involved in the open-source movement. He notes that a key motivation for open-source practitioners is their membership of and reputation within each project&#x27;s &quot;tribe&quot;. In contrast, Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;embrace and extend&quot; policy complexified and closed up Internet protocols with &quot;protocol pollution.&quot;

The first chapter of the novel series also bears the same name.

<text>The term chloride refers to a compound or molecule that contains either a chlorine anion (), which is a negatively charged chlorine atom, or a non-charged chlorine atom covalently bonded to the rest of the molecule by a single bond (). The pronunciation of the word &quot;chloride&quot; is .

Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often soluble in water. It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating liquid flow in and out of cells. Other examples of ionic chlorides include potassium chloride (), calcium chloride (), and ammonium chloride (). Examples of covalent chlorides include methyl chloride (), carbon tetrachloride (), sulfuryl chloride (), and monochloramine ().

==Electronic properties==
A chloride ion (diameter 167 pm) is much larger than a chlorine atom (diameter 99 pm). The chlorine atom&#x27;s hold on the valence shell is weaker because the chloride anion has one more electron than it does. The ion is colorless and diamagnetic. In aqueous solution, it is highly soluble in most cases; however, for some chloride salts, such as silver chloride, lead(II) chloride, and mercury(I) chloride, they are only slightly soluble in water. In aqueous solution, chloride is bonded by the protic end of the water molecules.

==Reactions of chloride==
Chloride can be oxidized but not reduced. The first oxidation, as employed in the chlor-alkali process, is conversion to chlorine gas. Chlorine can be further oxidized to other oxides and oxyanions including hypochlorite (ClO−, the active ingredient in chlorine bleach), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), chlorate (), and perchlorate ().

In terms of its acid–base properties, chloride is a weak base as indicated by the negative value of the p&quot;K&quot;a of hydrochloric acid. Chloride can be protonated by strong acids, such as sulfuric acid:
:NaCl + H2SO4 → NaHSO4 + HCl

Ionic chloride salts react with other salts to exchange anions. The presence of halide ions like chloride can be detected using silver nitrate. A solution containing chloride ions will produce a white silver chloride precipitate:
:Cl− + Ag+ → AgCl

The concentration of chloride in an assay can be determined using a chloridometer, which detects silver ions once all chloride in the assay has precipitated via this reaction.

Chlorided silver electrodes are commonly used in electrophysiology.

==Other oxyanions==
Chlorine can assume oxidation states of −1, +1, +3, +5, or +7. Several neutral chlorine oxides are also known.

==Occurrence in nature==
In nature, chloride is found primarily in seawater, which has a chloride ion concentration of 19400 mg/liter. Smaller quantities, though at higher concentrations, occur in certain inland seas and in subterranean brine wells, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea in Israel. 
Most chloride salts are soluble in water, thus, chloride-containing minerals are usually only found in abundance in dry climates or deep underground. Some chloride-containing minerals include halite (sodium chloride NaCl), sylvite (potassium chloride KCl), bischofite (MgCl2∙6H2O), carnallite (KCl∙MgCl2∙6H2O), and kainite (KCl∙MgSO4∙3H2O). It is also found in evaporite minerals such as chlorapatite and sodalite.

===Role in biology===
Chloride has a major physiological significance, which includes regulation of osmotic pressure, electrolyte balance and acid-base homeostasis. Chloride is present in all body fluids, and is the most abundant extracellular anion which accounts for around one third of extracellular fluid&#x27;s tonicity.

Chloride is an essential electrolyte, playing a key role in maintaining cell homeostasis and transmitting action potentials in neurons. It can flow through chloride channels (including the GABAA receptor) and is transported by KCC2 and NKCC2 transporters.

Chloride is usually (though not always) at a higher extracellular concentration, causing it to have a negative reversal potential (around −61 mV at 37 °C in a mammalian cell). Characteristic concentrations of chloride in model organisms are: in both &quot;E. coli&quot; and budding yeast are 10–200 mM (dependent on medium), in mammalian cells 5–100 mM and in blood plasma 100 mM.

Chloride is also needed for the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.

The concentration of chloride in the blood is called serum chloride, and this concentration is regulated by the kidneys. A chloride ion is a structural component of some proteins; for example, it is present in the amylase enzyme. For these roles, chloride is one of the essential dietary mineral (listed by its element name &quot;chlorine&quot;). Serum chloride levels are mainly regulated by the kidneys through a variety of transporters that are present along the nephron. Most of the chloride, which is filtered by the glomerulus, is reabsorbed by both proximal and distal tubules (majorly by proximal tubule) by both active and passive transport.

===Corrosion===

The presence of chlorides, such as in seawater, significantly worsens the conditions for pitting corrosion of most metals (including stainless steels, aluminum and high-alloyed materials). Chloride-induced corrosion of steel in concrete lead to a local breakdown of the protective oxide form in alkaline concrete, so that a subsequent localized corrosion attack takes place.

===Environmental threats===
Increased concentrations of chloride can cause a number of ecological effects in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. It may contribute to the acidification of streams, mobilize radioactive soil metals by ion exchange, affect the mortality and reproduction of aquatic plants and animals, promote the invasion of saltwater organisms into previously freshwater environments, and interfere with the natural mixing of lakes. Sodium chloride has also been shown to change the composition of microbial species at relatively low concentrations. It can also hinder the denitrification process, a microbial process essential to nitrate removal and the conservation of water quality, and inhibit the nitrification and respiration of organic matter.

==Production==
The chlor-alkali industry is a major consumer of the world&#x27;s energy budget. This process converts concentrated sodium chloride solutions into chlorine and sodium hydroxide, which are used to make many other materials and chemicals. The process involves two parallel reactions:
:2 Cl− → + 2 e−
:2  + 2 e− → H2 + 2 OH−
==Examples and uses==
An example is table salt, which is sodium chloride with the chemical formula NaCl. In water, it dissociates into Na+ and Cl− ions. Salts such as calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride have varied uses ranging from medical treatments to cement formation.

Calcium chloride (CaCl2) is a salt that is marketed in pellet form for removing dampness from rooms. Calcium chloride is also used for maintaining unpaved roads and for fortifying roadbases for new construction. In addition, calcium chloride is widely used as a de-icer, since it is effective in lowering the melting point when applied to ice.

Examples of covalently-bonded chlorides are phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, and thionyl chloride, all three of which are reactive chlorinating reagents that have been used in a laboratory.

===Water quality and processing===
A major application involving chloride is desalination, which involves the energy intensive removal of chloride salts to give potable water. In the petroleum industry, the chlorides are a closely monitored constituent of the mud system. An increase of the chlorides in the mud system may be an indication of drilling into a high-pressure saltwater formation. Its increase can also indicate the poor quality of a target sand.

Chloride is also a useful and reliable chemical indicator of river and groundwater fecal contamination, as chloride is a non-reactive solute and ubiquitous to sewage and potable water. Many water regulating companies around the world utilize chloride to check the contamination levels of the rivers and potable water sources.

===Food===
Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are used to preserve food and as nutrients or condiments.

<doc id="66270" wikidata="Q311332" url="?curid=66270" title="Greg Louganis">
<text>Gregory Efthimios Louganis (; born January 29, 1960) is an American Olympic diver who won gold medals at the 1984 and 1988 Summer Olympics on the springboard and platform. He is the only man and the second diver in Olympic history to sweep the diving events in consecutive Olympic Games. He has been called both &quot;the greatest American diver&quot; and &quot;probably the greatest diver in history&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Louganis was born in El Cajon, California, and is of Samoan and Swedish descent. His teenage biological parents placed him for adoption when he was eight months old and he was raised in California by his adoptive parents, Frances and Peter Louganis. His adoptive father was of Greek descent. Louganis reconnected with his biological father, Fouvale Lutu, in 1984. Through the help of DNA tests and his half-siblings, he found his biological mother in 2017.

He started taking dance, acrobatics, and gymnastics classes at 18 months, after witnessing his sister&#x27;s classes and attempting to join in. By the age of three, he was practicing daily and was competing and giving public performances. For the next few years, he regularly competed and performed at various places including nursing homes and the local naval base. As a child, he was diagnosed with asthma and allergies, so to help with the conditions, he was encouraged to continue the dance and gymnastics classes. He also took up trampolining, and at the age of nine began diving lessons after the family got a swimming pool. He attended Santa Ana High School in Santa Ana, Valhalla High School in El Cajon, and Mission Viejo High School in Mission Viejo.

In 1978, he subsequently attended the University of Miami, where he majored in drama and continued diving. In 1981, he transferred to the University of California, Irvine, where he graduated with a major in theater and a minor in dance in 1983.

==Diving career==
As a Junior Olympic competitor, Louganis caught the eye of Sammy Lee, two-time Olympic champion, who began coaching him. At 16, Louganis took part in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, where he placed second in the tower event, behind Italian sport legend Klaus Dibiasi. Two years later, with Dibiasi retired, Louganis won his first world title in the same event with the help of coach Ron O&#x27;Brien of the Mission Viejo Nadadores.

Louganis was a favorite for two golds in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, but an American boycott of the games prevented him from participating. He was one of 461 athletes to receive a Congressional Gold Medal years later. Louganis won two titles at the world championships in 1982, where he became the first diver in a major international meeting to get a perfect score of 10 from all seven judges. At the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, with record scores and leads over his opponents, Louganis won gold medals in both the springboard and tower diving events.

He won two more world championship titles in 1986.

At the 1988 Seoul Olympics, he struck his head on the springboard during the preliminary rounds, leading to a concussion. He completed the preliminaries despite his injury. He then earned the highest single score of the qualifying round for his next dive and repeated the dive during the finals, earning the gold medal by a margin of 25 points. In the 10 m finals, he won the gold medal, performing a 3.4 difficulty dive in his last attempt, earning 86.70 points for a total of 638.61, surpassing silver medalist Xiong Ni by only 1.14 points. His comeback earned him the title of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; &quot;Athlete of the Year&quot; for 1988.

===HIV status and head injury===
Six months before the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Louganis was diagnosed with HIV and started antiretrovirals. After Louganis came out publicly as HIV-positive in 1995, people in and out of the international diving community began to question Louganis&#x27;s decision not to disclose his HIV status at the time of his head injury during the 1988 Olympics, given that he had bled into a pool that others then dove into. Louganis has stated that, during the ordeal, he was &quot;paralyzed with fear&quot; that he would infect another competitor or the doctor who treated him. Ultimately, no one else was infected. John Ward, chief of HIV-AIDS surveillance at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted that the incident posed no risk to others because any blood was highly diluted by the pool water and &quot;chlorine kills HIV&quot;. Since skin is an effective barrier to HIV, the only way the virus could enter would be through an open wound; &quot;If the virus just touches the skin, it is unheard of for it to cause infection: the skin has no receptors to bind HIV,&quot; explained the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&#x27; Anthony Fauci at the time.

===Endorsement deals===
Louganis got few endorsement deals following his 1984 and 1988 Olympic victories, his one major deal being Speedo, a partnership which lasted until 2007. Some of his fellow athletes blamed homophobia for his lack of deals, since he had been rumored to be gay even before he came out. Louganis has stated that he suspects that his sexuality played a part, although he feels that in part he was simply overshadowed in the public imagination by other American Olympians, most notably Mary Lou Retton.

In 2016, Louganis was pictured on boxes of Wheaties cereal, where prominent American athletes are famously featured, as part of a special &quot;Legends&quot; series that also included 1980s Olympians Janet Evans and Edwin Moses. This occurred approximately a year after a Change.org petition was launched that requested that he be featured, although General Mills denied any influence from the petition.

===Coaching===
In November 2010, Louganis began coaching divers of a wide range of ages and abilities in the SoCal Divers Club in Fullerton, California.

He was a mentor to the U.S. diving team at the London 2012 Olympics and the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics.

==Media career==
===Acting===
Louganis had been a theater major in college, and in the late 1980s and 1990s, he appeared in a number of movies, including &quot;Touch Me&quot; in 1997.

In 1993, he played the role of Darius in an Off-Broadway production of the play &quot;Jeffrey&quot;. In 1995, he starred for six weeks in the Off-Broadway production of Dan Butler&#x27;s one man-show about gay life, &quot;The Only Thing Worse You Could Have Told Me&quot;, taking over from Butler himself. In the play he portrayed 14 different characters.

In 2008, he appeared in the film &quot;Watercolors,&quot; in the role of Coach Brown, a swimming instructor in a high school.

In 2012, he appeared in the ninth episode of the second season of IFC&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Portlandia&quot;, playing himself.

===Television===
In September 2000, Louganis appeared on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; as a member of famous Olympic gold medalists &quot;Dream Team.&quot;

In 2013, Louganis was Dive Master in the celebrity diving show &quot;Splash&quot; on ABC, and a diving judge on &quot;Celebrity Splash!&quot; on Channel 7 in Australia.

In 2020, he was a diving judge on the second season of the ABC show &quot;Holey Moley&quot;.

===Books and video diary===
In 1996, Louganis recounted his story in a bestselling autobiography, &quot;Breaking the Surface&quot;, co-written with Eric Marcus. In the book, Louganis detailed a relationship of domestic abuse and rape as well as teenage depression, and how he began smoking and drinking at a young age. The book spent five weeks at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

In 1998, Louganis released a video diary called &quot;Looking to the Light&quot;, which picked up where &quot;Breaking the Surface&quot; left off.

In 1999, Louganis co-wrote the book &quot;For the Life of Your Dog: A Complete Guide to Having a Dog From Adoption and Birth Through Sickness and Health&quot; with Betty Sicora Siino.

==Dog agility competitions==
After retiring from diving, Louganis began to compete in dog agility competitions; he has said that being around the dogs gave him &quot;a sense of security, company and unconditional love&quot;. His dogs have included Dr. Schivago; Captain Woof Blitzer; Nipper and son, Dobby, both champion Jack Russell terriers; Gryff (Gryffindor), a border collie; and Hedwig, a Hungarian Pumi. Nipper was named for the RCA dog, while Gryff, Dobby and Hedwig were named for Harry Potter characters, as Louganis is a self-described &quot;huge Harry Potter fan.&quot;

==Activism==

Louganis is a gay rights activist, as well as an HIV awareness advocate. He has worked frequently with the Human Rights Campaign to defend the civil liberties of the LGBT community and people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS.

In the October/November 2010 issue of &quot;ABILITY&quot; Magazine, Louganis stated that the &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; policy was &quot;absurd,&quot; &quot;unconstitutional,&quot; and a &quot;witch-hunt.&quot; He added that &quot;gay men and women have been serving this country for years ... [it&#x27;s] basically encouraging people who are serving our country to lie to each other.&quot;

Louganis is on the board of directors to the USA-based chapter of the charitable foundation of Princess Charlene of Monaco.

In 2023, it was reported that Louganis is auctioning three of his five Olympic medals in an effort to fund the Damien Center, Indiana&#x27;s oldest and largest AIDS services center. &quot;The medals, they&#x27;re in the history books,&quot; he said. &quot;Instead of holding on to them, I&#x27;m aiming to share my piece of Olympic history with collectors; together, we can help the Damien Center and its community to grow and thrive.&quot;

==Personal life==

From 1983 to 1989, Louganis was involved romantically with his manager, R. James &quot;Jim&quot; Babbitt. Louganis has described the relationship as abusive, saying that, at one point in 1983, Babbitt raped him at knife point. Louganis also accused Babbitt of taking 80 percent of his earnings.

Six months before the 1988 Olympics, Louganis was diagnosed with HIV; he had contracted the virus from Babbitt. His doctor placed him on the antiretroviral drug AZT, which he took every four hours round the clock.

In 1989, Louganis obtained a restraining order against Babbitt. Babbitt died of AIDS in 1990.

When Louganis turned 33, in 1993, he agreed to gather friends and family for a birthday party, but one that he envisioned as a final goodbye, as he was in failing health and thought he would soon die of AIDS.

But, with treatment, he kept going and, in 1994, at the opening ceremony at that year&#x27;s Gay Games, Louganis came out publicly as gay in a pre-taped announcement, at the encouragement of the event&#x27;s organizers. Even before then, however, he led a life that has been described as &quot;openly gay.&quot;

In 1995, around the time of the release of his memoir, &quot;Breaking the Surface&quot;, Louganis revealed his HIV status in an interview with Barbara Walters, speaking openly, for the first time, about being both gay and HIV-positive.

In June 2013, Louganis announced, in &quot;People&quot; magazine, his engagement to his partner, paralegal Johnny Chaillot. The two were married on October 12, 2013, but on June 18, 2021, Louganis revealed on Instagram that he and Chaillot were ending their marriage.

==In popular culture==

As a follow-up to the success of the book, Canadian television and film director Steven Hilliard Stern directed &quot;Breaking the Surface: The Greg Louganis Story&quot; in 1997, starring Mario Lopez as Louganis, with Louganis also appearing in certain scenes of the television film and as narrator. Louganis also produced a video diary called &quot;Looking To the Light&quot;, which picked up where &quot;Breaking the Surface&quot; left off.

Actor Michael Fassbender took Louganis&#x27;s gait and mannerisms as inspiration for his portrayal of an advanced humanoid robot in the 2012 film &quot;Prometheus&quot;, stating that &quot;Louganis was my first inspiration. I figured that I&#x27;d sort of base my physicality roughly around him, and then it kind of went from there.&quot;

Louganis was the subject of the documentary &quot;Back on Board&quot; which aired on HBO on August 4, 2015.

<doc id="66273" wikidata="Q313879" url="?curid=66273" title="Olaf II of Denmark">
<text>Olaf II of Denmark (December 1370 – 3 August 1387) was King of Denmark as Olaf II (though occasionally referred to as Olaf III) from 1376 and King of Norway as Olav IV from 1380 until his death. Olaf was the son of Queen Margaret I of Denmark and King Haakon VI of Norway, and grandson of kings Magnus IV of Sweden and Valdemar IV of Denmark.

==Reign==
When his grandfather Valdemar IV of Denmark died, Olaf was just five years old. He was proclaimed king of Denmark by a Danehof in Slagelse the following year. His mother, Queen Margaret, was to serve as regent due to his young age. His proclamation included the title &quot;true heir of Sweden&quot; added at his mother&#x27;s insistence since both his father and his paternal grandfather, Magnus IV, had been kings of Sweden until they were forced to abdicate. Olaf was hailed as king in Scania, including the towns controlled by the Hanseatic league since the Treaty of Stralsund in 1370. Queen Margaret signed a coronation charter on behalf of Olaf, who was too young to rule until he came of age at fifteen. In the charter Olaf agreed to meet with the Danehof at least once a year and return properties his grandfather Valdemar IV had confiscated during his reign.

Olaf became king of Norway on his father&#x27;s death in 1380. Even when Olaf reached his majority in 1385, his mother ruled through him. With his ascent to the Norwegian throne, Denmark and Norway were thus united in a personal union ruled from Denmark. Denmark and Norway would have the same king, with the exception of short interregna, until Norway&#x27;s independence from Denmark in 1814, as a result of the Treaty of Kiel.

==Death and aftermath==
Olaf died unexpectedly at Falsterbohus in August 1387 at age 16. He was buried at Sorø Abbey on the Danish island of Zealand where his grandfather and, later, his mother, were also buried. Rumors immediately arose that Olaf had been poisoned. Following her son&#x27;s death, Margaret united all three Scandinavian kingdoms in a personal union. After Olaf, no Norwegian king was to be born on Norwegian soil for more than 550 years, until Harald V, born in 1937, became king in 1991. Olaf&#x27;s death was also the end of the male line of the House of Bjälbo. In 2015 Jørgen Lange Thomsen, a forensic scientist, proposed a theory Olaf II died from Brugada syndrome.

In 1402, he was impersonated by the False Olaf.

<text>This page lists residential areas of Edinburgh situated in the Edinburgh (settlement) urban area.
The urban area of Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is located in the City of Edinburgh council area and in East Lothian. The City of Edinburgh council area is divided into wards areas that are combined into four operational management areas termed &quot;localities&quot;:


The localities are further divided into Neighbourhood Partnership (NP) Areas:

The Edinburgh urban area covers most of the Neighbourhood Partnership areas, however, some of the areas are only covered partly, in particular Almond NP and Pentlands NP. Likewise, less than half of the North West and the South West localities are part of the urban area. In addition to the areas inside the City of Edinburgh council area, Musselburgh and Wallyford in East Lothian also take part of the Edinburgh urban area.

Residential areas are situated inside or located across borders of the larger Neighbourhood Partnership areas or locality areas. The edges of the residential areas are generally defined by roads, though actual lines on the ground are not defined precisely. The names of areas are often given to major roads in those areas, although this is not always the case.

<doc id="66275" wikidata="Q5479132" url="?curid=66275" title="Coati">
<text>Coatis (from Tupí), also known as coatimundis (), are members of the family Procyonidae in the genera &quot;Nasua&quot; and &quot;Nasuella&quot; (comprising the subtribe Nasuina). They are diurnal mammals native to South America, Central America, Mexico, and the Southwestern United States. The name &quot;coatimundi&quot; comes from the Tupian languages of Brazil, where it means &quot;lone coati&quot;. Locally in Belize, the coati is known as &quot;quash&quot;.

==Physical characteristics==
Adult coatis measure from head to the base of the tail, which can be as long as their bodies. Coatis are about tall at the shoulder and weigh between , about the size of a large house cat. Males can become almost twice as large as females and have large, sharp canine teeth. The measurements above relate to the white-nosed and South America coatis. The two species of mountain coati are smaller.

All coatis share a slender head with an elongated, flexible, slightly upturned nose, small ears, dark feet, and a long non-prehensile tail used for balance and signaling.

Ring-tailed coatis have either a light brown or black coat, with a lighter underpart and a white-ringed tail in most cases. Coatis have a long brown tail with rings on it which are anywhere from starkly defined like a raccoon&#x27;s to very faint. As in raccoons but not ring-tailed cats and cacomistles, the rings go completely around the tail. Coatis often hold the tail erect; it is used as such to keep troops of coatis together in tall vegetation. The tip of the tail can be moved slightly on its own, as is the case with cats, but it is not prehensile as is that of the kinkajou, another procyonid.

Coatis have bear- and raccoon-like paws and walk plantigrade like raccoons and bears (on the soles of the feet, as do humans). Coatis have nonretractable claws. Coatis also are able to rotate their ankles beyond 180°, in common with raccoons and other procyonids (and others in the order Carnivora and rare cases among other mammals); they are therefore able to descend trees head first. (Other animals living in forests have acquired some or all of these properties through convergent evolution, including members of the mongoose, civet, weasel, cat, and bear families.)

The coati snout is long and somewhat pig-like – part of the reason for its nickname, the &quot;hog-nosed raccoon&quot;. It is also extremely flexible and can rotate up to 60° in any direction. They use their noses to push objects and rub parts of their body. The facial markings include white markings around the eyes and on the ears and snout.

Coatis have strong limbs to climb and dig and have a reputation for intelligence, like their fellow procyonid, the raccoon. Unlike the nocturnal raccoons, however, most coatis are diurnal, although some may exhibit cathemeral behavior. They prefer to sleep or rest in elevated places and niches, like the rainforest canopy, in crudely built sleeping nests.

==Habitat and range==
Overall, coatis are widespread, occupying habitats ranging from hot and arid areas to humid Amazonian rainforests or even cold Andean mountain slopes, including grasslands and bushy areas. Their geographical range extends from the southwestern U.S. (southern Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas) through northern Uruguay. Around 10 coatis are thought to have formed a breeding population in Cumbria, UK.

==Taxonomy==
The following species are recognised:
* Genus &quot;Nasua&quot;
** &quot;Nasua narica&quot; – white-nosed coati (Southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, and Colombia)
** &quot;Nasua nasua&quot; – South American coati (South America)
* Genus &quot;Nasuella&quot;
** &quot;Nasuella meridensis&quot; – eastern mountain coati (Venezuela)
** &quot;Nasuella olivacea&quot; – western mountain coati (Colombia and Ecuador)

The Cozumel Island coati was formerly recognised as a species, but the vast majority of recent authorities treat it as a subspecies, &quot;N. narica nelsoni&quot;, of the white-nosed coati.

Genetic evidence (cytochrome b sequences) has suggested that the genus &quot;Nasuella&quot; should be merged into &quot;Nasua&quot;, as the latter is otherwise paraphyletic. Other genetic studies have shown that the closest relatives of the coatis are the olingos (genus &quot;Bassaricyon&quot;); the two lineages are thought to have diverged about 10.2 million years ago.

==Lifespan==
Coatis can live up to seven years in the wild. In captivity, their average lifespan is about 14 years, and some coatis can live into their late teens.

==Feeding habits==
Coatis are omnivores; their diet consists mainly of ground litter, invertebrates, such as tarantula, and fruit (Alves-Costa et al., 2004, 2007; Hirsch 2007). They also eat small vertebrate prey, such as lizards, rodents, small birds, birds&#x27; eggs, and crocodile eggs. The snout, with an acute sense of smell, assists the paws in a hog-like manner to unearth invertebrates.

==Behaviour==

Little is known about the behaviour of the mountain coatis, and the following is almost entirely about the coatis of the genus &quot;Nasua&quot;. Unlike most members of the raccoon family (Procyonidae), coatis are primarily diurnal. Nasua coati females and young males up to two years of age are gregarious and travel through their territories in noisy, loosely organised bands made up of four to 25 individuals, foraging with their offspring on the ground or in the forest canopy. Males over two years become solitary due to behavioural disposition and collective aggression from the females and will join the female groups only during the breeding season.

When provoked, or for defence, coatis can be fierce fighters; their strong jaws, sharp canine teeth, and fast scratching paws, along with a tough hide sturdily attached to the underlying muscles, make it very difficult for potential predators (e.g., dogs or jaguars) to seize the smaller mammal.

Coatis communicate their intentions or moods with chirping, snorting, or grunting sounds. Different chirping sounds are used to express joy during social grooming, appeasement after fights, or to convey irritation or anger. Snorting while digging, along with an erect tail, states territorial or food claims during foraging. Coatis additionally use special postures or moves to convey simple messages; for example, hiding the nose between the front paws as a sign for submission; lowering the head, baring teeth, and jumping at an enemy signal an aggressive disposition. Individuals recognise other coatis by their looks, voices, and smells, the individual smell is intensified by special musk-glands on their necks and bellies.

Coatis from Panama are known to rub their own fur and that of other troop members with resin from &quot;Trattinnickia aspera&quot; (Burseraceae) trees, but its purpose is unclear. Some proposed possibilities are it serves as an insect repellent, a fungicide, or as a form of scent-marking. Coatis rub preputial gland secretions on objects in their home ranges, but do not have anal glands.

==Reproduction==
 Coati breeding season mainly corresponds with the start of the rainy season to coincide with maximum availability of food, especially fruits: between January and March in some areas, and between October and February in others. Female and young coatis commonly live in bands of 5 to 40 and travel together. The males are solitary and join the bands only during the short mating season.
For this period, an adult male is accepted into the band of females and juveniles near the beginning of the breeding season, leading to a polygynous mating system.

The pregnant females separate from the group, build a nest on a tree or in a rocky niche and, after a gestation period of about 11 weeks, give birth to litters of three to seven kits. About six weeks after birth, the females and their young will rejoin the band. Females become sexually mature at two years of age, while males will acquire sexual maturity at three years of age.

==Natural predators==
Coati predators include jaguarundis, anacondas, pumas, maned wolves, boa constrictors, foxes, dogs, tayras, ocelots, and jaguars. Large raptors, such as ornate hawk-eagles, black-and-chestnut eagles, and harpy eagles, also are known to hunt them. White-headed capuchin monkeys hunt their pups.

==Status==
In Central and South America, coatis are threatened by environmental destruction and unregulated hunting. A lack of scientifically sound population studies could be leading to an underestimation of the coati population and other ecological problems affecting the species.

==In captivity==
Coatis are one of five groups of procyonids commonly kept as pets in various parts of North, Central and South America, the others being the raccoons (common and crab-eating), the kinkajou, the ring-tailed cat and cacomistle. However, while both the white-nosed and South America coatis are common in captivity, mountain coatis are extremely rare in captivity.

Coatis are small creatures that can be wild, somewhat difficult to control or train in some cases, and generally behave in a manner radically different from that of a pet dog. Optimally, they should have a spacious outdoor enclosure and a coati-proofed room in the house and/or other climate-controlled place, as well. They can be given the run of the house but need careful watching, more careful in some cases than others.

It is possible to litter or toilet train coatis; if one cannot be trained as such, it is still possible to lessen problems in that they tend to designate a latrine area, which can have a litter pan placed in it as is done with many ferrets, pet skunks, rabbits, and rodents. Coatis generally need both dog and cat vaccines for distemper and many other diseases and an inactivated rabies vaccine. They can be spayed or neutered for the same reason as cats and dogs and other pets.

<text>Olaf Tryggvason (960s – 9 September 1000) was King of Norway from 995 to 1000. He was the son of Tryggvi Olafsson, king of Viken (Vingulmark, and Rånrike), and, according to later sagas, the great-grandson of Harald Fairhair, first King of Norway. He is numbered as Olaf I.

Olaf was important in the conversion of the Norse to Christianity, but he did so forcibly within his own kingdom. He is said to have built the first Christian church in Norway in 995, and to have founded the city of Trondheim in 997. A statue dedicated to him is located in the city&#x27;s central plaza.

Historical information on Olaf is sparse. He is mentioned in some contemporary English sources, and some skaldic poems. The oldest narrative source mentioning him briefly is Adam of Bremen&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; of &quot;circa&quot; 1070.

In the 1190s, two Latin versions of &quot;Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar&quot; were written in Iceland, by Oddr Snorrason and Gunnlaugr Leifsson – these are now lost, but are thought to form the basis of later Norse versions. Snorri Sturluson gives an extensive account of Olaf in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; saga of &quot;circa&quot; 1230, using Oddr Snorrason&#x27;s saga as his primary source. Modern historians do not assume that these late sources are accurate, and their credibility is debated. The most detailed account is named &quot;Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta&quot; (&quot;Greatest Saga of Óláfr Tryggvason&quot;) and is recorded in the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;, and in the early 15th-century &quot;Bergsbók&quot;.

==Biography==
The account in this article is primarily based on the late sagas.

===Birth and early life===

There is uncertainty about both the date and the place of Olaf&#x27;s birth. The earliest Norwegian written source, the &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; of the late twelfth century, states that Olaf was born in the Orkney Islands after his mother fled there to escape the killers of Olaf&#x27;s father. Another late 12th-century source, &quot;Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum&quot;, states that Olaf&#x27;s mother fled to Orkney with Olaf when he was three years old for the same reason. All the sagas agree that Olaf eventually came to Kievan Rus&#x27;, specifically the court of Vladimir the Great of Kiev.

The version in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; is the most elaborate, but also the latest, and introduces elements to the story that are not found in earlier sources. It states that Olaf was born shortly after the murder of his father in 963, while other sources suggest a date between 964 and 969. The later dates cast doubt over Olaf&#x27;s claim to be of Harald Fairhair&#x27;s kin, and the legitimacy of his claim to the throne. Snorri Sturluson claims in &quot;Olaf Tryggvson&#x27;s saga&quot; that Olaf was born on an islet in Fjærlandsvatnet, where his mother Astrid Eiriksdottir, daughter of Eirik Bjodaskalle, was hiding from her husband&#x27;s killers, led by Harald Greycloak, the son of Eirik Bloodaxe. Greycloak and his brothers had seized the throne from Haakon the Good. Astrid fled to her father&#x27;s home in Oppland, then went on to Sweden where she thought she and Olaf would be safe. Greycloak sent emissaries to the king of Sweden, and asked for permission to take the boy back to Norway, where he would be raised by Greycloak&#x27;s mother Gunhild. The Swedish king gave them men to help them claim the young boy, but to no avail. After a short scuffle Astrid (with her son) fled again. This time their destination was Gardarike (Kiev), where Astrid&#x27;s brother Sigurd was in the service of Vladimir the Great. Olaf was three years old when they set sail on a merchant ship for Novgorod. The journey was not successful: in the Baltic Sea they were captured by Estonian vikings, and the people aboard were either killed or taken as slaves. Olaf became the possession of a man named Klerkon, together with his foster father Thorolf and his son Thorgils. Klerkon considered Thorolf too old to be useful as a slave and killed him, and then sold the two boys to a man named Klerk for a ram. Olaf was then sold to a man called Reas for a fine cloak. Six years later, Sigurd Eirikson traveled to Estonia to collect taxes for King Vladimir. He saw a boy who did not appear to be a native. He asked the boy about his family, and the boy told him he was Olaf, son of Tryggve Olafson and Astrid Eiriksdattir. Sigurd then went to Reas and bought Olaf and Thorgils out from slavery, and took the boys with him to Novgorod to live under the protection of Vladimir.

Still according to &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, one day in the Novgorod marketplace Olaf encountered Klerkon, his enslaver and the murderer of his foster father. Olaf killed Klerkon with an axe blow to the head. A mob followed the young boy as he fled to his protector Queen Allogia, with the intent of killing him for his misdeed. Only after Allogia had paid blood money for Olaf did the mob calm down. As Olaf grew older, Vladimir made him chief over his men-at-arms, but after a couple years the king became wary of Olaf and his popularity with his soldiers. Fearing he might be a threat to the safety of his reign, Vladimir stopped treating Olaf as a friend. Olaf decided that it was better for him to seek his fortune elsewhere, and set out for the Baltic.

===Raiding===
&quot;Heimskringla&quot; states that after leaving Novgorod, Olaf raided settlements and ports with success. In 982 he was caught in a storm and made port in Wendland, where he met Queen Geira, a daughter of King Burizleif. She ruled the part of Wendland in which Olaf had landed, and Olaf and his men were given an offer to stay for the winter. Olaf accepted and after courting the Queen, they were married. Olaf began to reclaim the baronies which while under Geira&#x27;s rule had refused to pay taxes. After these successful campaigns, he began raiding again both in Skåne and Gotland.

===Relationship and marriage to Geira===
Olaf Tryggvason&#x27;s relationship with Geira began when Geira was warned that there were a large number of ships sitting in the harbor outside of her kingdom. Queen Geira told the man who informed her to invite them to her kingdom, telling him that she would have them over for a feast. Once Olaf and his men arrived, Queen Geira welcomed them in, held a feast for them, and engaged in very meaningful conversation with Olaf. This conversation led to Olaf and his men staying for a few days, and a relationship starting between the two leaders. Eventually these two would agree to a marriage while Olaf and his troops were still there. Later, during one of their conversations, Olaf asked Geira if there were any towns that she had lost control over. She replied, &quot;Lord, I can name for you the towns that have escaped from our control; we have suffered their arrogance for a long time.&quot; Following this conversation, Olaf went out and recaptured these towns for Geira. Following this, and their marriage, Olaf would stay in the country until the untimely death of Geira.

===Alliance with Emperor Otto II===
Holy Roman Emperor Otto II assembled a great army of Saxons, Franks, Frisians, and Wends to fight the Norse pagan Danes. Olaf was part of this army because his father-in-law was king of Wendland. Otto&#x27;s army met the armies of King Harald Bluetooth and Haakon Jarl, the ruler of Norway under the Danish king, at Danevirke, a great wall near Schleswig. Otto&#x27;s army was unable to break the fortification, so he changed tactics and sailed around it to Jutland with a large fleet. Otto won a large battle there, and forced Harald and Haakon with their armies to convert to Christianity. The constituents of Otto&#x27;s army then returned to their homelands. Harald held to his new religion, but Haakon returned to worshipping the pagan gods when he came home.

===Death of Geira and conversion===

After Olaf had spent three years in Wendland, his wife Geira died. He felt so much sorrow from her death that he could no longer bear to stay in Wendland, and set out to plunder in 984. He raided from Friesland to the Hebrides. After four years he landed on one of the Scilly Isles. He heard of a seer who lived there. Desiring to test the seer, he sent one of his men to pose as Olaf. But the seer was not fooled. So Olaf went to see the hermit, now convinced he was a real fortune teller. And the seer told him:

Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others&#x27; good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptized.

After the meeting mutineers attacked Olaf, and he was wounded but survived, and as a result he converted to Christianity.

David Hugh Farmer, in the Oxford Dictionary of Saints, writes &#x27;it is tempting&#x27; to identify the seer with Saint Lide who lived on the island of St Helen&#x27;s in the Isles of Scilly.

By another account, Saint Ælfheah of Canterbury baptized him near Andover, Hampshire, England in 994. However, Henrietta Leyser, the author of Ælfheah&#x27;s entry in the &quot;Oxford National Dictionary of Biography&quot;, states that Olaf was already baptized and that the 994 event at Andover was a confirmation of his faith, part of a Danegeld treaty in which he agreed to no longer raid in England.

Following the death of Geira, it states in &quot;The Saga of Olaf&quot; that he travelled to Russia. During his stay here, he had a dream in which God spoke to him. The voice he heard said, &quot;Hear me, you who promise to be a good man, for you never worshipped gods or paid them any reverence. But rather you disgraced them, and for that reason your works will be multiplied for good and profitable ends. Still you are very deficient in those qualities that would allow you to be in these regions and make you deserving to live here in eternity, because you do not know your Creator and you do not know who the true God is.&quot;

===Marriage to Gyda===

In 988, Olaf sailed to England, because a &quot;thing&quot; had been called by Queen Gyda, sister of Olaf Cuaran, King of Dublin. Gyda was the widow of an earl, and was searching for a new husband. A great many men had come, but Gyda singled out Olaf, though he was wearing his bad weather clothes, and the other men wore their finest clothing. They were to be married, but another man, Alfvine, took objection, and challenged Olaf and his men to the Scandinavian duel or holmgang. Olaf and his men fought Alfvine&#x27;s crew and won every battle, but did not kill any of them; instead, they bound them. Alfvine was told to leave the country and never come back again. Gyda and Olaf married, and spent half their time in England and the other half in Ireland.

===Ascent to the throne===

In 995, rumours began to surface in Norway of a king in Ireland of Norwegian blood. This caught the ear of Jarl Haakon, who sent Thorer Klakka to Ireland, posing as a merchant, to see if he was the son of Tryggve Olafson. Haakon told Thorer that if it were him, to lure him to Norway, so Haakon could have him under his power. Thorer befriended Olaf and told him of the situation in Norway, that Jarl Haakon had become unpopular with the populace, because he often took daughters of the elite as concubines, which was his right as ruler. He quickly grew tired of them and sent them home after a week or two. He had also been weakened by his fighting with the Danish king, due to his rejection of the Christian faith.

Olaf seized this opportunity, and sailed for Norway. When he arrived many men had already revolted against Haakon, who was forced to hide in a hole dug in a pigsty, together with his slave, Kark. When Olaf met the rebels they accepted him as their king, and together they started to search for Haakon. They eventually came to the farm where Haakon and Kark were hiding, but did not find them. Olaf held a meeting just outside the swine-sty and promised a great reward for the man who killed Haakon. The two men in the hole heard this speech, and Haakon became distrustful of Kark, fearing he would kill him for the reward. He could not leave the pigsty, nor could he stay awake indefinitely, and when he fell asleep Kark decapitated Haakon with a knife. The next day Kark went to Olaf and presented him the head of Haakon. King Olaf did not reward him, and instead decapitated him.

After his confirmation as King of Norway, Olaf traveled to the parts of Norway that had not been under the rule of Haakon, but that of the King of Denmark; they also swore allegiance to him. He then demanded that they all be baptized, and most reluctantly they agreed.

===Reign===

In 997, Olaf founded his seat of government in Trondheim, where he had first held a &quot;thing&quot; with the revolters against Haakon. It was a suitable site because the River Nid twisted itself before going into the fjord, creating a peninsula that could be easily defended against terrestrial attacks by only one short wall.

Both his Wendish and his Irish wife had brought Olaf wealth and good fortune, but, according to the Sagas, his last wife, Tyra, was his undoing, for it was on an expedition undertaken in 1000 to wrest her lands from Burislav that he was waylaid off the island Svolder by the combined Swedish, Danish, and Wendish fleets, together with the ships of Earl Haakon&#x27;s sons.

=== Attempted conversion of Norway to Christianity ===
It has been suggested that Olaf&#x27;s ambition was to rule a united Christian Scandinavia, and it is known that he made overtures of marriage to Sigrid the Haughty, queen of Sweden, but negotiations failed because of her steadfast pagan faith. Instead, he made an enemy of her, and did not hesitate to involve himself in a quarrel with King Sweyn I of Denmark by marrying Sweyn&#x27;s sister Tyra, who had fled from her heathen husband Burislav, the semi-legendary &quot;King of Wends&quot;, in defiance of her brother&#x27;s authority.

Olaf continued to promote Christianity throughout his reign. He baptized the explorer Leif Ericson, who took a priest with him back to Greenland to convert the rest of his kin. Olaf also converted the people and Earl of the Orkney Islands to Christianity. At that time, the Orkney Islands were part of Norway. While Olaf sent missionaries to other lands and baptized dignitaries who visited Norway to spread Christianity, within his own kingdom he used forced conversion through means such as exile, hostage taking, mutilation, torture, and death for those who refused as well as destroying pagan temples. Noted victims include Thorlief the Wise who had one eye torn out—his torturers were supposed to blind him but his stoic bearing during the torture led them to run away after doing only half the job—and Raud the Strong who had a venomous snake forced into body through his mouth by a red hot iron. Ultimately, Olaf&#x27;s efforts at widespread conversion failed.

===Death===
He died at the sea Battle of Svolder when his forces were defeated by a combined armada from Denmark, Sweden and the Jarls of Lade. Finally surrounded on his flagship the &quot;Ormrinn Langi&quot; (Long Serpent), Danish sources report that when all was lost he committed suicide by throwing himself into the sea, &quot;the end befitting his life&quot;, according to Adam of Bremen. Saxo Grammaticus says that Olaf preferred suicide to death at the hands of the enemy and jumped overboard in full armour rather than see his foes victorious. The Norwegian and Icelandic accounts are more complex and more favourable to Olaf. Hallfreðr&#x27;s memorial poem for his lord had already alluded to rumours that Olaf escaped death at Svolder. The sagas offer a variety of possibilities. &quot;Ágrip&quot; reports:

Other sagas suggest that one way or another Olaf made his way to the shore; perhaps by swimming, perhaps with the help of angels, most likely rescued by one of the Wendish ships present. After his escape, Olaf supposedly sought salvation for his soul abroad, perhaps joining a monastery. &quot;Mesta&quot; describes a series of &quot;sightings&quot; of him in the Holy Land, the last in the 1040s.

==Legacy==

In the early 11th century, a Viking chieftain named Tryggvi invaded Norway, claiming to be the son of Olaf and Gyda. His invasion was defeated by forces loyal to Cnut the Great&#x27;s son Svein Knutsson. An account preserved in &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; relates that Tryggvi was killed by a farmer after the battle. Many years later, when Harald Hardrada was king of Norway, he passed by the site of the battle. The king met an old friend of his who pointed out the alleged assassin. After questioning the purported killer and hearing him confess, King Harald had the man hanged, citing the familial bond between him and Tryggvi and his duty to avenge the latter&#x27;s death.

For some time after the Battle of Svolder, there were rumors that Olaf had survived his leap into the sea and had made his way to safety. Accounts reported by Oddr Snorrason included sightings of Olaf in Rome, Jerusalem, and elsewhere in Europe and the Mediterranean. Both King Ethelred the Unready and Olaf&#x27;s sister Astrid allegedly received gifts from Olaf long after he was presumed dead. The latest sighting reported by Oddr took place in 1046.

Olaf routinely used force to compel conversion to Christianity, including execution and torture of those who refused. Raud the Strong refused to convert and, after a failed attempt using a wooden pin to pry open his mouth to insert a snake, was killed by a snake goaded by a hot poker through a drinking horn into Raud&#x27;s mouth and down his throat. Eyvind Kinnrifi likewise refused and was killed by a brazier of hot coals resting on his belly. The possibly apocryphal figure, Sigrid the Haughty was said to have refused to marry Olaf if it meant forgoing her forefathers&#x27; religion, upon which Olaf slapped her with his glove, an act that prompted her to unite his enemies against him years later.

<text>Magnus Olafsson (; Norwegian and Danish: &quot;Magnus Olavsson&quot;; – 25 October 1047), better known as Magnus the Good (; Norwegian and Danish: &quot;Magnus den gode&quot;), was King of Norway from 1035 and King of Denmark from 1042 until his death in 1047.

Magnus was an illegitimate son of Saint Olaf, and fled with his mother Alfhild when his father was dethroned in 1028. He returned to Norway in 1035 and was crowned king at the age of 11. In 1042, he was also crowned king of Denmark. Magnus ruled the two countries until 1047, when he died under unclear circumstances. After his death, his kingdom was split between Harald Hardrada in Norway and Sweyn Estridsson in Denmark.

==Early life==
Magnus was an illegitimate son of King Olaf Haraldsson (later Saint Olaf) by his English concubine Alfhild, originally a slave (thrall) of Olaf&#x27;s queen Astrid Olofsdotter. Born prematurely, the child was weak and unable to breathe for the first few minutes, and he was probably not expected to survive. Olaf was not present at the child&#x27;s birth, and his Icelandic skald Sigvatr Þórðarson became his godfather. In a hasty baptism, Sigvatr named Magnus after the greatest king he knew of, also Olaf&#x27;s greatest role model, &quot;Karla Magnus&quot;, or Charlemagne. Against the odds, Magnus went on to grow strong and healthy, and he became of vital importance to Olaf as his only son.

Olaf was dethroned by the Danish king Cnut the Great in 1028, and he went into exile with his family and court, including the young Magnus. They travelled over the mountains and through Eidskog during the winter, entered Värmland, and were given shelter by a chieftain called Sigtrygg in Närke. After a few months, they departed Närke, and by March went eastwards towards Sigtuna, where the Swedish king Anund Jacob had left them a ship. The party thereafter sailed through the Baltic Sea and into the Gulf of Finland, eventually landing in Kievan Rus&#x27; (&quot;Garðaríki&quot;). They made their first stop at Staraya Ladoga (&quot;Aldeigjuborg&quot;) to organise the further journey. From there they travelled southwards to Novgorod (&quot;Holmgard&quot;), where Olaf sought assistance from Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise. Yaroslav, however, did not want to become directly involved in the Scandinavian power-struggles, and declined to help. After some time, in early 1030, Olaf learned that the Earl of Lade Håkon Eiriksson, Cnut&#x27;s regent in Norway, had disappeared at sea, and gathered his men to make a swift return to Norway. Magnus was left to be fostered by Yaroslav and his wife Ingegerd.

In early 1031, a party including Magnus&#x27;s uncle Harald Sigurdsson (later also to be king and then known as Harald Hardrada) arrived to report the news of his father&#x27;s death at the Battle of Stiklestad. For the next few years, Magnus was educated in Old Russian and some Greek and was trained as a warrior. In 1030, Cnut appointed his first wife Ælfgifu and their son Svein as regents, but the Norwegians found their rule oppressive and, by the time of Cnut&#x27;s death in 1035, they had been driven out and Magnus was established as king. Einar Thambarskelfir and Kalf Arnesson, who had both sought to be appointed regents under Cnut after Olaf&#x27;s death in 1030, had gone together to Kievan Rus&#x27; to bring the boy back to rule as the King of Norway. After receiving the approval of Ingegerd, they returned with Magnus to Sigtuna in early 1035, and received backing from the Swedish king, brother of Magnus&#x27;s stepmother Astrid. Astrid immediately became an important supporter of Magnus, and an army was gathered in Sweden, headed by Einar and Kalf, to place Magnus on the Norwegian throne.

==King of Norway and Denmark==
Magnus was proclaimed king in 1035 at 11 years of age. At first, Magnus sought revenge against his father&#x27;s enemies, but on Sigvatr&#x27;s advice, he stopped doing so, which is why he became known as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;noble&quot;.

Another son of Cnut, Harthacnut, was on the throne of Denmark and wanted his country to reunite with Norway, while Magnus initiated a campaign against Denmark around 1040. However, the noblemen of both countries brought the two kings together at the Göta älv. They made peace and agreed that the first of them to die would be succeeded by the other. In 1042, Harthacnut died while in England, and Magnus also became King of Denmark, in spite of a claim by Cnut&#x27;s nephew Sweyn Estridsen, whom Harthacnut had left in control of Denmark when he went to England, and who had some support.

As part of consolidating his control, Magnus destroyed the Jomsborg, headquarters of the Jomsvikings. Sweyn fled east and returned as one of the leaders of an invasion by the Wends in 1043, which Magnus decisively defeated at the Battle of Lyrskov Heath, near Hedeby. In the battle, Magnus wielded Saint Olaf&#x27;s battle-axe, named Hel after the goddess of death. He had dreamt of his father the night before, and the Norwegians swore that before the battle they could hear the bell that Saint Olaf had given to the Church of St. Clement in Kaupang, in Nidaros—a sign that the saint was watching over his son and the army. It was the greatest victory ever over the Wends, with up to 15,000 killed.

Sweyn continued to oppose Magnus in Denmark, although according to &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, they reached a settlement by which Sweyn became Earl of Denmark under Magnus.

Magnus wanted to reunite Cnut the Great&#x27;s entire North Sea Empire by also becoming king of England. When Harthacnut died, the English nobles had chosen as their king Æthelred the Unready&#x27;s son Edward (later known as Edward the Confessor); Magnus wrote to him that he intended to attack England with combined Norwegian and Danish forces and &quot;he will then govern it who wins the victory.&quot; The English were mostly hostile to Magnus; Sweyn was made welcome there, although Edward&#x27;s mother, Emma, curiously favored Magnus and in 1043 the king confiscated her property, with which by one report she had promised to assist Magnus.

Meanwhile, Magnus&#x27; uncle Harald Sigurdsson had returned to Norway from the east and contested his rule there, while Sweyn was still a threat in Denmark; Harald allied himself with Sweyn. Magnus chose to appease Harald, and made him his co-king in Norway in 1046.

==Death==
Sweyn increased the pressure on Magnus from his base in Scania, but by late 1046, Magnus had driven Sweyn out of Denmark. However, on 25 October 1047, Magnus suddenly died while in Denmark, either in Zealand or in Jutland, either in an accident or of a disease; accounts vary. Reports include falling overboard from one of the ships he was mustering to invade England and drowning, falling off a horse, and falling ill while on board a ship. He is said to have made Sweyn his heir in Denmark, and Harald in Norway; some say in a deathbed statement. Magnus was buried with his father in the cathedral at Nidaros, modern Trondheim.

==Physical appearance==
Heimskringla describes Magnus as &quot;of middle height, with regular features and light complexion. He had light blond hair, was well spoken and quick to make up his mind, was of noble character, most generous, a great warrior, and most valorous.&quot;

==Descendants==
The line of Olaf II ended with Magnus&#x27; death. However, in 1280, Eric II of Norway, who was descended through his mother from Magnus&#x27; legitimate sister, Wulfhild, was crowned king of Norway.

Magnus was not married, but had a daughter out of wedlock, , who married , a Norwegian nobleman. Ragnhild and Haakon had daughters Sunniva and Ragnhild. Sunniva had a son Hakon Sunnivasson, whose son became King Eric III of Denmark. Ragnhild married Paul Thorfinnsson, Earl of Orkney, and together they were the parents of Haakon Paulsson, who also became an earl of Orkney.

His music was largely ignored during his early career, and many of his works went unperformed for many years. Later in life, the quality of his music was publicly recognized through the efforts of contemporaries like Henry Cowell and Lou Harrison, and he came to be regarded as an &quot;American original&quot;. He was also among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones. His experimentation foreshadowed many musical innovations that were later more widely adopted during the 20th century. Hence, he is often regarded as the leading American composer of art music of the 20th century.

Sources of Ives&#x27;s tonal imagery included hymn tunes and traditional songs; he also incorporated melodies of the town band at holiday parade, the fiddlers at Saturday night dances, patriotic songs, sentimental parlor ballads, and the melodies of Stephen Foster.

==Biography==
Ives was born in Danbury, Connecticut, on October 20, 1874, the son of George (Edward) Ives (August 3, 1845 – November 4, 1894), a US Army bandleader in the American Civil War, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Ives (née Parmelee, January 2, 1849 or 1850 – January 25, 1929). The Iveses, descended from founding colonists of Connecticut, were one of Danbury&#x27;s leading families, and they were prominent in business and civic improvement. They were similarly active in progressive social movements of the 19th century, including the abolition of slavery.

George Ives directed bands, choirs, and orchestras, and taught music theory and a number of instruments. Charles got his influences by sitting in the Danbury town square and listening to his father&#x27;s marching band and other bands on other sides of the square simultaneously. His father taught him and his brother (Joseph) Moss Ives (February 5, 1876 – April 7, 1939) music, teaching harmony and counterpoint and guided his first compositions; George took an open-minded approach to theory, encouraging him to experiment in bitonal and polytonal harmonizations. It was from him that Ives also learned the music of Stephen Foster. He became a church organist at the age of 14 and wrote various hymns and songs for church services, including his &quot;Variations on &quot;America&quot;&quot;, which he wrote for a Fourth of July concert in Brewster, New York. It is considered challenging even by modern concert organists, but he famously spoke of it as being &quot;as much fun as playing baseball&quot;, a commentary on his own organ technique at that age.
Ives moved to New Haven, Connecticut, in 1893, enrolling in the Hopkins School, where he captained the baseball team. In September 1894, Ives entered Yale University, studying under Horatio Parker. Here he composed in a choral style similar to his mentor, writing church music and even an 1896 campaign song for William McKinley. On November 4, 1894, his father died, a crushing blow to him, but to a large degree, he continued the musical experimentation he had begun with him. His brother Moss later became a lawyer.

At Yale, Ives was a prominent figure; he was a member of HeBoule, Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter) and Wolf&#x27;s Head Society, and sat as chairman of the Ivy Committee. He enjoyed sports at Yale and played on the varsity American football team. Michael C. Murphy, his coach, once remarked that it was a &quot;crying shame&quot; that he spent so much time at music as otherwise he could have been a champion sprinter. His works &quot;Calcium Light Night&quot; and &quot;Yale-Princeton Football Game&quot; show the influence of college and sports on Ives&#x27;s composition. He wrote his Symphony No. 1 as his senior thesis under Parker&#x27;s supervision. Ives continued his work as a church organist until May 1902.
Soon after he graduated from Yale in 1898, he started work in the actuarial department of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. In 1899, Ives moved to employment with the insurance agency Charles H. Raymond &amp; Co., where he stayed until 1906. In 1907, upon the failure of Raymond &amp; Co., he and his friend Julian Myrick formed their own insurance agency Ives &amp; Co., which later became Ives &amp; Myrick, where he remained until he retired.

During his career as an insurance executive and actuary, Ives devised creative ways to structure life-insurance packages for people of means, which laid the foundation of the modern practice of estate planning. His &quot;Life Insurance with Relation to Inheritance Tax&quot;, published in 1918, was well received. As a result of this he achieved considerable fame in the insurance industry of his time, with many of his business peers surprised to learn that he was also a composer. In his spare time, he composed music and, until his marriage, worked as an organist in Danbury and New Haven as well as Bloomfield, New Jersey, and New York City.

In 1907, Ives suffered the first of several &quot;heart attacks&quot; (as he and his family called them) that he had throughout his life. These attacks may have been psychological in origin rather than physical. Stuart Feder questions the legitimacy of these heart attacks, as he could not find any medical confirmation of them in previous reports. According to Feder, &quot;For the only reliable information tells us that he suffered from palpitations, not pain, the cardinal symptom of heart attack.&quot; Following his recovery from the 1907 attack, Ives entered into one of the most creative periods of his life as a composer.

In 1908, he married Harmony Twichell, daughter of Congregational minister Joseph Twichell and his wife, Julia Harmony Cushman. The young couple moved into their own apartment in New York.

Ives had a successful career in insurance. He also continued to be a prolific composer until he suffered another of several heart attacks in 1918, after which he composed very little. He wrote his last piece, the song &quot;Sunrise&quot;, in August 1926. In 1922, Ives published his &quot;114 Songs&quot;, which represents the breadth of his work as a composer—it includes art songs, songs he wrote as a teenager and young man, and highly dissonant songs such as &quot;The Majority&quot;.

According to his wife, one day in early 1927, Ives came downstairs with tears in his eyes. He could compose no more, he said; &quot;nothing sounds right&quot;. There have been numerous theories advanced to explain the silence of his late years. It seems as mysterious as the last several decades of the life of Jean Sibelius, who stopped composing at almost the same time. While Ives had stopped composing, and was increasingly plagued by health problems, he continued to revise and refine his earlier work, as well as oversee premieres of his music.

After continuing health problems, including diabetes, in 1930 he retired from his insurance business. Although he had more time to devote to music, he was unable to write any new music. During the 1940s, he revised his &quot;Concord Sonata&quot;, publishing it in 1947 (an earlier version of the sonata and the accompanying prose volume, &quot;Essays Before a Sonata&quot; were privately printed in 1920).

Ives died of a stroke in 1954 in New York City. His widow, who died in 1969 at age 92, bequeathed the royalties from his music to the American Academy of Arts and Letters for the Charles Ives Prize.

==Musical career==

Ives&#x27;s career and dedication to music began when he started playing drums in his father&#x27;s band at a young age. Ives published a large collection of songs, many of which had piano parts. He composed two string quartets and other works of chamber music, though he is now best known for his orchestral music. His work as an organist led him to write &quot;Variations on &quot;America&quot;&quot; in 1891, which he premiered at a recital celebrating the Fourth of July.

He composed four numbered symphonies as well as a number of works with the word &#x27;Symphony&#x27; in their titles, as well as &quot;The Unanswered Question&quot; (1908), written for the unusual combination of trumpet, four flutes, and string quartet. &quot;The Unanswered Question&quot; was influenced by the New England writers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.

Around 1910, Ives began composing his most accomplished works, including the &quot;Holiday Symphony&quot; and &quot;Three Places in New England&quot;. &quot;The Piano Sonata No. 2, Concord, Mass&quot; (known as the &quot;Concord Sonata&quot;), was one of his most notable pieces. He started work on this in 1911 and completed most of it in 1915. However, it was not until 1920 that the piece was published. His revised version was not released until 1947. This piece contains one of the most striking examples of his experimentation. In the second movement, he instructed the pianist to use a piece of wood to create a massive cluster chord. The piece also amply demonstrates Ives&#x27;s fondness for musical quotation: the opening bars of Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony are quoted in each movement. Sinclair&#x27;s catalogue also notes less obvious quotations of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; Sonata and various other works.

Another notable piece of orchestral music Ives completed was his Symphony No. 4, which he worked on from 1910 to 1916, with further revisions in the 1920s. This four-movement symphony is notable for its complexity and vast orchestra. A complete performance of the work was not given until 1965, half a century after it was completed and over a decade after Ives&#x27;s death.

Ives left behind material for an unfinished &quot;Universe Symphony&quot;, which he was unable to complete despite two decades of work. This was due to his health problems as well as his shifting ideas of the work.

==Reception==

Ives&#x27;s music was largely ignored during his life, particularly during the years in which he actively composed. Many of his published works went unperformed even many years after his death in 1954. However, his reputation in more recent years has greatly increased. The Juilliard School commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of his death by performing his music over six days in 2004. His musical experiments, including his increasing use of dissonance, were not well received by his contemporaries. The difficulties in performing the rhythmic complexities in his major orchestral works made them daunting challenges even decades after they were composed.

Early supporters of Ives&#x27;s music included Henry Cowell, Elliott Carter, and Aaron Copland. Cowell&#x27;s periodical &quot;New Music&quot; published a substantial number of Ives&#x27;s scores (with his approval). But for nearly 40 years, Ives had few performances of his music that he did not personally arrange or financially back. He generally used Nicolas Slonimsky as the conductor. After seeing a copy of Ives&#x27;s self-published &quot;114 Songs&quot; during the 1930s, Copland published a newspaper article praising the collection.

Ives began to acquire some public recognition during the 1930s, with performances of a chamber orchestra version of his &quot;Three Places in New England&quot;, both in the US and on tour in Europe by conductor Nicolas Slonimsky. The Town Hall (New York City) premiered his &quot;Concord Sonata&quot; in 1939, featuring pianist John Kirkpatrick. This received favorable commentary in the major New York newspapers. Later, around the time of Ives&#x27;s death in 1954, Kirkpatrick teamed with soprano Helen Boatwright for the first extended recorded recital of Ives&#x27;s songs for the obscure Overtone label (Overtone Records catalog number 7). They recorded a new selection of songs for the Ives Centennial Collection that Columbia Records published in 1974.

In the 1940s, Ives met Lou Harrison, a fan of his music who began to edit and promote it. Most notably, Harrison conducted the premiere of the Symphony No. 3, &quot;The Camp Meeting&quot; (1904) in 1946. The next year, it won Ives the Pulitzer Prize for Music. He gave the prize money away (half of it to Harrison), saying &quot;prizes are for boys, and I&#x27;m all grown up&quot;.

Ives was a generous financial supporter of twentieth-century music, often financing works that were written by other composers. This he did in secret, telling his beneficiaries that his wife wanted him to do so. Nicolas Slonimsky said in 1971, &quot;He financed my entire career&quot;.

At this time, Ives was also promoted by Bernard Herrmann, who worked as a conductor at CBS and in 1940 became principal conductor of the CBS Symphony Orchestra. While there, he championed Ives&#x27;s music. When they met, Herrmann confessed that he had tried his hand at performing the &quot;Concord Sonata&quot;. Ives, who avoided the radio and the phonograph, agreed to make a series of piano recordings from 1933 to 1943. One of the more unusual recordings, made in New York City in 1943, features Ives playing the piano and singing the words to his popular World War I song &quot;They Are There!&quot;, which he composed in 1917. He revised it in 1942–43 for World War II.

Ives&#x27;s piano recordings were later issued in 1974 by Columbia Records on a special LP set for his centenary. New World Records issued 42 tracks of his recordings on CD on April 1, 2006, as &quot;Ives Plays Ives&quot;.

In Canada in the 1950s, the expatriate English pianist Lloyd Powell played a series of concerts including all of Ives&#x27;s piano works, at the University of British Columbia.

Recognition of Ives&#x27;s music steadily increased. He received praise from Arnold Schoenberg, who regarded him as a monument to artistic integrity, and from the New York School of William Schuman. Shortly after Schoenberg&#x27;s death (three years before Ives died), his widow found a note written by her husband. The note had originally been written in 1944 when Schoenberg was living in Los Angeles and teaching at UCLA. It said: &quot;There is a great Man living in this Country – a composer. He has solved the problem how to preserve one&#x27;s self-esteem and to learn. He responds to negligence by contempt. He is not forced to accept praise or blame. His name is Ives.&quot;

Ives reportedly also won the admiration of Gustav Mahler, who said that he was a true musical revolutionary. Mahler was said to have talked of premiering Ives&#x27;s third symphony with the New York Philharmonic, but he died in 1911 before conducting this premiere. The source of this account was Ives; since Mahler died, there was no way to verify whether he had seen the score of the symphony or decided to perform it in the 1911–12 season. Ives regularly attended New York Philharmonic concerts and probably heard Mahler conduct the Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall.
In 1951, Leonard Bernstein conducted the world premiere of Ives&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 in a broadcast concert by the New York Philharmonic. The Iveses heard the performance on their cook&#x27;s radio and were amazed at the audience&#x27;s warm reception to the music. Bernstein continued to conduct Ives&#x27;s music and made a number of recordings with the Philharmonic for Columbia Records. He honored Ives on one of his televised youth concerts and in a special disc included with the reissue of the 1960 recording of the second symphony and the &quot;Fourth of July&quot; movement from Ives&#x27;s &quot;Holiday Symphony&quot;.

Another pioneering Ives recording, undertaken during the 1950s, was the first complete set of the four violin sonatas, performed by Minneapolis Symphony concertmaster Rafael Druian and John Simms. Leopold Stokowski took on Symphony No. 4 in 1965, regarding the work as &quot;the heart of the Ives problem&quot;. The Carnegie Hall world premiere by the American Symphony Orchestra led to the first recording of the music. Another promoter of his was choral conductor Gregg Smith, who made a series of recordings of his shorter works during the 1960s. These included the first stereo recordings of the psalm settings and arrangements of many short pieces for theater orchestra. The Juilliard String Quartet recorded the two string quartets during the 1960s.

In the early 21st century, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas is an enthusiastic exponent of Ives&#x27;s symphonies, as is composer and biographer Jan Swafford. Ives&#x27;s work is regularly programmed in Europe. He has also inspired pictorial artists, most notably Eduardo Paolozzi, who entitled one of his 1970s sets of prints &quot;Calcium Light Night&quot;, each print being named for an Ives piece (including &quot;Central Park in the Dark&quot;). In 1991, Connecticut&#x27;s legislature designated Ives as that state&#x27;s official composer.

The Scottish baritone Henry Herford began a survey of Ives&#x27;s songs in 1990, but this remains incomplete. The record company involved (Unicorn-Kanchana) collapsed. Pianist-composer and Wesleyan University professor Neely Bruce has made a life&#x27;s study of Ives. To date, he has staged seven parts of a concert series devoted to the complete songs of Ives. Musicologist David Gray Porter reconstructed a piano concerto, the &quot;Emerson&quot; Concerto, from Ives&#x27;s sketches. A recording of the work was released by Naxos Records.

American singer and composer Frank Zappa included Charles Ives in a list of influences that he presented in the liner notes of his debut album &quot;Freak Out!&quot; (1966). Ives continues to influence contemporary composers, arrangers and musicians. Planet Arts Records released &quot;.&quot; Ives befriended and encouraged a young Elliott Carter. In addition, Phil Lesh, bassist of the Grateful Dead, described Ives as one of his two musical heroes. Jazz musician Albert Ayler also named Charles Ives as an influence in a 1970 interview with &quot;Swing Journal&quot;.

American microtonal musician and composer Johnny Reinhard reconstructed and performed &quot;Universe symphony&quot; in 1996.

&quot;The Unanswered Ives&quot; is an hour-long film documentary directed by Anne-Kathrin Peitz and produced by Accentus Music (Leipzig, Germany). This was released in 2018 and shown on Swedish and German television stations; it features interviews with Jan Swafford, John Adams, James Sinclair and Jack Cooper.

In 1965, Ives won a Grammy Award for his composition Symphony No. 4 and the American Symphony Orchestra won for their recording of the work. Ives had previously been nominated in 1964 for &quot;New England Holidays&quot; and in 1960 for Symphony No. 2.

Igor Stravinsky praised Ives. In 1966 he said: &quot;[Ives] was exploring the 1960s during the heyday of Strauss and Debussy. Polytonality; atonality; tone clusters; perspectivistic effects; chance; statistical composition; permutation; add-a-part, practical-joke, and improvisatory music: these were Ives’s discoveries a half-century ago as he quietly set about devouring the contemporary cake before the rest of us even found a seat at the same table.&quot;

John Cage expressed his admiration for Ives in &quot;Two Statements on Ives&quot;, writing &quot;I think that Ives&#x27;s relevance increases as time goes on&quot; and stating that &quot;his contribution to American music was in every sense &#x27;not only spiritual, by also concretely musical.&#x27; Nowadays everything I hear by Ives delights me.&quot; Cage recalled that during the 1930s, he was &quot;not interested in Ives because of the inclusion in his music of aspects of American folk and popular material&quot;. but that once he began to focus on indeterminacy, he &quot;was able to approach Ives in an entirely different... spirit.&quot; Cage noted that Ives &quot;knew that if sound sources came from different points in space that that fact was in itself interesting. Nobody before him had thought about this...&quot; and stated that &quot;the freedom that he gave to a performer saying Do this or do that according to your choice is directly in line with present indeterminate music.&quot; Cage also expressed his interest in what he called the &quot;mud of Ives&quot;, by which he meant &quot;the part that is not referential...&quot; from which arises a &quot;complex superimposition [of] lines that makes a web in which we cannot clearly perceive anything...&quot; leading to &quot;the possibility of not knowing what&#x27;s happening...&quot; Cage wrote that &quot;more and more... I think this experience of non-knowledge is more useful and more important to us than the Renaissance notion of knowing A B C D E F...&quot; Cage also praised Ives&#x27;s &quot;understanding... of inactivity and of silence...&quot; and recalled having read an essay in which:
Conductor Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic won a Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance for &quot;Ives&#x27;s Complete Symphonies&quot; (Deutsche Grammophon, recorded in 2020).

There is evidence that Ives backdated his scores to sound more modern than he really was. This was first proposed by Maynard Solomon, an advocate of Ives&#x27;s music. This has, in turn, generated some controversy and puzzlement.

==Compositions==
&quot;Note: Because Ives often made several different versions of the same piece, and because his work was generally ignored during his life, it is often difficult to put exact dates on his compositions. The dates given here are sometimes best guesses. There have also been controversial speculations that he purposefully misdated his own pieces earlier or later than actually written.&quot;

==Politics==
Ives proposed in 1920 that there be a 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would authorize citizens to submit legislative proposals to Congress. Members of Congress would then cull the proposals, selecting 10 each year as referendums for popular vote by the nation&#x27;s electorate. He even had printed at his own expense several thousand copies of a pamphlet on behalf of his proposed amendment. The pamphlet proclaimed the need to curtail &quot;THE EFFECTS OF TOO MUCH POLITICS IN OUR representative DEMOCRACY&quot;. He planned to distribute the pamphlets at the 1920 Republican National Convention, but they arrived from the printer after the convention had ended.

It is stated in the biographical film &quot;A Good Dissonance Like a Man&quot; that the first of Ives&#x27;s crippling heart attacks occurred as a result of a World War I-era argument with a young Franklin D. Roosevelt over his idea of issuing of war bonds in amounts as low as $50 each. Roosevelt was chairman of a war bonds committee on which Ives served, and he &quot;scorned the idea of anything so useless as a $50 bond&quot;. Roosevelt changed his mind about small contributions as seen many years later when he endorsed the March of Dimes to combat poliomyelitis.

==In popular culture==

Charles Ives and his wife Harmony (née Twichell) Ives were the subjects of the opera &quot;Harmony&quot; (2021) by Robert Carl and Russell Banks, which was premiered by the Seagle Festival in August 2021. Charles Ives was played by baritone Joel Clemens and Harmony Twitchell was played by soprano Victoria Erickson.

<doc id="66284" wikidata="Q161233" url="?curid=66284" title="Formic acid">
<text>Formic acid (), systematically named methanoic acid, is the simplest carboxylic acid, and has the chemical formula HCOOH and structure . It is an important intermediate in chemical synthesis and occurs naturally, most notably in some ants. Esters, salts and the anion derived from formic acid are called formates. Industrially, formic acid is produced from methanol.

==Natural occurrence==
Formic acid is found naturally in insects, weeds, fruits and vegetables, and forest emissions. It appears in most ants and in stingless bees of the genus &quot;Oxytrigona&quot;. Wood ants from the genus &quot;Formica&quot; can spray formic acid on their prey or to defend the nest. The puss moth caterpillar (&quot;Cerura vinula&quot;) will spray it as well when threatened by predators. It is also found in the trichomes of stinging nettle (&quot;Urtica dioica&quot;). Apart from that, this acid is incorporated in many fruits such as pineapple (0.21 mg per 100 g), apple (2 mg per 100 g) and kiwi (1 mg per 100 g), as well as in many vegetables, namely onion (45 mg per 100 g), eggplant (1.34 mg per 100 g) and, in extremely low concentrations, cucumber (0.11 mg per 100 g). Formic acid is a naturally occurring component of the atmosphere primarily due to forest emissions.

==History==
As early as the 15th century, some alchemists and naturalists were aware that ant hills give off an acidic vapor. The first person to describe the isolation of this substance (by the distillation of large numbers of ants) was the English naturalist John Ray, in 1671. Ants secrete the formic acid for attack and defense purposes. Formic acid was first synthesized from hydrocyanic acid by the French chemist Joseph Gay-Lussac. In 1855, another French chemist, Marcellin Berthelot, developed a synthesis from carbon monoxide similar to the process used today.

Formic acid was long considered a chemical compound of only minor interest in the chemical industry. In the late 1960s, significant quantities became available as a byproduct of acetic acid production. It now finds increasing use as a preservative and antibacterial in livestock feed.

==Properties==

Formic acid is a colorless liquid having a pungent, penetrating odor at room temperature, comparable to the related acetic acid. Formic acid is about ten times stronger than acetic acid.

It is miscible with water and most polar organic solvents, and is somewhat soluble in hydrocarbons. In hydrocarbons and in the vapor phase, it consists of hydrogen-bonded dimers rather than individual molecules. Owing to its tendency to hydrogen-bond, gaseous formic acid does not obey the ideal gas law. Solid formic acid, which can exist in either of two polymorphs, consists of an effectively endless network of hydrogen-bonded formic acid molecules. Formic acid forms a high-boiling azeotrope with water (107.3 °C; 77.5% formic acid). Liquid formic acid tends to supercool.
==Chemical reactions==

===Decomposition===
Formic acid readily decomposes by dehydration in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid to form carbon monoxide and water:
:HCO2H → H2O + CO

Treatment of formic acid with sulfuric acid is a convenient laboratory source of CO. 

In the presence of platinum, it decomposes with a release of hydrogen and carbon dioxide.
:HCO2H → H2 + CO2
Soluble ruthenium catalysts are also effective for producing carbon monoxide-free hydrogen.

===Reactant===
Formic acid shares most of the chemical properties of other carboxylic acids. Because of its high acidity, solutions in alcohols form esters spontaneously; in Fischer esterifications of formic acid, it self-catalyzes the reaction and no additional acid catalyst is needed. Formic acid shares some of the reducing properties of aldehydes, reducing solutions of metal oxides to their respective metal.

Formic acid is a source for a formyl group for example in the formylation of &quot;N&quot;-methylaniline to &quot;N&quot;-methylformanilide in toluene.

In synthetic organic chemistry, formic acid is often used as a source of hydride ion, as in the Eschweiler–Clarke reaction:
It is used as a source of hydrogen in transfer hydrogenation, as in the Leuckart reaction to make amines, and (in aqueous solution or in its azeotrope with triethylamine) for hydrogenation of ketones.

===Addition to alkenes===
Formic acid is unique among the carboxylic acids in its ability to participate in addition reactions with alkenes. Formic acids and alkenes readily react to form formate esters. In the presence of certain acids, including sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids, however, a variant of the Koch reaction occurs instead, and formic acid adds to the alkene to produce a larger carboxylic acid.

===Formic acid anhydride===
An unstable formic anhydride, H(C=O)−O−(C=O)H, can be obtained by dehydration of formic acid with &quot;N&quot;,&quot;&quot;-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in ether at low temperature.

==Production==
In 2009, the worldwide capacity for producing formic acid was per year, roughly equally divided between Europe (, mainly in Germany) and Asia (, mainly in China) while production was below per year in all other continents. It is commercially available in solutions of various concentrations between 85 and 99 w/w %. , the largest producers are BASF, Eastman Chemical Company, LC Industrial, and Feicheng Acid Chemicals, with the largest production facilities in Ludwigshafen ( per year, BASF, Germany), Oulu (, Eastman, Finland), Nakhon Pathom (n/a, LC Industrial), and Feicheng (, Feicheng, China). 2010 prices ranged from around €650/tonne (equivalent to around $800/tonne) in Western Europe to $1250/tonne in the United States.

===From methyl formate and formamide===
When methanol and carbon monoxide are combined in the presence of a strong base, the result is methyl formate, according to the chemical equation:
:CH3OH + CO → HCO2CH3

In industry, this reaction is performed in the liquid phase at elevated pressure. Typical reaction conditions are 80 °C and 40 atm. The most widely used base is sodium methoxide. Hydrolysis of the methyl formate produces formic acid:
:HCO2CH3 + H2O → HCOOH + CH3OH

Efficient hydrolysis of methyl formate requires a large excess of water. Some routes proceed indirectly by first treating the methyl formate with ammonia to give formamide, which is then hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid:
:HCO2CH3 + NH3 → HC(O)NH2 + CH3OH
:2 HC(O)NH2 + 2H2O + H2SO4 → 2HCO2H + (NH4)2SO4

A disadvantage of this approach is the need to dispose of the ammonium sulfate byproduct. This problem has led some manufacturers to develop energy-efficient methods of separating formic acid from the excess water used in direct hydrolysis. In one of these processes, used by BASF, the formic acid is removed from the water by liquid-liquid extraction with an organic base.

===Niche and obsolete chemical routes===
====By-product of acetic acid production====
A significant amount of formic acid is produced as a byproduct in the manufacture of other chemicals. At one time, acetic acid was produced on a large scale by oxidation of alkanes, by a process that cogenerates significant formic acid. This oxidative route to acetic acid has declined in importance so that the aforementioned dedicated routes to formic acid have become more important.

====Hydrogenation of carbon dioxide====
The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid has long been studied. This reaction can be conducted homogeneously.
====Oxidation of biomass====
Formic acid can also be obtained by aqueous catalytic partial oxidation of wet biomass by the OxFA process. A Keggin-type polyoxometalate (H5PV2Mo10O40) is used as the homogeneous catalyst to convert sugars, wood, waste paper, or cyanobacteria to formic acid and CO2 as the sole byproduct. Yields of up to 53% formic acid can be achieved.

====Laboratory methods====
In the laboratory, formic acid can be obtained by heating oxalic acid in glycerol followed by steam distillation. Glycerol acts as a catalyst, as the reaction proceeds through a glyceryl oxalate intermediate. If the reaction mixture is heated to higher temperatures, allyl alcohol results. The net reaction is thus:
:C2O4H2 → HCO2H + CO2
Another illustrative method involves the reaction between lead formate and hydrogen sulfide, driven by the formation of lead sulfide.
:Pb(HCOO)2 + H2S → 2HCOOH + PbS

====Electrochemical production====
Formate is formed by the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (in the form of bicarbonate) at a lead cathode at pH 8.6:
: + + 2e− → + 2
or
: + + 2e− → + 
If the feed is and oxygen is evolved at the anode, the total reaction is:
: + → + 1/2 

===Biosynthesis===
Formic acid is named after ants which have high concentrations of the compound in their venom, derived from serine through a 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate intermediate. The conjugate base of formic acid, formate, also occurs widely in nature. An assay for formic acid in body fluids, designed for determination of formate after methanol poisoning, is based on the reaction of formate with bacterial formate dehydrogenase.

== Uses ==
===Agriculture===
A major use of formic acid is as a preservative and antibacterial agent in livestock feed. It arrests certain decay processes and causes the feed to retain its nutritive value longer,

In Europe, it is applied on silage, including fresh hay, to promote the fermentation of lactic acid and to suppress the formation of butyric acid; it also allows fermentation to occur quickly, and at a lower temperature, reducing the loss of nutritional value. It is widely used to preserve winter feed for cattle, and is sometimes added to poultry feed to kill &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria. Use as a preservative for silage and other animal feed constituted 30% of the global consumption in 2009.

Beekeepers use formic acid as a miticide against the tracheal mite (&quot;Acarapis woodi&quot;) and the &quot;Varroa destructor&quot; mite and &quot;Varroa jacobsoni&quot; mite.

===Energy===
Formic acid can be used directly in formic acid fuel cells or indirectly in hydrogen fuel cells.

Electrolytic conversion of electrical energy to chemical fuel has been proposed as a large-scale source of formate by various groups. The formate could be used as feed to modified &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria for producing biomass. Natural methylotroph microbes can feed on formic acid or formate.

Formic acid has been considered as a means of hydrogen storage. The co-product of this decomposition, carbon dioxide, can be rehydrogenated back to formic acid in a second step. Formic acid contains 53 g/L hydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, which is three and a half times as much as compressed hydrogen gas can attain at 350 bar pressure (14.7 g/L). Pure formic acid is a liquid with a flash point of 69 °C, much higher than that of gasoline (−40 °C) or ethanol (13 °C).

It is possible to use formic acid as an intermediary to produce isobutanol from using microbes.

===Soldering===
Formic acid has a potential application in soldering. Due to its capacity to reduce oxide layers, formic acid gas can be blasted at an oxide surface to increase solder wettability.

===Chromatography===
Formic acid is used as a volatile pH modifier in HPLC and capillary electrophoresis. Formic acid is often used as a component of mobile phase in reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis and separation techniques for the separation of hydrophobic macromolecules, such as peptides, proteins and more complex structures including intact viruses. Especially when paired with mass spectrometry detection, formic acid offers several advantages over the more traditionally used phosphoric acid.

===Other uses===
Formic acid is also significantly used in the production of leather, including tanning (23% of the global consumption in 2009), and in dyeing and finishing textiles (9% of the global consumption in 2009) because of its acidic nature. Use as a coagulant in the production of rubber consumed 6% of the global production in 2009.

Formic acid is also used in place of mineral acids for various cleaning products, such as limescale remover and toilet bowl cleaner. Some formate esters are artificial flavorings and perfumes.

Formic acid application has been reported to be an effective treatment for warts.

==Safety==
Formic acid has low toxicity (hence its use as a food additive), with an of 1.8g/kg (tested orally on mice). The concentrated acid is corrosive to the skin.

Formic acid is readily metabolized and eliminated by the body. Nonetheless, it has specific toxic effects; the formic acid and formaldehyde produced as metabolites of methanol are responsible for the optic nerve damage, causing blindness, seen in methanol poisoning. Some chronic effects of formic acid exposure have been documented. Some experiments on bacterial species have demonstrated it to be a mutagen. Chronic exposure in humans may cause kidney damage. Another possible effect of chronic exposure is development of a skin allergy that manifests upon re-exposure to the chemical.

Concentrated formic acid slowly decomposes to carbon monoxide and water, leading to pressure buildup in the containing vessel. For this reason, 98% formic acid is shipped in plastic bottles with self-venting caps.

The hazards of solutions of formic acid depend on the concentration. The following table lists the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals for formic acid solutions:

Formic acid in 85% concentration is flammable, and diluted formic acid is on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration list of food additives. The principal danger from formic acid is from skin or eye contact with the concentrated liquid or vapors. The U.S. OSHA Permissible Exposure Level (PEL) of formic acid vapor in the work environment is 5 parts per million (ppm) of air.

<text>An organic acid is an organic compound with acidic properties. The most common organic acids are the carboxylic acids, whose acidity is associated with their carboxyl group –COOH. Sulfonic acids, containing the group –SO2OH, are relatively stronger acids. Alcohols, with –OH, can act as acids but they are usually very weak. The relative stability of the conjugate base of the acid determines its acidity. Other groups can also confer acidity, usually weakly: the thiol group –SH, the enol group, and the phenol group. In biological systems, organic compounds containing these groups are generally referred to as organic acids.

A few common examples include:
* Lactic acid
* Acetic acid
* Formic acid
* Citric acid
* Oxalic acid
* Uric acid
* Malic acid
* Tartaric acid
* Butyric acid
* Folic acid

==Characteristics==
In general, organic acids are weak acids and do not dissociate completely in water, whereas the strong mineral acids do. Lower molecular mass organic acids such as formic and lactic acids are miscible in water, but higher molecular mass organic acids, such as benzoic acid, are insoluble in molecular (neutral) form.

On the other hand, most organic acids are very soluble in organic solvents. &quot;p&quot;-Toluenesulfonic acid is a comparatively strong acid used in organic chemistry often because it is able to dissolve in the organic reaction solvent.

Exceptions to these solubility characteristics exist in the presence of other substituents that affect the polarity of the compound.

== Applications ==
Simple organic acids like formic or acetic acids are used for oil and gas well stimulation treatments. These organic acids are much less reactive with metals than are strong mineral acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or mixtures of HCl and hydrofluoric acid (HF). For this reason, organic acids are used at high temperatures or when long contact times between acid and pipe are needed.

The conjugate bases of organic acids such as citrate and lactate are often used in biologically compatible buffer solutions.

Citric and oxalic acids are used as rust removal. As acids, they can dissolve the iron oxides, but without damaging the base metal as do stronger mineral acids. In the dissociated form, they may be able to chelate the metal ions, helping to speed removal.

Biological systems create many more complex organic acids such as -lactic, citric, and -glucuronic acids that contain hydroxyl or carboxyl groups. Human blood and urine contain these plus organic acid degradation products of amino acids, neurotransmitters, and intestinal bacterial action on food components. Examples of these categories are alpha-ketoisocaproic, vanilmandelic, and -lactic acids, derived from catabolism of -leucine and epinephrine (adrenaline) by human tissues and catabolism of dietary carbohydrate by intestinal bacteria, respectively. Organic acids (C1–C7) are widely distributed in nature as normal constituents of plants or animal tissues. They are also formed through microbial fermentation of carbohydrates mainly in the large intestine. They are sometimes found in their sodium, potassium, or calcium salts, or even stronger double salts.


=== In food ===
Organic acids are used in food preservation because of their effects on bacteria. The key basic principle on the mode of action of organic acids on bacteria is that non-dissociated (non-ionized) organic acids can penetrate the bacteria cell wall and disrupt the normal physiology of certain types of bacteria that we call &quot;pH-sensitive&quot;, meaning that they cannot tolerate a wide internal and external pH gradient. Among those bacteria are &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot; spp., &quot;C. perfringens&quot;, &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, and &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species.

Upon passive diffusion of organic acids into the bacteria, where the pH is near or above neutrality, the acids will dissociate and raise the bacteria internal pH, leading to situations that will not impair nor stop the growth of bacteria. On the other hand, the anionic part of the organic acids that can escape the bacteria in its dissociated form will accumulate within the bacteria and disrupt few metabolic functions, leading to osmotic pressure increase, incompatible with the survival of the bacteria.

It has been well demonstrated that the state of the organic acids (undissociated or dissociated) is not important to define their capacity to inhibit the growth of bacteria, compared to undissociated acids.

Lactic acid and its salts sodium lactate and potassium lactate are widely used as antimicrobials in food products, in particular, dairy and poultry such as ham and sausages.

=== In nutrition and animal feeds ===
Organic acids have been used successfully in pig production for more than 25 years. Although less research has been done in poultry, organic acids have also been found to be effective in poultry production.

Organic acids added to feeds should be protected to avoid their dissociation in the crop and in the intestine (high pH segments) and reach far into the gastrointestinal tract, where the bulk of the bacteria population is located.

From the use of organic acids in poultry and pigs, one can expect an improvement in performance similar to or better than that of antibiotic growth promoters, without the public health concern, a preventive effect on the intestinal problems like necrotic enteritis in chickens and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; infection in young pigs. Also one can expect a reduction of the carrier state for &quot;Salmonella&quot; species and &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species.

=== Ongoing research ===
In addition to the end uses previously seen, organic acids have been tested for the following applications:

Barbero-López and colleagues tested at the University of Eastern Finland the potential use of three organic acids, acetic, formic and propionic acids, in wood preservation. They showed a high antifungal potential against the decaying fungi tested (brown rotting fungi &quot;Coniophora puteana&quot;, &quot;Rhodonia placenta&quot; and &quot;Gloeophyllum trabeum;&quot; White rotting fungus &quot;Trametes versicolor)&quot; in Petri dish. However, when they treated wood with organic acids, the acids leached out from wood and did not prevent degradation. Additionally, the organic acids&#x27; acidity may have caused chemical degradation on wood. Additionally, in a more recent study, the ecotoxicity of several natural wood preservatives was compared, and the results indicated a very low toxicity of propionic acid.

<doc id="66291" wikidata="Q26080" url="?curid=66291" title="Wadden Sea">
<text>The Wadden Sea ( ; ; or ; ; ; ) is an intertidal zone in the southeastern part of the North Sea. It lies between the coast of northwestern continental Europe and the range of low-lying Frisian Islands, forming a shallow body of water with tidal flats and wetlands. It has a high biological diversity and is an important area for both breeding and migrating birds. In 2009, the Dutch and German parts of the Wadden Sea were inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List and the Danish part was added in June 2014.

The Wadden Sea stretches from Den Helder, in the northwest of the Netherlands, past the great river estuaries of Germany to its northern boundary at Skallingen in Denmark along a total coastline of some and a total area of about . Within the Netherlands, it is bounded from the IJsselmeer by the Afsluitdijk. Historically, the coastal regions were often subjected to large floods, resulting in thousands of deaths, including the Saint Marcellus&#x27; floods of 1219 and 1362, Burchardi flood of 1634 and Christmas Flood of 1717. Some of these also significantly changed the coastline. Numerous dikes and several causeways have been built, and as a result recent floods have resulted in few or no fatalities (even if some dikes rarely and locally have been overrun in recent history). This makes it among the most human-altered habitats on the planet.

== Environment ==
The word &quot;wad&quot; is Frisian and Dutch for &quot;mud flat&quot; (Low German and , ). The area is typified by extensive tidal mud flats, deeper tidal trenches (tidal creeks) and the islands that are contained within this, a region continually contested by land and sea.

The landscape has been formed for a great part by storm tides in the 10th to 14th centuries, overflowing and carrying away former peat land behind the coastal dunes. The present islands are a remnant of the former coastal dunes.

Towards the North Sea the islands are marked by dunes and wide sandy beaches, and towards the Wadden Sea a low, tidal coast. The impact of waves and currents carrying away sediments is slowly changing both land masses and coastlines. For example, the islands of Vlieland and Ameland have moved eastwards through the centuries, having lost land on one side and added it on the other.

== Fauna ==

The Wadden Sea is famous for its rich flora and fauna, especially birds. Hundreds of thousands of waders, ducks, and geese use the area as a migration stopover or wintering site. It is also a rich habitat for gulls and terns, as well as a few species of herons, Eurasian spoonbills and birds-of-prey, including a small and increasing breeding population of white-tailed eagles. However, the biodiversity of Wadden Sea is smaller today than it once was; for birds, greater flamingos and Dalmatian pelicans used to be common as well, at least during the Holocene climatic optimum when the climate was warmer. Due to human activity and a changing environment, species have gone extinct, while others are expected to migrate in.

Larger fish including rays, Atlantic salmon and brown trout are still present in several sections of the Wadden Sea, but others like European sea sturgeon only survive in the region through a reintroduction project. The world&#x27;s only remaining natural population of houting survives in the Danish part of the Wadden Sea and it has been used as a basis for reintroductions further south, but considerable taxonomic confusion remains over its status (whether it is the same as the houting that once lived further south in the Wadden Sea). European oyster once formed large beds in the region and was still present until a few decades ago, when extirpated due to a combination of disease and the continued spread of the invasive Pacific oyster, which now forms large beds in the Wadden Sea. Especially the southwestern part of the Wadden Sea has been greatly reduced. Historically, the Rhine was by far the most important river flowing into this section, but it has been greatly reduced due to dams. As a result, about 90% of all the species that historically inhabited that part of the Wadden Sea are at risk.

The Wadden Sea is an important habitat for both harbour and grey seals. Harbour porpoises and white-beaked dolphins are the sea&#x27;s only resident cetaceans. They were once extinct in the southern part of the sea but have also re-colonized that area again. Many other cetaceans only visit seasonally, or occasionally. In early history, North Atlantic right whales and gray whales (now extinct in the North Atlantic) were present in the region, perhaps using the shallow, calm waters for feeding and breeding. It has been theorized that they were hunted to extinction in this region by shore-based whalers in medieval times. They are generally considered long-extinct in the region, but in the Netherlands, a possible right whale was observed close to beaches on Texel in the West Frisian Islands and off Steenbanken, Schouwen-Duiveland in July 2005. Recent increases in the number of North Atlantic humpback whales and minke whales might have resulted in more visits and possible re-colonization by the species to the areas especially around Marsdiep. Future recovery of once-extinct local bottlenose dolphins is also expected.

== Conservation ==

A number of human-introduced invasive species, including algae, plants, and smaller organisms, are causing negative effects on native species.

Each of the three countries has designated Ramsar sites in the region (see Wadden Sea National Parks).

Although the Wadden Sea is not yet listed as a transboundary Ramsar site, a great part of the Wadden Sea is protected in cooperation of all three countries. The governments of the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany have been working together since 1978 on the protection and conservation of the Wadden Sea. Co-operation covers management, monitoring and research, as well as political matters. Furthermore, in 1982, a Joint Declaration on the Protection of the Wadden Sea was agreed upon to co-ordinate activities and measures for the protection of the Wadden Sea. In 1997, a Trilateral Wadden Sea Plan was adopted.

In 1986, the Wadden Sea Area was declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO.

In June 2009, the Wadden Sea (comprising the Dutch Wadden Sea Conservation Area and the German Wadden Sea National Parks of Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein) was placed on the World Heritage list by UNESCO. A minor boundary modification in 2011 added the Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park to the site, and the Danish part was added to in 2014. The state of Bremen, covering part of the Weser River estuary, is not participating. Conservation efforts are coordinated by the Common Wadden Sea Secretariat, seated in Wilhelmshaven.

== Recreation ==

Many of the islands have been popular seaside resorts since the 19th century.

Mudflat hiking, i.e., walking on the sandy flats at low tide, has become popular in the Wadden Sea.

It is also a popular region for pleasure boating.

== Literature ==

The German part of the Wadden Sea was the setting for the 1903 Erskine Childers novel &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; and Else Ury&#x27;s 1915 novel &quot;Nesthäkchen in the Children&#x27;s Sanitorium&quot;.

== Wadden Sea Region ==
The area bordering the Wadden Sea, including the Frisian islands and the mainland coastal marshes, is also called the Wadden Coast. In Germany the area is referred to as North Sea Coast (&quot;Nordseeküste&quot;). The embanked polderlands and saltmarshes in the Wadden Sea area – including the Elbe Marshes – are referred to in Germany as North Sea coastal marshes (&quot;Nordseemarschen&quot;).

More recent are terms such as Waddenland, Wadden Sea area and Wadden Sea Region. The latter term is generally understood to include all coastal regions around the Wadden Sea that participate in the trilateral cooperation between Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. The entire area is known for its rich cultural heritage, dating back to the Roman Iron Age and the Middle Ages, and largely coincides with the area internationally referred to as Frisia. Between 2002 and 2023 stakeholder organizations and NGOs from the Wadden Sea Region cooperated in a platform or association called the Wadden Sea Forum (WSF).

<text>Reinforcement learning (RL) is an interdisciplinary area of machine learning and optimal control concerned with how an intelligent agent should take actions in a dynamic environment in order to maximize a reward signal. Reinforcement learning is one of the three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Q-learning at its simplest stores data in tables. This approach becomes infeasible as the number of states/actions increases (e.g., if the state space or action space were continuous), as the probability of the agent visiting a particular state and performing a particular action diminishes. 

Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input-output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead, the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the cumulative reward (the feedback of which might be incomplete or delayed). The search for this balance is known as the exploration–exploitation dilemma.

The environment is typically stated in the form of a Markov decision process (MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. The main difference between classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the Markov decision process, and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible. 

== Principles ==
Due to its generality, reinforcement learning is studied in many disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, and statistics. In the operations research and control literature, RL is called &quot;approximate dynamic programming&quot;, or &quot;neuro-dynamic programming.&quot; The problems of interest in RL have also been studied in the theory of optimal control, which is concerned mostly with the existence and characterization of optimal solutions, and algorithms for their exact computation, and less with learning or approximation (particularly in the absence of a mathematical model of the environment).

Basic reinforcement learning is modeled as a Markov decision process:

* A set of environment and agent states (the state space), formula_1;
* A set of actions (the action space), formula_2, of the agent;
* formula_3, the transition probability (at time formula_4) from state formula_5 to state formula_6 under action formula_7.
* formula_8, the immediate reward after transition from formula_5 to formula_6 under action formula_7.

The purpose of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an optimal (or near-optimal) policy that maximizes the reward function or other user-provided reinforcement signal that accumulates from immediate rewards. This is similar to processes that appear to occur in animal psychology. For example, biological brains are hardwired to interpret signals such as pain and hunger as negative reinforcements, and interpret pleasure and food intake as positive reinforcements. In some circumstances, animals learn to adopt behaviors that optimize these rewards. This suggests that animals are capable of reinforcement learning.

A basic reinforcement learning agent interacts with its environment in discrete time steps. At each time step , the agent receives the current state formula_12 and reward formula_13. It then chooses an action formula_14 from the set of available actions, which is subsequently sent to the environment. The environment moves to a new state formula_15 and the reward formula_16 associated with the &quot;transition&quot; formula_17 is determined. The goal of a reinforcement learning agent is to learn a &quot;policy&quot;: 

formula_18, formula_19

that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.

Formulating the problem as a Markov decision process assumes the agent directly observes the current environmental state; in this case, the problem is said to have &quot;full observability&quot;. If the agent only has access to a subset of states, or if the observed states are corrupted by noise, the agent is said to have &quot;partial observability&quot;, and formally the problem must be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process. In both cases, the set of actions available to the agent can be restricted. For example, the state of an account balance could be restricted to be positive; if the current value of the state is 3 and the state transition attempts to reduce the value by 4, the transition will not be allowed.

When the agent&#x27;s performance is compared to that of an agent that acts optimally, the difference in performance yields the notion of regret. In order to act near optimally, the agent must reason about long-term consequences of its actions (i.e., maximize future rewards), although the immediate reward associated with this might be negative.

Thus, reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited to problems that include a long-term versus short-term reward trade-off. It has been applied successfully to various problems, including energy storage, robot control, photovoltaic generators, backgammon, checkers, Go (AlphaGo), and autonomous driving systems.

Two elements make reinforcement learning powerful: the use of samples to optimize performance, and the use of function approximation to deal with large environments. Thanks to these two key components, RL can be used in large environments in the following situations:

* A model of the environment is known, but an analytic solution is not available;
* Only a simulation model of the environment is given (the subject of simulation-based optimization); 
* The only way to collect information about the environment is to interact with it.

The first two of these problems could be considered planning problems (since some form of model is available), while the last one could be considered to be a genuine learning problem. However, reinforcement learning converts both planning problems to machine learning problems.

== Exploration ==
The exploration vs. exploitation trade-off has been most thoroughly studied through the multi-armed bandit problem and for finite state space Markov decision processes in Burnetas and Katehakis (1997).

Reinforcement learning requires clever exploration mechanisms; randomly selecting actions, without reference to an estimated probability distribution, shows poor performance. The case of (small) finite Markov decision processes is relatively well understood. However, due to the lack of algorithms that scale well with the number of states (or scale to problems with infinite state spaces), simple exploration methods are the most practical.

One such method is formula_20-greedy, where formula_21 is a parameter controlling the amount of exploration vs. exploitation. With probability formula_22, exploitation is chosen, and the agent chooses the action that it believes has the best long-term effect (ties between actions are broken uniformly at random). Alternatively, with probability formula_20, exploration is chosen, and the action is chosen uniformly at random. formula_20 is usually a fixed parameter but can be adjusted either according to a schedule (making the agent explore progressively less), or adaptively based on heuristics.

== Algorithms for control learning ==
Even if the issue of exploration is disregarded and even if the state was observable (assumed hereafter), the problem remains to use past experience to find out which actions lead to higher cumulative rewards.

=== Criterion of optimality ===
==== Policy ====
The agent&#x27;s action selection is modeled as a map called &quot;policy&quot;:
:formula_25
:formula_26

The policy map gives the probability of taking action formula_7 when in state formula_5. There are also deterministic policies.

==== State-value function ====
The state-value function formula_29 is defined as, &quot;expected discounted return&quot; starting with state formula_5, i.e. formula_31, and successively following policy formula_32. Hence, roughly speaking, the value function estimates &quot;how good&quot; it is to be in a given state.

:formula_33

where the random variable formula_34 denotes the discounted return, and is defined as the sum of future discounted rewards:

:formula_35

where formula_16 is the reward for transitioning from state formula_12 to formula_15, formula_39 is the discount rate. formula_40 is less than 1, so rewards in the distant future are weighted less than rewards in the immediate future.

The algorithm must find a policy with maximum expected discounted return. From the theory of Markov decision processes it is known that, without loss of generality, the search can be restricted to the set of so-called &quot;stationary&quot; policies. A policy is &quot;stationary&quot; if the action-distribution returned by it depends only on the last state visited (from the observation agent&#x27;s history). The search can be further restricted to &quot;deterministic&quot; stationary policies. A &quot;deterministic stationary&quot; policy deterministically selects actions based on the current state. Since any such policy can be identified with a mapping from the set of states to the set of actions, these policies can be identified with such mappings with no loss of generality.

=== Brute force ===
The brute force approach entails two steps:
* For each possible policy, sample returns while following it
* Choose the policy with the largest expected discounted return

One problem with this is that the number of policies can be large, or even infinite. Another is that the variance of the returns may be large, which requires many samples to accurately estimate the discounted return of each policy.

These problems can be ameliorated if we assume some structure and allow samples generated from one policy to influence the estimates made for others. The two main approaches for achieving this are value function estimation and direct policy search.

=== Value function ===

Value function approaches attempt to find a policy that maximizes the discounted return by maintaining a set of estimates of expected discounted returns formula_41 for some policy (usually either the &quot;current&quot; [on-policy] or the optimal [off-policy] one).

These methods rely on the theory of Markov decision processes, where optimality is defined in a sense stronger than the one above: A policy is optimal if it achieves the best-expected discounted return from &quot;any&quot; initial state (i.e., initial distributions play no role in this definition). Again, an optimal policy can always be found among stationary policies.

To define optimality in a formal manner, define the state-value of a policy formula_32 by

:formula_43

where formula_34 stands for the discounted return associated with following formula_32 from the initial state formula_5. Defining formula_47 as the maximum possible state-value of formula_48, where formula_32 is allowed to change,

:formula_50

A policy that achieves these optimal state-values in each state is called &quot;optimal&quot;. Clearly, a policy that is optimal in this sense is also optimal in the sense that it maximizes the expected discounted return, since formula_51, where formula_5 is a state randomly sampled from the distribution formula_53 of initial states (so formula_54).

Although state-values suffice to define optimality, it is useful to define action-values. Given a state formula_5, an action formula_7 and a policy formula_32, the action-value of the pair formula_58 under formula_32 is defined by

:formula_60

where formula_34 now stands for the random discounted return associated with first taking action formula_7 in state formula_5 and following formula_32, thereafter.

The theory of Markov decision processes states that if formula_65 is an optimal policy, we act optimally (take the optimal action) by choosing the action from formula_66 with the highest action-value at each state, formula_5. The &quot;action-value function&quot; of such an optimal policy (formula_68) is called the &quot;optimal action-value function&quot; and is commonly denoted by formula_69. In summary, the knowledge of the optimal action-value function alone suffices to know how to act optimally.

Assuming full knowledge of the Markov decision process, the two basic approaches to compute the optimal action-value function are value iteration and policy iteration. Both algorithms compute a sequence of functions formula_70 (formula_71) that converge to formula_69. Computing these functions involves computing expectations over the whole state-space, which is impractical for all but the smallest (finite) Markov decision processes. In reinforcement learning methods, expectations are approximated by averaging over samples and using function approximation techniques to cope with the need to represent value functions over large state-action spaces.

====Monte Carlo methods====
Monte Carlo methods are used to solve reinforcement learning problems by averaging sample returns. Unlike methods that require full knowledge of the environment’s dynamics, Monte Carlo methods rely solely on actual or simulated experience—sequences of states, actions, and rewards obtained from interaction with an environment. This makes them applicable in situations where the complete dynamics are unknown. Learning from actual experience does not require prior knowledge of the environment and can still lead to optimal behavior. When using simulated experience, only a model capable of generating sample transitions is required, rather than a full specification of transition probabilities, which is necessary for dynamic programming methods.

Monte Carlo methods apply to episodic tasks, where experience is divided into episodes that eventually terminate. Policy and value function updates occur only after the completion of an episode, making these methods incremental on an episode-by-episode basis, though not on a step-by-step (online) basis. The term &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; generally refers to any method involving random sampling; however, in this context, it specifically refers to methods that compute averages from &quot;complete&quot; returns, rather than &quot;partial&quot; returns.

These methods function similarly to the bandit algorithms, in which returns are averaged for each state-action pair. The key difference is that actions taken in one state affect the returns of subsequent states within the same episode, making the problem non-stationary. To address this non-stationarity, Monte Carlo methods use the framework of general policy iteration (GPI). While dynamic programming computes value functions using full knowledge of the Markov decision process (MDP), Monte Carlo methods learn these functions through sample returns. The value functions and policies interact similarly to dynamic programming to achieve optimality, first addressing the prediction problem and then extending to policy improvement and control, all based on sampled experience.
====Temporal difference methods ====

The first problem is corrected by allowing the procedure to change the policy (at some or all states) before the values settle. This too may be problematic as it might prevent convergence. Most current algorithms do this, giving rise to the class of &quot;generalized policy iteration&quot; algorithms. Many &quot;actor-critic&quot; methods belong to this category.

The second issue can be corrected by allowing trajectories to contribute to any state-action pair in them. This may also help to some extent with the third problem, although a better solution when returns have high variance is Sutton&#x27;s temporal difference (TD) methods that are based on the recursive Bellman equation. The computation in TD methods can be incremental (when after each transition the memory is changed and the transition is thrown away), or batch (when the transitions are batched and the estimates are computed once based on the batch). Batch methods, such as the least-squares temporal difference method, may use the information in the samples better, while incremental methods are the only choice when batch methods are infeasible due to their high computational or memory complexity. Some methods try to combine the two approaches. Methods based on temporal differences also overcome the fourth issue.

Another problem specific to TD comes from their reliance on the recursive Bellman equation. Most TD methods have a so-called formula_73 parameter formula_74 that can continuously interpolate between Monte Carlo methods that do not rely on the Bellman equations and the basic TD methods that rely entirely on the Bellman equations. This can be effective in palliating this issue.

==== Function approximation methods ====
In order to address the fifth issue, &quot;function approximation methods&quot; are used. &quot;Linear function approximation&quot; starts with a mapping formula_75 that assigns a finite-dimensional vector to each state-action pair. Then, the action values of a state-action pair formula_58 are obtained by linearly combining the components of formula_77 with some &quot;weights&quot; formula_78:

:formula_79

The algorithms then adjust the weights, instead of adjusting the values associated with the individual state-action pairs. Methods based on ideas from nonparametric statistics (which can be seen to construct their own features) have been explored.

Value iteration can also be used as a starting point, giving rise to the Q-learning algorithm and its many variants. Including Deep Q-learning methods when a neural network is used to represent Q, with various applications in stochastic search problems.

The problem with using action-values is that they may need highly precise estimates of the competing action values that can be hard to obtain when the returns are noisy, though this problem is mitigated to some extent by temporal difference methods. Using the so-called compatible function approximation method compromises generality and efficiency.

=== Direct policy search ===
An alternative method is to search directly in (some subset of) the policy space, in which case the problem becomes a case of stochastic optimization. The two approaches available are gradient-based and gradient-free methods.

Gradient-based methods (&quot;policy gradient methods&quot;) start with a mapping from a finite-dimensional (parameter) space to the space of policies: given the parameter vector formula_78, let formula_81 denote the policy associated to formula_78. Defining the performance function by formula_83 under mild conditions this function will be differentiable as a function of the parameter vector formula_78. If the gradient of formula_85 was known, one could use gradient ascent. Since an analytic expression for the gradient is not available, only a noisy estimate is available. Such an estimate can be constructed in many ways, giving rise to algorithms such as Williams&#x27;s REINFORCE method (which is known as the likelihood ratio method in the simulation-based optimization literature).

A large class of methods avoids relying on gradient information. These include simulated annealing, cross-entropy search or methods of evolutionary computation. Many gradient-free methods can achieve (in theory and in the limit) a global optimum.

Policy search methods may converge slowly given noisy data. For example, this happens in episodic problems when the trajectories are long and the variance of the returns is large. Value-function based methods that rely on temporal differences might help in this case. In recent years, &quot;actor–critic methods&quot; have been proposed and performed well on various problems.

Policy search methods have been used in the robotics context. Many policy search methods may get stuck in local optima (as they are based on local search).

=== Model-based algorithms ===
Finally, all of the above methods can be combined with algorithms that first learn a model of the Markov decision process, the probability of each next state given an action taken from an existing state. For instance, the Dyna algorithm learns a model from experience, and uses that to provide more modelled transitions for a value function, in addition to the real transitions. Such methods can sometimes be extended to use of non-parametric models, such as when the transitions are simply stored and &quot;replayed&quot; to the learning algorithm.

Model-based methods can be more computationally intensive than model-free approaches, and their utility can be limited by the extent to which the Markov decision process can be learnt.

There are other ways to use models than to update a value function. For instance, in model predictive control the model is used to update the behavior directly.

== Theory ==
Both the asymptotic and finite-sample behaviors of most algorithms are well understood. Algorithms with provably good online performance (addressing the exploration issue) are known.

Efficient exploration of Markov decision processes is given in Burnetas and Katehakis (1997). Finite-time performance bounds have also appeared for many algorithms, but these bounds are expected to be rather loose and thus more work is needed to better understand the relative advantages and limitations.

For incremental algorithms, asymptotic convergence issues have been settled. Temporal-difference-based algorithms converge under a wider set of conditions than was previously possible (for example, when used with arbitrary, smooth function approximation).

== Comparison of key algorithms ==
=== Associative reinforcement learning ===
Associative reinforcement learning tasks combine facets of stochastic learning automata tasks and supervised learning pattern classification tasks. In associative reinforcement learning tasks, the learning system interacts in a closed loop with its environment.

=== Deep reinforcement learning ===
This approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space. The work on learning ATARI games by Google DeepMind increased attention to deep reinforcement learning or end-to-end reinforcement learning.

=== Adversarial deep reinforcement learning ===
Adversarial deep reinforcement learning is an active area of research in reinforcement learning focusing on vulnerabilities of learned policies. In this research area some studies initially showed that reinforcement learning policies are susceptible to imperceptible adversarial manipulations. While some methods have been proposed to overcome these susceptibilities, in the most recent studies it has been shown that these proposed solutions are far from providing an accurate representation of current vulnerabilities of deep reinforcement learning policies.

=== Fuzzy reinforcement learning ===
By introducing fuzzy inference in reinforcement learning, approximating the state-action value function with fuzzy rules in continuous space becomes possible. The IF - THEN form of fuzzy rules make this approach suitable for expressing the results in a form close to natural language. Extending FRL with Fuzzy Rule Interpolation allows the use of reduced size sparse fuzzy rule-bases to emphasize cardinal rules (most important state-action values).

=== Inverse reinforcement learning ===
In inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), no reward function is given. Instead, the reward function is inferred given an observed behavior from an expert. The idea is to mimic observed behavior, which is often optimal or close to optimal. One popular IRL paradigm is named maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MaxEnt IRL). MaxEnt IRL estimates the parameters of a linear model of the reward function by maximizing the entropy of the probability distribution of observed trajectories subject to constraints related to matching expected feature counts. Recently it has been shown that MaxEnt IRL is a particular case of a more general framework named random utility inverse reinforcement learning (RU-IRL). RU-IRL is based on random utility theory and Markov decision processes. While prior IRL approaches assume that the apparent random behavior of an observed agent is due to it following a random policy, RU-IRL assumes that the observed agent follows a deterministic policy but randomness in observed behavior is due to the fact that an observer only has partial access to the features the observed agent uses in decision making. The utility function is modeled as a random variable to account for the ignorance of the observer regarding the features the observed agent actually considers in its utility function.

===Multi-objective reinforcement learning===
Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a form of reinforcement learning concerned with conflicting alternatives. It is distinct from multi-objective optimization in that it is concerned with agents acting in environments.

=== Safe reinforcement learning ===
Safe reinforcement learning (SRL) can be defined as the process of learning policies that maximize the expectation of the return in problems in which it is important to ensure reasonable system performance and/or respect safety constraints during the learning and/or deployment processes. An alternative approach is risk-averse reinforcement learning, where instead of the &quot;expected&quot; return, a &quot;risk-measure&quot; of the return is optimized, such as the conditional value at risk (CVaR). In addition to mitigating risk, the CVaR objective increases robustness to model uncertainties. However, CVaR optimization in risk-averse RL requires special care, to prevent gradient bias and blindness to success.

=== Self-reinforcement learning ===
Self-reinforcement learning (or self-learning), is a learning paradigm which does not use the concept of immediate reward formula_8 after transition from formula_5 to formula_6 with action formula_7. It does not use an external reinforcement, it only uses the agent internal self-reinforcement. The internal self-reinforcement is provided by mechanism of feelings and emotions. In the learning process emotions are backpropagated by a mechanism of secondary reinforcement. The learning equation does not include the immediate reward, it only includes the state evaluation. 

The self-reinforcement algorithm updates a memory matrix formula_90 such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine:
# In situation formula_5 perform action formula_7.
# Receive a consequence situation formula_6.
# Compute state evaluation formula_94 of how good is to be in the consequence situation formula_6.
# Update crossbar memory formula_96.

Initial conditions of the memory are received as input from the genetic environment. It is a system with only one input (situation), and only one output (action, or behavior). 

Self-reinforcement (self-learning) was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-reinforcement learning, named Crossbar Adaptive Array (CAA). The CAA computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence states. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. 

== Statistical comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms ==
Efficient comparison of RL algorithms is essential for research, deployment and monitoring of RL systems. To compare different algorithms on a given environment, an agent can be trained for each algorithm. Since the performance is sensitive to implementation details, all algorithms should be implemented as closely as possible to each other. After the training is finished, the agents can be run on a sample of test episodes, and their scores (returns) can be compared. Since episodes are typically assumed to be i.i.d, standard statistical tools can be used for hypothesis testing, such as T-test and permutation test. This requires to accumulate all the rewards within an episode into a single number - the episodic return. However, this causes a loss of information, as different time-steps are averaged together, possibly with different levels of noise. Whenever the noise level varies across the episode, the statistical power can be improved significantly, by weighting the rewards according to their estimated noise.

<text>Chinese art is visual art that originated in or is practiced in China, Greater China or by Chinese artists. Art created by Chinese residing outside of China can also be considered a part of Chinese art when it is based on or draws on Chinese culture, heritage, and history. Early &quot;Stone Age art&quot; dates back to 10,000 BC, mostly consisting of simple pottery and sculptures. After that period, Chinese art, like Chinese history, was typically classified by the succession of ruling dynasties of Chinese emperors, most of which lasted several hundred years. The Palace Museum in Beijing and the National Palace Museum in Taipei contains extensive collections of Chinese art.

Chinese art is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and consciousness of, tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western collapse and gradual recovery of Western classical styles of art. Decorative arts are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially unknown artists, especially in Chinese ceramics.

Much of the best work in ceramics, textiles, carved lacquer were produced over a long period by the various Imperial factories or workshops, which as well as being used by the court was distributed internally and abroad on a huge scale to demonstrate the wealth and power of the Emperors. In contrast, the tradition of ink wash painting, practiced mainly by scholar-officials and court painters especially of landscapes, flowers, and birds, developed aesthetic values depending on the individual imagination of and objective observation by the artist that are similar to those of the West, but long pre-dated their development there. After contacts with Western art became increasingly important from the 19th century onwards, in recent decades China has participated with increasing success in worldwide contemporary art.

==History and development==
===Neolithic pottery===
Early forms of art in China are found in the Neolithic Yangshao culture, which dates back to the 6th millennium BC. Archeological findings such as those at the Banpo have revealed that the Yangshao made pottery; early ceramics were unpainted and most often cord-marked. The first decorations were fish and human faces, but these eventually evolved into symmetrical-geometric abstract designs, some painted.

The most distinctive feature of Yangshao culture was the extensive use of painted pottery, especially human facial, animal, and geometric designs. Unlike the later Longshan culture, the Yangshao culture did not use pottery wheels in pottery making. Excavations have found that children were buried in painted pottery jars.

===Jade culture===

The Liangzhu culture was the last Neolithic Jade culture in the Yangtze River Delta and was spaced over a period of about 1,300 years. The Jade from this culture is characterized by finely worked, large ritual jades such as Cong cylinders, Bi discs, Yue axes and also pendants and decorations in the form of chiseled open-work plaques, plates and representations of small birds, turtles and fish. The Liangzhu Jade has a white, milky bone-like aspect due to its tremolite rock origin and influence of water-based fluids at the burial sites.

=== Bronze casting ===


The Bronze Age in China began with the Xia dynasty. Examples from this period have been recovered from ruins of the Erlitou culture, in Shanxi, and include complex but unadorned utilitarian objects. In the following Shang dynasty more elaborate objects, including many ritual vessels, were crafted. The Shang are remembered for their bronze casting, noted for its clarity of detail. Shang bronzesmiths usually worked in foundries outside the cities to make ritual vessels, and sometimes weapons and chariot fittings as well. The bronze vessels were receptacles for storing or serving various solids and liquids used in the performance of sacred ceremonies. Some forms such as the &quot;ku&quot; and &quot;jue&quot; can be very graceful, but the most powerful pieces are the &quot;ding&quot;, sometimes described as having an &quot;air of ferocious majesty&quot;.

It is typical of the developed Shang style that all available space is decorated, most often with stylized forms of real and imaginary animals. The most common motif is the &quot;taotie&quot;, which shows a mythological being presented frontally as though squashed onto a horizontal plane to form a symmetrical design. The early significance of &quot;taotie&quot; is not clear, but myths about it existed around the late Zhou dynasty. It was considered to be variously a covetous man banished to guard a corner of heaven against evil monsters; or a monster equipped with only a head which tries to devour men but hurts only itself.

The function and appearance of bronzes changed gradually from the Shang to the Zhou. They shifted from being used in religious rites to more practical purposes. By the Warring States period, bronze vessels had become objects of aesthetic enjoyment. Some were decorated with social scenes, such as from a banquet or hunt; whilst others displayed abstract patterns inlaid with gold, silver, or precious and semiprecious stones.

Bronze artifacts also have significant meaning and roles in the Han dynasty as well. People used them for funerary purposes which reflect the aesthetic and artistic qualities of the Han dynasty. Many bronze vessels excavated from tombs in Jiangsu Province, China, have various shapes like Ding, Hu, and Xun which represent traditional Chinese aesthete. These vessels are classical representations of Chinese celestial art forms which play a great role in ancient Chinese&#x27;s communication with spirits of their ancestors. Other than the vessels, bronze weapons, daily items, and musical instruments are also found in royal Han families&#x27; tomb in Jiangsu. Being able to put a full set of Bianzhong in ones tomb signifies his or her status and class in the Han dynasty since this particular type of instrument is only acquired and owned by royal and wealth families. Apparently, Bianzhong and music are also used as a path for the Han rulers to communication with their Gods. The excavation of Bianzhong, a typical and royal instrument found in ancient China, emphasizes the development of complex music systems in the Han dynasty. The set of Bianzhong can vary in many cases; for example, a specific excavation of Bianzhong from Jiangsu Province include different sets of bells, like Niuzhong and Yongzhong bells, and many of them appear in animal forms like the dragon, a traditional Chinese spiritual animal.

Shang bronzes became appreciated as works of art from the Song dynasty, when they were collected and prized not only for their shape and design but also for the various green, blue green, and even reddish patinas created by chemical action as they lay buried in the ground. The study of early Chinese bronze casting is a specialized field of art history.

===Zhou dynasty ( – 256 BCE)===
During the Zhou period, few sculptures, especially sculptures of human or animal form, are recorded in the extant archaeology, and there does not appear to have been much of a sculptural tradition. Among the very few such depictions known in China before that date: four wooden figurines from Liangdaicun (梁帶村) in Hancheng (韓城), Shaanxi, possibly dating to the 9th century BCE; two wooden human figurines of foreigners possibly representing sedan chair bearers from a Qin state tomb in Longxian (隴縣), Shaanxi, from about 700 BCE; and more numerous statuettes from around 5th century bronze musicians in a miniature house from Shaoxing (紹興) in Zhejiang; a 4th-century human-shaped lamp stand from Pingshan (平山) county royal tomb, Hebei. The &quot;Taerpo horserider&quot; is a Zhou-era Warrior-State Qin terracotta figurine from a tomb in the Taerpo cemetery (塔兒坡墓) near Xianyang in Shaanxi, dated to the 4th–3rd century BCE. Another nearly-identical statuette is known, from the same tomb. Small holes in his hands suggest that he was originally holding reins in one hand, and a weapon in the other. This is the earliest known representation of a cavalryman in China.

==== Chu and Southern culture (c. 1030 BC – 223 BC) ====
A rich source of art in early China was the state of Chu, which developed in the Yangtze River valley. Excavations of Chu tombs have found painted wooden sculptures, jade disks, glass beads, musical instruments, and an assortment of lacquerware. Many of the lacquer objects are finely painted, red on black or black on red. A site in Changsha, Hunan province, has revealed some of the oldest paintings on silk discovered to date.

=== Early imperial China (221 BCE – 220 CE) ===

==== Qin art ====

The Terracotta Army, inside the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor, consists of more than 7,000 life-size tomb terracotta figures of warriors and horses buried with the self-proclaimed first Emperor of China Qin Shi Huang in 210–209 BC. The figures were painted before being placed into the vault. The original colors were visible when the pieces were first unearthed. However, exposure to air caused the pigments to fade, so today the unearthed figures appear terracotta in color. The figures are in several poses including standing infantry and kneeling archers, as well as charioteers with horses. Each figure&#x27;s head appears to be unique, showing a variety of facial features and expressions as well as hair styles. The spectacular realism displayed by the sculptures is an evidence of the advancement of art during the Qin dynasty. It is without precedent in the historical record of art in East Asia.

A music instrument called Qin zither was developed during the Qin dynasty.
The aesthetic components have always been as important as the functional parts on a musical instrument in Chinese history. The Qin zither has seven strings. Although Qin zither can sometimes remind people of corruptive history times, it is often considered as a delivery of peace and harmony.

==== Han art ====

During the Qin dynasty, Chinese font, measurement systems, currency were all standardized in order to bring further unification. The Great Wall of China was expanded as a defensive construction against the northern intruders. 
The Han dynasty was known for jade burial suits. One of the earliest known depictions of a landscape in Chinese art comes from a pair of hollow-tile door panels from a Western Han dynasty tomb near Zhengzhou, dated 60 BCE. A scene of continuous depth recession is conveyed by the zigzag of lines representing roads and garden walls, giving the impression that one is looking down from the top of a hill. This artistic landscape scene was made by the repeated impression of standard stamps on the clay while it was still soft and not yet fired. However, the oldest known landscape art scene tradition in the classical sense of painting is a work by Zhan Ziqian of the Sui dynasty (581–618).

Other than jade artifacts, bronze is another favorite medium for artists since it is hard and durable. Bronze mirrors have been mass-produced in the Han dynasty (206 BCE220 CE), and almost every tomb excavated that has been dated as Han dynasty has mirror in the burial. The reflective side is usually made by a composition of bronze, copper, tin, and lead. The word &quot;mirror&quot; means &quot;to reflect&quot; or &quot;to look into&quot; in Chinese, so bronze mirrors have been used as a trope for reflecting the reality. The ancient Chinese believe that mirror can act as a representation of the reality, which could make them more aware of the current situation; also, mirrors are used as a media to convey or present a reflection of the past events. The bronze mirrors made in the Han dynasty always have complex decorations on their non-reflective side; some of them consist narratives that tell stories. The narratives themselves always reflect the common but essential theories to the Han people&#x27;s lives.



====First monumental stone sculptures (117 BCE)====

Terracotta statuettes had been known for a long time in China, but there are no known examples of monumental stone statuary before the stone sculptures at the Mausoleum of Huo Qubing (140–117 BCE), a general of Emperor Han Wudi who went to the western regions to fight the Xiongnu. In literary sources, there is only a single 3rd–4th century CE record of a possible earlier example: two alleged monumental stone statues of &quot;qilin&quot; (Chinese unicorns) said have been set up on top of the tomb of the First Emperor Qin Shihuang. The most famous of Huo Qubing&#x27;s statues is that of a horse trampling a Xiongnu warrior.

The Mausoleum of Huo Qubing (located in Maoling, the Mausoleum of Han Wudi) has 15 more stone sculptures. These are less naturalistic than the &quot;Horse trampling a Xiongnu&quot;, and tend to follow the natural shape of the stone, with details of the figures only emerging in high-relief. Following these early attempts, the usage of monumental stone statues would only develop from the end of the Western Han to the Eastern Han.

Monumental stone statuary would become a major art form from the 4–6th centuries CE with the onset of monumental Buddhist sculpture in China.

=== Period of division (220–581) ===

==== Influence of Buddhism ====

Buddhism arrived in China around the 1st century CE (although there are some traditions about a monk visiting China during Asoka&#x27;s reign), and through to the 8th century it became very active and creative in the development of Buddhist art, particularly in the area of statuary. Receiving this distant religion, China soon incorporated strong Chinese traits in its artistic expression.

In the fifth to sixth century the Northern dynasties, rather removed from the original sources of inspiration, tended to develop rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible, realistic manner, progressively led to a research towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.

==== Calligraphy ====
In ancient China, painting and calligraphy were the most highly appreciated arts in court circles and were produced almost exclusively by amateurs, aristocrats and scholar-officials who alone had the leisure to perfect the technique and sensibility necessary for great brushwork. Calligraphy was thought to be the highest and purest form of painting. The implements were the brush, made of animal hair, and black ink made from pine soot and animal glue. Writing as well as painting was done on silk. But after the invention of paper in the 1st century, silk was gradually replaced by the new and cheaper material. Original writings by famous calligraphers have been greatly valued throughout China&#x27;s history and are mounted on scrolls and hung on walls in the same way that paintings are.

Wang Xizhi was a famous Chinese calligrapher who lived in the 4th century AD. His most famous work is the &quot;Lanting Xu&quot;, the preface to a collection of poems. The script was often celebrated as the high point of the semi-cursive &quot;Running Style&quot; in the history of Chinese calligraphy.

Wei Shuo was a well-known calligrapher of the Eastern Jin dynasty who established consequential rules about the regular script. Her well-known works include &quot;Famous Concubine Inscription&quot; (名姬帖 Ming Ji Tie) and &quot;The Inscription of Wei-shi He&#x27;nan&quot; (衛氏和南帖 Wei-shi He&#x27;nan Tie).

==== Painting ====

Gu Kaizhi is a celebrated painter of ancient China born in Wuxi. He wrote three books about painting theory: &quot;On Painting&quot; (畫論), &quot;Introduction of Famous Paintings of Wei and Jin Dynasties&quot; (魏晉名畫記) and &quot;Painting Yuntai Mountain&quot; (畫雲臺山記). He wrote, &quot;In figure paintings the clothes and the appearances were not very important. The eyes were the spirit and the decisive factor.&quot;
Three of Gu&#x27;s paintings still survive today: &quot;Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies&quot;, &quot;Nymph of the Luo River&quot; (洛神賦), and &quot;Wise and Benevolent Women&quot;.

There are other examples of Jin dynasty painting from tombs. This includes the &quot;Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove,&quot; painted on a brick wall of a tomb located near modern Nanjing and now found in the Shaanxi Provincial Museum. Each of the figures are labeled and shown either drinking, writing, or playing a musical instrument. Other tomb paintings also depict scenes of daily life, such as men plowing fields with teams of oxen.

=== The Sui and Tang dynasties (581–960) ===


==== Buddhist architecture and sculpture ====
Following a transition under the Sui dynasty, Buddhist sculpture of the Tang evolved towards a markedly lifelike expression. As a consequence of the dynasty&#x27;s openness to foreign trade and influences through the Silk Road, Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Greco-Buddhist art of Central Asia.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor Wuzong outlawed all &quot;foreign&quot; religions (including Nestorian Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Buddhism) in order to support indigenous Taoism. He confiscated Buddhist possessions and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the ulterior development of the religion and its arts in China.

Glazed or painted earthenware Tang dynasty tomb figures are famous, and well-represented in museums around the world. Most wooden Tang sculptures have not survived, though representations of the Tang international style can still be seen in Nara, Japan. The longevity of stone sculpture has proved much greater. Some of the finest examples can be seen at Longmen, near Luoyang, Yungang near Datong, and Bingling Temple in Gansu.
One of the most famous Buddhist Chinese pagodas is the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, built in 652 AD.


==== Painting ====

Beginning in the Tang dynasty (618–907), the primary subject matter of painting was the landscape, known as shanshui (mountain water) painting. In these landscapes, usually monochromatic and sparse, the purpose was not to reproduce exactly the appearance of nature but rather to grasp an emotion or atmosphere so as to catch the &quot;rhythm&quot; of nature.

Painting in the traditional style involved essentially the same techniques as calligraphy and was done with a brush dipped in black or colored ink; oils were not used. As with calligraphy, the most popular materials on which paintings were made were paper and silk. The finished works were then mounted on scrolls, which could be hung or rolled up. Traditional painting was also done in albums, on walls, lacquer work, and in other media.

Dong Yuan was an active painter in the Southern Tang Kingdom. He was known for both figure and landscape paintings, and exemplified the elegant style which would become the standard for brush painting in China over the next 900 years. As with many artists in China, his profession was as an official where he studied the existing styles of Li Sixun and Wang Wei. However, he added to the number of techniques, including more sophisticated perspective, use of pointillism and crosshatching to build up vivid effect.

Zhan Ziqian was a painter during the Sui dynasty. His only painting in existence is &quot;Strolling About In Spring&quot; arranged mountains perspectively. Because pure landscape paintings are hardly seen in Europe until the 17th century, &quot;Strolling About In Spring&quot; may well be the world&#x27;s first landscape painting.



=== The Song and Yuan dynasties (960–1368) ===


==== Song painting ====
During the Song dynasty (960–1279), landscapes of more subtle expression appeared; immeasurable distances were conveyed through the use of blurred outlines, mountain contours disappearing into the mist, and impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. Emphasis was placed on the spiritual qualities of the painting and on the ability of the artist to reveal the inner harmony of man and nature, as perceived according to Taoist and Buddhist concepts.

Liang Kai was a Chinese painter who lived in the 13th century (Song dynasty). He called himself &quot;Madman Liang&quot;, and he spent his life drinking and painting. Eventually, he retired and became a Zen monk. Liang is credited with inventing the Zen school of Chinese art. Wen Tong was a painter who lived in the 11th century. He was famous for ink paintings of bamboo. He could hold two brushes in one hand and paint two different distanced bamboos simultaneously. He did not need to see the bamboo while he painted them because he had seen a lot of them.

Zhang Zeduan was a notable painter for his horizontal &quot;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot; landscape and cityscape painting. It is considered one of China&#x27;s most renowned paintings and has had many well-known remakes throughout Chinese history. Other famous paintings include &quot;The Night Revels of Han Xizai&quot;, originally painted by the Southern Tang artist Gu Hongzhong in the 10th century, while the well-known version of his painting is a 12th-century remake of the Song dynasty. This is a large horizontal handscroll of a domestic scene showing men of the gentry class being entertained by musicians and dancers while enjoying food, beverage, and wash basins provided by maidservants. In 2000, the modern artist Wang Qingsong created a parody of this painting with a long, horizontal photograph of people in modern clothing making similar facial expressions, poses, and hand gestures as the original painting.





==== Yuan painting ====
With the fall of the Song dynasty in 1279, and the subsequent dislocation caused by the establishment of the Yuan dynasty by the Mongol conquerors, many court and literary artists retreated from social life, and returned to nature, through landscape paintings, and by renewing the &quot;blue and green&quot; style of the Tang era.

Wang Meng was one such painter, and one of his most famous works is the &quot;Forest Grotto&quot;. Zhao Mengfu was a Chinese scholar, painter and calligrapher during the Yuan dynasty. His rejection of the refined, gentle brushwork of his era in favor of the cruder style of the 8th century is considered to have brought about a revolution that created the modern Chinese landscape painting. There was also the vivid and detailed works of art by Qian Xuan (1235–1305), who had served the Song court, and out of patriotism refused to serve the Mongols, instead turning to painting. He was also famous for reviving and reproducing a more Tang dynasty style of painting.

The later Yuan dynasty is characterized by the work of the so-called &quot;Four Great Masters&quot;. The most notable of these was Huang Gongwang (1269–1354) whose cool and restrained landscapes were admired by contemporaries, and by the Chinese literati painters of later centuries. Another of great influence was Ni Zan (1301–1374), who frequently arranged his compositions with a strong and distinct foreground and background, but left the middle-ground as an empty expanse. This scheme was frequently to be adopted by later Ming and Qing dynasty painters.

====Pottery====
Chinese porcelain is made from a hard paste made of the clay kaolin and a feldspar called petuntse, which cements the vessel and seals any . &quot;China&quot; has become synonymous with high-quality porcelain. Most china pots comes from the city of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province. Jingdezhen porcelain, under a variety of names, has been central to porcelain production in China since at least the Yuan dynasty.

===Late imperial China (1368–1912)===

==== Ming painting ====

Under the Ming dynasty, Chinese culture bloomed. Narrative painting, with a wider color range and a much busier composition than the Song paintings, was immensely popular during the time.

Wen Zhengming (1470–1559) developed the style of the Wu school in Suzhou, which dominated Chinese painting during the 16th century.

Dong Qichang (1555–1636) further influenced East Asian art history by absorbing Chan Buddhism ideas and putting forward the &quot;Southern and Northern Schools&quot; theory.

European culture began to make an impact on Chinese art during this period. The Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci visited Nanjing with many Western artworks, which were influential in showing different techniques of perspective and shading.

==== Early Qing painting ====
The early Qing dynasty developed in two main strands: the Orthodox school, and the Individualist painters, both of which followed the theories of Dong Qichang, but emphasizing very different aspects. Court painting of the Qing dynasty was also greatly influenced by Western artists such as Jean Denis Attiret (1702–1768) and Giuseppe Castiglione (1688–1766).

The &quot;Four Wangs&quot;, including Wang Jian (1598–1677) and Wang Shimin (1592–1680), were particularly renowned in the Orthodox school, and sought inspiration in recreating the past styles, especially the technical skills in brushstrokes and calligraphy of ancient masters. The younger Wang Yuanqi (1642–1715) ritualized the approach of engaging with and drawing inspiration from a work of an ancient master. His own works were often annotated with his theories of how his painting relates to the master&#x27;s model.

The Individualist painters included Bada Shanren (1626–1705) and Shitao (1641–1707). They drew more from the revolutionary ideas of transcending the tradition to achieve an original individualistic styles; in this way they were more faithfully following the way of Dong Qichang than the Orthodox school (who were his official direct followers.)

Painters outside of the literati-scholar and aristocratic traditions also gained renown, with some artists creating paintings to sell for money. These included Ma Quan (late 17th–18th century), who depicted common flowers, birds, and insects that were not typical subject matter among scholars. Such painters were, however, not separated from formal schools of painting, but were usually well-versed in artistic styles and techniques. Ma Quan, for example, modelled her brushwork on Song dynasty examples. Simultaneously, the boneless technique (), thought to have originated as a preparatory step when painting gold-line images during the Tang, was continued by painters like Yun Shouping (1633–1690) and his descendant Yun Bing.

As the techniques of color printing were perfected, illustrated manuals on the art of painting began to be published. &quot;Jieziyuan Huazhuan&quot; (Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden), a five-volume work first published in 1679, has been in use as a technical textbook for artists and students ever since.

==== Late Qing art ====
Nianhua were a form of colored woodblock prints in China, depicting images for decoration during the Chinese New Year. In the 19th century Nianhua were used as news mediums.

==== Shanghai School ====
The Shanghai School is a very important Chinese school of traditional arts during the Qing dynasty and the 20th century. Under efforts of masters from this school, traditional Chinese art reached another climax and continued to the present in forms of Chinese painting (中國畫), or &quot;guohua&quot; (國畫) for short. The Shanghai School challenged and broke the literati tradition of Chinese art, while also paying technical homage to the ancient masters and improving on existing traditional techniques. Members of this school were themselves educated literati who had come to question their very status and the purpose of art, and had anticipated the impending modernization of Chinese society. In an era of rapid social change, works from the Shanghai School were widely innovative and diverse, and often contained thoughtful yet subtle social commentary. The best known figures from this school are Ren Xiong, Ren Bonian, Zhao Zhiqian, Wu Changshuo, Sha Menghai, Pan Tianshou, Fu Baoshi, He Tianjian, and Xie Zhiliu. Other well-known painters include Wang Zhen, Xugu, Zhang Xiong, Hu Yuan, and Yang Borun.

== Painting ==

Traditional Chinese painting, like Chinese calligraphy, is done with a
brush dipped in black or colored ink; oils are not used. As with calligraphy, the most popular materials on which paintings are made of are paper and silk. The finished work can be mounted on scrolls, such as hanging scrolls or handscrolls. Traditional painting can also be done on album sheets, walls, lacquerware, folding screens, and other media.

The two main techniques in Chinese painting are:
* Gong-bi (工筆), meaning &quot;meticulous&quot;, uses highly detailed brushstrokes that delimits details very precisely. It is often highly coloured and usually depicts figural or narrative subjects. It is often practised by artists working for the royal court or in independent workshops. Bird-and-flower paintings were often in this style.
* Ink and wash painting, in Chinese &quot;Shui-mo&quot; or (水墨) also loosely termed watercolour or brush painting, and also known as &quot;literati painting&quot;, as it was one of the &quot;four arts&quot; of the Chinese Scholar-official class. In theory this was an art practised by gentlemen, a distinction that begins to be made in writings on art from the Song dynasty, though in fact the careers of leading exponents could benefit considerably. This style is also referred to as &quot;xie yi&quot; (寫意) or freehand style.

Artists from the Han to the Tang dynasties mainly painted the human figure. Much of what is known of early Chinese figure painting comes from burial sites, where paintings were preserved on silk banners, lacquered objects, and tomb walls. Many early tomb paintings were meant to protect the dead or help their souls get to paradise. Others illustrated the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius, or showed scenes of daily life. Most Chinese portraits showed a formal full-length frontal view, and were used in the family in ancestor veneration. Imperial portraits were more flexible, but were generally not seen outside the court, and portraiture formed no part of Imperial propaganda, as in other cultures.

Many critics consider landscape to be the highest form of Chinese painting. The time from the Five Dynasties period to the Northern Song period (907–1127) is known as the &quot;Great age of Chinese landscape&quot;. In the north, artists such as Jing Hao, Li Cheng, Fan Kuan, and Guo Xi painted pictures of towering mountains, using strong black lines, ink wash, and sharp, dotted brushstrokes to suggest rough rocks. In the south, Dong Yuan, Juran, and other artists painted the rolling hills and rivers of their native countryside in peaceful scenes done with softer, rubbed brushwork. These two kinds of scenes and techniques became the classical styles of Chinese landscape painting.

==Sculpture==
Chinese ritual bronzes from the Shang and Western Zhou dynasties come from a period of over a thousand years from c. 1500 BC, and have exerted a continuing influence over Chinese art. They are cast with complex patterned and zoomorphic decoration, but avoid the human figure, unlike the huge figures only recently discovered at Sanxingdui. The spectacular Terracotta Army was assembled for the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of a unified China from 221 to 210 BC, as a grand imperial version of the figures long placed in tombs to enable the deceased to enjoy the same lifestyle in the afterlife as when alive, replacing actual sacrifices of very early periods. Smaller figures in pottery or wood were placed in tombs for many centuries afterwards, reaching a peak of quality in the Tang dynasty tomb figures.

Native Chinese religions do not usually use cult images of deities, or even represent them, and large religious sculpture is nearly all Buddhist, dating mostly from the 4th to the 14th century, and initially using Greco-Buddhist models arriving via the Silk Road. Buddhism is also the context of all large portrait sculpture; in total contrast to some other areas in medieval China even painted images of the emperor were regarded as private. Imperial tombs have spectacular avenues of approach lined with real and mythological animals on a scale matching Egypt, and smaller versions decorate temples and palaces. Small Buddhist figures and groups were produced to a very high quality in a range of media, as was relief decoration of all sorts of objects, especially in metalwork and jade. Sculptors of all sorts were regarded as artisans and very few names are recorded.

==Ceramics==
Chinese ceramic ware shows a continuous development since the pre-dynastic periods, and is one of the most significant forms of Chinese art. China is richly endowed with the raw materials needed for making ceramics. The first types of ceramics were made during the Palaeolithic era, and in later periods range from construction materials such as bricks and tiles, to hand-built pottery vessels fired in bonfires or kilns, to the sophisticated Chinese porcelain wares made for the imperial court. Most later Chinese ceramics, even of the finest quality, were made on an industrial scale, thus very few individual potters or painters are known. Many of the most renowned workshops were owned by or reserved for the Emperor, and large quantities of ceramics were exported as diplomatic gifts or for trade from an early date.

==Decorative arts==
As well as porcelain, a wide range of materials that were more valuable were worked and decorated with great skill for a range of uses or just for display. Chinese jade was attributed with magical powers, and was used in the Stone and Bronze Ages for large and impractical versions of everyday weapons and tools, as well as the &quot;bi&quot; disks and &quot;cong&quot; vessels. Later a range of objects and small sculptures were carved in jade, a difficult and time-consuming technique. Bronze, gold and silver, rhinoceros horn, Chinese silk, ivory, lacquer and carved lacquer, cloisonne enamel and many other materials had specialist artists working in them. Cloisonne underwent an interesting process of artistic hybridization in China, particularly in the pieces promoted by missionaries and Chinese Christian communities.

Folding screens () are often decorated with beautiful art; major themes include mythology, scenes of palace life, and nature. Materials such as wood panel, paper and silk are used in making folding screens. They were considered ideal ornaments for many painters to display their paintings and calligraphy. Many artists painted on paper or silk and applied it onto the folding screen. There were two distinct artistic folding screens mentioned in historical literature of the era.

==Architecture==

Chinese architecture refers to a style of architecture that has taken shape in East Asia over many centuries. Especially Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Ryukyu. The structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Since the Tang dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Korea, Vietnam, and Japan.

From the Neolithic era Longshan culture and Bronze Age era Erlitou culture, the earliest rammed earth fortifications exist, with evidence of timber architecture. The subterranean ruins of the palace at Yinxu dates back to the Shang. In historic China, architectural emphasis was laid upon the horizontal axis, in particular the construction of a heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not as well emphasized. This contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings. The deviation from this standard is the tower architecture of the Chinese tradition, which began as a native tradition and was eventually influenced by the Buddhist building for housing religious sutras—the stupa—which came from Nepal. Ancient Chinese tomb model representations of multiple story residential towers and watchtowers date to the Han. However, the earliest extant Buddhist Chinese pagoda is the Songyue Pagoda, a 40 m (131 ft) tall circular-based brick tower built in Henan in the year 523 CE From the 6th century onwards, stone-based structures become more common, while the earliest are from stone and brick arches found in Han dynasty tombs. The Zhaozhou Bridge built from 595 to 605 CEis China&#x27;s oldest extant stone bridge, as well as the world&#x27;s oldest fully stone open-spandrel segmental arch bridge.
The vocational trade of architect, craftsman, and engineer was not as highly respected in premodern Chinese society as the scholar-bureaucrats who were drafted into the government by the civil service examination system. Much of the knowledge about early Chinese architecture was passed on from one tradesman to his son or associative apprentice. However, there were several early treatises on architecture in China, with encyclopedic information on architecture dating back to the Han dynasty. The height of the classical Chinese architectural tradition in writing and illustration can be found in the &quot;Yingzao Fashi&quot;, a building manual written by 1100 and published by Li Jie (1065–1110) in 1103. In it there are numerous and meticulous illustrations and diagrams showing the assembly of halls and building components, as well as classifying structure types and building components.

There were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the Emperor of China. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles; yellow having been the Imperial color, yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the Forbidden City. The Temple of Heaven, however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by brackets, a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surface of the walls, tend to be red in colour.

Many current Chinese architectural designs follow post-modern and western styles.

== Chinoiserie ==

Chinoiserie is the European interpretation and imitation of Chinese and East Asian artistic traditions, especially in the decorative arts, garden design, architecture, literature, theatre, and music. The aesthetic of Chinoiserie has been expressed in different ways depending on the region. It is related to the broader current of Orientalism, which studied Far East cultures from a historical, philological, anthropological, philosophical, and religious point of view. First appearing in the 17th century, this trend was popularized in the 18th century due to the rise in trade with China and East Asia.

As a style, chinoiserie is related to the rococo style. Both styles are characterized by exuberant decoration, asymmetry, a focus on materials, and stylized nature and subject matter that focuses on leisure and pleasure. Chinoiserie focuses on subjects that were thought by colonial-era Europeans to be typical of Chinese culture.

==Modern Chinese art==
=== New China art (1912–1949) ===
====Modern art movement ====

The movement to modernize Chinese art started toward the end of the Qing dynasty. The traditional art form started to lose its appeal as the feudalistic structure of the society was dissolving. The modern view of the world had to be expressed in a different form. The explorations went on two main paths: one was to draw from the past to enrich the present ()*, the other was to &quot;learn the new methods&quot; ().*

===== Draw from the past =====

The literati art for the social elite was not appealing to the bourgeois patrons. Wu Changshuo (1844–1927) was among the Shanghai-based artists responsible for flowers and plants as the subject matter. His paintings used bold colors and energetic brush strokes, making them more accessible to the general public. Qi Baishi (1864–1957) painted images like crabs and shrimps that were even more approachable to the common people. Huang Binhong (1865–1955) denounced the literati paintings of the Qing dynasty and created his own style of landscape paintings by extensive investigations in Chinese art history. Zhang Daqian (1899–1983) used wall paintings in the Dunhuang () caves to help him move beyond the literati tradition.

===== Learn new methods =====

The Lingnan School () made some borrowings from the language of Western art in their ink paintings. Gao Jianfu (1879–1951), one of the founders of Lingnan School, was an active participant in the revolutionary movement of Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925). He was innovative in that he intended to use his paintings to highlight national issues, a medium for positive change in society.
A more radical style change started with Kang Youwei (1858–1927), a reformer who admired the more reality-based art of the Song dynasty. He believed that Chinese art could be rejuvenated by employing the reality-oriented art techniques of Europe. Xu Beihong (1895–1953) took this idea to heart and went to Paris to acquire the necessary skills. Liu Haisu (1896–1994), on the other hand, went to Japan to learn western techniques. Both Xu, and Liu became presidents of prestigious art schools, instilling new concepts and skills in the next generation of artists. Cai Yuanpei (1868–1940) was one of the leaders in the &quot;New Culture Movement&quot; (). Those involved believed that intellectual activities should benefit all, not just the elites. Cai&#x27;s belief that art could play a public, socially reformist role was adopted by Lin Fengmian (1900–1991).

Together with Yan Wenliang (1893–1988), Xu, Liu, and Lin were considered the &quot;Four Great Academy Presidents&quot; (), who spearheaded the national modern art movement. However, the subsequent upheaval caused by the Sino–Japanese war and the civil war did not allow this movement to grow. The Chinese modern art movement after the war developed differently in the four the regions: the Mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and overseas.

=== Postwar Chinese art (1949–1976) ===
The postwar era is roughly from 1949, the end of Chinese civil war, to 1976, the opening of mainland China to the outside world.

==== Mainland ====
The postwar era in mainland China could be divided into two periods: 1949 to 1966 is generally called &quot;The 17 Years&quot;; 1966 to 1976 is the period of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;.

===== The 17 Years =====
Chinese artists adopted social realism as a form of expression; it was a combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Artwork was not valued on its own terms but was subservient to a political purpose. According to Mao Zedong, art should be a &quot;powerful weapon for uniting and educating the people, fighting and destroying the enemy&quot;. Praising political leaders and celebrating the achievements of socialism became the theme of all artwork. Western art forms, including Cubism, Fauvism, Abstraction, and Expressionism were deemed superficial and were categorized as formalism.

The biggest blow to art was the Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957. Artists who were labeled as rightists were stripped of their right to create and even their jobs, and worse, the social standing of the artists and their families was placed at the lowest level, causing great mental suffering.

Some influential paintings from this period are:
* Li Keran, &quot;Reddening of Ten Thousand Mountains&quot; ()
* Huang Zhou, &quot;The Snowstorm&quot; ()
* Dong Xiwen, &quot;The Founding Ceremony of the Nation&quot; (董希文《开国大典》) had gone through several revisions, due to the changing political situation. Gao Gang was taken out when he went out of favor, Liu Shaoqi was replaced by Dong Biwu for a while, then the prototype was restored.

===== Cultural Revolution =====
These ten years could also be called the &quot;Ten Years of Calamity&quot; (). In order to destroy everything that supported the old social order, countless temples, historic sites, artworks, and books were ravaged and burnt. During this period the portrait of Mao and propaganda posters of revolution were everywhere. Anything that was remotely suspected of being out of line was destroyed, and the person behind it was prosecuted. For example, &quot;Owl&quot; by Huang Yongyu had one eye open and one eye closed; it was deemed an expression of dissatisfaction with current events. Zong Qixiang&#x27;s painting, which shows three tigers, was deemed critical of the leader Lin Biao, whose name contained a character that had three tigers in it. &quot;Residual Lotus&quot; by Li Kuchan had eight lotus flowers; it was deemed to be critical of the eight communist approved movies (). Many prominent artists were persecuted during this time. For example, Yan, Xu, Liu, and Lin, the &quot;Four Great Academy Presidents&quot; 四大校長 (except for Xu who died before the Cultural Revolution), were all prosecuted and jailed, and all their work was destroyed during this time.
However, despite the difficult environment, some noteworthy paintings were created. The following are some examples:
* Chen Yifei, &quot;The Yellow River&quot; ()
* Sun Jingbo, &quot;New Song by Ah Xi&quot; ()

==== Hong Kong ====
Hong Kong was a British colony from 1842 to 1997. The local art organizations were mostly run by Westerners who outnumbered Chinese painters until a large migration of Chinese from Southern China during Sino–Japanese War. Innovative art colleges were established after the war. The shows organized by local artists started in the early 1960s. After a reaction against the traditional Western artistic practices of the 1940s and the 1950s, some experimental works that combined both western and eastern techniques were made. Then came the call for a return to Chinese traditional art and the creation of forms of art that Hong Kong could call its own. The trend was led by Lui Shou Kwan. Some western concepts were incorporated into his Chinese ink paintings.
* Lui Shou Kwan, 1965

==== Overseas ====

===== Paris =====
Many Chinese artists went to study western art in Paris in the early 1900s, for example: Fang Ganmin (方幹民), Wu Dayu (吳大羽), Ong Schan Tchow (翁占秋), Lin Fengmian (林風眠), Yan Wenliang (顏文樑), Wu Guanzhong (吳冠中), Zao Wou-Ki (趟無極). All except Zao completed their education before 1949 and returned to become leaders in the modern art movement. (Zao happened to be in Paris in 1949 and did not return.) Some Chinese artists went to stay there because of the rich international art environment, for example: Sanyu, Pan Yuliang (潘玉良), Chu Teh-Chun (朱德群). Zao, Sanyu, Pang, and Chu all had shows in Paris and the Republic. All their paintings had varying degrees of Chinese elements in them. These artists not only had a profound influence in Chinese modern art, but they also continued to engage Parisians with modern art from the East.
* Zao Wou-Ki, 1959

===== United States =====
Li Tiefu (1869–1952) was an accomplished oil painter educated in Canada and the United States. He was an active participant in the revolutionary movement of Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925).

Zeng Youhe (1925–2017) was born in Beijing. She started receiving international recognition in 1946, when Michael Sullivan began praising and writing about her work. Zeng moved to Honolulu in 1949 and visited Hong Kong and Taiwan in 1960. Like those of the Fifth Moon Group (), her paintings were abstract; but the flavor of traditional Chinese ink paintings were not as pronounced.
* Zeng Youhe, 1961

===== Taiwan =====

Because of its history, traditional Chinese art does not have strong roots in Taiwan. The art forms in Taiwan were generally decorative, until youths growing up under the Japanese occupation received formal art education in Japan. Not burdened with traditional art form, their exploration generally followed the path of &quot;learning the new methods&quot; (). When the Nationalists arrived in Taiwan, a group of ambitious youths who came with the Nationalists continued the modern art movement. The most notable were the Fifth Moon Group (五月畫會) and the Ton-Fan Art Group ().

====== Fifth Moon Group ======
The original members of the group were alumni with art majors from the Academic Teachers College (), the only university with an art major at the time. Their first intention was to show that the effort to create new art was worthwhile in itself, even if it did not directly enhance art pedagogy. Later, it became a movement to modernize Chinese art.

The members of the Fifth Moon Group studied western art movements, and concluded that the abstract art form was the best medium for modern Chinese art. They felt the best the Chinese paintings were ones that de-emphasized realistic representation, and emphasized atmosphere and &quot;vividness&quot;, which comes from the brush strokes and the natural interaction between ink and paper. To further that idea, one does not need representation of objects in painting, or strictly use ink and paper. The beauty of a painting can be appreciated directly from the forms, textures, and colors on the canvas without their relation to real objects.
The group was active from 1957 to 1972. The main members are Liu Guosong, Chuang Che (), Hu Chi-Chung (), Fong Chung-ray (), and Han Hsiang-ning.

====== Ton-Fan Art Group () ======
The members of this group were students who attended private art classes offered by Li Zhongsheng (), a mainland-born artist who had been one of the active participants in the modern art movement. He and a number of mainland artists who painted in a western style continued the modern art movement by publishing magazines and writing articles to introduce modern art to Taiwan. His teaching style was unconventional and socratic in nature.

The original intention of the group was to introduce modern art to the public. They believed there should be no restriction on the form or style of a modern Chinese painting, as long as the painting expressed meaning that was Chinese in nature. The group was active from 1957 to 1971. The main members were: Ho Kan (), Li Yuan-chia, Wu Hao (), Oyan Wen-Yuen (), Hsia Yan (), Hsiao Chin (), Tommy Chen (), and Hsiao Ming-Hsien (). The following are a sample of their paintings from that period:
*Ho Kan, 1967
*Hsia Yan, 1965
* Hsiao Chin, 1955 

===Redevelopment (mid-1980s – 1990s)===

====Contemporary art====

Contemporary Chinese art () often referred to as Chinese avant-garde art, continued to develop since the 1980s as an outgrowth of modern art developments post-Cultural Revolution.

Contemporary Chinese art fully incorporates painting, film, video, photography, and performance. Until recently, art exhibitions deemed controversial have been routinely shut down by police, and performance artists in particular faced the threat of arrest in the early 1990s. More recently there has been greater tolerance by the Chinese government, though many internationally acclaimed artists are still restricted from media exposure at home or have exhibitions ordered closed. Leading contemporary visual artists include Ai Weiwei, Cai Guoqiang, Cai Jin, Chan Shengyao, Concept 21, Ding Yi, Fang Lijun, Fu Wenjun, He Xiangyu, Huang Yan, Huang Yong Ping, Han Yajuan, Kong Bai Ji, Li Hongbo, Li Hui, Liu Bolin, Lu Shengzhong, Ma Liuming, Qiu Deshu, Qiu Shihua, Shen Fan, Shen Shaomin, Shi Jinsong, Song Dong, Li Wei, Wang Guangyi, Wenda Gu, Xu Bing, Yang Zhichao, Zhan Wang, Zheng Lianjie, Zhang Dali, Zhang Xiaogang, Zhang Huan, Zhu Yu, Wu Shaoxiang, Ma Kelu, Ding Fang, Shang Yang, Gao Minglu and Guo Jian.

====Visual art====
Beginning in the late 1980s, there was unprecedented exposure for younger Chinese visual artists in the west to some degree through the agency of curators based outside the country such as Hou Hanru. Local curators within the country such as Gao Minglu and critics such as Li Xianting reinforced this promotion of particular brands of painting that had recently emerged, while also spreading the idea of art as a strong social force within Chinese culture. There was some controversy as critics identified these imprecise representations of contemporary Chinese art as having been constructed out of personal preferences, a kind of programmatized artist-curator relationship that only further alienated the majority of the avant-garde from Chinese officialdom and western art market patronage.

==Art market==
Today, the market for Chinese art, both antique and contemporary, is widely reported to be among the hottest and fastest-growing in the world, attracting buyers all over the world. The &quot;Voice of America&quot; reported in 2006 that modern Chinese art is raking in record prices both internationally and in domestic markets, some experts even fearing the market might be overheating. &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that Chinese art has become the latest darling in the world market according to the record sales from Sotheby&#x27;s and Christie&#x27;s, the biggest fine-art auction houses.

Contemporary Chinese art saw record sales throughout the 2000s. In 2007, it was estimated that 5 of the world&#x27;s 10 best selling living artists at art auction were from China, with artists such as Zhang Xiaogang whose works were sold for a total of $56.8 million at auction in 2007. In terms of buying-market, China overtook France in the late 2000s as the world&#x27;s third-largest art market, after the United States and the United Kingdom, due to the growing middle-class in the country. Sotheby&#x27;s noted that contemporary Chinese art has rapidly changed the contemporary Asian art world into one of the most dynamic sectors on the international art market. During the global economic crisis, the contemporary Asian art market and the contemporary Chinese art market experienced a slow down in late 2008. The market for Contemporary Chinese and Asian art saw a major revival in late 2009 with record level sales at Christie&#x27;s.

For centuries largely made-up of European and American buyers, the international buying market for Chinese art has also begun to be dominated by Chinese dealers and collectors in recent years. It was reported in 2011, China has become the world&#x27;s second biggest market for art and antiques, accounting for 23 percent of the world&#x27;s total art market, behind the United States (which accounts for 34 percent of the world&#x27;s art market). Another transformation driving the growth of the Chinese art market is the rise of a clientele no longer mostly European or American. New fortunes from countries once thought of as poor often prefer non-Western art; a large gallerist in the field has offices in both New York and Beijing, but clients mainly hailing from Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.

One of the areas that has revived art concentration and also commercialized the industry is the 798 Art District in Dashanzi of Beijing. The artist Zhang Xiaogang sold a 1993 painting for US$2.3 million in 2006, which included blank faced Chinese families from the Cultural Revolution era, while Yue Minjun&#x27;s work &quot;Execution&quot; in 2007 was sold for a then record of nearly $6 million at Sotheby&#x27;s. Collectors including Stanley Ho, the owner of the Macau Casinos, investment manager Christopher Tsai, and casino developer Steve Wynn, would capitalize on the art trends. Items such as Ming dynasty vases and assorted Imperial pieces were auctioned off.

Other art works were sold in places such as Christie&#x27;s including a Chinese porcelain piece with the mark of the Qianlong Emperor sold for HKD $ $151.3 million. Sotheby&#x27;s and Christie&#x27;s act as major market platforms for classical Chinese porcelain art pieces to be sold, including Ming dynasty, Xuande mark and period (1426–35) Blue and White jar (Five-Clawed Dragon Print), which was auctioned for Approx. USD 19,224,491.2, through Christie&#x27;s in Spring 2016 The &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; reported that Chinese porcelains were fought over in the art market as &quot;if there was no tomorrow&quot;.

A 1964 painting by Li Keran &quot;All the Mountains Blanketed in Red&quot; was sold for HKD $35 million. Auctions were also held at Sotheby&#x27;s where Xu Beihong&#x27;s 1939 masterpiece &quot;Put Down Your Whip&quot; sold for HKD $72 million. The industry is not limited to fine arts, as many other types of contemporary pieces were also sold. In 2000, a number of Chinese artists were included in Documenta and the Venice Biennale of 2003. China now has its own major contemporary art showcase with the Venice Biennale. Fuck Off was a notorious art exhibition which ran alongside the Shanghai Biennial Festival in 2000 and was curated by independent curator Feng Boyi and contemporary artist Ai Weiwei.

<doc id="66299" wikidata="Q133324" url="?curid=66299" title="Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor">
<text>The Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor is an American twin-engine, all-weather, supersonic stealth fighter aircraft. As a product of the United States Air Force&#x27;s Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, the aircraft was designed as an air superiority fighter, but also incorporates ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22 airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while program partner Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems.

First flown in 1997, the F-22 descended from the Lockheed YF-22 and was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A. Although the U.S. Air Force (USAF) had originally planned to buy a total of 750 ATFs to replace its F-15 Eagles, it later scaled down to 381, and the program was ultimately cut to 195 aircraft — 187 of them operational models — in 2009 due to political opposition from high costs, a perceived lack of air-to-air threats at the time of production, and the development of the more affordable and versatile F-35. The last aircraft was delivered in 2012.

The F-22 is a critical component of the USAF&#x27;s current high-end tactical airpower. While it had a protracted development and initial operational difficulties, the aircraft became the service&#x27;s leading counter-air platform against peer adversaries. Although designed for air superiority operations, the F-22 has also performed strike and electronic surveillance, including missions in the Middle East against the Islamic State and Assad-aligned forces. The F-22 is planned to remain a cornerstone of the USAF&#x27;s fighter fleet until its succession by the crewed Next Generation Air Dominance fighter.

==Development==

===Origins===

The F-22 originated from the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program that the U.S. Air Force (USAF) initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. Intelligence reports indicated that their effectiveness would be eroded by emerging worldwide threats emanating from the Soviet Union, including new developments in surface-to-air missile systems for integrated air defense networks, the introduction of the Beriev A-50 &quot;Mainstay&quot; airborne warning and control system (AWACS), and the proliferation of the Sukhoi Su-27 &quot;Flanker&quot; and Mikoyan MiG-29 &quot;Fulcrum&quot; class of fighter aircraft. Code-named &quot;Senior Sky&quot;, the ATF would become an air superiority fighter program influenced by these threats; in the potential scenario of a Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion in Central Europe, the ATF was envisaged to support the air-land battle by spearheading offensive and defensive counter-air operations (OCA/DCA) in this highly contested environment that would then enable following echelons of NATO strike and attack aircraft to perform air interdiction against ground formations; to do so, the ATF would make an ambitious leap in capability and survivability by taking advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon, including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight control systems and avionics, more powerful propulsion systems for supersonic cruise (or supercruise) around Mach 1.5, and stealth technology for low observability.

The USAF published an ATF request for information (RFI) to the aerospace industry in May 1981, and following a period of concept and specification development, the ATF System Program Office (SPO) issued the demonstration and validation (Dem/Val) request for proposals (RFP) in September 1985, with requirements placing strong emphasis on stealth, supersonic cruise and maneuver. The RFP saw some alterations after its initial release, including more stringent signature reduction requirements in December 1985 and adding the requirement for flying technology demonstrator prototypes in May 1986. Owing to the immense investments required to develop the advanced technologies, teaming among companies was encouraged. Of the seven bidding companies, Lockheed and Northrop were selected on 31 October 1986. Lockheed, through its Skunk Works division at Burbank, California, teamed with Boeing and General Dynamics while Northrop teamed with McDonnell Douglas. These two contractor teams undertook a 50-month Dem/Val phase, culminating in the flight test of two technology demonstrator prototypes, the Lockheed YF-22 and Northrop YF-23; while they represented competing designs, the prototypes were meant for demonstrating concept viability and risk mitigation rather than a competitive flyoff. Concurrently, Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric competed for the ATF engines.
Dem/Val was focused on system engineering, technology development plans, and risk reduction over point aircraft designs; in fact, after down-select, the Lockheed team completely redesigned the airframe in the summer 1987 due to weight analysis, with notable changes including the wing planform from swept trapezoidal to diamond-like delta and a reduction in forebody planform area. The team extensively used analytical and empirical methods including computational fluid dynamics and computer-aided design, wind tunnel testing (18,000 hours for Dem/Val), and radar cross-section (RCS) calculations and pole testing. Avionics were tested in ground prototypes and flying laboratories. During Dem/Val, the SPO used trade studies from both teams to review the ATF system specifications and adjust or delete requirements that were significant weight and cost drivers while having marginal value. The short takeoff and landing (STOL) requirement was relaxed to delete thrust-reversers, saving substantial weight. Side looking radars and the dedicated infrared search and track (IRST) system were eventually removed as well, although space and cooling provisions were retained to allow for their later addition. The ejection seat was downgraded from a fresh design to the existing ACES II. Despite efforts by both teams to rein in weight, the takeoff gross weight estimates grew from , resulting in engine thrust requirement increasing from class.

Each team built two prototype air vehicles for Dem/Val, one for each of the two engine options. The YF-22 had its maiden flight on 29 September 1990 and in testing successfully demonstrated supercruise, high angle-of-attack maneuvers, and the firing of air-to-air missiles from internal weapons bays. After the flight test of the demonstrator prototypes at Edwards Air Force Base, the teams submitted the results and their full-scale development design proposals — or Preferred System Concept — in December 1990; on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the USAF Donald Rice announced the Lockheed team and Pratt &amp; Whitney as the winners of the ATF and engine competitions. Both designs met or exceeded all performance requirements; the YF-23 was considered stealthier and faster, but the YF-22, with its thrust vectoring nozzles, was more maneuverable as well as less expensive and risky, having flown considerably more test sorties and hours than its counterpart. The press also speculated that the Lockheed team&#x27;s design was more adaptable to the Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF) for replacing the F-14 Tomcat, but by fiscal year (FY) 1992, the U.S. Navy had abandoned NATF due to cost.

===Full-scale development===
The program formally moved to full-scale development, or Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD), in August 1991. The production F-22 design (internally designated Configuration 645) had also evolved to have notable differences from the YF-22, which was immature due to being frozen relatively soon after the complete redesign in summer 1987. While the configuration was similar, the external geometry saw significant alterations; the wing&#x27;s leading edge sweep angle was decreased from 48° to 42°, while the vertical stabilizers were shifted rearward and decreased in area by 20%. The radome shape was changed for better radar performance, the wingtips were clipped for antennas, and the dedicated airbrake was eliminated. To improve pilot visibility and aerodynamics, the canopy was moved forward and the engine inlets moved rearward . The shapes of the fuselage, wing, and stabilator trailing edges were refined to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics. The internal structural design was refined and reinforced, with the production airframe designed for a service life of 8,000 hours. The revised shaping was validated with over 17,000 additional hours of wind tunnel testing and further RCS testing at Helendale, California and the USAF RATSCAT range before first flight. Increasing weight during EMD due to demanding ballistic survivability requirements and added capabilities caused slight reductions in projected range and maneuver performance.
Aside from advances in air vehicle and propulsion technology, the F-22&#x27;s avionics were unprecedented in complexity and scale for a combat aircraft, with the fusion of multiple sensors systems and antennas, including electronic warfare, communication/navigation/identification (CNI), and software integration of 1.7 million lines of code written in Ada; the avionics often became the pacing factor of the whole program. In light of rapidly advancing computing and semiconductor technology, the avionics was to employ the Department of Defense&#x27;s (DoD) &quot;PAVE PILLAR&quot; systems architecture and Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) program technology; the avionics had computing and processing requirements equivalent to multiple contemporary Cray supercomputers in order to achieve sensor fusion. To enable early looks and troubleshooting for mission software development, the software was ground-tested in Boeing&#x27;s Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL) and flight-tested on a Boeing 757 modified with F-22 mission systems, called Flying Test Bed. Because much of the F-22&#x27;s avionics design occurred in the 1990s as the electronics industry was shifting from military to commercial applications as the predominant market, avionics upgrade efforts was initially difficult and protracted due to changing industry standards; for instance, C/C++ rather than Ada became predominant programming languages.
The roughly equal division of work amongst the team largely carried through from Dem/Val to EMD, with prime contractor Lockheed responsible for the forward fuselage and control surfaces, General Dynamics for the center fuselage, and Boeing for aft fuselage and wings. Lockheed acquired General Dynamics&#x27; fighter portfolio at Fort Worth, Texas in 1993 and thus had the majority of the airframe manufacturing, and merged with Martin Marietta in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin. While Lockheed primarily performed Dem/Val work at its Skunk Works sites in Burbank and Palmdale, California, it shifted its program office and EMD work from Burbank to Marietta, Georgia, where it performed final assembly; Boeing manufactured airframe components, performed avionics integration and developed the training systems in Seattle, Washington. The EMD contract originally ordered seven single-seat F-22As and two twin-seat F-22Bs, although the latter was canceled in 1996 to reduce development costs and the orders were converted to single seaters. The first F-22A, an EMD aircraft with tail number 91-4001, was unveiled at Air Force Plant 6 in Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta on 9 April 1997 where it was officially named &quot;Raptor&quot;. The aircraft first flew on 7 September 1997, piloted by chief test pilot Alfred &quot;Paul&quot; Metz. The Raptor&#x27;s designation was briefly changed to F/A-22 starting in September 2002, mimicking the Navy&#x27;s F/A-18 Hornet and intended to highlight a planned ground-attack capability amid debate over the aircraft&#x27;s role and relevance. The F-22 designation was reinstated in December 2005, when the aircraft entered service.
The F-22 flight test program consisted of flight sciences, developmental test (DT), and initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) by the 411th Flight Test Squadron (FLTS) at Edwards AFB, California, as well as follow-on OT&amp;E and development of tactics and operational employment by the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) at Nellis AFB, Nevada. Nine EMD jets assigned to the 411th FLTS would participate in the test program under the Combined Test Force (CTF) at Edwards. The first two aircraft conducted envelope expansion testing such as flying qualities, air vehicle performance, propulsion, and stores separation. The third aircraft, the first to have production-level internal structure, tested flight loads, flutter, and stores separation, while two non-flying F-22s were built for testing static loads and fatigue. Subsequent EMD aircraft and the Boeing 757 FTB tested avionics, environmental qualifications, and observables, with the first combat-capable Block 3.0 software flying in 2001. Air vehicle testing resulted in several structural design modifications and retrofits for earlier lots, including tail fin strengthening to resolve buffeting in certain conditions. Raptor 4001 was retired from flight testing in 2000 and subsequently sent to Wright-Patterson AFB for survivability testing, including live fire testing and battle damage repair training. Other retired EMD F-22s have been used as maintenance trainers.
Because the F-22 had been designed to defeat contemporary and projected Soviet fighters, the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 had major impacts on program funding; the DoD reduced its urgency for new weapon systems and the following years would see successive reductions in its budget. This resulted in the F-22&#x27;s EMD being rescheduled and lengthened multiple times. Furthermore, the aircraft&#x27;s sophistication and numerous technological innovations required extensive testing, which exacerbated the cost overruns and delays, particularly from mission avionics. Some capabilities were also deferred to post-service upgrades, reducing the upfront cost but increasing total program cost. The program transitioned to full-rate production in March 2005 and completed EMD that December, after which the test force had flown 3,496 sorties for over 7,600 flight hours. As the F-22 was designed for upgrades throughout its lifecycle, the 411th FLTS and 422nd TES continued the DT/OT&amp;E and tactics development of these upgrades. Derivatives such as the X-44 thrust vectoring research aircraft and the FB-22 medium-range regional bomber were proposed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, although these were eventually abandoned. In 2006, the F-22 development team won the Collier Trophy, American aviation&#x27;s most prestigious award. Due to the aircraft&#x27;s sophisticated capabilities, contractors have been targeted by cyberattacks and technology theft.

===Production and procurement===
The USAF originally envisioned ordering 750 ATFs at a total program cost of $44.3 billion and procurement cost of $26.2 billion in FY 1985 dollars, with production beginning in 1994 and service entry in the mid-to-late 1990s. The 1990 Major Aircraft Review (MAR) led by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced this to 648 aircraft beginning in 1996 and service entry in the early-to-mid 2000s. After the end of the Cold War, this was further curtailed to 442 in the 1993 Bottom-Up Review while the USAF eventually set its requirement to 381 to support its Air Expeditionary Force structure with the last deliveries in 2013. Throughout development and production, the program was continually scrutinized for its costs and less expensive alternatives such as modernized F-15 or F-16 variants were being proposed, even though the USAF considered the F-22 to provide the greatest capability increase against peer adversaries for the investment. However, funding instability had reduced the total to 339 by 1997 and production was nearly halted by Congress in 1999. Although funds were eventually restored, the planned number continued to decline due to delays and cost overruns during EMD, slipping to 277 by 2003. In 2004, with its focus on asymmetric counterinsurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan, the DoD under Secretary Donald Rumsfeld further cut procurement to 183 production aircraft, despite the USAF&#x27;s requirement for 381; funding for this number was reached by a multi-year procurement contract awarded in 2006, with aircraft distributed to seven combat squadrons; total program cost was projected to be $62 billion (~$ in ). In 2008, the Congressional defense spending bill raised the number to 187.

F-22 production would support over 1,000 subcontractors and suppliers from 46 states and up to 95,000 jobs, and spanned 15 years at a peak rate of roughly two airplanes per month, about half of the initially planned rate from the 1990 MAR; after EMD aircraft contracts, the first production lot was awarded in September 2000. As production wound down in 2011, the total program cost was estimated to be about $67.3 billion (about $360 million for each production aircraft delivered), with $32.4 billion spent on Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and $34.9 billion on procurement and military construction in then year dollars. The incremental cost for an additional F-22 was estimated at $138 million (~$ in ) in 2009.

In total, 195 F-22s were built. The first two were EMD aircraft in the Block 1.0 configuration for initial flight testing and envelope expansion, while the third was a Block 2.0 aircraft built to represent the internal structure of production airframes and enabled it to test full flight loads. Six more EMD aircraft were built in the Block 10 configuration for development and upgrade testing, with the last two considered essentially production-quality jets. Production for operational squadrons consisted of 74 Block 10/20 training aircraft and 112 Block 30/35 combat aircraft for a total of 186 (or 187 when accounting for Production Representative Test Vehicles and certain EMD jets); one of the Block 30 aircraft is dedicated to flight sciences at Edwards AFB. By 2020, Block 20 aircraft from Lot 3 onward were upgraded to Block 30 standards under the Common Configuration Plan, increasing the Block 30/35 fleet to 149 aircraft while 37 remained in the Block 20 configuration for training.

===Ban on exports===
In order to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of the aircraft&#x27;s stealth technology and classified capabilities to U.S. adversaries, annual DoD appropriations acts since FY1998 have included a provision prohibiting the use of funds made available in each act to approve or license the sale of the F-22 to any foreign government. Customers for U.S. fighters are acquiring earlier designs such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon or the newer F-35 Lightning II, which contains technology from the F-22 but was designed to be cheaper, more flexible, and available for export. In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales. Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report on the effect of export sales on the U.S. aerospace industry.

Some Australian defense officials and politicians have expressed interest in procuring the F-22; in 2008, the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, stated that the aircraft was being considered by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a potential supplement to the F-35. Some defense commentators have even advocated for the purchase in lieu of the planned F-35s, citing the F-22&#x27;s known capabilities and F-35&#x27;s delays and developmental uncertainties. However, considerations for the F-22 were later dropped and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet would serve as the RAAF&#x27;s interim aircraft prior to the F-35&#x27;s service entry.

The Japanese government also showed interest in the F-22. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) would reportedly require fewer fighters for its mission if it obtained the F-22, thus reducing engineering and staffing costs. With the end of F-22 production, Japan chose the F-35 in December 2011. At one point the Israeli Air Force had hoped to purchase up to 50 F-22s. In November 2003, however, Israeli
representatives announced that after years of analysis and discussions with Lockheed Martin and the DoD, they had concluded that Israel could not afford the aircraft. Israel eventually purchased the F-35.

===Production termination===
Throughout the 2000s when the U.S. was primarily fighting counterinsurgency wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the USAF&#x27;s requirement for 381 F-22s was questioned over rising costs, initial reliability and availability problems, limited multirole versatility, and a lack of relevant adversaries for air combat missions. In 2006, Comptroller General of the United States David Walker found that &quot;the DoD has not demonstrated the need&quot; for more investment in the F-22, and further opposition was expressed by Bush Administration Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and his successor Robert Gates, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England, and Chairman of U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) Senators John Warner and John McCain. Under Rumsfeld, procurement was severely cut to 183 aircraft. The F-22 lost influential supporters in 2008 after the forced resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force General T. Michael Moseley. In November 2008, Gates stated that the F-22 lacked relevance in asymmetric post-Cold War conflicts, and in April 2009, under the Obama Administration, he called for production to end in FY 2011 after completing 187 F-22s.
The loss of staunch F-22 advocates in the upper DoD echelons resulted in the erosion of its political support. In July 2008, General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated to the SASC his reasons for supporting the termination of F-22 production, including shifting resources to the multi-service F-35 and the electric warfare EA-18G Growler. Although Russian and Chinese fighter developments fueled concern for the USAF, Gates dismissed this and in 2010, he set the F-22 requirement to 187 aircraft by lowering the number of major regional conflict preparations from two to one, despite an effort by Wynne&#x27;s and Moseley&#x27;s successors Michael Donley and General Norton Schwartz to raise the number to 243; according to Schwartz, he and Donley finally relented in order to convince Gates to preserve the Long Range Strike Bomber program. After President Barack Obama threatened to veto further production at Gates&#x27; urging, both the Senate and House agreed to abide by the 187 cap in July 2009. Gates highlighted the F-35&#x27;s role in the decision, and believed that the U.S. would maintain its stealth fighter numbers advantage by 2025 even with F-35 delays. In December 2011, the 195th and final F-22 was completed out of 8 test and 187 production aircraft built; the jet was delivered on 2 May 2012.

After production ended, F-22 tooling and associated documentation were retained and mothballed at the Sierra Army Depot to support repairs and maintenance throughout the fleet life cycle, as well as the possibility of a production restart or a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). The Marietta plant space was repurposed to support the C-130J and F-35, while engineering work for sustainment and upgrades continued at Fort Worth, Texas and Palmdale, California. The curtailed production forced the USAF to extend the service of 179 F-15C/Ds until 2026—well beyond its planned retirement—and replace those with new-build F-15EX, which had an active export production line that minimized non-recurring start-up costs, to maintain adequate air superiority fighter numbers.

In April 2016, Congress directed the USAF to conduct a cost study and assessment associated with resuming production of the F-22, citing advancing threats from Russia and China. On 9 June 2017, the USAF submitted their report stating they had no plans to restart the F-22 production line due to cost-prohibitive economic and logistical challenges; it estimated it would cost approximately $50 billion to procure 194 additional F-22s at a cost of $206–216 million per aircraft, including approximately $9.9 billion for non-recurring start-up costs and $40.4 billion for acquisition with the first delivery in the mid-to-late 2020s. The long gap since the end of production meant hiring new workers, sourcing replacement vendors, and finding new plant space, contributing to the high start-up costs and lead times. The USAF believed that the funding would be better invested in its next-generation Air Superiority 2030 effort, which evolved into the Next Generation Air Dominance.

===Modernization and upgrades===
The F-22 and its subsystems were designed to be upgraded over its life cycle via numbered Increments and Operational Flight Program (OFP) updates in anticipation for technological advances and evolving threats, although this initially proved difficult and costly due to the highly integrated avionics systems architecture. Amid debates over the airplane&#x27;s relevance in asymmetric counterinsurgency warfare, the first upgrades primarily focused on ground attack, or strike capabilities. Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) employment was added with Increment 2 in 2005 and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) was integrated with 3.1 in 2011; the improved AN/APG-77(V)1 radar, which incorporates air-to-ground modes, was certified in March 2007 and fitted on airframes from Lot 5 onward. To address oxygen deprivation issues, F-22s were fitted with an automatic backup oxygen system (ABOS) and modified life support system starting in 2012.
In contrast to prior upgrades, Increment 3.2 emphasized air combat capabilities with updates to electronic warfare, CNI (including Link 16 receive), and geolocation as well as AIM-9X and AIM-120D integration. Fleet releases of the two-part process began in 2013 and 2019 respectively. Concurrently, OFP updates added Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System, cryptographic enhancements, and improved avionics stability, among others. A MIDS-JTRS terminal, which includes Mode 5 IFF and Link 16 transmit/receive capability, was installed starting in 2021. To address obsolescence and modernization difficulties, the F-22&#x27;s mission computers were upgraded in 2021 with military-hardened commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) open mission system (OMS) processor modules with a modular open systems architecture (MOSA). Agile software development process in conjunction with an orchestration system was implemented to enable faster upgrades from additional vendors, and software updates shifted away from Increments developed using the waterfall model to numbered annual releases.

Additional upgrades currently being tested include new sensors and antennas, integration of new weapons including the AIM-260 JATM, and reliability improvements such as more durable stealth coatings; the dedicated infrared search and track (IRST), originally deleted during Dem/Val, is one of the sensors added. Other developments include all-aspect IRST functionality for the Missile Launch Detector (MLD), manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) capability with uncrewed collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) or &quot;loyal wingmen&quot;, and cockpit improvements. To preserve the aircraft&#x27;s stealth while enabling additional payload and fuel capacity, stealthy external carriage has been investigated since the early-2000s, with a low drag, low-observable external tank and pylon currently under development to increase stealthy combat radius. The F-22 has also been used to test technology for its eventual successor from the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program; some advances are to be applied to the F-22 as well.

Not all proposed upgrades have been implemented. The planned Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) integration was cut due to development delays and lack of proliferation. Although the Gentex/Raytheon (now Thales USA) Scorpion helmet-mounted cuing system (HMCS) was successfully tested on the F-22 in 2013, funding cuts prevented its deployment. While Block 20 aircraft from Lot 3 onwards have been upgraded to Block 30/35 under the Common Configuration Plan, Lockheed Martin in 2017 had also proposed upgrading all remaining Block 20 training aircraft to Block 30/35 as well to increase numbers available for combat; this was not pursued due to other budget priorities.

Aside from modernizations, the F-22&#x27;s structural design and construction was improved over the course of the production run; for instance, aircraft from Lot 3 onwards had improved stabilators built by Vought. The fleet underwent a $350 million &quot;structures repair/retrofit program&quot; (SRP) to resolve problems identified during testing as well as address improper titanium heat treatment in the parts of early batches. By January 2021, all aircraft had gone through the SRP to ensure full service lives for the entire fleet. The F-22 has also been used to test and qualify alternative fuels, including a synthetic jet fuel consisting of 50/50 mix of JP-8 and a Fischer–Tropsch process-produced, natural gas-based fuel in August 2008, and a 50% mixture of biofuel derived from camelina in March 2011.

==Design==
===Overview===
The F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation air superiority fighter that is considered fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and integrated avionics (or sensor fusion) in a single weapons platform to enable it to survive and conduct missions, primarily offensive and defensive counter-air operations, in highly contested environments.

The F-22&#x27;s shape combines stealth and aerodynamic performance. Planform and panel edges are aligned at common angular aspects and the surfaces, also aligned accordingly, have continuous curvature to minimize the aircraft&#x27;s radar cross-section. Its clipped diamond-like delta wings have the leading edge swept 42°, trailing edge swept −17°, a slight anhedral and a conical camber to reduce supersonic wave drag. The shoulder-mounted wings are smoothly blended into the fuselage with four empennage surfaces and leading edge root extensions running to the caret inlets&#x27; upper edges, where the forebody chines also meet. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails (stabilators); for air braking, the ailerons deflect up, flaperons down, and rudders outwards to increase drag. Owing to the focus on supersonic performance, area rule is applied extensively to the airplane&#x27;s shape and nearly all of the fuselage volume lies ahead of the wing&#x27;s trailing edge to reduce drag at supersonic speeds, with the stabilators pivoting from tail booms extending aft of the engine nozzles. Weapons are carried internally in the fuselage for stealth. The jet has a retractable tricycle landing gear and an emergency tailhook. Fire suppression system and fuel tank inerting system are installed for survivability.

The aircraft&#x27;s dual Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 augmented turbofan engines are closely spaced and incorporate rectangular two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzles with a range of ±20 degrees in the pitch-axis; the nozzles are fully integrated into the F-22&#x27;s flight controls and vehicle management system. Each engine has dual-redundant Hamilton Standard full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) and maximum thrust in the 35,000 lbf (156 kN) class. The F-22&#x27;s thrust-to-weight ratio at typical combat weight is nearly at unity in maximum military power and 1.25 in full afterburner. The fixed shoulder-mounted caret inlets are offset from the forward fuselage to divert the turbulent boundary layer and generate oblique shocks with the upper inboard corners to ensure good total pressure recovery and efficient supersonic flow compression. Maximum speed without external stores is approximately Mach 1.8 in supercruise at military/intermediate power and greater than Mach 2 with afterburners. With of internal fuel and an additional in two 600-gallon external tanks, the jet has a ferry range of over . The aircraft has a refueling boom receptacle centered on its spine and an auxiliary power unit embedded in the left wing root.
The F-22&#x27;s high cruise speed and operating altitude over prior fighters improve the effectiveness of its sensors and weapon systems, and increase survivability against ground defenses such as surface-to-air missiles. Its ability to supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using afterburners, allows it to intercept targets that afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters due to a lack of parasitic drag from external stores. The F-22&#x27;s thrust and aerodynamics enable regular combat speeds of Mach 1.5 at , thus providing 50% greater employment range for air-to-air missiles and twice the effective range for JDAMs than with prior platforms. Its structure contains a significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, titanium alloys and bismaleimide/epoxy composites comprise 42% and 24% of the structural weight; the materials and multiple load path structural design also enable good ballistic survivability.

The airplane&#x27;s aerodynamics, relaxed stability, and powerful thrust-vectoring engines give it excellent maneuverability and energy potential across its flight envelope, capable of 9-&quot;g&quot; maneuvers at takeoff gross weight with full internal fuel. Its large control surfaces, vortex-generating chines and LERX, and vectoring nozzles provide excellent high alpha (angle of attack) characteristics, and is capable of flying at trimmed alpha of over 60° while maintaining roll control and performing maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev&#x27;s Cobra; vortex impingement on the vertical tail fins did cause more buffeting than initially anticipated, resulting in the strengthening of the fin structure by changing the rear spar from composite to titanium. The computerized triplex-redundant fly-by-wire control system and FADEC make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable, thus giving the pilot carefree handling.

===Stealth===
The F-22 was designed to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar, with radio waves reflected, scattered, or diffracted away from the emitter source towards specific sectors, or absorbed and attenuated. Measures to reduce RCS include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges and continuous curvature of surfaces, internal carriage of weapons, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets and curved vanes that prevent line-of-sight of the engine fan faces and turbines from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio frequency emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft&#x27;s rectangular thrust-vectoring nozzles flatten the exhaust plume and facilitate its mixing with ambient air through shed vortices, which reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing (&quot;heat seeking&quot;) surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special topcoat and active cooling to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.

Compared to previous stealth designs, the F-22 is less reliant on RAM, which are maintenance-intensive and susceptible to adverse weather conditions, and can undergo repairs on the flight line or in a normal hangar without climate control. The F-22 incorporates a &quot;Signature Assessment System&quot; which delivers warnings when the radar signature is degraded and necessitates repair. While the F-22&#x27;s exact RCS is classified, in 2009 Lockheed Martin released information indicating that from certain angles the airplane has an RCS of 0.0001 m2 or −40 dBsm – equivalent to the radar reflection of a &quot;steel marble&quot;; the aircraft can mount a Luneburg lens reflector to mask its RCS. For missions where stealth is required, the mission capable rate is 62–70%. Beginning in 2021, the F-22 has been seen testing a new chrome-like surface coating, speculated to help reduce the F-22&#x27;s detectability by infrared tracking systems.
The effectiveness of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft&#x27;s frontal or side area from the perspective of a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing radar observability. Furthermore, the F-22&#x27;s stealth contouring and radar-absorbent materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size. These are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision. Additionally, while faint or fleeting radar contacts make defenders aware that a stealth aircraft is present, reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much more challenging.

===Avionics===

The aircraft has an integrated avionics system where through sensor fusion, data from all onboard sensor systems as well as off-board inputs are filtered and processed into a combined tactical picture, thus enhancing the pilot&#x27;s situational awareness and reducing workload. Key mission systems include Sanders/General Electric AN/ALR-94 electronic warfare system, Martin Marietta AN/AAR-56 infrared and ultraviolet Missile Launch Detector (MLD), Westinghouse/Texas Instruments AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, TRW Communication/Navigation/Identification (CNI) suite, and Raytheon advanced infrared search and track (IRST) being tested.

The APG-77 radar has a low-observable, active-aperture, electronically scanned antenna with multiple target track-while-scan in all weather conditions; the antenna is tilted back for stealth. Its emissions can be focused to overload enemy sensors as an electronic attack capability. The radar changes frequencies more than 1,000 times per second to lower interception probability and has an estimated range of against an target and or more in narrow beams. The upgraded APG-77(V)1 provides air-to-ground functionality through synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mapping, ground moving target indication/track (GMTI/GMTT), and strike modes. The ALR-94 electronic warfare system, among the most technically complex equipment on the F-22, integrates more than 30 antennas blended into the wings and fuselage for all-round radar warning receiver (RWR) coverage and threat geolocation. It can be used as a passive detector capable of searching targets at ranges (250+ nmi) exceeding the radar&#x27;s, and can provide enough information for a target lock and cue radar emissions to a narrow beam (down to 2° by 2° in azimuth and elevation). Depending on the detected threat, the defensive systems can prompt the pilot to release countermeasures such as flares or chaff. The MLD uses six sensors to provide full spherical infrared coverage while the advanced IRST, housed in a stealthy wing pod, is a narrow field-of-view sensor for long-range passive identification and targeting. To ensure stealth in the radio frequency spectrum, CNI emissions are strictly controlled and confined to specific sectors, with tactical communication between F-22s performed using the directional Inter/Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL); the integrated CNI system, which incorporates a MIDS-JTRS terminal, also manages TACAN, IFF (including Mode 5), and communication through various methods such as HAVE QUICK/SATURN and SINCGARS. The aircraft was also upgraded with an automatic ground collision avoidance system (GCAS).
Information from radar, CNI, and other sensors are processed by two Hughes Common Integrated Processor (CIP) mission computers, each capable of processing up to 10.5 billion instructions per second. The F-22&#x27;s baseline software has some 1.7 million lines of code, the majority involving the mission systems such as processing radar data. The highly integrated nature of the avionics architecture system, as well as the use of the programming language Ada, has made the development and testing of upgrades challenging. To enable more rapid upgrades, the CIPs were upgraded with Curtiss-Wright open mission systems (OMS) processor modules as well as a modular open systems architecture called the Open Systems Enclave (OSE) orchestration platform to allow the avionics suite to interface with containerized software from third-party vendors.

The F-22&#x27;s ability to operate close to the battlefield gives the aircraft threat detection and identification capability comparative with the RC-135 Rivet Joint, and the ability to function as a &quot;mini-AWACS&quot;, though its radar is less powerful than those of dedicated platforms. This allows the F-22 to rapidly designate targets for allies and coordinate friendly aircraft. Although communication with other aircraft types was initially limited to voice, upgrades have enabled data to be transferred through a Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) or via JTIDS/Link 16 traffic through MIDS-JTRS. The IEEE 1394B bus developed for the F-22 was derived from the commercial IEEE 1394 &quot;FireWire&quot; bus system. In 2007, the F-22&#x27;s radar was tested as a wireless data transceiver, transmitting data at 548 megabits per second and receiving at gigabit speed, far faster than the Link 16 system. The radio frequency receivers of the electronic support measures (ESM) system give the aircraft the ability to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) tasks.

===Cockpit===
The F-22 has a glass cockpit with all-digital flight instruments. The monochrome head-up display offers a wide field of view and serves as a primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles. The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned. The canopy&#x27;s dimensions are approximately 140 inches long, 45 inches wide, and 27 inches tall (355 cm × 115 cm × 69 cm) and weighs 360 pounds. The canopy was redesigned after the original design lasted an average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours.

The F-22 has integrated radio functionality, the signal processing systems are virtualized rather than as a separate hardware module. The integrated control panel (ICP) is a keypad system for entering communications, navigation, and autopilot data. Two up-front displays located around the ICP are used to display integrated caution advisory/warning (ICAW) data, CNI data and also serve as the stand-by flight instrumentation group and fuel quantity indicator for redundancy. The stand-by flight group displays an artificial horizon, for basic instrument meteorological conditions. The primary multi-function display (PMFD) is located under the ICP, and is used for navigation and situation assessment. Three secondary multi-function displays are located around the PMFD for tactical information and stores management.

The ejection seat is a version of the ACES II commonly used in USAF aircraft, with a center-mounted ejection control. The F-22 has a complex life support system, which includes the onboard oxygen generation system (OBOGS), protective pilot garments, and a breathing regulator/anti-g (BRAG) valve controlling flow and pressure to the pilot&#x27;s mask and garments. The pilot garments were developed under the Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit (ATAGS) project and protect against chemical/biological hazards and cold-water immersion, counter g-forces and low pressure at high altitudes, and provide thermal relief. Following a series of hypoxia-related issues, the life support system was consequently revised to include an automatic backup oxygen system and a new flight vest valve. In combat environments, the ejection seat includes a modified M4 carbine designated the GAU-5/A.

===Armament===
The F-22 has three internal weapons bays: a large main bay on the bottom of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine inlets; a small bay for countermeasures such as flares is located behind each side bay. The main bay is split along the centerline and can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and each side bay has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range missiles. The primary air-to-air missiles are the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the AIM-9 Sidewinder, with planned integration of the AIM-260 JATM. Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second, during which pneumatic or hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high-speed flight. An internally mounted M61A2 Vulcan 20 mm rotary cannon is embedded in the airplane&#x27;s right wing root with the muzzle covered by a retractable door, which remains closed when the cannon is not firing in order to minimize the negative effect the exposed muzzle on the aircraft&#x27;s radar signature The radar projection of the cannon fire&#x27;s path is displayed on the pilot&#x27;s head-up display.

Although designed for air-to-air missiles, the main bay can replace four launchers with two bomb racks that can each carry one 1,000 lb (450 kg) or four 250 lb (110 kg) bombs for a total of of air-to-surface ordnance. In 2024, Lockheed Martin disclosed its proposed Mako hypersonic missile, a 1,300 lb (590 kg) weapon that can be carried internally in the F-22. While capable of carrying weapons with GPS guidance such as JDAMs and SDBs, the F-22 cannot self-designate laser-guided weapons.
While the F-22 typically carries weapons internally, the wings include four hardpoints, each rated to handle . Each hardpoint can accommodate a pylon that can carry a detachable 600-gallon (2,270 L) external fuel tank or a launcher holding two air-to-air missiles; the two inboard hardpoints are &quot;plumbed&quot; for external fuel tanks. The two outboard hardpoints have since been dedicated to a pair of stealthy pods housing the IRST and mission systems. The aircraft can jettison external tanks and their pylon attachments to restore its low observable characteristics and kinematic performance.

===Maintenance===
Each F-22 requires a three-week packaged maintenance plan (PMP) every 300 flight hours. Its stealth coatings were designed to be more robust and weather-resistant than those of earlier stealth aircraft, yet early coatings failed against rain and moisture when F-22s were initially posted to Guam in 2009. Stealth measures account for almost one third of maintenance, with coatings being particularly demanding. F-22 depot maintenance is performed at Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill AFB, Utah; considerable care is taken during maintenance due to the small fleet size and limited attrition reserve.

F-22s were available for missions 63% of the time on average in 2015, up from 40% when it was introduced in 2005. Maintenance hours per flight hour was also improved from 30 early on to 10.5 by 2009, lower than the requirement of 12; man-hours per flight hour was 43 in 2014. When introduced, the F-22 had a Mean Time Between Maintenance (MTBM) of 1.7 hours, short of the required 3.0; this rose to 3.2 hours in 2012. By fiscal year 2015, the cost per flight hour was $59,116, while the user reimbursement rate was approximately US$35,000 (~$ in ) per flight hour in 2019.

==Operational history==
===Introduction into service===
The F-22 underwent extensive testing before its service introduction. While the first production aircraft was delivered to Edwards AFB in October 2002 for IOT&amp;E and the first jet for the 422nd TES at Nellis AFB arrived in January 2003, IOT&amp;E was continually pushed back from its planned start in mid-2003, with mission avionics stability being particularly challenging. Following a preliminary assessment, called OT&amp;E Phase 1, formal IOT&amp;E began in April 2004 and was completed in December of that year. This milestone marked the successful demonstration of the jet&#x27;s air-to-air mission capability, although the jet was more maintenance intensive than expected. A Follow-On OT&amp;E (FOT&amp;E) in 2005 cleared the F-22&#x27;s air-to-ground mission capability.

The first combat ready F-22 of the 1st Fighter Wing arrived at Langley AFB, Virginia in January 2005 and that December, the USAF announced that the aircraft had achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) with the 94th Fighter Squadron. The unit subsequently participated in Exercise Northern Edge 06 in Alaska in June 2006 and Exercise Red Flag 07–2 at Nellis AFB in February 2007, where it demonstrated the F-22&#x27;s greatly increased air combat capabilities when flying against Red Force Aggressor F-15s and F-16s with a simulated kill ratio of 108–0. These large force exercises also further refined the F-22&#x27;s operational tactics and employment.

The F-22 achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC) in December 2007, when General John Corley of Air Combat Command (ACC) officially declared the F-22s of the integrated active duty 1st Fighter Wing and Virginia Air National Guard 192d Fighter Wing fully operational. This was followed by an Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) of the integrated wing in April 2008, in which it was rated &quot;excellent&quot; in all categories, with a simulated kill-ratio of 221–0. The fielding of the F-22 with its precision strike capability also contributed to the retirement of the F-117 from operational service in 2008, with the 49th Fighter Wing operating the F-22 for a brief period prior to a series of fleet consolidations to reduce long term operational costs; further consolidations to improve availability and pilot training were recommended by the Government Accountability Office in 2018.

===Training===
The 43rd Fighter Squadron was reactivated in 2002 as the F-22 Formal Training Unit (FTU) for the type&#x27;s basic course at Tyndall AFB and the first aircraft for pilot training was delivered in September 2003. Following severe damage to the installation in the wake of Hurricane Michael in 2018, the squadron and its aircraft were relocated to nearby Eglin AFB; although it was initially feared that several jets were lost due to storm damage, all were later repaired and flown out. The FTU and its aircraft were reassigned to the 71st Fighter Squadron at Langley AFB in 2023.

As of 2014, B-Course students require 38 sorties to graduate (previously 43 sorties). Track 1 course pilots, pilots retraining from other aircraft, also saw a reduction in the number of sorties needed to graduate, from 19 to 12 sorties. F-22 students are first trained on the T-38 Talon trainer aircraft. Additional pilot training takes place on the F-16 because the aging T-38 is not rated to sustain higher G-forces and lacks modern avionics. Due to a lack of a modern trainer stand-in that can accurately emulate the F-22, the Air Force often uses F-22s to supplement training, which is costly as the F-22 costs almost 10 times more than the T-38 per flight hour. The upcoming T-7 Red Hawk features modern avionics that better approximate those of the F-22 and F-35. This is scheduled to enter initial operating capability in 2027, several years behind schedule. In 2014 the Air Force stood up the 2nd Fighter Training Squadron at Tyndall AFB which was equipped with T-38s to serve as adversary aircraft to reduce adversary training flights on the F-22s. To reduce operating costs and prolong the F-22&#x27;s service life, some pilot training sorties are performed using flight simulators. The advanced F-22 weapons instructor course at USAF Weapons School is conducted by the 433rd Weapons Squadron at Nellis AFB.

===Initial operational problems===
During the initial years of service, F-22 pilots experienced symptoms as a result of oxygen system issues that include loss of consciousness, memory loss, emotional lability and neurological changes as well as lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; the issues resulted in a fatal mishap in 2010 and four-month grounding in 2011 and subsequent altitude and distance flight restrictions. In August 2012, the DoD found that the BRAG valve, which inflated the pilot&#x27;s vest during high-&quot;g&quot; maneuvers, was defective and restricted breathing and the OBOGS (onboard oxygen generation system) unexpectedly fluctuated oxygen levels at high &quot;g&quot;. A Raptor Aeromedical Working Group had recommended changes in 2005 regarding oxygen supply that were unfunded but received further consideration in 2012. The F-22 CTF and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron eventually determined breathing restrictions as the root cause; coughing symptoms were attributed to acceleration atelectasis from high &quot;g&quot; exposure and OBOGS delivering excessive oxygen concentration. The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed unrelated. Modifications to the life support and oxygen systems, including the installation of an automatic backup, allowed altitude and distance restrictions to be lifted in April 2013.

===Operational service===
Following IOC and large-scale exercises, the F-22 flew its first homeland defense mission in January 2007 under Operation Noble Eagle. In November 2007, F-22s of 90th Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, performed their first North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) interception of two Russian Tu-95MS bombers. Since then, F-22s have also escorted probing Tu-160 bombers.

The F-22 was first deployed overseas in February 2007 with the 27th Fighter Squadron to Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan. This first overseas deployment was initially marred by problems when six F-22s flying from Hickam AFB, Hawaii, experienced multiple software-related system failures while crossing the International Date Line (180th meridian of longitude). The aircraft returned to Hawaii by following tanker aircraft. Within 48 hours, the error was resolved and the journey resumed. Kadena would be a frequent rotation for F-22 units; they have also been involved in training exercises in South Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines.

Defense Secretary Gates initially refused to deploy F-22s to the Middle East in 2007; the type made its first deployment in the region at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE in 2009. In April 2012, F-22s have been rotating into Al Dhafra, less than 200 miles from Iran. In March 2013, the USAF announced that an F-22 had intercepted an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that approached within 16 miles of an MQ-1 Predator flying off the Iranian coastline.
On 22 September 2014, F-22s performed the type&#x27;s first combat sorties by conducting some of the opening strikes of Operation Inherent Resolve, the American-led intervention in Syria; aircraft dropped 1,000-pound GPS-guided bombs on Islamic State targets near Tishrin Dam. Between September 2014 and July 2015, F-22s flew 204 sorties over Syria, dropping 270 bombs at some 60 locations. Throughout their deployment, F-22s conducted close air support (CAS) and also deterred Syrian, Iranian, and Russian aircraft from attacking U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and disrupting U.S. operations in the region. F-22s also participated in the U.S. strikes that defeated pro-Assad and Russian Wagner Group paramilitary forces near Khasham in eastern Syria on 7 February 2018. These strikes notwithstanding, the F-22&#x27;s main role in the operation was conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. The aircraft also performed missions in other regions of the Middle East; in November 2017, F-22s operating alongside B-52s bombed opium production and storage facilities in Taliban-controlled regions of Afghanistan.
To increase deployment responsiveness and reduce logistical footprint in a peer or near-peer conflict, the USAF developed a deployment concept called Rapid Raptor which involves two to four F-22s and one C-17 for logistical support, first proposed in 2008 by two F-22 pilots. The goal was for the type to be able to set up and engage in combat within 24 hours in smaller and more austere environments that would enable more dispersed and survivable disposition of forces. This concept was tested at Wake Island in 2013 and Guam in late 2014. Four F-22s were deployed to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany, Łask Air Base in Poland, and Ämari Air Base in Estonia in August and September 2015 to further test the concept and train with NATO allies in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. The USAF would build on the principles of Rapid Raptor and eventually integrate it into its new operational concept called Agile Combat Employment, which shifts towards distributed operations during peer conflicts; for instance, detachments of F-22s have operated from austere airfields on Tinian and Iwo Jima during exercises.

On 4 February 2023, an F-22 of the 1st Fighter Wing shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon within visual range off the coast of South Carolina at an altitude of 60,000 to , marking the F-22&#x27;s first air-to-air kill. The wreckage landed approximately 6 miles offshore and was subsequently secured by ships of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. F-22s shot down additional high-altitude objects near the coast of Alaska on 10 February and over Yukon on 11 February.

The USAF expects to begin retiring the F-22 in the 2030s as it gets replaced by the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) crewed fighter. In May 2021, Air Force Chief of Staff Charles Q. Brown Jr. said that he envisioned a reduction in the future number of fighter fleets to &quot;four plus one&quot;: the F-22 followed by NGAD, the F-35A, the F-15E followed by F-15EX, the F-16 followed by &quot;MR-X&quot;, and the A-10; the A-10 was later dropped from the plans due that aircraft&#x27;s accelerated retirement. In 2022 the Air Force requested that it be allowed to divest all but three of its Block 20 F-22s at Tyndall AFB. Congress denied the request to divest its 33 non-combat-coded Block 20 aircraft and passed language prohibiting the divestment through FY2026. While the Block 30/35 F-22 remains one of the USAF&#x27;s top priorities and will be continually updated, the service believes the Block 20 aircraft is obsolescent and unsuitable even for training F-22 pilots and that upgrading them to Block 30/35 standards would be cost-prohibitive at $3.5 billion.

==Variants==
;F-22A
:Single-seat version, was designated &quot;F/A-22A&quot; in early 2000s before reverting back to &quot;F-22A&quot; in 2005; 195 built, consisting of 8 test and 187 production aircraft.
;F-22B
:Planned two-seat version with the same combat capabilities as the single-seat version, cancelled in 1996 to save development costs with test aircraft orders converted to F-22A.
;Naval F-22 variant
:Never formally designated, planned carrier-borne variant/derivative for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF) program. Because the NATF needed lower landing speeds than the F-22 for aircraft carrier operations while still attaining Mach 2-class speeds, the design would have incorporated variable-sweep wings; it would also have had expanded weapons carriage, including the AIM-152 AAAM, AGM-88 HARM, and AGM-84 Harpoon. Program was cancelled in 1991 due to tightening budgets.

===Proposed derivatives===
The X-44 MANTA, or &quot;multi-axis, no-tail aircraft&quot;, was a planned experimental aircraft based on the F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup. The aircraft was to be solely controlled by thrust vectoring, without featuring any rudders, ailerons, or elevators. Funding for this program was halted in 2000.

The FB-22 was proposed in the early 2000s as a supersonic stealth regional bomber for the USAF. The design went through several iterations and the later ones would combine an F-22 fuselage with greatly enlarged delta wings and was projected to carry up to 30 Small Diameter Bombs to over , about twice the combat range of the F-22A. The FB-22 proposals were cancelled with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments, in lieu of a larger subsonic strategic bomber with a much greater range; this became the Next-Generation Bomber, although it would be rescoped in 2009 as the Long Range Strike Bomber resulting in the B-21 Raider.

In August 2018, Lockheed Martin proposed an F-22 derivative to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) for its 5th/6th generation F-X program. The design, which was later also proposed to the USAF, would combine a modified F-22 airframe with enlarged wings to increase fuel capacity and combat radius to as well as the avionics and improved stealth coatings of the F-35. The proposal was ultimately not considered by the USAF or JASDF due to cost as well as existing export restrictions and industrial workshare concerns.

==Accidents==
The first F-22 crash occurred during takeoff at Nellis AFB on 20 December 2004, in which the pilot ejected safely before impact. The investigation revealed that a brief interruption in power during an engine shutdown prior to flight caused a flight-control system malfunction; consequently the aircraft design was corrected to avoid the problem. Following a brief grounding, F-22 operations resumed after a review.

On 25 March 2009, an EMD F-22 crashed northeast of Edwards AFB during a test flight, resulting in the death of Lockheed Martin test pilot David P. Cooley. An Air Force Materiel Command investigation found that Cooley momentarily lost consciousness during a high-G maneuver, or g-LOC, then ejected when he found himself too low to recover. Cooley was killed during ejection by blunt-force trauma from windblast due to the aircraft&#x27;s speed. The investigation found no design issues.

On 16 November 2010, an F-22 from Elmendorf AFB crashed, killing the pilot, Captain Jeffrey Haney. F-22s were restricted to flying below 25,000 feet, then grounded during the investigation. The crash was attributed to a bleed air system malfunction after an engine overheat condition was detected, shutting down the Environmental Control System (ECS) and OBOGS. The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame, as he did not react properly to engage the emergency oxygen system. Haney&#x27;s widow sued Lockheed Martin, claiming equipment defects, and later reached a settlement. After the ruling, the emergency oxygen system engagement handle was redesigned and the entire system was eventually replaced by an automatic backup. On 11 February 2013, the DoD&#x27;s Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney, and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling.

On 15 November 2012, an F-22 crashed to the east of Tyndall AFB during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely and no injuries were reported on the ground. The investigation determined that a &quot;chafed&quot; electrical wire ignited the fluid in a hydraulic line, causing a fire that damaged the flight controls.

On 15 May 2020, an F-22 from Eglin Air Force Base crashed during a routine training mission shortly after takeoff; the pilot ejected safely. The cause of the crash was attributed to a maintenance error after an aircraft wash resulting in faulty air data sensor readings.

<text>Yoni (Sanskrit: योनि, ), sometimes called &quot;pindika&quot;, is an abstract or aniconic representation of the Hindu goddess Shakti. It is usually shown with &quot;linga&quot; – its masculine counterpart. Together, they symbolize the merging of microcosmos and macrocosmos, the divine eternal process of creation and regeneration, and the union of the feminine and the masculine that recreates all of existence. The &quot;yoni&quot; is conceptualized as nature&#x27;s gateway of all births, particularly in the esoteric Kaula and Tantra practices, as well as the Shaktism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism.

&quot;Yoni&quot; is a Sanskrit word that has been interpreted to literally mean the &quot;womb&quot;, the &quot;source&quot;, and the female organs of generation. It also connotes the female sexual organs such as &quot;vagina&quot;, &quot;vulva&quot;, and &quot;uterus&quot;, or alternatively to &quot;origin, abode, or source&quot; of anything in other contexts. For example, the Vedanta text &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; metaphorically refers to the metaphysical concept &quot;Brahman&quot; as the &quot;yoni of the universe&quot;. The &quot;yoni&quot; with &quot;linga&quot; iconography is found in Shiva temples and archaeological sites of the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia, as well in sculptures such as the &quot;Lajja Gauri&quot;.

==Etymology and significance==
Yoni appears in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; and other Vedic literature in the sense of feminine life-creating regenerative and reproductive organs, as well as in the sense of &quot;source, origin, fountain, place of birth, womb, nest, abode, fire pit of incubation&quot;. Other contextual meanings of the term include &quot;race, caste, family, fertility symbol, grain or seed&quot;. It is a spiritual metaphor and icon in Hinduism for the origin and the feminine regenerative powers in the nature of existence. The &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; metaphorically calls the metaphysical concept &quot;Brahman&quot; as the &quot;yoni of the universe&quot;, which Adi Shankara states in his commentaries means the material cause and &quot;source of the universe&quot;.

According to Indologists Constance Jones and James D. Ryan, the yoni symbolizes the female principle in all life forms as well as the &quot;earth&#x27;s seasonal and vegetative cycles&quot;, and thus is an emblem of cosmological significance. The yoni is a metaphor for nature&#x27;s gateway of all births, particularly in the Shaktism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism, as well as the esoteric Kaula and Tantra sects. &quot;Yoni&quot; together with the &quot;lingam&quot; is a symbol for &quot;prakriti&quot;, its cyclic creation and dissolution. According to Corinne Dempsey – a professor of Religious Studies, yoni is an &quot;aniconic form of the goddess&quot; in Hinduism, the feminine principle &quot;Shakti&quot;.

The &quot;yoni&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;pindika&quot;. The base on which the linga-yoni sit is called the &quot;pitha&quot;, but in some texts such as the &quot;Nisvasa tattva samhita&quot; and &quot;Mohacudottara&quot;, the term &quot;pitha&quot; generically refers to the base and the yoni.

==History==
The reverence for yoni, state Jones and Ryan, is probably pre-Vedic. Figurines recovered from Zhob valley and dated to the 4th millennium BCE show pronounced breasts and yoni, and these may have been fertility symbols used in prehistoric times that ultimately evolved into spiritual symbols. According to David Lemming, the yoni worship tradition dates to the pre-Vedic period, over the 4000 BCE to 1000 BCE period.

The yoni has served as a divine symbol from ancient times, and it may well be the oldest spiritual icon not only in India but across many ancient cultures. Some in the orthodox Western cultures, states the Indologist Laura Amazzone, have treated the feminine sexual organs and sexuality in general as a taboo subject, but in Indic religions and other ancient cultures the yoni has long been accepted as profound cosmological and philosophical truth, of the feminine potential and power, one mysteriously interconnected with the natural periodic cycles of moon, earth and existence.
The yoni is considered to be an abstract representation of Shakti and Devi, the creative force that moves through the entire universe. In tantra, yoni is the origin of life.

=== Archaeology ===
The colonial era archaeologists John Marshall and Ernest Mackay proposed that certain polished stones with holes found at Harappan sites may be evidence of yoni-linga worship in Indus Valley civilisation. Scholars such as Arthur Llewellyn Basham dispute whether such artifacts discovered at the archaeological sites of Indus Valley sites are yoni. For example, Jones and Ryan state that lingam/yoni shapes have been recovered from the archaeological sites at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, part of the Indus Valley civilisation. In contrast, Jane McIntosh states that truncated ring stones with holes were once considered as possibly yonis. Later discoveries at the Dholavira site, and further studies, have proven that these were pillar components because the &quot;truncated ring stones with holes&quot; are integral architectural components of the pillars. However, states McIntosh, the use of these structures in architecture does not rule out their simultaneous religious significance as yoni.

According to the Indologist Asko Parpola, &quot;it is true that Marshall&#x27;s and Mackay&#x27;s hypotheses of linga and yoni worship by the Harappans has rested on rather slender grounds, and that for instance the interpretation of the so-called ring-stones as yonis seems untenable&quot;. He quotes Dales 1984 paper, which states &quot;with the single exception of the unidentified photography of a realistic phallic object in Marshall&#x27;s report, there is no archaeological evidence to support claims of special sexually-oriented aspects of Harappan religion&quot;. However, adds Parpola, a re-examination at Indus Valley sites suggest that the Mackay&#x27;s hypothesis cannot be ruled out because erotic and sexual scenes such as ithyphallic males, naked females, a human couple having intercourse and trefoil imprints have now been identified at the Harappan sites. The &quot;finely polished circular stand&quot; found by Mackay may be yoni although it was found without the linga. The absence of linga, states Parpola, may be because it was made from wood which did not survive.

===Sanskrit literature===
The term &quot;yoni&quot; and its derivatives appear in ancient medicine and surgery-related Sanskrit texts such as the &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot; and &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot;. In this context, &quot;yoni&quot; broadly refers to &quot;female sexual and procreative organs&quot;. According to Indologists Rahul Das and Gerrit Meulenbeld known for their translations and reviews of ancient Sanskrit medical and other literature, &quot;yoni&quot; &quot;usually denotes the vagina or the vulva, in a technical sense it also includes the uterus along with these; moreover, yoni- can at times mean simply &#x27;womb, uterus&#x27; too, though it [Cakrapanidata&#x27;s commentary on &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot;] does so relatively seldom&quot;. According to Amit Rupapara et al., &quot;yoni-roga&quot; means &quot;gynecological disorders&quot; and &quot;yoni-varti&quot; means &quot;vaginal suppository&quot;. The &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot; dedicates its 30th chapter in Chikitsa Sthana to &quot;yoni-vyapath&quot; or &quot;gynecological disorders&quot;.

In sexuality-related Sanskrit literature, as well as Tantric literature, yoni connotes many layers of meanings. Its literal meaning is &quot;female genitalia&quot;, but it also encompasses other meanings such as &quot;womb, origin, and source&quot;. In some Indic literature, yoni means vagina, and other organs regarded as &quot;divine symbol of sexual pleasure, the matrix of generation and the visible form of Shakti&quot;.

===Orientalist literature===
The colonial era Orientalists and Christian missionaries, raised in the Victorian mold where sex and sexual imagery were a taboo subject, were shocked by and were hostile to the yoni iconography and reverence they witnessed. The 19th and early 20th-century colonial and missionary literature described yoni, lingam-yoni, and related theology as obscene, corrupt, licentious, hyper-sexualized, puerile, impure, demonic and a culture that had become too feminine and dissolute. To the Hindus, particularly the Shaivites, these icons and ideas were the abstract, a symbol of the entirety of creation and spirituality. The colonial disparagement in part triggered the opposite reaction from Bengali nationalists, who more explicitly valorised the feminine. Swami Vivekananda called for the revival of the Mother Goddess as a feminine force, inviting his countrymen to &quot;proclaim her to all the world with the voice of peace and benediction&quot;.

According to Wendy Doniger, the terms lingam and yoni became explicitly associated with human sexual organs in the western imagination after the widely popular first &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; translation by Sir Richard Burton in 1883. In his translation, even though the original Sanskrit text does not use the words lingam or yoni for sexual organs, Burton adroitly sidestepped being viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by using them throughout in place of words such as penis, vulva, and vagina to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to &quot;anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away.&quot; Similar Orientalist literature of the Christian missionaries and the British era, states Doniger, stripped all spiritual meanings and insisted on the Victorian vulgar interpretation only, which had &quot;a negative effect on the self-perception that Hindus had of their own bodies&quot; and they became &quot;ashamed of the more sensual aspects of their own religious literature&quot;. Some contemporary Hindus, states Doniger, in their passion to spiritualize Hinduism and for their Hindutva campaign have sought to sanitize the historic earthly sexual meanings, and insist on the abstract spiritual meaning only.

== Iconography and temples ==
Within Shaivism, the sect dedicated to the god Shiva, the Shakti is his consort and both have aniconic representations: lingam for Shiva, yoni for Shakti. The yoni iconography is typically represented in the form of a horizontally placed round or square base with a lipped edge and an opening in the center usually with a cylindrical lingam. Often, one side of this base extends laterally, and this projection is called the &quot;yoni-mukha&quot;. An alternate symbol for yoni that is commonly found in Indic arts is the lotus, an icon found in temples.

The yoni is one of the sacred icons of the Hindu Shaktism tradition, with historic arts and temples dedicated to it. Some significant artworks related to yoni include the Lajja Gauri found in many parts of India and the Kamakhya Temple in Assam. Both of these have been dated to the late 1st millennium CE, with the major expansion of the Kamakhya temple that added a new sanctum above the natural rock yoni attached to an older temple being dated to the 16th-century Koch dynasty period.

===Lajja Gauri===

The Lajja Gauri is an ancient icon that is found in many Devi-related temples across India and one that has been unearthed at several archaeological sites in South Asia. The icon represents yoni but with more context and complexity. According to the Art Historian Carol Bolon, the Lajja Gauri icon evolved over time with increasing complexity and richness. It is a fertility icon and symbolizes the procreative and regenerative powers of mother earth, &quot;the elemental source of all life, animal and plant&quot;, the vivifier and &quot;the support of all life&quot;. The earliest representations were variants of aniconic pot, the second stage represented it as the three-dimensional artwork with no face or hands but a lotus-head that included yoni, chronologically followed by the third stage that added breasts and arms to the lotus-headed figure. The last stage was an anthropomorphic figure of a squatting naked goddess holding lotus and motifs of agricultural abundance spread out showing her yoni as if she is giving birth or sexually ready to procreate. According to Bolon, the different aniconic and anthropomorphic representations of Lajja Gauri are symbols for the &quot;yoni of Prithvi (Earth)&quot;, she as womb.

The Lajja Gauri iconography – sometimes referred to by other names such as Yellamma or Ellamma – has been discovered in many South Indian sites such as the Aihole (4th to 12th-century), Nagarjunakonda (4th century Lajja Gauri inscription and artwork), Balligavi, Elephanta Caves, Ellora Caves, many sites in Gujarat (6th century), central India such as Nagpur, northern parts of the subcontinent such as Bhaktapur (Nepal), Kausambi and many other sites.

===Kamakhya Temple===
The Kamakhya temple is one of the oldest &quot;shakta pithas&quot; in South Asia or sacred pilgrimage sites of the Shaktism tradition. Textual, inscriptional and archaeological evidence suggests that the temple has been revered in the Shaktism tradition continuously since at least the 8th-century CE, as well as the related esoteric tantric worship traditions. The Shakta tradition believes, states Hugh Urban – a professor of Religious Studies primarily focusing on South Asia, that this temple site is the &quot;locus of goddess&#x27; own yoni&quot;.
The regional tantric tradition considers this yoni site as the &quot;birthplace&quot; or &quot;principal center&quot; of tantra. While the temple premises, walls and mandapas have numerous depictions of goddess Kamakhya in her various roles, include those relating to her procreative powers, as a martial warrior, and as a nurturing motherly figure (one image near the western gate shows her nursing a baby with her breast, dated to 10th-12th century). The temple sanctum, however, has no idols. The sanctum features a yoni-shaped natural rock with a fissure and a natural water spring flowing over it. The Kamakhya yoni is linked to the Shiva-Sati legend, both mentioned in the early puranic literature related to Shaktism such as the &quot;Kalika Purana&quot;.

Every year, about the start of monsoons, the natural spring turns red because of iron oxide and &quot;sindoor&quot; (red pigment) anointed by the devotees and temple priests. This is celebrated as a symbol of the menstruating goddess, and as the Ambubachi Mela (also known as &quot;Ambuvaci&quot; or &quot;ameti&quot;), an annual fertility festival held in June. During Ambubachi, a symbolic annual menstruation course of the goddess Kamakhya is worshipped in the Kamakhya Temple. The temple stays closed for three days and then reopens to receive pilgrims and worshippers. The sanctum with the yoni of the goddess is one of the most important pilgrimage sites for the Shakti tradition, attracting between 70,000 and 200,000 pilgrims during the &quot;Ambubachi Mela&quot; alone from the northeastern and eastern states of India such as West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It also attracts yogis, tantrikas, sadhus, aghoris as well as other monks and nuns from all over India.

===Yantra===
In esoteric traditions such as tantra, particularly the Sri Chakra tradition, the main icon (yantra) has nine interlocking triangles. Five of these point downwards and these are consider symbols of yoni, while four point upwards and these are symbols of linga. The interlocking represents the interdependent union of the feminine and masculine energies for the creation and destruction of existence.

===Southeast Asia===
Yoni typically with linga is found in historic stone temples and panel reliefs of Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. In Cham literature, yoni is sometimes referred to as &quot;Awar&quot;, while the linga is referred to as &quot;Ahier&quot;.

== Other uses ==

* Yoni mudra is a modern gesture in meditation used to reduce distraction during the beginning of yoga practice.
* In the Thai language the medial canthus (the sharp corner of the eye closest to the nose) is called &quot;Yoni Tha&quot; where &quot;Tha&quot; means the eye.

<text>Seven Days (also written as 7 Days) is an American science fiction television series based on the premise of time travel. It was created by Christopher and Zachary Crowe, and aired on UPN from October 7, 1998 to May 29, 2001.

==Synopsis==
The plot follows a secret branch of the US National Security Agency, which has developed a time travelling device based upon alien technology found at Roswell. As the opening of the show recounts, the Chronosphere, or Backstep Sphere, is capable of sending “one human being back in time seven days” to avert disasters. The show&#x27;s title refers to the chief limitation of the technology, namely that a traveler can only &quot;backstep&quot; seven days due to limitations imposed by the device&#x27;s fuel source and its reactor. As the fuel source is limited, there is a strict mandate that the backstep is confined to events relating directly to national security. The backstep team and the equipment are stationed in a base in a secret location somewhere in the desert of Nevada called &quot;Never Never Land&quot;—a play on Area 51, or Groom Lake Flight Test Facilities, also known as &quot;Dreamland&quot;.

The first episode begins with an attack on the White House, after which &quot;Project Backstep&quot; receives permission to attempt a launch. Under pressure to identify the perpetrators and find the exact sequence of events leading to the attack, the team coordinates with branches of the CIA, US Military, and sympathetic world powers to plan a response while the scientific team attempts to finish the technology. They search for a test pilot, eventually selecting Frank Parker, a former Navy SEAL and CIA operative whose son died in the aftermath of the attack, to be the world&#x27;s first &quot;Chrononaut&quot;. After succeeding in both time travel and in preventing the attack (thus reversing the deaths of his family), Parker chooses to stay with the program.

==Cast==

* U.S. Navy Commander Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Bartholomew Parker (Jonathan LaPaglia), a former Navy SEAL and ex-CIA operative recruited by the program to be the project&#x27;s &quot;chrononaut&quot;. While having served with distinction, he is not the program&#x27;s initial choice due to a history of emotional instability stemming from an extended period of torture while being held prisoner in Somalia; however, Donovan vouches for Frank, and facilitates his release from a secret mental health facility for troubled operatives with classified knowledge. Frank&#x27;s testing reveals that in addition to the determination and physical stamina necessary to succeed as a Navy SEAL, he has an exceptionally high pain tolerance, a photographic memory, and a capacity for unorthodox problem-solving. In addition to his military service, several plot elements focus on his troubled youth in Philadelphia, his attempts to reconcile relationships with his ex-wife and estranged son, and his attempts to use time travel for personal gain. The latter is often played for comedic effect as a series of running gags where his future knowledge of sports betting is rendered defunct due to changes in the timeline, and his romantic pursuit of Dr. Vukavitch succeed only to be undone when he travels through time. Throughout the series, he also clashes with the project&#x27;s head of security, Nathan Ramsey, due to the restrictive nature of his service with the program. His codename in the field is &quot;Conundrum.&quot;
* Dr. Olga Vukavitch (Justina Vail), a Russian doctor who worked in the Russian version of the Backstep Project, which, without any technology from the Roswell crash, never reached operational level. She lost her husband in an accident. She grows to like Frank (whom she addresses formally) at times, but is almost invariably put off by some new show of his crassness or arrogance (although Frank often manages to overcome this, only to have to Backstep). Despite this, many episodes reveal that she has a hidden affection for Frank, and she always thinks of him shortly before she dies in a previous timeline.
* U.S. Navy Captain Craig Donovan (Don Franklin), Navy SEAL and Project Backstep&#x27;s military advisor/tactical coordinator and backup chrononaut. He is an old friend of Frank&#x27;s from the SEAL teams, who led the operation to rescue him in Mogadishu. As a Chrononaut candidate, Donovan was an early lead during the testing phase, due to his excellent hand-eye coordination, physical conditioning, and psychological stability. Compared with Frank, the scientists believed that Donovan would be the better overall pilot for the chronosphere, and that his coordination would ensure less risk to the equipment; however, Talmadge eventually selects Frank due to the advantages of his pain tolerance and photographic memory, though Donovan never begrudges this and is Frank&#x27;s strongest supporter. In spite of his &#x27;backup&#x27; status, the series never depicts him taking Frank&#x27;s place. He has, on occasion, assumed command of the project, its security forces, and the scientific branch during the end-of-the world situations that frequently precede a backstep as project leaders were killed or incapacitated. He is well-liked and respected by the scientific, security, and military staff and was Ramsey&#x27;s preferred choice.
* Dr. Bradley Talmadge (Alan Scarfe), director of the Backstep Project operations and a long-time member of the NSA intelligence community. Although middle-aged, he is shown several times to still have excellent combat skills.
* NSA Agent Nathan Ramsey (Nick Searcy), Backstep Project security chief. A short-tempered, highly opinionated man, he opposes Frank becoming chrononaut and is therefore made the prime target of Parker&#x27;s practical jokes. Ramsey is portrayed to be conservative, and he always makes politically incorrect statements supporting the use of force to quickly end problems (but the way he puts it is always funny instead of malicious). Ramsey&#x27;s area of expertise is intelligence and counter-intelligence. His job is to use the information that Frank Parker gives him to avert disasters, but Frank commonly fulfills the missions himself. Ramsey is also the man the NSA sends out to retrieve Frank when the Ex-Seal makes unscheduled disappearances from the base.
* Dr. Isaac Mentnor (Norman Lloyd) (seasons 1–2, guest appearances in season 3), a scientist with a shadowy past that&#x27;s tied into the Roswell cover-up, Dr. Mentnor was the man who initially conceived the Backstep project.
* Dr. John Ballard (Sam Whipple) (seasons 1–2). The wheelchair-using resident genius on the Backstep Project. Ballard is responsible for calibrating and maintaining the Spheres and keeping them active to allow for a quick Backstep if needed. In the fourth episode of season 3, he won a tropical island in a poker match in Las Vegas and married two girls, but he&#x27;s not sure whom, since he was a little drunk at the time. So he took some time off to straighten things out.
* Andrew &quot;Hooter&quot; Owsley (Kevin Christy) (season 3). A young physics prodigy whom Ballard suggested as his replacement. He works with Dr. Mentnor to enhance the existing Backstep technology and has been shown occasionally to have a secret crush on Olga.
* Carrie Quigley (Anne Marie Loder) (season 3).

==Production==
Three seasons of &quot;Seven Days&quot; were produced. All three seasons have been shown in North America, and by the BBC in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Seven Days&quot; was based on an idea from Kerry McCluggage, then-president of Paramount Television. He pitched the idea to Christopher Crowe, who mixed it with his own research on Area 51 to create the series. The show wasn&#x27;t a hit with reviewers, who criticized the show&#x27;s &quot;flimsy&quot; premise and violence.

Original cast member Sam Whipple, who played Dr. John Ballard, left the series four episodes into the third season, due to diagnosis of a cancer that was eventually fatal. He was replaced by Kevin Christy as young physics prodigy Andrew &quot;Hooter&quot; Owsley for the rest of the season.

Justina Vail, who played Dr. Olga Vukavitch, quit the series before the end of the third season, though she agreed to film a few extra scenes to wrap-up her character&#x27;s arc. Her departure and the tensions within the cast, as well as the show&#x27;s low ratings, played a role in UPN&#x27;s decision to not renew the series for a fourth season.

==Episodes==


==DVD release==
On November 26, 2018, Visual Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 for the first time.

==Awards==
&quot;Seven Days&quot; was nominated for six awards, winning one. Actress Justina Vail won a Saturn Award in 2000 for her performance on the show.

<doc id="66306" wikidata="Q422021" url="?curid=66306" title="Osmium tetroxide">
<text>Osmium tetroxide (also osmium(VIII) oxide) is the chemical compound with the formula OsO4. The compound is noteworthy for its many uses, despite its toxicity and the rarity of osmium. It also has a number of unusual properties, one being that the solid is volatile. The compound is colourless, but most samples appear yellow. This is most likely due to the presence of the impurity OsO2, which is yellow-brown in colour. In biology, its property of binding to lipids has made it a widely-used stain in electron microscopy.

==Physical properties==
Osmium(VIII) oxide forms monoclinic crystals. It has a characteristic acrid chlorine-like odor. The element name osmium is derived from &quot;osme&quot;, Greek for &quot;odor&quot;. OsO4 is volatile: it sublimes at room temperature. It is soluble in a wide range of organic solvents. It is moderately soluble in water, with which it reacts reversibly to form osmic acid (see below). &quot;Pure&quot; osmium(VIII) oxide is probably colourless; it has been suggested that its yellow hue is attributable due to osmium dioxide (OsO2) impurities. The osmium tetroxide molecule is tetrahedral and therefore nonpolar. This nonpolarity helps OsO4 penetrate charged cell membranes.

==Structure and electron configuration==
The osmium of OsO4 has an oxidation number of VIII; however, the metal does not possess a corresponding 8+ charge as the bonding in the compound is largely covalent in character (the ionization energy required to produce a formal 8+ charge also far exceeds the energies available in normal chemical reactions). The osmium atom exhibits double bonds to the four oxide ligands, resulting in a 16 electron complex. OsO4 is isoelectronic with permanganate and chromate ions.

==Synthesis==
OsO4 is formed slowly when osmium powder reacts with O2 at ambient temperature. Reaction of bulk solid requires heating to 400 °C.

==Reactions==

===Oxidation of alkenes===
Alkenes add to OsO4 to give diolate species that hydrolyze to &quot;cis&quot;-diols. The net process is called dihydroxylation. This proceeds via a [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between the OsO4 and alkene to form an intermediate osmate ester that rapidly hydrolyses to yield the vicinal diol. As the oxygen atoms are added in a concerted step, the resulting stereochemistry is &quot;cis&quot;.

OsO4 is expensive and highly toxic, making it an unappealing reagent to use in stoichiometric amounts. However, its reactions are made catalytic by adding reoxidants to reoxidise the Os(VI) by-product back to Os(VIII). Typical reagents include H2O2 (Milas hydroxylation), N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (Upjohn dihydroxylation) and K3Fe(CN)6/water. These reoxidants do not react with the alkenes on their own. Other osmium compounds can be used as catalysts, including osmate(VI) salts ([OsO2(OH)4)]2−, and osmium trichloride hydrate (OsCl3·&quot;x&quot;H2O). These species oxidise to osmium(VIII) in the presence of such oxidants.

Lewis bases such as tertiary amines and pyridines increase the rate of dihydroxylation. This &quot;ligand-acceleration&quot; arises via the formation of adduct OsO4L, which adds more rapidly to the alkene. If the amine is chiral, then the dihydroxylation can proceed with enantioselectivity (see Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation). OsO4 does not react with most carbohydrates.

The process can be extended to give two aldehydes in the Lemieux–Johnson oxidation, which uses periodate to achieve diol cleavage and to regenerate the catalytic loading of OsO4. This process is equivalent to that of ozonolysis.

===Coordination chemistry===
OsO4 is a Lewis acid and a mild oxidant. It reacts with alkaline aqueous solution to give the perosmate anion . This species is easily reduced to osmate anion, .

When the Lewis base is an amine, adducts are also formed. Thus OsO4 can be stored in the form of osmeth, in which OsO4 is complexed with hexamine. Osmeth can be dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diluted in an aqueous buffer solution to make a dilute (0.25%) working solution of OsO4.

With tert-BuNH2, the imido derivative is produced:
:OsO4 + Me3CNH2 → OsO3(NCMe3) + H2O
Similarly, with NH3 one obtains the nitrido complex:
:OsO4 + NH3 + KOH → K[Os(N)O3] + 2 H2O
The [Os(N)O3]− anion is isoelectronic and isostructural with OsO4.

OsO4 is very soluble in tert-butyl alcohol. In solution, it is readily reduced by hydrogen to osmium metal. The suspended osmium metal can be used to catalytically hydrogenate a wide variety of organic chemicals containing double or triple bonds.
:OsO4 + 4 H2 → Os + 4 H2O

OsO4 undergoes &quot;reductive carbonylation&quot; with carbon monoxide in methanol at 400 K and 200 sbar to produce the triangular cluster Os3(CO)12:

:3 OsO4 + 24 CO → Os3(CO)12 + 12 CO2

====Oxofluorides====
Osmium forms several oxofluorides, all of which are very sensitive to moisture.
Purple &quot;cis&quot;-OsO2F4 forms at 77 K in an anhydrous HF solution:
: OsO4 + 2 KrF2 → &quot;cis&quot;-OsO2F4 + 2 Kr + O2

OsO4 also reacts with F2 to form yellow OsO3F2:
: 2 OsO4 + 2 F2 → 2 OsO3F2 + O2

OsO4 reacts with one equivalent of [Me4N]F at 298 K and 2 equivalents at 253 K:
: OsO4 + [Me4N]F → [Me4N][OsO4F]

: OsO4 + 2 [Me4N]F → [Me4N]2[&quot;cis&quot;-OsO4F2]

==Uses==

===Organic synthesis===
In organic synthesis OsO4 is widely used to oxidize alkenes to the vicinal diols, adding two hydroxyl groups at the same side (syn addition). See reaction and mechanism above. This reaction has been made both catalytic (Upjohn dihydroxylation) and asymmetric (Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation).

Osmium(VIII) oxide is also used in catalytic amounts in the Sharpless oxyamination to give vicinal amino-alcohols.

In combination with sodium periodate, OsO4 is used for the oxidative cleavage of alkenes (Lemieux-Johnson oxidation) when the periodate serves both to cleave the diol formed by dihydroxylation, and to reoxidize the OsO3 back to OsO4. The net transformation is identical to that produced by ozonolysis. Below an example from the total synthesis of Isosteviol.

===Biological staining===
OsO4 is a widely used staining agent used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide contrast to the image. This staining method may also be known in the literature as the OTO (osmium-thiocarbohydrazide-osmium) method, or osmium impregnation technique or simply as osmium staining. As a lipid stain, it is also useful in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as an alternative to sputter coating. It embeds a heavy metal directly into cell membranes, creating a high electron scattering rate without the need for coating the membrane with a layer of metal, which can obscure details of the cell membrane. In the staining of the plasma membrane, osmium(VIII) oxide binds phospholipid head regions, thus creating contrast with the neighbouring protoplasm (cytoplasm). Additionally, osmium(VIII) oxide is also used for fixing biological samples in conjunction with HgCl2. Its rapid killing abilities are used to quickly kill live specimens such as protozoa. OsO4 stabilizes many proteins by transforming them into gels without destroying structural features. Tissue proteins that are stabilized by OsO4 are not coagulated by alcohols during dehydration. Osmium(VIII) oxide is also used as a stain for lipids in optical microscopy. OsO4 also stains the human cornea (see safety considerations).

===Polymer staining===
It is also used to stain copolymers preferentially, the best known example being block copolymers where one phase can be stained so as to show the microstructure of the material. For example, styrene-butadiene block copolymers have a central polybutadiene chain with polystyrene end caps. When treated with OsO4, the butadiene matrix reacts preferentially and so absorbs the oxide. The presence of a heavy metal is sufficient to block the electron beam, so the polystyrene domains are seen clearly in thin films in TEM.

===Osmium ore refining===
OsO4 is an intermediate in the extraction of osmium from its ores. Osmium-containing residues are treated with sodium peroxide (Na2O2) forming Na2[OsO4(OH)2], which is soluble. When exposed to chlorine, this salt gives OsO4. In the final stages of refining, crude OsO4 is dissolved in alcoholic NaOH forming Na2[OsO2(OH)4], which, when treated with NH4Cl, to give (NH4)4[OsO2Cl2]. This salt is reduced under hydrogen to give osmium.

===Buckminsterfullerene adduct===
OsO4 allowed for the confirmation of the soccer ball model of buckminsterfullerene, a 60-atom carbon allotrope. The adduct, formed from a derivative of OsO4, was C60(OsO4)(4-&quot;tert&quot;-butylpyridine)2. The adduct broke the fullerene&#x27;s symmetry, allowing for crystallization and confirmation of the structure of C60 by X-ray crystallography.

===Medicine===
The only known clinical use of osmium tetroxide is for the treatment of arthritis. The lack of reports of long-term side effects from the local administration of osmium tetroxide (OsO4) suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible, though this depends on the osmium compound administered.

==Safety considerations==

OsO4 will irreversibly stain the human cornea, which can lead to blindness. The permissible exposure limit for osmium(VIII) oxide (8 hour time-weighted average) is 2 μg/m3. Osmium(VIII) oxide can penetrate plastics and food packaging, and therefore must be stored in glass under refrigeration.

<doc id="66313" wikidata="Q82682" url="?curid=66313" title="Redox">
<text>Redox ( , , reduction–oxidation or oxidation–reduction) is a type of chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of the reactants change. Oxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state, while reduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state. The oxidation and reduction processes occur simultaneously in the chemical reaction.

There are two classes of redox reactions:
* Electron-transfer – Only one (usually) electron flows from the atom, ion, or molecule being oxidized to the atom, ion, or molecule that is reduced. This type of redox reaction is often discussed in terms of redox couples and electrode potentials.
* Atom transfer – An atom transfers from one substrate to another. For example, in the rusting of iron, the oxidation state of iron atoms increases as the iron converts to an oxide, and simultaneously, the oxidation state of oxygen decreases as it accepts electrons released by the iron. Although oxidation reactions are commonly associated with forming oxides, other chemical species can serve the same function. In hydrogenation, bonds like C=C are reduced by transfer of hydrogen atoms.

==Terminology==
&quot;Redox&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;REDuction&quot; and &quot;OXidation.&quot; The term &quot;redox&quot; was first used in 1928.

Oxidation is a process in which a substance loses electrons. Reduction is a process in which a substance gains electrons.

The processes of oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously and cannot occur independently. In redox processes, the reductant transfers electrons to the oxidant. Thus, in the reaction, the reductant or reducing agent loses electrons and is oxidized, and the oxidant or oxidizing agent gains electrons and is reduced. The pair of an oxidizing and reducing agent that is involved in a particular reaction is called a redox pair. A redox couple is a reducing species and its corresponding oxidizing form, e.g., / .The oxidation alone and the reduction alone are each called a &quot;half-reaction&quot; because two half-reactions always occur together to form a whole reaction.

In electrochemical reactions the oxidation and reduction processes do occur simultaneously but are separated in space.

===Oxidants===
Oxidation originally implied a reaction with oxygen to form an oxide. Later, the term was expanded to encompass substances that accomplished chemical reactions similar to those of oxygen. Ultimately, the meaning was generalized to include all processes involving the loss of electrons or the increase in the oxidation state of a chemical species. Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances (cause them to lose electrons) are said to be oxidative or oxidizing, and are known as oxidizing agents, oxidants, or oxidizers. The oxidant removes electrons from another substance, and is thus itself reduced. Because it &quot;accepts&quot; electrons, the oxidizing agent is also called an electron acceptor. Oxidants are usually chemical substances with elements in high oxidation states (e.g., , , , , ), or else highly electronegative elements (e.g. O2, F2, Cl2, Br2, I2) that can gain extra electrons by oxidizing another substance.

Oxidizers are oxidants, but the term is mainly reserved for sources of oxygen, particularly in the context of explosions. Nitric acid is a strong oxidizer.

===Reductants===

Substances that have the ability to reduce other substances (cause them to gain electrons) are said to be reductive or reducing and are known as reducing agents, reductants, or reducers. The reductant transfers electrons to another substance and is thus itself oxidized. Because it donates electrons, the reducing agent is also called an electron donor. Electron donors can also form charge transfer complexes with electron acceptors. The word reduction originally referred to the loss in weight upon heating a metallic ore such as a metal oxide to extract the metal. In other words, ore was &quot;reduced&quot; to metal. Antoine Lavoisier demonstrated that this loss of weight was due to the loss of oxygen as a gas. Later, scientists realized that the metal atom gains electrons in this process. The meaning of reduction then became generalized to include all processes involving a gain of electrons. Reducing equivalent refers to chemical species which transfer the equivalent of one electron in redox reactions. The term is common in biochemistry. A reducing equivalent can be an electron or a hydrogen atom as a hydride ion.

Reductants in chemistry are very diverse. Electropositive elemental metals, such as lithium, sodium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and aluminium, are good reducing agents. These metals donate electrons relatively readily.

Hydride transfer reagents, such as NaBH4 and LiAlH4, reduce by atom transfer: they transfer the equivalent of hydride or H−. These reagents are widely used in the reduction of carbonyl compounds to alcohols. A related method of reduction involves the use of hydrogen gas (H2) as sources of H atoms.

==Rates, mechanisms, and energies==

Redox reactions can occur slowly, as in the formation of rust, or rapidly, as in the case of burning fuel. Electron transfer reactions are generally fast, occurring within the time of mixing.

The mechanisms of atom-transfer reactions are highly variable because many kinds of atoms can be transferred. Such reactions can also be quite complex, involving many steps. The mechanisms of electron-transfer reactions occur by two distinct pathways, inner sphere electron transfer and outer sphere electron transfer.

Analysis of bond energies and ionization energies in water allows calculation of the thermodynamic aspects of redox reactions.

==Standard electrode potentials (reduction potentials)==

Each half-reaction has a standard electrode potential (&quot;E&quot;), which is equal to the potential difference or voltage at equilibrium under standard conditions of an electrochemical cell in which the cathode reaction is the half-reaction considered, and the anode is a standard hydrogen electrode where hydrogen is oxidized:
:H2 → H+ + e−

The electrode potential of each half-reaction is also known as its reduction potential (&quot;E&quot;), or potential when the half-reaction takes place at a cathode. The reduction potential is a measure of the tendency of the oxidizing agent to be reduced. Its value is zero for H+ + e− → H2 by definition, positive for oxidizing agents stronger than H+ (e.g., +2.866 V for F2) and negative for oxidizing agents that are weaker than H+ (e.g., −0.763V for Zn2+).

For a redox reaction that takes place in a cell, the potential difference is:
:&quot;E&quot; = &quot;E&quot; – &quot;E&quot;

However, the potential of the reaction at the anode is sometimes expressed as an &quot;oxidation potential&quot;:
:&quot;E&quot; = –&quot;E&quot;
The oxidation potential is a measure of the tendency of the reducing agent to be oxidized but does not represent the physical potential at an electrode. With this notation, the cell voltage equation is written with a plus sign
:&quot;E&quot; = &quot;E&quot; + &quot;E&quot;

==Examples of redox reactions==

In the reaction between hydrogen and fluorine, hydrogen is being oxidized and fluorine is being reduced:

This spontaneous reaction releases 542 kJ per 2 g of hydrogen because the H-F bond is much stronger than the F-F bond. This reaction can be analyzed as two half-reactions. The oxidation reaction converts hydrogen to protons:

The reduction reaction converts fluorine to the fluoride anion:

The half-reactions are combined so that the electrons cancel:

The protons and fluoride combine to form hydrogen fluoride in a non-redox reaction:
:2 H+ + 2 F− → 2 HF
The overall reaction is:

===Metal displacement===

In this type of reaction, a metal atom in a compound or solution is replaced by an atom of another metal. For example, copper is deposited when zinc metal is placed in a copper(II) sulfate solution:

In the above reaction, zinc metal displaces the copper(II) ion from the copper sulfate solution, thus liberating free copper metal. The reaction is spontaneous and releases 213 kJ per 65 g of zinc.

The ionic equation for this reaction is:

As two half-reactions, it is seen that the zinc is oxidized:

And the copper is reduced:

===Other examples===
* The reduction of nitrate to nitrogen in the presence of an acid (denitrification):
* The combustion of hydrocarbons, such as in an internal combustion engine, produces water, carbon dioxide, some partially oxidized forms such as carbon monoxide, and heat energy. Complete oxidation of materials containing carbon produces carbon dioxide.
* The stepwise oxidation of a hydrocarbon by oxygen, in organic chemistry, produces water and, successively: an alcohol, an aldehyde or a ketone, a carboxylic acid, and then a peroxide.

===Corrosion and rusting===
* The term corrosion refers to the electrochemical oxidation of metals in reaction with an oxidant such as oxygen. Rusting, the formation of iron oxides, is a well-known example of electrochemical corrosion: it forms as a result of the oxidation of iron metal. Common rust often refers to iron(III) oxide, formed in the following chemical reaction:
* The oxidation of iron(II) to iron(III) by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an acid:
::
:Here the overall equation involves adding the reduction equation to twice the oxidation equation, so that the electrons cancel:

===Disproportionation===
A disproportionation reaction is one in which a single substance is both oxidized and reduced. For example, thiosulfate ion with sulfur in oxidation state +2 can react in the presence of acid to form elemental sulfur (oxidation state 0) and sulfur dioxide (oxidation state +4).
Thus one sulfur atom is reduced from +2 to 0, while the other is oxidized from +2 to +4.

==Redox reactions in industry==
Cathodic protection is a technique used to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell. A simple method of protection connects protected metal to a more easily corroded &quot;sacrificial anode&quot; to act as the anode. The sacrificial metal, instead of the protected metal, then corrodes. 

Oxidation is used in a wide variety of industries, such as in the production of cleaning products and oxidizing ammonia to produce nitric acid.

Redox reactions are the foundation of electrochemical cells, which can generate electrical energy or support electrosynthesis. Metal ores often contain metals in oxidized states, such as oxides or sulfides, from which the pure metals are extracted by smelting at high temperatures in the presence of a reducing agent. The process of electroplating uses redox reactions to coat objects with a thin layer of a material, as in chrome-plated automotive parts, silver plating cutlery, galvanization and gold-plated jewelry.

==Redox reactions in biology==

Many essential biological processes involve redox reactions. Before some of these processes can begin, iron must be assimilated from the environment.

Cellular respiration, for instance, is the oxidation of glucose (C6H12O6) to CO2 and the reduction of oxygen to water. The summary equation for cellular respiration is:

The process of cellular respiration also depends heavily on the reduction of NAD+ to NADH and the reverse reaction (the oxidation of NADH to NAD+). Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are complementary, but photosynthesis is not the reverse of the redox reaction in cellular respiration:

Biological energy is frequently stored and released using redox reactions. Photosynthesis involves the reduction of carbon dioxide into sugars and the oxidation of water into molecular oxygen. The reverse reaction, respiration, oxidizes sugars to produce carbon dioxide and water. As intermediate steps, the reduced carbon compounds are used to reduce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH, which then contributes to the creation of a proton gradient, which drives the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is maintained by the reduction of oxygen. In animal cells, mitochondria perform similar functions.

The term &quot;redox state&quot; is often used to describe the balance of GSH/GSSG, NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH in a biological system such as a cell or organ. The redox state is reflected in the balance of several sets of metabolites (e.g., lactate and pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), whose interconversion is dependent on these ratios. Redox mechanisms also control some cellular processes. Redox proteins and their genes must be co-located for redox regulation according to the CoRR hypothesis for the function of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts.

===Redox cycling===
Wide varieties of aromatic compounds are enzymatically reduced to form free radicals that contain one more electron than their parent compounds. In general, the electron donor is any of a wide variety of flavoenzymes and their coenzymes. Once formed, these anion free radicals reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and regenerate the unchanged parent compound. The net reaction is the oxidation of the flavoenzyme&#x27;s coenzymes and the reduction of molecular oxygen to form superoxide. This catalytic behavior has been described as a futile cycle or redox cycling.

==Redox reactions in geology==
Minerals are generally oxidized derivatives of metals. Iron is mined as its magnetite (Fe3O4). Titanium is mined as its dioxide, usually in the form of rutile (TiO2). These oxides must be reduced to obtain the corresponding metals, often achieved by heating these oxides with carbon or carbon monoxide as reducing agents. Blast furnaces are the reactors where iron oxides and coke (a form of carbon) are combined to produce molten iron. The main chemical reaction producing the molten iron is:

== Redox reactions in soils ==
Electron transfer reactions are central to myriad processes and properties in soils, and redox potential, quantified as Eh (platinum electrode potential (voltage) relative to the standard hydrogen electrode) or pe (analogous to pH as -log electron activity), is a master variable, along with pH, that controls and is governed by chemical reactions and biological processes. Early theoretical research with applications to flooded soils and paddy rice production was seminal for subsequent work on thermodynamic aspects of redox and plant root growth in soils. Later work built on this foundation, and expanded it for understanding redox reactions related to heavy metal oxidation state changes, pedogenesis and morphology, organic compound degradation and formation, free radical chemistry, wetland delineation, soil remediation, and various methodological approaches for characterizing the redox status of soils.

== Mnemonics ==
The key terms involved in redox can be confusing. For example, a reagent that is oxidized loses electrons; however, that reagent is referred to as the reducing agent. Likewise, a reagent that is reduced gains electrons and is referred to as the oxidizing agent. These mnemonics are commonly used by students to help memorise the terminology:
* &quot;OIL RIG&quot; — oxidation is loss of electrons, reduction is gain of electrons
* &quot;LEO the lion says GER [grr]&quot; — loss of electrons is oxidation, gain of electrons is reduction
* &quot;LEORA says GEROA&quot; — the loss of electrons is called oxidation (reducing agent); the gain of electrons is called reduction (oxidizing agent).
* &quot;RED CAT&quot; and &quot;AN OX&quot;, or &quot;AnOx RedCat&quot; (&quot;an ox-red cat&quot;) — reduction occurs at the cathode and the anode is for oxidation
* &quot;RED CAT gains what AN OX loses&quot; – reduction at the cathode gains (electrons) what anode oxidation loses (electrons)
* &quot;PANIC&quot; – Positive Anode and Negative is Cathode. This applies to electrolytic cells which release stored electricity, and can be recharged with electricity. PANIC does not apply to cells that can be recharged with redox materials. These galvanic or voltaic cells, such as fuel cells, produce electricity from internal redox reactions. Here, the positive electrode is the cathode and the negative is the anode.

<text>Solid-state chemistry, also sometimes referred as materials chemistry, is the study of the synthesis, structure, and properties of solid phase materials. It therefore has a strong overlap with solid-state physics, mineralogy, crystallography, ceramics, metallurgy, thermodynamics, materials science and electronics with a focus on the synthesis of novel materials and their characterization. A diverse range of synthetic techniques, such as the ceramic method and chemical vapour depostion, make solid-state materials. Solids can be classified as crystalline or amorphous on basis of the nature of order present in the arrangement of their constituent particles. Their elemental compositions, microstructures, and physical properties can be characterized through a variety of analytical methods.

==History==

Because of its direct relevance to products of commerce, solid state inorganic chemistry has been strongly driven by technology. Progress in the field has often been fueled by the demands of industry, sometimes in collaboration with academia. Applications discovered in the 20th century include zeolite and platinum-based catalysts for petroleum processing in the 1950s, high-purity silicon as a core component of microelectronic devices in the 1960s, and “high temperature” superconductivity in the 1980s. The invention of X-ray crystallography in the early 1900s by William Lawrence Bragg was an enabling innovation. Our understanding of how reactions proceed at the atomic level in the solid state was advanced considerably by Carl Wagner&#x27;s work on oxidation rate theory, counter diffusion of ions, and defect chemistry. Because of his contributions, he has sometimes been referred to as the &quot;father of solid state chemistry&quot;.

==Synthetic methods==
Given the diversity of solid-state compounds, an equally diverse array of methods are used for their preparation. Synthesis can range from high-temperature methods, like the ceramic method, to gas methods, like chemical vapour deposition. Often, the methods prevent defect formation or produce high-purity products.

===High-temperature methods===

==== Ceramic method ====
The ceramic method is one of the most common synthesis techniques. The synthesis occurs entirely in the solid state.  The reactants are ground together, formed into a pellet using a pellet press and hydraulic press, and heated at high temperatures. When the temperature of the reactants are sufficient, the ions at the grain boundaries react to form desired phases. Generally ceramic methods give polycrystalline powders, but not single crystals. 

Using a mortar and pestle, ResonantAcoustic mixer, or ball mill, the reactants are ground together, which decreases size and increases surface area of the reactants. If the mixing is not sufficient, we can use techniques such as co-precipitation and sol-gel. A chemist forms pellets from the ground reactants and places the pellets into containers for heating. The choice of container depends on the precursors, the reaction temperature and the expected product. For example, metal oxides are typically synthesized in silica or alumina containers. A tube furnace heats the pellet. Tube furnaces are available up to maximum temperatures of 2800oC. 

====Molten flux synthesis====
Molten flux synthesis can be an efficient method for obtaining single crystals. In this method, the starting reagents are combined with flux, an inert material with a melting point lower than that of the starting materials. The flux serves as a solvent. After the reaction, the excess flux can be washed away using an appropriate solvent or it can be heat again to remove the flux by sublimation if it is a volatile compound. 

Crucible materials have a great role to play in molten flux synthesis. The crucible should not react with the flux or the starting reagent. If any of the material is volatile, it is recommended to conduct the reaction in a sealed ampule. If the target phase is sensitive to oxygen, a carbon- coated fused silica tube or a carbon crucible inside a fused silica tube is often used which prevents the direct contact between the tube wall and reagents.

==== Chemical vapour transport ====
Chemical vapour transport results in very pure materials. The reaction typically occurs in a sealed ampoule. A transporting agent, added to the sealed ampoule, produces a volatile intermediate species from the solid reactant. For metal oxides, the transporting agent is usually Cl2 or HCl. The ampoule has a temperature gradient, and, as the gaseous reactant travels along the gradient, it eventually deposits as a crystal. An example of an industrially-used chemical vapor transport reaction is the Mond process. The Mond process involves heating impure nickel in a stream of carbon monoxide to produce pure nickel.
=== Low-temperature methods ===

==== Intercalation method ====
Intercalation synthesis is the insertion of molecules or ions between layers of a solid. The layered solid has weak intermolecular bonds holding its layers together. The process occurs via diffusion. Intercalation is further driven by ion exchange, acid-base reactions or electrochemical reactions. The intercalation method was first used in China with the discovery of porcelain. Also, graphene is produced by the intercalation method, and this method is the principle behind lithium-ion batteries.

=== Solution methods ===
It is possible to use solvents to prepare solids by precipitation or by evaporation. At times, the solvent is a hydrothermal that is under pressure at temperatures higher than the normal boiling point. A variation on this theme is the use of flux methods, which use a salt with a relatively low melting point as the solvent.

=== Gas methods ===

Many solids react vigorously with gas species like chlorine, iodine, and oxygen. Other solids form adducts, such as CO or ethylene. Such reactions are conducted in open-ended tubes, which the gasses are passed through. Also, these reactions can take place inside a measuring device such as a TGA. In that case, stoichiometric information can be obtained during the reaction, which helps identify the products.

==== Chemical vapour deposition ====
Chemical vapour deposition is a method widely used for the preparation of coatings and semiconductors from molecular precursors. A carrier gas transports the gaseous precursors to the material for coating.

==Characterization==
This is the process in which a material’s chemical composition, structure, and physical properties are determined using a variety of analytical techniques.

===New phases===
Synthetic methodology and characterization often go hand in hand in the sense that not one but a series of reaction mixtures are prepared and subjected to heat treatment. Stoichiometry, a numerical relationship between the quantities of reactant and product, is typically varied systematically. It is important to find which stoichiometries will lead to new solid compounds or solid solutions between known ones. A prime method to characterize the reaction products is powder diffraction because many solid-state reactions will produce polycrystalline molds or powders. Powder diffraction aids in the identification of known phases in the mixture. If a pattern is found that is not known in the diffraction data libraries, an attempt can be made to index the pattern. The characterization of a material&#x27;s properties is typically easier for a product with crystalline structures.

=== Compositions and structures ===

Once the unit cell of a new phase is known, the next step is to establish the stoichiometry of the phase. This can be done in several ways. Sometimes the composition of the original mixture will give a clue, under the circumstances that only a product with a single powder pattern is found or a phase of a certain composition is made by analogy to known material, but this is rare.

Often, considerable effort in refining the synthetic procedures is required to obtain a pure sample of the new material. If it is possible to separate the product from the rest of the reaction mixture, elemental analysis methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can be used. The detection of scattered and transmitted electrons from the surface of the sample provides information about the surface topography and composition of the material. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is a technique that uses electron beam excitation. Exciting the inner shell of an atom with incident electrons emits characteristic X-rays with specific energy to each element. The peak energy can identify the chemical composition of a sample, including the distribution and concentration.Similar to EDX, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) involves the generation of characteristic X-rays upon interaction with the sample. The intensity of diffracted rays scattered at different angles is used to analyze the physical properties of a material such as phase composition and crystallographic structure. These techniques can also be coupled to achieve a better effect. For example, SEM is a useful complement to EDX due to its focused electron beam, it produces a high-magnification image that provides information on the surface topography. Once the area of interest has been identified, EDX can be used to determine the elements present in that specific spot. Selected area electron diffraction can be coupled with TEM or SEM to investigate the level of crystallinity and the lattice parameters of a sample.

==== More information ====
X-ray diffraction is also used due to its imaging capabilities and speed of data generation. The latter often requires &quot;revisiting&quot; and refining the preparative procedures and that are linked to the question of which phases are stable at what composition and what stoichiometry. In other words, what the phase diagram looks like. An important tool in establishing this are thermal analysis techniques like DSC or DTA and increasingly also, due to the advent of synchrotrons, temperature-dependent powder diffraction. Increased knowledge of the phase relations often leads to further refinement in synthetic procedures in an iterative way. New phases are thus characterized by their melting points and their stoichiometric domains. The latter is important for the many solids that are non-stoichiometric compounds. The cell parameters obtained from XRD are particularly helpful to characterize the homogeneity ranges of the latter.

=== Local structure ===
In contrast to the large structures of crystals, the local structure describes the interaction of the nearest neighbouring atoms. Methods of nuclear spectroscopy use specific nuclei to probe the electric and magnetic fields around the nucleus. E.g. electric field gradients are very sensitive to small changes caused by lattice expansion/compression (thermal or pressure), phase changes, or local defects. Common methods are Mössbauer spectroscopy and perturbed angular correlation.

=== Optical properties ===
For metallic materials, their optical properties arise from the collective excitation of conduction electrons. The coherent oscillations of electrons under electromagnetic radiation along with associated oscillations of the electromagnetic field are called surface plasmon resonances. The excitation wavelength and frequency of the plasmon resonances provide information on the particle&#x27;s size, shape, composition, and local optical environment.

For non-metallic materials or semiconductors, they can be characterized by their band structure. It contains a band gap that represents the minimum energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. The band gap can be determined using Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy to predict the photochemical properties of the semiconductors.

===Further characterization===
In many cases, new solid compounds are further characterized by a variety of techniques that straddle the fine line that separates solid-state chemistry from solid-state physics. See Characterisation in material science for additional information.

<doc id="66316" wikidata="Q201554" url="?curid=66316" title="Burette">
<text>A burette (also spelled as &quot;buret&quot;) is a graduated glass tube with a tap at one end, for delivering known volumes of a liquid, especially in titrations. It is a long, graduated glass tube, with a stopcock at its lower end and a tapered capillary tube at the stopcock&#x27;s outlet. The flow of liquid from the tube to the burette tip is controlled by the stopcock valve. 

There are two main types of burette; the volumetric burette and the piston burette. A volumetric burette delivers measured volumes of liquid. Piston burettes are similar to syringes, but with a precision bore and a plunger. Piston burettes may be manually operated or may be motorized. A weight burette delivers measured weights of a liquid.

==Overview==
A burette is a volumetric measuring glassware which is used in analytical chemistry for the accurate dispensing of a liquid, especially of one of the reagents in a titration. The burette tube carries graduated marks from which the dispensed volume of the liquid can be determined. Compared to a volumetric pipette, a burette has similar precision if used to its full capacity, but as it is usually used to deliver less than its full capacity, a burette is slightly less precise than a pipette.

The burette is used to measure the volume of a dispensed substance, but is different from a graduated cylinder as its graduations measure from top to bottom. Therefore, the difference between the starting and the final volume is equal to the amount dispensed. The precision and control of the burette over other means of adding solution is beneficial for use in titration.

== Volumetric burette ==

A volumetric burette can be made of glass or plastic, and is a straight tube with a graduation scale. At the tip of burette, there are a stopcock and valve to control the flow of the chemical solution. The barrel of the stopcock can be made of glass or the plastic PTFE. Stopcocks with glass barrels need to be lubricated with vaseline or a specialized grease. Burettes are manufactured for specific tolerances, designated as class A or B and this also is etched on the glass.

=== Burette reading ===
In order to measure the amount of solution added in or drained out, the burette must be observed at eye level straight to the bottom of the meniscus. The liquid in the burette should be completely free of bubbles to ensure accurate measurements. The difference in volume can be calculated by taking the difference of the final and initial recorded volume. Using the burette with a colorless solution may make it difficult to observe the bottom of the meniscus, so the black strip technique can make it easier to accurately observe and record measurements.

=== Specification ===
The specification of a volumetric burette indicates its properties, such as the nominal volume, volume unit, error limit, and accuracy class, plus other related details from the manufacturer. The nominal volume and error limit is usually given in units of mL or cm3. Another specification commonly found on burettes is the calibration mark &quot;TD&quot; or &quot;Ex&quot;. This stands for &quot;calibrated to deliver&quot;, indicating that the printed volume is accurate when the burette is used to deliver (rather than contain) a solution. Another commonly indicated specification is the accuracy class, including class A and class B. Class A is preferred to Class B when volumetric accuracy is important, as it has a narrower range of error with accuracy up to 0.1 percent compared to 0.2 percent in Class B burette. 
== Digital burette ==
Digital burettes are based on a syringe design. The barrel and plunger may be made of glass. With liquids that corrode glass, including solutions of alkali, the barrel and plunger may be made of polyethylene or another resistant plastic material. The barrel is held in a fixed position and the plunger is moved incrementally either by turning wheel by hand, or by means of a step motor. The volume is shown on a digital display. A high-precision syringe may be used to deliver very precise aliquots. Motorized digital burettes may be controlled by a computer; for example, a titration may be recorded digitally and then subject to numerical processing to find the titer at an end-point.

== History ==
The first burette was invented in 1845 by the French chemist Étienne-Ossian Henry (1798–1873). In 1855, the German chemist Karl Friedrich Mohr (1806–1879) presented an improved version of Henry&#x27;s burette, having graduations inscribed on the tube of the burette.

The word &quot;burette&quot; was coined in 1824 by the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778–1850).

<text>Group 6, numbered by IUPAC style, is a group of elements in the periodic table. Its members are chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), and seaborgium (Sg). These are all transition metals and chromium, molybdenum and tungsten are refractory metals.

The electron configuration of these elements do not follow a unified trend, though the outermost shells do correlate with trends in chemical behavior:

&quot;Group 6&quot; is the new IUPAC name for this group; the old style name was &quot;&quot;group VIB&quot; in the old US system (CAS) or &quot;group VIA&quot;&quot; in the European system (old IUPAC). Group 6 must not be confused with the group with the old-style group crossed names of either &quot;VIA&quot; (US system, CAS) or &quot;VIB&quot; (European system, old IUPAC). &quot;That&quot; group is now called group 16.
==History==
===Discoveries===
Chromium was first reported on July 26, 1761, when Johann Gottlob Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the Beryozovskoye mines in the Ural Mountains of Russia, which he named &quot;Siberian red lead,&quot; which was found out in less than 10 years to be a bright yellow pigment. Though misidentified as a lead compound with selenium and iron components, the mineral was crocoite with a formula of PbCrO4. Studying the mineral in 1797, Louis Nicolas Vauquelin produced chromium trioxide by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric acid, and metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven a year later. He was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious gemstones, such as ruby or emerald.

Molybdenite—the principal ore from which molybdenum is now extracted—was previously known as molybdena, which was confused with and often implemented as though it were graphite. Like graphite, molybdenite can be used to blacken a surface or as a solid lubricant. Even when molybdena was distinguishable from graphite, it was still confused with a galena (a common lead ore), which took its name from Ancient Greek &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;lead&quot;. It was not until 1778 that Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele realized that molybdena was neither graphite nor lead. He and other chemists then correctly assumed that it was the ore of a distinct new element, named &quot;molybdenum&quot; for the mineral in which it was discovered. Peter Jacob Hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum by using carbon and linseed oil in 1781.

Regarding tungsten, in 1781 Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time named tungsten). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested that it might be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, in Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element.

Seaborgium was first produced by a team of scientists led by Albert Ghiorso who worked at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, California, in 1974. They created seaborgium by bombarding atoms of californium-249 with ions of oxygen-18 until seaborgium-263 was produced.

===Historical development and uses===
During the 1800s, chromium was primarily used as a component of paints and in tanning salts. At first, crocoite from Russia was the main source, but in 1827, a larger chromite deposit was discovered near Baltimore, United States. This made the United States the largest producer of chromium products until 1848 when large deposits of chromite where found near Bursa, Turkey. Chromium was used for electroplating as early as 1848, but this use only became widespread with the development of an improved process in 1924.

For about a century after its isolation, molybdenum had no industrial use, owing to its relative scarcity, difficulty extracting the pure metal, and the immaturity of the metallurgical subfield. Early molybdenum steel alloys showed great promise in their increased hardness, but efforts were hampered by inconsistent results and a tendency toward brittleness and recrystallization. In 1906, William D. Coolidge filed a patent for rendering molybdenum ductile, leading to its use as a heating element for high-temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten-filament light bulbs; oxide formation and degradation require that moly be physically sealed or held in an inert gas. In 1913, Frank E. Elmore developed a flotation process to recover molybdenite from ores; flotation remains the primary isolation process. During the first World War, demand for molybdenum spiked; it was used both in armor plating and as a substitute for tungsten in high-speed steels. Some British tanks were protected by 75 mm (3 in) manganese steel plating, but this proved to be ineffective. The manganese steel plates were replaced with 25 mm (1 in) molybdenum-steel plating allowing for higher speed, greater maneuverability, and better protection. After the war, demand plummeted until metallurgical advances allowed extensive development of peacetime applications. In World War II, molybdenum again saw strategic importance as a substitute for tungsten in steel alloys.

In World War II, tungsten played a significant role in background political dealings. Portugal, as the main European source of the element, was put under pressure from both sides, because of its deposits of wolframite ore at Panasqueira. Tungsten&#x27;s resistance to high temperatures and its strengthening of alloys made it an important raw material for the arms industry.

==Chemistry==
Unlike other groups, the members of this family do not show patterns in its electron configuration, as two lighter members of the group are exceptions from the Aufbau principle:
Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first three members of the group. The chemistry of seaborgium is not very established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with its upper neighbors in the periodic table. The elements in the group, like those of groups 7–11, have high melting points, and form volatile compounds in higher oxidation states. All the elements of the group are relatively nonreactive metals with a high melting points (1907 °C, 2477 °C, 3422 °C); that of tungsten is the highest of all metals. The metals form compounds in different oxidation states: chromium forms compounds in all states from −2 to +6: disodium pentacarbonylchromate, disodium decacarbonyldichromate, bis(benzene)chromium, tripotassium pentanitrocyanochromate, chromium(II) chloride, chromium(III) oxide, chromium(IV) chloride, potassium tetraperoxochromate(V), and chromium(VI) dichloride dioxide; the same is also true for molybdenum and tungsten, but the stability of the +6 state grows down the group. Depending on oxidation states, the compounds are basic, amphoteric, or acidic; the acidity grows with the oxidation state of the metal.

==Occurrence and production==

Chromium is a very common naturally occurring element. It is the 21st most abundant element in the Earth&#x27;s crust with an average concentration of 100 ppm. The most common oxidation states for chromium are zero, trivalent, and hexavalent states. Most naturally occurring chromium is in the hexavalent state. About two-fifths of the worlds chromium are produced in South Africa, with Kazakhstan, India, Russia, and Turkey following. Chromium is mined as chromite ore.

Molybdenum is refined mainly from molybdenite. It is mainly mined in the United States, China, Chile, and Peru, with the total amount produced being 200,000 tonnes per year.

Tungsten is not a common element on Earth, having an average concentration of 1.5 ppm in Earth&#x27;s crust. Tungsten is mainly found in the minerals wolframite and scheelite, and it usually never occurs as a free element in nature. The largest producers of tungsten in the world are China, Russia, and Portugal.

Seaborgium is a transuranium element that is made artificially by bombarding californium-249 with oxygen-18 nuclei. It is artificial, therefore it does not occur in nature.

==Precautions==
Hexavalent chromium compounds are genotoxic carcinogens. Seaborgium is a radioactive synthetic element that is not found in nature; the most stable known isotope has a half-life of approximately 14 minutes.

==Applications==
* Alloys
* Catalysts
* High temperature and refractory applications, such as welding electrodes and kiln components.
* Metallurgy, sometimes used in jet engines and gas turbines.
* Dyes and pigments
* Tanning
* hard materials

==Biological occurrences==
Group 6 is notable in that it contains some of the only elements in periods 5 and 6 with a known role in the biological chemistry of living organisms: molybdenum is common in enzymes of many organisms, and tungsten has been identified in an analogous role in enzymes from some archaea, such as &quot;Pyrococcus furiosus&quot;. In contrast, and unusually for a first-row d-block transition metal, chromium appears to have few biological roles, although it is thought to form part of the glucose metabolism enzyme in some mammals.

<text>M is a 1931 German mystery thriller film directed by Fritz Lang and starring Peter Lorre as Hans Beckert, a serial killer who targets children, in his third screen role. Both Lang&#x27;s first sound film and an early example of a procedural drama, &quot;M&quot; centers on the efforts of both a city&#x27;s police force and its criminal syndicates to apprehend a serial child-murderer.

The film&#x27;s screenplay was written by Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou. It features many cinematic innovations, including the use of long tracking shots and a musical &quot;leitmotif&quot; in the form of &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot;, which is repeatedly whistled by Lorre&#x27;s character. Lang regarded the film as his magnum opus, and it is widely considered one of the greatest films of all time and an indispensable influence on modern crime and thriller fiction.

An American remake under the same title, directed by Joseph Losey, was released in 1951.

== Plot ==
In Berlin, a group of children are playing an elimination game in the courtyard of an apartment building using a macabre chant about a child-killer. Frau Beckmann sets the table for lunch, waiting for her daughter Elsie to come home from school. A wanted poster warns of a serial killer preying on children, as anxious parents wait outside a school.

Elsie leaves school, bouncing a ball on her way home. She is approached by Hans Beckert, who is whistling &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; by Edvard Grieg. He offers to buy her a balloon from a blind street vendor, and walks and talks with her. Elsie&#x27;s place at the table remains empty, her ball rolls away through a patch of grass, and her balloon gets briefly caught in the telephone lines overhead before blowing away in the wind.

In the wake of Elsie&#x27;s disappearance, anxiety runs high among the public. Beckert sends an anonymous letter to the newspapers taking credit for the child murders and promising that he will commit others; the police extract clues from the letter using the new techniques of fingerprinting and handwriting analysis. Under mounting pressure from the government, the police work around the clock. Inspector Karl Lohmann, head of the homicide squad, instructs his men to intensify their search and to check the records of recently released psychiatric patients, focusing on any with a history of violence against children. They stage frequent raids in seedier parts of the city to question known criminals, disrupting organized crime so badly that (&quot;The Safecracker&quot;) summons the bosses of Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Ringvereine&quot; to a conference to address the situation. They decide to organize their own manhunt, assigning beggars to watch the children. The police search Beckert&#x27;s rented room, find evidence there connecting him to both the letter and a past crime scene, and lie in wait to arrest him.

Beckert sees a young girl in the reflection of a shop window and begins to follow her, but stops when the girl meets her mother. He encounters another girl and befriends her, but the blind balloon vendor recognizes his whistling. The vendor alerts one of his friends, who follows Beckert and sees him inside a shop with the girl. As the two exit onto the street, the man chalks the letter &quot;M&quot; (for , &quot;murderer&quot;) onto his palm, pretends to trip, and bumps into Beckert, marking the back of his overcoat with the letter. The girl notices the chalk and offers to clean it for him, but before she finishes, Beckert realizes he is being watched and flees without her.

Attempting to evade the beggars, Beckert hides inside a large office building just before the workers leave for the evening. The beggars call , who arrives at the building with a team of other criminals. They capture and torture one of the watchmen for information and, after capturing the other two, search the building and catch Beckert in the attic. When one of the watchmen trips the silent alarm, the criminals narrowly escape with their prisoner before the police arrive. Franz, one of the criminals, is left behind in the confusion and captured by the police. By falsely claiming that one of the watchmen was killed during the break-in, Lohmann tricks Franz into admitting that the gang&#x27;s only motive was to find Beckert and revealing their plans for him.

The criminals take Beckert to an abandoned distillery to face a kangaroo court. He finds a large, silent crowd awaiting him. Beckert is given a &quot;lawyer&quot; who gamely argues in his defense but fails to win any sympathy from the improvised jury. Beckert delivers an impassioned monologue, saying that he cannot control his homicidal urges, while the other criminals present break the law by choice. He questions why they believe they have any right to judge him:
What right have you to speak? Criminals! Perhaps you are even proud of yourselves! Proud of being able to crack into safes, or climb into buildings or cheat at cards. All of which, it seems to me, you could just as easily give up, if you had learned something useful, or if you had jobs, or if you were not such lazy pigs. I can not help myself! I have no control over this evil thing that is inside me—the fire, the voices, the torment!
Beckert pleads to be handed over to the police. His &quot;lawyer&quot; points out that , presiding over the proceedings, is wanted on three counts of manslaughter, and that it is unjust to execute an insane man. Just as the mob is about to kill Beckert, the police arrive to arrest both him and the criminals.

As a panel of judges prepares to deliver their verdict at Beckert&#x27;s trial, the mothers of three of his victims weep in the gallery. Frau Beckmann says that &quot;no sentence will bring the dead children back&quot; and &quot;one has to keep closer watch over the children&quot;. The screen fades to black as she adds, &quot;All of you&quot;.

== Cast ==

== Production ==
Lang placed an advertisement in a newspaper in 1930 stating that his next film would be (&quot;Murderer Among Us&quot;) and that it was about a child murderer. He immediately began receiving threatening letters in the mail and was also denied a studio space to shoot the film at the Staaken Studios. When Lang confronted the head of Staaken Studio to find out why he was being denied access, the studio head informed Lang that he was a member of the Nazi party and that the party suspected that the film was meant to depict the Nazis. This assumption was based entirely on the film&#x27;s original title and the Nazi party relented when told the plot.

&quot;M&quot; was eventually shot in six weeks at a &quot;Staaken Zeppelinhalle&quot; studio, just outside Berlin. Lang made the film for Nero-Film, rather than with UFA or his own production company. It was produced by Nero studio head Seymour Nebenzal who later produced Lang&#x27;s &quot;The Testament of Dr. Mabuse&quot;. Working titles for the film included (&quot;A City Searches for a Murderer&quot;) and (&quot;Your Murderer Looks at You&quot;). While researching for the film, Lang spent eight days inside a mental institution in Germany and met several child murderers, including Peter Kürten. He used several real criminals as extras in the film and eventually 25 cast members were arrested during the film&#x27;s shooting. Peter Lorre was cast in the lead role of Hans Beckert, acting for the film during the day and appearing on stage in Valentine Katayev&#x27;s &quot;Squaring the Circle&quot; at night.

Lang did not show any acts of violence or deaths of children on screen and later said that by only suggesting violence, he forced &quot;each individual member of the audience to create the gruesome details of the murder according to their personal imagination&quot;.
&quot;M&quot; has been said, by various critics and reviewers, to be based on serial killer Peter Kürten—the &quot;Vampire of Düsseldorf&quot;—whose crimes took place in the 1920s. Lang denied that he drew from this case in an interview in 1963 with film historian Gero Gandert: &quot;At the time I decided to use the subject matter of &quot;M&quot;, there were many serial killers terrorizing Germany—Haarmann, Grossmann, Kürten, Denke, [...]&quot;. Inspector Karl Lohmann is based on Ernst Gennat, then director of the Berlin criminal police.

Lang&#x27;s depiction of the Berlin underworld in the film was inspired by the real &quot;Ringvereine&quot;. The film&#x27;s portrayal of the &quot;Ringvereine&quot; as organized with a board of directors that were dominated by a charismatic master criminal was based on reality. Likewise, the practice of the &quot;Ringvereine&quot; shown in the film of providing financial support for the families of imprisoned members was also based on reality. The break-in of an office building depicted in the film was inspired by the real life 1929 break-in of the Disconto Bank in Berlin by the Sass brothers gang, though unlike in the film the objective was larceny, not to capture a serial killer. The &quot;Ringvereine&quot;, which were officially wrestling associations that existed for the physical betterment of German men, always sought to promote a very &#x27;respectable&#x27;, almost middle-class image of themselves. Like the Mafia, the &quot;Ringvereine&quot; paradoxically portrayed themselves as the guardians of society&#x27;s values, who upheld a certain social order. The image the &quot;Ringvereine&quot; sought to project was as &quot;professionals&quot; whose crimes did not harm ordinary people. Though the &quot;Ringvereine&quot; were known to be gangsters, their hierarchal structure and strict discipline led to a certain popular admiration for them as a force for social order unlike the psychopathic serial killers who murdered random strangers for reasons that often seemed unfathomable, sparking widespread fear and dread. In an article originally published in &quot;Die Filmwoche&quot;, Lang wrote that the crime scene in Germany was &quot;such compelling cinematic material that I lived in constant fear that someone else would exploit this idea before me&quot;.

The Weimar Republic was marked by intense debates about the morality and efficiency of capital punishment, with the political left arguing that the death penalty was barbaric while the right-wing argued that the death penalty was needed to maintain law and order. Adding to the debate was popular interest in the new science of psychiatry, with many psychiatrists arguing that crime was caused by damaged minds and emotions which could be cured. In the background was a popular obsessive fear of crime and social breakdown, which was fed by sensationalist newspaper coverage of crime. In addition, for many conservative Germans, the Weimar republic was itself born of crime, namely the November Revolution of 1918 which began with the High Seas Fleet mutiny. According to this viewpoint, its origins in mutiny and revolution made the Weimar Republic an illegitimate state that could not maintain social order. Lang followed these debates closely and incorporated them into several of his Weimar-era films. The debate at Beckert&#x27;s &quot;trial&quot; about whether he deserved to be killed or not paralleled the contemporary debates about capital punishment in Germany. The fact that &quot;Der Schränker&quot;, a career criminal, serves as both the prosecutor and judge at the kangaroo court, egging on the mob of criminals to kill Beckert, seems to suggest that Lang&#x27;s sympathy was with the abolitionists. The arguments that &quot;Der Schränker&quot; makes at the kangaroo court, namely that certain people are so evil that they deserved to be killed for the good of society, was precisely the same argument made by supporters of the death penalty.

The incorporation of social issues in the film can be seen through the lens of Jeffrey Jerome Cohen’s &quot;Monster Culture (Seven Theses)&quot;. The first of these theses states that “The monster is born only at this metaphoric crossroads, as an embodiment of a certain cultural moment—of a time, a feeling, and a place.” Beckert, as the &quot;monster&quot; in this film, embodies the cultural moment, reflecting Weimar society&#x27;s interest in morality and criminality.

=== Use of sound ===
&quot;M&quot; was Lang&#x27;s first sound film, and he experimented with the new technology. It has a dense and complex soundtrack, as opposed to the more theatrical &quot;talkies&quot; being released at the time. The soundtrack includes a narrator, sounds occurring off-camera, sounds motivating action and suspenseful moments of silence before sudden noise. Lang was also able to make fewer cuts in the film&#x27;s editing, since sound effects could now be used to inform the narrative. The film was one of the first to use a &quot;leitmotif&quot;, a technique borrowed from opera; it associates a melody with Lorre&#x27;s character, who whistles &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; from Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;. Later in the film, the mere sound of the song lets the audience know that he is nearby. This association of a musical theme with a particular character or situation is now a film staple. As Lorre could not whistle, Lang himself dubbed Beckert&#x27;s whistling.

==Release==
&quot;M&quot; premiered on 11 May 1931 at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo in Berlin, in a version lasting 117 minutes. The original negative is preserved at the Federal Film Archive in a 96-minute version. In 1960, an edited 98-minute version was released. The film was restored in 2000 by the Netherlands Film Museum in collaboration with the Federal Film Archive, the Cinemateque Suisse, Kirsch Media and ZDF/ARTE., with Janus Films releasing the 109-minute version as part of its Criterion Collection using prints from the Cinemateque Suisse and the Netherlands Film Museum. A complete print of the English version and selected scenes from the French version were included in the 2010 Criterion Collection release of the film.

The film was released in the United States in April 1933 by Foremco Pictures. After playing in German with English subtitles for two weeks, it was pulled from theaters and replaced by an English-language version. The re-dubbing was directed by Eric Hakim, and Lorre was one of the few cast members to reprise his role in the film. As with many other early talkies from the years 1930–1931, &quot;M&quot; was partially reshot with actors (including Lorre) performing dialogue in other languages for foreign markets after the German original was completed, apparently without Lang&#x27;s involvement. An English-language version was filmed and released in 1932 from an edited script with Lorre speaking his own words, his first English part. An edited French version was also released but despite the fact that Lorre spoke French his speaking parts were dubbed. In 2013, a DCP version was released by Kino Lorber and played theatrically in North America in the original aspect ratio of 1.19:1. Critic Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called this the &quot;most-complete-ever version&quot; at 111 minutes. The film was restored by TLEFilms Film Restoration &amp; Preservation Services (Berlin) in association with Archives françaises du film – CNC (Paris) and PostFactory GmbH (Berlin).

==Critical reception==

===Initial response===
A &quot;Variety&quot; review said that the film was &quot;a little too long. Without spoiling the effect—even bettering it—cutting could be done. There are a few repetitions and a few slow scenes.&quot; Graham Greene compared the film to &quot;looking through the eye-piece of a microscope, through which the tangled mind is exposed, laid flat on the slide: love and lust; nobility and perversity, hatred of itself and despair jumping at you from the jelly&quot;.

===Reassessment===
In later years, the film received widespread critical praise and holds an approval rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 9.30/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;A landmark psychological thriller with arresting images, deep thoughts on modern society, and Peter Lorre in his finest performance.&quot;

Marc Savlov of &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; awarded the film five out of five stars, calling it, &quot;One of the greatest of all German Expressionistic films&quot;. Savlov praised the film&#x27;s cinematography, the use of sound and Lorre&#x27;s performance. In 1997, critic Roger Ebert added &quot;M&quot; to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list. He proposed Lang&#x27;s limited use of dialogue was a critical factor in the film&#x27;s success, in contrast with many early sound films which &quot;felt they had to talk all the time&quot;. Ebert also argued the film&#x27;s characters, nearly all grotesques, embodied Lang&#x27;s distaste for his adopted homeland: &quot;What I sense is that Lang hated the people around him, hated Nazism, and hated Germany for permitting it.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Lang considered &quot;M&quot; to be his favorite of his own films because of the social criticism in the film. In 1937, he told a reporter that he made the film &quot;to warn mothers about neglecting children&quot;. The film has appeared on multiple lists as one of the greatest films ever made. It was voted the best German film of all time with 306 votes in a 1994 poll of 324 film journalists, film critics, filmmakers, and cineastes organized by the . It is included in &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s 100 Best Films of World Cinema in 2010. It is listed in the film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;, which says: &quot;Establishing conventions still being used by serial killer movies, Lang and scenarist Thea von Harbou intercut the pathetic life of the murderer with the frenzy of the police investigation into the outrageous crimes, and pay attention to issues of press coverage of the killings, vigilante action, and the political pressure that comes down from the politicians and hinders as much as encourages the police.&quot; In 2018, it was voted the thirteenth greatest foreign-language film of all time in BBC&#x27;s poll of 209 critics in 43 countries. The film is also referenced in the song &quot;In Germany Before the War&quot; by American songwriter Randy Newman in his 1977 album &quot;Little Criminals&quot;.

A scene from the movie was used in the 1940 Nazi propaganda movie &quot;The Eternal Jew&quot;.

===Remakes and adaptations===
A Hollywood remake of the same title was released in 1951, shifting the action from Berlin to Los Angeles. Nero Films head Seymour Nebenzal and his son Harold produced the film for Columbia Pictures. Lang had once told a reporter: &quot;People ask me why I do not remake &quot;M&quot; in English. I have no reason to do that. I said all I had to say about that subject in the picture. Now, I have other things to say.&quot; The remake was directed by Joseph Losey and starred David Wayne in Lorre&#x27;s role. Losey stated that he had seen &quot;M&quot; in the early 1930s and watched it again shortly before shooting the remake, but that he &quot;never referred to it. I only consciously repeated one shot. There may have been unconscious repetitions in terms of the atmosphere, of certain sequences.&quot; Lang later said that when the remake was released, he &quot;had the best reviews of [his] life&quot;.

Argentine noir classic &quot;El Vampiro Negro&quot;, released in 1953 and directed by Román Viñoly Barreto, is based on Lang&#x27;s original script. 

In 2003, &quot;M&quot; was adapted for radio by Peter Straughan and broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 2 February, later re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 8 October 2016. Directed by Toby Swift, this drama won the Prix Italia for Adapted Drama in 2004.

Writer Jon J. Muth adapted the screenplay into a four-part comic book series in 1990, which was reissued as a graphic novel in 2008.

In 2015, Joseph D. Kucan adapted the screenplay into a theatrical stageplay entitled &quot;A Summons from the Tinker to Assemble the Membership in Secret at the Usual Place&quot; for production by the Las Vegas-based theatre company A Public Fit. The play is environmental in nature, transforming its audience into the members of the criminal underground who have captured - and will judge - the elusive serial child murderer. The play is primarily a courtroom drama, presented with no fourth wall, and utilizes flashback sequences to tell the story of the man&#x27;s detection, capture and confession. A brief segment of the play is dedicated to improvised audience debate and deliberation.

In 2019, a six-episode Austrian-German miniseries adaptation of the film was released, entitled &quot;M — A City Hunts a Murderer&quot;.

<text>Crime Traveller is a 1997 British television science fiction detective series produced by Carnival Films for the BBC. It was based on the premise of using time travel for the purpose of solving crimes.

Anthony Horowitz created the series and wrote every episode. He had the idea while writing an episode of &quot;Poirot&quot;. Despite having over eight million viewers on a regular basis, &quot;Crime Traveller&quot; was not renewed after its first series. According to Horowitz, &quot;The show wasn&#x27;t exactly cut. There was a chasm at the BBC, created by the arrival of a new Head of Drama and our run ended at that time. There was no-one around to commission a new series...and so it just didn&#x27;t happen.&quot;

==Plot==
Jeff Slade is a detective with the Criminal Investigation Department of the local police force led by Kate Grisham; although unusually for such a position he is an armed officer, carrying a handgun as routine. Slade is a good detective who gets results although his approach is somewhat maverick and his methods do leave a lot to be desired and have more than once landed him in trouble. Amongst Slade&#x27;s colleagues at the department is science officer Holly Turner who has a secret that Slade manages to uncover. Holly owns a working time machine that was built by her late father. The machine is able to take Slade and Holly back far enough in time to witness a crime as it happens and discover who committed it. As a result, Slade&#x27;s track record with crime solving goes through the roof with case after case being solved in record time.

==Cast==
* Michael French as DI Jeff Slade — City detective, and the only person other than Holly who knows about the time machine.
* Chloë Annett as Holly Turner — Forensic scientist whose father invented the time machine, which she keeps and adjusts in her apartment.
* Sue Johnston as DCI Kate Grisham — Slade&#x27;s irritable boss whom, thanks to his methods, he is constantly getting on the wrong side of.
* Paul Trussell as DS Morris — Slade&#x27;s slow-witted colleague, who usually takes the credit for his success.
* Richard Dempsey as DC Nicky Robson — A posh, intelligent but naïve trainee detective, too helpful and trusting for his own good.
* Bob Goody as Danny — Caretaker at Holly&#x27;s apartment block, who is constantly having to deal with the power outages caused by Holly and Slade&#x27;s use of the time machine.

<text>Brașov (, , ; ; ; ; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Kruhnen&quot;) is a city in Transylvania, Romania and the county seat (i.e. administrative centre) of Brașov County.

According to the 2021 census, with 237,589 inhabitants, Brașov is the 6th most populous city in Romania. The metropolitan area was home to 371,802 residents.

Brașov is located in the central part of the country, about north of Bucharest and from the Black Sea. It is surrounded by the Southern Carpathians and is part of the historical region of Transylvania.

Historically, the city was the centre of the Burzenland (), once dominated by the Transylvanian Saxons (), and a significant commercial hub on the trade roads between Austria (then Archduchy of Austria, within the Habsburg monarchy, and subsequently Austrian Empire) and Turkey (then Ottoman Empire). It is also where the national anthem of Romania was first sung.

==Names==
===Brassovia, Brassó, Brașov, etc.===
According to Dragoș Moldovanu, the name of Brașov came from the name of local river named Bârsa (also pronounced as &quot;Bărsa&quot;) that was adopted by Slavs and transformed to Barsa, and later to Barsov, finally to Brasov. According to Pál Binder, the current Romanian and the Hungarian name () are derived from the Turkic word &quot;barasu&quot;, meaning &quot;white water&quot; with a Slavic suffix &quot;-ov&quot;. Other linguists proposed various etymologies including an Old Slavic anthroponym Brasa. The first attested mention of this name is &quot;Terra Saxonum de Barasu&quot; (&quot;Saxon Land of Baras&quot;) in a 1252 document issued by Béla IV of Hungary. According to some historians, &quot;Corona&quot; was name of the city-fortress while &quot;Brassó&quot; was referring to the county, while others consider both names may refer to the city and the county as well.

===Corona, Kronstadt===
According to Balázs Orbán, the name &quot;Corona&quot;a Latin word meaning &quot;crown&quot; – is first mentioned in the Catalogus Ninivensis in 1235 AD, stating a monastic quarter existed in the territory of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania (&quot;In Hungaria assignata est paternitas Dyocesis Cumanie: Corona&quot;). Pál Binder supposed it is a reference to the St. Catherine&#x27;s Monastery. Others suggest the name derives from the old coat of arms of the city, as it is symbolized by the German name &quot;Kronstadt&quot; meaning &quot;Crown City&quot;. The two names of the city, &quot;Kronstadt&quot; and &quot;Corona&quot;, were used simultaneously in the Middle Ages, along with the Medieval Latin &quot;Brassovia&quot;.

===Stephanopolis, Orașul Stalin===

Another historical name used for Brașov is &quot;Stephanopolis&quot;, from &quot;Stephanos&quot;, crown, and &quot;polis&quot;, city.

On 22 August 1950, Brașov was renamed &quot;Orașul Stalin&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; Stalin City) after Joseph Stalin. Constantin Ion Parhon, the nominal Head of State at the time, decreed the city be renamed &quot;in honour of the great genius of working humanity, the leader of the Soviet people, the liberator and beloved friend of our people, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin&quot;. The city&#x27;s name reverted to Brașov in 1960.

==History==
The oldest traces of human activity and settlements in Brașov date back to the Neolithic age (about 9500 BCE). Archaeologists working from the last half of the 19th century discovered continuous traces of human settlements in areas situated in Brașov: Valea Cetății, Pietrele lui Solomon, Șprenghi, Tâmpa, Dealul Melcilor, and Noua. The first three locations show traces of Dacian citadels; Șprenghi Hill housed a Roman-style construction. The last two locations had their names applied to Bronze Age cultures — Schneckenberg (&quot;Hill of the Snails&quot;; Early Bronze Age) and &quot;Noua&quot; (&quot;The New&quot;; Late Bronze Age).

Transylvanian Saxons played a decisive role in Brașov&#x27;s development and were invited by Hungarian kings to develop towns, build mines, and cultivate the land of Transylvania at different stages between 1141 and 1300. The settlers came primarily from the Rhineland, Flanders, and the Moselle region, with others from Thuringia, Bavaria, Wallonia, and even France.

In 1211, by order of King Andrew II of Hungary, the Teutonic Knights fortified the Burzenland to defend the border of the Kingdom of Hungary. On the site of the village of Brașov, the Teutonic Knights built Kronstadt – &#x27;the City of the Crown&#x27;. Although the crusaders were evicted by 1225, the colonists they brought in long ago remained, along with local population in three distinct settlements they founded on the site of Brașov:
*&quot;Corona&quot;, around the Black Church (Biserica Neagră);
*&quot;Martinsberg&quot;, west of Cetățuia Hill;
*&quot;Bartholomä&quot;, on the eastern side of Sprenghi Hill.

Germans living in Brașov were mainly involved in trade and crafts. The location of the city at the intersection of trade routes linking the Ottoman Empire and Western Europe, together with certain tax exemptions, allowed Saxon merchants to obtain considerable wealth and exert a strong political influence. They contributed a great deal to the architectural flavour of the city. Fortifications around the city were erected and continually expanded, with several towers maintained by different craftsmen&#x27;s guilds, according to the medieval custom. Part of the fortification ensemble was recently restored using UNESCO funds, and other projects are ongoing. At least two entrances to the city, &quot;Poarta Ecaterinei&quot; (or &quot;Katharinentor&quot;) and &quot;Poarta Șchei&quot; (or &quot;Waisenhausgässertor&quot;), are still in existence. The city centre is marked by the mayor&#x27;s former office building (Casa Sfatului) and the surrounding square (&quot;piața&quot;), which includes one of the oldest buildings in Brașov, the Hirscher Haus. Nearby is the &quot;Black Church&quot; (&quot;Biserica Neagră&quot;), which some claim to be the largest Gothic style church in Southeastern Europe.

In 1689, a great fire destroyed the walled city almost entirely, and its rebuilding lasted several decades.

Besides the German (Saxon) population living in the walled city and in the northern suburbs, Brașov had also a significant Romanian and Bulgarian population (living in the Șchei district), and also some Hungarian population (living in the Blumăna district). The cultural and religious importance of the Romanian church and school in Șchei is underlined by the generous donations received from more than thirty hospodars of Moldavia and Wallachia, as well as that from Elizabeth of Russia. In the 17th and 19th centuries, the Romanians in Șchei campaigned for national, political, and cultural rights, and were supported in their efforts by Romanians from all other provinces, as well as by the local Greek merchant community. In 1838, they established the first Romanian language newspaper &quot;Gazeta Transilvaniei&quot; and the first Romanian institutions of higher education: &quot;Școlile Centrale Greco-Ortodoxe&quot; (&quot;The Greek-Orthodox Central Schools&quot;, today named after Andrei Șaguna). The Holy Roman Emperor and sovereign of Transylvania Joseph II awarded Romanians citizenship rights for a brief period during the latter decades of the 18th century.

In 1850, the town had 21,782 inhabitants: 8,874 (40.7%) Germans, 8,727 (40%) Romanians, 2,939 (13.4%) Hungarians. In 1910 there were 41,056 inhabitants: 17,831 (43.4%) Hungarians, 11,786 (28.7%) Romanians, 10,841 (26.4%) Germans.

On 29 August 1916, during the First World War, the Romanian Army occupied Brașov. Romanian troops entered the city at around five o&#x27;clock p.m. and paraded towards the city square. Romanian rule over the city lasted until early October, when the area was retaken by the Central Powers in the Battle of Brassó (7-9 October 1916). The Romanian mayor installed during the brief Romanian occupation was Gheorghe Baiulescu. His term lasted from 29 August, when the city was occupied by the Romanian Army, until 8 October – the height of the Battle of Brașov. On 9 October, at the end of the battle, the previous mayor Karl Ernst Schnell was reinstated.
Following the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the 1 December 1918 Proclamation of the Union of Alba Iulia, adopted by deputies of the Romanians from Transylvania, Banat, Crișana and Maramureș during the Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia declared the union of Transylvania into the Romanian state. Brașov was permanently occupied by Romanian forces on 7 December, as Hungarians gradually withdrew northwards. The King and some Transylvanians suggested that - because of Brașov&#x27;s central geographical location in the new Romania - it should be considered as the new national capital. Though this did not happen - the inter-war period was a time of flourishing economy and cultural life in general, including the Saxons in Brașov. However, at the end of World War II many ethnic Germans were forcibly deported to the Soviet Union. A majority of them emigrated to West Germany after Romania had become a communist country.

The first Jewish community in Brașov was established in 1828, joining the Neolog association in 1868. Orthodox Jews founded their religious organization in 1877. The Neolog synagogue, seating 800, was built between 1899 and 1905. During the interwar period, the communities had separate institutions, but opened a jointly managed school in 1940. Zionist organizations appeared already in 1920. By 1930, Jews numbered 2594 individuals, or 4% of the total population. In autumn 1940, during the National Legionary State, the antisemitic Iron Guard nationalized all Jewish institutions and seized most shops owned by Jews. In 1941, Jews were drafted for service in forced labour battalions. Those from throughout southern Transylvania were concentrated in Brașov; a further 200 refugees came from Ploiești. In August 1942, 850 Jews between the ages of 18 and 50 were drafted into labour battalions and ordered to work in Brașov, while others were sent to Predeal and Bran. In spring 1943, 250 youths were sent to Suraia camp to build fortifications. By August 1944, the labour battalions were reduced to 250-300 while most of the Jews managed to obtain their freedom. In 1945–1946, the Jewish population increased to 3500.

Like many other cities in Transylvania, Brașov is also home to a significant ethnic Hungarian minority.

During the communist period, industrial development was vastly accelerated. Under Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s rule, the city was the site of the 1987 Brașov strike. This was brutally repressed by the authorities and resulted in numerous workers being imprisoned.

== Economy ==

Industrial development in Brașov started in the inter-war period, with one of the largest factories being the aeroplane manufacturing plant (IAR Brașov), which produced the first Romanian fighter planes used during World War II. After signing the armistice with USSR on September 12, 1944, the factory started repairing trucks, and in October 1945 it began manufacturing agricultural tractors. IAR 22 was the first Romanian-made wheeled tractor. In 1948 the company was renamed Uzina Tractorul Brașov known internationally as Universal Tractor Brașov.
A big part of the factory was demolished during 2013 and 2014 giving way to buildings, shopping mall and recreation parks. Aircraft manufacturing resumed in 1968 at first under the name ICA and then under its old name of IAR at a new location in nearby Ghimbav.

Industrialization was accelerated in the Communist era, with special emphasis being placed on heavy industry, attracting many workers from other parts of the country. Heavy industry is still abundant, including Roman, which manufactures MAN AG trucks as well as native-designed trucks and coaches. Although the industrial base has been in decline in recent years, Brașov is still a site for manufacturing hydraulic transmissions, auto parts, ball-bearings, construction materials, hand tools, furniture, textiles and shoe-wear. There is also a large brewery.

<text>The Battle of Điện Biên Phủ was a climactic confrontation of the First Indochina War that took place between 13 March and 7 May 1954. It was fought between the forces of the French Union and Viet Minh.

The French began an operation to insert, and support, their soldiers at Điện Biên Phủ, deep in the autonomous Tai Federation in northwest Tonkin. The operation&#x27;s purpose was to cut off enemy supply lines into the neighboring Kingdom of Laos (a French ally) and draw the Viet Minh into a major confrontation in order to cripple them. The French based their forces in an isolated but well-fortified camp that would be resupplied by air, a strategy adopted based on the belief that the Viet Minh had no anti-aircraft capability.

The Viet Minh, however, under General Võ Nguyên Giáp, surrounded and besieged the French. They brought in vast amounts of heavy artillery (including anti-aircraft guns) and managed to move these bulky weapons through difficult terrain up the rear slopes of the mountains. They dug tunnels and arranged the guns to target the French positions. The tunnels featured a front terrace, onto which the Viet Minh would pull their cannons from out of the tunnels, fire a few shots, to then pull them back into protective cover. In 54 days of gun battle, no Viet Minh cannon was destroyed.

In March, the Viet Minh began a massive artillery bombardment of the French defenses. The strategic positioning of their artillery made it nearly impervious to French counter-battery fire. Tenacious fighting on the ground ensued, reminiscent of the trench warfare of World War I. At times, the French repulsed Viet Minh assaults on their positions while supplies and reinforcements were delivered by air. As key positions were overrun, the perimeter contracted, and the air resupply on which the French had placed their hopes became impossible as aircraft were shot down and runways were destroyed.

The garrison was overrun in May after a two-month siege, and most of the French forces surrendered. A few men escaped to Laos. Among the 11,721 French troops captured, 858 of the most seriously wounded were evacuated via the Red Cross mediation in May 1954. Only 3,290 were returned four months later, although it is believed that a small fraction of the outstanding missing troops were Vietnamese who had not yet been returned by the French, and did not necessarily die in captivity; adjusting for this, the death rate of French troops in captivity of the Viet Minh is estimated to be approximately 60%. The French government in Paris resigned. The new prime minister, the left-of-centre Pierre Mendès France, supported French withdrawal from Indochina.

The Battle of Điện Biên Phủ was decisive. The war ended shortly afterward and the 1954 Geneva Accords were signed. France agreed to withdraw its forces from all its colonies in French Indochina, while stipulating that Vietnam would be temporarily divided at the 17th parallel, with control of the north given to the Viet Minh as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh. With huge support by the U.S., the south became the State of Vietnam, nominally under Emperor Bảo Đại, preventing Ho Chi Minh from gaining control of the entire country.

== Background ==
=== Military situation ===
By 1953, the First Indochina War was not going well for France. A succession of commanders – Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, Jean Étienne Valluy, Roger Blaizot, Marcel Carpentier, Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and Raoul Salan – had proven incapable of suppressing the insurrection of the Viet Minh, who were fighting for independence. During their 1952–1953 campaign, the Viet Minh had overrun vast swathes of Laos, Vietnam&#x27;s western neighbor, advancing as far as Luang Prabang and the Plain of Jars. The French were unable to slow the advance of the Viet Minh, who fell back only after outrunning their always-tenuous supply lines. In 1953, the French had begun to strengthen their defenses in the Hanoi delta region to prepare for a series of offensives against Viet Minh staging areas in northwest Vietnam. They set up fortified towns and outposts in the area, including Lai Châu near the Chinese border to the north, Nà Sản to the west of Hanoi, and the Plain of Jars in northern Laos.

In May 1953, French Premier René Mayer named Henri Navarre as Salan&#x27;s successor to command French Union forces in Indochina. Mayer had given Navarre a single order—to create military conditions that would lead to an &quot;honorable political solution&quot;. According to military scholar Phillip Davidson:
 On arrival, Navarre was shocked by what he found. There had been no long-range plan since de Lattre&#x27;s departure. Everything was conducted on a day-to-day, reactive basis. Combat operations were undertaken only in response to enemy moves or threats. There was no comprehensive plan to develop the organization and build up the equipment of the Expeditionary force. Finally, Navarre, the intellectual, the cold and professional soldier, was shocked by the &quot;school&#x27;s out&quot; attitude of Salan and his senior commanders and staff officers. They were going home, not as victors or heroes, but then, not as clear losers either. To them the important thing was that they were getting out of Indochina with their reputations frayed, but intact. They spared little thought or concern for the problems of their successors.

=== Nà Sản and the hedgehog concept ===

Navarre began searching for a way to address the Viet Minh threat to Laos. Colonel Louis Berteil, commander of Mobile Group 7 and Navarre&#x27;s main strategist, formulated the &quot;hérisson&quot; (&#x27;hedgehog&#x27;) concept. The French army would establish a fortified airhead by airlifting soldiers to positions adjacent to key Viet Minh supply lines to Laos. They would cut off Viet Minh soldiers fighting in Laos and force them to withdraw. &quot;It was an attempt to interdict the enemy&#x27;s rear area, to stop the flow of supplies and reinforcements, to establish a redoubt in the enemy&#x27;s rear and disrupt his lines&quot;.

The &quot;hérisson&quot; was based on French experiences at the Battle of Nà Sản. In late November and early December 1952, Giáp had attacked the French outpost at Nà Sản, which was essentially an &quot;air-land base&quot;, a fortified camp supplied only by air. There, the French beat back Giáp&#x27;s forces repeatedly, inflicting very heavy losses on them. The French hoped that by repeating the strategy on a much larger scale, they would be able to lure Giáp into committing the bulk of his forces to a massed assault. This would enable superior French artillery, armor, and air support to decimate the exposed Viet Minh forces. The success at Nà Sản convinced Navarre of the viability of the fortified airhead concept.

However, French staff officers failed to treat seriously several crucial differences between Điện Biên Phủ and Nà Sản:
First, at Nà Sản, the French commanded most of the high ground with overwhelming artillery support. At Điện Biên Phủ, however, the Viet Minh controlled much of the high ground around the valley, their artillery far exceeded French expectations, and they outnumbered the French troops four to one. Giáp compared Điện Biên Phủ to a &quot;rice bowl&quot;, where his troops occupied the edge and the French the bottom. Second, Giáp made a mistake at Nà Sản by committing his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared. He learned his lesson: at Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns before making his move. He obtained crucial intelligence on French artillery positions from Viet Minh spies posing as camp laborers. Artillery pieces were sited within well-constructed and camouflaged casemates. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not even know how many guns Giáp possessed. Third, the aerial resupply lines at Nà Sản were never severed, despite Viet Minh anti-aircraft fire. At Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp made it a priority for his gunners to focus on the French runways and aircraft, crippling supply runs and making it impossible for fresh soldiers to be sent in.

== Prelude ==

=== Lead up to Castor ===
In June 1953, Major General René Cogny, the French commander in the Tonkin Delta, proposed Điện Biên Phủ, which had an old airstrip built by the Japanese during World War II, as a &quot;mooring point&quot;. In another misunderstanding, Cogny envisioned a lightly defended point from which to launch raids; Navarre, however, believed that he intended to build a heavily fortified base capable of withstanding a siege. Navarre selected Điện Biên Phủ for Berteil&#x27;s &quot;hedgehog&quot; operation. When presented with the plan, every major subordinate officer – Colonel Jean-Louis Nicot (commander of the French Air transport fleet), Cogny, and Generals Jean Gilles and Jean Dechaux (the ground and air commanders for &quot;Operation Castor&quot;, the initial airborne assault on Điện Biên Phủ) – protested. Cogny pointed out, presciently, that &quot;we are running the risk of a new Nà Sản under worse conditions&quot;. Navarre rejected the criticisms of his proposal and concluded a 17 November conference by declaring that the operation would begin three days later, on 20 November 1953.

Navarre decided to go ahead with the plan despite serious operational difficulties. These later became painfully obvious, but at the time may have been less apparent. He had been repeatedly assured by his intelligence officers that the operation carried very little risk of involvement by a strong enemy force. Navarre had previously considered three other approaches to defending Laos: mobile warfare, which was impossible given the terrain in Vietnam; a static defense line stretching to Laos, which was not feasible given the number of troops at Navarre&#x27;s disposal; or placing troops in the Laotian provincial capitals and supplying them by air, which was unworkable due to the distance from Hanoi to Luang Prabang and Vientiane. Navarre believed that this left only the hedgehog option, which he characterized as &quot;a mediocre solution&quot;. The French National Defense Committee ultimately agreed that Navarre&#x27;s responsibility did not include defending Laos. However, its decision, which was drawn up on 13 November, was not delivered to him until 4 December, two weeks after the Điện Biên Phủ operation began.

=== Establishment of air operations ===

Operations at Điện Biên Phủ began at 10:35 on 20 November 1953. In &quot;Operation Castor&quot;, the French dropped or flew 9,000 troops into the area over three days, as well as a bulldozer to prepare the airstrip. They were landed at three drop zones: &quot;Natasha&quot; (northwest of Điện Biên Phủ), &quot;Octavie&quot; (to the southwest), and &quot;Simone&quot; (to the southeast). The Viet Minh elite 148th Independent Infantry Regiment, headquartered at Điện Biên Phủ, reacted &quot;instantly and effectively&quot;. Three of its four battalions, however, were absent. Initial operations proceeded well for the French. By the end of November, six parachute battalions had been landed, and the French Army consolidated its positions.

It was at this time that Giáp began his countermoves. He had expected an attack but had not foreseen when or where it would occur. Giáp realized that, if pressed, the French would abandon Lai Châu Province and fight a pitched battle at Điện Biên Phủ. On 24 November, Giáp ordered the 148th Infantry Regiment and the 316th Division to attack Lai Chau, while the 308th, 312th, and 351st divisions assaulted Điện Biên Phủ from &quot;Việt Bắc&quot;.

Starting in December, the French, under the command of Colonel Christian de Castries, began transforming their anchoring point into a fortress by setting up seven satellite positions. (Each was said to be named after a former mistress of de Castries, although the allegation is probably unfounded, as the eight names begin with letters from the first nine of the alphabet.) The fortified headquarters was centrally located, with positions &quot;Huguette&quot; to the west, &quot;Claudine&quot; to the south, and &quot;Dominique&quot; to the northeast. The other positions were &quot;Anne-Marie&quot; to the northwest, &quot;Beatrice&quot; to the northeast, &quot;Gabrielle&quot; to the north, and &quot;Isabelle&quot; to the south, covering the reserve airstrip.

The arrival of the 316th Viet Minh Division prompted Cogny to order the evacuation of the Lai Chau garrison to Điện Biên Phủ, exactly as Giáp had anticipated. En route, they were virtually annihilated by the Viet Minh. &quot;Of the 2,100 men who left Lai Chau on 9 December, only 185 made it to Điện Biên Phủ on 22 December. The rest had been killed, captured, or &quot;deserted&quot;.

French military forces had committed 10,800 troops, together with yet more reinforcements, totalling nearly 16,000 men, to the defense of a monsoon-affected valley surrounded by heavily-wooded hills and high ground that had not been secured. Artillery as well as ten US M24 Chaffee light tanks (each broken down into 180 individual parts, flown into the base, and then re-assembled) and numerous aircraft (attack and supply types) were committed to the garrison. A number of quadruple 0.50 calibre machine guns were present and used in the ground role. This included France&#x27;s regular troops (notably elite paratrooper units, plus those of the artillery), French Foreign Legionnaires, Algerian and Moroccan tirailleurs (colonial troops from North Africa) and locally-recruited Indochinese (Laotian, Vietnamese and Cambodian) infantry.

In comparison, altogether the Viet Minh had moved up to 50,000 regular troops into the hills surrounding the French-held valley, totalling five divisions, including the 351st Heavy Division, which was an artillery formation equipped with medium artillery, such as the US M101 105mm howitzer, supplied by the neighbouring People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) from captured stocks obtained from defeated Nationalist China as well as US forces in Korea, together with some heavier field-guns as well as anti-aircraft artillery. Various types of artillery and anti-aircraft guns (mainly of Soviet origin), which outnumbered their French counterparts by about four to one, were moved into strategic positions overlooking the valley and the French forces based there. The French garrison came under sporadic direct artillery fire from the Viet Minh for the first time on 31 January 1954 and patrols encountered the Viet Minh troops in all directions around them. The French were completely surrounded.

=== Giáp&#x27;s change of strategy ===
Originally, the planned Viet Minh attack was based on the Chinese &quot;Fast Strike, Fast Victory&quot; model, which aimed to use all available power to thrust into the command center of the base to secure victory, but this was changed to the &quot;Steady Fight, Steady Advance&quot; model of siege tactics.

The battle plan designed on the fast strike model was due to open at 17:00 on 25 January and to finish three nights and two days later. Nevertheless this start date was delayed to 26 January, because on 21 January Viet Minh&#x27;s intelligence indicated that the French had grasped this plan.

After much debate, due to the French knowledge of the battle plan and along with other complications, the assault was canceled on 26 January, and Giáp went away and designed a new plan with a new start time. He said that this change of plan was the hardest decision of his military career.

==Battle==

===Béatrice===
The Viet Minh assault began in earnest on 13 March 1954 with an attack on the northeastern outpost, &quot;Béatrice&quot;, which was held by the 3rd Battalion, 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade. Viet Minh artillery opened a fierce bombardment with two batteries each of 105mm howitzers, 120mm mortars, and 75mm mountain guns (plus seventeen 57mm recoilless rifles and numerous 60mm and 81/82mm mortars). French command was disrupted at 18:30 when a shell hit the French command post, killing the battalion commander, Major Paul Pégot, and most of his staff. A few minutes later, Lieutenant Colonel Jules Gaucher, commander of the entire central subsector, was also killed by artillery fire. The Viet Minh 312th Division then launched an assault with its 141st and 209th Infantry Regiments, using sappers to breach the French obstacles.

&quot;Béatrice&quot; comprised three separate strong points forming a triangle with the point facing north. In the southeast, strong point &quot;Beatrice&quot;-3, its defenses smashed by 75mm mountain guns firing at point-blank range, was quickly overrun by the 209th Regiment&#x27;s 130th Battalion. In the north, most of &quot;Beatrice&quot;-1 was swiftly conquered by the 141st Regiment&#x27;s 428th Battalion, but the defenders held out in corner of the position for a time because the attackers thought they had captured the entire strong point when they encountered an internal barbed wire barrier in the dark. In the southwest, the assault on &quot;Beatrice&quot;-2 by the 141st Regiment&#x27;s 11th Battalion did not fare well because its assault trenches were too shallow and portions of them had been flattened by French artillery. Its efforts to breach &quot;Beatrice&quot;-2&#x27;s barbed wire were stalled for hours by flanking fire from &quot;Beatrice&quot;-1 and several previously-undetected bunkers on &quot;Beatrice&quot;-2 that had been spared by the bombardment. The holdouts on &quot;Beatrice&quot;-1 were eliminated by 22:30, and the 141st Regiment&#x27;s 11th and 16th Battalions finally broke into &quot;Beatrice&quot;-2 an hour later, though the strong point was not entirely taken until after 01:00 on 14 March. Roughly 350 French legionnaires were killed, wounded, or captured. About 100 managed to escape and rejoin the French lines. The French estimated that Viet Minh losses totaled 600 dead and 1,200 wounded. According to the Viet Minh, they lost 193 killed and 137 wounded The victory at &quot;Beatrice&quot; &quot;galvanized the morale&quot; of the Viet Minh troops.

Much to French disbelief, the Viet Minh had employed direct artillery fire, in which each gun crew does its own artillery spotting (as opposed to indirect fire, in which guns are massed further away from the target, out of direct line of sight, and rely on a forward artillery spotter). Indirect artillery, generally held as being far superior to direct fire, requires experienced, well-trained crews and good communications, which the Viet Minh lacked. Navarre wrote that, &quot;Under the influence of Chinese advisers, the Viet Minh commanders had used processes quite different from the classic methods. The artillery had been dug in by single pieces...They were installed in shellproof dugouts, and fire point-blank from portholes... This way of using artillery and AA guns was possible only with the expansive ant holes at the disposal of the Viet Minh and was to make shambles of all the estimates of our own artillerymen.&quot; Two days later, the French artillery commander, Colonel Charles Piroth, distraught at his inability to silence the well-camouflaged Viet Minh batteries, went into his dugout and committed suicide with a grenade. He was buried there in secret to prevent loss of morale among the French troops.

=== &quot;Gabrielle&quot; ===
Following a five-hour ceasefire on the morning of 14 March, Viet Minh artillery resumed pounding French positions. The airstrip, already closed since 16:00 the day before due to a light bombardment, was now put permanently out of commission. Any further French supplies would have to be delivered by parachute. That night, the Viet Minh launched an attack on the northern outpost &quot;Gabrielle&quot;, held by an elite Algerian battalion. The attack began with a concentrated artillery barrage at 17:00. This was very effective and stunned the defenders. Two regiments from the crack 308th Division attacked starting at 20:00. At 04:00 the following morning, an artillery shell hit the battalion headquarters, severely wounding the battalion commander and most of his staff.

De Castries ordered a counterattack to relieve &quot;Gabrielle&quot;. However, Colonel Pierre Langlais, in forming the counterattack, chose to rely on the 5th Vietnamese Parachute Battalion, which had jumped in the day before and was exhausted. Although some elements of the counterattack reached &quot;Gabrielle&quot;, most were paralyzed by Viet Minh artillery and took heavy losses. At 08:00 the next day, the Algerian battalion fell back, abandoning &quot;Gabrielle&quot; to the Viet Minh. The French lost around 1,000 men defending &quot;Gabrielle&quot;, and the Viet Minh between 1,000 and 2,000 attacking the strongpoint.

=== &quot;Anne-Marie&quot; ===
The northwestern outpost &quot;Anne-Marie&quot; was defended by Tai troops, members of an ethnic minority loyal to the French. For weeks, Giáp had distributed subversive propaganda leaflets, telling the Tais that this was not their fight. The fall of &quot;Beatrice&quot; and &quot;Gabrielle&quot; had demoralized them. On the morning of 17 March, under the cover of fog, the bulk of the Tais left or defected. The French and the few remaining Tais on &quot;Anne-Marie&quot; were then forced to withdraw.

=== Lull ===
A lull in fighting occurred from March 17 to March 30. The Viet Minh further encircled the French central area (formed by the strong points &quot;Huguette&quot;, &quot;Dominique&quot;, &quot;Claudine&quot;, and &quot;Eliane&quot;), effectively cutting off &quot;Isabelle&quot; and its 1,809 personnel to the south. During this lull, the French suffered from a serious crisis of command. Senior officers with the garrison and Cogny in Hanoi began to feel that de Castries was incompetent in defending Dien Bien Phu. After the loss of the northern outposts, he isolated himself in his bunker, &quot;de facto&quot; shirking his command of the situation. On 17 March, Cogny attempted to fly into Điện Biên Phủ to take command, but his plane was driven off by anti-aircraft fire. He considered parachuting into the encircled garrison, but his staff talked him out of it.
De Castries&#x27; seclusion in his bunker, combined with his superiors&#x27; inability to replace him, created a leadership vacuum in the French command. On 24 March, an event took place which later became a matter of historical debate. The historian Bernard Fall records, based on Langlais&#x27; memoirs, that Langlais and his fellow paratroop commanders, all fully armed, confronted de Castries in his bunker on 24 March. They told him he would retain the appearance of command, but that Langlais would exercise it. De Castries is said by Fall to have accepted the arrangement without protest, although he did exercise some command functions thereafter. Phillip Davidson stated that the &quot;truth would seem to be that Langlais did take over effective command of Dien Bien Phu, and that Castries became &#x27;commander emeritus&#x27; who transmitted messages to Hanoi and offered advice about matters in Dien Bien Phu&quot;. Jules Roy, however, makes no mention of this event, and Martin Windrow argues that the &quot;paratrooper putsch&quot; is unlikely to have ever happened. Both historians record that Langlais and Marcel Bigeard were known to be on good terms with their commanding officer.

French aerial resupply took heavy losses from Viet Minh machine guns near the landing strip. On 27 March, the Hanoi air transport commander, Nicot, ordered that all supply deliveries be made from or higher; losses were expected to remain heavy. The following day, De Castries ordered an attack against the Viet Minh AA machine guns west of Điện Biên Phủ. Remarkably, the attack was a complete success, with 350 Viet Minh&#x27;s casualties and seventeen 12.7mm AA machine guns destroyed (French estimate), while the French lost 20 killed and 97 wounded.

=== 30 March – 5 April assaults ===

The next phase of the battle saw more massed Viet Minh assaults against French positions in central Điện Biên Phủ – particularly at &quot;Eliane&quot; and &quot;Dominique&quot;, the two remaining outposts east of the Nam Yum River. Those two areas were held by five understrength battalions, composed of Frenchmen, Legionnaires, Vietnamese, North Africans, and Tais. Giáp planned to use the tactics from the &quot;Beatrice&quot; and &quot;Gabrielle&quot; skirmishes.

At 19:00 on 30 March, the Viet Minh 312th Division captured &quot;Dominique&quot; 1 and 2, making &quot;Dominique&quot; 3 the final outpost between the Viet Minh and the French general headquarters, as well as outflanking all positions east of the river. At this point, the French 4th Colonial Artillery Regiment entered the fight, setting its 105 mm howitzers to zero elevation and firing directly on the Viet Minh attackers, blasting huge holes in their ranks. Another group of French soldiers, near the airfield, opened fire on the Viet Minh with anti-aircraft machine guns, forcing the Viet Minh to retreat.

The Viet Minh&#x27;s simultaneous attacks elsewhere were more successful. The 316th Division captured &quot;Eliane&quot; 1 from its Moroccan defenders, and half of &quot;Eliane&quot; 2 by midnight. On the west side of Điện Biên Phủ, the 308th attacked &quot;Huguette&quot; 7, and nearly succeeded in breaking through, but a French sergeant took charge of the defenders and sealed the breach.

Just after midnight on 31 March, the French launched a counterattack against &quot;Eliane&quot; 2, and recaptured it. Langlais ordered another counterattack the following afternoon against &quot;Dominique&quot; 2 and &quot;Eliane&quot; 1, using virtually &quot;everybody left in the garrison who could be trusted to fight&quot;. The counterattacks allowed the French to retake &quot;Dominique&quot; 2 and &quot;Eliane&quot; 1, but the Viet Minh launched their own renewed assault. The French, who were exhausted and without reserves, fell back from both positions late in the afternoon. Reinforcements were sent north from &quot;Isabelle&quot;, but were attacked en route and fell back to &quot;Isabelle&quot;.

Shortly after dark on 31 March, Langlais told Bigeard, who was leading the defense at &quot;Eliane&quot; 2, to fall back from &quot;Eliane&quot; 4. Bigeard refused, saying &quot;As long as I have one man alive I won&#x27;t let go of &quot;Eliane&quot; 4. Otherwise, Dien Bien Phu is done for.&quot; The night of 31 March, the 316th Division attacked &quot;Eliane&quot; 2. Just as it appeared the French were about to be overrun, a few French tanks arrived from the central garrison, and helped push the Viet Minh back. Smaller attacks on &quot;Eliane&quot; 4 were also pushed back. The Viet Minh briefly captured &quot;Huguette&quot; 7, only to be pushed back by a French counterattack at dawn on 1 April.

Fighting continued in this manner over the next several nights. The Viet Minh repeatedly attacked &quot;Eliane&quot; 2, only to be beaten back. Repeated attempts to reinforce the French garrison by parachute drops were made, but had to be carried out by lone planes at irregular times to avoid excessive casualties from Viet Minh anti-aircraft fire. Some reinforcements did arrive, but not enough to replace French casualties.

=== Trench warfare ===
On 5 April, after a long night of battle, French fighter-bombers and artillery inflicted particularly devastating losses on one Viet Minh regiment, which was caught on open ground. At that point, Giáp decided to change tactics. Although Giáp still had the same objective – to overrun French defenses east of the river – he decided to employ entrenchment and sapping to achieve it.

On 10 April, the French attempted to retake &quot;Eliane&quot; 1, which had been lost eleven days earlier. The loss posed a significant threat to &quot;Eliane&quot; 4, and the French wanted to eliminate that threat. The dawn attack, which Bigeard devised, began with a short, massive artillery barrage, followed by small unit infiltration attacks, then mopping-up operations. &quot;Eliane&quot; 1 changed hands several times that day, but by the next morning the French had control of the strong point. The Viet Minh attempted to retake it on the evening of 12 April, but were pushed back.

At this point, the morale of the Viet Minh soldiers was greatly lowered due to the massive casualties they had received from heavy French gunfire. During a period of stalemate from 15 April to 1 May, the French intercepted enemy radio messages which told of whole units refusing orders to attack, and Viet Minh prisoners in French hands said that they were told to advance or be shot by the officers and non-commissioned officers behind them. Worse still, the Viet Minh lacked advanced medical treatment and care, leading a US general commenting on the war to observe that &quot;Nothing strikes at combat-morale like the knowledge that if wounded, the soldier will go uncared for&quot;.

During the fighting at &quot;Eliane&quot; 1, on the other side of camp, the Viet Minh entrenchments had almost entirely surrounded &quot;Huguette&quot; 1 and 6. On 11 April the garrison of &quot;Huguette&quot; 1, supported by artillery from &quot;Claudine&quot;, launched an attack with the goal of resupplying &quot;Huguette&quot; 6 with water and ammunition. The attacks were repeated on the nights of the 14–15 and 16–17 April. While they did succeed in getting some supplies through, the French suffered heavy casualties, which convinced Langlais to abandon &quot;Huguette&quot; 6. Following a failed attempt to link up, on 18 April, the defenders at &quot;Huguette&quot; 6 made a daring break out, but only a few managed to make it to French lines. The Viet Minh repeated the isolation and probing attacks against &quot;Huguette&quot; 1, and overran the fort on the morning of 22 April. After this key advance, the Viet Minh took control of more than 90 percent of the airfield, making accurate French parachute drops impossible. This caused the landing zone to become perilously small, and effectively choked off much needed supplies. A French attack against &quot;Huguette&quot; 1 later that day was repulsed.

=== Isabelle ===

&quot;Isabelle&quot; saw only light action until 30 March, when the Viet Minh isolated it and beat back the attempt to send reinforcements north. Following a massive artillery barrage on 30 March, the Viet Minh began employing the same trench warfare tactics that they were using against the central camp. By the end of April, &quot;Isabelle&quot; had exhausted its water supply and was nearly out of ammunition.

=== Final attacks ===
The Viet Minh launched a massed assault against the exhausted defenders on the night of 1 May, overrunning &quot;Eliane&quot; 1, &quot;Dominique&quot; 3, and &quot;Huguette&quot; 5, although the French managed to beat back attacks on &quot;Eliane&quot; 2. On 6 May, the Viet Minh launched another massed attack against &quot;Eliane&quot; 2, using, for the first time, Katyusha rockets. The French artillery fired a &quot;TOT&quot; (time on target) mission, so that artillery rounds fired from different positions would strike on target at the same time. This barrage defeated the first assault wave, but later that night the Viet Minh detonated a mine under &quot;Eliane&quot; 2, with devastating effect. The Viet Minh attacked again, and within a few hours the defenders were overrun.

On 7 May, Giáp ordered an all-out attack against the remaining French units with over 25,000 Viet Minh against fewer than 3,000 garrison troops. At 17:00, de Castries radioed French headquarters in Hanoi and talked with Cogny: 

The last radio transmission from the French headquarters reported that enemy troops were directly outside the headquarters bunker and that all the positions had been overrun. The radio operator in his last words stated: &quot;The enemy has overrun us. We are blowing up everything. &quot;Vive la France&quot;!&quot; That night the garrison made a breakout attempt, in the Camarón tradition. While some of the main body managed to break out, none succeeded in escaping the valley. At &quot;Isabelle&quot;, a similar attempt later the same night saw about 70 troops, out of 1,700 men in the garrison, escape to Laos. By about 18:20, only one French position, strong point Lily, manned by Moroccan soldiers commanded by a French officer, Major Jean Nicolas, had not been overrun. The position surrendered that night when Nicolas personally waved a small white flag (probably a handkerchief) from his rifle.

== Aftermath ==
Dien Bien Phu was a serious defeat for the French and was the decisive battle of the Indochina war. The garrison constituted roughly one-tenth of the total French Union manpower in Indochina, and the defeat seriously weakened the position and prestige of the French; it produced psychological repercussions both in the armed forces and in the political structure in France. This was apparent with the previously planned negotiations over the future of Indochina, which had just begun. Militarily there was no point in France fighting on, as the Viet Minh could repeat the strategy and tactics of the Dien Bien Phu campaign elsewhere, to which the French had no effective response.

News of Dien Bien Phu&#x27;s fall was announced in France several hours after the surrender, around 16:45, by Prime Minister Joseph Laniel. The Archbishop of Paris ordered a mass, while radio performances were cancelled and replaced by solemn music, notably Berlioz&#x27; &quot;Requiem&quot;. Theatres and restaurants closed and many social engagements were cancelled as a mark of respect. Public opinion in France registered shock that a guerrilla army had defeated a major European power.

===Disaster in the Central Highlands===
Following the fall of Dien Bien Phu the French high command gave the order for any isolated positions to be abandoned, to avoid another disaster. The area of concern was the isolated defensive positions in the Central Highlands at An Khe. &quot;Groupement Mobile No. 100&quot; (&quot;Group Mobile 100&quot; or G.M. 100) which included the elite veteran UN &quot;Bataillon de Corée&quot; was ordered to abandon the area and fall back to Pleiku, some 50 miles away over Route Coloniale 19. Code named &quot;opération Églantine&quot;, GM.100, however were hit in a series of deadly ambushes at the Battle of Mang Yang Pass, suffering heavy losses in men and vehicles by 29 June and the remnants struggled back to Pleiku. 

The French then needed to keep &quot;Route Coloniale 14&quot; between Pleiku and Ban Mê Thuột open and withdraw the units posted there. Operation &quot;Myosotis&quot; &quot;(Forget-Me-Not)&quot; began - &#x27;Groupement Mobile No. 42&#x27; (GM.42) in an armoured convoy was sent to relieve the units, but were ambushed at the Battle of Chu Dreh Pass on July 17, just four days before the armistice suffering further heavy losses and the almost complete destruction of Bataillon de Corée.

=== Prisoners ===

On 8 May, the Viet Minh counted 11,721 prisoners, of whom 4,436 were wounded. This was the greatest number the Viet Minh had ever captured, amounting to one-third of the total captured during the entire war. The prisoners were divided into groups. Able-bodied soldiers were force-marched over to prison camps to the north and east, where they were intermingled with Viet Minh soldiers to discourage French bombing runs. Hundreds died of disease along the way. The wounded were given basic first aid until the Red Cross arrived, extracted 858 prisoners, and provided better aid to the remainder. Those wounded who were not evacuated by the Red Cross were sent into detention.

Only around 200 French soldiers managed to escape, going through the Viet Minh line towards Luang Prabang in Laos on the famous &quot;Pavie Trail&quot;. Of 10,863 prisoners (including Vietnamese fighting for the French), only 3,290 were repatriated four months later; however, the losses figure may include the 3,013 prisoners of Vietnamese origin whose fate is unknown.

=== Casualties ===
The Vietnamese government reported its casualties in the battle as 4,020 dead, 9,118 wounded, and 792 missing. The French estimated Viet Minh casualties at 8,000 dead and 15,000 wounded. Max Hastings stated that &quot;In 2018 Hanoi has still not credibly enumerated its Dien Bien Phu losses, surely a reflection of their immensity.&quot; Mark Moyar&#x27;s book &quot;Triumph Forsaken&quot; lists Viet Minh casualties as 22,900 out of an original force of 50,000.

=== Political ramifications ===
The Geneva Conference opened on 8 May 1954, the day after the surrender of the garrison. The resulting agreement in July partitioned Vietnam into two zones: communist North Vietnam and the State of Vietnam, which opposed the agreement, to the south. The partition was supposed to be temporary, and the two zones were meant to be reunited through national elections in 1956, which were never held. The last French forces withdrew from Vietnam in 1956.

General Georges Catroux presided over a commission of inquiry into the defeat. The commission&#x27;s final report (&quot;Rapport concernant la conduite des opérations en Indochine sous la direction du général Navarre&quot;) concluded:

The fall of Dien Bien Phu, in a strictly military perspective, represented a very serious failure but one that in the immediate, that is to say, spring of 1954, did not upset the balance of forces present in Indochina. It only assumed the aspect of a definitive defeat of our forces by reason of its profound psychological effects on French public opinion, which, tired of a war that was unpopular and seemingly without end, demanded in a way that it be ended.
The event itself was in fact, both in terms of public opinion and of the military conduct of the war and operations, merely the end result of a long process of degradation of a faraway enterprise which, not having the assent of the nation, could not receive from the authorities the energetic impulse, and the size and continuity of efforts required for success.
If, therefore, one wishes to establish objectively the responsibilities incurred in the final phase of the Indochina war one would have to examine its origins and evoke the acts and decisions of the various governments in power, that is to say their war policies, as well as the ways in which these policies were translated by the military commanders into operations.Outside of Indochina, the political significance of the battle was far-reaching, as news of the French defeat rapidly spread throughout the remainder of its colonies. The Algerian National Liberation Front viewed it as an epoch-changing moment, with Ferhat Abbas, post-colonial Algeria&#x27;s first president, declaring:Dien Bien Phu was more than just a military victory. This battle is a symbol. It&#x27;s the &quot;Valmy&quot; of the colonized peoples. It&#x27;s the affirmation of the Asian and the African vis-à-vis the European. It is the confirmation of the universality of human rights. At Dien Bien Phu, the French lost the only source of &quot;legitimation&quot; on which their presence turned, that is the right of the strongest [to rule the weakest].

=== Women ===
Many of the flights operated by the French Air force to evacuate casualties had female flight nurses on board. A total of 15 women served on flights to Điện Biên Phủ. One, Geneviève de Galard, was stranded there when her plane was destroyed by shellfire while it was being repaired on the airfield. She remained on the ground providing medical services in the field hospital until the surrender. She was referred to as the &quot;Angel of Điện Biên Phủ&quot;. Historians disagree regarding the moniker with Martin Windrow maintaining that de Galard was referred to by name only by the garrison; Michael Kenney and Bernard Fall also maintained that the nickname was added by outside press agencies.

The French forces came to Điện Biên Phủ accompanied by two &quot;bordels mobiles de campagne&quot;, (&#x27;mobile field brothels&#x27;), served by Algerian and Vietnamese women. When the siege ended, the Viet Minh sent the surviving Vietnamese women for &quot;re-education&quot;.

=== U.S. participation ===

Before the battle started both British and American missions visited Diên Biên Phu to complete an assessment, and then left.

The fall of Diên Biên Phu was a disaster not just for France but also for the United States who, by 1954, was underwriting 80% of French expenditures in Indochina. According to the Mutual Defense Assistance Act, the United States provided the French with material aid during the battle – aircraft (supplied by the ), weapons, mechanics, 24 CIA/CAT pilots, and U.S. Air Force maintenance crews.

The United States nevertheless intentionally avoided overt direct intervention. In February 1954, following the French occupation of Điện Biên Phủ, Democratic senator Michael Mansfield asked the United States Defense Secretary, Charles Erwin Wilson, whether the United States would send naval or air units if the French were subjected to greater pressure there, but Wilson replied that &quot;for the moment there is no justification for raising United States aid above its present level&quot;. On 31 March, following the fall of &quot;Beatrice&quot;, &quot;Gabrielle&quot;, and &quot;Anne-Marie&quot;, a panel of U.S. Senators and Representatives questioned the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Arthur W. Radford, about the possibility of U.S. involvement. Radford concluded it was too late for the U.S. Air Force which had the potential to use its Philippines-based B-29s against the Viet Minh heavy artillery. A proposal for direct intervention was unanimously voted down by the committee three days later, which &quot;concluded that intervention was a positive &quot;casus belli&quot; (act of war)&quot;.

Both Eisenhower and the Secretary of State John Foster Dulles then pressed the British and other allies in a joint military operation. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden refused, but agreed on a collective security arrangement for the region which could be agreed at the Geneva conference. For the Americans, in particular Dulles, this was not enough. Britain, already for some years involved in the Malayan Emergency, was concerned at the American alarmism in the region, but was unaware of the scale of U.S. financial aid and covert involvement in the Indochina war.

There were already suggestions at the time, notably from French author Jules Roy, that Admiral Radford had discussed with the French the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons in support of the French garrison. Moreover, Dulles reportedly mentioned the possibility of lending atomic bombs to the French for use at Điện Biên Phủ in April, Dulles tried to put more pressure on the British, and asked Eden for British support for American air action to save Diên Biên Phu. Eden refused, which enraged Dulles; however, Eisenhower relented. The President felt that, along with the political risks, airstrikes alone would not decide the battle, and did not want to escalate U.S. involvement by using American pilots. &quot;Nobody is more opposed to intervention than I am&quot;.
The United States did covertly participate in the battle. Following a request for help from Navarre, Radford provided two squadrons of B-26 Invader bomber aircraft and crew personnel to support the French. However not the Pentagon but the CIA under the leadership of Secretary Dulles&#x27; brother Allen Dulles managed the operation. Following this, 39 American transport pilots, officially employed by CAT, a CIA owned company, flew 682 sorties over the course of the battle. Earlier, in order to succeed the pre-Điện Biên Phủ Operation Castor of November 1953, General Chester McCarty made available twelve additional C-119 Flying Boxcars flown by French crews.

Two of the American pilots, James McGovern Jr., and Wallace Buford, were killed in action during the siege of Điện Biên Phủ. On 25 February 2005, the seven still-living American pilots were awarded the French Legion of Honor by Jean-David Levitte, the French Ambassador to the United States. The role of CIA controlled airlines in Indochina and their role at Điện Biên Phủ was little known until they were published by Robbins after the end of the Vietnam War, and not officially acknowledged until the 21st century. A generation later the U.S. historian Erik Kirsinger researched the case for more than a year.

Dulles, on hearing of the news of the fall of the garrison, was furious, placing heavy blame on Eden for his &quot;inaction&quot;. Eden, however, doubted that intervention could have saved Diên Biên Phu, and felt &quot;it might have far reaching consequences&quot;.

Colonel William F. Long stated twelve years after the defeat:

Dien Bien Phu—or DBP—has become an acronym or shorthand symbol for defeat of the West by the East, for the triumph of primitive new doctrines and techniques of peoples&#x27; war over the sophisticated principles and maxims of the heritage of Napoleon Bonaparte. Dien Bien Phu resulted in severe political consequences.

=== Comparison with Khe Sanh ===

In January 1968, during the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese Army under Võ Nguyên Giáp&#x27;s command initiated a siege and artillery bombardment on the U.S. Marine Corps base at Khe Sanh in South Vietnam, as they did at Điện Biên Phủ. A number of factors were significantly different between Khe Sanh and Điện Biên Phủ, however. Khe Sanh was much closer to a US supply base () compared to Điện Biên Phủ&#x27;s proximity to the nearest French base (). At Khe Sanh, the U.S. Marines held the high ground, and their artillery forced the North Vietnamese to use their own artillery from a much greater distance. By contrast, at Điện Biên Phủ, the French artillery (six 105 mm batteries and one battery of four 155 mm howitzers and mortars) was only sporadically effective. Furthermore, by 1968, the U.S. military presence in Vietnam dwarfed that of the French in 1954, and included numerous technological advances such as effective helicopters.

Khe Sanh received 18,000 tons of aerial resupplies during the 77-day battle, whereas during the 167 days that the French forces at Điện Biên Phủ held out, they received only 4,000 tons. Also, the U.S. Air Force dropped 114,810 tons of bombs on the North Vietnamese at Khe Sanh, roughly as many as dropped on all of Japan in 1945 during World War II.

It is also possible that Giáp never intended to capture Khe Sanh in the first place, and that Khe Sanh was used as a diversion for the upcoming Tet Offensive.

===Battlefield today===
Điện Biên Phủ today is a popular Vietnam historical tourist attraction. It has a modern museum and much of the battlefield is preserved, including several of the fortified French positions, the bunkered French headquarters, the Viet Minh headquarters complex and a number of memorials.

===In popular culture===
* The battle was a subject in the 1992 French film &quot;Dien Bien Phu&quot; written and directed by Pierre Schoendoerffer, who had been present at the battle as a war cameramen.
* The beginning of the 1966 film &quot;Lost Command&quot; starring Anthony Quinn showed the battle towards its end. The film was adapted from the French novel &quot;Les Centurions&quot; written by French journalist and former soldier Jean Lartéguy.
* The 1989 pop rock song We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire by American artist Billy Joel mentions the battle (&#x27;Dien Bien Phu Falls&#x27;) in the second verse of the song.

<text>Holography is a technique that enables a wavefront to be recorded and later reconstructed. It is best known as a method of generating three-dimensional images, and has a wide range of other uses, including data storage, microscopy, and interferometry. In principle, it is possible to make a hologram for any type of wave.

A hologram is a recording of an interference pattern that can reproduce a 3D light field using diffraction. In general usage, a hologram is a recording of any type of wavefront in the form of an interference pattern. It can be created by capturing light from a real scene, or it can be generated by a computer, in which case it is known as a computer-generated hologram, which can show virtual objects or scenes. Optical holography needs a laser light to record the light field. The reproduced light field can generate an image that has the depth and parallax of the original scene. A hologram is usually unintelligible when viewed under diffuse ambient light. When suitably lit, the interference pattern diffracts the light into an accurate reproduction of the original light field, and the objects that were in it exhibit visual depth cues such as parallax and perspective that change realistically with the different angles of viewing. That is, the view of the image from different angles shows the subject viewed from similar angles.

A hologram is traditionally generated by overlaying a second wavefront, known as the reference beam, onto a wavefront of interest. This generates an interference pattern, which is then captured on a physical medium. When the recorded interference pattern is later illuminated by the second wavefront, it is diffracted to recreate the original wavefront. The 3D image from a hologram can often be viewed with non-laser light. However, in common practice, major image quality compromises are made to remove the need for laser illumination to view the hologram.

A computer-generated hologram is created by digitally modeling and combining two wavefronts to generate an interference pattern image. This image can then be printed onto a mask or film and illuminated with an appropriate light source to reconstruct the desired wavefront. Alternatively, the interference pattern image can be directly displayed on a dynamic holographic display.

Holographic portraiture often resorts to a non-holographic intermediate imaging procedure, to avoid the dangerous high-powered pulsed lasers which would be needed to optically &quot;freeze&quot; moving subjects as perfectly as the extremely motion-intolerant holographic recording process requires. Early holography required high-power and expensive lasers. Currently, mass-produced low-cost laser diodes, such as those found on DVD recorders and used in other common applications, can be used to make holograms. They have made holography much more accessible to low-budget researchers, artists, and dedicated hobbyists.

Most holograms produced are of static objects, but systems for displaying changing scenes on dynamic holographic displays are now being developed.

The word &quot;holography&quot; comes from the Greek words (&quot;holos&quot;; &quot;whole&quot;) and (&quot;graphē&quot;; &quot;writing&quot; or &quot;drawing&quot;).

==History==

The Hungarian-British physicist Dennis Gabor invented holography in 1948 while he was looking for a way to improve image resolution in electron microscopes. Gabor&#x27;s work was built on pioneering work in the field of X-ray microscopy by other scientists including Mieczysław Wolfke in 1920 and William Lawrence Bragg in 1939. The formulation of holography was an unexpected result of Gabor&#x27;s research into improving electron microscopes at the British Thomson-Houston Company (BTH) in Rugby, England, and the company filed a patent in December 1947 (patent GB685286). The technique as originally invented is still used in electron microscopy, where it is known as electron holography. Gabor was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971 &quot;for his invention and development of the holographic method&quot;.
Optical holography did not really advance until the development of the laser in 1960. The development of the laser enabled the first practical optical holograms that recorded 3D objects to be made in 1962 by Yuri Denisyuk in the Soviet Union and by Emmett Leith and Juris Upatnieks at the University of Michigan, US.

Early optical holograms used silver halide photographic emulsions as the recording medium. They were not very efficient as the produced diffraction grating absorbed much of the incident light. Various methods of converting the variation in transmission to a variation in refractive index (known as &quot;bleaching&quot;) were developed which enabled much more efficient holograms to be produced.

A major advance in the field of holography was made by Stephen Benton, who invented a way to create holograms that can be viewed with natural light instead of lasers. These are called rainbow holograms.

==Basics of holography==


Holography is a technique for recording and reconstructing light fields. 
A light field is generally the result of a light source scattered off objects. Holography can be thought of as somewhat similar to sound recording, whereby a sound field created by vibrating matter like musical instruments or vocal cords, is encoded in such a way that it can be reproduced later, without the presence of the original vibrating matter. However, it is even more similar to Ambisonic sound recording in which any listening angle of a sound field can be reproduced in the reproduction.

===Laser===
In laser holography, the hologram is recorded using a source of laser light, which is very pure in its color and orderly in its composition. Various setups may be used, and several types of holograms can be made, but all involve the interaction of light coming from different directions and producing a microscopic interference pattern which a plate, film, or other medium photographically records.

In one common arrangement, the laser beam is split into two, one known as the object beam and the other as the reference beam. The object beam is expanded by passing it through a lens and used to illuminate the subject. The recording medium is located where this light, after being reflected or scattered by the subject, will strike it. The edges of the medium will ultimately serve as a window through which the subject is seen, so its location is chosen with that in mind. The reference beam is expanded and made to shine directly on the medium, where it interacts with the light coming from the subject to create the desired interference pattern.

Like conventional photography, holography requires an appropriate exposure time to correctly affect the recording medium. Unlike conventional photography, during the exposure the light source, the optical elements, the recording medium, and the subject must all remain motionless relative to each other, to within about a quarter of the wavelength of the light, or the interference pattern will be blurred and the hologram spoiled. With living subjects and some unstable materials, that is only possible if a very intense and extremely brief pulse of laser light is used, a hazardous procedure which is rarely done outside of scientific and industrial laboratory settings. Exposures lasting several seconds to several minutes, using a much lower-powered continuously operating laser, are typical.

===Apparatus===
A hologram can be made by shining part of the light beam directly into the recording medium, and the other part onto the object in such a way that some of the scattered light falls onto the recording medium. A more flexible arrangement for recording a hologram requires the laser beam to be aimed through a series of elements that change it in different ways. The first element is a beam splitter that divides the beam into two identical beams, each aimed in different directions:
* One beam (known as the &#x27;illumination&#x27; or &#x27;object beam&#x27;) is spread using lenses and directed onto the scene using mirrors. Some of the light scattered (reflected) from the scene then falls onto the recording medium.
* The second beam (known as the &#x27;reference beam&#x27;) is also spread through the use of lenses, but is directed so that it does not come in contact with the scene, and instead travels directly onto the recording medium.

Several different materials can be used as the recording medium. One of the most common is a film very similar to photographic film (silver halide photographic emulsion), but with much smaller light-reactive grains (preferably with diameters less than 20 nm), making it capable of the much higher resolution that holograms require. A layer of this recording medium (e.g., silver halide) is attached to a transparent substrate, which is commonly glass, but may also be plastic.

===Process===
When the two laser beams reach the recording medium, their light waves intersect and interfere with each other. It is this interference pattern that is imprinted on the recording medium. The pattern itself is seemingly random, as it represents the way in which the scene&#x27;s light &quot;interfered&quot; with the original light source – but not the original light source itself. The interference pattern can be considered an encoded version of the scene, requiring a particular key – the original light source – in order to view its contents.

This missing key is provided later by shining a laser, identical to the one used to record the hologram, onto the developed film. When this beam illuminates the hologram, it is diffracted by the hologram&#x27;s surface pattern. This produces a light field identical to the one originally produced by the scene and scattered onto the hologram.

===Comparison with photography===
Holography may be better understood via an examination of its differences from ordinary photography:
* A hologram represents a recording of information regarding the light that came from the original scene as scattered in a range of directions rather than from only one direction, as in a photograph. This allows the scene to be viewed from a range of different angles, as if it were still present.
* A photograph can be recorded using normal light sources (sunlight or electric lighting) whereas a laser is required to record a hologram.
* A lens is required in photography to record the image, whereas in holography, the light from the object is scattered directly onto the recording medium.
* A holographic recording requires a second light beam (the reference beam) to be directed onto the recording medium.
* A photograph can be viewed in a wide range of lighting conditions, whereas holograms can only be viewed with very specific forms of illumination.
* When a photograph is cut in half, each piece shows half of the scene. When a hologram is cut in half, the whole scene can still be seen in each piece. This is because, whereas each point in a photograph only represents light scattered from a single point in the scene, &quot;each point&quot; on a holographic recording includes information about light scattered from &quot;every point&quot; in the scene. It can be thought of as viewing a street outside a house through a large window, then through a smaller window. One can see all of the same things through the smaller window (by moving the head to change the viewing angle), but the viewer can see more &quot;at once&quot; through the large window.
* A photographic stereogram is a two-dimensional representation that can produce a three-dimensional effect but only from one point of view, whereas the reproduced viewing range of a hologram adds many more depth perception cues that were present in the original scene. These cues are recognized by the human brain and translated into the same perception of a three-dimensional image as when the original scene might have been viewed.
* A photograph clearly maps out the light field of the original scene. The developed hologram&#x27;s surface consists of a very fine, seemingly random pattern, which appears to bear no relationship to the scene it recorded.

==Physics of holography==

For a better understanding of the process, it is necessary to understand interference and diffraction. Interference occurs when one or more wavefronts are superimposed. Diffraction occurs when a wavefront encounters an object. The process of producing a holographic reconstruction is explained below purely in terms of interference and diffraction. It is somewhat simplified but is accurate enough to give an understanding of how the holographic process works.

For those unfamiliar with these concepts, it is worthwhile to read those articles before reading further in this article.

===Plane wavefronts===
A diffraction grating is a structure with a repeating pattern. A simple example is a metal plate with slits cut at regular intervals. A light wave that is incident on a grating is split into several waves; the direction of these diffracted waves is determined by the grating spacing and the wavelength of the light.

A simple hologram can be made by superimposing two plane waves from the same light source on a holographic recording medium. The two waves interfere, giving a straight-line fringe pattern whose intensity varies sinusoidally across the medium. The spacing of the fringe pattern is determined by the angle between the two waves, and by the wavelength of the light.

The recorded light pattern is a diffraction grating. When it is illuminated by only one of the waves used to create it, it can be shown that one of the diffracted waves emerges at the same angle at which the second wave was originally incident, so that the second wave has been &#x27;reconstructed&#x27;. Thus, the recorded light pattern is a holographic recording as defined above.

===Point sources===
If the recording medium is illuminated with a point source and a normally incident plane wave, the resulting pattern is a sinusoidal zone plate, which acts as a negative Fresnel lens whose focal length is equal to the separation of the point source and the recording plane.

When a plane wave-front illuminates a negative lens, it is expanded into a wave that appears to diverge from the focal point of the lens. Thus, when the recorded pattern is illuminated with the original plane wave, some of the light is diffracted into a diverging beam equivalent to the original spherical wave; a holographic recording of the point source has been created.

When the plane wave is incident at a non-normal angle at the time of recording, the pattern formed is more complex, but still acts as a negative lens if it is illuminated at the original angle.

===Complex objects===
To record a hologram of a complex object, a laser beam is first split into two beams of light. One beam illuminates the object, which then scatters light onto the recording medium. According to diffraction theory, each point in the object acts as a point source of light so the recording medium can be considered to be illuminated by a set of point sources located at varying distances from the medium.

The second (reference) beam illuminates the recording medium directly. Each point source wave interferes with the reference beam, giving rise to its own sinusoidal zone plate in the recording medium. The resulting pattern is the sum of all these &#x27;zone plates&#x27;, which combine to produce a random (speckle) pattern as in the photograph above.

When the hologram is illuminated by the original reference beam, each of the individual zone plates reconstructs the object wave that produced it, and these individual wavefronts are combined to reconstruct the whole of the object beam. The viewer perceives a wavefront that is identical with the wavefront scattered from the object onto the recording medium, so that it appears that the object is still in place even if it has been removed.

==Applications==

===Art===
Early on, artists saw the potential of holography as a medium and gained access to science laboratories to create their work. Holographic art is often the result of collaborations between scientists and artists, although some holographers would regard themselves as both an artist and a scientist.

Salvador Dalí claimed to have been the first to employ holography artistically. He was certainly the first and best-known surrealist to do so, but the 1972 New York exhibit of Dalí holograms had been preceded by the holographic art exhibition that was held at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan in 1968 and by the one at the Finch College gallery in New York in 1970, which attracted national media attention. In Great Britain, Margaret Benyon began using holography as an artistic medium in the late 1960s and had a solo exhibition at the University of Nottingham art gallery in 1969. This was followed in 1970 by a solo show at the Lisson Gallery in London, which was billed as the &quot;first London expo of holograms and stereoscopic paintings&quot;.

During the 1970s, a number of art studios and schools were established, each with their particular approach to holography. Notably, there was the San Francisco School of Holography established by Lloyd Cross, The Museum of Holography in New York founded by Rosemary (Posy) H. Jackson, the Royal College of Art in London and the Lake Forest College Symposiums organised by Tung Jeong. None of these studios still exist; however, there is the Center for the Holographic Arts in New York and the HOLOcenter in Seoul, which offers artists a place to create and exhibit work.

During the 1980s, many artists who worked with holography helped the diffusion of this so-called &quot;new medium&quot; in the art world, such as Harriet Casdin-Silver of the United States, Dieter Jung of Germany, and Moysés Baumstein of Brazil, each one searching for a proper &quot;language&quot; to use with the three-dimensional work, avoiding the simple holographic reproduction of a sculpture or object. For instance, in Brazil, many concrete poets (Augusto de Campos, Décio Pignatari, Julio Plaza and José Wagner Garcia, associated with Moysés Baumstein) found in holography a way to express themselves and to renew concrete poetry.

A small but active group of artists still integrate holographic elements into their work. Some are associated with novel holographic techniques; for example, artist Matt Brand employed computational mirror design to eliminate image distortion from specular holography.

The MIT Museum and Jonathan Ross both have extensive collections of holography and on-line catalogues of art holograms.

===Data storage===

Holographic data storage is a technique that can store information at high density inside crystals or photopolymers. The ability to store large amounts of information in some kind of medium is of great importance, as many electronic products incorporate storage devices. As current storage techniques such as Blu-ray Disc reach the limit of possible data density (due to the diffraction-limited size of the writing beams), holographic storage has the potential to become the next generation of popular storage media. The advantage of this type of data storage is that the volume of the recording media is used instead of just the surface.
Currently available SLMs can produce about 1000 different images a second at 1024×1024-bit resolution which would result in about one-gigabit-per-second writing speed.

In 2005, companies such as Optware and Maxell produced a 120 mm disc that uses a holographic layer to store data to a potential 3.9 TB, a format called Holographic Versatile Disc. As of September 2014, no commercial product has been released.

Another company, InPhase Technologies, was developing a competing format, but went bankrupt in 2011 and all its assets were sold to Akonia Holographics, LLC.

While many holographic data storage models have used &quot;page-based&quot; storage, where each recorded hologram holds a large amount of data, more recent research into using submicrometre-sized &quot;microholograms&quot; has resulted in several potential 3D optical data storage solutions. While this approach to data storage can not attain the high data rates of page-based storage, the tolerances, technological hurdles, and cost of producing a commercial product are significantly lower.

===Dynamic holography===
In static holography, recording, developing and reconstructing occur sequentially, and a permanent hologram is produced.

There also exist holographic materials that do not need the developing process and can record a hologram in a very short time. This allows one to use holography to perform some simple operations in an all-optical way. Examples of applications of such real-time holograms include phase-conjugate mirrors (&quot;time-reversal&quot; of light), optical cache memories, image processing (pattern recognition of time-varying images), and optical computing.

The amount of processed information can be very high (terabits/s), since the operation is performed in parallel on a whole image. This compensates for the fact that the recording time, which is in the order of a microsecond, is still very long compared to the processing time of an electronic computer. The optical processing performed by a dynamic hologram is also much less flexible than electronic processing. On one side, one has to perform the operation always on the whole image, and on the other side, the operation a hologram can perform is basically either a multiplication or a phase conjugation. In optics, addition and Fourier transform are already easily performed in linear materials, the latter simply by a lens. This enables some applications, such as a device that compares images in an optical way.

The search for novel nonlinear optical materials for dynamic holography is an active area of research. The most common materials are photorefractive crystals, but in semiconductors or semiconductor heterostructures (such as quantum wells), atomic vapors and gases, plasmas and even liquids, it was possible to generate holograms.

A particularly promising application is optical phase conjugation. It allows the removal of the wavefront distortions a light beam receives when passing through an aberrating medium, by sending it back through the same aberrating medium with a conjugated phase. This is useful, for example, in free-space optical communications to compensate for atmospheric turbulence (the phenomenon that gives rise to the twinkling of starlight).

===Hobbyist use===
Since the beginning of holography, many holographers have explored its uses and displayed them to the public.

In 1971, Lloyd Cross opened the San Francisco School of Holography and taught amateurs how to make holograms using only a small (typically 5 mW) helium-neon laser and inexpensive home-made equipment. Holography had been supposed to require a very expensive metal optical table set-up to lock all the involved elements down in place and damp any vibrations that could blur the interference fringes and ruin the hologram. Cross&#x27;s home-brew alternative was a sandbox made of a cinder block retaining wall on a plywood base, supported on stacks of old tires to isolate it from ground vibrations, and filled with sand that had been washed to remove dust. The laser was securely mounted atop the cinder block wall. The mirrors and simple lenses needed for directing, splitting and expanding the laser beam were affixed to short lengths of PVC pipe, which were stuck into the sand at the desired locations. The subject and the photographic plate holder were similarly supported within the sandbox. The holographer turned off the room light, blocked the laser beam near its source using a small relay-controlled shutter, loaded a plate into the holder in the dark, left the room, waited a few minutes to let everything settle, then made the exposure by remotely operating the laser shutter.

In 1979, Jason Sapan opened the Holographic Studios in New York City. Since then, they have been involved in the production of many holographs for many artists as well as companies. Sapan has been described as the &quot;last professional holographer of New York&quot;.

Many of these holographers would go on to produce art holograms. In 1983, Fred Unterseher, a co-founder of the San Francisco School of Holography and a well-known holographic artist, published the &quot;Holography Handbook&quot;, an easy-to-read guide to making holograms at home. This brought in a new wave of holographers and provided simple methods for using the then-available AGFA silver halide recording materials.

In 2000, Frank DeFreitas published the &quot;Shoebox Holography Book&quot; and introduced the use of inexpensive laser pointers to countless hobbyists. For many years, it had been assumed that certain characteristics of semiconductor laser diodes made them virtually useless for creating holograms, but when they were eventually put to the test of practical experiment, it was found that not only was this untrue, but that some actually provided a coherence length much greater than that of traditional helium-neon gas lasers. This was a very important development for amateurs, as the price of red laser diodes had dropped from hundreds of dollars in the early 1980s to about $5 after they entered the mass market as a component pulled from CD, or later, DVD players from the mid 1980s onwards. Now, there are thousands of amateur holographers worldwide.

By late 2000, holography kits with inexpensive laser pointer diodes entered the mainstream consumer market. These kits enabled students, teachers, and hobbyists to make several kinds of holograms without specialized equipment, and became popular gift items by 2005. The introduction of holography kits with self-developing plates in 2003 made it possible for hobbyists to create holograms without the bother of wet chemical processing.

In 2006, a large number of surplus holography-quality green lasers (Coherent C315) became available and put dichromated gelatin (DCG) holography within the reach of the amateur holographer. The holography community was surprised at the amazing sensitivity of DCG to green light. It had been assumed that this sensitivity would be uselessly slight or non-existent. Jeff Blyth responded with the G307 formulation of DCG to increase the speed and sensitivity to these new lasers.

Kodak and Agfa, the former major suppliers of holography-quality silver halide plates and films, are no longer in the market. While other manufacturers have helped fill the void, many amateurs are now making their own materials. The favorite formulations are dichromated gelatin, Methylene-Blue-sensitised dichromated gelatin, and diffusion method silver halide preparations. Jeff Blyth has published very accurate methods for making these in a small lab or garage.

A small group of amateurs are even constructing their own pulsed lasers to make holograms of living subjects and other unsteady or moving objects.

===Holographic interferometry===
Holographic interferometry (HI) is a technique that enables static and dynamic displacements of objects with optically rough surfaces to be measured to optical interferometric precision (i.e. to fractions of a wavelength of light). It can also be used to detect optical-path-length variations in transparent media, which enables, for example, fluid flow to be visualized and analyzed. It can also be used to generate contours representing the form of the surface or the isodose regions in radiation dosimetry.

It has been widely used to measure stress, strain, and vibration in engineering structures.

===Interferometric microscopy===
The hologram keeps the information on the amplitude and phase of the field. Several holograms may keep information about the same distribution of light, emitted to various directions. The numerical analysis of such holograms allows one to emulate large numerical aperture, which, in turn, enables enhancement of the resolution of optical microscopy. The corresponding technique is called interferometric microscopy. Recent achievements of interferometric microscopy allow one to approach the quarter-wavelength limit of resolution.

===Sensors or biosensors===
The hologram is made with a modified material that interacts with certain molecules generating a change in the fringe periodicity or refractive index, therefore, the color of the holographic reflection.

===Security===

Holograms are commonly used for security, as they are replicated from a master hologram that requires expensive, specialized and technologically advanced equipment, and are thus difficult to forge. They are used widely in many currencies, such as the Brazilian 20, 50, and 100-reais notes; British 5, 10, 20 and 50-pound notes; South Korean 5000, 10,000, and 50,000-won notes; Japanese 5000 and 10,000 yen notes, Indian 50, 100, 500, and 2000 rupee notes; and all the currently-circulating banknotes of the Canadian dollar, Croatian kuna, Danish krone, and Euro. They can also be found in credit and bank cards as well as passports, ID cards, books, food packaging, DVDs, and sports equipment. Such holograms come in a variety of forms, from adhesive strips that are laminated on packaging for fast-moving consumer goods to holographic tags on electronic products. They often contain textual or pictorial elements to protect identities and separate genuine articles from counterfeits.

Holographic scanners are in use in post offices, larger shipping firms, and automated conveyor systems to determine the three-dimensional size of a package. They are often used in tandem with checkweighers to allow automated pre-packing of given volumes, such as a truck or pallet for bulk shipment of goods.
Holograms produced in elastomers can be used as stress-strain reporters due to its elasticity and compressibility, the pressure and force applied are correlated to the reflected wavelength, therefore its color. Holography technique can also be effectively used for radiation dosimetry.

==== High security registration plates ====
High-security holograms can be used on license plates for vehicles such as cars and motorcycles. As of April 2019, holographic license plates are required on vehicles in parts of India to aid in identification and security, especially in cases of car theft. Such number plates hold electronic data of vehicles, and have a unique ID number and a sticker to indicate authenticity.

==Holography using other types of waves==
In principle, it is possible to make a hologram for any wave.

Electron holography is the application of holography techniques to electron waves rather than light waves. Electron holography was invented by Dennis Gabor to improve the resolution and avoid the aberrations of the transmission electron microscope. Today it is commonly used to study electric and magnetic fields in thin films, as magnetic and electric fields can shift the phase of the interfering wave passing through the sample. The principle of electron holography can also be applied to interference lithography.

Acoustic holography enables sound maps of an object to be generated. Measurements of the acoustic field are made at many points close to the object. These measurements are digitally processed to produce the &quot;images&quot; of the object.

Atomic holography has evolved out of the development of the basic elements of atom optics. With the Fresnel diffraction lens and atomic mirrors atomic holography follows a natural step in the development of the physics (and applications) of atomic beams. Recent developments including atomic mirrors and especially ridged mirrors have provided the tools necessary for the creation of atomic holograms, although such holograms have not yet been commercialized.

Neutron beam holography has been used to see the inside of solid objects.

Holograms with x-rays are generated by using synchrotrons or x-ray free-electron lasers as radiation sources and pixelated detectors such as CCDs as recording medium. The reconstruction is then retrieved via computation. Due to the shorter wavelength of x-rays compared to visible light, this approach allows imaging objects with higher spatial resolution. As free-electron lasers can provide ultrashort and x-ray pulses in the range of femtoseconds which are intense and coherent, x-ray holography has been used to capture ultrafast dynamic processes.

==False holograms==


There are many optical effects that are falsely confused with holography, such as the effects produced by lenticular printing, the Pepper&#x27;s ghost illusion (or modern variants such as the Musion Eyeliner), tomography and volumetric displays. Such illusions have been called &quot;fauxlography&quot;.

The Pepper&#x27;s ghost technique, being the easiest to implement of these methods, is most prevalent in 3D displays that claim to be (or are referred to as) &quot;holographic&quot;. While the original illusion, used in theater, involved actual physical objects and persons, located offstage, modern variants replace the source object with a digital screen, which displays imagery generated with 3D computer graphics to provide the necessary depth cues. The reflection, which seems to float mid-air, is still flat however, thus less realistic than if an actual 3D object was being reflected.

Examples of this digital version of Pepper&#x27;s ghost illusion include the Gorillaz performances in the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards and the 48th Grammy Awards; and Tupac Shakur&#x27;s virtual performance at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2012, rapping alongside Snoop Dogg during his set with Dr. Dre. Digital avatars of the Swedish supergroup ABBA were displayed on stage in May 2022. The ABBA performance used technology that was an updated version of Pepper&#x27;s Ghost created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic. American rock group KISS unveiled similar digital avatars in December 2023 to tour in their place at the conclusion of the End of the Road World Tour using the same Pepper&#x27;s Ghost technology as the ABBA avatars.

An even simpler illusion can be created by rear-projecting realistic images into semi-transparent screens. The rear projection is necessary because otherwise the semi-transparency of the screen would allow the background to be illuminated by the projection, which would break the illusion.

Crypton Future Media, a music software company that produced Hatsune Miku, one of many Vocaloid singing synthesizer applications, has produced concerts that have Miku, along with other Crypton Vocaloids, performing on stage as &quot;holographic&quot; characters. These concerts use rear projection onto a semi-transparent DILAD screen to achieve its &quot;holographic&quot; effect.

In 2011, in Beijing, apparel company Burberry produced the &quot;Burberry Prorsum Autumn/Winter 2011 Hologram Runway Show&quot;, which included life size 2-D projections of models. The company&#x27;s own video shows several centered and off-center shots of the main 2-dimensional projection screen, the latter revealing the flatness of the virtual models. The claim that holography was used was reported as fact in the trade media.

In Madrid, on 10 April 2015, a public visual presentation called &quot;Hologramas por la Libertad&quot; (Holograms for Liberty), featuring a ghostly virtual crowd of demonstrators, was used to protest a new Spanish law that prohibits citizens from demonstrating in public places. Although widely called a &quot;hologram protest&quot; in news reports, no actual holography was involved – it was yet another technologically updated variant of the Pepper&#x27;s ghost illusion.

Holography is distinct from specular holography which is a technique for making three-dimensional images by controlling the motion of specularities on a two-dimensional surface. It works by reflectively or refractively manipulating bundles of light rays, not by using interference and diffraction.

==Tactile holograms==
==In fiction==
Holography has been widely referred to in movies, novels, and TV, usually in science fiction, starting in the late 1970s. Science fiction writers absorbed the urban legends surrounding holography that had been spread by overly-enthusiastic scientists and entrepreneurs trying to market the idea. This had the effect of giving the public overly high expectations of the capability of holography, due to the unrealistic depictions of it in most fiction, where they are fully three-dimensional computer projections that are sometimes tactile through the use of force fields. Examples of this type of depiction include the hologram of Princess Leia in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Arnold Rimmer from &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, who was later converted to &quot;hard light&quot; to make him solid, and the Holodeck and Emergency Medical Hologram from &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Holography has served as an inspiration for many video games with science fiction elements. In many titles, fictional holographic technology has been used to reflect real life misrepresentations of potential military use of holograms, such as the &quot;mirage tanks&quot; in &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2&quot; that can disguise themselves as trees. Player characters are able to use holographic decoys in games such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Crysis 2&quot; to confuse and distract the enemy. &quot;Starcraft&quot; ghost agent Nova has access to &quot;holo decoy&quot; as one of her three primary abilities in &quot;Heroes of the Storm.&quot;

Fictional depictions of holograms have, however, inspired technological advances in other fields, such as augmented reality, that promise to fulfill the fictional depictions of holograms by other means.

<doc id="66340" wikidata="Q213728" url="?curid=66340" title="Goldberg Variations">
<text>The Goldberg Variations (), BWV 988, is a musical composition for keyboard by Johann Sebastian Bach, consisting of an aria and a set of 30 variations. First published in 1741, it is named after Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, who may also have been the first performer of the work.

== Composition ==
The story of how the variations came to be composed comes from an early biography of Bach by Johann Nikolaus Forkel:

Forkel wrote his biography in 1802, more than 60 years after the events related, and its accuracy has been questioned. The lack of dedication on the title page also makes the tale of the commission unlikely. Goldberg&#x27;s age at the time of publication (14 years) has also been cited as grounds for doubting Forkel&#x27;s tale, although it must be said that he was known to be an accomplished keyboardist and sight-reader. contends that the Forkel story is entirely spurious.

Arnold Schering has suggested that the aria on which the variations are based was not written by Bach. More recent scholarly literature (such as the edition by Christoph Wolff) suggests that there is no basis for such doubts.

== Publication ==
Rather unusually for Bach&#x27;s works, the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; were published in his own lifetime, in 1741. The publisher was Bach&#x27;s friend Balthasar Schmid of Nuremberg. Schmid printed the work by making engraved copper plates (rather than using movable type); thus the notes of the first edition are in Schmid&#x27;s own handwriting.

The title page, shown in the figure above, reads in German:
The term &quot;&quot;Clavier Ubung&quot; (nowadays spelled &quot;Klavierübung&quot;) had been assigned by Bach to some of his previous keyboard works. Klavierübung part 1 was the six partitas, part 2 the &quot;Italian Concerto&quot; and &quot;French Overture&quot;, and part 3 a series of chorale preludes for organ framed by a prelude and fugue in E major. Although Bach also called his variations &quot;Klavierübung&quot;, he did not specifically designate them as the fourth in this series.

Nineteen copies of the first edition survive today. Of these, the most valuable is the (Bach&#x27;s personal copy of the published score), discovered in 1974 in Strasbourg by the French musicologist Olivier Alain and now kept in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris. This copy includes printing corrections made by the composer and additional music in the form of fourteen canons on the Goldberg ground (see below). The nineteen printed copies provide virtually the only information available to modern editors trying to reconstruct Bach&#x27;s intent, as the autograph (handwritten) score has not survived. A handwritten copy of just the aria is found in the 1725 Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach. Christoph Wolff suggests on the basis of handwriting evidence that Anna Magdalena copied the aria from the autograph score around 1740; it appears on two pages previously left blank.

==Instrumentation==
On the title page, Bach specified that the work was intended for harpsichord. It is widely performed on this instrument today, though there are also a great number of performances on the piano (see Discography below). The piano was rare in Bach&#x27;s day and there is no indication that Bach would have either approved or disapproved of performing the variations on this instrument.

Bach&#x27;s specification is, more precisely, a two-manual harpsichord, and he indicated in the score which variations ought to be played using one hand on each manual: Variations 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 26, 27 and 28 are specified for two manuals, while variations 5, 7 and 29 are specified as playable with either one or two. With greater difficulty, the work can nevertheless be played on a single-manual harpsichord or piano.

== Form ==
After a statement of the aria at the beginning of the piece, there are thirty variations. The variations do not follow the melody of the aria, but rather use its bass line () and chord progression. The bass line is notated by harpsichordist and musicologist Ralph Kirkpatrick in his performing edition as follows.
&lt;score&gt;

 \clef bass
 \omit Staff.TimeSignature
 \repeat volta 2 {
 g1 fis^&quot;6&quot; e^&quot;3,5,6♯&quot; d b^&quot;6&quot; c^&quot;3,5,6&quot; d g, \break

 c^&quot;6&quot; b^&quot;6&quot; a d g, c^&quot;3,5,6&quot; d g,
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The digits above the notes indicate the specified chord in the system of figured bass; where digits are separated by comma (stacked vertically in a proper figured bass), they indicate seventh chords in first inversion.

Every third variation in the series of 30 is a canon, following an ascending pattern. Thus, variation 3 is a canon at the unison, variation 6 is a canon at the second (the second entry begins the interval of a second above the first), variation 9 is a canon at the third, and so on until variation 27, which is a canon at the ninth. The final variation, instead of being the expected canon in the tenth, is a quodlibet, discussed below.

As Kirkpatrick has pointed out, the variations that intervene between the canons are also arranged in a pattern. If we leave aside the initial and final material of the work (specifically, the Aria, the first two variations, the Quodlibet, and the aria da capo), the remaining material is arranged as follows. The variations found just &quot;after&quot; each canon are genre pieces of various types, among them three Baroque dances (4, 7, 19); a fughetta (10); a French overture (16); two ornate arias for the right hand (13, 25); and others (22, 28). The variations located &quot;two&quot; after each canon (5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, and 29) are what Kirkpatrick calls &quot;arabesques&quot;; they are variations in lively tempo with a great deal of hand-crossing. This ternary pattern—&quot;canon&quot;, &quot;genre piece&quot;, &quot;arabesque&quot;—is repeated a total of nine times, until the Quodlibet breaks the cycle.

All the variations are in G major, apart from variations 15, 21, and 25, which are in G minor.

At the end of the thirty variations, Bach writes &quot;Aria da Capo e fine&quot;, meaning that the performer is to return to the beginning (&quot;da capo&quot;) and play the aria again before concluding.

=== Aria ===
The aria is a sarabande in time, and features a heavily ornamented melody:

&lt;/score&gt;

The French style of ornamentation suggests that the ornaments are supposed to be parts of the melody; however, some performers (for example Wilhelm Kempff on piano) omit some or all ornaments and present the aria unadorned.

Williams opines that this is not the theme at all, but actually the first variation (a view emphasising the idea of the work as a chaconne rather than a piece in true variation form).

=== Variatio 1. a 1 Clav. ===

This sprightly variation contrasts markedly with the slow, contemplative mood of the aria. The rhythm in the right hand forces the emphasis on the second beat, giving rise to syncopation from bars 1 to 7. Hands cross at bar 13 from the upper register to the lower, bringing back this syncopation for another two bars. In the first two bars of the B part, the rhythm mirrors that of the beginning of the A part, but after this a different idea is introduced.

Williams sees this as a sort of polonaise. The characteristic rhythm in the left hand is also found in Bach&#x27;s Partita No. 3 for solo violin, in the A major prelude from the first book of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, and in the D minor prelude of the second book. Heinz Niemüller also mentions the polonaise character of this variation.

=== Variatio 2. a 1 Clav. ===

This is a simple three-part contrapuntal piece in time, two voices engage in constant motivic interplay over an incessant bass line. Each section has an alternate ending to be played on the first and second repeat.

=== Variatio 3. Canone all&#x27;Unisono. a 1 Clav. ===

The first of the regular canons, this is a canon at the unison: the follower begins on the same note as the leader, a bar later. As with all canons of the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; (except the 27th variation, canon at the ninth), there is a supporting bass line. The time signature of and the many sets of triplets suggest a kind of a simple dance.

=== Variatio 4. a 1 Clav. ===

Like the passepied, a Baroque dance movement, this variation is in time with a preponderance of quaver rhythms. Bach uses close but not exact imitation: the musical pattern in one part reappears a bar later in another (sometimes inverted).

Each repeated section has alternate endings for the first or second time.

=== Variatio 5. a 1 ô vero 2 Clav. ===

This is the first of the hand-crossing, two-part variations; the title means &quot;for one or two manuals&quot;. The movement is written in time. A rapid melodic line predominantly in sixteenth notes is accompanied by another melody with longer note values, which features very wide leaps:

&lt;/score&gt;
The Italian type of hand-crossing such as is frequently found in the sonatas of Scarlatti is employed here, with one hand constantly moving back and forth between high and low registers while the other hand stays in the middle of the keyboard, playing the fast passages.

=== Variatio 6. Canone alla Seconda. a 1 Clav. ===

The sixth variation is a canon at the second: the follower starts a major second higher than the leader. The piece is based on a descending scale and is in time. Kirkpatrick describes this piece as having &quot;an almost nostalgic tenderness&quot;. Each section has an alternate ending to be played on the first and second repeat.

=== Variatio 7. a 1 ô vero 2 Clav. al tempo di Giga ===

The variation is in meter, suggesting several possible Baroque dances. In 1974, when scholars discovered Bach&#x27;s own copy of the first printing of the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;, they noted that over this variation Bach had added the heading &quot;al tempo di Giga&quot;. But the implications of this discovery for modern performance have turned out to be less clear than was at first assumed. In his book &quot;The Keyboard Music of J. S. Bach&quot; the scholar and keyboardist David Schulenberg notes that the discovery &quot;surprised twentieth-century commentators who supposed gigues were always fast and fleeting.&quot; However, &quot;despite the Italian terminology [&quot;giga&quot;], this is a [less fleet] French gigue.&quot; Indeed, he notes, the dotted rhythmic pattern of this variation (pictured) is very similar to that of the gigue from Bach&#x27;s second French suite and the gigue of the &quot;French Overture&quot;. This kind of gigue is known as a &quot;Canary&quot;, based on the rhythm of a dance which originated from the Canary islands.

He concludes, &quot;It need not go quickly.&quot; Moreover, Schulenberg adds that the &quot;numerous short trills and appoggiaturas&quot; preclude too fast a tempo.

The pianist Angela Hewitt, in the liner notes to her 1999 Hyperion recording, argues that by adding the &quot;al tempo di giga&quot; notation, Bach was trying to caution against taking too slow a tempo, and thus turning the dance into a forlane or siciliano. She does however argue, like Schulenberg, that it is a French &quot;gigue&quot;, not an Italian &quot;giga&quot; and does play it at an unhurried tempo.

=== Variatio 8. a 2 Clav. ===

This is another two-part hand-crossing variation, in time. The French style of hand-crossing such as is found in the clavier works of François Couperin is employed, with both hands playing at the same part of the keyboard, one above the other. This is relatively easy to perform on a two-manual harpsichord, but quite difficult to do on a piano.

Most bars feature either a distinctive pattern of eleven sixteenth notes and a sixteenth rest, or ten sixteenth notes and a single eighth note. Large leaps in the melody occur. Both sections end with descending passages in thirty-second notes.

=== Variatio 9. Canone alla Terza. a 1 Clav. ===

This is a canon at the third, in time. The supporting bass line is slightly more active than in the previous canons.

=== Variatio 10. Fughetta. a 1 Clav. ===
Variation 10 is a four-voice fughetta, with a four-bar subject heavily decorated with ornaments and somewhat reminiscent of the opening aria&#x27;s melody.

The exposition takes up the whole first section of this variation (pictured). First the subject is stated in the bass, starting on the G below middle C. The answer (in the tenor) enters in bar 5, but it&#x27;s a tonal answer, so some of the intervals are altered. The soprano voice enters in bar 9, but only keeps the first two bars of the subject intact, changing the rest. The final entry occurs in the alto in bar 13. There is no regular counter-subject in this fugue.
The second section develops using the same thematic material with slight changes. It resembles a counter-exposition: the voices enter one by one, all begin by stating the subject (sometimes a bit altered, like in the first section). The section begins with the subject heard once again, in the soprano voice, accompanied by an active bass line, making the bass part the only exception since it doesn&#x27;t pronounce the subject until bar 25.

=== Variatio 11. a 2 Clav. ===

This is a virtuosic two-part toccata in time. Specified for two manuals, it is largely made up of various scale passages, arpeggios and trills, and features much hand-crossing of different kinds.

=== Variatio 12. a 1 Clav. Canone alla Quarta in moto contrario ===

This is a canon at the fourth in time, of the inverted variety: the follower enters in the second bar in contrary motion to the leader.

In the first section, the left hand accompanies with a bass line written out in repeated quarter notes, in bars 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. This repeated note motif also appears in the first bar of the second section (bar 17, two Ds and a C), and, slightly altered, in bars 22 and 23. In the second section, Bach changes the mood slightly by introducing a few appoggiaturas (bars 19 and 20) and trills (bars 29–30).

=== Variatio 13. a 2 Clav. ===

This variation is a slow, gentle and richly decorated sarabande in time. Most of the melody is written out using thirty-second notes, and ornamented with a few appoggiaturas (more frequent in the second section) and a few mordents. Throughout the piece, the melody is in one voice, and in bars 16 and 24 an interesting effect is produced by the use of an additional voice. Here are bars 15 and 16, the ending of the first section (bar 24 exhibits a similar pattern):

=== Variatio 14. a 2 Clav. ===

This is a rapid two-part hand-crossing toccata in time, with many trills and other ornamentation. It is specified for two manuals and features large jumps between registers. Both features (ornaments and leaps in the melody) are apparent from the first bar: the piece begins with a transition from the G two octaves below middle C, with a lower mordent, to the G two octaves above it with a trill with initial turn.

Bach uses a loose inversion motif between the first half and the second half of this variation, &quot;recycling&quot; rhythmic and melodic material, passing material that was in the right hand to the left hand, and loosely (selectively) inverting it.

Contrasting it with Variation 15, Glenn Gould described this variation as &quot;certainly one of the giddiest bits of neo-Scarlatti-ism imaginable.&quot;

=== Variatio 15. Canone alla Quinta. a 1 Clav.: Andante ===

This is a canon at the fifth in time. Like Variation 12, it is in contrary motion with the leader appearing inverted in the second bar. This is the first of the three variations in G minor, and its melancholic mood contrasts sharply with the playfulness of the previous variation. Pianist Angela Hewitt notes that there is &quot;a wonderful effect at the very end [of this variation]: the hands move away from each other, with the right suspended in mid-air on an open fifth. This gradual fade, leaving us in awe but ready for more, is a fitting end to the first half of the piece.&quot;

Glenn Gould said of this variation, &quot;It&#x27;s the most severe and rigorous and beautiful canon ... the most severe and beautiful that I know, the canon in inversion at the fifth. It&#x27;s a piece so moving, so anguished—and so uplifting at the same time—that it would not be in any way out of place in the St. Matthew&#x27;s Passion; matter of fact, I&#x27;ve always thought of Variation 15 as the perfect Good Friday spell.&quot;

=== Variatio 16. Ouverture. a 1 Clav. ===

The entire set of variations can be seen as being divided into two halves, clearly marked by this grand French overture, commencing with particularly emphatic opening and closing chords. It consists of a slow prelude with dotted rhythms with a following fugue-like contrapuntal section. Here Bach follows his custom of beginning the second half of a major collection with a movement in French style, as with the earlier &quot;Clavier-Übung&quot; volumes, in both parts of the &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, in the &quot;Musical Offering&quot; (#4 of the numbered canons) and in the early version of the &quot;Art of Fugue&quot; (#7 of P 200).

=== Variatio 17. a 2 Clav. ===

This variation is another two-part virtuosic toccata. Peter Williams sees echoes of Antonio Vivaldi and Domenico Scarlatti here. Specified for two manuals, the piece features hand-crossing. It is in time and usually played at a moderately fast tempo. Rosalyn Tureck is one of the very few performers who recorded slow interpretations of the piece. In making his 1981 re-recording of the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;, Glenn Gould considered playing this variation at a slower tempo, in keeping with the tempo of the preceding variation (Variation 16), but ultimately decided not to because &quot;Variation 17 is one of those rather skittish, slightly empty-headed collections of scales and arpeggios which Bach indulged when he wasn&#x27;t writing sober and proper things like fugues and canons, and it just seemed to me that there wasn&#x27;t enough substance to it to warrant such a methodical, deliberate, Germanic tempo.&quot;

=== Variatio 18. Canone alla Sesta. a 1 Clav. ===

This is a canon at the sixth in time. The canonic interplay in the upper voices features many suspensions. Commenting on the structure of the canons of the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;, Glenn Gould cited this variation as the extreme example of &quot;deliberate duality of motivic emphasis ... the canonic voices are called upon to sustain the passacaille role which is capriciously abandoned by the bass.&quot; Nicholas Kenyon calls Variation 18 &quot;an imperious, totally confident movement which must be among the most supremely logical pieces of music ever written, with the strict imitation to the half-bar providing ideal impetus and a sense of climax.&quot;

=== Variatio 19. a 1 Clav. ===

This is a dance-like three-part variation in time. The same sixteenth note figuration is continuously employed and variously exchanged between each of the three voices. This variation incorporates the rhythmic model of variation 13 (complementary exchange of quarter and sixteenth notes) with variations 1 and 2 (syncopations).

=== Variatio 20. a 2 Clav. ===

This variation is a virtuosic two-part toccata in time. Specified for two manuals, it involves rapid hand-crossing. The piece consists mostly of variations on the texture introduced during its first eight bars, where one hand plays a string of eighth notes and the other accompanies by plucking sixteenth notes after each eighth note. To demonstrate this, here are the first two bars of the first section:

»
&lt;/score&gt;

=== Variatio 21. Canone alla Settima ===

The second of the three minor key variations, variation 21 has a tone that is somber or even tragic, which contrasts starkly with variation 20. The bass line here is one of the most eloquent found in the variations, to which Bach adds chromatic intervals that provide tonal shadings. This variation is a canon at the seventh in time; Kenneth Gilbert sees it as an allemande despite the lack of anacrusis. The bass line begins the piece with a low note, proceeds to a slow lament bass and only picks up the pace of the canonic voices in bar 3:

 »
&lt;/score&gt;
A similar pattern, only a bit more lively, occurs in the bass line in the beginning of the second section, which begins with the opening motif inverted.

=== Variatio 22. a 1 Clav. alla breve ===

This variation features four-part writing with many imitative passages and its development in all voices but the bass is much like that of a fugue. The only specified ornament is a trill which is performed on a whole note and which lasts for two bars (11 and 12).

The ground bass on which the entire set of variations is built is heard perhaps most explicitly in this variation (as well as in the Quodlibet) due to the simplicity of the bass voice.

=== Variatio 23. a 2 Clav. ===

Another lively two-part virtuosic variation for two manuals, in time. It begins with the hands chasing one another, as it were: the melodic line, initiated in the left hand with a sharp striking of the G above middle C, and then sliding down from the B one octave above to the F, is offset by the right hand, imitating the left at the same pitch, but a quaver late, for the first three bars, ending with a small flourish in the fourth:
&lt;score&gt;

»
&lt;/score&gt;
This pattern is repeated during bars 5–8, only with the left hand imitating the right one, and the scales are ascending, not descending. We then alternate between hands in short bursts written out in short note values until the last three bars of the first section. The second section starts with this similar alternation in short bursts again, then leads to a dramatic section of alternating thirds between hands. Williams, marvelling at the emotional range of the work, asks: &quot;Can this really be a variation of the same theme that lies behind the adagio no 25?&quot;

=== Variatio 24. Canone all&#x27;Ottava. a 1 Clav. ===

This variation is a canon at the octave, in time. The leader is answered both an octave below and an octave above; it is the only canon of the variations in which the leader alternates between voices in the middle of a section. 

=== Variatio 25. a 2 Clav.: Adagio ===

Variation 25 is the third and last variation in G minor; it is marked adagio in Bach&#x27;s own copy and is in time. The melody is written out predominantly in sixteenth and thirty-second notes, with many chromaticisms. This variation generally lasts longer than any other piece of the set.

Wanda Landowska famously described this variation as &quot;the black pearl&quot; of the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;. Williams writes that &quot;the beauty and dark passion of this variation make it unquestionably the emotional high point of the work&quot;, and Glenn Gould said that &quot;the appearance of this wistful, weary cantilena is a master-stroke of psychology.&quot; In an interview with Gould, Tim Page described this variation as having an &quot;extraordinary chromatic texture&quot;; Gould agreed: &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s been a richer lode of enharmonic relationships any place between Gesualdo and Wagner.&quot;

=== Variatio 26. a 2 Clav. ===

In sharp contrast with the introspective and passionate nature of the previous variation, this piece is another virtuosic two-part toccata, joyous and fast-paced. Underneath the rapid arabesques, this variation is basically a sarabande. Two time signatures are used, for the incessant melody written in sixteenth notes and for the accompaniment in quarter and eighth notes; during the last five bars, both hands play in .

=== Variatio 27. Canone alla Nona. a 2 Clav. ===

Variation 27 is the last canon of the piece, at the ninth and in time. This is the only canon where two manuals are specified not due to hand-crossing difficulties, and the only pure canon of the work, because it does not have a bass line.

=== Variatio 28. a 2 Clav. ===

This variation is a two-part toccata in time that employs a great deal of hand crossing. Trills are written out using thirty-second notes and are present in most of the bars. The piece begins with a pattern in which each hand successively picks out a melodic line while also playing trills. Following this is a section with both hands playing in contrary motion in a melodic contour marked by sixteenth notes (bars 9–12). The end of the first section features trills again, in both hands now and mirroring one another:

&lt;/score&gt;
The second section starts and closes with the contrary motion idea seen in bars 9–12. Most of the closing bars feature trills in one or both hands.

=== Variatio 29. a 1 ô vero 2 Clav. ===

This variation consists mostly of heavy chords alternating with sections of brilliant arpeggios shared between the hands. It is in time. A rather grand variation, it adds an air of resolution after the lofty brilliance of the previous variation. Glenn Gould states that variations 28 and 29 present the only case of &quot;motivic collaboration or extension between successive variations.&quot;

=== Variatio 30. a 1 Clav. Quodlibet ===
The final variation is titled after the &quot;quodlibet&quot; tradition, in which multiple popular songs are played at once or in succession. According to Forkel, the many musicians of the Bach family practiced this tradition at gatherings:

As soon as they were assembled a chorale was first struck up. From this devout beginning they proceeded to jokes which were frequently in strong contrast. That is, they then sang popular songs partly of comic and also partly of indecent content, all mixed together on the spur of the moment. ... This kind of improvised harmonizing they called a Quodlibet, and not only could laugh over it quite whole-heartedly themselves, but also aroused just as hearty and irresistible laughter in all who heard them.

Though Bach never noted the sources of Variation 30, Forkel&#x27;s anecdote led to the belief that it is composed from German Volkslied melodies, as if to evoke the Bach gatherings.

Since folk tunes commonly shared melodies, music alone does not identify the songs intended. For example, part of Variation 30 traces back to the melody of the Italian Bergamask dance, which not only gave rise to compositions by many musicians (such as Dieterich Buxtehude, under the title of &quot;La Capricciosa&quot;, for his thirty-two partite in G major, BuxWV 250), but is even sung to various words in regions such as Iceland today.

A handwritten note found in a collector&#x27;s copy of the &quot;Clavier Ubung&quot; claims that Bach&#x27;s student, Johann Christian Kittel, identified two folk tunes making up Variation 30 by their first lines. Siegfried Dehn of the Prussian royal library later appended purported full texts to this note:
* &quot;Ich bin solang nicht bei dir g&#x27;west, ruck her, ruck her&quot; (&quot;I have so long been away from you, come closer, come closer&quot;) and
* &quot;Kraut und Rüben haben mich vertrieben, hätt mein&#x27; Mutter Fleisch gekocht, wär ich länger blieben&quot; (&quot;Cabbage and turnips have driven me away, had my mother cooked meat, I&#x27;d have opted to stay&quot;), ascribed to the Bergamask theme.

Dehn&#x27;s texts, though unsourced, stand as the only historical evidence for the provenance of Bach&#x27;s Quodlibet and are commonly quoted. Today, the identity of &quot;Kraut und Rüben...&quot; is uncontroversial, since multiple versions of the text, including some explicitly set to the Bergamask theme, are preserved. In contrast, the &quot;Ich bin solang...&quot; text is much more obscure, and these words have not been found in any Volkslied archives.

Other bars of Variation 30 can be heard as incipits of yet more songs, though none have been identified.

=== Aria da Capo ===

A note-for-note repeat of the aria at the beginning. Williams writes that the work&#x27;s &quot;elusive beauty ... is reinforced by this return to the Aria. ... no such return can have a neutral &quot;Affekt&quot;. Its melody is made to stand out by what has gone on in the last five variations, and it is likely to appear wistful or nostalgic or subdued or resigned or sad, heard on its repeat as something coming to an end, the same notes but now final.&quot;

== Canons on the Goldberg ground, BWV 1087 ==

When Bach&#x27;s personal copy of the printed edition of the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; (see above) was discovered in 1974, it was found to include an appendix in the form of fourteen canons built on the first eight bass notes from the aria. It is speculated that the number 14 refers to the ordinal values of the letters in the composer&#x27;s name: B(2) + A(1) + C(3) + H(8) = 14. Among those canons, the eleventh and the thirteenth are first versions of BWV 1077 and BWV 1076; the latter is included in the famous portrait of Bach painted by Elias Gottlob Haussmann in 1746.

== Transcribed and popularized versions ==
The &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; has been reworked freely by many performers, changing either the instrumentation, the notes, or both. The Italian composer Busoni prepared a greatly altered transcription for piano. According to the art critic Michael Kimmelman, &quot;Busoni shuffled the variations, skipping some, then added his own rather voluptuous coda to create a three-movement structure; each movement has a distinct, arcing shape, and the whole becomes a more tightly organized drama than the original.&quot; Other arrangements include:

* 1883: Josef Rheinberger, transcription (tr.) for two pianos, Op. 3 (rev. Max Reger)
* 1912: Karl Eichler, tr. for piano four hands
* 1938: Józef Koffler, tr. for orchestra / string orchestra
