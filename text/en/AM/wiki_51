<text>Mount Ephraim (), or alternatively Mount of Ephraim, was the historical name for the central mountainous district of Israel once alloted by the Tribe of Ephraim (), extending from Bethel to the plain of Jezreel. In Joshua&#x27;s time (), approximately sometime between the 18th century BCE and the 13th century BCE, these hills were densely wooded. They were intersected by well-watered, fertile valleys, referred to in .

Later, the region became known as Samaria, after the capital city of the northern Kingdom of Israel which was centered in the area.

== Notable persons ==
Joshua was buried at Timnath-heres among the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash (). This region is also called the &quot;mountains of Israel&quot; () and the &quot;mountains of Samaria&quot; (: ).

Israel&#x27;s fourth judge and prophetess Deborah lived in this region. Her home was called &quot;the palm tree of Deborah&quot;, and was between Bethel and Ramah in Benjamin ().

&#x27;Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel. And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:(Ephraim was the new king after the pass of the King of Solomon.)

<text>Chaosnet is a local area network technology. It was first developed by Thomas Knight and Jack Holloway at MIT&#x27;s AI Lab in 1975 and thereafter. It refers to two separate, but closely related, technologies. The more widespread was a set of computer communication packet-based protocols intended to connect the then-recently developed and very popular (within MIT) Lisp machines; the second was one of the earliest local area network (LAN) hardware implementations.

==Origin==
The Chaosnet protocol originally used an implementation over CATV coaxial cable modeled on the early Xerox PARC Ethernet, the early ARPANET, and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It was a contention-based system intended to work over a range, that included a pseudo-slotted feature intended to reduce collisions, which worked by passing a virtual token of permission from host to host; successful packet transmissions updated each host&#x27;s knowledge of which host had the token at that time. Collisions caused a host to fall silent for a duration depending on the distance from the host it collided with. Collisions were never a real problem, and the pseudo-slotting fell into disuse.

Chaosnet&#x27;s network topology was usually series of linear (not circular) cables, each up to a maximum of a kilometer and roughly 12 clients. The individual segments were interconnected by &quot;bridges&quot; (much in the ARPANET mold), generally older computers like PDP-11s with two network interfaces.

The protocols were also later implemented as a payload that could be carried over Ethernet (usually the later variety). Chaosnet was specifically for LANs; features to support WANs were left out for the sake of simplicity.

Chaosnet can be regarded as a contemporary of both the PUP protocols invented by PARC, and the Internet Protocol (IP), and was recognized as one of the other network classes (other than &quot;IN&quot; and &quot;HS&quot;) in the Domain Name System. BIND uses a built-in pseudo-top-level-domain in the &quot;CHAOS class&quot; for retrieving information about a running DNS server.

==Chaosnet protocol==
The Chaosnet protocol identifies hosts by 16-bit addresses, 8 bits of which identify the subnet, 8 bits of which identify the host within the subnet. The basic protocol was a full-duplex reliable packet transmission between two user processes. The packet contents could be treated as bytes of 8 or 16 bits, with support for other word sizes provided by higher-level protocols. The connection was identified by a combination of the 16-bit addresses of each host and a 16-bit &quot;connection index&quot; assigned by each host to maintain uniqueness. &quot;Controlled&quot; packets within a connection were identified by a 16-bit packet number, which was used to deliver controlled packets reliably and in order, with re-transmission and flow control. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; packets were not retransmitted, and were used at a lower level to support the flow-control and re-transmission. Chaosnet also supported &quot;BRD&quot; broadcast packets to multiple subnets.

Initial establishment of the connection was made using &quot;contact names.&quot; These names identified the network service and higher-level protocol. For example, &quot;STATUS&quot; was the contact name which requested basic network statistics from a host. &quot;TELNET&quot; was a contact name for the Arpanet TELNET protocol. &quot;FILE&quot; was a contact name for the Lisp Machine network file service. Other contact names included &quot;SUPDUP&quot;, &quot;MAIL&quot;, &quot;NAME&quot; for the Arpanet Finger protocol, &quot;TIME&quot;, &quot;SEND&quot; for interactive messaging, &quot;ARPA&quot; for a gateway service to Arpanet. &quot;DOVER&quot; was the contact name for sending print jobs to Chaosnet hosts with a Xerox Dover printer attached (an early laser printer). Developers could easily experiment with new protocols by inventing new contact names. In ITS, a new server for that protocol could be installed by creating a link to the program in the location DSK:DEVICE;CHAOS &lt;cname&gt; where &lt;cname&gt; was up to six letters of the contact name.

Simple transactions could be completed by a single &quot;RFC&quot; packet containing a contact name, answered by a single &quot;ANS&quot; packet with the relevant information. For example, an RFC to contact name &quot;TIME&quot; would result in a single ANS packet containing a 32-bit number indicating the time.
The original GNU Manifesto mentioned that it aimed to, among other things, support the Chaosnet protocol.

Symbolics, a maker of the Lisp machines, licensed the MIT Chaosnet hardware and software implementation from the CADR computer design.

<text>Moriah (Hebrew: , &quot;Mōrīyya&quot;; Arabic: ﻣﺮﻭﻩ, &quot;Marwah&quot;) is the name given to a region in the Book of Genesis, where the binding of Isaac by Abraham is said to have taken place. Jews identify the region mentioned in Genesis and the specific mountain in which the near-sacrifice is said to have occurred with &quot;Mount Moriah&quot;, mentioned in the Book of Chronicles as the place where Solomon&#x27;s Temple is said to have been built, and both these locations are also identified with the current Temple Mount in Jerusalem. The Samaritan Torah, on the other hand, transliterates the place mentioned for the binding of Isaac as Moreh, a name for the region near modern-day Nablus. It is believed by the Samaritans that the near-sacrifice actually took place on Mount Gerizim, near Nablus in the West Bank.

Many Muslims, in turn, believe the place mentioned in the first book of the Bible, rendered as Marwa in Arabic in the Quran, is actually located close to the Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. There has been a historical account of rams&#x27; horns preserved in the Kaaba until the year 683, which are believed to be the remains of the sacrifice of Ishmael – the first son of Abraham, who most Muslims believe was the son Abraham tied down and almost sacrificed, and not Isaac.

==Biblical references==
In the Jewish Bible, &quot;Moriyya&quot; and/or &quot;Moriah&quot; () occur twice, with differences of spelling between different manuscripts. Tradition has interpreted these two as the same place:

* Genesis: &quot;Then God said, &#x27;Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriyya. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.
* 2 Chronicles: &quot;Then Solomon began to build the temple of the in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah, where the had appeared to his father David. It was on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, the place provided by David.&quot;

==Speculation and debate==
Whereas the mention of Moriah in Genesis could be referring to any mountainous region, the book of Chronicles says that the location of Araunah&#x27;s threshing floor is on &quot;Mount Moriah&quot; and that the Temple of Solomon was built over Araunah&#x27;s threshing floor. This has led to the classical rabbinical supposition that the Moriah region mentioned in Genesis as the place where Abraham almost sacrificed Isaac was in Jerusalem. 

In consequence of these traditions, Classical Rabbinical Literature theorised that the name was a (linguistically corrupted) reference to the Temple, suggesting translations like &quot;the teaching-place&quot; (referring to the Sanhedrin that met there), &quot;the place of fear&quot; (referring to the supposed fear that non-Israelites would have at the Temple), &quot;the place of myrrh&quot; (referring to the spices burnt as incense). On the other hand, some interpretations of a biblical passage concerning Melchizedek, king of Salem, would indicate Jerusalem was already a city with a priest at the time of Abraham, and thus is unlikely to have been founded on the lonely spot where Abraham tried to sacrifice Isaac.

There is also debate as to whether the two references to Moriyya/Moriah (Genesis 22:2 and 2 Chronicles 3:1) are correctly understood as the same name. Ancient translators seem to have interpreted them differently: whereas all ancient translations simply transliterated the name in Chronicles, in Genesis they tended to try to understand the literal meaning of the name and to translate it. For example, in the Greek Septuagint translation, these verses are translated as:

* Genesis 22:2: &quot;And he said, Take thy son, the beloved one, whom thou hast loved—Isaac, and go into the high land (Koine Greek: ), and offer him there for a whole-burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.&quot;
* 2 Chronicles 3:1: &quot;And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem in the mount of Amoria, where the Lord appeared to his father David, in the place which David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.&quot;

Moreover, other ancient translations interpret the instance in Genesis in different ways from the Septuagint:
* The Samaritan Pentateuch spells the name differently from the Hebrew-alphabet text, giving ’ereṣ hammôrā’āh&quot;, which seems to interpret the name as coming from the root &quot;rā’āh&quot; (&quot;to see&quot;), and accordingly means &quot;the land of vision&quot;. Correspondingly, Symmachus&#x27;s Greek translation renders the Genesis place-name as &quot;tês optasías&quot; (&quot;into the land of appearance/manifestation&quot;) and Jerome&#x27;s Latin Vulgate similarly says &quot;in terram Visionis&quot; (&quot;into the land of Vision&quot;). Forming a religion closely related to Judaism, Samaritans disagree with the Jewish view that the binding of Isaac took place in the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, claiming instead that it happened in Mount Gerizim in the West Bank.
* Targum Pseudo-Jonathan interprets the name as &quot;land of worship&quot;.

Some modern biblical scholars, however, regard the name as a reference to the Amorites, having lost the initial &quot;a&quot; via aphesis; the name is thus interpreted as meaning &quot;land of the Amorites&quot;. This agrees with the Septuagint, where, for example, 2 Chronicles 3:1 refers to the location as . Some scholars also identify it with Moreh, the location near Shechem at which Abraham built an altar, according to Genesis 12:6. Hence a number of scholars believe that the &quot;&quot; mentioned in Genesis actually refers to a hill near Shechem, supporting the Samaritan belief that the near-sacrifice of Isaac occurred on Mount Gerizim – a location near Shechem.

<doc id="69729" wikidata="Q1092415" url="?curid=69729" title="Givat HaMoreh">
<text>Givat HaMoreh (, ) is a hill in northern Israel on the northeast side of the Jezreel Valley. The highest peak reaches an altitude of , while the bottom of the Jezreel Valley is situated at an altitude of . North of it are the plains of the Lower Galilee and Mount Tabor. To the east, Giv&#x27;at HaMoreh connects to the Issachar Plateau. To the southeast it descends into the Harod Valley, where the &#x27;Ain Jalut flows eastwards into the Jordan Valley.

==Etymology==
For the Hebrew name several possible origins have been discussed. One is &quot;yoreh&quot;, &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;shoots&quot; or &quot;teacher&quot;, a name used for a specific rain in the parasha Eikev () and in the Twelve Minor Prophets (), the first one of the annual rainy season in the Land of Israel. A second is &quot;high place&quot;, as the hill does indeed dominate the surrounding valleys. A third is based on the meaning of &quot;teacher&quot; for the Hebrew &quot;moreh&quot;, interpreted as a local holy man who could foretell the future. One can also think of a holy man living on Givat HaMoreh who could bring about rain, or of a rainmaking cult once practiced at the site.
In the 3rd century BCE, the name was translated into Koine Greek as , &quot;Gabaath Amora&quot;.

Christian pilgrims, starting with the Middle Ages, sometimes named the hill &quot;Little Hermon&quot; in connection to , &quot;Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name&quot;, considering that Givat HaMore is close to Mount Tabor, much more so than Mount Hermon.

In Arabic, the hill is known as &quot;Mount Dahi&quot; (Jebel ed-Dahi), after the Muslim shrine (&quot;maqam&quot;) of Dihyah al-Kalbi situated at its top and housing the tomb of this seventh-century saint.

==History==
===Hebrew Bible===
The &quot;hill of Moreh&quot; is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible three times, in , and Judges 7:1.

The Hebrew phrase &quot;elon moreh&quot; () has been subject to various translations in English versions of the Bible. Translators who consider &quot;elon moreh&quot; to be the name of a locality, render it as &quot;the plain(s) of Moreh&quot;, e.g. King James Version and the Geneva Bible, but translators who consider the term to refer to a sacred tree or grove often render it as &quot;terebinth&quot; (&quot;Pistacia terebinthus&quot;), a tree which is notable for its size and age in dry landscapes of the region. For example, the New International Version translation of Genesis 12:6a reads:
:&quot;Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem&quot;
and the New King James Version translates Deuteronomy 11:30 as:
:&quot;Are they (Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal) not on the other side of the Jordan, toward the setting sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal, beside the terebinth trees of Moreh?&quot;

&quot;Moreh&quot; is often understood to mean &quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;oracle&quot;, referring to the owner of the tree or the land on which it grew.

Genesis 35:4:
:&quot;And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which [were] in their hand, and [all their] earrings which [were] in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which [was] by Shechem.&quot;
A neutral reading discovers that the tree, oak or not, grew above buried idols and dedicated treasure, the Hebrews remembered, and they associated the burial of these things with the patriarchal age.

John Wesley noted that the plains of Moreh was one of the first places that Abram came to in Canaan, so when Moses sent the incoming Israelites to this place &quot;to hear the blessing and the curse, they were minded of the promise made to Abram in that very place&quot;.

===Ottoman period===
A 19th-century travelogue identifies Moreh as Nebi Dahi, south of Mount Tabor.

===British Mandate and State of Israel===
In the 20th century, in the valley below the mountain, the city of Afula (est. 1925) was developed as the main Jewish center of the region. Afula gradually expanded from the plains to the slopes of Giv&#x27;at ha-Moreh. During the War of Independence in 1948, the area was completely dominated by Israeli forces, but local Arab population was not displaced. The Arab villages of Dahi and Nein are located on the slope.

On the central part of Giv&#x27;at ha-Moreh there is a nature reserve, partly wooded developed by the Jewish National Fund. The Nazareth Iris blooms here in spring.

<text>HMS &quot;Hampshire&quot; was one of six armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet upon completion. After a refit, she was assigned to the reserve Third Fleet in 1909 before going to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1911. She was transferred to the China Station in 1912 and remained there until the start of the First World War in August 1914.

The ship hunted for German commerce raiders until she was transferred to the Grand Fleet at the end of 1914. She was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron upon her return home. She was transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in 1916 and was present at the Battle of Jutland. Several days later, on 5 June, she was sailing to Arkhangelsk, Russia, carrying the Secretary of State for War, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, when she is believed to have struck a mine laid by a German submarine. She sank with 737 of 749 people aboard killed, including Kitchener and his staff. Rumours later circulated of German spies and sabotage being involved in the sinking. Her wreck is listed under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, though parts were later salvaged. Several films have been made exploring the circumstances of her loss.

==Design and description==
&quot;Hampshire&quot; was designed to displace . The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by seventeen Yarrow and six cylindrical boilers. She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 610 officers and ratings.

Her main armament consisted of four breech-loading (BL) Mk I guns mounted in four single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure and one on each side. The guns fired their shells to a range of about . Her secondary armament of six BL Mk VII guns was arranged in casemates amidships. Four of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather. They had a maximum range of approximately with their shells. &quot;Hampshire&quot; also carried 18 quick-firing (QF) 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged  torpedo tubes. Her two 12-pounder 8 cwt guns could be dismounted for service ashore.

At some point in the First World War, the main deck six-inch guns of the &quot;Devonshire&quot;-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve seakeeping and the four 3-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were landed.

The ship&#x27;s waterline armour belt had a maximum thickness of and was closed off by transverse bulkheads. The armour of the gun turrets was also five inches thick, whilst that of their barbettes was six inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by of armour.

==Construction and service==
&quot;Hampshire&quot;, named to commemorate the English county, was laid down by Armstrong Whitworth at their Elswick shipyard on 1 September 1902 and launched on 24 September 1903. She was completed on 15 July 1905 and was initially assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet together with most of her sister ships. She began a refit at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in December 1908 and was then assigned to the reserve Third Fleet in August 1909. She recommissioned in December 1911 for her assignment with the 6th Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet and was transferred to the China Station in 1912.

===First World War===
When the war began, she was in Wei Hai Wei, and was assigned to the small squadron led by Vice Admiral Martyn Jerram, commander-in-chief of the China Station. She was ordered to destroy the German radio station at Yap together with the armoured cruiser and the light cruiser . &quot;En route&quot;, the ships captured the collier on 11 August and sank her; &quot;Hampshire&quot; was too short on coal by then to make the island so Jerram ordered her back to Hong Kong with the crew of the &quot;Elspeth&quot;. At the end of the month, she was ordered down to the Dutch East Indies to search for any German ships at sea, narrowly missing the German light cruiser . The German ship had not been reported since the war began and she sailed into the Bay of Bengal and began preying upon unsuspecting British shipping beginning on 14 September. &quot;Hampshire&quot; was ordered there to search for &quot;Emden&quot; and remained there through October and November, together with the armed merchant cruiser , looking for the raider until she was destroyed on 9 November by . &quot;Hampshire&quot; then escorted an ANZAC troop convoy through the Indian Ocean and Red Sea to Egypt. &quot;Hampshire&quot; was refitted in Gibraltar in December before returning home to serve with the Grand Fleet. She was assigned the 7th Cruiser Squadron in January 1915 and was detached in November to escort shipping in the White Sea. She returned home in time to participate in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916 with the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. During the battle, she was never actually engaged and only fired four salvos at the German II Scouting Group that fell well short of their targets, in addition to shooting at illusory submarine periscopes throughout the day.

===Last voyage and sinking===
Immediately after the battle, she was ordered to carry Lord Kitchener from Scapa Flow on a diplomatic mission to Russia via the port of Arkhangelsk. Due to the gale-force conditions, it was decided that &quot;Hampshire&quot; would sail through the Pentland Firth, then turn north along the western coast of the Orkney Islands. This course would provide a lee from the strong winds, allowing escorting destroyers to keep pace with her. She departed Scapa Flow at 16:45 and about an hour later rendezvoused with her two escorts, the destroyers and . As the ships turned to the northwest, the gale increased and shifted direction so that the ships were facing it head on. This caused the destroyers to fall behind &quot;Hampshire&quot;. As it was considered unlikely that enemy submarines would be active in such conditions, &quot;Hampshire&quot;&#x27;s Captain Savill ordered &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Victor&quot; to return to Scapa Flow.

Sailing alone in heavy seas, &quot;Hampshire&quot; was approximately off Mainland in the Orkney Islands between Brough of Birsay and Marwick Head at 19:40 on 5 June when an explosion occurred and she heeled to starboard. She had struck one of several mines laid by the German minelaying submarine &quot;U-75&quot; on 28–29 May, just before the Battle of Jutland. The detonation had holed the cruiser between bows and bridge, and the lifeboats were smashed against the side of the ship by the heavy seas when they were lowered. About 15 minutes after the explosion, &quot;Hampshire&quot; sank by the bow. Of the 735 crewmembers and 14 passengers aboard, only 12 crew survived after coming ashore on three Carley floats. A total of 737 were lost, including Kitchener and all the members of the mission to Russia. The sinking happened 12 miles north of the nearest Lifeboat Station at Stromness. There is speculation whether lifeboat intervention would have made any difference given the conditions, but the lifeboat was never called out.

Fritz Joubert Duquesne – a Boer and German spy – claimed to have assumed the identity of Russian Count Boris Zakrevsky and joined Kitchener in Scotland. Duquesne supposedly signalled a German U-boat shortly after departing Scapa Flow to alert them that Kitchener&#x27;s ship was approaching. He was then rescued by the submarine as &quot;Hampshire&quot; sank. In the 1930s and 1940s, he ran the Duquesne Spy Ring and was captured by the FBI along with 32 other Nazi agents in the largest espionage conviction in U.S. history.

====Wreck====

The wreck is designated as a controlled site under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 at coordinates and diving is forbidden without a licence. The ship is upside down at a depth of of water.

==Memorials==

In 1983, one propeller and part of &quot;Hampshire&quot;″s drive shaft were salvaged from the wreck. They are now on view at the Scapa Flow Visitor Centre and Museum, Lyness, Hoy, Orkney. Three Vickers 3 Pounder Mk II Quick-Firing deck guns were also salvaged from the wreck. In 2021, one of these was restored to its original condition by specialist conservators in Alloa, and is now on display in the foyer of the museum.

The 737 &quot;Hampshire&quot; dead are commemorated on the right-hand side of the base at the &quot;Hampshire, Isle of Wight and Winchester War Memorial&quot; outside Winchester Cathedral.

A tower was erected on Marwick Head on Mainland, Orkney, in 1926 by the people of Orkney to the memory of Kitchener and the officers and men of &quot;Hampshire&quot;. The Kitchener Memorial is a square, crenellated stone tower with the following inscription:
==Media==
The sinking of the ship and the events surrounding Kitchener&#x27;s death are portrayed in the 1921 film &quot;How Kitchener Was Betrayed&quot;, the 1969 film &quot;Fraulein Doktor&quot; about a female spy, and the 2021 film &quot;The King&#x27;s Man&quot;, a prequel to 2015&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

<text>Mordecai (; also Mordechai; , IPA: ) is one of the main personalities in the Book of Esther in the Hebrew Bible. He is described in &quot;Tanna Devei Eliyahu&quot; as being the son of Jair, of the tribe of Benjamin and member of the Sanhedrin. Mordecai was also the cousin and guardian of Esther, who became queen of Persia under the reign of Ahasuerus (Xerxes I). Mordecai&#x27;s loyalty and bravery are highlighted in the story as he helps Esther foil the plot of Haman, the king&#x27;s vizier, to exterminate the Jewish people. His story is celebrated in the Jewish holiday of Purim, which commemorates his victory.

One theory frequently discussed in scholarship suggests that the Book of Esther serves as an etiology for Purim, with Mordecai and Esther representing the Babylonian gods Marduk and Ishtar in a historicized Babylonian myth or ritual. The identification of Mordecai in the Book of Esther with a Persian official named “Marduka” mentioned in an inscription from the reign of Xerxes is debated, with some scholars supporting the connection while others find it unconvincing due to the commonality of the name.

== Biblical account ==

Mordecai resided in Susa (Shushan or Shoushan), the metropolis of Persia (now Iran). He adopted his orphaned cousin (Esther 2:7), Hadassah (Esther), whom he brought up as if she were his own daughter. When &quot;young virgins&quot; were sought, she was taken into the presence of King Ahasuerus and was made queen in the place of the exiled queen Vashti. Subsequently, Mordecai discovered a plot of the king&#x27;s chamberlains Bigthan and Teresh to assassinate the king. Because of Mordecai&#x27;s vigilance, the plot was foiled.

Haman the Agagite had been raised to the highest position at court. In spite of the king&#x27;s decree that all should prostrate themselves before Haman, Mordecai refused to do so. Haman, stung by Mordecai&#x27;s refusal, resolved to kill not only Mordecai but all Jewish exiles throughout the Persian empire, and won the king&#x27;s permission to carry out his plan. Mordecai communicated Haman&#x27;s scheme to Queen Esther, who used her favor with the king to reverse the scheme, leading the king to authorize Jews to kill their enemies, which they did. 

During all this, the king had happened to learn of Mordecai&#x27;s service in foiling the assassination plot and had asked Haman how a person who did a great service to the king should be honored. Haman answered, thinking the question was about him; and the king followed this advice, and honored Mordecai, and eventually made Mordecai his chief advisor. Haman was executed on gallows that he had set up for Mordecai. The feast of Purim celebrates these reversals of fortune.

== History ==
===Book of Esther===
Although the details of the setting are entirely plausible and the story may even have some basis in actual events, some think that the book of Esther is a novella rather than history. Persian kings did not marry outside of seven Persian noble families, making it unlikely that there was a Jewish queen Esther, and in any case the historical Xerxes&#x27;s queen was Amestris.

There is general agreement that the story was created to justify the Jewish appropriation of an originally non-Jewish feast. The festival which the book explains is purim, which is explained as meaning &quot;lot&quot;, from the Babylonian word &quot;puru&quot;. There are wide-ranging theories regarding the origin of Purim: one popular theory says festival has its origins in a historicized Babylonian myth or ritual in which Mordecai and Esther represent the Babylonian gods Marduk and Ishtar, others trace the ritual to the Persian New Year, and scholars have surveyed other theories in their works. Some scholars have defended the story as real history, but others have said the attempt to find a historical kernel to the narrative &quot;is likely to be futile&quot;.

=== Name ===
The name &quot;Mordecai&quot; is of uncertain origin but is considered identical to the name &quot;Marduka&quot; or &quot;Marduku&quot; (), attested as the name of up to four Persian court officials in thirty texts (the Persepolis Administrative Archives) from the period of Xerxes I and his father Darius.

The Talmud (&quot;Menachot&quot; 64b and 65a) relates that his full name was &quot;Mordechai Bilshan&quot; (which occurs in Ezra 2:2 and Nehemiah 7:7, albeit likely as two &quot;separate&quot; names in sequence). Hoschander interpreted this as the Babylonian &quot;Marduk-belshunu&quot; (𒀭𒀫𒌓𒂗𒋗𒉡, dAMAR.UTU-EN-&quot;šu&quot;-&quot;nu&quot;, meaning &quot;Marduk is their lord&quot;) &quot;Mordecai&quot; being thus a hypocorism.

In the King James Version of the deuterocanonical Greek additions to Esther, his name is spelled as Mardocheus, which may better preserve the original vowels, though the Masoretic Text versions of the Persian names in the Bible are known to be the most reliable.

=== Age ===

Esther 2:5-6 contains a short snippet of Mordecai&#x27;s genealogical history, generally translated as, &quot;Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jeconiah king of Judah&quot;. The wording of the passage lends to two conclusions: either that Mordecai (the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish) was carried into exile by Nebuchadnezzar, or that his ancestor Kish was the one carried into exile.

The Pentecostal minister Finis Dake interprets the Bible verses Esther 2:5–6 to mean that Mordecai himself was exiled by Nebuchadnezzar. Biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan discusses this as an inaccuracy regarding Mordecai&#x27;s age. If &quot;who had been carried into exile&quot; refers to Mordecai, he would have had been more than 100 years old during the events described in the Book of Esther (assuming the biblical Ahasuerus is indeed Xerxes I). However, the verse may be read as referring not to Mordecai&#x27;s exile to Babylon, but to his great-grandfather Kish&#x27;s exile — a reading which many accept.

=== Genealogy ===

The Targum Sheni gives his genealogy in more detail, as follows: &quot;Mordecai, son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Shemida, son of Ba&#x27;anah, son of Elah, son of Micah, son of Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan, son of Saul, son of Kish, son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Bechorath, son of Aphiah, son of Shecharim, son of Uzziah, son of Sason, son of Michael, son of Eliel, son of Amihud, son of Shephatiah, son of Penuel, son of Petah, son of Melokh, son of Yerubaal, son of Yeruham, son of Hananiah, son of Zabdi, son of Elpa&#x27;al, son of Shimri, son of Zebadiah, son of Rimoth, son of Khashum, son of Shekhorah, son of Gazza, son of &#x27;Uzza, son of Gera, son of Bela, son of Benjamin, son of Jacob the firstborn, whose name is called Israel.&quot; The same genealogy is inscribed on a massive metal tablet in the Tomb of Esther and Mordechai (pictured). 

This traditional genealogy implicates Kish as the name of an ancient ancestor and not simply Mordecai&#x27;s great-grandfather, meaning that Esther 2:5—6 was interpreted as &quot;Mordecai&quot; being the one who was exiled to Babylon. The chronological inconsistencies of this assumption are detailed above.

== Prophet status ==
The Talmud lists Esther as a prophet. Some talmudic scholars such as Nachman b. Yaakov have suggested that Mordecai is the Biblical prophet Malachi, but this argument is rejected by consensus and certain interpretations of the Talmud.

Mordecai&#x27;s genealogy in the second chapter of the Book of Esther is given as a descendant of a Benjaminite named Kish. As &quot;Kish&quot; was also the name of the father of King Saul, another Benjaminite, the Talmud accords Mordecai the status of a descendant of the first King of Israel.

<doc id="69740" wikidata="Q1543201" url="?curid=69740" title="TSR, Inc.">
<text>TSR, Inc. was an American game publishing company, best known as the original publisher of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;). Its earliest incarnation, Tactical Studies Rules, was founded in October 1973 by Gary Gygax and Don Kaye. Gygax had been unable to find a publisher for &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, a new type of game he and Dave Arneson were co-developing, so he founded the new company with Kaye to self-publish their products. Needing financing to bring their new game to market, Gygax and Kaye brought in Brian Blume in December as an equal partner. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is generally considered the first tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG), and established the genre. When Kaye died suddenly in 1975, the Tactical Studies Rules partnership restructured into TSR Hobbies, Inc. and accepted investment from Blume&#x27;s father Melvin. With the popular &quot;D&amp;D&quot; as its main product, TSR Hobbies became a major force in the games industry by the late 1970s. Melvin Blume eventually transferred his shares to his other son Kevin, making the two Blume brothers the largest shareholders in TSR Hobbies.

TSR Hobbies ran into financial difficulties in the spring of 1983, prompting the company to split into four independent businesses, with game publishing and development continuing as TSR, Inc. (TSR). After losing their executive positions, the Blume brothers subsequently sold their shares to TSR Vice President Lorraine Williams, who in turn engineered Gygax&#x27;s ouster from the company in October 1985. TSR saw prosperity under Williams, but encountered financial trouble in the mid-1990s. While their overall sales and revenue were healthy, TSR&#x27;s high costs meant the company nevertheless became unprofitable and deeply in debt. TSR was left unable to cover its publishing costs due to a variety of factors. Facing insolvency, TSR was purchased in 1997 by Wizards of the Coast (WotC). WotC initially continued using the TSR name for &quot;D&amp;D&quot; products, but by 2000, the TSR moniker was dropped, coinciding with the release of the 3rd edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

WotC allowed the TSR trademark to expire in the early 2000s. Two other companies have since used the TSR trademark commercially.

==History==
===Tactical Studies Rules (1973–1975)===
Tactical Studies Rules (TSR) was formed in 1973 as a partnership between Gary Gygax and Don Kaye, who collected together $2,400 for costs related to startup, to formally publish and sell the rules of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, the creation of Gygax and Dave Arneson and the first modern role-playing game (RPG). The first TSR release, however, was &quot;Cavaliers and Roundheads&quot;, a miniature game, to start generating income for TSR. The partnership was subsequently joined by Brian Blume in December 1973. Blume was admitted to the partnership to fund further publishing of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, as &quot;Cavaliers and Roundheads&quot; was not a commercial success. In the original configuration of the partnership, Kaye served as president, Blume as vice-president, and Gygax as editor.

In January 1974, TSR—with Gygax using his basement as a headquarters—produced 1,000 copies of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, selling them for $10 each (and the required extra dice for another $3.50). This first print sold out in 10 months. In January 1975, TSR printed a second batch of 1,000 copies of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, which took only another five or six months to sell out. Also in 1974, TSR published &quot;Warriors of Mars&quot;, a miniatures rules book set in the fantasy world of Barsoom, originally imagined by Edgar Rice Burroughs in his series of novels about John Carter of Mars, to which Gygax paid homage in the preface of the first edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. However, Gygax and TSR published the &quot;Mars&quot; book without permission from (or payment to) the Burroughs estate. &quot;Warriors of Mars&quot; was quietly dropped from the catalog and never reprinted.
When Don Kaye died of a heart attack on January 31, 1975, his role was taken over by his wife Donna Kaye, who remained responsible for accounting, shipping, and the records of the partnership through the summer. By the summer of 1975, those duties became complex enough that Gygax himself became a full-time employee of the partnership in order to take them over from Donna Kaye. Arneson also entered the partnership in order to coordinate research and design with his circle in the Twin Cities.

===TSR Hobbies, Inc. (1975–1983)===
Brian Blume and Gary Gygax reorganized the business from a partnership to a corporation called TSR Hobbies, Inc. At first, it was a separate company to market miniatures and games from other companies, an enterprise which was also connected to the opening of the Dungeon hobby shop in Lake Geneva. TSR Hobbies then moved to buy out the old TSR partnership&#x27;s assets. Brian&#x27;s father, Melvin Blume, invested $20,000 in the nascent company which enabled it to buy out Donna Kaye&#x27;s share of the original TSR partnership. On September 26, 1975, the assets of the former partnership were transferred to TSR Hobbies. Brian Blume became the largest shareholder, Melvin Blume the second largest, and Gary Gygax the third largest. Gygax served as president of TSR Hobbies, and Blume as vice president and secretary. The Dungeon hobby shop would become the effective headquarters of the company, including the offices of Blume and Gygax. TSR Hobbies subcontracted the printing and assembly work in October 1975, and the third printing of 2,000 copies of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; sold out in five months. Tim Kask was hired in the autumn of 1975 as Periodicals Editor, and the first employee that TSR hired for full-time work.

&quot;Empire of the Petal Throne&quot; was the first game product released by TSR Hobbies, followed by two &quot;D&amp;D&quot; supplements, &quot;Greyhawk&quot; and &quot;Blackmoor&quot;. Also released in 1975 were the board game &quot;Dungeon!&quot; and the Wild West RPG &quot;Boot Hill&quot;. The company took $300,000 in revenues for the fiscal year of 1976. TSR started hosting the Gen Con Game Fair in 1976, and the first &quot;D&amp;D&quot; open tournament was held at the convention that year. &quot;D&amp;D&quot; supplements &quot;Eldritch Wizardry&quot; and &quot;Gods, Demi-Gods &amp; Heroes&quot; were released in 1976. Also in 1976, the company opened The Dungeon Hobby Shop at 723 Williams Street and TSR Hobbies moved out of Gygax&#x27;s home and into the building, with its offices upstairs from the hobby shop.

TSR also began to branch the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; product into two: &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; as a general audience product intended for novices, and &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) for a more complicated product aimed at hardcore fans. In 1977, the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set&quot; was released for &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, and the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was released as the initial product for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, making TSR the first game company to publish a hardbound book. The next year, the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; &quot;Players Handbook&quot; was published, followed by a series of six adventure modules. Due to the inclusion of the word &quot;Advanced&quot; in the title, TSR did not pay Dave Arneson any royalties on &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; products, saying his co-creation rights extended to the base &quot;D&amp;D&quot; name only. In late 1978, TSR Hobbies and the Dungeon Hobby Shop moved from 723 Williams Street into downtown Lake Geneva, to 772 West Main Street, with its offices once again located above the hobby shop. In 1979, the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot; was published, and radio ads featuring &quot;Morley the Wizard&quot; were broadcast, a figure created &quot;as the poster child for the softer, child-friendly image&quot; promoted at that time. All of these core books would go on to be major hits; the &quot;D&amp;D Basic Set&quot; sold well in 1977 and 1978, would sell over 100,000 copies in 1979, and would continue to be updated and re-released for years.

During this era, there were a number of competitors and unofficial supplements to &quot;D&amp;D&quot; published, arguably in violation of TSR&#x27;s copyright, which many &quot;D&amp;D&quot; players used alongside the TSR books. Among these were the &quot;Arduin Grimoire&quot;, the &quot;Manual of Aurenia&quot;, and variants such as &quot;Warlock&quot; and &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot;. TSR regarded these very warily, and in cases where they felt their trademarks were being misused, they issued cease-and-desist letters. More often than not, this legal posturing resulted in only slight changes to competitors&#x27; works, but caused significant animosity in the community.

In 1979, TSR signed a contract with Random House with unusual terms. In most deals between publishers and distributors, publishers are paid directly based on books sold downstream by the distributor to bookstores. In TSR&#x27;s contract, however, Random House would loan money to TSR as an advance upon shipment of product from TSR to Random House, a loan equivalent to 27.3% of the suggested retail price. The arrangement was mutually beneficial at first: TSR could acquire money up front to fund their work, and not have to worry about immediate sales. Many of TSR&#x27;s products had consistent sales over time, and the loans allowed the company to recoup the investment immediately and use the funds to make more books. Returns were generally low, leading to Random House&#x27;s confidence in TSR. However, the arrangement would cause trouble later in the 1990s.

Gygax granted exclusive rights to Games Workshop to distribute TSR products in the United Kingdom, after meeting with Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson. Games Workshop printed some original material and also printed their own versions of various &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; titles in order to avoid high import costs. TSR was unable to reach an agreement with Games Workshop regarding a possible merger, so the company created the subsidiary TSR Hobbies UK Ltd, in 1980. Gygax hired Don Turnbull to lead the subsidiary, which would expand into continental Europe during the 1980s. TSR UK published a series of modules and the original &quot;Fiend Folio&quot;. TSR UK also produced &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine for 31 issues.

The first-published campaign setting for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, the World of Greyhawk, was introduced in 1980. The espionage role-playing game &quot;Top Secret&quot; came out in 1980; reportedly, a note regarding a fictitious assassination plot on TSR stationery, as part of the playtesting of the new game, prompted the FBI to visit TSR&#x27;s offices. That same year, the Role Playing Game Association was founded to promote skillful roleplaying and unite players around the country. In 1981, &quot;Inc.&quot; magazine listed TSR Hobbies among the hundred fastest-growing privately held U.S. companies. That same year, TSR Hobbies moved its offices again, into a former medical supply building with a warehouse attached. In 1982, TSR Hobbies broke the 20 million sales mark.

TSR Hobbies terminated Grenadier Miniatures&#x27;s license in 1982 and began to directly manufacture an &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; miniatures line, followed by a toy line. Part of the licensing of the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; toy line went to LJN. Also that year, TSR introduced the &quot;Gangbusters&quot; and &quot;Star Frontiers&quot; role-playing games. TSR established exclusive distribution for the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game in 1982 in 22 countries, with the game being translated first into French, followed by many other languages. In 1982, TSR established an educational department with the intention of developing curriculum programs for reading, math, history, and problem solving, with the most successful program among these the &quot;Endless Quest&quot; series of game books.

Melvin Blume&#x27;s shares were later transferred to his son Kevin Blume. After this, the leadership of TSR consisted of Kevin Blume, Brian Blume, and Gary Gygax. In contemporary articles from the early 1980s, Gygax said that the three worked as a team, and only proceeded with unanimous consent and buy-in. In interviews years later, Gygax downplayed his role, and described his position as primarily a powerless figurehead CEO, with Brian Blume as president of creative affairs and Kevin Blume as president of operations. In 1981, TSR Hobbies had revenues of $12.9 million and a payroll of 130.

TSR Hobbies diversified by purchasing or starting new commercial ventures such as producing miniatures, expanding into toys and gifts, and adding an entertainment division to explore getting into films and television. Many parts of this expansion were later criticized as bad investments and over-extension. Greenfield Needlewomen, a needle craft business, was one particularly criticized acquisition; it was owned by a cousin of the Blumes. Sales of D&amp;D-themed needlecraft were abysmal, and the acquisition was criticized as nepotism. The company was similarly accused of favoring friends and relatives of the Blumes and Gygax in hiring. The management also used company funds to raise a shipwreck from Geneva Lake for no clear financial benefit. The company acquired the trademark and copyrights of the magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, although it had only ten thousand subscribers.

====Wargames====
Another acquisition was the 1982 takeover of Simulations Publications Inc. (SPI), one of the major publishers of wargames and wargaming magazines in North America. SPI was heavily in debt, and TSR agreed to give them a promissory note for several hundred thousand dollars, using SPI&#x27;s assets as collateral. SPI immediately used the money to pay off its debts, leaving it cash-poor but debt-free. Less than two weeks later, TSR called in the note; with no cash on hand, SPI was forced to hand over their operation to TSR. Believing the wargame market to be a lucrative opportunity, TSR immediately released several SPI titles that were ready for publication but had been stranded by a lack of money for printing, such as &quot;Battle Over Britain&quot; and &quot;A Gleam of Bayonets&quot;. TSR also reboxed and republished several popular SPI titles from the mid-1970s under the TSR logo, including &quot;Air War&quot;, &quot;Blue &amp; Gray&quot;, and &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Last Battles&quot;. But TSR soon learned that the main reason for SPI&#x27;s large debt was that the wargame market had collapsed. When their wargames failed to sell, TSR halted all new game projects; in reaction, most SPI game designers resigned and moved to rival company Avalon Hill, lured by the formation of a subsidiary specifically for them called Victory Games. TSR published a few wargames created by their own in-house designers, and had a hit with &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, but ten years after the SPI takeover, TSR abandoned the wargame market.

===TSR (1983–1985)===
In 1983, the company was split into four companies: TSR, Inc. (the primary successor), TSR International, TSR Ventures, and TSR Entertainment, Inc.

Gygax left for Hollywood to found TSR Entertainment, Inc., later Dungeons &amp; Dragons Entertainment Corp., which attempted to license &quot;D&amp;D&quot; products to movie and television executives. His work would eventually lead to only a single license for what later became the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; cartoon. This series was the lead program in its time slot for two years.

TSR, Inc. started publication of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; saga in 1984 after being in development for two years. The series was both a set of modules and supplements designed for running campaigns in an entirely new game world, starting with &quot;Dragons of Despair&quot;, as well as a novel series. The novel series was written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. The &quot;Dragonlance&quot; trilogy of novels was a colossal hit; &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot;, the first novel in the series, reached the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, encouraging TSR to a launch a long series of paperback novels. TSR&#x27;s Books Department would go on to launch novels on its other &quot;D&amp;D&quot; settings as well, and be one of TSR&#x27;s most profitable divisions.

In 1984, TSR was able to make licensing agreements that allowed the company to publish the &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, and &quot;Conan&quot; role-playing games. In 1985, Gen Con moved out of Lake Geneva which had given it its name, and relocated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin where the game convention would have more badly needed additional space. The &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; hardback for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; was released that same year, becoming the biggest seller for 1985. TSR published a game based on the &quot;All My Children&quot; daytime drama on ABC, with over 150,000 copies sold. In 1986, TSR began publishing the bi-monthly &quot;Dungeon Adventures&quot; magazine, featuring only adventure scenarios for &quot;D&amp;D&quot;.

====Management turmoil====
Sales of the core rule books and boxed sets crested in 1983 and fell in 1984 and 1985, largely due to market saturation; customers who wanted rulebooks largely already had them. There were bright spots in 1983–1985 such as &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novel sales, &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot;, and &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot;, but TSR&#x27;s finances were in bad shape due to high expenses and costs that had assumed rule book sales would remain strong. The result was a cycle of layoffs and contractions in 1983–1985, as well as the Blumes negotiating a $4 million loan from American National Bank.

The struggle for financing led to board room shake-ups at the top level. TSR&#x27;s line of credit was stopped by its bank, and the company was in debt to over . Gygax would later say that he was in the dark as to the extent of the financial difficulties due to being in Hollywood; Ben Riggs, an author who studied TSR&#x27;s history, is skeptical Gygax was truly unaware, however. Gygax returned to Wisconsin from Hollywood. In the spring of 1985, Gygax exercised an option to buy seven hundred shares of TSR stock, which combined with shares given to his son Ernie gave him 51.1% of all stock, up from around 30% before. Gygax also says he had a confrontation with the board of directors, and had the Blumes removed. Gygax now controlled TSR. Financial difficulties continued, however. Within a year of the departure of the Blumes, the company posted a net loss of US$1.5 million, resulting in layoffs of approximately 75% of the staff. Some of these staff members went on to form other prominent game companies, such as Pacesetter Ltd and Mayfair Games, or to work with Coleco&#x27;s video game division.

Gygax searched for financing. Flint Dille, one of his contacts he made in his time in Hollywood, suggested his sister Lorraine Williams might be interested in investing money into TSR. Williams was given a position of general manager at TSR and attempted to fix TSR&#x27;s precarious financial situation. This led to clashes between Williams and Gygax, who resisted some of Williams&#x27; suggestions. Meanwhile, the Blumes, out of power at the company and worried about its financial strength in the long-term, sought to cash out their shares. They offered to sell their shares to Gygax, but he refused. They exercised their own options to buy seven hundred more shares, then sold their entire holdings to Lorraine Williams instead. Williams herself bought fifty shares. With these purchases, Williams became the majority shareholder of TSR, and used her voting power to depose Gygax as CEO and president on October 22, 1985. Gygax unsuccessfully challenged the sale in court; Gygax&#x27;s supporters considered the Blumes&#x27; sale an act of retaliation. Gygax eventually sold his remaining stock to Williams and used the capital to form New Infinities Productions. On TSR&#x27;s side, they would pepper Gygax with legal threats long after he left in an attempt to deter him from competing with his old company in the area of role-playing games.

===Lorraine Williams era (1985–1997)===
Williams saw potential for rebuilding the debt-plagued company into a highly profitable one. However, she also acquired a reputation as a non-gamer who played the &quot;villain&quot; in retrospectives of TSR. Gary Gygax grew particularly disdainful of her; Williams&#x27; habit of threatening lawsuits and legal action against perceived foes was criticized as unwise and turning potential allies into enemies. However, her tenure has also been defended. John D. Rateliff said that &quot;Every single person I talked to who worked under Gary [Gygax] and the Blumes and then worked under Lorraine preferred working under Lorraine... I never met a single person who was under both who didn&#x27;t prefer being under her.&quot; Jeff Grubb said that she &quot;pretty much saved the company,&quot; as the company was weeks away from total collapse when she took over.

====Tabletop and board gaming in the Williams era====
TSR released the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign setting in 1987, which would go on to become one of the most popular settings for &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. TSR&#x27;s settings would generally include a boxed set with multiple paperbacks and a map as their core product, and would produce tie-in supplements such as pre-made adventures (usually called &quot;modules&quot;), guides to regions within the world, and novels. Also in 1987, a small design team began working to develop a second edition of the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game. In 1988, TSR released the &quot;Bullwinkle and Rocky Role-Playing Party Game&quot;, complete with a spinner and hand puppets. That same year, TSR released the wargame &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; based on Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, which became one of the all-time biggest selling wargames. In 1989, &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd edition was released, which saw a new &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;, &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, and the first three volumes of the new &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot;. A new campaign setting, &quot;Spelljammer&quot;, was also released in 1989, which allowed characters from one &quot;D&amp;D&quot; world to travel to other worlds via space galleons in an Age of Sail themed setting. TSR would go on to produce many expansions for 2nd edition, such as a series of class handbooks that began with &quot;The Complete Fighter&#x27;s Handbook&quot;.

In 1990, the &quot;Ravenloft&quot; setting was released, a horror-themed setting for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;. &quot;Ravenloft&quot; had been introduced in an acclaimed 1983 adventure module, and was now expanded into an entire setting. In 1991, TSR released the &quot;Dark Sun&quot; campaign setting, which was more dark fantasy in genre, and set on a post-apocalyptic desert world threatened by evil life-draining wizards and psionicists. In 1992, TSR released the &quot;Al-Qadim&quot; setting with a Middle Eastern flavor similar to a fantasy version of the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, although its world was also connected to the Forgotten Realms. In 1993, a revised version of the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot; for 2nd edition was released; TSR had published a sourcebook on upgrading the 1st edition material to 2nd edition in 1990 earlier. In 1993, &quot;DragonStrike&quot; was released as an introductory product aimed to recruit new role-players, including a half-hour video which explained role-playing concepts; a similar introductory product, &quot;First Quest&quot;, was released in 1994. Also in 1994, the &quot;Planescape&quot; campaign setting was released, featuring the city of Sigil as the &quot;City of Doors&quot; that connected to the various planes of existence in &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;. &quot;Spelljammer&quot; had not been considered a success by TSR as players perceived it as mainly a way to move characters from one world to another rather than its own setting; &quot;Planescape&quot; attempted to remedy this by focusing on Sigil as a place to set an entire campaign, rather than a place to pass through. TSR also released &quot;&quot; in 1994, which detailed one of the kingdoms in the setting of Mystara. As an innovation, it included an audio CD with tracks of dialogue and sound effects. In 1995, TSR released &quot;Birthright&quot;, a campaign setting that mixed &quot;D&amp;D&quot; with strategy games. The intent was for players to play noble characters empowered by divine blood which gave them the power to rule domains; players could expand their domains and divine powers with a mixture of war and diplomacy. In 1996, &quot;&quot; was released, a &quot;diceless&quot; role-playing game that departed from the roots of &quot;Dragonlance&quot; in &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;.

====Expansion into other products====
Under Williams&#x27; direction, TSR solidified its expansion into other fields, such as magazines, paperback fiction, comic books, and collectible games. TSR&#x27;s book division was a traditional powerhouse for the company, especially due to the comparatively low costs in producing novels compared to role-playing supplements which required commissioning art and play-testing. The most notably successful novel series of the era was R. A. Salvatore&#x27;s Drizzt series, set in the Forgotten Realms. Starting with &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot; in 1988, many of Salvatore&#x27;s books would go on to reach the paperback bestseller lists. TSR eventually moved into publishing hardcover novels as well with Salvatore&#x27;s &quot;The Legacy&quot;, published in 1992. It made the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list weeks after its release.

The Dille Family Trust, of which Lorraine Williams was a part, held the rights to the Buck Rogers license. Williams personally encouraged TSR to produce Buck Rogers tie-in material. TSR would end up publishing Buck Rogers board games, novels, a comic book, and a role-playing game based on the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd Edition rules. TSR&#x27;s Buck Rogers projects were commercial failures.

In the late 1980s, TSR opened a new West Coast division in Southern California to develop various projects in the entertainment industry, similar to how Gygax had sought deals in Hollywood in the early 1980s. However, the efforts of the division would come to &quot;less than nothing&quot; according to TSR historian Ben Riggs, despite initial promise. TSR had an arrangement with DC Comics to produce the comics &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, which sold well and were profitable for both DC and TSR. Sensing an opportunity, TSR decided to produce comics themselves as a stepping stool to television and film, as comics were cheaper to produce and start with. However, they had already sold the rights to their own A-list product in &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;. TSR attempted to not enrage DC Comics by calling their new product &quot;comics modules&quot; and including game-related material at the end of each issue; additionally, TSR largely sold the comics modules through bookshops rather than comic shops. The compromise failed in both directions: DC, feeling betrayed that their partner was moving to become a competitor, immediately stopped production of both the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; and &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; comics, and canceled an in-production &quot;Ravenloft&quot; work. However, the changes to present the product as not a comic book caused the potential audience to either not know of its existence at all, or to be confused as to its nature. TSR West eventually published four comics modules: a Buck Rogers comic, a sci-fi comic &quot;Intruder&quot;, a time travel comic &quot;Warhawks&quot;, and a horror comic called &quot;R.I.P.&quot; They were not commercially successful. TSR West closed around 1991, although TSR would continue to work with Flint Dille on film-adjacent products made in California such as the introductory video for &quot;Dragonstrike&quot; and a 1995 interactive video game series called &quot;Terror T.R.A.X.&quot; In 1994, TSR signed an agreement with Sweetpea Entertainment for rights to make a &quot;D&amp;D&quot; movie. This would eventually result in the 2000 &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; movie.

TSR continued to own and operate the Gen Con role-playing game convention. Gen Con grew beyond its initial focus on &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and wargames to role-playing fans in general. Gen Con was a growing and successful convention; in 1992, it broke every previous record for attendance to game conventions in the United States, with over 18,000 attendees. 

In 1993, Wizards of the Coast released the game &quot;&quot; at Gen Con, which was an immediate smash hit that established the collectible card game (CCG) genre. TSR&#x27;s Jim Ward led a development effort to create a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-themed CCG competitor that would be a response to &quot;Magic&quot;. The result would be &quot;Spellfire&quot;, released in April 1994. &quot;Spellfire&quot; was produced on a shoestring budget, and re-used art that TSR had already commissioned for other projects; Lorraine Williams was not a fan of the project. Its financial results are contested; some TSR insiders say that &quot;Spellfire&quot; sold well considering the constraints on it, while others indicate it sold poorly. &quot;Spellfire&quot; was discontinued in 1996, although one final release occurred in late 1997. Another collectible competitor to Wizards of the Coast that TSR produced was &quot;Dragon Dice&quot;, which was released in 1995. &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; was a collectible dice game where each player started with a random assortment of basic dice, and could improve their assortment by purchasing booster packs of more powerful dice. The first sets of &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; sold well at games stores, and TSR produced several expansion sets. However, interest in &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; was waning. In addition, TSR tried to aggressively market &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; in mass-market book stores through Random House. However, the game did not catch on through the book trade.

TSR&#x27;s book division ran into troubles in the mid-1990s. TSR engaged in disputes with some of its most successful authors over terms and remuneration. Weis &amp; Hickman had been driven off in the mid-1980s; a new dispute with R. A. Salvatore happened in 1994–1995. TSR suffered &quot;the effects of overexpansion&quot; in 1996 with an &quot;expanded number of hardcover novels and a wide array of gaming accessories such as its &quot;Dragon Dice&quot;&quot;. Part of this overexpansion included publishing twelve hardcover novels up from the usual two novels per year. Shannon Appelcline, in &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons: The 90s&quot;, commented that the books were sold at a loss and the &quot;TSR warehouse&quot; was &quot;truckloads&quot; full of &quot;Dragon Dice&quot;.

====Final years: Financial trouble and sale (1995–1997) ====
By 1996, TSR was experiencing numerous problems, as outlined by various historians of the company. Shannon Appelcline wrote: &quot;Distributors were going out of business. TSR had unbalanced their &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game through a series of lucrative supplements that ultimately hurt the long-time viability of the game. Meanwhile, they had developed so many settings—many of them popular and well received—that they were both cannibalizing their only sales and discouraging players from picking up settings that might be gone in a few years. They may have been cannibalizing their own sales through excessive production of books or supplements too.&quot; Ben Riggs agreed that TSR was factionalizing the AD&amp;D audience by continually releasing competing new settings (Forgotten Realms, Al-Qadim, Dragonlance, Planescape, Dark Sun, Birthright, Karameikos, etc.), a strategy intended to lure in new customers, but that actually divided its own core customers. TSR&#x27;s products essentially competed with themselves, requiring more development effort to reach the same number of total customers. Ryan Dancey and Lisa Stevens, who examined TSR&#x27;s finances for Wizards of the Coast, found that many of the AD&amp;D settings products were never profitable, and more worryingly never &quot;could&quot; have been profitable—the cost of production was simply too high compared to the price they sold for. David M. Ewalt writes that &quot;Spellfire&quot; and &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; &quot;were both expensive to produce, and neither sold very well&quot;.

Another factor that hobbled TSR in the long-term was a financial arrangement known as &quot;factoring.&quot; Factoring worked like this: TSR first arranged contracts with retailers in the hobby trade (gaming stores, comics stores, and so on) to preorder their products and offered a discounted rate for contracts signed in January. TSR then took these contracts to investment banks, and was advanced money immediately by the banks, with the banks to be paid off from the eventual sales of the product. This financial innovation allowed TSR to be essentially &quot;paid in advance&quot;, less fees from the banks and from discounts given to suppliers, which worked out to keeping about 82% of the revenue. Getting all of the money in January allowed TSR to budget with more certainty and potentially fund projects with a long lead time immediately, rather than waiting on sales. Other than the direct cost of losing 18 pennies on every dollar of revenue, factoring had the other downside of not being flexible to changing market conditions, as TSR was essentially locked into its budgeting from January. It was partially why &quot;Spellfire&quot; was made on a tiny budget, as TSR was attempting to take on a new initiative in the middle of the year, and led to a fiasco with its &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons CD-ROM Core Rules&quot; product where a preorder arrangement with Babbage&#x27;s was continued despite Babbage&#x27;s becoming financially insolvent.

TSR&#x27;s old deal with Random House, which had been mutually beneficial in the 1980s, began to be used by TSR in ways that would paper over short-term financial problems. Since TSR was paid up front on the assumption that shipped goods would ultimately sell, TSR began shipping overstock to Random House to generate loans on demand. This caused people in the know at TSR to call it the &quot;Banco de Random House&quot;. It also dulled TSR&#x27;s internal sense of which products were selling, leading to overprinting of niche products. Ben Riggs cites the introductory product &quot;DragonStrike&quot; as an example, which sold well but was vastly overprinted. The extra copies were still sent to Random House to generate loans, however. The result was a steadily expanding &quot;debt bubble&quot; with Random House as returns of product soared. Random House eventually noticed something was amiss, and began demanding TSR shrink its debt load with them—around $11.8 million in June 1995. Random House sued TSR in April 1996 for repayment.

Despite total sales of around $40 million in 1995, TSR ended 1996 with little in cash reserves, and the company was deep in debt. Random House returned an unexpectedly high percentage of unsold stock, including the year&#x27;s inventory of unsold novels and sets of &quot;Dragon Dice&quot;, and charged a fee of several million dollars. Random House returned around $14 million of product between 1995 and 1997. TSR found itself in a cash crunch. With no cash, TSR was unable to pay their printing and shipping bills. J. B. Kenehan, the logistics company that handled TSR&#x27;s pre-press, printing, warehousing, and shipping, refused to do any more work. Since the logistics company had the production plates for key products such as core &quot;D&amp;D&quot; books, there was no means of printing or shipping core products to generate income or secure short-term financing. The company laid off thirty staff members in December 1996, and other employees including James M. Ward quit over disagreements about how the company managed the crisis. In large part due to the need to refund Random House, TSR began 1997 more than $30 million in debt. TSR was threatened by lawsuits due to unpaid freelancers as well as missing royalties, but TSR made sufficient earnings from products already shipped to stores to keep their remaining staff paid through the first half of 1997. With no viable financial plan for TSR&#x27;s survival, Lorraine Williams sold the company to Wizards of the Coast in 1997 in a deal brokered by Five Rings Publishing Group (FRPG).

===After acquisition (1997–2000)===
Wizards of the Coast settled TSR&#x27;s debts as part of the acquisition. This included unwinding TSR&#x27;s deal with its printer, enabling the products TSR had worked on in the first half of 1997 to be printed and distributed, such as the space opera game &quot;Alternity&quot;. More generally, Wizards was cash-rich, which solved some of the problems TSR had faced that had caused it to resort to the rolling loans and financial trickery that had cut into TSR&#x27;s profits, such as factoring. Wizards of the Coast also moved to mend relations with some of TSR&#x27;s former employees and contractors who had been alienated. This included allowing artists to take back personal ownership of the original versions of art they had made for TSR.

Wizards eventually closed the TSR corporate offices in Lake Geneva. Some TSR employees accepted the offer of transferring to Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s offices in Washington, and a few others continued to work remotely from Wisconsin. Wizards of the Coast continued to use the TSR name for &quot;D&amp;D&quot; products for three years. Wizards also set about the creation of the third edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. It was released in 2000 under the Wizards of the Coast brand only. In 1999, Wizards of the Coast was itself purchased by Hasbro, Inc. In 2002, the Gen Con convention was sold to Peter Adkison, the founder and CEO of Wizards of the Coast.

==Business disputes==

After its initial success faded, the company turned to legal defenses of what it regarded as its intellectual property. In addition, there were several legal cases brought regarding who had invented what within the company and the division of royalties, including several lawsuits against Gygax. This included the company threatening to sue individuals supplying game material on websites. 

In 1984, there was an incident involving Lucasfilm that led to a legend that TSR had trademarked the term &quot;Nazi&quot;. TSR published a supplement for the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; RPG, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark Adventure Pack&quot;, in which some figures were marked with &quot;Nazi™&quot;. This trademark notation was because of a list of trademarked character names supplied by Lucasfilm&#x27;s legal department; they had indiscriminately marked all figures with a trademark symbol, and the Nazi figures were likewise marked accidentally.

== Subsequent trademark usage ==
===TSR Games/Solarian Games (2011-2021)===
In 2011, a new company taking the name TSR was founded by Jayson Elliot, who co-founded the Roll for Initiative podcast. Elliot found that the TSR trademark had expired around 2004 so he registered it himself. He then decided to launch the new company with assistance from early TSR/D&amp;D contributors including Luke and Ernie Gygax, sons of the deceased D&amp;D co-creator Gary Gygax, and Tim Kask, former editor of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine. Their first product was &quot;Gygax Magazine&quot;, announced along with the TSR company revival in December 2012. &quot;Wired&quot; reported that &quot;Elliot stressed that his &#x27;TSR is a new company&#x27;.&quot; Both Gygax brothers left the company in 2016 when the magazine ended. The company operated as TSR Games, producing the &quot;Top Secret: New World Order&quot; role-playing game.

===TSR Games (2021-)===
In June 2021, a new, separate TSR company was launched by a group including Ernie Gygax, Justin LaNasa and Stephen Dinehart. The company is based out of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin; they announced plans to release tabletop games and operate the Dungeon Hobby Shop Museum, which is located in the first office building of the original TSR. Elliot&#x27;s TSR Games then announced on social media that while they have owned the trademark since 2011, they missed a filing date in 2020 and were considering various options. However, after Ernie Gygax&#x27;s &quot;troubling comments about race, gender identity, and gun violence, as well as his company&#x27;s reaction&quot;, Elliot announced that his company would not have &quot;any form of working relationship&quot; with Ernie Gygax&#x27;s TSR. Ultimately, Elliot&#x27;s TSR Games was rebranded as Solarian Games in July 2021. Dinehart then rebranded as Wonderfilled Games. &quot;Dicebreaker&quot; reported that &quot;TSR Games never officially announced its rebranding as Wonderfilled Games&quot; and most of its &quot;Twitter accounts had been locked down or nuked, and the company&#x27;s old website simply redirected to a new page that — interestingly — listed Dinehart&#x27;s GiantLands as an in-development title. [...] How much of TSR Games exists in Wonderfilled Games isn&#x27;t clear&quot;.

LaNasa&#x27;s TSR Games then launched a crowdfunding campaign in December 2021 to raise money to sue Wizards of the Coast for &quot;Trademark Declaratory Judgement of Ownership&quot;; the company then filed and voluntarily dismissed the complaint that month. Wizards of the Coast, also in December 2021, sued LaNasa&#x27;s TSR for trademark fraud over the use of the TSR logo which is owned by Wizards of the Coast. In July 2022, &quot;TechRaptor&quot; reported on a leaked &quot;Star Frontiers: New Genesis&quot; (a reboot of the 1982 &quot;Star Frontiers&quot; role-playing game) playtest created by LaNasa&#x27;s TSR; the content contains &quot;blatantly racist&quot; descriptions of character races and the race design &quot;plays into Nazi eugenics&quot;. The content also contains &quot;homophobic, transphobic, and anti-semitic content, as well as additional material of a discriminatory nature&quot;. &quot;IGN Southeast Asia&quot; highlighted that in this playtest game a black &quot;race is classified as a &#x27;Subrace&#x27; and having &#x27;average&#x27; intellect with a maximum intelligence rating of 9, whereas the &#x27;norse&#x27; race has a minimum intelligence rating of 13&quot;.

In September 2022, Wizards of the Coast sued TSR Games—helmed by Ernie Gygax and LaNasa—and the Dungeon Hobby Shop Museum to enjoin these companies from publishing games under the &quot;Star Frontiers&quot; and &quot;TSR&quot; trademarks. In its motion for a preliminary injunction, Wizards of the Coast wrote that TSR&#x27;s &quot;Star Frontiers: New Genesis&quot; game is &quot;despicable&quot; and &quot;blatantly racist and transphobic&quot;, and that the publication of such content would inflict reputational harm on Wizards of the Coast. Charlie Hall, for &quot;Polygon&quot;, commented that &quot;Wizards&#x27; filing also seeks to undermine LaNasa&#x27;s most powerful argument — that Wizards abandoned TSR and other related trademarks, thus opening the door to his usurping of the brand and its games. [...] Here&#x27;s where things get complicated. Wizards admitted that it failed to file paperwork for the registration of TSR, Star Frontiers, and other related marks in a timely fashion as required under federal law. But through continued sales of related products and use of the related IP, the company claims ownership via &#x27;common law trademark rights.&#x27; It will be up to a jury to determine if that is, in fact, the case&quot;. In December 2022, a federal magistrate judge denied the preliminary injunction Wizards of the Coast filed. The judge said that Wizards had not yet shown enough evidence to demonstrate continuous use of the TSR brand; she also noted that the defendants disclaimed the racist version of the game and had promised not to release any version of &quot;Star Frontiers&quot; at all until the court case concludes, hence there was no need for a preliminary injunction. In June 2023, LaNasa&#x27;s TSR declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which triggered an automatic stay of the lawsuit.

==Products==
TSR&#x27;s main products were role-playing games, the most successful of which was &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. However, they also produced other games such as card games, board games, and dice games, and published both magazines and books.

===Fiction===

In 1984, TSR started publishing novels based on their games. Most &quot;D&amp;D&quot; campaign settings had their own novel line, the most successful of which were the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; and &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; lines, with dozens of novels each.

TSR also published the 1995 novel &quot;Buck Rogers: A Life in the Future&quot; by Martin Caidin, a standalone re-imagining of the Buck Rogers universe and unrelated to TSR&#x27;s &quot;Buck Rogers XXVC&quot; game.

TSR published a large number of fantasy and science fiction novels unconnected with their gaming products, such as L. Dean James&#x27; &quot;Red Kings of Wynnamyr&quot; novels, &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1991) and &quot;Kingslayer&quot; (1992); Mary H. Herbert&#x27;s five &quot;Gabria&quot; novels (&quot;Valorian&quot;, &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, &quot;Lightning&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;City of the Sorcerers&quot;, and &quot;Winged Magic&quot;); and humorous fantasy fiction, including Roy V. Young&#x27;s &quot;Count Yor&quot; novels &quot;Captains Outrageous&quot; (1994) and &quot;Yor&#x27;s Revenge&quot;(1995). However, such projects never represented more than a fraction of the company&#x27;s fiction output, which retained a strong emphasis on game-derived works.

<text>A terminate-and-stay-resident program (commonly TSR) is a computer program running under DOS that uses a system call to return control to DOS as though it has finished, but remains in computer memory so it can be reactivated later. This technique partially overcame DOS&#x27;s limitation of executing only one program, or task, at a time. TSRs are used only in DOS, not in Windows.

Some TSRs are utility software that a computer user might call up several times a day, while working in another program, by using a hotkey. Borland Sidekick was an early and popular example of this type. Others serve as device drivers for hardware that the operating system does not directly support.

==Use ==
Normally DOS can run only one program at a time. When a program finishes, it returns control to DOS using the system call of the DOS API. The memory and system resources used are then marked as unused. This makes it impossible to restart parts of the program without having to reload it all. However, if a program ends with the system call or , the operating system does not reuse a certain specified part of its memory.

The original call, , is called &quot;terminate but stay resident&quot;, hence the name &quot;TSR&quot;. Using this call, a program can make up to 64 KB of its memory resident. MS-DOS version 2.0 introduced an improved call, (&#x27;Keep Process&#x27;), which removed this limitation and let the program return an exit code. Before making this call, the program can install one or several interrupt handlers pointing into itself, so that it can be called again. Installing a hardware interrupt vector allows such a program to react to hardware events. Installing a software interrupt vector allows it to be called by the currently running program. Installing a timer interrupt handler allows a TSR to run periodically (using a programmable interval timer).

The typical method of using an interrupt vector involves reading its present value (the address), storing it within the memory space of the TSR, and replacing it with an address in its own code. The stored address is called from the TSR, in effect forming a singly linked list of interrupt handlers, also called &quot;interrupt service routines&quot;, or ISRs. This procedure of installing ISRs is called &quot;chaining&quot; or &quot;hooking&quot; an interrupt or an interrupt vector.

TSRs can be loaded at any time; either during the DOS startup sequence (for example, from AUTOEXEC.BAT), or at the user&#x27;s request (for example, Borland&#x27;s Sidekick and Turbo Debugger, Quicken&#x27;s QuickPay, or FunStuff Software&#x27;s Personal Calendar). Parts of DOS itself use this technique, especially in DOS versions 5.0 and later. For example, the DOSKEY command-line editor and various other utilities are installed by running them at the command line (manually, or from AUTOEXEC.BAT or through codice_1 from within CONFIG.SYS) rather than loading them as device drivers through codice_2 statements in CONFIG.SYS.

Some TSRs have no way to unload themselves, so they will remain in memory until a reboot. However unloading is possible externally, using utilities like the MARK.EXE/RELEASE.EXE combo by TurboPower Software or &quot;soft reboot&quot; TSRs which will catch a specific key combination and release all TSRs loaded after them. As the chain of ISRs is singly linked, and a TSR may store the link to its predecessor anywhere it chooses, there is no general way for a TSR to remove itself from the chain. So usually a stub must be left in memory when unloading a TSR, causing memory fragmentation. This problem gave rise to TSR cooperation frameworks such as TesSeRact and AMIS.

=== Interrupt sharing ===

To manage problems with many TSRs sharing the same interrupt, a method called Alternate Multiplex Interrupt Specification (AMIS) was proposed by Ralf D. Brown as an improvement over previously used services offered via INT 2Fh. AMIS provides ways to share software interrupts in a controlled manner. It is modeled after IBM&#x27;s Interrupt Sharing Protocol, originally invented for sharing hardware interrupts of an x86 processor. AMIS services are available via Int 2Dh.

The proposal never gained a widespread traction among programmers in its days. It existed alongside several other competing specifications of varying sophistication.

==Faults==
While very useful, or even essential to overcome DOS&#x27;s limitations, TSRs have a reputation as troublemakers. Many hijack the operating system in varying documented or undocumented ways, often causing systems to crash on their activation or deactivation when used with particular applications or other TSRs.

By chaining the interrupt vectors TSRs can take complete control of the computer. A TSR can have one of two behaviors:

* Take complete control of an interrupt by not calling other TSRs that had previously altered the same interrupt vector.
* Cascade with other TSRs by calling the old interrupt vector. This can be done before or after they executed their actual code. This way TSRs can form a chain where each calls the next.

The terminate-and-stay-resident method is used by most DOS viruses and other malware, which can either take control of the PC or stay in the background. This malware can react to disk I/O or execution events by infecting executable (.EXE or .COM) files when it is run and data files when they are opened.

Additionally, in DOS all programs must be loaded into the first 640 KB of RAM (the conventional memory), even on computers with large amounts of physical RAM. TSRs are no exception, and take chunks from that 640 KB that are thus unavailable to other applications. This meant that writing a TSR was a challenge of achieving the smallest possible size for it, and checking it for compatibility with a lot of software products from different vendors—often a very frustrating task.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, many video games on the PC platform pushed up against this limit and left less and less space for TSRs—even essential ones like CD-ROM drivers—and arranging things so that there was enough free RAM to run the games, while keeping the necessary TSRs present, became very complicated. Many gamers had several boot disks with different configurations for different games. In later versions of MS-DOS, &quot;boot menu&quot; scripts allowed various configurations to be selectable via a single menu entry. In the mid- to later 1990s, while many games were still written for DOS, the 640 KB limit was eventually overcome by putting parts of the game&#x27;s data above the first 1 MB of memory and using the code below 640 KB to access the extended memory using expanded memory (EMS) by making use of overlay technique. An alternative later approach was to switch the CPU into Protected Mode by using DOS extenders and run the program in protected mode. The latter allowed to have code and data in the extended memory area.

Because programming with many overlays is a challenge in and of itself, once the program was too big to fit entirely into about 512 KB, use of extended memory was almost always done using a third-party DOS extender implementing VCPI or DPMI, because it becomes much easier and faster to access memory above the 1 MB boundary, and possible to run code in that area, when the x86 processor is switched from real mode to protected mode. However, since DOS and most DOS programs run in real mode (VCPI or DPMI makes a protected-mode program look like a real-mode program to DOS and the rest of the system by switching back and forth between the two modes), DOS TSRs and device drivers also run in real mode, and so any time one gets control, the DOS extender has to switch back to real mode until it relinquishes control, incurring a time penalty (unless they utilize techniques such as DPMS or CLOAKING).

==Return==
With the arrival of expanded memory boards and especially of Intel 80386 processors in the second half of the 1980s, it became possible to use memory above 640 KB to load TSRs. This required complex software solutions, named &quot;expanded memory managers&quot;. Some memory managers are QRAM and QEMM by Quarterdeck, 386MAX by Qualitas, CEMM by Compaq, and later EMM386 by Microsoft. The memory areas usable for loading TSRs above 640 KB are called &quot;upper memory blocks&quot; (UMBs) and loading programs into them is called &quot;loading high&quot;. Later, memory managers started including programs such as Quarterdeck&#x27;s Optimize or Microsoft&#x27;s MEMMAKER which try to maximize the available space in the first 640 KB by determining how best to allocate TSRs between low and high memory.

==Decline==
With the development of games using DOS extenders (an early example was &quot;Doom&quot;) which bypassed the 640 KB barrier, many of the issues relating to TSRs disappeared, and with the widespread adoption of Microsoft Windows and especially Windows 95 (followed by Windows 98) – which rendered most TSRs unnecessary and some TSRs incompatible – the TSR faded into obsolescence, though Win16 applications can do TSR-like tricks such as patching the interrupt descriptor table (IDT) because Windows allowed it.
Windows Me does not allow a computer to boot into a DOS Kernel by shutting down Windows Me; thus TSRs became useless on Windows Me.

The Windows NT series (including Windows 2000, Windows XP, and later) replaced DOS completely and run in protected mode or long mode (later 64-bit versions only) all the time, disabling the ability to switch to real mode, which is needed for TSRs to function. Instead these operating systems have modern driver and service frameworks with memory protection and preemptive multitasking, allowing multiple programs and device drivers to run simultaneously without the need for special programming tricks; the kernel and its modules have been made exclusively responsible for modifying the interrupt table.

<doc id="69743" wikidata="Q2247343" url="?curid=69743" title="Spit (card game)">
<text>Spit is a card game of the shedding family for two players. It is a form of competitive patience. The game is played until all of a player&#x27;s cards are gone. It has a close variant known as Speed. Spit appears to have originated in the UK in the 1980s.

==Objective==
The goal of Spit is to get rid of one&#x27;s cards as quickly as possible. The players do not take turns; physical speed and alertness is required to play faster than the opponent. On each deal, the player who is first to go through all of their starting cards can reduce the number of cards for the next deal. By being successful for several deals, clearing all of one&#x27;s cards becomes possible, and if this is carried out successfully, one wins the game.

==Setup==
Spit is played by two players. The entire pack is split between them, and each player makes five stacks in front of themselves in a row as follows: 

*Stack 1: (0 cards face down), 1 card face up
*Stack 2: 1 card face down, 1 card face up
*Stack 3: 2 cards face down, 1 card face up
*Stack 4: 3 cards face down, 1 card face up
*Stack 5: 4 cards face down, 1 card face up

There is an alternative setup where each person lays down four cards face up separately, and a stack of ten face-down cards with one face-up card on top, similar to the setup for Canfield.

The object of the game is to move all of these cards into two &quot;spit piles&quot; that start empty in between the two player&#x27;s rows of cards. Each player&#x27;s eleven remaining cards not dealt into stacks are placed face down in a pile next to the play area; these are the spit cards. Within each player&#x27;s row of cards, face-up cards of the same value (the same card but a different suit) may be placed upon each other. Then, the face-down cards revealed from this are turned over. This process continues until each player&#x27;s row has face-up cards of five different values.

Players must leave their stacks on the table, and only one card can be played at a time. Players may either use both or just one hand while playing Spit; however, both players need to agree on either one or both.

== Play ==
To begin, both players say &quot;spit&quot; (or &quot;slam&quot; or &quot;speed&quot;, depending on the variation) simultaneously as each player flips over the top card from their spit cards into the centre to start the two spit piles. Then, the two players attempt to play the cards from their rows of cards into the spit piles as fast as they can; there are no turns.

Each player can play their face-up cards from their row onto either spit pile, if the previous card in that spit pile is of a consecutive value. For example, a 5 can be placed upon a 4 or a 6, but not another 5. An Ace is considered consecutive to both King and 2. When a face-up card is used, the next card under it in its stack can be turned over and then played. If a stack of the rows is empty, a player can transfer any face-up card into that space and turn over the following card. As during setup, face-up cards of the same rank may be placed on top of each other within the rows.

Once either player has depleted the cards from their row, each player tries to slap the spit pile that they think is smaller. Whoever slaps first gets the pile slapped, and the other player takes the other spit pile. (In some variants the player who plays all their cards just chooses a pile.) These cards are added to the remainder of the player&#x27;s spit cards and then shuffled together and dealt into rows as done at the start of the deal. There is no set number of rounds because the first to lose all of their cards is the winner.

If the run reaches a point where both players are stuck or choose not to play a card, both players once again say &quot;spit&quot; simultaneously and each player turns their top spit card face up, placing it on one of the spit piles. Play then resumes as described above.

===End of play===
When one player starts with fifteen cards or fewer, there will only be one spit pile, and the first player to get rid of their rows doesn&#x27;t take anything from the center. The opponent takes the spit pile and their tableau cards.

If the player with no spit cards in their hand is also the one who gets rid of their rows first, they win the game. If their opponent gets rid of their tableau first, the game continues.

==Comparison with Speed==
Spit is similar to the game Speed in the sense that players attempt to get rid of all their cards first. Speed requires 4 stacks, two having five or ten. If there are five cards in the outer stacks in the middle each player is dealt twenty cards, while if there are fifteen cards, ten are dealt. Speed permits players to use Jokers as wild cards, where in Spit, the Jokers are commonly (but not always) removed from the deck.

When playing Speed, while slapping the final pile, players have the option of shouting the word “Speed” as they slap the deck. This rule can be carried over to Spit, however it is not mandatory. The difference between Spit and Speed is in the arrangement of the stock piles. In Spit, each player has a row of piles, usually five, each with the top card face up. In Speed, each player has a single face down stock pile and a hand of five cards.

<text>The Molten Sea or Brazen Sea ( &quot;yām mūṣāq&quot; &quot;cast metal sea&quot;) was a large basin in the Temple in Jerusalem made by Solomon for ablution of the priests. It is described in and . It stood in the south-eastern corner of the inner court. According to the Bible it was five cubits high, ten cubits in diameter from brim to brim, and thirty cubits in circumference. The brim was like the rim of a cup or like a lily blossom, and its thickness was a hand breadth&quot;, three or four inches. It was placed on the backs of twelve oxen, standing with their faces outward. It was capable of containing two or three thousand baths of water (). The fact that it was a wash basin which was too large to enter from above lends to the idea that water would likely have flowed from it down into a subcontainer beneath. The water was originally supplied by the Gibeonites, but was afterwards brought by a conduit from Solomon&#x27;s Pools. The &quot;molten sea&quot; was made of brass or bronze, which Solomon had taken from the captured cities of Hadarezer, the king of Zobah (). Ahaz later removed this laver from the oxen, and placed it on a stone pavement (). It was destroyed by the Chaldeans ().

==In rabbinical literature==

The basin contained water sufficient for two thousand baths. Adding to its Biblical description, according to the Talmud, the laver was not entirely round; the upper two-fifths were round, but the lower three were square.

The symbolism and specific appearance of the brazen sea is described in detail in the Midrash Tadshe. The sea represented the world and the ten ells of diameter corresponded to the ten Sefirot; it was round at the top (according to the Talmud passage above cited), as the heavens are round, and the specific curvature reflected the Hebrew zodiac (Mazzaloth). The depth of the sea was five ells, corresponding to the distance of five hundred years&#x27; journey between heaven and earth. The two rows of colocynths (knops) below the rim were symbolic of the sun (greater light) and the moon (lesser light). The band of thirty ells around it corresponded to the Ten Commandments, to the ten words of God at the creation of the world, and to the ten Sefirot: for the world can exist only when the Ten Commandments are observed, and the ten Sefirot as well as the ten words of God were the instruments of the Creation. The twelve oxen on which the sea rested represented the Twelve Tribes of Israel. It contained 2,000 baths (cubic measures), for the world will sustain him who keeps the Torah, which was created 2,000 years before the world.

==The Laver of the Tabernacle==
In the Priestly Code of Exodus, instead of the Molten Sea is described a bronze &quot;laver&quot; (basin), which was to rest on a bronze &quot;foot&quot; (presumably meaning &quot;a stand&quot;). The text explains that this laver was to be used for the Israelite priests to wash their hands and feet when they entered the sanctuary.
This is confirmed in a later part of the Priestly Code, in the passage describing the actual installation of the Tabernacle furniture.

The size and shape of this laver are not mentioned anywhere in the Bible, and nor are those of its stand, unlike the case for the Molten Sea. By contrast, the special golden candlestick is described by the Priestly Code, but not in the description of Solomon&#x27;s temple. It might therefore be the case that the laver and the candlestick are somehow the same object.

===Relation to Solomon&#x27;s platform===
Solomon is described by the Book of Chronicles as having constructed a special platform in his Temple, for him to use during the opening ceremony. Although it is often assumed that the text describes Solomon as standing on this platform, the text could equally be read &quot;stood next to&quot;.

This platform is literally described by the masoretic text as a laver (Hebrew: &quot;kiyyor&quot;), and as with the Priestly Code&#x27;s laver, there is only one platform, and it is placed in the centre of the outer court. The Septuagint calls it a &quot;base&quot;, and the size of the brazen platform is the same as that of each base for the ten brazen lavers.

It is therefore quite possible that the account of this platform in the Book of Chronicles is actually an account of a laver corresponding to the laver of the Priestly Code.

==Latter-Day Saint interpretation==

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) believe that the molten sea in Solomon&#x27;s Temple was a baptismal font. As explained by church leader Bruce R. McConkie:

In Solomon&#x27;s Temple a large molten sea of brass was placed on the backs of 12 brazen oxen, these oxen being symbolical of the 12 tribes of Israel. This brazen sea was used for performing baptisms for the living. There were no baptisms for the dead until after the resurrection of Christ.

It must be remembered that all direct and plain references to baptism have been deleted from the Old Testament (1 Nephi 13) and that the word &quot;baptize&quot; is of Greek origin. Some equivalent word, such as &quot;wash&quot;, would have been used by the Hebrew peoples. In describing the molten sea the Old Testament record says, &quot;The sea was for the priests to wash in.&quot; (). This is tantamount to saying that the priests performed baptisms in it.

Every temple of the LDS Church contains a baptismal font on twelve oxen which is modeled after the molten sea. The Church performs baptisms for the dead in these fonts.

==Approximation of π==
The biblical description that the bowl has a diameter of 10 cubits and a circumference of 30 cubits suggest that in the construction of the basin, was approximated with the integer value 3. This is consistent with the practice in Babylonian mathematics at the time (6th century BC), but it has given rise to debate within rabbinical Judaism from an early period due to the concern that the biblical text might here be inaccurate. 

Rabbi Nehemiah in the 2nd century argued that the text is not claiming that equals 3, but that instead the Hebrews measured the diameter from the outside edge of the rim of the bowl, while the circumference was measured from under the rim, since it cannot be measured with a cord along the outside edge of the rim. After accounting for the width of the brim—&quot;about an hand breadth&quot;—this results in a ratio closer to the true value of . Taking a &quot;cubit&quot; to be about and a &quot;handbreadth&quot; to be about , the ratio of the described dimensions of the bowl differs from by less than 1%.

Rabbi Max Munk pointed to the fact that the word for measuring line in the respective verses (1 Kings 7:23, 2 Chronicles 4:2) is written in two different ways, as קוה and קו. That hints to two different measures. If the Hebrew letters are read as numbers, the first form of the word for measuring line adds to 111 and the second form to 106. The relation, i.e. the quotient of these two measuring tapes, is 1.0472. And if this number, the relation of these two measuring tapes, is multiplied with Solomon&#x27;s simple pi of 3, the result reads: 3.1416, the value of accurate to four digits.

<doc id="69755" wikidata="Q735176" url="?curid=69755" title="Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow">
<text>The Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow was a delta-winged interceptor aircraft designed and built by Avro Canada. The CF-105 held the promise of Mach 2 speeds at altitudes exceeding and was intended to serve as the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s (RCAF) primary interceptor into the 1960s and beyond.

The Arrow was the culmination of a series of design studies begun in 1953 that examined improved versions of the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. After considerable study, the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design, and serious development began in March 1955. The aircraft was intended to be built directly from the production line, skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase. The first Arrow Mk. 1, RL-201, was rolled out to the public on 4 October 1957, the same day as the launch of Sputnik I.

Flight testing began with RL-201 on 25 March 1958, and the design quickly demonstrated excellent handling and overall performance, reaching Mach 1.9 in level flight. Powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney J75, another four Mk. 1s were completed, RL-202, RL-203, RL-204 and RL-205. The lighter and more powerful Orenda Iroquois engine was soon ready for testing, and the first Mk 2 with the Iroquois, RL-206, was ready for taxi testing in preparation for flight and acceptance tests by RCAF pilots by early 1959.

Canada tried to sell the Arrow to the US and Britain, but no agreements were concluded. 

On 20 February 1959, Prime Minister of Canada John Diefenbaker abruptly halted the development of both the Arrow and its Iroquois engines before the scheduled project review to evaluate the program could be held. Two months later the assembly line, tooling, plans, existing airframes, and engines were ordered to be destroyed. The cancellation was the topic of considerable political controversy at the time, and the subsequent destruction of the aircraft in production remains a topic for debate among historians and industry pundits. &quot;This action effectively put Avro out of business and its highly skilled engineering and production personnel scattered&quot;.

==Design and development==

===Background===
In the post-Second World War period, the Soviet Union began developing a capable fleet of long-range bombers with the ability to deliver nuclear weapons across North America and Europe. The main threat was principally from high-speed, high-altitude bombing runs launched from the Soviet Union travelling over the Arctic against military bases and built-up industrial centres in Canada and the United States. To counter this threat, Western countries developed interceptors that could engage and destroy these bombers before they reached their targets.

A. V. Roe Canada Limited had been set up as a subsidiary of the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1945, initially handling repair and maintenance work for aircraft at the Malton, Ontario, Airport, today known as Toronto Pearson International Airport. The next year the company began the design of Canada&#x27;s first jet fighter for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Avro CF-100 Canuck all-weather interceptor. The Canuck underwent a lengthy and troubled prototype stage before entering service seven years later in 1953. Nevertheless, it went on to become one of the most enduring aircraft of its class, serving in a variety of roles until 1981.

Recognizing that the delays that affected the development and deployment of the CF-100 could also affect its successor, and that the Soviets were working on newer jet-powered bombers that would render the CF-100 ineffective, the RCAF began looking for a supersonic, missile-armed successor for the Canuck even before it had entered service. In March 1952, the RCAF&#x27;s &quot;Final Report of the All-Weather Interceptor Requirements Team&quot; was submitted to Avro Canada.

===Higher speeds===
Avro engineering had been considering supersonic issues already at this point. Supersonic flight works in a very different fashion and presents a number of new problems. One of the most critical, and surprising, was the sudden onset of a new form of drag, known as wave drag. The effects of wave drag were so strong that engines of the era could not provide enough power to overcome it, leading to the concept of a &quot;sound barrier&quot;.

German research during the Second World War had shown the onset of wave drag was greatly reduced by using airfoils that varied in curvature as gradually as possible. This suggested the use of thinner airfoils with much longer chord than designers would have used on subsonic aircraft. These designs were impractical because they left little internal room in the wing for armament or fuel.

The Germans also discovered it was possible to &quot;trick&quot; the airflow into the same behaviour if a conventional thicker airfoil was used swept rearward at a sharp angle, creating a swept wing. This provided many of the advantages of a thinner airfoil while also retaining the internal space needed for strength and fuel storage. Another advantage was that the wings were clear of the supersonic shock wave generated by the nose of the aircraft.

Almost every fighter project in the postwar era immediately applied the concept, which started appearing on production fighters in the late 1940s. Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail modifications to the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. The basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.

===Delta wings===
Another solution to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had many of the same advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions.

The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.

Further proposals based on the delta wing resulted in two versions of the design known as C104: the single engine C104/4 and twin-engined C104/2. The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing and sharply raked vertical stabilizer. The primary advantages of the C104/2 were its twin-engine reliability and a larger overall size, which offered a much larger internal weapons bay. The proposals were submitted to the RCAF in June 1952.

===AIR 7-3 and C105===
Intensive discussions between Avro and the RCAF examined a wide range of alternative sizes and configurations for a supersonic interceptor, culminating in RCAF Specification AIR 7-3 in April 1953. AIR 7-3 called specifically for a two crew, twin engine, aircraft with a range of ) for a normal low-speed mission, and for a high-speed interception mission. It also specified operation from a runway; a Mach 1.5 cruising speed at an altitude of ; and manoeuvrability for 2 &quot;g&quot; turns with no loss of speed or altitude at Mach 1.5 and . The specification required five minutes from starting the aircraft&#x27;s engines to reaching altitude and Mach 1.5. It was also to have turn-around time on the ground of less than . An RCAF team led by Ray Foottit visited US aircraft producers and surveyed British and French manufacturers before concluding that no existing or planned aircraft could fulfill these requirements.

In 1955 Avro estimated the performance of the Arrow Mk 2 (with Iroquois) as follows, from the January 1955 British evaluation titled Evaluation of the CF.105 as an All Weather Fighter for the RAF: &quot;Max speed Mach 1.9 at 50,000 ft, Combat speed of Mach 1.5 at 50,000 feet and 1.84 g without bleeding energy, time to 50,000 ft of 4.1 minutes, 500-foot per minute climb ceiling of 62,000 feet, 400 nmi radius on a high-speeds mission, 630 nmi radius on a low-speed mission, Ferry range is not given, but estimated at 1,500 nmi.&quot;

Avro submitted their modified C105 design in May 1953, essentially a two-man version of the C104/2. A change to a &quot;shoulder-mounted&quot; wing allowed rapid access to the aircraft&#x27;s internals, weapons bay, and engines. The new design also allowed the wing to be built as a single structure sitting on the upper fuselage, simplifying construction and improving strength. The wing design and positioning required a long main landing gear that still had to fit within the thin delta wing, presenting an engineering challenge. Five different wing sizes were outlined in the report, ranging between ; the sized version was eventually selected.

The primary engine selection was the Rolls-Royce RB.106, an advanced two-spool design offering around . Backup designs were the Bristol Olympus OL-3, the US-built Curtiss-Wright J67 version of the OL-3, or the Orenda TR.9 engines.

Armament was stored in a large internal bay located in a &quot;belly&quot; position, taking up over one third of the aircraft fuselage. A wide variety of weapons could be deployed from this bay, such as the Hughes Falcon guided missile, the CARDE Velvet Glove air-to-air missile, or four general-purpose 1,000 lb bombs. The Velvet Glove radar-guided missile had been under development with the RCAF for some time, but was believed unsuitable for supersonic speeds and lacked development potential. Consequently, further work on that project was cancelled in 1956.

In July 1953, the proposal was accepted and Avro was given the go-ahead to start a full design study under the project name: &quot;CF-105&quot;. In December, CA$27 million was provided to start flight modelling. At first, the project was limited in scope, but the introduction of the Soviet Myasishchev M-4 &quot;Bison&quot; jet bomber and the Soviet Union&#x27;s testing of a hydrogen bomb the next month dramatically changed Cold War priorities. In March 1955, the contract was upgraded to CA$260 million for five Arrow Mk.1 flight-test aircraft, to be followed by 35 Arrow Mk. 2s with production engines and fire-control systems.

===Production===
To meet the timetable set by the RCAF, Avro decided that the Arrow program would adopt the Cook-Craigie plan. Normally a small number of prototypes of an aircraft were hand-built and flown to find problems, and when solutions were found these changes would be worked into the design. When satisfied with the results, the production line would be set up. In a Cook-Craigie system, the production line was set up first and a small number of aircraft were built as production models. Any changes would be incorporated into the jigs while testing continued, with full production starting when the test program was complete. As Jim Floyd noted at the time, this was a risky approach: &quot;it was decided to take the technical risks involved to save time on the programme ... I will not pretend that this philosophy of production type build from the outset did not cause us a lot of problems in Engineering. However, it did achieve its objective.&quot;

To mitigate risks, a massive testing program was started. By mid-1954, the first production drawings were issued and wind tunnel work began, along with extensive computer simulation studies carried out both in Canada and the United States using sophisticated computer programs. In a related program, nine instrumented free-flight models were mounted on solid fuel Nike rocket boosters and launched from Point Petre over Lake Ontario while two additional models were launched from the NASA facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, over the Atlantic Ocean. These models were for aerodynamic drag and stability testing, flown to a maximum speed of Mach 1.7+ before intentionally crashing into the water.

Experiments showed the need for only a small number of design changes, mainly involving the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.

The construction of the airframe was fairly conventional, with a semi-monocoque frame and multi-spar wing. The aircraft used a measure of magnesium and titanium in the fuselage, the latter limited largely to the area around the engines and to fasteners. Titanium was still expensive and not widely used because it was difficult to machine.

The Arrow&#x27;s thin wing required aviation&#x27;s first hydraulic system to supply enough force to the control surfaces, while using small actuators and piping. A rudimentary fly-by-wire system was employed, in which the pilot&#x27;s input was detected by a series of pressure-sensitive transducers in the stick, and their signal was sent to an electronic control servo that operated the valves in the hydraulic system to move the various flight controls. This resulted in a lack of control feel; because the control stick input was not mechanically connected to the hydraulic system, the variations in back-pressure from the flight control surfaces that would normally be felt by the pilot could no longer be transmitted back into the stick. To re-create a sense of feel, the same electronic control box rapidly responded to the hydraulic back-pressure fluctuations and triggered actuators in the stick, making it move slightly; this system, called &quot;artificial feel&quot;, was also a first.

In 1954, the RB.106 program was cancelled, necessitating the use of the backup Wright J67 engine instead. In 1955, this engine was also cancelled, leaving the design with no engine. At this point, the Pratt &amp; Whitney J75 was selected for the initial test-flight models, while the new TR 13 engine was developed at Orenda for the production Mk 2s.

After evaluating the engineering mock-ups and the full-scale wooden mock-up in February 1956, the RCAF demanded additional changes, selecting the advanced RCA-Victor &quot;Astra&quot; fire-control system firing the equally advanced United States Navy Sparrow II in place of the MX-1179 and Falcon combination. Avro vocally objected on the grounds that neither of these were even in testing at that point, whereas both the MX-1179 and Falcon were almost ready for production and would have been nearly as effective for &quot;a very large saving in cost&quot;. The Astra proved to be problematic as the system ran into a lengthy period of delays, and when the USN cancelled the Sparrow II in 1956, Canadair was quickly brought in to continue the Sparrow program in Canada, although they expressed grave concerns about the project as well and the move added yet more expense.

===Rollout and flight testing===
Go-ahead on the production was given in 1955. The rollout of the first CF-105, marked as RL-201, took place on 4 October 1957. The company had planned to capitalize on the event, inviting more than guests to the occasion. Unfortunately for Avro, the media and public attention for the Arrow rollout was dwarfed by the launch of Sputnik the same day.

The J75 engine was slightly heavier than the PS-13, and therefore required ballast to be placed in the nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system was not ready, and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment.

RL-201 first flew on 25 March 1958 with Chief Development Test Pilot S/L Janusz Żurakowski at the controls. Four more J75-powered Mk 1s were delivered in the next 18 months. The test flights, limited to &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; and assessing flight characteristics, revealed no serious design faults. The CF-105 demonstrated excellent handling throughout the flight envelope, in large part due to the natural qualities of the delta-wing, but responsibility can also be attributed to the Arrow&#x27;s Stability Augmentation System. The aircraft went supersonic on its third flight and, on the seventh, broke at while climbing. A top speed of Mach 1.98 was achieved, and this was not at the limits of its performance. An Avro report made public in 2015 clarifies that during the highest speed flight, the Arrow reached Mach 1.90 in steady level flight, and an indicated Mach number of 1.95 was recorded in a dive. Estimates up to Mach 1.98 likely originated from an attempt to compensate for lag error, which was expected in diving flight.

Although no major problems were encountered during the initial testing phase, some minor issues with the landing gear and flight control system had to be rectified. The former problem was partly due to the tandem main landing gear being very narrow, in order to fit into the wings; the leg shortened in length and rotated as it was stowed. During one landing incident, the chain mechanism (used to shorten the gear) in the Mark 1 gear jammed, resulting in incomplete rotation. In a second incident with Arrow 202 on 11 November 1958, the flight control system commanded elevons full down at landing; the resulting reduction in weight on the gears reduced the effective tire friction, ultimately resulting in brake lockup and subsequent gear collapse. A photograph taken of the incident proved that inadvertent flight control activation had caused the accident. The only occasion when a test flight was diverted occurred on 2 February 1959, when a Trans-Canada Airlines Vickers Viscount crash-landed in Toronto, necessitating a landing at RCAF Trenton.

The stability augmentation system also required much fine-tuning. Although the CF-105 was not the first aircraft to use such a system, it was one of the first of its kind, and was problematic. By February 1959, the five aircraft had completed the majority of the company test program and were progressing to the RCAF acceptance trials.

===Political issues===
From 1953, some senior Canadian military officials at the chiefs of staffs began to question the program. The chiefs of staff of the army and navy were both strongly opposed to the Arrow, since &quot;substantial funds were being diverted to the air force&quot;, while Air Marshal Hugh Campbell, RCAF Chief of Staff, backed it right up until its cancellation. In June 1957, when the governing Liberals lost the federal election and a Progressive Conservative government under John Diefenbaker took power, the aircraft&#x27;s prospects began to noticeably change. Diefenbaker had campaigned on a platform of reining in what the Conservatives claimed was &quot;rampant Liberal spending&quot;. Nonetheless, by 1958, the parent company had become Canada&#x27;s third largest business enterprise and had primary interests in rolling stock, steel and coal, electronics, and aviation with 39 different companies under the A. V. Roe Canada banner.

In August 1957, the Diefenbaker government signed the NORAD (North American Air Defense) Agreement with the United States, making Canada a partner with American command and control. The USAF was in the process of completely automating their air defence system with the SAGE project, and offered Canada the opportunity to share this sensitive information for the air defence of North America. One aspect of the SAGE system was the Bomarc nuclear-tipped anti-aircraft missile. This led to studies on basing Bomarcs in Canada in order to push the defensive line further north, even though the deployment was found to be extremely costly. Deploying the missiles alone was expected to cost C$164 million, while SAGE would absorb another C$107 million, not counting the cost of improvements to radar; in all, it was projected to raise Canada&#x27;s defence spending by &quot;as much as 25 to 30%&quot;, according to George Pearkes, the minister of national defence.

Defence against ballistic missiles was also becoming a priority. The existence of &quot;Sputnik&quot; had also raised the possibility of attacks from space, and, as the year progressed, word of a &quot;missile gap&quot; began spreading. An American brief of the meeting with Pearkes records his concern that Canada could not afford defensive systems against both ballistic missiles and manned bombers. It is also said Canada could afford the Arrow or Bomarc/SAGE, but not both.

By 11 August 1958, Pearkes requested cancellation of the Arrow, but the Cabinet Defence Committee (CDC) refused. Pearkes tabled it again in September and recommended installation of the Bomarc missile system. The latter was accepted, but again the CDC refused to cancel the entire Arrow program. The CDC wanted to wait until a major review on 31 March 1959. They cancelled the Sparrow/Astra system in September 1958. Efforts to continue the program through cost-sharing with other countries were then explored. In 1959, Pearkes would say the ballistic missile was the greater threat, and Canada purchased Bomarc &quot;in lieu of more airplanes&quot;.

==Operational history==

===Foreign interest===
Canada unsuccessfully tried to sell the Arrow to the US and Britain. The aircraft industry in both countries was considered a national interest and the purchase of foreign designs was rare.

Nevertheless, from 1955 onwards, the UK had shown considerable interest in the Arrow. Desiring a high-performance interceptor like the Arrow, the RAF began the F.155 program in 1955, projecting a service entry date of 1962. As the program continued, it was clear the aircraft would not be ready by that date. It was also clear that new versions of the Soviet M-4 bomber would be available in 1959 that would outperform their existing Gloster Javelins, leaving a several-year gap where the RAF would have no effective anti-bomber force. Attention turned to interim designs that could be in service by the late 1950s to cover this period. At first, consideration was given to the thin-wing Javelin that would provide moderate supersonic performance, along with the extremely high performance but short range Saunders-Roe SR.177.

A new round of development produced an improved Mach 1.6 version of the thin-wing Javelin, and the Arrow was put aside for the time. But it was soon clear that the new Javelin would not enter service until at least 1961, too late to stop the new M-4s and with the F.155 designs coming on only two years later. In April 1956, the UK&#x27;s Air Council recommended a purchase of 144 Arrows to fill the role of the thin-wing Javelin. These would be powered by UK engines; the Bristol Olympus 7R – thrust dry, with reheat, the Rolls-Royce Conway Stage 4 – thrust dry, with reheat, or de Havilland Gyron – thrust dry, with reheat.

Procurement of the Arrow from Canada, and setting up a production line in the UK, was studied. The unit price per aircraft built in the UK was estimated at £220,000 each for a production run of 100 aircraft, as opposed to the estimate of £150,000 per aircraft for the thin wing Javelin. The CF-105 would serve as a stopgap until the F.155 project came to fruition, but with the F.155 due in 1963 and the Arrow not likely to reach the RAF before 1962, there was little point in proceeding.

The infamous 1957 Defence White Paper, described as &quot;the biggest change in military policy ever made in normal times&quot;, led to the cancellation of almost all British manned fighter aircraft then in development, and completely curtailed any likelihood of a purchase. In January 1959, the UK&#x27;s final answer was no; Britain countered with an offer to sell Canada the English Electric Lightning.

The French government expressed an interest in the Iroquois engine for an enlarged version of the Dassault Mirage IV bomber, the Mirage IVB. This was one of several engines being considered, including the Olympus, with an order for 300 Iroquois being considered. Acting on media speculation that the Iroquois engine program was also in jeopardy of being cancelled, the French government chose to end negotiations in October 1958 and opted for an upgraded version of the indigenous Snecma Atar, instead. There was never an explanation for this decision offered by the French government, even after Avro tried to offer the Iroquois as a private venture.

In the US, the 1954 interceptor program was well underway, and would ultimately introduce the Convair F-106 Delta Dart, an aircraft with many similarities to the Arrow. More advanced designs were also being considered, notably the Mach 3 Republic XF-103, and by the time the Arrow was flying, the much more advanced North American XF-108. Both of these programs were cancelled during the mock-up stage, as it was believed the need for a manned interceptor of very high performance simply did not exist as the Soviets were moving their strategic force to ICBMs. This argument added weight to the justification for cancelling the Arrow. In 1958, Avro Aircraft Limited president and general manager Fred Smye elicited a promise from the USAF to &quot;supply, free, the fire control system and missiles and if they would allow the free use of their flight test centre at ... Edwards AFB.&quot;

===Cancellation===
The Arrow&#x27;s cancellation was announced on 20 February 1959. The day became known as &quot;Black Friday&quot; in the Canadian aviation industry. Diefenbaker claimed the decision was based on &quot;a thorough examination&quot; of threats and defensive measures, and the cost of defensive systems. More specifically, the cost would have needed to be amortized over hundreds of manufactured models. At the time the trend was &quot;away from conventional bombers&quot; that the Avro Arrow could intercept and &quot;towards atmospheric weapons like intercontinental ballistic missiles&quot;, according to Global News. As a result, the foreign demand for the Avro Arrow had declined substantially. Canada&#x27;s alternative to the Arrow was to purchase some American McDonnell F-101 Voodoo interceptors and Bomarc B missiles.

The decision immediately put 14,528 Avro employees, as well as nearly 15,000 other employees in the Avro supply chain of outside suppliers, out of work. Declassified records show Avro management was caught unprepared by the suddenness of the announcement by the government; while executives were aware that the program was in jeopardy, they expected it to continue until the March review. It was widely believed during this lead-up to the review, the first Arrow Mk 2, RL-206, would be prepared for an attempt at both world speed and altitude records.

An attempt was made to provide the completed Arrows to the National Research Council of Canada as high-speed test aircraft. The NRC refused, noting that without sufficient spare parts and maintenance, as well as qualified pilots, the NRC could make no use of them. A similar project initiated by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Boscombe Down) had resulted in Avro vice-president (engineering) Jim Floyd&#x27;s preparing a transatlantic ferry operation. This proposal, like others from the United States, was never realized.

===Aftermath===
Within two months of the project cancellation, all aircraft, engines, production tooling and technical data were ordered scrapped. Officially, the reason given for the destruction order from cabinet and the chiefs of staff was to destroy classified and &quot;secret&quot; materials used in the Arrow and Iroquois programs. The action has been attributed to Royal Canadian Mounted Police fears that a Soviet &quot;mole&quot; had infiltrated Avro, later confirmed to some degree in the Mitrokhin Archives. 

Rumours had circulated that Air Marshal W. A. Curtis, a World War I ace who headed Avro, had ignored Diefenbaker and spirited one of the Arrows away to be saved for posterity. These rumours were given life in a 1968 interview, when Curtis was asked directly if the rumour was true. He replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to answer that.&quot; He proceeded to question the wisdom of printing the story of a missing Arrow, and wondered whether it would be safe to reveal the existence of a surviving airframe only nine years later. &quot;If it is in existence it may have to wait another 10 years. Politically it may cause a lot of trouble.&quot; The legend endures that one of the prototypes remains intact somewhere.

Following the cancellation of the Avro Arrow project, CF-105 chief aerodynamicist Jim Chamberlin led a team of 25 engineers to NASA&#x27;s Space Task Group to become lead engineers, program managers, and heads of engineering in NASA&#x27;s manned space programs—projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo. The Space Task Group team eventually grew to 32 Avro engineers and technicians, and became emblematic of what many Canadians viewed as a &quot;brain drain&quot; to the United States. Among the former Arrow team engineers to go south were Tecwyn Roberts (NASA&#x27;s first flight dynamics officer on Project Mercury and later director of networks at the Goddard Space Flight Center), John Hodge (flight director and manager on the cancelled Space Station Freedom project), Dennis Fielder (director of the Space Station Task Force, later the Space Station), Owen Maynard (chief of the LM engineering office in the Apollo Program Office), Bruce Aikenhead, and Rod Rose (technical assistant for the Space Shuttle program). Many other engineers, including Jim Floyd, found work in either the UK or the United States. Work undertaken by both Avro Canada and Floyd benefited supersonic research at Hawker Siddeley, Avro Aircraft&#x27;s UK parent, and contributed to programs such as the HSA.1000 supersonic transport design studies, influential in the design of the Concorde.

In 1961, the RCAF obtained 66 McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo aircraft, one of the American designs the RCAF originally rejected, to serve in the role originally intended for the Avro Arrow. The controversy surrounding this acquisition, and Canada&#x27;s acquiring nuclear weapons for the Voodoos and Bomarcs, eventually contributed to the collapse of the Diefenbaker government in 1963.

Although nearly everything connected to the CF-105 and Orenda Iroquois programs was destroyed, some were saved and are on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa: the cockpit and nose gear of RL-206, the first Mk 2 Arrow, and two outer panels of RL-203&#x27;s wings, alongside an Iroquois engine.

At the time of its cancellation, with specifications comparable to then-current offerings from American and Soviet design bureaus, the Arrow was considered by one aviation industry observer to be one of the most advanced aircraft in the world. According to Bill Gunston:

The Arrow&#x27;s cancellation eventually led to the end of Avro Aircraft Limited (Canada), and its president and general manager, Crawford Gordon Jr., was fired shortly afterward. In 1962, the Hawker Siddeley Group formally dissolved A. V. Roe Canada and transferred all its assets to Hawker Siddeley&#x27;s newly formed subsidiary, Hawker Siddeley Canada. 

The nose cone section of Avro Arrow RL-206, currently on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa, was smuggled out of the Avro Aircraft plant in Malton by members of the RCAF Flying Personnel Medical Establishment, a detachment of RCAF Station Downsview on Avenue Road in Toronto, where it resided for many years and was employed in high-altitude work. The commanding officer of the Flying Personnel Medical Establishment, Wing Commander Roy Stubbs, provides this prologue to the former aircraft:

Around 2011, a new version of the Avro Arrow was privately proposed as an alternative to a Canadian purchase of F-35 aircraft. The proposal, promoted by former Canadian Forces infantry officer Lewis MacKenzie, was rejected by Ottawa in 2012 as being too risky, too costly and too time-consuming given the need to re-engineer the 1950s-era aircraft with modern communication, targeting and stealth features. Member of Parliament and former Canadian Forces fighter pilot Laurie Hawn described the CF-105 as having been advanced 50 years prior, but &quot;hopelessly behind its time&quot; in 2012.

==Variants==

===Mark 1===
The Arrow Mark 1 was the initial version powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney J75 turbojet engines that produced of thrust each. The Mk 1 was used for development and flight testing. Five were completed.

===Mark 2===
The Mk 2 version was to be fitted with the Orenda PS-13 Iroquois engines and would be evaluated by RCAF acceptance pilots as well as Avro test pilots. The new PS-13S engines were designed to produce each. The Astra/Sparrow fire control system had been terminated by the government in September 1958 with all aircraft to employ the Hughes/Falcon combination. At the time of cancellation of the entire program, the first Arrow Mk 2, RL-206, was ready for taxi trials; Avro expected it to break the world speed record, but it never flew.

Top speed would have been limited by atmospheric frictional heating, according to project engineer James Floyd, &quot;[t]he aluminum alloy structure which we favoured was good for speeds greater than a Mach number of 2.&quot;

===Other designs===
Avro Canada had a wide range of advanced Arrow variants under development at the time of project cancellation. Frequent mention is made of an Arrow that could have been capable of Mach 3, similar to the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25. This was not the production version, but one of the design studies, and would have been a greatly modified version of the Arrow Mk 2, featuring revised engine inlets and extensive use of carbon steel and titanium to withstand airframe heating. The Mark 2A and Mark 3 were also to have updated engines, capable of producing each, increasing the maximum takeoff weight by and flight ceiling to 70,000 ft.

===Replicas===
A replica Arrow built by Allan Jackson was used in &quot;The Arrow&quot;, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) production. He began building a full-scale replica of the Arrow in 1989, and was approached by the producers of the Arrow miniseries in 1996, then about 70% complete, who made an offer to complete the construction if the replica could be used for the production. It was used on the miniseries and several public appearances at air shows. The replica was later donated to the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in his home town of Wetaskiwin, Alberta. While in a temporary outdoor collection, it was damaged in a wind storm in 2009. It has since been repaired, but is no longer on public display.

The Avro Museum, based out of Calgary/Springbank Airport (CYBW) west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, is building a 2/3rd scale, manned, high performance flying replica of the Avro Arrow (officially known as ARROW II) to Canadian Aviation Experimental Aircraft Regulations in order to become an airshow demonstration aircraft. Construction began in October 2007, and by 2012 the fuselage was completed and passed its first MDRA inspection, and now has a serial number. Powered by a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney JT-15D-4s, the ARROW II is to have a top speed of approximately 500 knots and a range of 1,800 miles. Current projections show a final cost of the project at approximately one million dollars and it was hoped that ground tests would start in about 2016 with the first flight to follow. The 2018 Annual report from the museum updates the previous predictions, and states

We look forward to more exciting progress in the coming year as we work towards the goal of having the Arrow II on its landing gear and able to be presented as a work in progress static display at the 2019 Springbank Airshow.

The Canadian Air and Space Museum (CASM), previously located at the Toronto/Downsview Airport (CYZD), featured a full-size replica Arrow built by volunteers with materials supplied by local aerospace firms. With a metal structure, the replica features many authentic-looking components including landing gear constructed by Messier-Dowty, the original Arrow primary landing gear sub-contractor. Painted by Bombardier Inc. at their Downview plant in the colours of Arrow 25203, the Arrow replica was rolled out for a media event on 28 September 2006 and was on public display on 8–9 October 2006 to commemorate the 49th anniversary of the original aircraft&#x27;s rollout in 1957. CASM was closed in 2011 when the hangar was rebuilt for use by a college.

This replica was in storage at Toronto Pearson Intl Airport (CYYZ) after being displayed at the Toronto International Centre (across the road from where the actual aircraft were built) for a technology trade show that ran from 30 September to 4 October 2013. In late 2019, Milan Kroupa brought the replica to Edenvale Airport (CNV8), south of Georgian Bay in Southern Ontario. It is currently on display in a hangar, with weekly showings to the public.

===Scale models===

Between 1954 and 1957, nine Avro Arrow models, scaled at one-eighth size or about long, are believed to have been launched, using rockets, over Lake Ontario from Point Petre in Prince Edward County, Ontario as part of the process for testing the hull design. (Two others were launched in Virginia.) They travelled at supersonic speeds as onboard sensors sent data back to shore. After many attempts to find the models, a new search was started in late July 2017. The Raise the Arrow project, operated by OEX Recovery Group Incorporated, was a joint venture by several companies, the Canadian Coast Guard and the Royal Canadian Military Institute. A Thunderfish autonomous submarine, equipped with an AquaPix interferometric synthetic aperture sonar, was being used to survey the relevant area of the lake bottom. Any scale models found will be restored and displayed at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa and the National Air Force Museum of Canada in Trenton, Ontario.

In September 2017, the Raise the Arrow Project confirmed the discovery of one of the 1/8 scale Delta Test Vehicle (DTV) models at the bottom of Lake Ontario. It was recovered in August 2018. The model was restored and has been on display at the Canadian Aviation and Space Museum since 2019. The search for one of the more advanced Arrow test models, in cooperation with the Royal Canadian Air Force, continued. In September 2020, OEX announced that a piece of another test model had been discovered; the Project was working on a method to recover that piece and to find other pieces of the same wreck.

=== &quot;Destroyed&quot; plans re-discovered ===
On January 6, 2020, CBC News announced that the Arrow&#x27;s plans, long thought to have been destroyed, were kept. Ken Barnes, a senior draftsman on the project in 1959, was ordered to destroy all documents related to the Avro Arrow project. Instead, he quietly took the blueprints home where they remained stored for decades. The blueprints were on display in the &quot;Touch the Sky: The Story of Avro Canada&quot; exhibit at the Diefenbaker Canada Centre at the University of Saskatchewan until April 2020.

In 2021, the National Research Council of Canada digitized and released 595 Avro Arrow reports stored in their rare book room and the NRC Archives, both located in Ottawa.

=== Legacy ===

==Notable appearances in media==


In 1997, the CBC broadcast their two-part miniseries, &quot;The Arrow&quot;. The production used a combination of archival film, remote-control flying models and computer animation for the static, ground and flying sequences. Although highly acclaimed, receiving praise from film historian and former Avro employee Elwy Yost and winner of numerous awards including the Gemini that year, the miniseries was also criticized for its &quot;docu-drama&quot; style and departing from a strict factual account. The continued rebroadcasts and accompanying DVD releases have re-animated the controversy over the Arrow&#x27;s cancellation and introduced the story to a new generation.

<text>DAF Trucks is a Dutch truck manufacturing company and a division of Paccar. DAF originally stood for &quot;van Doorne&#x27;s Aanhangwagen Fabriek&quot;. Its headquarters and main plant are in Eindhoven. Cabs and axle assemblies are produced at its Westerlo plant in Belgium. Some of the truck models sold with the DAF brand are designed and built by Leyland Trucks at its Leyland plant in the United Kingdom.

==History==

In 1928, Hubert &quot;Hub&quot; van Doorne founded the company &quot;Commanditaire Vennootschap Hub van Doorne&#x27;s Machinefabriek&quot;. His co-founder and investor was A. H. Huenges, managing director of a brewery. Van Doorne had repaired Huenges&#x27; car several times, and Huenges, pleased with his work, offered to finance him in business. Hub started to work in a small workshop on the grounds of the brewery.

In 1932, the company, by then run by Hub and his brother, Wim van Doorne, changed its name to &quot;Van Doorne&#x27;s Aanhangwagen Fabriek&quot; (Van Doorne&#x27;s Trailer Factory), abbreviated to &quot;DAF&quot;. Huenges left the company in 1936 and the DAF company was then completely in the hands of the van Doorne brothers.

DAF developed the Trado conversions to convert 4×2 Ford trucks to an off-road 6×4 drive. One of DAF&#x27;s few armoured vehicles, the &quot;M39 Pantserwagen&quot;, used developments of this Trado drivetrain. M39 production came too late for World War II – in the invasion of the Netherlands (1940) only three saw combat.

After World War II luxury cars and trucks were very scarce. This meant a big opportunity for DAF. In 1949, the company started making trucks, trailers and buses, changing its name to &quot;Van Doorne&#x27;s Automobiel Fabriek&quot; (Van Doorne&#x27;s Automobile Factory). The first lorry model was the DAF A30.

Through the 1950s, DAF was a major supplier to the re-equipping of the Dutch Army&#x27;s softskin vehicles, with models such as the DAF YA-126 and DAF YA-328 &quot;Dikke Daf&quot;. These used the all-wheel drive H-drive developed from the Trado conversions.

In late 1954, Hub van Doorne had the idea to use belt driven continuously variable transmissions (CVT), like so many belt-driven machines in factories, to drive road vehicles. In 1955, DAF produced its first draft of a car belt drive system. Over the next few years, the design was developed and refined. In February 1958, DAF demonstrated a small belt-driven four-seater car at the Dutch car show (the AutoRAI).

The public reaction was very positive and 4,000 cars were ordered. In 1959, DAF started selling the world&#x27;s first car with a CVT, the small four seater DAF 600. This was the first of a series of models to be released in subsequent years, including the DAF 33, DAF 44, DAF 55 and DAF 66, all using the innovative Variomatic transmission system.

In 1967, DAF opened a new plant in Born for car production. The 44 was the first model to be produced there.

In 1972, International Harvester of Chicago bought a 33% stake in DAF (with the Dutch government holding 25% and the Van Doorne family holding the remaining 42%), forming a joint venture. This agreement lasted until 1981. DAF sold its passenger car division, along with what is now the Nedcar factory in Born, in 1975 to the Swedish company Volvo Cars, leaving DAF to concentrate on its successful line of trucks.

In 1987, DAF merged with the Leyland Trucks division of Rover Group (which included Freight Rover), and in June 1989 was floated on the Dutch and London Stock Exchanges as DAF NV. The new company traded as Leyland DAF in the United Kingdom, and as DAF elsewhere.

DAF Bus was split off in 1990 to become a part of United Bus. Following difficulties in the British market, After DAF NV was placed under administration in February 1993, the Dutch operations were sold in a management buyout with the business branded DAF Trucks.

In October 1996 Paccar acquired DAF Trucks. DAF Trucks and Leyland Trucks were rejoined in June 1998, when Paccar also acquired Leyland Trucks. On 9 January 2012, Paccar installed the cornerstone of the new plant in the city of Ponta Grossa, in the state of Paraná, Brazil.

DAF now has a net worth of 1.7 billion dollars.

===Car business===


The first passenger car, the DAF 600, was presented to the public in February 1958. It featured unitary steel construction, with a front mounted, air cooled two cylinder boxer engine driving the rear wheels through a centrifugal clutch and the Variomatic CVT transmission. The way this was constructed eliminated the need for a differential, with the drivebelts taking up the difference of speed in turns.

This acted as a limited-slip differential. The car had independent suspension all around, with MacPherson struts and a transverse leaf spring at the front, and a coil sprung semi trailing arm design at the rear. The first 600s rolled off the production line in the following year. The next model was the 750, featuring a larger twin.

Later, DAF produced a more luxurious type called the Daffodil, divided into three models assigned the numbers DAF 30, DAF 31 and DAF 32. The designation 32 was changed to 33 upon the 1966 release of the 44, a larger middle class vehicle designed by Giovanni Michelotti.

The 44 featured a completely new design aesthetically as well as mechanically, but was of the same layout as the &quot;A types&quot; (the 600, 750, 30, 31, 32 and 33), with the main difference being its two cylinder engine, and its full swing axle rear axle design as opposed to the A type semi trailing arms.

The 1968 DAF 55 carried a bigger water cooled OHV four cylinder engine derived from the Renault 8 Cleon engine. Its body design was altered from the 44 by a new front which accommodated the longer engine and radiator, bigger taillights, and a more plush interior. The front suspension was changed from a transverse leaf spring to MacPherson struts with torsion springs and an antiroll bar.

The DAF 66 was introduced as a successor to the 55. It featured new, boxy styling of the front, and a new rear axle design. The two drive belts now powered a differential, and the axle was changed from a swing axle design to a leaf sprung de Dion axle. It was a major improvement over the (tricky) handling of the swing axles of the earlier 33, 44 and 55 models.

Volvo purchased a 33 percent stake in DAF in December 1972, with the intent of taking a larger interest. They increased their holdings to 75% on 1 January 1975, taking over the company and the Nedcar plant. Volvo dropped the 33 and 44 models, and later rebadged the DAF 66 as the Volvo 66, with bigger bumpers and a safety steering wheel.

The DAF 46 was developed with Volvo&#x27;s assistance, and was basically a 44 with the rear axle of a 66 and a single belt Variomatic (half the 66&#x27;s transmission). A big weakness of this system is that a failed drive belt would cripple the car. The last DAF design, codenamed P900, initially intended to be the DAF 77, was developed during the transition to Volvo ownership and was ultimately launched as the Volvo 300 series in 1976, firstly as the Volvo 343 three door hatchback with the Variomatic transmission.

After initial slow sales, the range was expanded into the 340/360, with a five-door variant and the availability of manual transmission, and the 340/360 range became a sales success, eventually surpassing 1.3 million units by the time production ceased in 1991. The subsequent Volvo 440/460/480 and the first generation S40/V40 models were also made at the Nedcar plant, until Volvo sold its interest to Mitsubishi Motors in 2001, marking the end of Volvo&#x27;s involvement with the former DAF plant after almost thirty years. Today, the plant is now owned by VDL Nedcar, and contract manufactures certain Mini models for BMW.

==== Prototypes and special cars ====
For a small company, DAF made a huge number of prototypes. Also, famous coachbuilders like Giovanni Michelotti and OSI made cars based on DAF mechanicals. For instance, the OSI City Car, which turned into a miniature. There was also Michelotti&#x27;s &quot;Shellette&quot; beach car, which was later modified to use Fiat 850 underpinnings. The Dutch Royal Family used one of these at their Porto Ercole summer residence.

== Truck business ==

DAF produced its first truck, the A30, in 1949. This truck was upgraded in the following years. Their first attempt into the international market was a failure, the 2000DO. Their next truck was the 1964 2600, which became a big seller with its well equipped but practical cabin. They also produced a so-called torpedo front tractor.

In the 1970s, a new modular tilting cab called the F218 was introduced on the F1600/F2000 range of vehicles. Three years later, the wider F241, which featured DAF&#x27;s characteristic three wiper windscreen, was introduced as the DAF 2800. This design lasted until the introduction of the 95 style cab in 1987. There was also a lighter, narrower version called the &#x27;F198 which was introduced in 1972 on the F1200 and F1400, but this short lived model was replaced after only three years. In 1984, DAF truck production was 13,645; this increased to 14,382 in calendar year 1985.

DAF was also one of the first to introduce an intercooled turbocharged diesel engine into their trucks, which in these years became very evident with their 3600. Their largest six cylinder turbodiesel was based on the old Leyland O.680 motor. It was to be DAF&#x27;s standard large engine long into the nineties.

DAF&#x27;s 95 series was launched in 1987, and quickly gained the coveted &#x27;Truck of The Year&#x27; award. The 95 featured an all new cab developed jointly with ENASA of Spain called Cabtec, a revised version of the 11.6-litre ATI engine, rated at 310, 350, or 380 hp (metric), and 16-speed ZF Friedrichshafen gearbox. On the Continent, Eaton&#x27;s Twinsplitter gearbox was an option. A full range of axle configurations were offered, to suit every operating requirement.

Much attention was paid to soundproofing; the gear linkage for example was telescopic, whilst in-cab noise levels on the 95 put many luxury saloons to shame. An update in 1991 saw new power ratings of 329, 364, and 401 hp; – a 430 hp variant, along with low deck tractor unit models and revised interior trim, were introduced in the spring of 1992.

Two years later, after an intensive study of the ultra long haul market sector, DAF unveiled the 95.500 Super Spacecab at the 1994 RAI show. The 95 series cabin had gained height and length, and sat atop Cummins&#x27; 14-litre N14, rated at 507 bhp. ZF&#x27;s new Aluminium cased 16S221 gearbox was fitted, with optional Intarder. An innovation was the hydraulic gearshift developed with Konsberg of Norway.

Within an overall height of 3.85m, the Super boasted an interior height of 2.25m, a luxury bunk with generous stowage space underneath, and a full range of options included microwave, fridge, and a television/video system. The 95.500 was available as a 4x2 tractor or drawbar rigid, with LHD only, though the Super Spacecab was available on 11.6-litre engined models. The 95.500 is now a very rare truck, which is surprising given the original list price of £87,650.

The basic cab design remains in production to this day, latterly as the 95XF and now the XF105, although both these developments of the original 95 are totally different machines under the skin. Other vehicles in the DAF range have included the inherited from Leyland Trucks Roadrunner (Badged DAF 600, 800, 1000 on the Continent) which evolved into the 45 Series, the cab of which was used on the 18 ton gross 55, also as a military spec 4×4.

An all new medium to heavyweight line up debuted in the end of 1992, the 65, 75 and 85 utilising the same wedge shaped cab. Powered by DAF&#x27;s , and engines, some novel styling details featured, while the 85 Series&#x27; cab sat higher on the chassis to clear the WS engine.

A short lived model was the 1990 to 1993 80 Series, using the T45 Roadtrain cab acquired from the Leyland Trucks takeover, fitted with the ATI driveline. Also offered for a short period was the 3200, basically a remodelled 2800 with the corporate style, three bar grille.

There is a DAF LF45 hybrid version, which was presented by DAF at the IAA 2010 in Hannover.

===Tatra===
In August 2011, DAF announced it had built up a 19% stake in Tatra, which will use DAF cabs and Paccar engines. DAF dealers will sell Tatra off-road trucks.

==Motorsport==
===Cars===

DAF cars had the image of being slow. The company tried to change this image with entries in rallies and races, such as their entry in the London–Sydney Marathon.

They were pioneers with continuously variable automatic transmission called Variomatic.

A DAF car was used in Albie Mangle&#x27;s &quot;World Safari&quot; movie of 1977.

===Truck racing===
*1980s: DAF trucks started competing in the Dakar Rally, winning in 1982, 1985 and 1987. In the later years, they competed with a twin engine trucks: the 1986 TurboTwin, the 1987 TurboTwin II and the 1988 X1. The later producing a combined power output of .
*1988: Two trucks were entered into the Paris-Dakar rally: the X1 and X2. Jan de Rooy&#x27;s lorry was running third overall, beating the Peugeot 405 T16&#x27;s on speed, when DAF&#x27;s other lorry, driven by Theo van de Rijt, was involved in a crash. His co driver Kees Van Loevezijn was fatally injured, and the other two occupants of the lorry narrowly escaped the same fate. DAF withdrew from the event following the crash.
*1996: DAF started competing in the European Truck Racing Championship series, first not very successful, but by 1999, they almost became champions. Then to everyone&#x27;s surprise, it withdrew.
*2002: DAF competed in the Dakar rally, with Jan de Rooy and his son Gerard.
*2003: DAF competed in the Dakar rally, winning numerous stages before Gerard de Rooy crashed.
*2004: DAF competed in the Dakar rally, powering six race lorries. Jan en Gerard de Rooy, the team Tridec, The team Hans Bekx with two trucks and the GINAF Rally Power team (Note that four trucks were built by DAF, two by GINAF).
*2005: Hans Bekx almost finished second overall in the lorry division, before being removed from the competition because of an irregularity, much to the surprise of the (mostly Dutch) fans.
*2006: Jan and Gerard de Rooy were excluded from the Dakar rally because of paperwork issues.

<text>A crossword (or crossword puzzle) is a word game consisting of a grid of black and white squares, into which solvers enter words or phrases (&quot;entries&quot;) crossing each other horizontally (&quot;across&quot;) and vertically (&quot;down&quot;) according to a set of clues. Each white square is typically filled with one letter, while the black squares are used to separate entries. The first white square in each entry is typically numbered to correspond to its clue. 

Crosswords commonly appear in newspapers and magazines. The earliest crosswords that resemble their modern form were popularized by the &quot;New York World&quot; in the 1910s. Many variants of crosswords are popular around the world, including cryptic crosswords and many language-specific variants.

Crossword construction in modern times usually involves the use of software. Constructors choose a theme (except for themeless puzzles), place the theme answers in a grid which is usually symmetric, fill in the rest of the grid, and then write clues.

A person who constructs or solves crosswords is called a &quot;cruciverbalist&quot;. The word &quot;cruciverbalist&quot; appears to have been coined in the 1970s from the Latin roots &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;cross&#x27;, and &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;word&#x27;.

==American-style crosswords==

Crossword grids such as those appearing in most North American newspapers and magazines consist mainly of solid regions of uninterrupted white squares, separated more sparsely by shaded squares. Every letter is &quot;checked&quot; (i.e., is part of both an &quot;across&quot; word and a &quot;down&quot; word) and usually each answer must contain at least three letters. In such puzzles shaded squares are typically limited to about one-sixth of the total. Crossword grids elsewhere, such as in Britain, South Africa, India and Australia, have a lattice-like structure, with a higher percentage of shaded squares (around 25%), leaving about half the letters in an answer unchecked. For example, if the top row has an answer running all the way across, there will often be no across answers in the second row.

Another tradition in puzzle design (in North America, India, and Britain particularly) is that the grid should have 180-degree rotational symmetry, so that its pattern appears the same if the paper is turned upside down. Most puzzle designs also require that all white cells be orthogonally contiguous (that is, connected in one mass through shared sides, to form a single polyomino).

Substantial variants from the usual forms exist. Two of the common ones are barred crosswords, which use bold lines between squares (instead of shaded squares) to separate answers, and circular designs, with answers entered either radially or in concentric circles. &quot;Free form&quot; crosswords (&quot;criss-cross&quot; puzzles), which have simple, asymmetric designs, are often seen on school worksheets, children&#x27;s menus, and other entertainment for children. Grids forming shapes other than squares are also occasionally used.

Puzzles are often one of several standard sizes. For example, many weekday newspaper puzzles (such as the American &quot;New York Times&quot; crossword puzzle) are 15×15 squares, while weekend puzzles may be 21×21, 23×23, or 25×25. The &quot;New York Times&quot; puzzles also set a common pattern for American crosswords by increasing in difficulty throughout the week: their Monday puzzles are the easiest and the puzzles get harder each day until Saturday. Their larger Sunday puzzle is about the same level of difficulty as a weekday-size Thursday puzzle. This has led U.S. solvers to use the day of the week as a shorthand when describing how hard a puzzle is: e.g. an easy puzzle may be referred to as a &quot;Monday&quot; or a &quot;Tuesday&quot;, a medium-difficulty puzzle as a &quot;Wednesday&quot;, and a truly difficult puzzle as a &quot;Saturday&quot;.

Typically clues appear outside the grid, divided into an across list and a down list; the first cell of each entry contains a number referenced by the clue lists. For example, the answer to a clue labeled &quot;17 Down&quot; is entered with the first letter in the cell numbered &quot;17&quot;, proceeding down from there. Numbers are almost never repeated; numbered cells are numbered consecutively, usually from left to right across each row, starting with the top row and proceeding downward. Some Japanese crosswords are numbered from top to bottom down each column, starting with the leftmost column and proceeding right.

=== Clues: conventions and types ===

American-style crossword clues, called &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;quick clues&quot; by those more familiar with cryptic puzzles, are often simple definitions of the answers. Often, a straight clue is not in itself sufficient to distinguish between several possible answers, either because multiple synonymous answers may fit or because the clue itself is a homonym (e.g., &quot;Lead&quot; as in to be ahead in a contest or &quot;Lead&quot; as in the element), so the solver must make use of &quot;checks&quot; to establish the correct answer with certainty. For example, the answer to the clue &quot;PC key&quot; for a three-letter answer could be &quot;ESC&quot;, &quot;ALT&quot;, &quot;TAB&quot;, &quot;DEL&quot;, or &quot;INS&quot;, so until a &quot;check&quot; is filled in, giving at least one of the letters, the correct answer cannot be determined.

In most American-style crosswords, the majority of the clues in the puzzle are straight clues, with the remainder being one of the other types described below.

Crossword clues are generally consistent with the solutions. For instance, clues and their solutions should always agree in tense, number, and degree. If a clue is in the past tense, so is the answer: thus &quot;Traveled on horseback&quot; would be a valid clue for the solution &quot;RODE&quot;, but not for &quot;RIDE&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Family members&quot; would be a valid clue for &quot;AUNTS&quot; but not &quot;UNCLE&quot;, while &quot;More joyful&quot; could clue &quot;HAPPIER&quot; but not &quot;HAPPIEST&quot;.

==== Capitalization ====

Capitalization of answer letters is conventionally ignored; crossword puzzles are typically filled in, and their answer sheets published, in all caps. This ensures a proper name can have its initial capital letter checked with a non-capitalizable letter in the intersecting clue.

Some clue examples:
* Fill-in-the-blank clues are often the easiest in a puzzle and a good place to start solving, e.g., &quot;_____ Boleyn&quot; = &quot;ANNE&quot;.
* A question mark at the end of clue usually signals that the clue/answer combination involves some sort of pun or wordplay, e.g., &quot;Grateful?&quot; = &quot;ASHES&quot;, since a grate might be full of them.
* Most widely distributed American crosswords today (e.g., &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, etc.) also contain colloquial answers, i.e., entries in the puzzle grid that try to replicate everyday colloquial language. In such a puzzle one might see phrases such as &quot;WHAT&#x27;S UP&quot;, &quot;AS IF&quot;, or &quot;WHADDYA WANT&quot;.

====Abbreviations====

The constraints of the American-style grid (in which every letter is checked) often require a fair number of answers not to be dictionary words. As a result, the following ways to clue abbreviations and other non-words, although they can be found in &quot;straight&quot; British crosswords, are much more common in American ones:
* Abbreviations, the use of a foreign language, variant spellings, or other unusual word tricks are indicated in the clue. A crossword creator might choose to clue the answer &quot;SEN&quot; (as in the abbreviation for &quot;senator&quot;) as &quot;Washington bigwig: Abbr.&quot; or &quot;Member of Cong.&quot;, with the abbreviation in the clue indicating that the answer is to be similarly abbreviated. The use of &quot;Var.&quot; indicates the answer is a variant spelling (e.g., &quot;EMEER&quot; instead of &quot;EMIR&quot;), while the use of foreign language or a foreign place name within the clue indicates that the answer is also in a foreign language. For example, &quot;ETE&quot; (&quot;&quot;, French for &quot;summer&quot;) might be clued as &quot;Summer, in the Sorbonne&quot;. &quot;ROMA&quot; could be clued as &quot;Italia&#x27;s capital&quot;, whereas the clue &quot;Italy&#x27;s capital&quot; would indicate the English spelling &quot;Rome&quot;.
* The eight possible abbreviations for a position on a compass, e.g., &quot;NNW&quot; (north-northwest) or &quot;ESE&quot; (east-southeast), occur with some frequency. They can be clued as simply &quot;Compass point&quot;, where the desired answer is determined by a combination of logic—since the third letter can be only E or W, and the second letter can be only N or S—and a process of elimination using checks. Alternatively, compass point answers are more frequently clued as &quot;XXX to YYY direction&quot;, where XXX and YYY are two place names. For example, &quot;SSW&quot; might be clued as &quot;New York to Washington DC dir.&quot;. Similarly, a clue such as &quot;Right on the map&quot; means &quot;EAST&quot;. A clue could also consist of objects that point a direction, e.g., &quot;vane dir.&quot; or &quot;windsock dir.&quot;.
* Roman numerals, and arithmetic involving them, frequently appear as well; the clue &quot;IV times III&quot; (4×3) would yield &quot;XII&quot; (12).
* In addition, partial answers are allowed in American-style crosswords, where the answer represents part of a longer phrase. For example, the clue &quot;Mind your _____ Qs&quot; gives the answer &quot;PSAND&quot; (Ps and).
* Non-dictionary phrases are also allowed in answers. Thus, the clue &quot;Mocked&quot; could result in the grid entry &quot;LAUGHED AT&quot;.

==== Themes ====
Many American crossword puzzles feature a &quot;theme&quot; consisting of a number of long entries (generally three to five in a standard 15×15-square &quot;weekday-size&quot; puzzle) that share some relationship, type of pun, or other element in common. As an example, the &quot;New York Times&quot; crossword of April 26, 2005 by Sarah Keller, edited by Will Shortz, featured five themed entries ending in the different parts of a tree: &quot;SQUARE ROOT&quot;, &quot;TABLE LEAF&quot;, &quot;WARDROBE TRUNK&quot;, &quot;BRAIN STEM&quot;, and &quot;BANK BRANCH&quot;.

The above is an example of a category theme, where the theme elements are all members of the same set. Other types of themes include:
* Quote themes, featuring a famous quote broken up into parts to fit in the grid (and usually clued as &quot;Quote, part 1&quot;, &quot;Quote, part 2&quot;, etc.)
* Rebus themes, where multiple letters or even symbols occupy a single square in the puzzle (e.g., &quot;BERMUDA&quot;Δ)
* Addition themes, where theme entries are created by adding a letter, letters, or word(s) to an existing word or phrase. For example, &quot;Crucial pool shot?&quot; = &quot;CRITICAL MASSE&quot; (formed by taking the phrase &quot;critical mass&quot; and adding an &quot;e&quot; on the end. All the theme entries in a given puzzle must be formed by the same process (so another entry might be &quot;Greco-Roman buddy?&quot; = &quot;WRESTLING MATE&quot;—&quot;wrestling mat&quot; with an &quot;e&quot; added on). An example of a multiple-letter addition (and one that does not occur at the end of the entry) might be &quot;Crazy about kitchen storage?&quot; = &quot;CABINET FEVER&quot; (derived from &quot;cabin fever&quot;).
* Subtraction themes, the reverse of the above, where letters are removed to make a new word or phrase.
* Compound themes, where the starts or ends of the theme entries can all precede or follow another word, which is given elsewhere in the puzzle. For example, a puzzle with theme entries that begin with &quot;PAPER&quot;, &quot;BALL&quot;, and &quot;WATER&quot; and elsewhere in the puzzle, the word &quot;BOY&quot; clued as &quot;Word that can follow the start of [theme entries]&quot;.
* Anniversary or tribute themes, commemorating a specific person, place, or event. For example, on October 7, 2011 &quot;The New York Times&quot; crossword commemorated the life of Apple CEO Steve Jobs who had died on October 5. Theme entries related to Jobs&#x27; life included &quot;MACINTOSH&quot;, &quot;PIXAR&quot;, &quot;THINK DIFFERENT&quot;, &quot;CREATIVE GENIUS&quot;, &quot;STEVE JOBS&quot;, and &quot;APPLE&quot;.
* Synonym themes, where the theme entries all contain synonyms, e.g., a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; puzzle featuring a set of theme entries that contain the words &quot;RAVEN&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, all synonyms for &quot;black&quot;.
* Numerous other types have been identified, including spoonerisms, poems, shifted letters, rhyming phrases, puns, homophones, and combinations of two or more of other types of themes.

The themed crossword puzzle was invented in 1958 by Harold T. Bers, an advertising executive and frequent contributor to &quot;The New York Times&quot; crossword.

The Simon &amp; Schuster Crossword Puzzle Series has published many unusually themed crosswords. &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot;, by Sam Bellotto Jr., incorporates a Caesar cipher cryptogram as the theme; the key to breaking the cipher is the answer to 1Across. Another unusual theme requires the solver to use the answer to a clue as another clue. The answer to &quot;that&quot; clue is the real solution.

==== Indirect clues ====

Many puzzles feature clues involving wordplay which are to be taken metaphorically or in some sense other than their literal meaning, requiring some form of lateral thinking. Depending on the puzzle creator or the editor, this might be represented either with a question mark at the end of the clue or with a modifier such as &quot;maybe&quot; or &quot;perhaps&quot;. In more difficult puzzles, the indicator may be omitted, increasing ambiguity between a literal meaning and a wordplay meaning. Examples:
* &quot;Half a dance&quot; could clue &quot;CAN&quot; (half of &quot;CANCAN&quot;) or &quot;CHA&quot; (half of &quot;CHACHA&quot;).
* If taken literally, &quot;Start of spring&quot; could clue &quot;MAR&quot; (for March), but it could also clue &quot;ESS&quot;, the spelled-out form of the starting letter &quot;S&quot;.
* &quot;Nice summer?&quot; clues &quot;ETE&quot;, summer in Nice, France (&quot;&quot; being French for &quot;summer&quot;), rather than a nice (pleasant) summer. This clue also takes advantage of the fact that in American-style crosswords, the initial letter of a clue is always capitalized, whether or not it is a proper noun. In this clue, the initial capitalization further obscures whether the clue is referring to &quot;nice&quot; as in &quot;pleasant&quot; or &quot;Nice&quot; as in the French city.
* &quot;Pay addition&quot;, taken literally, clues &quot;BONUS&quot;. When taken as an indirect clue, however, it could also clue &quot;OLA&quot; (the &quot;addition&quot; of &quot;-ola&quot; to &quot;pay-&quot; results in &quot;PAYOLA&quot;).

==== Other clue variations ====
Any type of puzzle may contain &quot;cross-references&quot;, where the answer to one clue forms part of another clue, in which it is referred to by number and direction. E.g., a puzzle might have 1-across clued as &quot;Central character in The Lord of the Rings&quot; = &quot;FRODO&quot;, with 17-down clued as &quot;Precious object for 1-Across&quot; = &quot;RING&quot;.

When an answer is composed of multiple or hyphenated words, some crosswords (especially in Britain) indicate the structure of the answer. For example, &quot;(3,5)&quot; after a clue indicates that the answer is composed of a three-letter word followed by a five-letter word. Most American-style crosswords do not provide this information.

=== Metapuzzles ===
Some crossword designers have started including a metapuzzle, or &quot;meta&quot; for short, a second puzzle within the completed puzzle. After the player has correctly solved the crossword puzzle in the usual fashion, the solution forms the basis of a second puzzle. The designer usually includes a hint to the metapuzzle. For instance, the puzzle &quot;Eight Isn&#x27;t Enough&quot; by Matt Gaffney gives the clue &quot;This week&#x27;s contest answer is a three-word phrase whose second word is &#x27;or&#x27;.&quot; The crossword solution includes the entries &quot;BROUGHT TO NAUGHT&quot;, &quot;MIGHT MAKES RIGHT&quot;, &quot;CAUGHT A STRAIGHT&quot;, and &quot;HEIGHT AND WEIGHT&quot;, which are all three-word phrases with two words ending in -ght. The solution to the meta is a similar phrase in which the middle word is &quot;or&quot;: &quot;FIGHT OR FLIGHT&quot;.

Since September 2015, the Wall Street Journal Friday crossword has featured a crossword contest metapuzzle, with the prize of a WSJ mug going to a reader randomly chosen from among those submitting the correct answer.

=== Schrödinger or quantum puzzles ===
Some puzzle grids contain more than one correct answer for the same set of clues. These are called Schrödinger or quantum puzzles, alluding to the Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat thought experiment in quantum physics. Schrödinger puzzles have frequently been published in venues including &quot;Fireball Crosswords&quot; and &quot;The American Values Club Crosswords&quot;, and at least ten have appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; since the late 1980s. The daily &quot;New York Times&quot; puzzle for November 5, 1996, by Jeremiah Farrell, had a clue for 39 across that read &quot;Lead story in tomorrow&#x27;s newspaper, with 43 Across (!).&quot; The answer for 43 across was ELECTED; depending on the outcome of that day&#x27;s Presidential Election, the answer for 39 across would have been correct with either CLINTON or BOBDOLE, as would each of the corresponding down answers. On September 1, 2016, the daily &quot;New York Times&quot; puzzle by Ben Tausig had four squares which led to correct answers reading both across and down if solvers entered either &quot;M&quot; or &quot;F&quot;. The puzzle&#x27;s theme, GENDERFLUID, was revealed at 37 across in the center of the puzzle: &quot;Having a variable identity, as suggested by four squares in this puzzle.&quot;

== Cryptic crosswords ==

In cryptic crosswords, the clues are puzzles in themselves. A typical clue contains both a definition at the beginning or end of the clue and wordplay, which provides a way to manufacture the word indicated by the definition, and which may not parse logically. Cryptics usually give the length of their answers in parentheses after the clue, which is especially useful with multi-word answers. Certain signs indicate different forms of wordplay. Solving cryptics is harder to learn than standard crosswords, as learning to interpret the different types of cryptic clues can take some practice. In Great Britain and throughout much of the Commonwealth, cryptics of varying degrees of difficulty are featured in many newspapers.

The first crosswords with strictly cryptic clues appeared in the 1920s, pioneered by Edward Powys Mathers. He established the principle of cryptic crossword clues. Cryptic crossword clues consist typically of a definition and some type of word play. Cryptic crossword clues need to be viewed two ways. One is a surface reading and one a hidden meaning. The surface reading is the basic reading of the clue to look for key words and how those words are constructed in the clue. The second way is the hidden meaning. This can be a double definition, an anagram, homophone, or words backwards. There are eight main types of clues in cryptic crosswords.

=== Types of cryptic clues ===
There are several types of wordplay used in cryptics. One is straightforward definition substitution using parts of a word. For example, in one puzzle by Mel Taub, the answer &quot;IMPORTANT&quot; is given the clue &quot;To bring worker into the country may prove significant&quot;. The explanation is that to &quot;import&quot; means &quot;to bring into the country&quot;, the &quot;worker&quot; is a worker &quot;ant&quot;, and &quot;significant&quot; means &quot;important&quot;. Here, &quot;significant&quot; is the straight definition (appearing here at the end of the clue), &quot;to bring worker into the country&quot; is the wordplay definition, and &quot;may prove&quot; serves to link the two. Note that in a cryptic clue, there is almost always only one answer that fits both the definition and the wordplay, so that when one sees the answer, one knows that it is the right answer—although it can sometimes be a challenge to figure out &quot;why&quot; it is the right answer. A good cryptic clue should provide a fair and exact definition of the answer, while at the same time being deliberately misleading.

Another type of wordplay used in cryptics is the use of homophones. For example, the clue &quot;A few, we hear, add up (3)&quot; is the clue for &quot;SUM&quot;. The straight definition is &quot;add up&quot;, meaning &quot;totalize&quot;. The solver must guess that &quot;we hear&quot; indicates a homophone, and so a homophone of a synonym of &quot;A few&quot; (&quot;some&quot;) is the answer. Other words relating to sound or hearing can be used to signal the presence of a homophone clue (e.g., &quot;aloud&quot;, &quot;audibly&quot;, &quot;in conversation&quot;, etc.).

The double meaning is commonly used as another form of wordplay. For example, &quot;Cat&#x27;s tongue (7)&quot; is solved by &quot;PERSIAN&quot;, since this is a type of cat, as well as a tongue, or language. This is the only type of cryptic clue without wordplay—both parts of the clue are a straight definition.

Cryptics often include anagrams, as well. For example, in &quot;Slipped a disc – it&#x27;s cruel (8)&quot; an anagram is indicated by &quot;slipped&quot;, with the definition to aim for being &quot;cruel&quot;. Ignoring all punctuation, &quot;a disc – it&#x27;s&quot; produces &quot;SADISTIC&quot;. Colin Dexter advised that &quot;Usually the indicator will be an adjective (drunk, fancy, unusual, and so on); an adverb (badly, excitedly, unexpectedly); a past participle (altered, broken, jumbled) or indeed any phrase giving a similar meaning.&quot;

Embedded words are another common trick in cryptics. The clue &quot;Bigotry aside, I&#x27;d take him (9)&quot; is solved by &quot;APARTHEID&quot;. The straight definition is &quot;bigotry&quot;, and the wordplay explains itself, indicated by the word &quot;take&quot; (since one word &quot;takes&quot; another): &quot;aside&quot; means APART and I&#x27;d is simply ID, so APART and ID &quot;take&quot; HE (which is, in cryptic crossword usage, a perfectly good synonym for &quot;him&quot;). The answer could be elucidated as APART(HE)ID.

Another common clue type is the &quot;hidden clue&quot; or &quot;container&quot;, where the answer is hidden in the text of the clue itself. For example, &quot;Made a dug-out, buried, and passed away (4)&quot; is solved by &quot;DEAD&quot;. The answer is written in the clue: &quot;maDE A Dug-out&quot;. &quot;Buried&quot; indicates that the answer is embedded within the clue.

There are numerous other forms of wordplay found in cryptic clues. Backwards words can be indicated by words like &quot;climbing&quot;, &quot;retreating&quot;, or &quot;ascending&quot; (depending on whether it is an across clue or a down clue) or by directional indicators such as &quot;going North&quot; (meaning upwards) or &quot;West&quot; (right-to-left); letters can be replaced or removed with indicators such as &quot;nothing rather than excellence&quot; (meaning replace E in a word with O); the letter &quot;I&quot; can be indicated by &quot;me&quot; or &quot;one;&quot; the letter &quot;O&quot; can be indicated by &quot;nought&quot;, &quot;nothing&quot;, &quot;zero&quot;, or &quot;a ring&quot; (since it visually resembles one); the letter &quot;X&quot; might be clued as &quot;a cross&quot;, or &quot;ten&quot; (as in the Roman numeral), or &quot;an illiterate&#x27;s signature&quot;, or &quot;sounds like your old flame&quot; (homophone for &quot;ex&quot;). &quot;Senselessness&quot; is solved by &quot;e&quot;, because &quot;e&quot; is what remains after removing (less) &quot;ness&quot; from &quot;sense&quot;.

With the different types of wordplay and definition possibilities, the composer of a cryptic puzzle is presented with many different possible ways to clue a given answer. Most desirable are clues that are clean but deceptive, with a smooth &quot;surface reading&quot; (that is, the resulting clue looks as natural a phrase as possible). The Usenet newsgroup &quot;rec.puzzles.crosswords&quot; has a number of clueing competitions where contestants all submit clues for the same word and a judge picks the best one.

In principle, each cryptic clue is usually sufficient to define its answer uniquely, so it should be possible to answer each clue without use of the grid. In practice, the use of checks is an important aid to the solver.

== Other variants ==
These are common crossword variants that vary more from a regular crossword than just an unusual grid shape or unusual clues; these crossword variants may be based on different solving principles and require a different solving skill set.

=== Cipher crosswords ===
Cipher crosswords were invented in Germany in the 19th century. Published under various trade names (including Code Breakers, Code Crackers, and Kaidoku), and not to be confused with cryptic crosswords (ciphertext puzzles are commonly known as cryptograms), a cipher crossword replaces the clues for each entry with clues for each white cell of the grid—an integer from 1 to 26 inclusive is printed in the corner of each. The objective, as any other crossword, is to determine the proper letter for each cell; in a cipher crossword, the 26 numbers serve as a cipher for those letters: cells that share matching numbers are filled with matching letters, and no two numbers stand for the same letter. All resultant entries must be valid words. Usually, at least one number&#x27;s letter is given at the outset. English-language cipher crosswords are nearly always pangrammatic (all letters of the alphabet appear in the solution). As these puzzles are closer to codes than quizzes, they require a different skillset; many basic cryptographic techniques, such as determining likely vowels, are key to solving these. Given their pangrammaticity, a frequent start point is locating where &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;U&#x27; must appear.

=== Diagramless crosswords ===
In a diagramless crossword, often called a diagramless for short or, in the UK, a skeleton crossword or carte blanche, the grid offers overall dimensions, but the locations of most of the clue numbers and shaded squares are unspecified. A solver must deduce not only the answers to individual clues, but how to fit together partially built-up clumps of answers into larger clumps with properly set shaded squares. Some of these puzzles follow the traditional symmetry rule, others have left-right mirror symmetry, and others have greater levels of symmetry or outlines suggesting other shapes. If the symmetry of the grid is given, the solver can use it to his/her advantage.

=== Fill-in crosswords ===
A fill-in crossword (also known as crusadex or cruzadex) features a grid and the full list of words to be entered in that grid, but does not give explicit clues for where each word goes. The challenge is figuring out how to integrate the list of words together within the grid so that all intersections of words are valid. Fill-in crosswords may often have longer word length than regular crosswords to make the crossword easier to solve, and symmetry is often disregarded. Fitting together several long words is easier than fitting together several short words because there are fewer possibilities for how the long words intersect together. These types of crosswords are also used to demonstrate artificial intelligence abilities, such as finding solutions to the puzzle based on a set of determined constraints.

=== Cross-figures ===

A cross-figure or crossnumber is the numerical analogy of a crossword, in which the solutions to the clues are numbers instead of words. Clues are usually arithmetical expressions, but can also be general knowledge clues to which the answer is a number or year. There are also numerical fill-in crosswords.

=== Acrostic puzzles ===
An acrostic is a type of word puzzle, in eponymous acrostic form, that typically consists of two parts. The first is a set of lettered clues, each of which has numbered blanks representing the letters of the answer. The second part is a long series of numbered blanks and spaces, representing a quotation or other text, into which the answers for the clues fit. In most forms of the puzzle, the first letters of each correct clue answer, read in order from clue A on down the list, will spell out the author of the quote and the title of the work it is taken from; this can be used as an additional solving aid.

===Arroword===

The arroword is a variant of a crossword that does not have as many black squares as a true crossword, but has arrows inside the grid, with clues preceding the arrows. It has been called the most popular word puzzle in many European countries, and is often called the Scandinavian crossword, as it is believed to have originated in Sweden.

== History ==

The phrase &quot;cross word puzzle&quot; was first written in 1862 by &quot;Our Young Folks&quot; in the United States. Crossword-like puzzles, for example Double Diamond Puzzles, appeared in the magazine &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;, published since 1873. Another crossword puzzle appeared on September 14, 1890, in the Italian magazine &quot;Il Secolo Illustrato della Domenica&quot;. It was designed by Giuseppe Airoldi and titled &quot;Per passare il tempo&quot; (&quot;To pass the time&quot;). Airoldi&#x27;s puzzle was a four-by-four grid with no shaded squares; it included horizontal and vertical clues.

Crosswords in England during the 19th century were of an elementary kind, apparently derived from the word square, a group of words arranged so the letters read alike vertically and horizontally, and printed in children&#x27;s puzzle books and various periodicals.

On December 21, 1913, Arthur Wynne, a journalist born in Liverpool, England, published a &quot;word-cross&quot; puzzle in the &quot;New York World&quot; that embodied most of the features of the modern genre. This puzzle is frequently cited as the first crossword puzzle, and Wynne as the inventor. An illustrator later reversed the &quot;word-cross&quot; name to &quot;cross-word&quot;.

Crossword puzzles became a regular weekly feature in the &quot;New York World&quot;, and spread to other newspapers; the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot;, for example, was publishing them at least as early as 1916 and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; by 1917.
By the 1920s, the crossword phenomenon was starting to attract notice. In October 1922, newspapers published a comic strip by Clare Briggs entitled &quot;Movie of a Man Doing the Cross-Word Puzzle&quot;, with an enthusiast muttering &quot;87 across &#x27;Northern Sea Bird&#x27;!!??!?!!? Hm-m-m starts with an &#x27;M&#x27;, second letter is &#x27;U&#x27; ... I&#x27;ll look up all the words starting with an &#x27;M-U ...&#x27; mus-musi-mur-murd—Hot Dog! Here &#x27;tis! Murre!&quot; In 1923 a humorous squib in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; has a wife ordering her husband to run out and &quot;rescue the papers ... the part I want is blowing down the street.&quot; &quot;What is it you&#x27;re so keen about?&quot; &quot;The Cross-Word Puzzle. Hurry, please, that&#x27;s a good boy.&quot; In &quot;The New Yorker&quot; inaugural issue, from 1925, the &quot;Jottings About Town&quot; section observed, &quot;Judging from the number of solvers in the subway and &#x27;L&#x27; trains, the crossword puzzle bids fair to become a fad with New Yorkers.&quot; Also in 1925, the New York Public Library reported that &quot;The latest craze to strike libraries is the crossword puzzle&quot;, and complained that when &quot;the puzzle &#x27;fans&#x27; swarm to the dictionaries and encyclopedias so as to drive away readers and students who need these books in their daily work, can there be any doubt of the Library&#x27;s duty to protect its legitimate readers?&quot;

The first book of crossword puzzles was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1924, after a suggestion from co-founder Richard Simon&#x27;s aunt. The publisher was initially skeptical that the book would succeed, and only printed a small run at first. The book was promoted with an included pencil, and &quot;This odd-looking book with a pencil attached to it&quot; was an instant hit, leading crossword puzzles to become a craze of 1924. To help promote its books, Simon &amp; Schuster also founded the Amateur Cross Word Puzzle League of America, which began the process of developing standards for puzzle design.

Not all of the attention drawn to the crossword puzzle fad was positive: A 1924 editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; complained of the &quot;sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern, more or less complex. This is not a game at all, and it hardly can be called a sport ... [solvers] get nothing out of it except a primitive form of mental exercise, and success or failure in any given attempt is equally irrelevant to mental development.&quot; A clergyman called the working of crossword puzzles &quot;the mark of a childish mentality&quot; and said, &quot;There is no use for persons to pretend that working one of the puzzles carries any intellectual value with it.&quot; However, another wrote a complete &quot;Bible Cross-Word Puzzle Book&quot;. Also in 1925, &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted that nine Manhattan dailies and fourteen other big newspapers were carrying crosswords, and quoted opposing views as to whether &quot;This crossword craze will positively end by June!&quot; or &quot;The crossword puzzle is here to stay!&quot; In 1925, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted, with approval, a scathing critique of crosswords by &quot;The New Republic&quot;; but concluded that &quot;Fortunately, the question of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer. The craze evidently is dying out fast and in a few months it will be forgotten.&quot; and in 1929 declared, &quot;The cross-word puzzle, it seems, has gone the way of all fads.&quot; In 1930, a correspondent noted that &quot;Together with &quot;The Times&quot; of London, yours is the only journal of prominence that has never succumbed to the lure of the cross-word puzzle&quot; and said that &quot;The craze—the fad—stage has passed, but there are still people numbering it to the millions who look for their daily cross-word puzzle as regularly as for the weather predictions.&quot;

The term &quot;crossword&quot; first appeared in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 1933.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; finally began to publish a crossword puzzle on 15 February 1942, spurred on by the idea that the puzzle could be a welcome distraction from the harsh news of World War II. &quot;The New York Times&quot; first puzzle editor was Margaret Petherbridge Farrar, who was editor from 1942 to 1969. She was succeeded by Will Weng, who was succeeded by Eugene T. Maleska. Since 1993, they have been edited by Will Shortz, the &quot;Times&quot;″ fourth crossword editor.

Simon &amp; Schuster continues to publish the &quot;Crossword Puzzle Book Series&quot; books that it began in 1924, currently under the editorship of John M. Samson. The original series ended in 2007 after 258 volumes. Since 2008, these books are now in the Mega series, appearing three times per year and each featuring 300 puzzles.

The cryptic crossword variation originated in Britain in the mid-1920s. Edward Powys Mathers set the first crossword to use entirely cryptic clues, originally just for the enjoyment of his friends, one of whom, without permission, submitted it to the Saturday &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot;. The editors approached Mathers for more puzzles, and published eleven more of these novel cryptic crosswords. Upon the demise of the Saturday &quot;Westminster&quot;, Mathers began setting puzzles for &quot;The Observer&quot;, beginning a series of 670 cryptic crosswords, which ended only with Mathers&#x27; death in 1939. Mathers set his puzzles under the pen name of Torquemada, after the first Grand Inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition. His successors as &quot;The Observer&quot; cryptic crossword setter followed his example. Derrick Somerset Macnutt, who took over at Mather&#x27;s death, chose the pen name &quot;Ximenes,&quot; an Anglicization of the surname of Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, a Grand Inquisitor in Castile. The current &quot;Observer&quot; cryptic compiler, Jonathan Crowther sets under the name &quot;Azed,&quot; a reversal of Deza, another Grand Inquisitor. Cryptic crosswords are popular in Britain, some British Commonwealth nations, and in a few other countries. Many British newspapers publish both standard and cryptic crosswords.

The cryptic crossword was imported to the US in 1968 by composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim in the &quot;New York&quot; magazine, but never became widespread. From 1977 to 2006, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; regularly featured a cryptic crossword &quot;Puzzler&quot; by the husband and wife team of Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon. From 2006 to 2009, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; puzzler appeared only online. In 2010, Cox and Rathvon&#x27;s efforts began to appear monthly in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. The pair retired at the end of 2023, but the WSJ continues to offer a cryptic crossword each month.

In the United Kingdom, the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; was the first newspaper to publish a crossword on November 2, 1924, a Wynne puzzle adapted for the UK. The first crossword in Britain, according to Tony Augarde in his &quot;Oxford Guide to Word Games&quot; (1984), was in &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for February 1922.
The 2006 documentary &quot;Wordplay&quot;, about enthusiasts of &quot;The New York Times&quot; puzzle, increased public interest in crosswords. It highlighted attendees of Will Shortz&#x27;s American Crossword Puzzle Tournament and other notable crossword enthusiasts, including former US president Bill Clinton and comedian Jon Stewart. Other crossword tournaments in the United States include Lollapuzzoola in New York City and Boswords in Boston.

=== World War II ===

In 1944, Allied security officers were disturbed by the appearance, in a series of crosswords in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, of words that were secret code names for military operations planned as part of Operation Overlord.

Some cryptologists for Bletchley Park were selected after doing well in a crossword-solving competition.

=== Records ===
According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, May 15, 2007, the most prolific crossword compiler is Roger Squires of Ironbridge, Shropshire, UK. On May 14, 2007, he published his 66,666th crossword, equivalent to 2 million clues. He is one of only four setters to have provided cryptic puzzles to &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;. He also holds the record for the longest word ever used in a published crossword—the 58-letter Welsh town Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch clued as an anagram.

Enthusiasts have compiled a number of record-setting achievements in &quot;New York Times&quot; and other venues.
* The lowest word count in a published weekday-size 15x15 puzzle is the June 29, 2013 &quot;The New York Times&quot; crossword by Joe Krozel, with just 50 words.
* The fewest shaded squares in a 15x15 American crossword is 17 (leaving 208 white spaces), set by the July 27, 2012 &quot;Times&quot; crossword by Joe Krozel.
* The record for most crosswords published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; is held by Manny Nosowsky, who has had 241 puzzles in that outlet.
* A N Prahlada Rao, crossword constructor from India, has recorded in the &quot;Limca Book of Records&quot; in 2016 for constructing highest number of crosswords in Indian regional languages. In 2019 his name has mentioned in the &quot;Kalam Book of World Records&quot;.

=== Female crossword constructors ===
Women editors such as Margaret Farrar were influential in the first few decades of puzzle-making, and women constructors such as Bernice Gordon and Elizabeth Gorski have each contributed hundreds of puzzles to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. However, in recent years the number of women constructors has declined. During the years that Will Weng and Eugene Maleska edited the New York Times crossword (1969–1993), women constructors accounted for 35% of puzzles, while during the editorship of Will Shortz (1993–present), this percentage has gone down, with women constructors (including collaborations) accounting for only 15% of puzzles in both 2014 and 2015, 17% of puzzles published in 2016, 13%—the lowest in the &quot;Shortz Era&quot;—in 2017, and 16% in 2018. Several reasons have been given for the decline in women constructors. One explanation is that the gender imbalance in crossword construction is similar to that in related fields, such as journalism, and that more freelance male constructors than females submit puzzles on spec to &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other outlets. Another explanation is that computer-assisted construction and the increased influence of computational approaches in generating word lists may be making crossword construction more like STEM fields in which women are underrepresented for a number of factors. However, it has also been argued that this explanation risks propagating myths about gender and technology. Some have argued that the relative absence of women constructors and editors has had an influence on the content of the puzzles themselves, and that clues and entries can be insensitive regarding language related to gender and race. Margaret Irvine suggested that lack of confidence was a barrier. Several approaches have been suggested to develop more women in the field, including mentoring novice women constructors and encouraging women constructors to publish their puzzles independently.

Crossword venues other than &quot;New York Times&quot; have recently published higher percentages of women than that puzzle. In the spring of 2018, Patti Varol and Amy Reynaldo organized and edited a pack of 18 puzzles constructed by women called &quot;Women of Letters&quot;. Inspired by this, Laura Braunstein and Tracy Bennett launched &quot;The Inkubator&quot;, a &quot;twice-monthly subscription service that will publish crosswords constructed by cis women, trans women, and woman-aligned constructors.&quot; &quot;The Inkubator&quot; raised over $30,000 in its initial Kickstarter campaign, and began publishing puzzles on January 17, 2019. A book of 100 puzzles, &quot;Inkubator Crosswords: 100 Audacious Puzzles by Women and Nonbinary Creators,&quot; was published in 2022. On February 8, 2023, they announced to subscribers that 2023 would be their final year as a subscription service.

== Non-English languages ==

Owing to the large number of words ending with a vowel, Italian crossword-makers have perhaps the most difficult task. The right margin and the bottom can be particularly difficult to put together. From such a perspective, Swedish crossword-makers have a far easier task. Especially in the large picture crosswords, both conjugation of verbs and declension of adjectives and nouns are allowed. A Swedish clue like &quot;&quot;kan sättas i munnen&quot; = &quot;sked&quot;&quot; (&quot;can be put in the mouth&quot; = &quot;spoon&quot;) can be grammatically changed; &quot;&quot;den kan sättas i munnen&quot; = &quot;skeden&quot;&quot; (&quot;it can be put in the mouth&quot; = &quot;the spoon&quot;), as the definite form of a noun includes declension.

=== Orthography ===

From their origin in New York, crosswords have spread to many countries and languages. In languages other than English, the status of diacritics varies according to the orthography of the particular language, thus:
* in Afrikaans all diacritical markings are ignored. Words such as &quot;TEË&quot; (meaning opposed) and &quot;TEE&quot; (meaning tea) are both simply written &quot;TEE&quot;. The same goes for &quot;SÊ&quot; (say) and &quot;SE&quot; (belonging to) and many others.
* in Czech and Slovak, diacritics are respected and &quot;ch&quot;, being considered one letter, occupies one square.
* in Dutch crosswords, the &quot;ij&quot; digraph is considered one letter, filling one square, and the &quot;IJ&quot; and the &quot;Y&quot; (see Dutch alphabet) are considered distinct. Rules may vary in other word games.
* in Esperanto crosswords, diacritics are respected, as they form separate letters (graphemes).
* in French, in Spanish and in Italian, accent marks and most other diacritical markings are ignored, except the tilde in Spanish: for instance, in French, the final &quot;E&quot; of answer &quot;ÊTRE&quot; can double as the final &quot;É&quot; of &quot;CONGÉ&quot; when written &quot;ETRE&quot; and &quot;CONGE&quot;; but in Spanish, N and Ñ are distinct letters.
* In Frisian diacritics are fully respected.
* in German language crosswords, the umlauts &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot;, and &quot;ü&quot; are dissolved into &quot;ae&quot;, &quot;oe&quot;, and &quot;ue&quot;, and &quot;ß&quot; is dissolved into &quot;ss&quot;.
* in Hungarian, diacritics are either fully respected, or not respected where they denote length: that is &quot;I/Í&quot;, &quot;O/Ó&quot;, &quot;Ö/Ő&quot;, &quot;U/Ú&quot;, &quot;Ü/Ű&quot; are considered the same, but not &quot;A/Á&quot; and &quot;E/É&quot; which mark different sounds; although the difference between the short/long pairs of letters is a distinctive feature in Hungarian. Digraphs fill two squares.
* in Irish crosswords, the accents on &quot;Á É Í Ó Ú&quot; are all respected, so (for example) the &quot;Í&quot; in &quot;SÍB&quot; cannot double as the &quot;I&quot; in &quot;SLIABH&quot;.
* in Latin, diacritics are ignored. Therefore, &quot;A&quot; is considered the same as &quot;Ă&quot; or &quot;Ā&quot;. Ecclesiastical Latin is normally used. See the monthly magazine of Latin crosswords &quot;Hebdomada Aenigmatum&quot; as a reference.
* in Portuguese, diacritics are ignored with the exception of &quot;Ç&quot;. Therefore, &quot;A&quot; could be checked with &quot;Ã&quot; or &quot;Á&quot;.
* in Romanian, diacritics are ignored.
* in Russian, &quot;Ё&quot; doubles as &quot;Е&quot; but &quot;Й&quot; is considered different from &quot;И&quot;; the soft sign &quot;Ь&quot; and the hard sign &quot;Ъ&quot; occupy a separate square, different from that of the previous letter.
* in Spanish crosswords, the digraphs &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;ll&quot; fill two squares, although in some old crosswords (from prior to the 1996 spelling reform) they filled one square.

=== Grid design, clues, and conventions ===
French-language crosswords are smaller than English-language ones, and not necessarily square: there are usually 8–13 rows and columns, totaling 81–130 squares. They need not be symmetric and two-letter words are allowed, unlike in most English-language puzzles. Compilers strive to minimize use of shaded squares. A black-square usage of 10% is typical; Georges Perec compiled many 9×9 grids for Le Point with four or even three black squares. Rather than numbering the individual clues, the rows and columns are numbered as on a chessboard. All clues for a given row or column are listed, against its number, as separate sentences.

In Italy, crosswords are usually oblong and larger than French ones, 13×21 being a common size. As in France, they usually are not symmetrical; two-letter words are allowed; and the number of shaded squares is minimized. Nouns (including surnames) and the infinitive or past participle of verbs are allowed, as are abbreviations; in larger crosswords, it is customary to put at the center of the grid phrases made of two to four words, or forenames and surnames. A variant of Italian crosswords does not use shaded squares: words are delimited by thickening the grid. Another variant starts with a blank grid: the solver must insert both the answers and the shaded squares, and across and down clues are either ordered by row and column or not ordered at all.

Modern Hebrew is normally written with only the consonants; vowels are either understood, or entered as diacritical marks. This can lead to ambiguities in the entry of some words, and compilers generally specify that answers are to be entered in ktiv male (with some vowels) or ktiv haser (without vowels). Further, since Hebrew is written from right to left, but Roman numerals are used and written from left to right, there can be an ambiguity in the description of lengths of entries, particularly for multi-word phrases. Different compilers and publications use differing conventions for both of these issues.

In the Japanese language crossword; because of the writing system, one syllable (typically katakana) is entered into each white cell of the grid rather than one letter, resulting in the typical solving grid seeming small in comparison to those of other languages. Any second Yōon character is treated as a full syllable and is rarely written with a smaller character. Even cipher crosswords have a Japanese equivalent, although pangrammaticity does not apply. Crosswords with kanji to fill in are also produced, but in far smaller number as it takes far more effort to construct one. Despite Japanese having three writing forms - hiragana, katakana, and kanji - they are rarely mixed in a single crossword puzzle. The design of Japanese crossword grids often follows two additional rules: that shaded cells may not share a side (i.e. they may not be orthogonally contiguous) and that the corner squares must be white.

A. N. Prahlada Rao, based in Bangalore, has composed/ constructed some 35,000 crossword puzzles in the language Kannada, including 7,500 crosswords based on films made in Kannada, with a total of 10,00,000 (ten lakhs, or one million) clues. His name was recorded in the Limca Book Of Records in 2015 for creating the highest number of crosswords in any Indian Regional Language. He continued to hold this title through 2016 and 2017. In 2008, a five volume set of his puzzles was released, followed by 7 more volumes in 2017. Bengali is also well known for its crossword puzzles. Crosswords are published regularly in most Bengali dailies and periodicals. The grid system is similar to the British style and two-letter words are usually not allowed.

In Poland, crosswords typically use British-style grids, but some do not have shaded cells. Shaded cells are often replaced by boxes with clues—such crosswords are called Swedish puzzles or Swedish-style crosswords. In a vast majority of Polish crosswords, nouns are the only allowed words.

Swedish crosswords are mainly in the illustrated (photos or drawings), in-line clue style typical of the &quot;Swedish-style grid&quot;. The &quot;Swedish-style&quot; grid (picture crosswords) uses no clue numbers. Instead, clues are contained in the cells which do not contain answers, with arrows indicating where and in what direction to fill in answers. Arrows can be omitted from clue cells, in which case the convention is for the answer to go horizontally to the right of the clue cell, or – if the clue cell is split vertically and contains two clues – for the answer to go horizontally to the right for the top clue and vertically below for the bottom clue. This style of grid is also used in several countries other than Sweden, often in magazines, but also in daily newspapers. The grid often has one or more photos replacing a block of squares as a clue to one or several answers; for example, the name of a pop star, or some kind of rhyme or phrase that can be associated with the photo. These puzzles usually have no symmetry in the grid but instead often have a common theme (literature, music, nature, geography, events of a special year, etc.) This tradition prospered already in the mid-1900s, in family magazines and sections of newspapers. Then the specialised magazines took off. Around the turn of the millennium, approximately half a dozen Swedish magazine publishers produced specialised crossword magazines, totaling more than twenty titles, often published on a monthly basis. The oldest extant crossword magazine published in Swedish is &quot;Krysset&quot; (from Bonnier), founded in 1957. Additionally, nearly all newspapers publish crosswords of some kind, and at weekends often devote specialised sections in the paper to crosswords and similar type of pastime material. Both major evening dailies (&quot;Aftonbladet&quot; and &quot;Expressen&quot;) publish a weekly crossword supplement, named &quot;Kryss &amp; Quiz&quot; and &quot;Korsord&quot; respectively. Both are available as paid supplements on Mondays and Tuesdays, as part of the ongoing competition between the two newspapers.

== Construction ==

=== American-style crosswords ===
In typical themed American-style crosswords, the theme is created first, as a set of symmetric long across answers will be needed around which the grid can be created. Since the grid will typically have 180-degree rotational symmetry, the answers will need to be also: thus a typical 15×15 square American puzzle might have two 15-letter entries and two 13-letter entries that could be arranged appropriately in the grid (e.g., one 15-letter entry in the third row, and the other symmetrically in the 13th row; one 13-letter entry starting in the first square of the 6th row and the other ending in the last square of the 10th row). The theme must not only be funny or interesting, but also internally consistent. In the April 26, 2005 by Sarah Keller mentioned above, the five themed entries contained in the different parts of a tree: SQUAREROOT, TABLELEAF, WARDROBETRUNK, BRAINSTEM, and BANKBRANCH. In this puzzle, CHARTER OAK would &quot;not&quot; be an appropriate entry, as all the other entries contain different parts of a tree, not the name of a kind of tree. Similarly, FAMILY TREE would not be appropriate unless it were used as a &quot;revealer&quot; for the theme (frequently clued with a phrase along the lines &quot;... and a hint to ...&quot;). Given the existing entries, SEED MONEY would also be unacceptable, as all the other theme entries &quot;end&quot; in the part of a tree as opposed to beginning with it, though the puzzle could certainly be changed to have a mix of words in different positions.

Once a consistent, appropriate theme has been chosen, a grid is designed around that theme, following a set of basic principles:
* Generally, most American puzzles are 15×15 squares; if another size, they typically have an odd number of rows and columns: e.g., 21×21 for &quot;Sunday-size&quot; puzzles; &quot;Games&quot; magazine will accept 17×17 puzzles, Simon &amp; Schuster accepts both 17×17 and 19×19 puzzles, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; requires diagramless puzzles to be 17×17. The odd number of squares on a side ensures that achieving symmetry is easier; with even-numbered puzzles the central block of four squares makes constructing a symmetrical puzzle considerably more difficult.
* The black squares must be arranged so as to (1) ensure there are no two-letter words; (2) form 180-degree rotational symmetry (so that if the grid is turned upside-down, the pattern of black squares remains the same); (3) ensure that every letter is checked (appears in both an across and a down word); (4) not occupy too much of the puzzle (generally speaking, 16% of the puzzle is considered a rough limit for the percentage of black squares); (5) ensure that the entire puzzle has &quot;all-over interlock&quot;—that is, that the black squares do not &quot;cut&quot; the puzzle into separate sections; and (6) ensure that (generally) no non-theme entry is longer than any of the theme entries. In addition, it is considered advisable to minimize the number of so-called &quot;cheater&quot; black squares, i.e., black squares whose removal would not change the word count of the puzzle but which make it easier to fill by shortening the length of the words therein.
* The grid is then filled with suitable words, keeping in mind that (1) no word can be repeated in the grid (with the exception of prepositions or articles); (2) profanity or graphic or &quot;unpleasant&quot; words are generally not allowed; (3) obscurity is strongly discouraged in easy puzzles and should be kept to a minimum in more difficult puzzles, where two obscure words should never be allowed to cross (known in crossword jargon as a &quot;Natick&quot;)(and, ideally, where the obscure word would be of interest to most solvers—a genus of little-known water bugs would not be a good choice); (4) uncommon abbreviations and variant foreign spellings should be avoided, as well as the use of crosswordese (those words that no longer appear in common speech but that occur frequently in crosswords due to their favorable letter combinations, such as the Asian buffalo &quot;ANOA&quot;); (5) in modern puzzles, pop figures and corporate and brand names are generally considered acceptable; (6) no made-up words are permitted—there should be a dictionary or other reference that can cite each entry if asked.
* Modern constructors frequently (although not always) use software to speed up the task. Several programs are available, of which the most widely accepted is Crossword Compiler. These programs, although they cannot create themes and cannot distinguish between &quot;good&quot; fill (fun, interesting words vs. dull obscurity), do speed up the process and will allow the constructor to realize if they have hit a dead end.

Crossword puzzle payments for standard 15×15 puzzles from the major outlets range from $50 (&quot;Games&quot;) to $500 (&quot;The New York Times&quot;) while payments for 21×21 puzzles range from $250 (&quot;Newsday&quot;) to $1,500 (&quot;The New York Times&quot;).

The compensation structure of crosswords generally entails authors selling all rights to their puzzles upon publication, and as a result receiving no royalties from republication of their work in books or other forms.

== Software ==

Software that aids in &quot;creating&quot; crossword puzzles has been written since at least 1976; one popular example was Crossword Magic for the Apple II in the 1980s. The earliest software relied on people to input a list of fill words and clues, and automatically maps the answers onto a suitable grid. This is a search problem in computer science because there are many possible arrangements to be checked against the rules of construction. Any given set of answers might have zero, one, or multiple legal arrangements. Modern open source libraries exist that attempt to efficiently generate legal arrangements from a given set of answers.

In the late 1990s, the transition began from mostly hand-created arrangements to computer-assisted, which creators generally say has allowed authors to produce more interesting and creative puzzles, reducing crosswordese.

Modern software includes large databases of clues and answers, allowing the computer to randomly select words for the puzzle, potentially with guidance from the user as to the theme or a specific set of words to pick with greater probability. Many serious users add words to the database as an expression of personal creativity or for use in a desired theme. Software can also be used to assist the user in finding words for a specific spot in an arrangement by quickly searching through the dictionary for all words that fit.

In 1998 in Jakarta, publisher Elex Media Komputindo (Gramedia Group) published a crossword software entitled &quot;Teka-Teki Silang Komputer&quot; (Computerized Crossword Puzzle [Eng]) in diskette form. It is the first Crossword Puzzle software published in Indonesia. Created by Sukmono Bayu Adhi, the software is archived in the National Library of the Republic of Indonesia (Salemba Library, Jakarta).

== Notation ==

Originally Petherbridge called the two dimensions of the crossword puzzle &quot;Horizontal&quot; and &quot;Vertical&quot;. Among various numbering schemes, the standard became that in which only the start squares of each word were numbered, from left to right and top to bottom. &quot;1 Horizontal&quot; and &quot;1 Vertical&quot; and the like were names for the clues, the cross words, or the grid locations, interchangeably.

Later in the &quot;Times&quot; these terms commonly became &quot;across&quot; and &quot;down&quot; and notations for clues could either use the words or the letters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, with or without hyphens.

<text>Herbert Bayer (April 5, 1900 – September 30, 1985) was an Austrian and American graphic designer, painter, photographer, sculptor, art director, environmental and interior designer, and architect. He was instrumental in the development of the Atlantic Richfield Company&#x27;s corporate art collection until his death in 1985.

==Biography==

===Training and Bauhaus years===

Bayer apprenticed under the artist Georg Schmidthammer in Linz. Leaving the workshop to study at the Darmstadt Artists&#x27; Colony, he became interested in Walter Gropius&#x27;s Bauhaus manifesto. After Bayer had studied for four years at the Bauhaus under such teachers as Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee and László Moholy-Nagy, Gropius appointed Bayer director of printing and advertising.

In the spirit of reductive minimalism, Bayer developed a crisp visual style and adopted use of all-lowercase, sans serif typefaces for most Bauhaus publications. Bayer is one of several typographers of the period including Kurt Schwitters and Jan Tschichold who experimented with the creation of a simplified more phonetic-based alphabet. From 1925 to 1930, Bayer designed a geometric sans-serif titled &quot;Proposal for a Universal Typeface&quot; (Herbert Bayer, universal) that existed only as a design and was never actually cast into real type. These designs are now issued in digital form as Bayer Universal (P22 Type Foundry Bauhaus Set). The design also inspired ITC Bauhaus and Architype Bayer, which bears comparison with the stylistically related typeface Architype Schwitters.

In 1923 Bayer met the photographer Irene Bayer-Hecht at the first large Bauhaus exhibit in Weimar. They married in 1925, separated in 1928, had a daughter, Julia Alexandra, in 1929, and divorced in 1944.

===Post-Bauhaus years in Germany===

In 1928, Bayer left the Bauhaus to become art director of Vogue magazine&#x27;s Berlin office. He remained in Germany far later than most other progressives. In 1936 he designed a brochure for the &quot;Deutschland Ausstellung&quot;, an exhibition for tourists in Berlin during the 1936 Olympic Gamesthe brochure celebrated life in Nazi Germany, and the authority of Hitler. However, in 1937, works of Bayer&#x27;s were included in the Nazi propaganda exhibition &quot;Degenerate Art&quot;, upon which he left Germany. Upon fleeing Germany, he traveled in Italy.

===Time in the United States===

In 1944 Bayer married Joella Synara Haweis, the daughter of poet and Dada artist Mina Loy. The same year, he became a U.S. citizen.

In 1946 the Bayers relocated. Hired by industrialist and visionary Walter Paepcke, Bayer moved to Aspen, Colorado as Paepcke promoted skiing as a popular sport. Bayer&#x27;s architectural work in the town included co-designing the Aspen Institute and restoring the Wheeler Opera House, but his production of promotional posters identified skiing with wit, excitement, and glamour.

In 1959, he designed his &quot;fonetik alfabet&quot;, a phonetic alphabet, for English. It was sans-serif and without capital letters. He had special symbols for the endings &quot;-ed&quot;, &quot;-ory&quot;, &quot;-ing&quot;, and &quot;-ion&quot;, as well as the digraphs &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, and &quot;ng&quot;. An underline indicated the doubling of a consonant in traditional orthography.

While living in Aspen, Bayer had a chance meeting with the eccentric oilman, outdoorsman and visionary ecologist, Robert O. Anderson. When Anderson saw the ultra-modern, Bauhaus-inspired home that Bayer had designed &amp; built in Aspen, he walked up to the front door and introduced himself. It was the beginning of a lifelong friendship between the two men and instigated Anderson&#x27;s insatiable passion for enthusiastically collecting contemporary art.

With Anderson&#x27;s eventual formation of the Atlantic Richfield Company, and as his personal art collection quickly overflowed out of his New Mexico ranch and other homes, ARCO soon held the unique distinction of possessing the world&#x27;s largest corporate art collection, under the critical eye and sharp direction of Bayer as ARCO&#x27;s Art and Design Consultant.

Overseeing acquisitions for ARCO Plaza, the newly built (1972) twin 51-story office towers in Los Angeles that served as the new company&#x27;s corporate headquarters, Bayer was also responsible for the ARCO logo and designing all corporate branding related to the company. Prior to the completion of ARCO Plaza, Anderson commissioned Bayer to design a monumental sculpture-fountain to be installed between the dark green granite towers. Originally titled &quot;Stairway to Nowhere&quot; Anderson laughed, but felt the Shareholders wouldn&#x27;t see the irony; thus he suggested it be named &quot;Double Ascension&quot; and it still stands between the twin skyscrapers today.

Under Bayer&#x27;s direction, ARCO&#x27;s art collection grew to nearly 30,000 works nationwide, managed by Atlantic Richfield Company Art Collection staff. ARCO&#x27;s collection was eclectic, and consisted of an extremely wide range of media &amp; styles; ranging from contemporary and earlier paintings, sculpture, works on paper (including drawings, watercolors and signed original lithographs, etchings and serigraphs) and signed photographs to tribal and ethnic art from many cultures, as well as historic prints and artifacts, all displayed throughout ARCO&#x27;s buildings in Los Angeles and several other cities. Three years after ARCO was taken over by BP in 2000, that company&#x27;s then-chairman, Lord Brown, personally ordered ARCO&#x27;s art collection liquidated. It was sold through Christie&#x27;s and LA Modern Auctions.
Bayer made provisions to donate, after his death, a collection of his works which had been housed in ARCO&#x27;s conference center in Santa Barbara to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The works have been loaned previously to the Denver Art Museum. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1979.

==Legacy and influence==
Bayer&#x27;s works appear in prominent public and private collections including the MIT List Visual Arts Center. Bayer designed the Mill Creek Canyon Earthworks, an environmental sculpture located in Kent, Washington.

In 2019, the philanthropists and entrepreneurs Lynda and Stewart Resnick donated $10 million to the nonprofit Aspen Institute for a center dedicated to Bayer that will be located on the Institute&#x27;s Aspen Meadows campus, which Bayer designed. The facility, the Resnick Center for Herbert Bayer Studies, is to have galleries, educational programs, and an overall aim to provide tools for the preservation and study of Bayer&#x27;s work.

Herbert Bayer was the architect for the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, in Fort Worth, Texas. The institution moved to its new location designed by architect Tadao Ando in 2002. The building, owned by the City of Fort Worth, is now the Fort Worth Community Arts Center, which features seven galleries highlighting regional and national artists.

<text>Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft (; &quot;German-American Friendship&quot;), or D.A.F., was a German electropunk/Neue Deutsche Welle band from Düsseldorf, formed in 1978 featuring Gabriel &quot;Gabi&quot; Delgado-López (vocals), Robert Görl (drums, percussion, electronic instruments), Kurt &quot;Pyrolator&quot; Dahlke (electronic instruments), Michael Kemner (bass-guitar) and Wolfgang Spelmans (guitar). Kurt Dahlke was replaced by Chrislo Haas (electronic instruments, bass guitar, saxophone) in 1979. Since 1981, the band has consisted of Delgado-López and Görl. Gabi Delgado-Lopez died on 22 March 2020 aged 61.

In interviews they claimed not to target anything or anyone specific while writing lyrics to be taken as a parody of words and phrases floating around in the public media. &quot;Sato-Sato&quot; and &quot;Der Mussolini&quot; are both examples of songs written around Delgado-López&#x27;s fascination with the sound of a particular word. A few months before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, D.A.F. released &quot;The Sheriff (An Anti-American Song)&quot;.

The album &quot;Alles ist gut&quot; (all is good) received the German &quot;Schallplattenpreis&quot; award by the &quot;Deutsche Phono-Akademie&quot; (The German Phono-Academy), an association of the German recording industry.

==History==
===Formation and early albums===
Görl came to Düsseldorf in August 1978 and met Delgado as both were regulars at punk club Ratinger Hof. Görl noted, &quot;The earliest line up of DAF was Gabi and me in the basement of the Ratinger Hof. We created our basic ideas and we had a very strong will as a duo. Gabi Delgado played the stylophone and I played the drums.&quot; Several early Neue Deutsche Welle bands formed from this social group, and Görl and Delgado played with multiple other bands. The first two D.A.F. albums featured the original four-piece line-up and a range of styles. Their first album, &quot;Ein Produkt der Deutsch-Amerikanischen Freundschaft&quot;, was released in 1979 on Dahlke&#x27;s Ata Tak label (then called Warning). The album was 22 improvised untitled instrumentals, Delgado having temporarily left the band at the time.

The band then moved to London. As Delgado later noted, &quot;at that time if you wanted to do new music you’d go to London because that was the center, not Düsseldorf.&quot; Daniel Miller signed DAF to Mute Records because &quot;they weren’t relying on past rock traditions at all, which is the criterion of what goes on Mute.&quot; DAF recorded &quot;Die Kleinen und die Bösen&quot; (The Small Ones and the Evil Ones) for Mute, one side studio and most of the other side live. According to the Trouser Press, &quot;Ein Produkt...&quot; featured &quot;shrieking, colliding overdubbed synths and guitars&quot; while &quot;Die Kleinen...&quot; presented a more polished sound &quot;with anarchic synthesizer work slowly integrating a solid, defined beat.&quot;

===Virgin trilogy===
DAF then shrank to just Delgado and Görl, who signed to Virgin Records and released &quot;Alles ist gut&quot;, their breakthrough album. The band became pop stars in Germany and gained great critical acclaim in the UK.

Görl played drums — usually fairly simple and relatively unsyncopated patterns, but with simple variations that prevented them sounding robotic — while Delgado sang. The only other instruments used were Korg MS-20 and ARP Odyssey analogue synthesizers usually driven by a Korg SQ-10 analog sequencer. Typically only a single sequencer-driven line would be used for a song, the sequence functioning both as melodic accompaniment and as a bassline. The song &quot;Der Mussolini&quot; is a perfect example of this. On other songs, such as the title track, certain notes of the sequence were set slightly out of tune. Overall the songs entail a complex tension between the predominantly visceral (the voice), the relentlessly robotic (the 16-step sequences), and the drums, which lie somewhere in between. One song, Der Räuber und der Prinz (The Robber and the Prince), also features a Glockenspiel-like sound as a sinister reminder of childhood.

&quot;Alles ist gut&quot; sold hundreds of thousands in Germany, and DAF became the fifth-biggest German-speaking group in Germany.

The next two albums, &quot;Gold und Liebe&quot; (Gold and Love) and &quot;Für Immer&quot; (Forever), continued in the same vein, until, as one British music journalist of the time put it, D.A.F. had exhausted all the possibilities of the 16-step sequencer. These possibilities ranged from something resembling rhythm and blues — you could just about play Der Mussolini as R&#x27;n&#x27;B if you wanted — to the microtonality of &quot;Im Dschungel der Liebe&quot; (In the Jungle of Love) (on &quot;Für immer&quot;) or &quot;Knochen auf Knochen&quot; (the B-side of the single &quot;Sex unter Wasser&quot;). These three albums (from &quot;Alles ist gut&quot; to &quot;Für immer&quot;) were all produced by Konrad &quot;Conny&quot; Plank, who was renowned for his pioneering work both with minimalist-influenced Krautrock bands and other experimenters in the 1970s, and with electropop artists in the 1980s. The band added an Oberheim OB-Xa for &quot;Für immer&quot;.

The band split during the recording of &quot;Für immer&quot;.

===Post-split===
Each member released solo albums: Delgado &quot;Mistress&quot; (on Virgin), and Görl &quot;Night Full Of Tension&quot; (on Mute).

Delgado and Görl reunited in 1985 to record &quot;1st Step to Heaven&quot;, their only album in English, which achieved one week in the Swedish album chart at no. 46. Delgado later noted: &quot;So we wanted to break our own rules and said: OK, so now we sing in English, now we don’t wear black. &quot;(laughing)&quot; With purpose. Because we wanted to break our own rules.&quot;

During this extensive period their historical importance began to become clearer. Legendary radio DJ John Peel went as far as to call them the &quot;Grandfathers of Techno&quot;. Both Robert and Gabi had solo musical careers, with Robert becoming a respected techno artist in his own right. Gabi Delgado also recorded two albums as DAF/DOS (&#x27;Dos&#x27; here referring to the Spanish word for &#x27;two&#x27;) together with Wotan Wilke.
When DAF reformed for the 2003 album &quot;Fünfzehn neue D.A.F.-Lieder&quot; (15 New D.A.F Songs) their style had shifted to a fusion of the classic Plank-produced D.A.F. sound with elements taken from Robert&#x27;s techno work. The drums were replaced with crisper electronic beats, but the ARP Avatar and, of course, Gabi&#x27;s vocals remained in place. According to Deutsche Welle, the album &quot;takes specific aim at American cultural imperialism and political dominance&quot; as evidenced by the first single, &quot;Der Sheriff&quot;, a song about the George W. Bush administration. &quot;Der Sheriff&quot; peaked at #2 on the German Alternative Charts (DAC) and ranked #15 on the DAC Top 100 Singles of 2003.

The band prepared more music, but split before they could make another album. Görl played in 2007 as DAF.Partei with Thoralf Dietrich (from Jäger 90) as lead singer.

Delgado-Lopez and Görl have played occasional reunion shows since their thirtieth anniversary tour in 2008. In 2010, the band returned with a new single &quot;Du bist DAF&quot;, limited to 2010 copies. The sound snippet is available via SoundCloud.

The band declared its split again in January 2015, with another farewell tour to start in May.

An authorised biography of the band, &quot;Das ist DAF&quot;, written by Miriam Spies and Rudi Esch, was published in 2017. There is no English translation of the text available at present. According to the publisher&#x27;s page, &quot;This richly illustrated book tells the unique DAF story from the perspective of Gabi Delgado and Robert Görl&quot;, both of whom as DAF are &quot;regarded as a forerunner of the techno and EBM scene.&quot;

Delgado died in 2020. Görl released one last album as DAF, &quot;Nur Noch Einer&quot; in 2021, based on old DAF tapes and with new lyrics by Görl.

===Legacy===
The D.A.F. track &quot;Alle Gegen Alle&quot; was remade by Laibach in 1994. &quot;Der Mussolini&quot; was remade by Atrocity in 1997 and by KMFDM in 2006. Patrik Sampler&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;The Ocean Container&quot; makes reference to &quot;Greif Nach Den Sternen&quot;.

==Style==
Görl described their sound on &quot;Alles ist gut&quot; in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1981:

:Most bands get a synthesizer and their first idea is to tune it! They want a clean normal sound. They don’t work with the &quot;power&quot; you get from a synthesizer ... We want to bring together this high technique with body power so you have the past time mixed with the future.

Delgado described his new vocal style in the same interview:

:The singing isn’t like rock ’n’ roll or pop singing. It’s sometimes like in a Hitler speech, not a Nazi thing, but it’s in the German character, that &quot;crack! crack! crack!&quot; way of speaking.

The band determined early on that they would not sing in English. As Delgado later said:

:It’s not only a part of image. It’s a serious matter because DAF from the very first beginning didn’t want to imitate any American pop, rock or whatever. In fact we think there is a very strong American influence in culture, television, music, everywhere. So in the very first beginning one of our main content was to refuse to imitate rock ‘n’ roll, to refuse to sing in English. We don’t do that. We have our own identity. Our identity is not American identity.

As a lyricist, Delgado&#x27;s concerns throughout D.A.F.&#x27;s recording career have ranged from sardonic reflections on ideology and political violence, to journeys into a very physical, even brutal, sexuality, sometimes related from a child&#x27;s point of view. Having grown up as the child of working class Spanish immigrants in Wuppertal, and coming of age in the politically polarized era of the German Autumn (his response to the left-wing extremism of that time being thematized in the 2003 song &quot;Kinderzimmer (Heldenlied)&quot; [&quot;Childhood Bedroom (Hero Song)&quot;], he was blunt and unromantically detached about social reality in West Germany, and unapologetic about the provocative potential of his songs.

As performers and media personalities D.A.F. were, much like New York&#x27;s Suicide, forerunners of later 1980s synthpop duos, such as the Pet Shop Boys and Soft Cell, in that the singer (in this case Delgado) appears relatively extroverted while the one who plays with the electronics (Görl) appears quiet and reserved. Visually, at least from &quot;Alles ist gut&quot; until &quot;1st Step to Heaven&quot;, they cultivated an image of black leather, muscles, hairy chests, and sweat.

<doc id="69769" wikidata="Q23143" url="?curid=69769" title="Bedfordshire">
<text>Bedfordshire (; abbreviated &quot;Beds&quot;) is a ceremonial county in the East of England. It is bordered by Northamptonshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Hertfordshire to the south and the south-east, and Buckinghamshire to the west. The largest settlement is Luton (225,262), and Bedford is the county town.

The county has an area of and had a population of 704,736 at the 2021 census. Its other towns include Leighton Buzzard, Dunstable, Biggleswade, Houghton Regis, and Flitwick. Much of the county is rural. For local government purposes, Bedfordshire comprises three unitary authority areas: Bedford, Central Bedfordshire, and Luton.

The county&#x27;s highest point is on Dunstable Downs in the Chilterns.

==History==
The first recorded use of the name in 1011 was &quot;Bedanfordscir&quot;, meaning the shire or county of Bedford, which itself means &quot;Beda&#x27;s ford&quot; (river crossing).

Bedfordshire was historically divided into nine hundreds: Barford, Biggleswade, Clifton, Flitt, Manshead, Redbornestoke, Stodden, Willey, Wixamtree, along with the liberty and the ancient borough of Bedford.

There have been several changes to the county boundary; for example, in 1897 Kensworth and part of Caddington were transferred from Hertfordshire to Bedfordshire. 

==Geography==

The southern end of the county is on the chalk ridge known as the Chiltern Hills. The remainder forms part of the broad drainage basin of the River Great Ouse and its tributaries. Most of Bedfordshire&#x27;s rocks are clays and sandstones from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, with some limestone. Local clay has been used for brick-making of Fletton-style bricks in the Marston Vale. Glacial erosion of chalk has left hard flint nodules deposited as gravel—these have been commercially extracted in the past at pits which are now lakes: at Priory Country Park, Wyboston and Felmersham. The Greensand Ridge is an escarpment across the county from near Leighton Buzzard to near Gamlingay in Cambridgeshire.

===Climate===
Bedfordshire, being situated in the east of England, has a relatively dry climate for the UK with regular but generally moderate rainfall. Average annual rainfall is at Bedford. October is the wettest month, with , and March the driest, with .

Although temperatures are usually moderate, the county has one of the largest absolute temperature ranges in the UK – of more than 60 °C (108 °F). Average temperatures in Bedford range from a low of overnight in February to a high of during the day in July. The highest official temperature recorded in Bedfordshire was in 2022. The lowest official temperature recorded in Bedfordshire was in 1947.

==Politics==

===Police and Crime Commissioner===

The Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner is John Tizard, a member of the Labour Party.

===Local government===

For local government purposes, Bedfordshire is divided into three unitary authorities: the boroughs of Bedford and Luton, and the district of Central Bedfordshire. Healthcare in the county is dealt with by a single Clinical Commission Group (CCG), which serves all three local authorities in the county, alongside the City of Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire.

===Emergency services===

Policing and fire and rescue services continue to be provided on a county-wide basis, with Bedfordshire Police governed by the Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner and Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service governed by a Fire Authority comprising members of the three councils.

===Parliamentary constituencies===

For elections to the House of Commons, Bedfordshire is divided into seven constituencies, each returning a single Member of Parliament (MP):

The present constituencies date from 1997. The boundaries were slightly modified for the 2010 general election.

==Economy==
This is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of Bedfordshire at current basic prices published (pp. 240–253) by &quot;Office for National Statistics&quot; with figures in millions of British Pounds Sterling.
Bedfordshire is the location of a number of notable UK and international companies who have either headquarters or major bases in the county. Autoglass, Boxclever and Charles Wells Pubs are all based in Bedford, while the Kier Group and Kingspan Timber Solutions are based in Sandy, and Jordans Cereals are based in Biggleswade. EasyJet, Impellam, TUI Airways and Vauxhall Motors are all based in Luton, Whitbread is based in Houghton Regis and Costa Coffee is now based in Dunstable. UltraVision is based in Leighton Buzzard, while Moto Hospitality is based at Toddington service station.

==Traditional dishes==
The &quot;Bedfordshire clanger&quot; is a local dish consisting of a suet crust pastry filled with meat in one end and a fruit preserve in the other. It was traditionally a farm labourers&#x27; meal, designed so as to produce no waste as well as two separate meals.

Chocolate Toothpaste is another local delicacy. A chocolate tart, Chocolate Toothpaste consists of a gritty chocolate filling (said to resemble the texture of toothpaste) within a pastry tart, commonly finished with a swirl of whipped cream on top.

==Visitor attractions==


==Transport==

Bedfordshire lies on many of the main transport routes which link London to the Midlands, Northern England and the rest of the UK.

===Roads===
Two of England&#x27;s six main trunk roads pass through Bedfordshire. The A1 London to Edinburgh road (the Great North Road) runs close by Biggleswade and Sandy, and Watling Street, the Roman road between London and Chester, passes through Dunstable. Until it was diverted in 2017, this was also the route of the A5 road between London and Holyhead. The Bedfordshire section of the A5 now runs from junction 11a of the M1 to rejoin Watling Street between Dunstable and Hockliffe, then continues on to cross the Buckinghamshire border at the City of Milton Keynes.

To these was added in 1959 the M1 motorway, running from London to Leeds. Running from junctions 10 to 13 in Bedfordshire, there are two junctions serving Luton (at the southern end), with another one serving Bedford and Milton Keynes (at the northern end). Between these lies two other junctions in the county, with one connecting to the A5 and serving Dunstable, and the other serving the town of Flitwick. There is also one motorway service station in the county: Toddington Services.

Former trunk roads, now local roads managed by the local highway authorities, include the A428 (Cambridge-Coventry) running east–west through Bedford Borough, and the A6 from Luton to Carlisle.

===Railways===
Three of England&#x27;s main lines pass through Bedfordshire.

The West Coast Main Line has but a short section where it passes through the far west of the county, with one station at served by West Midlands Trains to London Euston and .

The East Coast Main Line has stations at , and , served by Great Northern services to King&#x27;s Cross and .

The Midland Main Line serves , Luton Airport (via Luton DART link from the station at ) and , with trains to many destinations operated by East Midlands Railway and Thameslink. Intermediate stations at , and are served by Thameslink.

There are London North Western rural services also running between Bedford and along the Marston Vale Line.

===Waterways===
The River Great Ouse links Bedfordshire to the Fenland waterways. As of 2004 there are plans by the Bedford &amp; Milton Keynes Waterway Trust to construct a canal linking the Great Ouse at Bedford to the Grand Union Canal at Milton Keynes, 14 miles (23 km) distant.

===Air===

Luton Airport (the fifth busiest in the United Kingdom) has flights to many UK, European, Middle Eastern and North African destinations, operated largely (but not exclusively) by low-cost airlines.

==Media==
Local news is provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia from Cambridge, the southern part of the county such as Luton can also receive BBC London &amp; ITV London meaning the area can get news and television programmes from Cambridge and London.

Local radio stations are BBC Three Counties Radio (broadcast from Dunstable), Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio Bucks, Beds and Herts (formerly Mix 96), BigglesFM (covering Biggleswade, Potton and Sandy), In2beats (Bedford) and Radio LaB (Luton).

The state education system for all of Bedfordshire used to be organised by Bedfordshire County Council. Unlike most of the United Kingdom, Bedfordshire County Council operated a three-tier education system arranged into lower, middle and upper schools, as recommended in the Plowden Report of 1967, although Luton continued to operate a two-tier system. The three-tier arrangement continued in the rest of the county, though in 2006 a vote was held with a view to moving to the two-tier model, but this was rejected.

After the 2009 structural changes to local government in England, Bedfordshire County Council was abolished, and its responsibilities for education were passed to Bedford Borough Council and Central Bedfordshire Council.

===Bedford Borough===
Bedford Borough Council voted in November 2009 to change to the two-tier model in its area. The change was due to be introduced over a five-year period and be completed in 2015. However, with the cancellation of the Building Schools for the Future programme in 2010, the borough changed its proposals, and the switch proceeded on school by school basis where council funds allowed. However as of 2020 all of Bedford Borough has a two-tier education structure apart from in the Marston Vale area (one upper school remains).

Most of the secondary schools in the area offer sixth form courses (such as A Levels), though Bedford College and The Bedford Sixth Form also offer a range of further education courses. Additionally, Stella Mann College is a private college which offers a range of further education courses relating to the performing arts.

There are a number of independent schools, many of which have links to the Harpur Trust. These include Bedford School, Bedford Modern School and Bedford Girls&#x27; School.

===Central Bedfordshire===

In Central Bedfordshire, the school systems in Dunstable and Sandy have been re-organised into the two-tier model in response to parent and school demand, but elsewhere in the authority the three-tier model continues. Plans for the construction of new settlements in Marston Vale have included lower, middle and upper schools.

As well as sixth form departments in schools, the main further education providers in the district are Central Bedfordshire College and Shuttleworth College

===Luton===
Luton also operates a three-tier education system, though its organisation of infant, junior and high schools mirrors the traditional transfer age into secondary education of 11 years. However, most of Luton&#x27;s high schools do not offer sixth-form education. Instead, this is handled by Luton Sixth Form College, though Barnfield College and Cardinal Newman Catholic School, Stockwood Park Academy and The Chalk Hills Academy also offer a range of further education courses.

===Higher education===
There are two universities based in the county – the University of Bedfordshire and Cranfield University. These institutions attract students from all over the UK and abroad, as well as from Bedfordshire.

==Landmarks==
=== Cardington airship sheds ===
The enormous Cardington airship sheds are situated to the south of Bedford, near the villages of Cardington and Shortstown. They were originally built for the construction of large airships during World War I. Since falling out of their intended use, one has been used for many purposes including housing film sets for &#x27;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#x27; and &#x27;Batman Begins&#x27; and as a rehearsal space for Take That, with the other having been extensively refurbished and now accommodating Hybrid Air Vehicles, a British modern airship design and manufacturing company.

=== St Paul&#x27;s Church Bedford ===
St Paul&#x27;s Church, Bedford is a Church of England parish church and the Civic Church of the Borough of Bedford and the County of Bedfordshire. Located on St Paul&#x27;s Square, it is a large medieval and later church of cathedral proportions and spire. St Paul&#x27;s was the church of the BBC during the Second World War.

=== Millbrook Proving Ground ===
The Millbrook Proving Ground, near Junction 13 of the M1, has of varied vehicle test tracks.

==Sport and leisure==
Bedfordshire is home to Championship team Luton Town F.C. and the Ampthill RUFC and Bedford Blues rugby teams, amongst other various sporting teams.

Bedfordshire boasts a 40-mile (64  km) walk traversing the county from Leighton Buzzard at the southern endpoint and Sandy, Bedfordshire/Gamlingay in southern Cambridgeshire to the east; this is called the Greensand Ridge Walk. For cyclists, there is a parallel route called the Greensand Cycle Way that follows minor country roads.

<text>Bedford is a market town in Bedfordshire, England. At the 2011 Census, the population of its urban area (as defined by the Office for National Statistics), including Kempston and Biddenham, was 106,940. Bedford is the county town of Bedfordshire and seat of the Borough of Bedford local government district.

Bedford was founded at a ford on the River Great Ouse and is thought to have been the burial place of King Offa of Mercia, who is remembered for building Offa&#x27;s Dyke on the Welsh border. Bedford Castle was built by Henry I, although it was destroyed in 1224. Bedford was granted borough status in 1166 and has been represented in Parliament since 1265. It is known for its large population of Italian descent.

==History==

The name of the town is believed to derive from the name of a Saxon chief called Beda, and a ford crossing the River Great Ouse. Bedford was a market town for the surrounding agricultural region from the early Middle Ages. The Anglo-Saxon King Offa of Mercia was buried in the town in 796; this is believed to be in his new minster, now the Church of St Paul, or on the banks of the Great Ouse where his tomb was soon lost to the river. In 886 it became a boundary town separating Wessex and Danelaw. It was the seat of the Barony of Bedford. In 919 Edward the Elder built the town&#x27;s first known fortress, on the south side of the River Great Ouse and there received the area&#x27;s submission. This fortress was destroyed by the Danes. William II gave the barony of Bedford to Paine de Beauchamp, who built a new, strong castle.

Bedford traces its borough charter in 1166 by Henry II and elected two members to the unreformed House of Commons. The new Bedford Castle was razed in 1224 and today only a mound remains. From the 16th century Bedford and much of Bedfordshire became one of the main centres of England&#x27;s lace industry, and lace continued to be an important industry in Bedford until the early 20th century. In 1660 John Bunyan was imprisoned for 12 years in Bedford Gaol. It was here that he wrote &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. The River Great Ouse became navigable as far as Bedford in 1689. Wool declined in importance with brewing becoming a major industry in the town. The 19th century saw Bedford transform into an important engineering hub. The northern part of the town was badly damaged in the Great Fire of Bedford in 1802, which destroyed 72 properties in the St Loyes area. 21 years later, the Great Flood of Bedford swamped most of the town when the River Great Ouse burst its banks. The former Phoenix public house in St Johns Street has a stone marker in its wall almost two metres above ground level, representing the maximum height of the floodwater in 1823. In 1832 gas lighting was introduced, and the railway reached Bedford in 1846. The first corn exchange was built 1849, and the first drains and sewers were dug in 1864.

Bedford&#x27;s first woman town councillor was Mary Milligan who, in 1919, was also the secretary of the local Women&#x27;s Citizens League.

==Governance==

The contiguous Bedford built-up area forms the largest settlement in the wider Borough of Bedford. The borough council is led by a directly elected mayor who holds the title &#x27;Mayor of Bedford&#x27;, an office which was first held by Frank Branston, until his death in 2009. The current mayor of Bedford is Tom Wootton from the Conservative Party.

The Bedford built-up area is divided into 10 wards for elections to the Borough Council: Brickhill, Castle, Cauldwell, De Parys, Goldington, Harpur, Kingsbrook, Newnham, Putnoe, Queens Park, Kempston East and Kempston West. Within the Bedford urban area, only Brickhill, Biddenham and Kempston elect their own parish councils, while the rest (and majority) of the built-up area is unparished. Kempston is the only civil parish in both the built-up area and Borough of Bedford which has a town council.

Bedford is served by Bedfordshire Police The Chief Constable since January 2023 is Trevor Rodenhurst. The elected Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner of that force is John Tizard.

Bedford forms part of the Bedford constituency, represented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Parliament. The current Member of Parliament (MP) for Bedford is Mohammad Yasin, who is a member of the Labour Party.

==Geography==
Bedford is miles north-northwest of London, southeast of Birmingham, west of Cambridge and east-southeast of Northampton.
The town of Kempston is part of Bedford&#x27;s built-up area, as is the village of Biddenham. Other villages adjacent to, but outside of, the built-up area include Bromham, Elstow, Renhold and Ravensden. Wixams is a new town which is being developed to the south of Bedford. Villages in the Borough of Bedford, outside of the built-up area, with populations of more than 2,000 (as of 2005) include Clapham, Elstow, Oakley, Sharnbrook, Shortstown, Wilstead, and Wootton. There are also many smaller villages in the borough.
==Climate==
As with the rest of the United Kingdom, Bedford has a maritime climate, with a limited range of temperatures, and generally even rainfall throughout the year. The nearest Met Office weather station to Bedford is Bedford (Thurleigh) airport, about north of Bedford town centre at an elevation of . Temperature extremes at the site have ranged from in July 2022, down to in January 1982. However, such extremes would likely be superseded if longer-term records were available – Historically, the nearest weather station to Bedford was Cardington about south south east of the town centre with an elevation of . This location recorded a minimum of during January 1963.

Rainfall averages around a year, with an excess of falling on 109 days.

Sunshine at around 1,500 hours a year is typical of inland areas of southern-central England.

==Demography==

Bedford is home to one of the largest concentrations of Italian immigrants in the United Kingdom. According to the 2001 census, almost 30% of Bedford&#x27;s population were of at least partial Italian descent. This is mainly as a result of labour recruitment in the early 1950s by the London Brick Company from Southern Italy. From 1954 to 2008 Bedford had its own Italian vice-consulate.

In addition to Italian immigrants, Bedford has also been the recipient of significant immigration from India (8.1% of Bedford&#x27;s population; Indians began arriving from the late 1950s onwards from the Punjab area &amp; many worked at the London Brick Company), Eastern Europe (particularly in the 2000s) and Scandinavia, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Greece, Cyprus, Northern Cyprus, Malta, Spain, France, Switzerland, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Albania, Turkey, The Middle East, East Asia, South East Asia, Africa (3% of Bedford&#x27;s population is of Sub-Saharan descent), South America and the Caribbean, making it one of the most ethnically, racially, and linguistically diverse towns in the United Kingdom outside of London in proportion to its size.

At the 2011 Census, the ethnic mix of the Bedford urban area was 74.4% white, 4% mixed, 15% Asian/Asian British, 5% Black/African/Caribbean/Black British, and 1% &quot;other ethnic group&quot;. In terms of national identity, just over 50% identified as English only, 24% as British only and 15% only as a non-UK identity; just over 8% had a &quot;British and other&quot; identity.

In 2001, Bedford was 69% Christian, 24% Irreligious, 3% Muslim, and 2% Sikh. By 2021, Bedford was 48% Christian, 40% Irreligious, 7% Muslim, and 2% Sikh.

==Landmarks==

Bedford Park is the town&#x27;s largest urban park and is located directly to the north of the town centre. The park retains many original features from its Victorian design and construction, including a cricket pavilion and bandstand which are both still in use. Priory Country Park is a large country park located on the northern bank of the River Great Ouse in eastern Bedford. Both parks have been awarded Green Flag status.

Bedford&#x27;s principal church is St Paul&#x27;s, in the square of the same name at the historic centre of the town. It is the Civic Church of the Borough of Bedford and County of Bedfordshire and has a tall, iconic spire which is one of the dominant features of the town. There was an early Minster church on the site by 1066 and work on the present structure began in the early 13th century, but little remains from that period. John Bunyan and John Wesley both preached in the church. In 1865–1868 the tower and spire were completely rebuilt and the two transepts added and lesser alterations have been made since. From 1941 to the end of the Second World War the BBC&#x27;s daily service was broadcast from St Paul&#x27;s. Another notable local church is St Peter&#x27;s, on St Peter&#x27;s Street, which contains some of the oldest architectural remains in Bedford, the most ancient being the two monoliths. St Paul&#x27;s Church also hosts the town&#x27;s Visitor Information Centre.

Just outside the town lie the Cardington airship hangars. The hangars have been used to shoot scenes for movies such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, and &quot;Inception&quot;. The hangars can be seen from the Bedford Bypass.

Despite being far upriver from the sea, seals have occasionally been reported as swimming as far inland as Bedford.

The Old Town Hall dates back to 1550 and the building was originally constructed as a school.


===River Great Ouse===

The River Great Ouse passes through the town centre and is lined with gardens known as the Embankment. Within these gardens, opposite Rothsay Road, stands a war memorial to the men of the town killed in the First World War. The memorial was designed in 1921 by the sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger and depicts the Anglo Saxon Lady Athelflaed, who ruled Mercia, killing a dragon. The inscription reads

===Bedford Castle===
Bedford Castle Mound is the remnant of Bedford&#x27;s medieval castle, located close to the centre of the modern town, less than a hundred yards from Bedford Bridge and the High Street. In around 2000, Bedford Borough Council built a sloping retaining wall on the south side, facing the river. Although almost completely modern, the wall does incorporate a few pieces of historic masonry. A paved path leads round the side of the mound up to the top, which is a flat circular grassy area. A small wooden structure of the same date at the top of the wall, much like a bus shelter, protects tourists from the rain while they view the river embankment.

==Transport==
===Railway===
There are two stations in Bedford. The main Bedford railway station is on the Midland Main Line, providing inter-city services to London St Pancras and the East Midlands, operated by East Midlands Railway. Stopping services, operated by Thameslink, run through London to Gatwick Airport and Brighton. Bedford&#x27;s other lesser used station is Bedford St John&#x27;s which in on the Marston Vale Line. Services are operated by London North Western Railway and run between Bletchley and Bedford&#x27;s main station.

===Road===
Road access to and from the town is provided by the A6 and A421 roads; the former connects the town with Kettering to the north-west, and Luton to the south, whilst the latter connects the town with Milton Keynes and the M1 (at Junction 13) to the west, and the A1 to the east (near St Neots) via a bypass, with both being around away. Other roads that serve or skirt the town include the A422, which runs westwards into Milton Keynes (also connecting to the M1 at Junction 14 via the A509), and the A428, which runs between Coventry and Cambridge.

The new Greyfriars surface car park and the refurbished Allhallows multi-storey car park both implement a pay on foot system. Greyfriars occupies 142 parking spaces, including 7 designated disabled spaces, although there is a 2-hour per day parking limit.

===Buses===
Bedford bus station serves the town and was reopened on 29 March 2015, after undergoing £8.8million regeneration which began in 2013. 
The main operators in and around the town are Stagecoach East and Stagecoach Midlands.

==Education==

Bedford Borough previously operated a three-tier education system, which was arranged into lower, middle and upper schools, as recommended in the Plowden Report of 1967. The arrangement was put to the vote in 2006 with a view to moving to the two-tier model, but was rejected. On 17 November 2009, borough councillors voted 19 to 17 in favour of a two tier system, which would then be phased in. However, following the defeat of the Labour Government in 2010, the new coalition government announced that the funding necessary for the switch to a two-tier system would no longer be available. As a result, the switch proceeded on a school by school basis as national funding was due to cover most of the cost. However, in July 2015, the council announced the intention to support the transition to a system of two tier education across the whole borough in a coordinated way. At the time, only the Wootton cluster of schools chose not to transition. As of September 2018, all of the borough&#x27;s schools have converted to two-tier. The secondary schools currently operating in the borough are Bedford Academy, Bedford Free School, Biddenham International School, Castle Newnham School, Goldington Academy, Mark Rutherford School and St Thomas More Catholic School.

Bedford is home to four private schools run by the Harpur Trust charity, endowed by Bedfordian Sir William Harpur in the 16th century. These are:
* Bedford School for boys aged 7–18
* Bedford Modern School, a former boys&#x27; school which became co-educational in 2003 for pupils aged 7–18
* Bedford Girls&#x27; School for girls aged 7–18. (Merged September 2012 – Formerly Bedford High School for Girls and Dame Alice Harpur School)
* Pilgrims Pre-Preparatory School

Smaller private institutions include Bedford Greenacre Independent School (boys and girls aged 3–18), and Polam School (boys and girls aged 12 months to 9 years), neither of which are part of the Harpur Trust.

Bedford hosts a campus of the University of Bedfordshire, which prior to a merger with the University of Luton in 2006 had been a campus of De Montfort University (itself now solely based in Leicester). For further education, the town is served by Bedford College and The Bedford Sixth Form. Additionally, Stella Mann College is a private college, which offers a range of further education courses relating to the performing arts.

==Religious sites==

The town has a high number of places of worship, including the Civic and County Church of St Paul&#x27;s and the Church of St Peter&#x27;s. There are three from the Newfrontiers network, as well as Polish, Arab, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian Roman Catholic churches, LDS (Mormon) meeting houses, Greek, Russian and other Orthodox churches, Presbyterian churches, Lutheran churches, Baptist churches, Evangelical churches, Methodist churches, Protestant churches, Anglican churches and various independent churches and other places of worship that cater to the different ethnic, racial, and language groups. There are four Islamic mosques in the town. There are also Buddhist and Hindu temples in the town.

Bedford has the largest Sikh gurdwara in the United Kingdom outside London, alongside two other Sikh gurdwaras; one of which is in Kempston. Bedford has Guru Ravidass and Valmiki temples.

There are Quaker, Jehovah&#x27;s Witness and Wiccan communities who meet and have their own places of worship in the town. There is no longer a synagogue in Bedford, but Bedfordshire Progressive Synagogue, based in Luton, meets in Bedford once a month for the town&#x27;s Jewish community. The nearest Orthodox synagogue is the Luton United Synagogue, a Lubavitch synagogue in Luton. Bedford is the former headquarters of the Panacea Society, founded in 1919, who believed that the town would have an important role in the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, and that Bedford was the original location of the Garden of Eden.
==Culture==

The Higgins Art Gallery &amp; Museum, Bedford is housed in the recreated Victorian home of the Higgins family of Victorian brewers and in a modern extension. The museum has local history collections, while the galleries have notable collections of watercolours, prints and drawings, ceramics, glass and lace.

The Panacea Museum tells the story of the Panacea Society, a religious community formed in the early twentieth century.

The Bedford Corn Exchange is the largest entertainment venue in the town and plays host to a variety of performances, meetings, conferences, concerts and private functions. The venue has been host to many great entertainers such as Glenn Miller and Bob Hope.

The University of Bedfordshire Theatre is the largest theatre in Bedford and hosts many larger productions as well as projects from the university. There is an active amdram (community theatre) scene, with groups such as the Swan Theatre Company, Bedford Drama Company (formerly Bedford Dramatic Club), Bedford Marianettes and ShowCo Bedford producing plays and musicals in venues like the Place Theatre and the Corn Exchange. The Bedford Pantomime Company produces a traditional pantomime at the Bedford Corn Exchange each Christmas. Esquires (one of the town&#x27;s premier live music venues) regularly plays host to many notable bands and acts from all over the United Kingdom as well as showcasing local live music.

Every two years, an event called the &quot;Bedford River Festival&quot; is held near the river in Bedford during early July. The event lasts for two days and regularly attracts about 250,000 visitors. The event includes sports, funfairs and live music. It is the second-largest regular outdoor event in the United Kingdom, beaten in numbers only by the Notting Hill Carnival. The Bedford Regatta each May is Britain&#x27;s largest one-day river rowing regatta.

Other annual events include &quot;Bedford by the Sea&quot; (when large quantities of sand are deposited in the town centre), the &quot;Bedford International Kite Festival&quot; and &quot;Bedford Festival of Motoring&quot; in June. &quot;Proms in the Park&quot;, held in early August, is a popular musical event.

Bedford&#x27;s special brand of the ordinary has resulted in regular small TV and radio appearances, for instance the upbeat episode of &quot;Mark Steel&#x27;s in Town&quot;, contrasting with the less enthusiastic treatment in &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;. The &quot;Bedford of Bedfordshire&#x27;s Community Calendar&quot; segment of this US show featured Bedford-born John Oliver.

==Tourism==
In December 2023, Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences announced that it had purchased 480 acres (later expanded to around 700 acres) of land on a former brickworks site near Stewartby, on the outskirts of Bedford, with the company exploring the possibility of building a theme park and resort in the area, citing Bedford&#x27;s proximity to London and Luton Airport.

In 2024, Universal Studios United Kingdom was announced to be in the planning and approval phases, with construction potentially beginning as early as January 2025, and the park itself slated for completion around 2030.

==New technologies==
Following successful rollouts of autonomous delivery robots in nearby Milton Keynes, Northampton and Cambridgeshire by Starship Technologies, in July 2022, the company announced a partnership with Bedford Borough Council and The Co-operative Group to rollout the autonomous robots in the Bedford built-up area, delivering from three Co-op stores in Goldington, Queens Drive and Kempston, an area spanning 45,000 residents and 20,000 households.

The town has four rugby union teams called Bedford Blues, Bedford Queens, Bedford Swifts and Bedford Athletic. Since 2004, Bedford also has a rugby league team, Bedford Tigers, who compete one tier below the National Conference.

Taking into account the size of its overall urban area, Bedford is one of the largest towns in England without a fully professional football team. Bedford Town F.C. currently plays at the seventh level of the English football league system and Real Bedford F.C. play at the eighth level.
Rowing is also a major part of the sports scene with a number of regatta events hosted throughout the year from February to October; the most significant of these being Bedford Regatta which, in terms of numbers of crews participating, is the second largest in the country. It was on Bedford&#x27;s River Great Ouse that Olympic rower, Tim Foster, honed his skills as a student of Bedford Modern and member of star club; indeed the borough has produced many other champions of sport past and present including Stephanie Cook, Gail Emms, Liz Yelling and Paula Radcliffe who is Life Vice-President of Bedford &amp; County Athletic Club

Bedford Borough was a major host of national teams preparing for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. The Maldives National Olympic Committee based its competing athletes in the borough, while Paralympic athletes from Angola, the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Gambia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Lesotho, Morocco, Niger, Pakistan, Senegal, Tunisia and Uganda were also based in the area. With the exception of Weymouth (which hosted various sailing events), Bedford Borough accommodated more Olympic teams in 2012 than any other local authority area in the United Kingdom.

The segment featured the Shuttleworth Collection, the Forest of Marston Vale, the Place Theatre, the Bedford Corn Exchange and local bookshop Rogan&#x27;s Books, among others.

==Public services==

Bedford Hospital is a district general hospital that operates from two sites in the town, providing a wide range of services, although patients requiring advanced health services are referred to specialist units elsewhere, particularly Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge, which has a partnership with Bedford Hospital. Bedford Hospital&#x27;s catchment area is based on the Borough of Bedford and parts of Central Bedfordshire.

<text>Word of Life () is a megachurch in Uppsala and an international association of churches, within the Swedish Word of Faith movement. Livets Ord is the foremost example of the Neo-charismatic movement in Sweden, closely related to Word of Faith, and it may be viewed as a Swedish expression of similar Pentecostal elements in American Christianity.

==History==
The congregation was founded in Uppsala by Ulf Ekman on May 24, 1983. In 1987, it dedicated its new building in Uppsala. In 2012, it founded Word of Life International, an association of churches it helped establish around the world. Ekman passed on the local pastorship in Uppsala to in 2013. On 9 March 2014, Ekman announced his and his wife&#x27;s leaving Livets Ord with the intent of joining the Catholic Church. In April 2022, Jan Blom was installed as the senior pastor. In August 2022, Jan Blom was injured in a serious motorcycle accident and is currently on sick leave. In the fall of 2023, Livets Ord implemented an interim leadership team of Simon Ahlstrand, Sebastian Asklund and Christian Åkerhielm.

Aside from church, the movement also runs academic schools for all ages and Bible Schools. It sends missionaries to Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Israel and India. In 2023, Word of Life International would have helped establish 1,000 churches.

==Operation Jabotinsky==
In conjunction with the Christian Zionists in the United States, the Livets Ord operate a fund to supply money to Russian Jews who want to move to Israel. The fund, named &quot;Operation Jabotinsky&quot;, is named after Russian Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky.

==Livets Ord Theological Seminary==
The congregation had its own institution of tertiary education, &quot;Livets Ord Theological Seminary&quot;, between 1994 and 2014. It was affiliated with an American institution, Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the largest charismatic Christian university in the world, accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Livets Ord Theological Seminary offered American Bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in New Testament Studies, History, Education, and other fields under the auspices of Oral Roberts University, but it was never accredited by the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education to award Swedish academic degrees.

In February 2014, Livets Ord announced its decision to close the seminary, because it had been operating under a loss for some time.

== Criticism ==

When it was founded, the movement met with criticism from mass media and other churches, due to what was perceived as an inhumane perspective against people who suffer from physical disabilities and financial poverty, coupled with its authoritarian leadership. Since then, the movement has consolidated, and its views have emerged as somewhat more acceptable to Swedish free churches. 

Some of its critics consider it a cult because of its connection with, and usage of theology from within, the Word of Faith movement, though its teachings now are broadened with other, more classical theology. 

In November 2015, the church was criticized in a television episode of Uppdrag granskning, notably by the demand of Ulf Ekman to be paid in cash during his interventions in churches, his culture of silence refusing any criticism and its insistence on multiple offerings, in addition to the tithe. Pastor Joakim Lundqvist confirmed that the weak culture of dialogue and the insistence on multiple offerings had indeed been problems, but that the church had implemented new policies over the years and that these problems were therefore no longer relevant.

==Popular culture==
A parody of the congregation exists in novel &quot;Berts bekymmer&quot;, where Klimpen returns to Öreskoga, now as a member of the congregation &quot;Lennarts ord&quot;. The congregation runs a bible school in Motala, and is led by a person named Lennart.

In Stieg Larsson&#x27;s novel, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, journalist Mikael Blomkvist&#x27;s daughter, Pernilla, is a member of the church. Her recognition of the Old Testament verses corresponding to a series of numbers in Harriet Vanger&#x27;s datebook (which Blomkvist initially took to be telephone numbers) helps her father to make the connection between Harriet&#x27;s disappearance in 1966 and a serial killer who used parodies of the punishments laid out in the Book of Leviticus as a &quot;signature&quot; for his murders of various women all over Sweden.

<text>Semiconservative replication describes the mechanism of DNA replication in all known cells. DNA replication occurs on multiple origins of replication along the DNA template strands. As the DNA double helix is unwound by helicase, replication occurs separately on each template strand in antiparallel directions. This process is known as semi-conservative replication because two copies of the original DNA molecule are produced, each copy conserving (replicating) the information from one half of the original DNA molecule. Each copy contains one original strand and one newly synthesized strand. (Both copies should be identical, but this is not entirely assured.) The structure of DNA (as deciphered by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in 1953) suggested that each strand of the double helix would serve as a template for synthesis of a new strand. It was not known how newly synthesized strands combined with template strands to form two double helical DNA molecules.

== Discovery ==

Multiple experiments were conducted to determine how DNA replicates. The semiconservative model was anticipated by Nikolai Koltsov and later supported by the Meselson–Stahl experiment, which confirmed that DNA replicated semi-conservatively by conducting an experiment using two isotopes: nitrogen-15 () and nitrogen-14 (). When was added to the heavy - DNA, a hybrid of - was seen in the first generation. After the second generation, the hybrid remained, but light DNA (-) was seen as well. This indicated that DNA replicated semi-conservatively. This mode of DNA replication allowed for each daughter strand to remain associated with its template strand.

== Nature of DNA replication ==

Semiconservative replication derives its name from the fact that this mechanism of transcription was one of three models originally proposedfor DNA replication:

* Semiconservative replication would produce two copies that each contained one of the original strands of DNA and one new strand.Semiconservative replication is beneficial to DNA repair. During replication, the new strand of DNA adjusts to the modifications made on the template strand.
* Conservative replication would leave the two original template DNA strands together in a double helix and would produce a copy composed of two new strands containing all of the new DNA base pairs.
* Dispersive replication would produce two copies of the DNA, both containing distinct regions of DNA composed of either both original strands or both new strands. The strands of DNA were originally thought to be broken at every tenth base pair to add the new DNA template. Eventually, all new DNA would make up the double helix after many generations of replication.

== Separation and recombination of double-stranded DNA ==
For semiconservative replication to occur, the DNA double-helix needs to be separated so the new template strand can be bound to the complementary base pairs. Topoisomerase is the enzyme that aids in the unzipping and recombination of the double-helix. Specifically, topoisomerase prevents the double-helix from supercoiling, or becoming too tightly wound. Three topoisomerase enzymes are involved in this process: Type IA Topoisomerase, Type IB Topoisomerase, and Type II Topoisomerase. Type I Topoisomerase unwinds double stranded DNA while Type II Topoisomerase breaks the hydrogen bonds linking the complementary base pairs of DNA.

== Rate and accuracy ==
The rate of semiconservative DNA replication in a living cell was first measured as the rate of the T4 phage DNA strand elongation in phage-infected &quot;E. coli&quot;. During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37 °C, the rate of strand elongation was 749 nucleotides per second. The mutation rate per base pair per round of replication during phage T4 DNA synthesis is . Thus, semiconservative DNA replication is both rapid and accurate.

== Applications ==
Semiconservative replication provides many advantages for DNA. It is fast, accurate, and allows for easy repair of DNA. It is also responsible for phenotypic diversity in a few prokaryotic species. The process of creating a newly synthesized strand from the template strand allows for the old strand to be methylated at a separate time from the new strand. This allows repair enzymes to proofread the new strand and correct any mutations or errors.

DNA could have the ability to activate or deactivate certain areas on the newly synthesized strand that allows the phenotype of the cell to be changed. This could be advantageous for the cell because DNA could activate a more favorable phenotype to aid in survival. Due to natural selection, the more favorable phenotype would persist throughout the species. This gives rise to the idea of inheritance, or why certain phenotypes are inherited over another.

<text>Abarth &amp; C. S.p.A. () is an Italian racing- and road-car maker and performance division founded by Italo-Austrian Carlo Abarth in 1949. Abarth &amp; C. S.p.A. is owned by Stellantis through its Italian subsidiary. Its logo is a shield with a stylized scorpion on a yellow and red background.

==History==
===1949: Abarth &amp; C.===

Carlo Abarth was sporting director of the Cisitalia racing team starting in 1947. The following year, the manufacturer folded, and founder Piero Dusio flew to Argentina.

Abarth, funded by Armando Scagliarini, took over Cisitalia&#x27;s assets and on 31 March 1949, Abarth &amp; C. was founded in Bologna. Carlo&#x27;s astrological sign, Scorpio, was chosen as the company logo.

From the Cisitalia liquidation, Abarth obtained five 204 sports cars (two complete Spiders and three unfinished), a D46 single-seater, and various spares. The Cisitalia 204s were immediately rechristened Abarth Cisitalia 204A. Abarth proceeded to build and race a series of sports cars developed from these last Cisitalia cars. In addition to Guido Scagliarini, the &quot;Squadra Abarth&quot; racing team lined up celebrated drivers, including Tazio Nuvolari, Franco Cortese, and Piero Taruffi. Notably, Tazio Nuvolari made his last appearance in racing at the wheel of an Abarth 204A, winning its class in the Palermo–Monte Pellegrino hillclimb on 10 April 1950. Alongside racing, the company&#x27;s main activity was producing and selling accessories and performance parts for Fiat, Lancia, Cisitalia, and Simca cars, like inlet manifolds and silencers.

On 9 April 1951, the company&#x27;s headquarters were moved to Turin; Abarth began his well-known association with Fiat in 1952, when the company built the Abarth 1500 Biposto on Fiat mechanicals.

In 1957, Abarth entered a deal with Fiat whereby they were paid direct fees for successful competition finishes. Abarth accordingly went on to enter their cars in countless hillclimbing and sports-car racing events across the world, mainly in classes from 850 to 2000 cc, competing with Porsche 904 and Ferrari Dino in the higher echelons. Since they were paid based on the number of results, Abarth entered their cars in every conceivable class and in countries across the entire world. Hans Herrmann was a factory driver from 1962 until 1965, winning the 500 km Nürburgring in 1963 with Teddy Pilette.

Abarth promised Johann Abt that he could race a factory car for free if he won all the races he entered. Abt almost succeeded; of the 30 races he entered, Abt won 29 and finished second once. Abt later founded Abt Sportsline.
Abarth produced high-performance exhaust pipes, diversifying into tuning kits for road vehicles, mainly for Fiat. A racing exhaust was produced for the 1950s Lambretta models &quot;D&quot; and &quot;LD&quot;. Original Abarth LD exhausts are now valuable collectors&#x27; items. Reproductions are available, which carry the Abarth name; how Fiat feels about this is not known. Lambretta even held several 125 cc motorcycle land speed records during the 1950s due partly to the exhaust that Abarth developed for them.

In 1958, Abarth developed the Abarth Alfa Romeo 1000 in collaboration with the Milanese manufacturer. They sent an engineer, Mario Colucci, to oversee the process. Abarth was impressed with his skill, and while the car remained a one-off, Colucci was given the position of Abarth&#x27;s Technical Director in 1960. Colucci&#x27;s first design was a mid-engined, tubular framed roadster using the 750 engine called the Abarth Spider Sport. This car had an unfortunate gestation period and never attained much success in competition, while Abarth himself favored the rear-engine layout and kept offering both types. The Spider Sport series was also built with 700 and 1000 cc displacements, while a few late examples were fitted with 1300 cc engines of Simca origins. Colucci&#x27;s next design, the Group 4 1000 SP, was much more successful and spawned a range of mid-engined, tubular-framed, fibreglass-bodied sports prototypes.

Abarth also helped build sports or racing cars with Porsche and Simca.

===1971: Fiat takeover===
Carlo sold Abarth to Fiat on 31 July 1971. The acquisition was not made public until 15 October. As Fiat was not interested in the Reparto Corse racing operations, these were taken over by Enzo Osella. Osella obtained cars, spares, technicians, and drivers (amongst them Arturo Merzario), and continued the racing activity, founding the Osella racing team. Thus ended for Abarth the days of sport prototype and hillclimb racing.

Under Fiat ownership, Abarth became the Fiat Group&#x27;s racing department, managed by engine designer Aurelio Lampredi. Abarth prepared Fiat&#x27;s rally cars, including the Fiat 124 Abarth Rally and 131 Abarth.
In December 1977, in advance of the 1978 racing season, the beforehand competing Abarth and Squadra Corse Lancia factory racing operations were merged by Fiat into a single entity named EASA (&quot;Ente per l&#x27;Attività Sportiva Automobilistica&quot;, Organization for Car Sports Racing Activities). Cesare Fiorio (previously in charge of the Lancia rally team) was appointed director, while Daniele Audetto was sporting director; the EASA headquarters were set up in Abarth&#x27;s Corso Marche (Turin) offices.
The combined racing department developed the Lancia Beta Montecarlo Turbo Group 5 racing car which won the 1980 World Championship for Makes and the 1981 World Endurance Championship of Makes. It also created the Lancia Rally 037 Group B rally car, which won for Lancia the 1983 World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship).

On 1 October 1981, Abarth &amp; C. ceased to exist, and was replaced by Fiat Auto Gestione Sportiva, a division of the parent company specialised in the management of racing programmes that would remain in operation through to the end of 1999, when it changed to Fiat Auto Corse S.p.A. 

Some commercial models built by Fiat or its subsidiaries Lancia and Autobianchi were co-branded Abarth, including the Autobianchi A112 Abarth, a lightweight and inexpensive &quot;boy racer&quot;. The A112 Abarth was introduced with a 58 hp engine, soon followed by a 70 hp one, and a specific &quot;A112 Abarth trophy&quot; was run from 1977 to 1984.

In the 1980s, Abarth name was mainly used to mark performance cars, such as the Fiat Ritmo Abarth 125/130 TC.

In 2000s, Fiat used the Abarth brand to designate a trim/model level, as in the Fiat Stilo Abarth.

===2007: Rebirth of Abarth &amp; C. S.p.A.===
On 1 February 2007, Abarth was re-established as an independent unit with the launch of the current company, Abarth &amp; C. S.p.A., controlled 100% by Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A., the subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. dealing with the production and selling of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.

The first models launched were the Abarth Grande Punto and the Abarth Grande Punto S2000. The brand is based in the Officine 83, part of the old Mirafiori engineering plant. The CEO as of 2022 is Olivier François.

In 2015, Abarth&#x27;s parent company was renamed FCA Italy S.p.A., reflecting the incorporation of Fiat S.p.A. into Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that took place in the previous months.

=== Yamaha XSR900 Abarth===
In 2017, Abarth collaborated with Yamaha to produce a limited-edition motorcycle, the &quot;Sport Heritage café racer special&quot;. Named the XSR900 Abarth it was based on the 847 cc inline-triple standard neo-retro Yamaha XSR900.

<doc id="69785" wikidata="Q19413" url="?curid=69785" title="Pelican">
<text>Pelicans (genus Pelecanus) are a genus of large water birds that make up the family Pelecanidae. They are characterized by a long beak and a large throat pouch used for catching prey and draining water from the scooped-up contents before swallowing. They have predominantly pale plumage, except for the brown and Peruvian pelicans. The bills, pouches, and bare facial skin of all pelicans become brightly coloured before the breeding season.

The eight living pelican species have a patchy, seasonally-dependent yet global distribution, ranging latitudinally from the tropics to the temperate zone. Pelicans are absent from interior Amazonian South America, from polar regions and the open ocean; at least one species is known to migrate to the inland desert of Australia&#x27;s Red Centre, after heavy rains create temporary lakes. White pelicans are also observed at the American state of Utah&#x27;s Great Salt Lake, for example, some 600 miles (965 km) from the nearest coastline (the Pacific West Coast). They have also been seen hundreds of miles inland in North America, having flown northwards along the Mississippi River and other large waterways.

Long thought to be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, and gannets and boobies, pelicans instead are most closely related to the shoebill and hamerkop storks (although these two birds are not actually &quot;true&quot; &#x27;storks&#x27;), and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes. Ibises, spoonbills, herons, and bitterns have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back at least 36 million years to the remains of a tibiotarsus recovered from late Eocene strata of Egypt that bears striking similarity to modern species of pelican. They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and New World lineages. This hypothesis is supported by fossil evidence from the oldest pelican taxa.

Pelicans will frequent inland waterways but are most known for residing along maritime and coastal zones, where they feed principally on fish in their large throat pouches, diving into the water and catching them at/near the water&#x27;s surface. They can adapt to varying degrees of water salinity, from freshwater and brackish to—most commonly—seawater. They are birds, travelling in flocks, hunting cooperatively, and breeding colonially. Four white-plumaged species tend to nest on the ground, and four brown or grey-plumaged species nest mainly in trees. The relationship between pelicans and people has often been contentious. The birds have been persecuted because of their perceived competition with commercial and recreational fishing. Their populations have fallen through habitat destruction, disturbance, and environmental pollution, and three species are of conservation concern. They also have a long history of cultural significance in mythology, and in Christian and heraldic iconography.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

===Etymology===
The name comes from the Ancient Greek word &quot;pelekan&quot; (πελεκάν), which is itself derived from the word &quot;pelekys&quot; (πέλεκυς) meaning &quot;axe&quot;. In classical times, the word was applied to both the pelican and the woodpecker.

The genus &quot;Pelecanus&quot; was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip, linear nostrils, a bare face, and fully webbed feet. This early definition included frigatebirds, cormorants, and sulids, as well as pelicans.

===Taxonomy===

The family Pelecanidae was introduced (as Pelicanea) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. Pelicans give their name to the Pelecaniformes, an order which has a varied taxonomic history. Tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, boobies, and frigatebirds, all traditional members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, Phaethontiformes, and the remainder into the Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop, and the shoebill have now been transferred into the Pelecaniformes. Molecular evidence suggests that the shoebill and the hamerkop form a sister group to the pelicans, though some doubt exists as to the exact relationships among the three lineages.

The oldest known record of Pelicans is a right tibiotarsus very similar to those of modern species from the Birket Qarun Formation in the Wadi El Hitan in Egypt, dating to the late Eocene (Priabonian), referred to the genus &quot;Eopelecanus.&quot; 


===Living species===
The eight living pelican species were traditionally divided into two groups, one containing four ground-nesters with mainly white adult plumage (Australian, Dalmatian, great white, and American white pelicans), and one containing four grey- or brown-plumaged species which nest preferentially either in trees (pink-backed, spot-billed and brown pelicans), or on sea rocks (Peruvian pelican). The largely marine brown and Peruvian pelicans, formerly considered conspecific, are sometimes separated from the others by placement in the subgenus &quot;Leptopelecanus&quot; but in fact species with both sorts of appearance and nesting behavior are found in either.

DNA sequencing of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes yielded quite different relationships; the three New World pelicans formed one lineage, with the American white pelican sister to the two brown pelicans, and the five Old World species the other. The Dalmatian, pink-backed, and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage, but was the first to diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species. This finding suggests that pelicans evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.

===Fossil record===
The fossil record shows that the pelican lineage has existed for at least 36 million years; the oldest known pelican fossil was assigned to &quot;Eopelecanus aegyptiacus&quot; and was found in late Eocene (middle to late part of the early Priabonian stage/age) deposits of the Birket Qarun Formation within the Wadi Al-Hitan World Heritage Site in Egypt. A more complete fossil pelican of early Oligocene age is known from deposits at the Luberon in southeastern France, and is remarkably similar to modern forms. Its beak is almost complete and is morphologically identical to that of present-day pelicans, showing that this advanced feeding apparatus was already in existence at the time. An Early Miocene fossil has been named &quot;Miopelecanus gracilis&quot; on the basis of certain features originally considered unique, but later thought to lie within the range of interspecific variation in &quot;Pelecanus&quot;. The Late Eocene &quot;Protopelicanus&quot; may be a pelecaniform or suliform – or a similar aquatic bird such as a pseudotooth (Pelagornithidae), but is not generally considered a pelecanid. The supposed Miocene pelican &quot;Liptornis&quot; from Patagonia is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; (of doubtful validity), being based on fragments providing insufficient evidence to support a valid description.

Fossil finds from North America have been meagre compared with Europe, which has a richer fossil record. Several &quot;Pelecanus&quot; species have been described from fossil material, including:
* &quot;Pelecanus cadimurka&quot;, Rich &amp; van Tets, 1981 (Late Pliocene, South Australia)
* &quot;Pelecanus cautleyi&quot;, Davies, 1880 (Early Pliocene, Siwalik Hills, India)
* &quot;Pelecanus fraasi&quot;, Lydekker, 1891 (Middle Miocene, Bavaria, Germany)
* &quot;Pelecanus gracilis&quot;, Milne-Edwards, 1863 (Early Miocene, France) (see: &quot;Miopelecanus&quot;)
* &quot;Pelecanus halieus&quot;, Wetmore, 1933 (Late Pliocene, Idaho, US)
* &quot;Pelecanus intermedius&quot;, Fraas, 1870 (Middle Miocene, Bavaria, Germany) (transferred to &quot;Miopelecanus&quot; by Cheneval in 1984)
* &quot;Pelecanus odessanus&quot;, Widhalm, 1886 (Late Miocene, near Odesa, Ukraine)
* &quot;Pelecanus paranensis&quot;, Noriega et al., 2023 (Late Miocene, Entre Ríos Province, Argentina)
* &quot;Pelecanus schreiberi&quot;, Olson, 1999 (Early Pliocene, North Carolina, US)
* &quot;Pelecanus sivalensis&quot;, Davies, 1880 (Early Pliocene, Siwalik Hills, India)
* &quot;Pelecanus tirarensis&quot;, Miller, 1966 (Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene, South Australia)

==Description==


Pelicans are very large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook at the end of the upper mandible, and the attachment of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish, and sometimes rainwater, though to not hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin, enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.

Males are generally larger than females and have longer bills. The smallest species is the brown pelican, small individuals of which can be no more than and long, with a wingspan of as little as . The largest is believed to be the Dalmatian, at up to and in length, with a maximum wingspan of . The Australian pelican&#x27;s bill may grow up to long in large males, the longest of any bird.

Pelicans have mainly light-coloured plumage, the exceptions being the brown and Peruvian pelicans. The bills, pouches, and bare facial skin of all species become brighter before breeding season commences. The throat pouch of the Californian subspecies of the brown pelican turns bright red, and fades to yellow after the eggs are laid, while the throat pouch of the Peruvian pelican turns blue. The American white pelican grows a prominent knob on its bill that is shed once females have laid eggs. The plumage of immature pelicans is darker than that of adults. Newly hatched chicks are naked and pink, darkening to grey or black after four to 14 days, then developing a covering of white or grey down.

===Air sacs===
Anatomical dissections of two brown pelicans in 1939 showed that pelicans have a network of air sacs under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast, and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in their bones. The air sacs are connected to the airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its glottis, but how air sacs are inflated is not clear. The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican&#x27;s body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen, where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.

==Distribution and habitat==
Modern pelicans are found on all continents except Antarctica. They primarily inhabit warm regions, although breeding ranges extend to latitudes of 45° South (Australian pelicans in Tasmania) and 60° North (American white pelicans in western Canada). Birds of inland and coastal waters, they are absent from polar regions, the deep ocean, oceanic islands (except the Galapagos), and inland South America, as well as from the eastern coast of South America from the mouth of the Amazon River southwards. Subfossil bones have been recovered from as far south as New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, although their scarcity and isolated occurrence suggests that these remains may have merely been vagrants from Australia (much as is the case today).

==Behaviour and ecology==

Pelicans swim well with their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub the backs of their heads on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they transfer to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks, and in shallow water.

A fibrous layer deep in the breast muscles can hold the wings rigidly horizontal for gliding and soaring. Thus, they use thermals for soaring to heights of 3,000 m (10,000 ft) or more, combined both with gliding and with flapping flight in V formation, to commute distances up to to feeding areas. Pelicans also fly low (or &quot;skim&quot;) over stretches of water, using a phenomenon known as ground effect to reduce drag and increase lift. As the air flows between the wings and the water surface, it is compressed to a higher density and exerts a stronger upward force against the bird above. Hence, substantial energy is saved while flying.

Adult pelicans rely on visual displays and behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy, as chicks vocalise extensively.

===Breeding and lifespan===
Pelicans are and nest colonially. Pairs are monogamous for a single season, but the pair bond extends only to the nesting area; mates are independent away from the nest. The ground-nesting (white) species have a complex communal courtship involving a group of males chasing a single female in the air, on land, or in the water while pointing, gaping, and thrusting their bills at each other. They can finish the process in a day. The tree-nesting species have a simpler process in which perched males advertise for females. The location of the breeding colony is constrained by the availability of an ample supply of fish to eat, although pelicans can use thermals to soar and commute for hundreds of kilometres daily to fetch food.

The Australian pelican has two reproductive strategies depending on the local degree of environmental predictability. Colonies of tens or hundreds, rarely thousands, of birds breed regularly on small coastal and subcoastal islands where food is seasonally or permanently available. In arid inland Australia, especially in the endorheic Lake Eyre basin, pelicans breed opportunistically in very large numbers of up to 50,000 pairs, when irregular major floods, which may be many years apart, fill ephemeral salt lakes and provide large amounts of food for several months before drying out again.

In all species, copulation takes place at the nest site; it begins shortly after pairing and continues for three to ten days before egg-laying. The male brings the nesting material, in ground-nesting species (which may not build a nest) sometimes in the pouch, and in tree-nesting species crosswise in the bill. The female then heaps the material up to form a simple structure.

The eggs are oval, white, and coarsely textured. All species normally lay at least two eggs; the usual clutch size is one to three, rarely up to six. Both sexes incubate with the eggs on top of or below the feet; they may display when changing shifts. Incubation takes 30–36 days; hatching success for undisturbed pairs can be as high as 95%, but because of sibling competition or siblicide, in the wild, usually all but one nestling dies within the first few weeks (later in the pink-backed and spot-billed species). Both parents feed their young. Small chicks are fed by regurgitation; after about a week, they are able to put their heads into their parents&#x27; pouches and feed themselves. Sometimes before, but especially after being fed the pelican chick may seem to &quot;throw a tantrum&quot; by loudly vocalizing and dragging itself around in a circle by one wing and leg, striking its head on the ground or anything nearby and the tantrums sometimes end in what looks like a seizure that results in the chick falling briefly unconscious; the reason is not clearly known, but a common belief is that it is to draw attention to itself and away from any siblings who are waiting to be fed.

Parents of ground-nesting species sometimes drag older young around roughly by the head before feeding them. From about 25 days old, the young of these species gather in &quot;pods&quot; or &quot;crèches&quot; of up to 100 birds in which parents recognise and feed only their own offspring. By six to eight weeks, they wander around, occasionally swimming, and may practise communal feeding. Young of all species fledge ten to 12 weeks after hatching. They may remain with their parents afterwards, but are now seldom or never fed. They are mature at three or four years old. Overall breeding success is highly variable. Pelicans live for 15 to 25 years in the wild, although one reached an age of 54 years in captivity.

===Feeding===
The diet of pelicans usually consists of fish, but occasionally amphibians, turtles, crustaceans, insects, birds, and mammals are also eaten. The size of the preferred prey fish varies depending on pelican species and location. For example, in Africa, the pink-backed pelican generally takes fish ranging in size from fry up to and the great white pelican prefers somewhat larger fish, up to , but in Europe, the latter species has been recorded taking fish up to . In deep water, white pelicans often fish alone. Nearer the shore, several encircle schools of small fish or form a line to drive them into the shallows, beating their wings on the water surface and then scooping up the prey. Although all pelican species may feed in groups or alone, the Dalmatian, pink-backed, and spot-billed pelicans are the only ones to prefer solitary feeding. When fishing in groups, all pelican species have been known to work together to catch their prey, and Dalmatian pelicans may even cooperate with great cormorants.
Large fish are caught with the bill-tip, then tossed up in the air to be caught and slid into the gullet head-first. A gull will sometimes stand on the pelican&#x27;s head, peck it to distraction, and grab a fish from the open bill. Pelicans in their turn sometimes snatch prey from other waterbirds.

The brown pelican usually plunge-dives head-first for its prey, from a height as great as , especially for anchovies and menhaden. The only other pelican to feed using a similar technique is the Peruvian pelican, but its dives are typically from a lower height than the brown pelican. The Australian and American white pelicans may feed by low plunge-dives landing feet-first and then scooping up the prey with the beak, but they—as well as the remaining pelican species—primarily feed while swimming on the water. Aquatic prey is most commonly taken at or near the water surface. Although principally a fish eater, the Australian pelican is also an eclectic and opportunistic scavenger and carnivore that forages in landfill sites, as well as taking carrion and &quot;anything from insects and small crustaceans to ducks and small dogs&quot;. Food is not stored in a pelican&#x27;s throat pouch, contrary to popular folklore.

Pelicans may also eat birds. In southern Africa, eggs and chicks of the Cape cormorant are an important food source for great white pelicans. Several other bird species have been recorded in the diet of this pelican in South Africa, including Cape gannet chicks on Malgas Island as well as crowned cormorants, kelp gulls, greater crested terns, and African penguins on Dassen Island and elsewhere. The Australian pelican, which is particularly willing to take a wide range of prey items, has been recorded feeding on young Australian white ibis, and young and adult grey teals and silver gulls. Brown pelicans have been reported preying on young common murres in California and the eggs and nestlings of cattle egrets and nestling great egrets in Baja California, Mexico. Peruvian pelicans in Chile have been recorded feeding on nestlings of imperial shags, juvenile Peruvian diving petrels, and grey gulls. Cannibalism of chicks of their own species is known from the Australian, brown, and Peruvian pelicans. Non-native great white pelicans have been observed swallowing city pigeons in St. James&#x27;s Park in London, England.

==Status and conservation==

===Populations===
Globally, pelican populations are adversely affected by these main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction of habitat, direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement in fishing lines and hooks, and the presence of pollutants such as DDT and endrin. Most species&#x27; populations are more or less stable, although three are classified by the IUCN as being at risk. All species breed readily in zoos, which is potentially useful for conservation management.

The combined population of brown and Peruvian pelicans is estimated at 650,000 birds, with around 250,000 in the United States and Caribbean, and 400,000 in Peru. The National Audubon Society estimates the global population of the brown pelican at 300,000. Numbers of brown pelican plummeted in the 1950s and 1960s, largely as a consequence of environmental DDT pollution, and the species was listed as endangered in the US in 1970. With restrictions on DDT use in the US from 1972, its population has recovered, and it was delisted in 2009.

The Peruvian pelican is listed as near threatened because, although the population is estimated by BirdLife International to exceed 500,000 mature individuals, and is possibly increasing, it has been much higher in the past. It declined dramatically during the 1998 El Niño event and could experience similar declines in the future. Conservation needs include regular monitoring throughout the range to determine population trends, particularly after El Niño years, restricting human access to important breeding colonies, and assessing interactions with fisheries.

The spot-billed pelican has an estimated population between 13,000 and 18,000 and is considered to be near threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Numbers declined substantially during the 20th century, one crucial factor being the eradication of the important Sittaung valley breeding colony in Burma through deforestation and the loss of feeding sites. The chief threats it faces are from habitat loss and human disturbance, but populations have mostly stabilised following increased protection in India and Cambodia.

The pink-backed pelican has a large population ranging over much of sub-Saharan Africa. In the absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range, its conservation status is assessed as being of least concern. Regional threats include the drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance in southern Africa. The species is susceptible to bioaccumulation of toxins and the destruction of nesting trees by logging.

The American white pelican has increased in numbers, with its population estimated at over 157,000 birds in 2005, becoming more numerous east of the continental divide, while declining in the west. However, whether its numbers have been affected by exposure to pesticides is unclear, as it has also lost habitat through wetland drainage and competition with recreational use of lakes and rivers.
Great white pelicans range over a large area of Africa and southern Asia. The overall trend in numbers is uncertain, with a mix of regional populations that are increasing, declining, stable, or unknown, but no evidence has been found of rapid overall decline, and the status of the species is assessed as being of least concern. Threats include the drainage of wetlands, persecution and sport hunting, disturbance at the breeding colonies, and contamination by pesticides and heavy metals.

The Dalmatian pelican has a population estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 following massive declines in the 19th and 20th centuries. The main ongoing threats include hunting, especially in eastern Asia, disturbance, coastal development, collision with overhead power lines, and the over-exploitation of fish stocks. It is listed as near threatened by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as the population trend is downwards, especially in Mongolia, where it is nearly extinct. However, several European colonies are increasing in size and the largest colony for the species, at the Small Prespa Lake in Greece, has reached about 1,400 breeding pairs following conservation measures.

Widespread across Australia, the Australian pelican has a population generally estimated at between 300,000 and 500,000 individuals. Overall population numbers fluctuate widely and erratically depending on wetland conditions and breeding success across the continent. The species is assessed as being of least concern.

===Culling and disturbance===
Pelicans have been persecuted by humans for their perceived competition for fish, despite the fact that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people. Starting in the 1880s, American white pelicans were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage. Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American white pelicans in southeastern Idaho in the US was seen to threaten the recreational cutthroat trout fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and culling.

Great white pelicans on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape region of South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation of the eggs and chicks of guano-producing seabirds was seen to threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors. More recently, such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened seabird populations, especially crowned cormorants, Cape cormorants, and bank cormorants. This has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies.

Apart from habitat destruction and deliberate, targeted persecution, pelicans are vulnerable to disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers, photographers, and other curious visitors. Human presence alone can cause the birds to accidentally displace or destroy their eggs, leave hatchlings exposed to predators and adverse weather, or even abandon their colonies completely.

===Poisoning and pollution===
DDT pollution in the environment was a major cause of decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican&#x27;s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.

In the late 1960s, following the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin. About 14,000 pelicans, including 7,500 American white pelicans, perished from botulism after eating fish from the Salton Sea in 1990. In 1991, abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and Brandt&#x27;s cormorants died at Santa Cruz, California, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with neurotoxic domoic acid, produced by the diatom &quot;Pseudo-nitzschia&quot;.

As waterbirds that feed on fish, pelicans are highly susceptible to oil spills, both directly by being oiled and by the impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that during the previous 20 years, some 500–1,000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, a year after the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed as a result of the spill.

Where pelicans interact with fishers, through either sharing the same waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines. Fish hooks are swallowed or catch in the skin of the pouch or webbed feet, and strong monofilament fishing line can become wound around bill, wings, or legs, resulting in crippling, starvation, and often death. Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife.

===Parasites and disease===
As with other bird families, pelicans are susceptible to a variety of parasites. Avian malaria is carried by the mosquito &quot;Culex pipens&quot;, and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies to be abandoned. Leeches may attach to the vent or sometimes the inside of the pouch. A study of the parasites of the American white pelican found 75 different species, including tapeworms, flukes, flies, fleas, ticks, and nematodes.

The brown pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites. The nematodes &quot;Contracaecum multipapillatum&quot; and &quot;C. mexicanum&quot; and the trematode &quot;Ribeiroia ondatrae&quot; have caused illness and mortality in the Puerto Rican population, possibly endangering the pelican on this island.

Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups, but several lice are very host-specific. Healthy pelicans can usually cope with their lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens a sick bird&#x27;s demise. The pouch louse &quot;Piagetiella peralis&quot; occurs in the pouch and so it cannot be removed by preening. While this is usually not a serious problem even when present in such numbers that it covers the whole interior of the pouch, sometimes inflammation and bleeding may occur from it and harm the host.

In May 2012, hundreds of Peruvian pelicans were reported to have perished in Peru from a combination of starvation and roundworm infestation.

==Religion, mythology, and popular culture==

The pelican (&quot;henet&quot; in Egyptian) was associated in Ancient Egypt with death and the afterlife. It was depicted in art on the walls of tombs, and figured in funerary texts, as a protective symbol against snakes. &quot;Henet&quot; was also referred to in the Pyramid Texts as the &quot;mother of the king&quot; and thus seen as a goddess. References in nonroyal funerary papyri show that the pelican was believed to possess the ability to prophesy safe passage in the underworld for someone who had died.

In Jewish dietary law, pelican is not considered kosher (fit for consumption), as it is a type of seabird and therefore considered an unclean animal.

An origin myth from the Murri people of Queensland, cited by Andrew Lang, describes how the Australian pelican acquired its black and white plumage. The story tells that the pelican was once a black bird. During a flood, he made a canoe to save drowning people. He fell in love with a woman and decided to save her, but she and her friends tricked him and escaped. The pelican consequently began preparing to go to war against them by daubing himself with white clay as war paint. Before he had finished, another pelican, on seeing such a strange piebald creature, killed him with its beak, and all such pelicans have been black and white ever since.

The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature. They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted pelicans in their art.

Alcatraz Island was given its name by the Spanish because of the large numbers of brown pelicans nesting there. The word &quot;alcatraz&quot; is itself derived from the Arabic &quot;al-caduos&quot;, a term used for a water-carrying vessel and likened to the pouch of the pelican. The English name albatross is also derived by corruption of the Spanish word.

===Christianity===

The &quot;Physiologus&quot;, a didactic Christian text from the 3rd or 4th century, claims that pelicans kill their young when they grow and strike their parents in the face, but then the mother laments them for three days, after which she strikes her side and brings them back to life with her blood. The &quot;Physiologus&quot; explains this as mirroring the pain inflicted on God by people&#x27;s idolatry, and the self-sacrifice of Jesus on the cross which redeems the sinful (see the blood and water gushing from the wound in his side). This text was widely copied, translated, and sometimes closely paraphrased during the Middle Ages, for instance by 13th-century authors Guillaume le Clerc and Bartholomaeus Anglicus.

In a newer, also medieval version of the European myth, the pelican was thought to be particularly attentive to her young, to the point of providing them with blood by wounding her own breast when no other food was available. As a result, the pelican came to symbolise the Passion of Jesus and the Eucharist, supplementing the image of the lamb and the flag. This mythical characteristic is referenced in the hymn &quot;Adoro te devote&quot; (&quot;Humbly We Adore Thee&quot;), where in the penultimate verse, Saint Thomas Aquinas describes Christ as the loving divine pelican, one drop of whose blood can save the world. Similarly, the 1678 Christian allegorical novel &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; describes how &quot;the pelican pierce[s] her own breast with her bill … to nourish her young ones with her blood, and thereby to show that Christ the blessed so loveth his young, his people, as to save them from death by his blood.&quot;

Elizabeth I of England adopted the symbol, portraying herself as the &quot;mother of the Church of England&quot;. A portrait of her called the Pelican Portrait was painted around 1573, probably by Nicholas Hilliard.

The pelican is featured in many Christian artworks, especially in Europe. For example, the first (1611) edition of the King James Bible contains a depiction of a pelican feeding her young in an oval panel at the bottom of the title page. The &quot;pelican in her piety&quot; appears in the 1686 reredos by Grinling Gibbons in the church of St Mary Abchurch in the City of London. Earlier medieval examples of the motif appear in painted murals, for example, the mural in the parish church of Belchamp Walter, Essex (c. 1350).

The self-sacrificial characterization of the pelican was reinforced by widely read medieval bestiaries. The device of &quot;a pelican in her piety&quot; or &quot;a pelican vulning (from Latin , &quot;I wound, I injure, I hurt&quot;) herself&quot; was used in religious iconography and heraldry.

====Origin in nature====
The legends of self-wounding and the provision of blood occur across cultures. For example, an Indian folktale depicts a pelican that killed her young by rough treatment, but was then so contrite that she resurrected them with her own blood. Such legends may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this onto its chest to fully empty the pouch. Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the Dalmatian pelican has a blood-red pouch in the early breeding season and this may have contributed to the myth.

====Heraldry====

Pelicans have featured extensively in heraldry, generally using the Christian symbolism of the pelican as a caring and self-sacrificing parent. Heraldic images featuring a &quot;pelican vulning&quot; refers to a pelican injuring herself, while a &quot;pelican in her piety&quot; refers to a female pelican feeding her young with her own blood. The King of Portugal John II adopted the pelican as is own personal sygil while he was Infante, evoking the Christian symbology to equate the sacrifice of his blood to feed the nation. The pelican as a symbol also became synonymous with the increasing charity efforts of the Santas Casas da Misericórdia during his reign and the reconstruction of the Hospital das Caldas da Rainha and the Hospital Real de Todos-os-Santos, which were mainly patronaged by his wife D. Leonor.

The image became linked to the medieval religious feast of Corpus Christi. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge each have colleges named for the religious festival nearest the dates of their establishment, and both Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, feature pelicans on their coats of arms.

The medical faculties of Charles University in Prague also have a pelican as their emblem. The symbol of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a pelican, and for most of its existence the headquarters of the service was located at Pelican House in Dublin, Ireland. The heraldic pelican also ended up as a pub name and image, though sometimes with the image of the ship &quot;Golden Hind&quot;. Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s famous ship was initially called &quot;Pelican&quot;, and adorned the British halfpenny coin.

===Modern usage===
The great white pelican is the national bird of Romania. The brown pelican is the national bird of three Caribbean countries—Saint Kitts and Nevis, Barbados, and Sint Maarten—and features on their coats of arms. It is also the state bird of the US state of Louisiana, which is known colloquially as the Pelican State; the bird appears on the state flag and state seal. It adorns the seals of Louisiana State University, Tulane University, Louisiana Tech University, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Loyola University New Orleans, Southeastern Louisiana University, and Southern University, and is the mascot of the New Orleans Pelicans NBA team, the Lahti Pelicans ice hockey team, Tulane University, and the University of the West Indies. A white pelican logo is used by the Portuguese bank Montepio Geral, and a pelican is depicted on the reverse of the Albanian 1 lek coin, issued in 1996. The name and image were used for Pelican Books, an imprint of nonfiction books published by Penguin Books. The seal of the Packer Collegiate Institute, a pelican feeding her young, has been in use since 1885.

The pelican is the subject of a popular limerick originally composed by Dixon Lanier Merritt in 1910 with several variations by other authors. The original version ran:

<doc id="69788" wikidata="Q570868" url="?curid=69788" title="Hebrews">
<text>The Hebrews (; ) were an ancient Semitic-speaking people. Historians mostly consider the Hebrews as synonymous with the Israelites, with the term &quot;Hebrew&quot; denoting an Israelite from the nomadic era, which preceded the establishment of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah in the 11th century BCE. However, in some instances, the designation &quot;Hebrew&quot; may also be used historically in a wider sense, referring to the Phoenicians or other ancient Semitic-speaking civilizations, such as the Shasu on the eve of the Late Bronze Age collapse. It appears 34 times within 32 verses of the Hebrew Bible. Some scholars regard &quot;Hebrews&quot; as an ethnonym, while others do not, and others still hold that the multiple modern connotations of ethnicity may not all map well onto the sociology of ancient Near Eastern groups.

By the time of the Roman Empire, the term () could refer to the Jews in general (as &quot;Strong&#x27;s Hebrew Dictionary&quot; puts it: &quot;any of the Jewish Nation&quot;) or, at other times, specifically to those Jews who lived in Judea, which was a Roman province from 6 CE to 135 CE. However, at the time of early Christianity, the term instead referred to Jewish Christians, as opposed to the Judaizers and to the gentile Christians.

In Armenian, Georgian, Italian, Greek, Kurdish, Serbian, Russian, Romanian, and a few other languages, the transfer of the name from &quot;Hebrew&quot; to &quot;Jew&quot; never took place, and &quot;Hebrew&quot; (or the linguistic equivalent) remains the primary word used to refer to an ethnic Jew.

With the revival of the Hebrew language in the 19th century and with the emergence of the Yishuv, the term &quot;Hebrew&quot; has been applied to the Jewish people of this re-emerging society in Israel or to the Jewish people in general.

==Etymology==
The biblical term &quot;Ivri&quot; (; ) is usually rendered as &quot;Hebrew&quot; in English (; ). The biblical word &quot;Ivri&quot; has the plural form &quot;Ivrim&quot;, or &quot;Ibrim&quot;. The definitive origin of the term &quot;Hebrew&quot; remains uncertain.

The most generally accepted hypothesis today is that the text intends &quot;ivri&quot; as the adjective (Hebrew suffix -i) formed from &quot;ever&quot; (עֵבֶר) &#x27;beyond, across&#x27; (avar (עָבַר) &#x27;he crossed, he traversed&#x27;), as a description of migrants &#x27;from across the river&#x27; as the Bible describes the Hebrews. It is also supported by the 3rd century BCE Septuagint, which translates &quot;ivri&quot; to &quot;perates&quot; (περατής), a Greek word meaning &quot;one who came across, a migrant&quot;, from &quot;perao&quot; (περάω) &quot;to cross, to traverse&quot;, as well as some early traditional commentary. Gesenius considers it the only linguistically acceptable hypothesis. The description of peoples and nations from their location &quot;from across the river&quot; (often the river Euphrates, sometimes the Jordan River) was common in this region of the ancient Near-East: it appears as &quot;eber nari&quot; in Akkadian and &quot;avar nahara&quot; in Aramaic (both corresponding to Hebrew &quot;ever nahar&quot;), the Aramaic expression&#x27;s use being quoted verbatim in the Bible, for example in an Aramaic letter sent to the King of Persia in the Book of Ezra or in the Book of Nehemiah, sometimes rendered as Trans-Euphrates.


 refers to Shem, the elder brother of Ham and Japheth, and thus the first-born son of Noah, as the father of the sons of Eber (עבר), which may have a similar meaning.

Some authors such as Radak and R. Nehemiah argue that &quot;Ibri&quot; denotes the descendants of the biblical patriarch Eber (Hebrew עבר), son of Shelah, a great-grandson of Noah and an ancestor of Abraham, hence the occasional anglicization &quot;Eberites&quot;. Others disagree, arguing that the Eberites and Hebrews were two different ethnicities, with the former specifically inhabiting Assyria. Nonetheless, the descent of Hebrews from Eber is acknowledged.

Since the 19th-century CE discovery of the second-millennium BCE inscriptions mentioning the Habiru, many theories have linked these to the Hebrews. Some scholars argue that the name &quot;Hebrew&quot; is related to the name of those semi-nomadic Habiru people recorded in Egyptian inscriptions of the 13th and 12th centuries BCE as having settled in Egypt. Other scholars rebut this, proposing that the Hebrews are mentioned in later texts of the 3rd Intermediate Period of Egypt (11th century BCE) as Shasu of &quot;Yhw&quot;, while some scholars consider these two hypotheses compatible, &quot;Ḫabiru&quot; being a generic Akkadian form parallel to Hebrew &quot;ʿivri&quot; from the Akkadian equivalent of &quot;ʿever&quot; &quot;beyond, across&quot; describing foreign peoples &quot;from across the river&quot;, where the letter ayin (ע) in Hebrew corresponds to &quot;ḫ&quot; in Akkadian (as in Hebrew &quot;zeroaʿ&quot; corresponding to Akkadian &quot;zuruḫ&quot;). Alternatively, some argue that Habiru refers to a social class found in every ancient Near Eastern society, which Hebrews could be part of.

==Use as synonym for &quot;Israelites&quot;==

In the Hebrew Bible, the term &quot;Hebrew&quot; is normally used by foreigners (namely, the Egyptians) when speaking about Israelites and sometimes used by Israelites when speaking of themselves to foreigners, although Saul does use the term for his fellow countrymen in . In , Abraham (Abram) is described as a descendant of Eber; Josephus states &quot;Eber&quot; was the patriarch that Hebrew was named after proceeding from the Tower of Babel at the time of Eber&#x27;s son Peleg, from which &quot;Hebrew&quot; would eventually become derived.

According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; the terms &quot;Hebrews&quot; and &quot;Israelites&quot; usually describe the same people, stating that they were called Hebrews before the conquest of the Land of Canaan and Israelites afterwards. 

Professor Nadav Na&#x27;aman and others say that the conflation of Hebrew with Israelite is rare and is only used when Israelites are &quot;in exceptional and precarious situations, such as migrants or slaves.&quot; Professor Albert D. Friedberg similarly argues that Hebrews refer to socioeconomically disadvantaged Israelites, especially in the context of the Book of Exodus and Books of Samuel.

In , Abraham is described as &quot;Avram Ha-Ivri&quot; which translates literally as &quot;Abram the Hebrew.&quot; Hebrew, in this context, might refer to Abraham&#x27;s descent from Eber. It might also refer to Abraham&#x27;s primary language or his status as a migrant from the &quot;other side of the river&quot;.

Theologian Alexander MacLaren believes that Hebrew was a nickname for all migrants who migrated to Canaan from the other side of the Euphrates River (or the Jordan River), from the perspective of the &#x27;long-settled&#x27; aboriginal inhabitants of Canaan. 

== Use as synonym for &quot;Jews&quot; ==

By the Roman period, &quot;Hebrews&quot; could be used to designate the Jews, who use the Hebrew language. The Epistle to the Hebrews, one of the books of the New Testament, was probably directed at Jewish Christians.

In some modern languages, including Armenian, Greek, Italian, Romanian, and many Slavic languages, the name &quot;Hebrews&quot; (with linguistic variations) is the standard ethnonym for Jews; but in many other languages in which both terms exist, it is currently considered derogatory to call Jews &quot;Hebrews&quot;.

Among certain left-wing or liberal circles of Judaic cultural lineage, the word &quot;Hebrew&quot; is used as an alternatively secular description of the Jewish people (e.g., Bernard Avishai&#x27;s &quot;The Hebrew Republic&quot; or left-wing wishes for a &quot;Hebrew-Arab&quot; joint cultural republican state). It is also used in some circles as a secular description of people of Judaic cultural lineage who practice other religions or none, including Hebrew Catholics.

=== Use in Zionism ===
Beginning in the late 19th century, the term &quot;Hebrew&quot; became popular among secular Zionists. In this context, the word alluded to the transformation of the Jews into a strong, independent, self-confident secular national group (&quot;the New Jew&quot;) sought by classical Zionism. This use died out after the establishment of the state of Israel, when &quot;Hebrew&quot; was replaced with &quot;Jew&quot; or &quot;Israeli&quot;.

David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, believed that the Hebrews were the indigenous inhabitants of Canaan that joined Abraham&#x27;s religion, after he settled in the region. He also believed that not all Hebrews joined Jacob&#x27;s family when they migrated to Egypt and later, birthed the generation of Hebrews that endured the Exodus.

<doc id="69790" wikidata="Q665319" url="?curid=69790" title="Broadsheet">
<text>A broadsheet is the largest newspaper format and is characterized by long vertical pages, typically of in height. Other common newspaper formats include the smaller Berliner and tabloid–compact formats.

Historically, the broadsheet format emerged in the 17th century as a means for printing musical and popular prints, and later became a medium for political activism through the reprinting of speeches. In Britain, the broadsheet newspaper developed in response to a 1712 tax on newspapers based on their page counts. Outside Britain, the broadsheet evolved for various reasons, including style and authority.

Broadsheets are often associated with more intellectual and in-depth content compared to their tabloid counterparts, featuring detailed stories and less sensational material. They are commonly used by newspapers aiming to provide comprehensive coverage and analysis of news events. The format allows for a more expansive layout, often featuring multiple stories on the front page, with the most important ones positioned &quot;above the fold&quot;.

In the 21st century, some newspapers have switched from the broadsheet format to smaller sizes, such as the Berliner or compact formats, to improve convenience for readers, especially commuters. This trend has been observed in various countries, including the UK and the US, where notable broadsheets like &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; have adopted smaller formats.

==Description==
Many broadsheets measure roughly per full broadsheet spread, twice the size of a standard tabloid. Australian and New Zealand broadsheets always have a paper size of A1 per spread (). South African broadsheet newspapers have a double-page spread sheet size of (single-page live print area of 380 x 545 mm). Others measure 22 in (560 mm) vertically.

In the United States, the traditional dimensions for the front page half of a broadsheet are wide by long. However, in efforts to save newsprint costs, many U.S. newspapers have downsized to wide by long for a folded page.

Many rate cards and specification cards refer to the &quot;broadsheet size&quot; with dimensions representing the front page &quot;half of a broadsheet&quot; size, rather than the full, unfolded broadsheet spread. Some quote actual page size and others quote the &quot;printed area&quot; size.

The two versions of the broadsheet are:
*The full broadsheet typically is folded vertically in half so that it forms four pages (the front page front and back and the back page front and back). The four pages are called a spread. Inside broadsheets are nested accordingly.
*The half broadsheet is usually an inside page that is not folded vertically and just includes a front and back.

==History==
The broadsheet, broadside, was used as a format for musical and popular prints in the 17th century. 
Eventually, people began using the broadsheet as a source for political activism by reprinting speeches.

Broadsheet newspapers developed in Britain after a 1712 tax was imposed on newspapers based on their page counts. However, larger formats had long been signs of status in printed objects and still are in many places. Outside of Britain the broadsheet developed for other reasons unrelated to the British tax structure including style and authority. With the early mechanization of the 19th century came an increased production of printed materials including the broadside, as well as the competing penny dreadful. Newspapers all over Europe were then starting to print their issues on broadsheets. However, in the United Kingdom, the main competition for the broadside was the gradual reduction of the newspaper tax, beginning in the 1830s until its eventual dismissal in 1855.

With the increased production of newspapers and literacy, the demand for visual reporting and journalists led to the blending of broadsides and newspapers, creating the modern broadsheet newspaper.

==Printing considerations==
Modern printing facilities efficiently print broadsheet sections in multiples of eight pages (with four front pages and four back pages). The broadsheet is then cut in half during the process. Thus, the newsprint rolls used are defined by the width necessary to print four front pages. The width of a newsprint roll is called its web. The now-common 11-inch-wide front page broadsheet newspapers in the United States use a 44-inch web newsprint roll.

With profit margins narrowing for newspapers in the wake of competition from broadcast, cable television, and the internet, newspapers are looking to standardize the size of the newsprint roll. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; with its 12-inch-wide front page was printed on 48-inch web newsprint. Early adopters in the downsizing of broadsheets used a 50-inch web (-inch front pages). However, the 48-inch web is now rapidly becoming the definitive standard in the U.S. &quot;The New York Times&quot; held out on the downsizing until July 2006, saying it would stick to its 54-inch web (-inch front page). However, the paper adopted the narrower format beginning Monday, 6 August 2007.

The smaller newspapers also have the advantage of being easier to handle, particularly among commuters.

==Connotations==
In some countries, especially Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US, broadsheet newspapers are commonly perceived to be more intellectual in content than their tabloid counterparts. They tend to use their greater size to publish stories exploring topics in-depth and carry less sensationalist and celebrity-oriented material. The distinction is most obvious on the front page since tabloids tend to have a single story dominated by a headline, and broadsheets allow two or more stories to be displayed of which the most important sit at the top of the page &quot;above the fold.&quot;

A few newspapers, though, such as the German &quot;Bild-Zeitung&quot; and others throughout Central Europe are tabloids in terms of content but use the physical broadsheet format.

==Switch to smaller sizes==

===In the United Kingdom===
In 2003, &quot;The Independent&quot; started concurrent production of both broadsheet and tabloid (&quot;compact&quot;) editions, carrying exactly the same content. &quot;The Times&quot; did likewise, but with less apparent success, with readers vocally opposing the change. &quot;The Independent&quot; ceased to be available in broadsheet format in May 2004, and &quot;The Times&quot; followed suit from November 2004; &quot;The Scotsman&quot; is also now published only in tabloid format. &quot;The Guardian&quot; switched to the &quot;Berliner&quot; or &quot;midi&quot; format found in some other European countries (slightly larger than a traditional tabloid) on 12 September 2005. In June 2017, the &quot;Guardian&quot; announced it would again change the format to tabloid size – the first tabloid edition was published on 15 January 2018.

The main motivation cited for this shift was that commuters prefer papers that they can hold easily on public transport and that other readers also might find the smaller formats more convenient.

===In the United States===
In the United States, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; made headlines when it announced its overseas version would convert to a tabloid on 17 October 2005. Strong debate occurred in the US on whether or not the rest of the national papers will or even should follow the trend of the European papers and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; overseas edition switched back to a broadsheet format in 2015.

<text>An oath of fealty, from the Latin fidelitas (faithfulness), is a pledge of allegiance of one person to another.

==Definition==
In medieval Europe, the swearing of fealty took the form of an oath made by a vassal, or subordinate, to his lord. &quot;Fealty&quot; also referred to the duties incumbent upon a vassal that were owed to the lord, which consisted of service and aid.

One part of the oath of fealty included swearing to always remain faithful to the lord. The oath of fealty usually took place after the act of homage, when, by the symbolic act of kneeling before the lord and placing his hands between the hands of the lord, the vassal became the &quot;man&quot; of the lord. Usually, the lord also promised to provide for the vassal in some form, either through the granting of a fief or by some other manner of support. Typically, the oath took place upon a religious object such as a Bible or saint&#x27;s relic, often contained within an altar, thus binding the oath-taker before God. Fealty and homage were key elements of European feudalism.

Fealty is distinct from other parts of the homage ceremony, and is usually used only to refer to that part of the ceremony where a vassal swore to be a good vassal to his lord.

==History==
In medieval Europe, an oath of fealty (German: Lehnseid) was a fundamental element of the feudal system in the Holy Roman Empire. It was sworn between two people, the feudal subject or liegeman (&quot;vassal&quot;) and his feudal superior (&quot;liege lord&quot;). The oath of allegiance was usually carried out as part of a traditional ceremony in which the liegeman or vassal gave his lord a pledge of loyalty and acceptance of the consequences of a breach of trust. In return, the liege lord promised to protect and remain loyal to his vassal. This relationship formed the basis of landholding, known as feudal tenure, whereby the seizin vested in the tenant (the vassal) was so similar to actual possession that it was considered a separate estate described as utile domain (&quot;dominium utile&quot;), literally &quot;beneficial ownership&quot;, whereas the landlord&#x27;s estate was referred to as eminent domain or superiority (&quot;dominium directum&quot;, lit. &quot;direct ownership&quot;).

In the Late Middle Ages, the investiture and oath of fealty were invariably recorded by a deed; in modern times, this replaced the traditional ceremony. Where the geographical distance between the two parties was significant, the lord could name a representative before whom the oath was to be sworn.

The whole contract including the oath of fealty was part of a formal commendation ceremony that created the feudal relationship.

The term is also used by English-speakers to refer to similar oaths of allegiance in other feudal cultures, as with medieval Japan, as well as in modern organized crime.

<doc id="69793" wikidata="Q934140" url="?curid=69793" title="Cryptic crossword">
<text>A cryptic crossword is a crossword puzzle in which each clue is a word puzzle. Cryptic crosswords are particularly popular in the United Kingdom, where they originated, as well as Ireland, the Netherlands, and in several Commonwealth nations, including Australia, Canada, India, Kenya, Malta, New Zealand, and South Africa. Compilers of cryptic crosswords are commonly called &quot;setters&quot; in the UK and &quot;constructors&quot; in the US. Particularly in the UK, a distinction may be made between cryptics and &quot;quick&quot; (i.e. standard) crosswords, and sometimes two sets of clues are given for a single puzzle grid.

Cryptic crossword puzzles come in two main types: the basic cryptic in which each clue answer is entered into the diagram normally, and &quot;themed&quot; or &quot;variety&quot; cryptics, in which some or all of the answers must be altered before entering, usually in accordance with a hidden pattern or rule which must be discovered by the solver.

== History and development ==
Cryptic crosswords originated in the UK. The first British crossword puzzles appeared around 1923 and were purely definitional, but from the mid-1920s they began to include cryptic material: not cryptic clues in the modern sense, but anagrams, classical allusions, incomplete quotations, and other references and wordplay. Torquemada (Edward Powys Mathers), who set for &quot;The Saturday Westminster&quot; from 1925 and for &quot;The Observer&quot; from 1926 until his death in 1939, was the first setter to use cryptic clues exclusively and is often credited as the inventor of the cryptic crossword.

The first newspaper crosswords appeared in the &quot;Sunday&quot; and &quot;Daily Express&quot; from about 1924. Crosswords were gradually taken up by other newspapers, appearing in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; from 1925, &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; from 1929 and &quot;The Times&quot; from 1930. These newspaper puzzles were almost entirely non-cryptic at first and gradually used more cryptic clues, until the fully cryptic puzzle as known today became widespread. In some papers this took until about 1960. Puzzles appeared in &quot;The Listener&quot; from 1930, but this was a weekly magazine rather than a newspaper, and the puzzles were much harder than the newspaper ones, though again they took a while to become entirely cryptic. Composer Stephen Sondheim, a lover of puzzles, is credited with introducing cryptic crosswords to American audiences, through a series of puzzles he created for &quot;New York&quot; magazine in 1968 and 1969.

Torquemada&#x27;s puzzles were extremely obscure and difficult, and later setters reacted against this tendency by developing a standard for fair clues, ones that can be solved, at least in principle, by deduction, without needing leaps of faith or insights into the setter&#x27;s thought processes.

The basic principle of fairness was set out by &quot;Listener&quot; setter Afrit (Alistair Ferguson Ritchie) in his book &quot;Armchair Crosswords&quot; (1946), wherein he credits it to the fictional &quot;Book of the Crossword&quot;:

An example of a clue which cannot logically be taken the right way:
Here the composer intends the answer to be , with &quot;hat&quot; the definition, &quot;could be&quot; the anagram indicator, and the anagram fodder. I.e., &quot;derby&quot; is an anagram of &quot;be dry&quot;. But &quot;be&quot; is doing double duty, and this means that any attempt to read the clue cryptically in the form &quot;[definition] [anagram indicator] [fodder]&quot; fails: if &quot;be&quot; is part of the anagram indicator, then the fodder is too short, but if it is part of the fodder, there is no anagram indicator; to be a correct clue it would have to be &quot;Hat could be be dry (5)&quot;, which is ungrammatical. A variation might read &quot;Hat turns out to be dry (5)&quot;, but this also fails because the word &quot;to&quot;, which is necessary to make the sentence grammatical, follows the indicator (&quot;turns out&quot;) even though it is not part of the anagram indicated.

Torquemada&#x27;s successor at &quot;The Observer&quot; was Ximenes (Derrick Somerset Macnutt), and in his influential work, &quot;Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword Puzzle&quot; (1966), he set out more detailed guidelines for setting fair cryptic clues, now known as &quot;Ximenean principles&quot; and sometimes described by the phrase &quot;square-dealing&quot;. The most important of them are tersely summed up by Ximenes&#x27; successor Azed (Jonathan Crowther):

The Ximenean principles are adhered to most strictly in the subgenre of &quot;advanced cryptics&quot;—difficult puzzles using barred grids and a large vocabulary. Easier puzzles often have more relaxed standards, permitting a wider array of clue types, and allowing a little flexibility. The popular &quot;Guardian&quot; setter Araucaria (John Galbraith Graham) was a noted non-Ximenean, celebrated for his witty, if occasionally unorthodox, clues.

== Popularity ==
Most of the major national newspapers in the UK carry both cryptic and concise (quick) crosswords in every issue. The puzzle in &quot;The Guardian&quot; is well loved for its humour and quirkiness, and quite often includes puzzles with themes, which are extremely rare in &quot;The Times&quot;.

Many Canadian newspapers, including the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, carry cryptic crosswords.

Cryptic crosswords do not commonly appear in U.S. publications, although they can be found in magazines such as &quot;GAMES Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and occasionally in the Sunday &quot;New York Times&quot;. The &quot;New York Post&quot; reprints cryptic crosswords from &quot;The Times&quot;. In April 2018, The New Yorker published the first of a new weekly series of cryptic puzzles. Other sources of cryptic crosswords in the U.S. (at various difficulty levels) are puzzle books, as well as UK and Canadian newspapers distributed in the U.S. Other venues include the &quot;Enigma&quot;, the magazine of the National Puzzlers&#x27; League, and formerly, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. The latter puzzle, after a long and distinguished run, appeared solely on &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s website for several years, and ended with the October 2009 issue. A similar puzzle by the same authors now appears every four weeks in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, beginning in January 2010. Cryptic crosswords have become more popular in the United States in the years following the COVID-19 lockdowns with several &quot;indie&quot; outlets and setters.

Cryptic crosswords are very popular in Australia. Most Australian newspapers will have at least one cryptic crossword, if not two. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot; in Melbourne publish daily cryptic crosswords, including Friday&#x27;s challenging cryptic by &#x27;DA&#x27; (David Astle). &quot;Lovatts&quot;, an Australian puzzle publisher, regularly issues cryptic crossword puzzle books.

== How cryptic clues work ==
A cryptic clue leads to its answer only if it is read in the right way. What the clue appears to say when read normally (the &quot;surface reading&quot;) is usually a distraction with nothing to do with the solution. The challenge is to find the way of reading the clue that leads to the solution. A typical clue consists of two parts:

* The &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;definition&quot;. This is in essence the same as any non-cryptic crossword clue: a synonym for the answer. It usually exactly matches the part of speech, tense, and number of the answer, and usually appears at the start or end of a clue.
* The &quot;cryptic&quot;, &quot;subsidiary indication&quot; or &quot;wordplay&quot;. This gives the solver some instructions on how to get to the answer in another (less literal) way. The wordplay parts of clues can be obscure, especially to a newcomer, but they tend to utilise standard rules and conventions which become more familiar with practice.

Sometimes the two parts of the clue are joined with a link word or phrase such as &quot;from&quot;, &quot;gives&quot; or &quot;could be&quot;. One of the tasks of the solver is to find the boundary between the definition and the wordplay, and insert a mental pause there when reading the clue &quot;cryptically&quot;.

There are many sorts of wordplay, such as anagrams and double definitions, but they all conform to rules. The crossword setters do their best to stick to these rules when writing their clues, and solvers can use these rules and conventions to help them solve the clues. Noted cryptic setter Derrick Somerset Macnutt (who wrote cryptics under the pseudonym of Ximenes) discusses the importance and art of fair cluemanship in his seminal book on cryptic crosswords, &quot;Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword&quot; (1966, reprinted 2001).

Because a typical cryptic clue describes its answer in detail and often more than once, the solver can usually have a great deal of confidence in the answer once it has been determined. The clues are &quot;self-checking.&quot; This is in contrast to non-cryptic crossword clues which often have several possible answers and force the solver to use the crossing letters to distinguish which was intended.

Here is an example (taken from &quot;The Guardian&quot; crossword of 6 August 2002, set by &quot;Shed&quot;).

:15D &quot;Very sad unfinished story about rising smoke (8)&quot;

is a clue for . This breaks down as follows.
*15D indicates the location and direction (down) of the solution in the grid
*&quot;Very sad&quot; is the definition
*&quot;unfinished story&quot; gives (&quot;tale&quot; with one letter missing; i.e., unfinished)
*&quot;rising smoke&quot; gives (a &quot;cigar&quot; is a &quot;smoke&quot;, and this is a down clue so &quot;rising&quot; indicates that &quot;cigar&quot; should be written up the page; i.e., backwards)
*&quot;about&quot; means that the letters of should be put either side of , giving 
*&quot;(8)&quot; says that the answer is a single word of eight letters.

There are many codewords or &quot;indicators&quot; that have a special meaning in the cryptic crossword context. (In the example above, &quot;about&quot;, &quot;unfinished&quot; and &quot;rising&quot; all fall into this category). Learning these, or being able to spot them, is a useful and necessary part of becoming a skilled cryptic crossword solver.

Compilers or setters often use slang terms and abbreviations, generally without indication, so familiarity with these is important for the solver. Abbreviations may be as simple as &quot;west&quot; = &quot;W&quot;, &quot;New York&quot; = &quot;NY&quot;, but may also be more difficult. Words that can mean more than one thing are commonly exploited; often the meaning the solver must use is completely different from the one it appears to have in the clue. Some examples are:

* &quot;Bloomer&quot; – often means flower (a thing that blooms).
* &quot;Flower&quot; – often means river (a thing that flows).
* &quot;Runner&quot; – also often river (a thing that runs to the sea)
* &quot;Lead&quot; – could be the metal, an electric cable, or the verb.
* &quot;Nice&quot; – if capitalized as the first word, could either be &#x27;amiable&#x27; or the French city. Thus &quot;Nice friend&quot; often clues the letters &quot;ami&quot;.
* &quot;Novel&quot; – could be a book, or a word for new, or a codeword indicating an anagram.
* &quot;Permit&quot; – could be a noun (meaning license) or a verb (meaning allow).

Of these examples, &quot;flower&quot; is an invented meaning (using the verb &quot;flow&quot; and the suffix &quot;-er&quot;), and cannot be confirmed in a standard dictionary. A similar trick is played in the old clue &quot;A wicked thing&quot; for , where the &quot;-ed&quot; suffix must be understood in its &#x27;equipped with&#x27; meaning. In the case of the &#x27;-er&#x27; suffix, this trick could be played with other meanings of the suffix, but except for &quot;river&quot; → (a river is not a &#x27;thing that banks&#x27; but a &#x27;thing that has banks&#x27;), this is rarely done.

Sometimes &quot;compiler&quot;, or the name or codename of the compiler (if visible by the crossword), codes for some form of the first-person pronoun (&quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, &quot;my&quot;, &quot;mine&quot;).

In the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; back page, Monday 15 March 2017, 7 down, is &quot;Banish spirits with zero ice upsetting imbibing times (8)&quot;; the answer is : it means &quot;banish spirits&quot;, and is rearranged, including (described as &quot;times&quot;). The word &quot;upsetting&quot; indicates an anagram and the word &quot;imbibing&quot; indicates an insertion.

== Grids for cryptic crosswords ==

A typical cryptic crossword grid is generally 15×15, with half-turn rotational symmetry. Unlike typical American crosswords, in which every square is almost always &quot;checked&quot; (that is, each square provides a letter for both an across and a down answer), only about half of the squares in a cryptic crossword are checked.

In most daily newspaper cryptic crosswords, grid designs are restricted to a set of stock grids. In the past this was because hot metal typesetting meant that new grids were expensive.

Some papers have additional grid rules. In &quot;The Times&quot;, for example, all words have at least half the letters checked, and although words can have two unchecked squares in succession, they cannot be the first two or last two letters of a word. The grid shown here breaks one &quot;Times&quot; grid rule: the 15-letter words at 9 and 24 across each have 8 letters unchecked out of 15. &quot;The Independent&quot; allows setters to use their own grid designs.

&quot;Variety&quot; (UK: &#x27;advanced&#x27;) cryptic crosswords typically use a &quot;barred grid&quot; with no black squares and a slightly smaller size; 12×12 is typical. Word boundaries are denoted by thick lines called &quot;bars&quot;. In these variety puzzles, one or more clues may require modification to fit into the grid, such as dropping or adding a letter, or being anagrammed to fit other, unmodified clues; un-clued spaces may spell out a secret message appropriate for the puzzle theme once the puzzle is fully solved. The solver also may need to determine where answers fit into the grid.

A July 2006 &quot;Puzzlecraft&quot; section in &quot;Games&quot; magazine on cryptic crossword construction noted that for cryptic crosswords to be readily solvable, no fewer than half the letters for every word should be checked by another word for a standard cryptic crossword, while nearly every letter should be checked for a variety cryptic crossword. In most UK advanced (&#x27;variety&#x27;) cryptics, at least three-quarters of the letters in each word are checked.

== Regional variation ==

=== British and North American differences ===
There are notable differences between British and North American (including Canadian) cryptics. American cryptics are thought of as holding to a more rigid set of construction rules than British ones. American cryptics usually require all words in a clue to be used in service of the wordplay or definition, whereas British ones allow for more extraneous or supporting words. In American cryptics, a clue is only allowed to have one subsidiary indication, but in British cryptics the occasional clue may have more than one; e.g., a &quot;triple definition&quot; clue would be considered an amusing variation in the UK but unsound in the US.

=== Other languages ===

For the most part, cryptic crosswords are an English-language phenomenon, although similar puzzles are popular in a Hebrew form in Israel (where they are called &quot;tashbetsey higayon&quot; (תשבצי הגיון) &quot;Logic crosswords&quot;) and (as &quot;Cryptogram&quot;) in Dutch. In Poland similar crosswords are called &quot;Hetman crosswords&quot;. &#x27;Hetman&#x27;, a senior commander, and also the name for a queen in Chess, emphasises their importance over other crosswords. In Finnish, this type of crossword puzzle is known as &quot;piilosana&quot; (literally &quot;hidden word&quot;), while &quot;krypto&quot; refers to a crossword puzzle where the letters have been coded as numbers. The German &quot;ZEITmagazin&quot; has a weekly cryptic crossword called &quot;Um die Ecke gedacht&quot; and the &quot;SZ Magazin&quot; features &quot;das Kreuz mit den Worten&quot;.

In India the Telugu publication Sakshi carries a &quot;Tenglish&quot; (Telugu-English, bilingual) cryptic crossword; the Prajavani and Vijaya Karnataka crossword (Kannada) also employs cryptic wordplay. Enthusiasts have also created cryptic crosswords in Hindi. Since 1994, &quot;enigmista&quot; has challenged Italians annually with &quot;Il cruciverba più difficile del mondo&quot; (The World&#x27;s Most Difficult Crossword), which has many features in common with English-style cryptics.

In Chinese something similar is the riddle of Chinese characters, where partial characters instead of substrings are clued and combined.

== Types of cryptic clues ==
Clues given to the solver are based on various forms of wordplay. Nearly every clue has two non-overlapping parts to it: one part that provides an unmodified but often indirect definition for the word or phrase, and a second part that includes the wordplay involved. In a few cases, the two definitions are one and the same, as often in the case of &quot;&amp;lit.&quot; clues. Most cryptic crosswords provide the number of letters in the answer, or in the case of phrases, a series of numbers to denote the letters in each word: &quot;cryptic crossword&quot; would be clued with &quot;(7,9)&quot; following the clue. More advanced puzzles may drop this portion of the clue.

=== Anagrams ===

An anagram is a rearrangement of a certain section of the clue to form the answer. This is usually indicated by a codeword which indicates change, movement, breakage or something otherwise amiss. One example:

:&quot;Chaperone shredded corset (6)&quot;

gives , which means &quot;chaperone&quot; and is an anagram, indicated by the word &quot;shredded&quot;, of .

Anagram clues are characterized by the codeword (the &quot;anagram indicator&quot; or – among enthusiasts – &quot;anagrind&quot;) placed adjacent to a word or phrase made up of the letters to be rearranged (the &quot;anagram fodder&quot;). The indicator tells the solver an anagram exists, and the fodder provides the anagram to be solved. Indicators can come either directly before or directly after the fodder.

In an American cryptic, only the words given in the clue may be anagrammed; in some older puzzles, the words to be anagrammed may be clued and &quot;then&quot; anagrammed. This kind of clue is called an &quot;indirect anagram&quot;. For example, in:

:&quot;Chew honeydew fruit (5)&quot;

&quot;chew&quot; is the indicator, but &quot;honeydew&quot; does not directly provide the letters to be anagrammed. Instead, &quot;honeydew&quot; clues , which can be rearranged to form the solution – another &quot;fruit&quot;. Indirect anagrams are not used in the vast majority of cryptic crosswords, ever since they were criticised by Ximenes in &quot;On the Art of the Crossword&quot;.

It is common for the setter to use a juxtaposition of indicator and fodder that together form a common phrase, to make the clue appear as normal as possible. For example:

:&quot;Lap dancing friend (3)&quot;

uses &quot;dancing&quot; as the indicator because it combines naturally with the fodder , disguising the anagram. The solution is (&quot;friend&quot;).

=== Charade ===
In a &quot;charade&quot; or &quot;Ikea clue&quot;, the answer is formed by joining individually clued words to make a larger word (namely, the answer).

For example:

:&quot;Outlaw leader managing money (7)&quot;

The answer is , formed by for &quot;outlaw&quot; and for &quot;leader&quot;. The definition is &quot;managing money&quot;. With this example, the words appear in the same order in the clue as they do in the answer, and no special words are needed to indicate this. However, the order of the parts is sometimes indicated with words such as &quot;against&quot;, &quot;after&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;with&quot; or &quot;above&quot; (in a down clue).

=== Containers ===
A &quot;container&quot; or &quot;insertion&quot; clue puts one set of letters inside another. So:

:&quot;Apostle&#x27;s friend outside of university (4)&quot;

gives (&quot;apostle&quot;), by placing (&quot;friend&quot;) outside of (&quot;university&quot;).

A similar example:

:&quot;Utter nothing when there&#x27;s wickedness about (5)&quot;

The answer is (&quot;utter&quot;), formed by placing (&quot;nothing&quot;) inside the word (&quot;wickedness&quot;).

Other container or insertion indicators are &quot;inside&quot;, &quot;over&quot;, &quot;around&quot;, &quot;about&quot;, &quot;clutching&quot;, &quot;enters&quot;, and the like.

=== Deletions ===
Deletion is a wordplay mechanism which removes some letters of a word to create a shorter word. Deletions consist of &quot;beheadments&quot;, &quot;curtailments&quot;, and &quot;internal deletions&quot;. In beheadments, a word loses its first letter. In curtailments, it loses its last letter, and internal deletions remove an inner letter, such as the middle one.

An example of a beheadment:

:&quot;Beheaded celebrity is sailor (3)&quot;

The answer would be , another word for &quot;sailor&quot;, which is &quot;star&quot; (&quot;celebrity&quot;) without the first letter (&quot;beheaded&quot;).

A similar example, but with a specification as to the letter being removed:

:&quot;Bird is cowardly, about to fly away (5)&quot;

The answer is , which means &quot;bird&quot; and is &quot;craven&quot;, or &quot;cowardly&quot;, without the first letter (in this case &quot;C&quot;, the abbreviation for &quot;circa&quot; or &quot;about&quot;).

Other indicators of beheadment include &quot;don&#x27;t start&quot;, &quot;topless&quot;, and &quot;after the first&quot;.

An example of curtailment:

:&quot;Shout, &quot;Read!&quot; endlessly (3)&quot;

The answer is (a &quot;shout&quot;). If you ignore the punctuation, a &quot;read&quot; is a book, and &quot;book&quot; without its final letter (&quot;endlessly&quot;) is the solution.

Other indicators of curtailment include &quot;nearly&quot; and &quot;unfinished&quot;.

An example of internal deletion:

:&quot;Challenging sweetheart heartlessly (6)&quot;

The answer is , which means &quot;challenging&quot;, and is &quot;darling&quot; without its middle letter, or &quot;heartlessly&quot;.

=== Double definition ===
A clue may, rather than having a definition part and a wordplay part, have two definition parts. Thus:

: &quot;Not seeing window covering (5)&quot;

would have the answer , because &quot;blind&quot; can mean both &quot;not seeing&quot; and &quot;window covering&quot;. Note that since these definitions come from the same root word, an American magazine might not allow this clue. American double definitions tend to require both parts to come from different roots, as in this clue:

: &quot;Eastern European buff (6)&quot;

This takes advantage of the two very different meanings (and pronunciations) of , the one with the long &quot;o&quot; sound meaning &#x27;someone from Poland&#x27;, and the one with the short &quot;o&quot; sound meaning &#x27;make shiny&#x27;.

These clues tend to be short; in particular, two-word clues are almost always double-definition clues.

In the UK, multiple definitions are occasionally used; e.g.:

: &quot;Blue swallow feathers fell from above (4)&quot;

is a quintuple definition of (&quot;blue&quot; (sad), &quot;swallow&quot; (drink), &quot;feathers&quot; (plumage), &quot;fell&quot; (cut down) and &quot;from above&quot;), but in the US this would be considered unsound.

Some British newspapers have an affection for quirky clues of this kind where the two definitions are similar:

: &quot;Let in or let on (5)&quot; – 

Note that these clues do not have clear indicator words.

=== Hidden words ===
In &quot;hidden words&quot;, &quot;embedded words&quot; or &quot;telescopic&quot; clues, the solution itself is written within the clue – either as part of a longer word or across more than one word. For example:

:&quot;Found ermine, deer hides damaged (10)&quot;

gives , which means (cryptically at least) &quot;damaged&quot; and appears across &quot;Found ermine deer&quot; (as indicated by &quot;hides&quot;).

Possible indicators of a hidden clue include &quot;in part&quot;, &quot;partially&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, &quot;within&quot;, &quot;hides&quot;, &quot;conceals&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, and &quot;held by&quot;.

Another example:

:&quot;Introduction to do-gooder canine (3)&quot;

gives , which is the first part of, or &quot;introduction to&quot;, the word &quot;do-gooder&quot;, and means &quot;canine&quot;.

The opposite of a hidden word clue, where letters &quot;missing&quot; from a sentence have to be found, is known as a Printer&#x27;s Devilry, and appears in some advanced cryptics.

There are several common variations on hidden word clues:

==== Initial or final letters ====
The first or last letters of part of the clue are put together to give the answer.

An example of an initialism:

:&quot;Initially amiable person eats primate (3)&quot;

The answer would be , which is a type of &quot;primate&quot;. &quot;Initially&quot; signals that you must take the first letters of &quot;amiable person eats&quot;.

Another example would be:

:&quot;At first, actor needing new identity emulates orphan in musical theatre (5)&quot;

The answer would be , the name of a famous &quot;orphan in musical theatre&quot;. This is obtained from the first letters of &quot;actor needing new identity emulates&quot;.

Words that indicate initialisms also include &quot;firstly&quot;, &quot;primarily&quot; and &quot;to start&quot;.

It is possible to have initialisms just for certain parts of the clue. It is also possible to employ the same technique to the end of words. For example:

:&quot;Old country lady went round Head Office initially before end of day (7)&quot;

The answer would be , which used to be a kingdom in Africa (an &quot;old country&quot;). Here, we take the first letters of only the words &quot;Head Office&quot; () and we take the &quot;end of&quot; the word &quot;day&quot; (). The letters of the word , meaning &quot;lady&quot;, are then made to go around the letters to form .

That the solver should use the last letters may also be indicated by such words as &quot;ends&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;, &quot;last&quot; etc. For instance:

:&quot;Bird with tips of rich aqua, yellow, black (4)&quot;

Would be (a &quot;bird&quot;) based on the letters at the ends of (&quot;tips of&quot;) &quot;rich aqua, yellow, black&quot;.

==== Odd or even letters ====
Either the odd or even letters of words in the clue give the answer. An example is:

:&quot;Odd stuff of Mr. Waugh is set for someone wanting women to vote (10)&quot;

The answer would be , which is &quot;someone wanting women to vote&quot;. The word &quot;odd&quot; indicates that we must take only the odd-indexed letters of the rest of the clue (&quot;stuff of Mr. Waugh is set&quot;), i.e. every other letter beginning with the first.

=== Homophones ===
Homophones are words that sound the same but have different meanings, such as &quot;night&quot; and &quot;knight&quot;. Homophone clues always have an indicator word or phrase that has to do with being spoken or heard. Examples of homophone indicators include &quot;reportedly&quot;, &quot;they say&quot;, &quot;utterly&quot; (here treated as &quot;utter(ing)-ly&quot; and not with its usual meaning), &quot;vocal&quot;, &quot;to the audience&quot;, &quot;auditioned&quot;, &quot;by the sound of it&quot;, &quot;is heard&quot;, &quot;in conversation&quot; and &quot;on the radio&quot;. &quot;Broadcast&quot; is a particularly devious indicator as it could indicate either a homophone or an anagram.

An example of a homophone clue is

:&quot;We hear twins shave (4)&quot;

which is a clue for , which means &quot;shave&quot; and is a homophone of &quot;pair&quot;, or &quot;twins&quot;. The homophone is indicated by &quot;we hear&quot;.

If the two homophones are the same length, the clue should be phrased in such a way that only one of them can be the answer. This is usually done by having the indicator adjacent to the word that is not the definition; therefore, in the previous example, &quot;we hear&quot; was adjacent to &quot;twins&quot; and the answer must therefore be rather than . The indicator could come between the homophones if they were of different lengths and the enumeration was given, such as in the case of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;rite&quot;.

=== Letter banks ===
The letter bank form of cluing consists of a shorter word (or words) containing no repeated letters (an &quot;isogram&quot;), and a longer word or phrase built by using each of these letters (but no others) at least once but repeating them as often as necessary. This type of clue has been described by American constructors Joshua Kosman and Henri Picciotto, who write the weekly puzzle for &quot;The Nation&quot;. The shorter word is typically at least three or four letters in length, while the target word or phrase is at least three letters longer than the bank word. For example, the four letters in the word can be used as a bank to form the word . Typically, the clue contains indicator words such as &quot;use,&quot; &quot;take,&quot; or &quot;implement&quot; to signal that a letter bank is being employed.

A more complicated example of a letter bank is:

: &quot;Composer taking and retaking ingredients of Advil? Not! (7,7)&quot;

In this case, &quot;taking and retaking ingredients&quot; signals that the letters of both and form a letter bank. Those letters yield a &quot;composer&quot;, and the solution, .

Kosman and Picciotto consider this to be a newer and more complicated form of cluing that offers another way, besides the anagram, of mixing and recombining letters.

=== Reversals ===
A word that gets turned around to make another is a reversal. For example:

:&quot;Returned beer fit for a king (5)&quot;

The answer is . (&quot;beer&quot;) is reversed (&quot;returned&quot;) to yield the solution (&quot;fit for a king&quot;).

Other indicator words include &quot;receding&quot;, &quot;in the mirror&quot;, &quot;going the wrong way&quot;, &quot;returns&quot;, &quot;reverses&quot; &quot;to the left&quot; or &quot;left&quot; (for across clues), and &quot;rising&quot;, &quot;overturned&quot; or &quot;mounted&quot; or &quot;comes up&quot; (for down clues).

=== Cryptic definition ===
Here the clue appears to say one thing, but with a slight shift of viewpoint it says another. For example:

:&quot;Flower of London?&quot; (6)

gives , a flow-er of London. Here, the surface reading suggests a blossom, which disguises the fact that the name of a river is required. Notice the question mark: this is often (though by no means always) used by compilers to indicate this sort of clue is one where you need to interpret the words in a different fashion. The way that a clue reads as an ordinary sentence is called its &quot;surface reading&quot; and is often used to disguise the need for a different interpretation of the clue&#x27;s component words.

This type of clue is common in British and Canadian cryptics but is generally unused in American cryptics; in American-style crosswords, . It&#x27;s almost certainly the oldest kind of cryptic clue: cryptic definitions appeared in the UK newspaper puzzles in the late 1920s and early 1930s that mixed cryptic and plain definition clues and evolved into fully cryptic crosswords.

=== Spoonerism ===
A relatively uncommon clue type, a Spoonerism is a play on words where corresponding consonant clusters are switched between two words in a phrase (or syllables in a word) and the switch forms another pair of proper &quot;sounding&quot; words. For example: &quot;butterfly&quot; = &quot;flutter by&quot;.

Both the solution word or phrase and its corresponding Spoonerism are clued for, and the clue type is almost always indicated by reference to William Archibald Spooner himself – with some regions/publications insisting his religious title &quot;Rev.&quot; or &quot;Reverend&quot; be included. In contrast to all other clue types, this makes them almost impossible to disguise. But that does not necessarily make them easy.

An example of a Spoonerism clue is:

:&quot;He will casually put down Spooner&#x27;s angry bear (9)&quot;

The answer is (&quot;he will casually put down&quot;). The Spoonerism is &quot;bitter lug&quot;, i.e. &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;bear&quot; (as in carry).

The vast majority of Spoonerism clues swap the first consonants of words or syllables, but Spoonerisms are not strictly restricted to that form and some setters will take advantage of this. John Henderson (Enigmatist in the Guardian) once clued for using the Spoonerism , which did not sit well with many solvers.

=== Palindrome ===
A clue in which the only hint to the letters in the solution is that it is a Palindrome, for example:

:&quot;To and fro action (4)&quot;

where the answer is or:

:&quot;She&#x27;s a lady, whichever way you look at it! (5)&quot;

where the answer is .

=== Reverse anagrams ===
A &quot;reverse anagram&quot; or &quot;revenge&quot; clue (short for &quot;reverse engineer&quot;) is one which gives an anagrammed word in its text, and the solver has to determine the anagrammed word(s) and indicator that make the solution matching the definition. Such clues may or may not use an indicator.

An example from &quot;The Guardian:&quot;

:&quot;Innovative way to make dog run? (6-8)&quot;

The phrase &quot;way to make&quot; indicates that the solver should look for a word and anagram indicator that could rearrange to the words ; the solution, meaning &quot;innovative,&quot; is .

Revenge clues are not limited to anagrams; for instance, &quot;Quickly grab containers for the setter? (4,2)&quot; indicates a revenge reversal of , or (&quot;quickly grab&quot;).

=== &amp;lit. ===
An &quot;&amp;lit.&quot;, &quot;literal&quot; or &quot;all-in-one&quot; clue is one where the entire clue simultaneously provides both the definition and the wordplay. &quot;&amp;lit.&quot; stands for &quot;and literally so&quot;, and originates from Derrick Somerset Macnutt (known by his pen name Ximenes), who defined it as meaning: &quot;This clue both indicates the letters or parts of the required word, in one of the ways already explained in this book, and can also be read, , literally, as an indication of the meaning of the whole word, whether as a straight or as a veiled definition.&quot; In some publications, particularly in the United States, &amp;lit clues are indicated by an exclamation mark at the end of the clue.

For example:

:&quot;God incarnate, essentially! (4)&quot;

The answer is . The Norse god Odin is hidden in &quot;God incarnate&quot;, as clued by &quot;essentially&quot;, but the definition of Odin is also the whole clue, as Odin is essentially a God incarnate.

Another example:

:&quot;Spoil vote! (4)&quot;

would give the answer . In the cryptic sense, &quot;spoil&quot; indicates an anagram of . Simultaneously, the whole clue is – with a certain amount of licence allowed to crossword setters – a definition.

Another example:

:&quot;E.g., origin of goose (3)&quot;

gives the answer . A goose is an example of something that finds its origin in an egg, so the whole clue gives a definition. The clue can also be broken down cryptically: &quot;E.g.&quot; loses its full stops to give , followed by the first letter of (i.e. the &quot;origin of&quot;) the word &quot;goose&quot;, .

====Semi-&amp;lit.====

A &quot;semi-&amp;lit.&quot; clue is a variant of the &amp;lit. where the entire clue still provides the definition, but the wordplay is only given by part of the clue.

For example:

:&quot;Dressed up to hear a bit of Puccini? This may be part of it (5,3)&quot;

gives . The whole clue provides a definition of the answer (i.e. something that might be worn while listening to Puccini), but only the first part of the clue is wordplay (&quot;bit of Puccini&quot; cluing , and &quot;dressed up&quot; clueing an anagram; overall an anagram of ).

Another example:

:&quot;Dog in wild? Yes! (5)&quot;

gives . Only the first part of the clue provides wordplay (&quot;wild&quot; indicating an anagram of ), but the whole clue can be interpreted as a definition of the answer.

The term &quot;clue-as-definition&quot; (CAD) can be used as an inclusive descriptor covering both &amp;lit. and semi-&amp;lit. clues.

=== Other miscellaneous types ===
Ximenes identifies various other types of clue in &quot;On The Art Of The Crossword&quot; (1966) in chapter VII, &#x27;Improvised Clues&#x27;, including:

* &quot;Heads and tails&quot;, involving words which have lost their first or last letter, similar to deletions; e.g. &quot;Hard workers have a limit: one exam unfinished (8)&quot;, solution: (, where is &quot;test&quot; missing its last letter).
* &quot;Peculiarities of speech&quot;, involving words as pronounced by someone with a distinct accent (e.g. Cockney speakers dropping an initial &quot;H&quot;) or even illness/speech pathology (e.g. words pronounced as if by someone with a blocked nose, lisp or stutter); e.g. &quot;Arry&#x27;s pronunciation of dame?&quot;, solution: .
* &quot;Words treated as parts of other words&quot;; e.g. &quot;A lifter causes swearing (four letters first) (5)&quot;, solution: , which would become &quot;affidavit&quot; if four letters were added to the start.
* &quot;Foreign languages&quot;, involving non-English words as solutions; e.g. &quot;English writer, but understood by all Frenchmen (4)&quot;, solution: .
* &quot;Literary references&quot;, involving references to books; e.g. &quot;Procedures followed by Romans (4)&quot;, solution: .
* &quot;Outsides&quot;, the converse of a hidden word clue; e.g. &quot;Cavalrymen disheartened in Normandy (4)&quot;, solution: .

Initial or final letter clues are also mentioned in this chapter, to be used &quot;When the setter is in real desperation&quot;.

== Clueing techniques ==

=== Combination clues ===
&quot;Combination clues&quot; employ more than one method of wordplay; this is particularly common for longer grid entries. For example:

:&quot;Illustrious baron returns in pit (9)&quot;

The answer is . &quot;Baron&quot; is reversed (or &quot;returns&quot;) to yield , and put inside (or &quot;pit&quot;) to give the solution (clued by &quot;illustrious&quot;).

In this example, the clue uses a combination of Reversal and Hidden clue types:

:&quot;Cruel to turn part of Internet torrid (6)&quot;

The answer to this clue is . &quot;To turn&quot; indicates a reversal, and &quot;part of&quot; suggests a piece of &quot;Internet torrid&quot;; the solution means &quot;cruel&quot;.

=== Misleading clues ===

To make clues more difficult, cryptic constructors will frequently use traditional indicator words in a misleading manner.

*A cryptic crossword on the back page of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; on 14 March 2012 included the answer , whose clue was &quot;Close study of broken nails, say (8)&quot; (&quot;Say&quot; often indicates a homophone, or means &#x27;for example&#x27;, but here it is part of an anagram.)
* &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; back page, 8 November 2012: &quot;Drunk compiler&#x27;s admitted boob (5)&quot; is parsed as &quot;means &#x27;drunk&#x27;, contains , has 5 letters&quot;, which yields . (&quot;Drunk&quot; often indicates an anagram, but here serves as the definition.)
* In a crossword by &quot;Araucaria&quot;, &quot;Araucaria is&quot; coded for (&quot;I am&quot;) as part of an answer.

=== Clues valid only on particular days or in particular areas ===
* A cryptic crossword in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; on Easter Sunday 2014 had an anagram clue whose answer was , and its definition part was &quot;today&quot;.
* &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; on 8 April 2019, page 30: 5 down: &quot;Parade one month ago (5,4)&quot;: its answer was ; that clue would be valid only in April each year.
* In a cryptic crossword in the British newspaper &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; (20 April 2017), the clue &quot;&quot;Irritating proverb we&#x27;re told (4)&quot; ( = &quot;&quot;) depends on a homophony which only happens in non-rhotic pronunciation such as in British English.

== Bits and pieces ==
Abbreviations are popular with crossword compilers for cluing individual letters or short sections of the answer. Consider this clue:

:&quot;About to come between little Desmond and worker for discourse (7)&quot;

There are two abbreviations used here. &quot;About&quot; is abbreviated (for &quot;circa&quot;), and &quot;little Desmond&quot; indicates that the diminutive of Desmond (namely, ) is required. The is &quot;to come between&quot; and (a worker; note that compilers also use &quot;worker&quot; to stand for &#x27;bee&#x27; or &#x27;hand&#x27;), giving , which means &quot;discourse&quot;.

Compilers use many of these crossword abbreviations.

Another type of abbreviation in clues might be words that refer to letters. For example, &#x27;you&#x27; refers to the letter U, &#x27;why&#x27; refers to the letter Y, etc. A clue for instance:

:&quot;For example, why didn&#x27;t you put the country? (5)&quot;

The answer is . Three abbreviations are used here. &quot;For example&quot; clues the common abbreviation (for &quot;exempli gratia&quot;). &quot;Why&quot; clues the letter . The phrase &quot;didn&#x27;t you put&quot; clues the letters (the word &quot;you&quot; refers to the letter &quot;U&quot;, and word &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot; indicates that this should be left out of the word &quot;put&quot;). Adding these together gets &quot;the country&quot;.

There are many ways in which constructors can clue a part of a clue. In this clue:

:&quot;Exclamation of surprise about spectacles, from the top (3)&quot;

The word &quot;spectacles&quot; clues because these letters look like a pair of spectacles &quot;from the top&quot;. The answer is thus , which is an &quot;exclamation of surprise&quot; with coming from &quot;circa&quot;, clued by &quot;about&quot;.

Often, Roman numerals are used to break down words into their component letter groups. E.g. In this clue:

:&quot;A team&#x27;s first supporter is pivotal (4)&quot;

The answer is , and the direct meaning is conveyed by the words &quot;is pivotal&quot;. The first is followed by , which is 11 in Roman numerals (referring to the number of players on the field in a cricket or soccer &quot;team&quot;). &quot;First supporter&quot; refers to the letter , which is the first letter of the word &quot;supporter&quot;.

== Clueing technique and difficulty ==
Cryptic clue styles across newspapers are ostensibly similar, but there are technical differences which result in the work of setters being regarded as either Ximenean or Libertarian (and often a combination of both).

Ximenean rules are very precise in terms of grammar and syntax, especially as regards the indicators used for various methods of wordplay. Libertarian setters may use devices which &quot;more or less&quot; get the message across. For example, when treating the answer the setter may decide to split the word into and and, after finding suitable ways to define the answer and , now looks to give the solver a clue to the letter . Ximenean rules would not allow something like &quot;reach first&quot; to indicate that is the first letter of &quot;reach&quot; because, grammatically, that is not what &quot;reach first&quot; implies. Instead, a phrase along the lines of &quot;first to reach&quot; would be needed as this conforms to rules of grammar. Many Libertarian crossword editors would, however, accept &quot;reach first&quot; as it would be considered to reasonably get the idea across. For instance, a clue following Ximenean rules for ( + ) may look as such:
:&quot;Stinger first to reach drink (4)&quot;
While a clue following Libertarian rules may look as follows:
:&quot;Stinger reaches first drink (4)&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; is perhaps the most Libertarian of cryptic crosswords, while &quot;The Times&quot; is mostly Ximenean. The others tend to be somewhere in between; the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and &quot;Independent&quot; tend towards Ximenean, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; also – although its Toughie crossword can take a very Libertarian approach depending on the setter. None of the major daily cryptics in the UK is &quot;strictly Ximenean&quot;; all allow clues which are just cryptic definitions, and strict Ximenean rules exclude such clues. There are other differences like nounal anagram indicators and in current &quot;Times&quot; crosswords, unindicated definition by example: &quot;bay&quot; in the clue indicating in the answer, without a qualification like &quot;bay, perhaps&quot;.

In terms of difficulty, Libertarian clues can seem impenetrable to inexperienced solvers. However, more significant is the setter him/herself. Crosswords in the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; are published anonymously, so the crossword editor ensures that clues adhere to a consistent house style. Inevitably each setter has an individual (and often very recognisable) approach to clue-writing, but the way in which wordplay devices are used and indicated is kept within a defined set of rules.

In the &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Financial Times&quot; and &quot;Telegraph&quot; Toughie series the setters&#x27; pseudonyms are published, so solvers become familiar with the styles of individual setters rather than house rules. Thus the level of difficulty is associated with the setter rather than the newspaper, though puzzles by individual setters can actually vary in difficulty considerably.

It is effectively impossible, then, to describe one newspaper&#x27;s crosswords as the toughest or easiest. For newcomers to cryptic puzzles the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; is often regarded as an ideal starting point, but this is contentious. Since all of the newspapers have different styles, concentrating on one of them is likely to lead to proficiency in only one style of clue-writing; moving to a different series, after perhaps years spent with just one, can leave the solver feeling as if they have gone back to square one. The better technique is to simply attempt as many different crosswords as possible, perhaps to find a &quot;comfort zone&quot; but, more importantly, to experience the widest possible range of Ximenean/Libertarian styles.

==Variety Cryptics==

&quot;Themed&quot; or &quot;variety&quot; cryptics have developed a small but enthusiastic following in Britain, the United States, and elsewhere. Variety cryptics are arguably among the most difficult of all crossword puzzles, both to compile and to solve, since they often involve alterations to the answers before entry into the grid, meaning that there is no assurance that the cross clues will match up unless properly altered.

As an example, a puzzle entitled &quot;Trash Talk&quot; by Bob Stigger in the June 2019 issue of the U.S. publication &quot;Games World of Puzzles&quot; included the following instruction:

In this variety cryptic crossword, 18 clue answers are garbage, to be treated according to the mantra &quot;13-Across 6-Across and 40-across.&quot; Specifically, six answers are too long for the grid; delete one letter. Six others are too short, double one letter. And six more don&#x27;t match the crossing letters; anagram them. 

==Pangrams==
A crossword that includes all the letters of the alphabet within the clue answers is known as a pangram. Crosswords have been set with clue answers that contain all the letters of the alphabet twice, thrice, four times over, and even five times. This last, a pentapangram, was compiled by Maize and published in the &quot;i&quot; on January 1, 2018. 

== Cryptic crosswords in specific publications ==

=== United Kingdom ===
In Britain it is traditional—dating from the cryptic crossword pioneer Edward (Bill) Powys Mathers (1892–1939), who called himself &quot;Torquemada&quot; after the Spanish Inquisitor—for compilers to use evocative pseudonyms. &quot;Crispa&quot;, named from the Latin for &quot;curly-headed&quot;, who set crosswords for the &quot;Guardian&quot; from 1954 until her retirement in 2004, legally changed her surname to &quot;Crisp&quot; after divorcing in the 1970s. Some pseudonyms have obvious connotations: for example, Torquemada as already described, or &quot;Mephisto&quot; with fairly obvious devilish overtones. Others are chosen for logical but less obvious reasons, though &quot;Dinmutz&quot; (the late Bert Danher in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;) was produced by random selection of Scrabble tiles.

;&quot;The Daily Telegraph/Sunday Telegraph&quot;
:The &quot;Telegraph&quot;, like the &quot;Times&quot;, does not identify the setter of each puzzle but, unlike the &quot;Times&quot;, has a regular setter for each day of the week, plus a few occasional setters to cover holidays or sickness. Regular setters include John Halpern, Ray Terrell, Jeremy Mutch, Don Manley, Allan Smith, Steve Bartlett and Richard Palmer. The regular setters as of 1 November 2006 are shown in a photograph here. The crossword editor is Chris Lancaster, who took over from Phil McNeill in early 2018. There is an advanced cryptic called Enigmatic Variations in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, and also a 15×15 blocked-grid puzzle.

:In September 2008 the &quot;Telegraph&quot; started printing a &#x27;Toughie&#x27; crossword as well as the daily puzzle, from Tuesday to Friday. This is described by the paper as &quot;the toughest crossword in Fleet Street&quot; or similar and does include the setter&#x27;s pseudonym. Comments from some solvers on these puzzles don&#x27;t always agree with this assessment, rating maybe half of them as close to average broadsheet cryptic difficulty.

;&quot;The Guardian&quot;
:Notable compilers of &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s cryptic crosswords include Enigmatist, Pasquale, Paul (John Halpern), Rufus (now retired), and the late Bob Smithies (Bunthorne) and Araucaria. The puzzle is edited by Alan Connor.

;&quot;The Independent&quot;
:&quot;The Independent&quot; went online only in 2016, but still has a cryptic crossword. Setters include Virgilius, Dac, Phi, Quixote, Nimrod, Monk, Nestor, Bannsider, Anax, Merlin, Mass, Math, Morph, Scorpion, Tees and Punk (John Halpern). The daily puzzle is edited by Eimi (Mike Hutchinson).

;&quot;i&quot;
:The &quot;i&quot; newspaper was launched in 2010 as a sister paper to The Independent, but was bought by Johnston Press in February 2016 when The Independent moved to digital-only publication. The fiendish Inquisitor puzzle is edited by John Henderson whose predecessor was the late former &quot;Times&quot; crossword editor Mike Laws. The crosswords are often themed and may contain a Nina: a hidden feature.

;&quot;The National&quot;
:Launched in Scotland as &quot;The Newspaper that supports an independent Scotland&quot; on 24 November 2014 after the independence referendum on 18 September. The National has a daily cryptic crossword after a request from readers to include one. The National is the only daily pro-independence newspaper in Scotland and is edited by Sunday Herald editor Richard Walker.

;&quot;The Observer&quot;
:Home of the famous Azed crossword, which employs a barred grid and a wider vocabulary than standard cryptics, and in conjunction with its predecessors &#x27;Torquemada&#x27; and &#x27;Ximenes&#x27; is the longest-running series of barred-grid puzzles. On the first Sunday of every month and at Christmas, Azed runs a clue-writing competition, via which many of today&#x27;s top compilers have learnt their trade. &quot;The Observer&quot; also features a standard cryptic crossword, the Everyman, compiled by Allan Scott.

;&quot;Private Eye&quot;
:In the early 1970s the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; had a crossword set by the Labour MP Tom Driberg, under the pseudonym of &quot;Tiresias&quot; (supposedly &quot;a distinguished academic churchman&quot;). It is currently set by Eddie James under the name &quot;Cyclops&quot;. This crossword is usually topical, and contains material varying from risqué to rude, in clues, answers and the solver&#x27;s head; much of the rudeness is by innuendo. It also often includes references to the content of the rest of the magazine, or its jargon in which, for example, the current monarch of the UK is &quot;Brian&quot; and the last one &quot;Brenda&quot;. The £100 prize for the first correct solution opened is unusually high for a crossword and attracts many entrants.

;&quot;The Radio Times&quot;
:Roger Prebble has compiled the cryptic crossword since 1999.

;&quot;Significance&quot;
:&quot;Significance&quot; is a joint publication between the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statistical Society; it contains a cryptic crossword in its puzzle section. The magazine offers a randomly awarded $150 or £100 to spend on Wiley books for those that submit a correct entry.

;&quot;The Spectator&quot;
:Cryptics in the weekly &quot;Spectator&quot; often have a specific theme, such as a tribute to a public figure who has died recently or a historic event that has its anniversary this week. As in most British periodicals, the cryptic in the &quot;Spectator&quot; is numbered: in the &quot;Spectator&quot;&#x27;s case, a puzzle&#x27;s theme may be related to its specific number (such as a historic event that occurred in the year corresponding to the four-digit number of the puzzle for that week). Compilers include Doc (the puzzle editor as well as chief setter), Dumpynose (an anagram for &#x27;Pseudonym&#x27;) and Columba.

;&quot;The Sunday Times&quot;
:&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; cryptic crossword is compiled in rotation by three setters: Jeff Pearce, Dean Mayer and David McLean, the latter taking over from Tim Moorey in January 2016. (Mr Moorey&#x27;s final puzzle included the hidden message &#x27;Farewell from Tim&#x27;; he continues to set Mephisto puzzles.) The position of puzzles editor is now held by Peter Biddlecombe. Until her retirement in December 2010, Barbara Hall was puzzles editor for 32 years, and wrote about half the paper&#x27;s cryptic crosswords. The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; is also home to the difficult barred-grid Mephisto puzzle, currently set in rotation by Don Manley, Paul McKenna and Tim Moorey. Previous Mephisto setters were Richard Kilner (only setter, 1959 to 1973), Richard Whitelegg (only setter, 1973 to 1995), Chris Feetenby (1995-2008) and Mike Laws (1995-2011).

;&quot;The Times&quot;
:Adrian Bell was the first to set The &quot;Times&quot; crossword from 1930 and was one of those responsible for establishing its distinctive cryptic style. (The &quot;Times&quot; was a relatively late adopter: the &quot;Telegraph&quot; crossword started in 1925, and the &quot;Guardian&quot; in 1929.) The &quot;Times&quot; has a team of about 15 setters, many of whom set puzzles for other papers. The setter of each puzzle is not identified. The &quot;Times&quot; also has &quot;jumbo&quot; (23×23) puzzles in the Saturday edition and since 1991 has provided a home for the famously difficult advanced cryptic puzzle which used to appear in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Listener&quot;.

:The daily &quot;Times&quot; puzzle is syndicated in the &quot;New York Post&quot; (US) and &quot;The Australian&quot; (Aus) papers. In both cases, the puzzle appears some weeks after it appeared in &quot;The Times&quot;.
:The &quot;Times&quot; introduced the Quick Cryptic crossword on March 24, 2014. It is a smaller and easier version of the paper&#x27;s main daily cryptic crossword, and is designed to be more accessible to beginners and those who want a quicker challenge. The Quick Cryptic is 13x13 squares in size, compared to the main cryptic&#x27;s 15x15, and uses simpler wordplay. It also features semi-anonymous setters, so you can see who created the puzzle but not their real name.

:In October 2007, &quot;The Bugle&quot;—a TimesOnline podcast by John Oliver and Andy Zaltzman—introduced the first, revolutionary &quot;Audio Cryptic Crossword.&quot;

;&quot;Viz&quot; magazine
:Since 2009 the adult comic magazine &quot;Viz&quot; has incorporated a cryptic crossword credited to Anus. This is a collaboration of two setters, one of whom has a minor role in supplying some pre-written clues. In keeping with the comic&#x27;s &quot;top shelf&quot; status the puzzle content is an amalgam of humour and obscenity, although the clueing style retains both Libertarian and Ximenean disciplines.

;&quot;The Age&quot; (Australia)
:(see &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;)

;&quot;The Atlantic&quot; (US)
:&quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine had a long-running variety cryptic crossword, known as the Puzzler, created by Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon beginning in 1977, available only online since March 2006. The final original Puzzler was published in August 2009 for the September issue. An online archive of Puzzlers going back to 1997 is still available.

;&quot;The Browser&quot; (US)
:This online news-aggregator offers a weekly American cryptic to its subscribers.

;&quot;Games World of Puzzles&quot; (US)
:Originally two separate publications, &quot;GAMES&quot; and &quot;World of Puzzles&quot;, the two were merged in 2014 to become &quot;GAMES WORLD OF PUZZLES,&quot; published nine times a year. The publication currently features two basic cryptics and two variety cryptics in each issue. Some other puzzles in the publication include cryptic elements, such as double definition puzzles or hidden word puzzles.

;&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; (Canada)
:&quot;Canada&#x27;s national newspaper&quot; includes a daily cryptic somewhat less difficult than its British cousins. The crossword also comes with another set of &quot;Quick Clues&quot; (American-style) which provide a completely different set of answers. Fraser Simpson compiles the Saturday cryptic; he also used to compile an advanced cryptic in &quot;The Walrus&quot;. Until 2015, once a year on Canada Day, &quot;The Globe&quot; published a large 24×24 bar-diagram cryptic.
The Geraldine News (New Zealand)
:This weekly local paper carries a cryptic once a month. It is compiled by Geraldine resident Jim Walton and titled JW Cryptic Crossword. As at April 2019, Jim had provided 244 cryptic crosswords for the paper.

;&quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; (US)
:This magazine features a monthly variety cryptic by Richard Maltby, Jr., and previously also by E. R. Galli, aimed at advanced solvers.

;&quot;The Hindu&quot; (India)
:&quot;The Hindu&quot; newspaper carries cryptic crosswords in the main paper from Monday to Saturday, and a much tougher Sunday Crossword in the Sunday Magazine supplement. The weekday crosswords are set by setters with the pseudonyms Gridman, Arden, Incognito, Afterdark, Buzzer, Neyartha, Scintillator, xChequer, Lightning, Sunnet, Spinner, Aspartame, Mac, Dr. X, KrisKross, Hypatia among others. In every cycle, a setter publishes a certain number of crosswords allotted to him or her, unlike British papers where things are mostly random. The Sunday Crossword is a syndicated crossword from the UK newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;.

:The first setter of the Monday-Saturday cryptic crosswords was Retired Admiral Ram Dass Katari of the Indian Navy, who took up the task in 1971 at the request of Gopalan Kasturi, then editor of &quot;The Hindu&quot;. The crossword has a regular following, and while &quot;The Hindu&quot; publishes the solutions on the following day, the annotated solution is put up at the website &#x27;The Hindu Crossword Corner&#x27; by a group of solvers on the same day.

;&quot;Irish Times&quot;
:The &quot;Irish Times&quot; originally provided a daily puzzle by &quot;Crosaire&quot; (Derek Crozier), which featured a fairly unorthodox style of clue-writing. The paper continued to run his puzzles after his death in April 2010. The last of Crozier&#x27;s crosswords was published in the &quot;Irish Times&quot; on 22 October 2011. The &quot;Irish Times&quot;&#x27; cryptic crossword is currently set by Crosaire&#x27;s successor Crosheir.

;&quot;The Listener&quot; (New Zealand)
:This weekly magazine includes a cryptic by David Tossman, who took over from RWH (Ruth Hendry) in 1997. RWH had been providing a mixed (some cryptic clues) puzzle since 1940.

;&quot;Lovatts Crosswords&quot;
:Lovatts Crosswords are a range of magazines sold throughout the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Christine Lovatt is the main cryptic compiler, and she has been so for 30 years.

;&quot;The Nation&quot; (US)
:This liberal American political weekly featured a weekly cryptic puzzle from 1947 to 2020. Frank W. Lewis wrote the puzzle from late 1947 until his retirement in late 2009. Lewis developed one of the most recognizably personal styles of cryptic setting, and &quot;The Nation&quot; published book collections of his puzzles. From December 2011, the weekly puzzle was written by Joshua Kosman and Henri Picciotto. Their last cryptic for the magazine was published in March 2020. Kosman and Picciotto continue to offer a weekly cryptic at their website leftfieldcryptics.com.

;&quot;The National Post&quot; (Canada)
:Carries a weekly puzzle by Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon.

;&quot;New York Magazine&quot;
:Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s puzzles for &quot;New York Magazine&quot; have been collected in book form. Sondheim is himself a collector of old-time puzzles and board games.

;&quot;New Yorker&quot;
:For some of the time that this magazine was edited by Tina Brown (1997–1999), it included a small (8×10) barred-grid cryptic crossword, set by a range of American and Canadian setters. These puzzles are also available in a book collection, and were republished online.
:Starting in June of 2021, a new cryptic is published each week on Sunday. It uses the same 8x10 barred-grid. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; stopped publishing cryptic crosswords in March 2024.

;&quot;New York Times&quot;
:Two weeks in every 18, the &quot;variety puzzle&quot; in the Sunday edition is a cryptic crossword, usually by Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon, Richard Silvestri, or Fraser Simpson. One week in 18, it is a &quot;Puns and Anagrams&quot; puzzle, a relic of a 1940s attempt to introduce cryptic puzzles to the US.

;&quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; (Auckland, New Zealand)
:The weekend edition features a cryptic crossword by &quot;Kropotkin&quot; (Rex Benson) in addition to The Observer&#x27;s &#x27;Everyman&#x27;. Rex died in 2019 but older Kropotkins are still published.

;&quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;
:The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; has carried a weekly puzzle by Susannah Sears since 2001.

;&quot;Sydney Daily Telegraph&quot;

== Cryptic crossword research ==
Research into cryptic crossword solving has been comparatively sparse. Several discrete areas have been explored: the cognitive or linguistic challenges posed by cryptic clues; the mechanisms by which the &quot;Aha!&quot; moment is triggered by solving cryptic crossword clues; the use of cryptic crosswords to preserve cognitive flexibility (&quot;use-it-or-lose-it&quot;) in aging populations; and expertise studies into the drivers of high performance and ability in solving cryptics.

Recent expertise studies by Friedlander and Fine, based on a large-scale survey of 805 solvers of all ability (mainly UK-based), suggest that cryptic crossword solvers are generally highly academically able adults whose education and occupations lie predominantly in the area of scientific, mathematical or IT-related fields. This STEM connection increases significantly with level of expertise, particularly for mathematics and IT. The authors suggest that cryptic crossword skill is bound up with code-cracking and problem-solving skills of a logical and quasi-algebraic nature.

Friedlander and Fine also note that solvers are motivated predominantly by &quot;Aha!&quot; moments, and intrinsic rewards such as mental challenge. Solvers voluntarily choose to engage with intellectually and culturally stimulating activities like music, theatre, reading, and the arts in their leisure time, and pursue active musical participation such as singing or playing an instrument at noticeably higher levels than the UK national average. Solving cryptic crossword clues can lead to a succession of &#x27;Aha!&#x27; or &#x27;Penny-Dropping&#x27; Moments which is highly rewarding; Friedlander and Fine suggest that research could take advantage of the range of cryptic crossword devices to explore the mechanics of insight in more depth. Looking at expert cryptic crossword solvers – who speedily overcome the clue misdirection – and comparing them with typical, everyday solvers of equal experience may provide a better understanding of the kind of person who can overcome a solving &#x27;hitch&#x27; more easily, and how they go about it.

== Cryptic crosswords in fiction ==
Cryptic crosswords often appear in British literature, and are particularly popular in murder mysteries, where they are part of the puzzle. The character Inspector Morse created by Colin Dexter is fond of solving cryptic crosswords, and the crosswords often become part of the mystery. Colin Dexter himself set crosswords for &quot;The Oxford Times&quot; for many years and was a national crossword champion. In the short story &quot;The Fascinating Problem of Uncle Meleager&#x27;s Will&quot;, by Dorothy L Sayers, Lord Peter Wimsey solves a crossword in order to solve the mystery, while the solution to Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Curtain&quot; hinges on an &quot;Othello&quot; themed crossword. Ruth Rendell has used the device in her novel &quot;One Across, Two Down&quot;. Among non-crime writers, crosswords often feature in the works of P. G. Wodehouse, and are an important part of the short story &quot;The Truth About George&quot;. Alan Plater&#x27;s 1994 novel Oliver&#x27;s Travels (turned into a BBC television serial of the same name in 1995) centres round crossword solving and the hunt for a missing compiler.
Crosswords feature prominently in the 1945 British romantic drama film &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, scripted by playwright Noël Coward, which is number two in the British Film Institute&#x27;s Top 100 British films. The plot of &quot;The Riddle of the Sphinx&quot;, a 2017 episode of &quot;Inside No. 9&quot;, revolves around the clues and answers to a particular crossword puzzle, which had appeared on the day of the original broadcast in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

<text>A cryptogram is a type of puzzle that consists of a short piece of encrypted text. Generally the cipher used to encrypt the text is simple enough that the cryptogram can be solved by hand. Substitution ciphers where each letter is replaced by a different letter, number, or symbol are frequently used. To solve the puzzle, one must recover the original lettering. Though once used in more serious applications, they are now mainly printed for entertainment in newspapers and magazines.

Other types of classical ciphers are sometimes used to create cryptograms. An example is the book cipher, where a book or article is used to encrypt a message.

==History==
The ciphers used in cryptograms were created not for entertainment purposes, but for real encryption of military or personal secrets.

The first use of the cryptogram for entertainment purposes occurred during the Middle Ages by monks who had spare time for intellectual games. A manuscript found at Bamberg states that Irish visitors to the court of Merfyn Frych ap Gwriad (died 844), king of Gwynedd in Wales, were given a cryptogram which could only be solved by transposing the letters from Latin into Greek. Around the thirteenth century, the English monk Roger Bacon wrote a book in which he listed seven cipher methods, and stated that &quot;a man is crazy who writes a secret in any other way than one which will conceal it from the vulgar.&quot; In the 19th century Edgar Allan Poe helped to popularize cryptograms with many newspaper and magazine articles.

Well-known examples of cryptograms in contemporary culture are the syndicated newspaper puzzles Cryptoquip and Cryptoquote, from King Features. Celebrity Cipher, distributed by Andrew McMeel, is another cipher game in contemporary culture, challenging the player to decrypt quotes from famous personalities. 

A cryptoquip is a specific type of cryptogram that usually comes with a clue or a pun. The solution often involves a humorous or witty phrase.

In a public challenge, writer J.M. Appel announced on September 28, 2014, that the table of contents page of his short story collection, &quot;Scouting for the Reaper&quot;, doubled as a cryptogram, and he pledged an award for the first to solve it.

==Solving a cryptogram==
Cryptograms based on substitution ciphers can often be solved by frequency analysis and by recognizing letter patterns in words, such as one-letter words, which, in English, can only be &quot;i&quot; or &quot;a&quot; (and sometimes &quot;o&quot;). Double letters, apostrophes, and the fact that no letter can substitute for itself in the cipher also offer clues to the solution. Occasionally, cryptogram puzzle makers will start the solver off with a few letters.

A printed code key form (the alphabet with a blank under each letter to fill in the substituted letter) is usually not provided but can be drawn to use as a solving aid if needed. Skilled puzzle solvers should require neither a code key form nor starter clue letters.

==Other crypto puzzles==
While the cryptogram has remained popular, over time other puzzles similar to it have emerged. One of these is the Cryptoquote, which is a famous quote encrypted in the same way as a cryptogram. A more recent version, with a biblical twist, is CodedWord. This puzzle makes the solution available only online, where it provides a short exegesis on the biblical text. A third is the Cryptoquiz. The top of this puzzle has a category (unencrypted), such as &quot;Flowers&quot;. Below this is a list of encrypted words which are related to the stated category. The person must then solve for the entire list to finish the puzzle. Yet another type involves using numbers as they relate to texting to solve the puzzle.

The Zodiac Killer sent four cryptograms to police while he was still active. Despite much research, only two of these have been translated, which was of no help in identifying the serial killer.

Media outlets called her the &quot;Tejano Madonna&quot; for her clothing choices. She also ranks among the most influential Latin artists of all time and is credited for catapulting the Tejano genre into the mainstream market.

The youngest child of the Quintanilla family, she debuted in the music scene as a member of the band Selena y Los Dinos, which also included her elder siblings A.B. Quintanilla and Suzette Quintanilla. In the 1980s, she was often criticized and was refused bookings at venues across Texas for performing Tejano music—a male-dominated music genre. However, her popularity grew after she won the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1987, which she won nine consecutive times. She signed with EMI Latin in 1989 and released her self-titled debut album the same year, while her brother became her principal music producer and songwriter.

Selena released &quot;Entre a Mi Mundo&quot; (1992), which peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Regional Mexican Albums chart for eight consecutive months. The album&#x27;s commercial success led music critics to call it the &quot;breakthrough&quot; recording of her musical career. One of its singles, &quot;Como la Flor&quot;, became one of her most popular signature songs. &quot;Live!&quot; (1993) won Best Mexican/American Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards, becoming the first recording by a female Tejano artist to do so. In 1994, she released &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot;, which became one of the best-selling Latin albums in the United States. It was critically acclaimed as being responsible for Tejano music&#x27;s first marketable era as it became one of the most popular Latin music subgenres at the time.

Selena was shot and killed on March 31, 1995, by Yolanda Saldívar, her friend and the former manager of her Selena Etc. boutiques. Saldívar was cornered by police when she attempted to flee and threatened to kill herself but was convinced to give herself up. She was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison with possible parole after 30 years. Two weeks after Selena&#x27;s death, George W. Bush, then-governor of Texas, declared April 16 as Selena Day in Texas. Her posthumous crossover album, &quot;Dreaming of You&quot; (1995), debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making Selena the first Latin artist to accomplish this feat. In 1997, Warner Bros. released &quot;Selena&quot;, a film about her life and career, which starred a then-unknown Jennifer Lopez as Selena, catapulting Lopez into fame. In 2020, Netflix released &quot;&quot; starring Christian Serratos. Selena has sold around 18 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling female artists in Latin music.

== Life and career ==

=== 1971–1988: Early life and career beginnings ===
Selena Quintanilla was born on April 16, 1971, at Freeport Community Hospital in Freeport, Texas. She was the youngest child of Marcella Ofelia Quintanilla (née Samora), who was Mexican-American with some Cherokee ancestry, and Abraham Quintanilla Jr., a Mexican American former musician. The obstetrician-gynecologist at her birth was future House of Representatives member Ron Paul. Selena was raised as a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. Quintanilla Jr. noticed her musical abilities when she was six years old. He told &quot;People&quot; magazine, &quot;Her timing, her pitch were perfect, I could see it from day one&quot;. In 1980, Quintanilla Jr. opened his first Tex-Mex restaurant in Lake Jackson, Papa Gayo&#x27;s, where Selena and her siblings Abraham III (on bass guitar) and Suzette Quintanilla (on drums) would often perform. The following year, the restaurant was forced to close after a recession caused by the 1980s oil glut. The family declared bankruptcy and were evicted from their home. They settled in Corpus Christi, Texas; Quintanilla Jr. became manager of the newly formed band Selena y Los Dinos and began promoting it. They needed the money and played on street corners, weddings, quinceañeras, and fairs.

As her popularity as a singer grew, the demands of Selena&#x27;s performance and travel schedule began to interfere with her education. Her father took her out of school when she was in the eighth grade. Her teacher Marilyn Greer disapproved of Selena&#x27;s musical career. She threatened to report Quintanilla Jr. to the Texas Board of Education, believing the conditions to which Selena was exposed were inappropriate for a girl her age. Quintanilla Jr. told Greer to &quot;mind her business&quot;. Other teachers expressed their concerns when they noticed how tired Selena appeared when she arrived at school. At seventeen, Selena earned a high school diploma from the American School of Correspondence in Chicago and was also accepted at Louisiana State University. She enrolled at Pacific Western University, taking up business administration as her major subject.

Quintanilla Jr. refurbished an old bus; he named it &quot;Big Bertha&quot; and the family used it as their tour bus. In the first years of touring, the family sang for food and barely had enough money to pay for gasoline. In 1984, Selena recorded her first LP record, &quot;Selena y Los Dinos&quot;, for Freddie Records. Despite wanting to record English-language songs, Selena recorded Tejano music compositions; a male-dominated, Spanish-language genre with German influences of polka, jazz, and country music, popularized by Mexicans living in the United States.

Quintanilla Jr. believed that Selena should record musical compositions related to her heritage. During the recording sessions for the album, Selena had to learn Spanish phonetically with guidance from her father. In 1985, to promote the album, Selena appeared on the &quot;Johnny Canales Show&quot;, a popular Spanish-language radio program, on which she continued to appear for several years. Selena was discovered by musician Rudy Trevino, founder of the Tejano Music Awards, where she won the Female Vocalist of the Year award in 1987 and for nine consecutive years after.

The band was often turned down by Texas music venues because of the members&#x27; ages and because Selena was their lead singer. Her father was often told by promoters that Selena would never be successful because she was a woman in a genre historically dominated by men. By 1988, Selena had released five more LP records; &quot;Alpha&quot; (1986), &quot;Muñequito de Trapo&quot; (1987), &quot;And the Winner Is...&quot; (1987), &quot;Preciosa&quot; (1988), and &quot;Dulce Amor&quot; (1988).

=== 1989–1991: &quot;Selena&quot;, &quot;Ven Conmigo&quot;, and relationship with Chris Pérez ===

José Behar of newly formed label EMI Latin Records, together with the new head of Sony Music Latin, watched Selena perform at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards. Behar was searching for new Latin acts and wanted to sign Selena to EMI&#x27;s label Capitol Records, while Sony Music Latin offered Quintanilla Jr. twice Capitol&#x27;s signing fee. Behar thought he had discovered the &quot;next Gloria Estefan&quot; but his superior called Behar illogical because he had been in South Texas less than a week. Quintanilla Jr. chose EMI Latin&#x27;s offer because of the potential for a crossover album and wanted his children to be the first musicians to sign to the label.

Before Selena began recording for her debut album, Behar and Stephen Finfer requested a crossover album for her. She recorded three English-language compositions for the heads of EMI&#x27;s pop division. Behar and Finfer&#x27;s request for a crossover album was denied and Selena was told she needed a bigger fan base to sell such an album. Behar thought EMI Records and the public did not believe that a Mexican American woman could have &quot;crossover potential&quot; after Charles Koppelman denied the project.

Selena released her self-titled debut album on October 17, 1989. The singer recorded most of the songs at AMEN Studios in San Antonio, Texas; &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; and &quot;My Love&quot; were recorded at Sunrise Studios in Houston. Selena wrote &quot;My Love&quot; and wanted the song to be included on the album. Her brother A.B., became Selena&#x27;s principal record producer and songwriter for most of her musical career, though did not write the tracks &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;, &quot;Contigo Quiero Estar&quot;, and &quot;No Te Vayas&quot;. &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; was originally recorded in Japanese in the 1960s by Kyu Sakamoto; Selena used a translation into Spanish of an English version of the song by Janice Marie Johnson. &quot;Selena&quot; peaked at number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Regional Mexican Albums chart, becoming Selena&#x27;s first recording to debut on a national music chart. The album performed better than other recordings from other contemporaneous female Tejano singers.

In the same year, Coca-Cola wanted Selena to become one of their spokespeople in Texas. The jingle used in her first two commercials for the company was composed by A.B. and Chris Pérez—the latter of whom had joined Selena y Los Dinos several months earlier as the band&#x27;s new guitarist. Pérez began having romantic feelings for Selena, despite having a girlfriend in San Antonio. After a trip down to Mexico with the band, Pérez thought it would be best for them both to distance themselves, but he found that impossible and chose to try to build a relationship with her. They expressed their feelings for each other at a Pizza Hut restaurant and shortly afterward became a couple. Pérez and Selena hid their relationship, fearing Quintanilla Jr. would try to break it up.

Selena released her second studio album, &quot;Ven Conmigo&quot;, in September 1990. Three tracks from &quot;Ven Conmigo&quot; were released as singles; &quot;Ya Ves&quot;, &quot;La Tracalera&quot;, and &quot;Baila Esta Cumbia&quot;. The latter, a Tejano cumbia song, became one of Selena&#x27;s most successful singles. Its popularity grew in Mexico, where a compilation album bearing the single&#x27;s name was released there, which was certified platinum by the Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON), denoting sales of 150,000 units.

A registered nurse and fan named Yolanda Saldívar asked Quintanilla Jr. to start a fan club in San Antonio. Saldívar had the idea after she had attended one of Selena&#x27;s concerts. Quintanilla Jr. approved Saldívar&#x27;s request; he believed the fan club would bring more exposure for the band. Saldívar soon became a close friend to Selena and the family; she was trusted and became the acting president of the fan club in 1991. That same year, Salvadoran singer Álvaro Torres composed a duet he wanted to record with Selena. The song, &quot;Buenos Amigos&quot;, was produced by Enrique Elizondo and was released on Torres&#x27; tenth studio album &quot;Nada Se Compara Contigo&quot; (1991).

&quot;Buenos Amigos&quot; peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Songs chart, giving Selena her first number-one single. The song&#x27;s music video earned Selena and Torres two nominations at the 1992 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. The track was also nominated for Duo of the Year at the 1992 Tejano Music Awards. Biographer Deborah Parédez wrote that the track enabled Selena to tour the west and east coasts of the United States. According to John Lannert of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, &quot;Buenos Amigos&quot; was helped by increased airplay on regional Mexican and Tejano radio stations, which had previously dismissed Selena&#x27;s recordings.

=== 1992–1993: Elopement, &quot;Entre a Mi Mundo&quot;, and &quot;Selena Live&quot; ===

Selena&#x27;s sister Suzette claimed to have caught Selena and Pérez flirting with each other and immediately informed their father. Quintanilla Jr. took Pérez off the bus and told him his relationship with Selena was over. Selena and Pérez continued their relationship despite Quintanilla Jr&#x27;s disapproval; Selena&#x27;s mother Marcella approved of their relationship. Quintanilla Jr. saw Selena and Pérez romantically together on the bus after he informed them of his disapproval; he pulled over and an argument between him and Selena ensued. He called Pérez a &quot;cancer in my family&quot; and threatened to disband the group if they continued their relationship.

Selena and Pérez relented; Quintanilla Jr. fired Pérez from the band and prevented Selena from leaving with him. After his dismissal, Pérez and Selena secretly continued their relationship. On the morning of April 2, 1992, Selena and Pérez decided to elope, believing Quintanilla Jr. would never approve of their relationship. Selena thought her father would have to accept them if they were married and would not have to hide their feelings for each other. Within hours of their marriage, the media announced the couple&#x27;s elopement.

Selena&#x27;s family tried to find her; Quintanilla Jr. did not take the news well and alienated himself for some time. Selena and Pérez moved into an apartment in Corpus Christi. In interviews, Quintanilla Jr. expressed how he feared Pérez could be a &quot;machista&quot; (Spanish for a male chauvinist), who would force Selena to end her career and music goals, a move that prevented Quintanilla Jr. to accept Pérez as being suitable for Selena at the time. Quintanilla Jr. later approached Pérez, apologized, accepted the marriage, and took Pérez back into the band.

A month after her elopement, Selena released her third studio album, &quot;Entre a Mi Mundo&quot;, in May 1992. The album was critically acclaimed as her &quot;breakthrough album&quot;. The recording peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Regional Mexican Albums chart for eight consecutive months; it was certified 10× platinum by the RIAA for sales of 600,000 album-equivalent units, while in Mexico, the album sold 385,000 units. &quot;Entre a Mi Mundo&quot; became the first Tejano album by a female artist to sell over 300,000 copies.

Selena was booked for a high-profile border press tour in Monterrey, Mexico, with music media figures in a meet-and-greet conference. At the time, Tejanos were looked down on as &quot;hayseed pochos&quot; among Mexican citizens. The singer&#x27;s Spanish was far from fluent; EMI Latin executives were &quot;terrified&quot; about the singer&#x27;s limited Spanish during the press conference for the album in Mexico. According to Patoski, Selena &quot;played her cards right&quot; during the conference and won over the Mexican media after newspapers hailed her as &quot;an artist of the people&quot;. The newspapers found her to be a refreshing change from Mexican telenovela actors &quot;who were fair-skinned, blond-haired, and green-eyed.&quot;

After her publicity press, Selena was booked to play at several concerts throughout Mexico, including a performance at Festival Acapulco in May 1993, which garnered her critical acclaim. Her performance in Nuevo León on September 17, 1993, was attended by 70,000 people, garnering her the title of the biggest Tejano act in Mexico. The album produced four singles; &quot;Como la Flor&quot;, &quot;¿Qué Creías?&quot;, &quot;La Carcacha&quot;, and &quot;Amame&quot;. &quot;Como la Flor&quot; became Selena&#x27;s signature recording; it was critically acclaimed by music critics as a career launcher for Selena.

&quot;Como la Flor&quot; helped Selena to dominate the Latin music charts and become immensely popular in Mexico—where Mexican-Americans were generally not liked among citizens—which was well received by critics. The track was nominated for Song of the Year at the 1993 Tejano Music Awards. The single peaked at number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Songs chart. In 1994, &quot;Entre a Mi Mundo&quot; ranked as the second best-selling regional Mexican album of all-time.

Selena released &quot;Live!&quot; a year after &quot;Entre a Mi Mundo&quot;; it was recorded during a free concert at the Memorial Coliseum in Corpus Christi, on February 7, 1993. The album included previously released tracks that were sung live and three studio recordings; &quot;No Debes Jugar&quot;, &quot;La Llamada&quot;, and &quot;Tú Robaste Mi Corazón&quot;—a duet with Tejano musician Emilio Navaira. The tracks &quot;No Debes Jugar&quot; and &quot;La Llamada&quot; peaked within the top five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Songs chart. &quot;Live!&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Mexican/American Album at the 36th Grammy Awards.

In May 1994, &quot;Live!&quot; was named Album of the Year by the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards. At the 1994 Tejano Music Awards, &quot;Live!&quot; won Album of the Year, while at the 1994 Lo Nuestro Awards, it was nominated for Regional Mexican Album of the Year. &quot;Live!&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA for shipments of 500,000 copies, while in Mexico it sold 250,000 units. Selena briefly appeared opposite Erik Estrada in a Mexican telenovela titled &quot;Dos Mujeres, Un Camino&quot;. In 1995 she entered negotiations to star in another telenovela produced by Emilio Larrosa. She appeared in two episodes, which garnered record ratings for the series.

=== 1994–1995: Fashion venture, film debut, and &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; ===

Aside from music, in 1994 Selena began designing and manufacturing a line of clothing; she opened two boutiques called Selena Etc., one in Corpus Christi and the other in San Antonio. Both were equipped with in-house beauty salons. By the end of 1994, Selena Etc. had held two fashion shows to showcase their clothing line. Selena (alongside her band, Selena y Los Dinos) held a concert after Selena Etc.&#x27;s second fashion show on December 3, 1994, at the Hemisfair Arena in San Antonio. She was in negotiations to open more stores in Monterrey, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. Saldívar managed both boutiques after the Quintanilla family were impressed with the way she managed the fan club.

&quot;Hispanic Business&quot; magazine reported that the singer earned over five million dollars from these boutiques. She was ranked among the twentieth-wealthiest Hispanic musicians who grossed the highest income in 1993 and 1994. Selena released her fourth studio album, &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot;, in March 1994. The recording debuted at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums chart and number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Regional Mexican Albums charts. After peaking at number one on the Top Latin Albums, the album remained in the top five for the rest of the year and into early 1995.

&quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; became the second Tejano album to reach year-end sales of 500,000 copies, which had previously only been accomplished by La Mafia. It became one of the best-selling Latin albums in the United States. &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; spawned four number-one singles; the title track, &quot;Bidi Bidi Bom Bom&quot;, &quot;No Me Queda Más&quot;, and &quot;Fotos y Recuerdos&quot;. &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; was among the best selling U.S. albums of 1995, and has been certified 36× platinum by the RIAA for sales of 2.16 million album-equivalent units in the United States. The album was named on Tom Moon&#x27;s list of the &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die: A Listener&#x27;s Life List&quot; (2008).

&quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; popularized Tejano music among a younger and wider audience than at any other time in the genre&#x27;s history. The two singles, &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; and &quot;No Me Queda Más&quot;, were the most successful US Latin singles of 1994 and 1995, respectively. The album&#x27;s commercial success led to a Grammy nomination for Best Mexican/American Album at the 37th Grammy Awards in 1995. It won Record of the Year at the 1995 Tejano Music Awards and Regional/Mexican Album of the Year at the 1995 Lo Nuestro Awards. Selena was named &quot;one of Latin music&#x27;s most successful touring acts&quot; during her &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; tour.

After &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot;″s release, Selena was considered &quot;bigger than Tejano itself&quot;, and broke barriers in the Latin music world. She was called the &quot;Queen of Tejano Music&quot; by many media outlets. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; among the most essential Latin recordings of the past 50 years and included it on its list of the top 100 albums of all-time. In 2017, NPR ranked &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; at number 19 on their list of the 150 greatest albums made by women. Sales of the album and its titular single represented Tejano music&#x27;s first commercial success in Puerto Rico. Selena recorded a duet titled &quot;Donde Quiera Que Estés&quot; with the Barrio Boyzz, which was released on their album of the same name in 1994. The song reached number one on the Top Latin Songs chart, which enabled Selena to tour in New York City, Argentina, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Central America, where she was not well known.

In late 1994, EMI chairman Charles Koppelman decided Selena had achieved her goals in the Spanish-speaking market. He wanted to promote her as an English-language solo pop artist. Selena continued touring while EMI began preparing the crossover album, engaging Grammy Award-winning composers. By the time Selena performed to a record-breaking, sold-out concert at the Houston Astrodome in February 1995, work had already begun on her crossover album. In 1995, she made a cameo appearance in &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot;, which starred Marlon Brando, Johnny Depp, and Faye Dunaway.

== Murder ==

The Quintanilla family appointed Yolanda Saldívar as manager of Selena&#x27;s boutiques in early 1994. Eight months later, Selena signed Saldívar as her registered agent in San Antonio, Texas. After the agreement, Saldívar moved from San Antonio to Corpus Christi to be closer to Selena. In December 1994, the boutiques began to suffer after the number of staff for both stores had decreased. According to staff members, Saldívar often dismissed employees she disliked. Employees at the stores regularly complained about Saldívar&#x27;s behavior to Selena, who dismissed the claims, believing Saldívar would not negatively impose erratic decisions on Selena&#x27;s fashion venture.

According to Quintanilla Jr., the staff later turned their attention to him and began informing him about Saldívar&#x27;s behavior. Quintanilla Jr. took the claims seriously; he told Selena to &quot;be careful&quot; and said Saldívar might not be a good influence. Selena dismissed her father&#x27;s inquiries because he had often distrusted people in the past. By January 1995, Selena&#x27;s fashion designer Martin Gomez, her cousin Debra Ramirez, and clients had expressed their concerns over Saldívar&#x27;s behavior and management skills. During an interview with Saldívar in 1995, reporters from &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; said her devotion to Selena bordered on obsession.

According to Quintanilla Jr., in January 1995, he began receiving telephone calls from fans who said they had paid for membership in the Selena fan club and had received nothing in return for it, and he began an investigation. Quintanilla Jr. discovered that Saldívar had embezzled more than $30,000 via forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques. Quintanilla Jr. held a meeting with Selena and Suzette on the night of March 9 at Q-Productions to confront Saldívar. Quintanilla Jr. presented Saldívar with the inconsistencies about the disappeared funds. Quintanilla Jr. told her that if she did not provide evidence that disproved his accusations, he would involve the local police. Quintanilla Jr. banned Saldívar from having any contact with Selena. However, Selena did not want to dissolve their friendship; she thought Saldívar was essential to the success of the clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep her close because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax preparation.

In the days before Selena&#x27;s death, Saldívar delayed handing over the bank statements and financial records by saying she had been physically and sexually assaulted in Mexico. Saldívar, along with Selena, appeared at a medical clinic on March 31, 1995, ostensibly to have Saldívar examined for an assault which she claimed happened to her in Monterrey. During that visit, Saldívar was given a brief physical examination by the clinic&#x27;s doctor, but this did not include a gynecological exam specifically done in cases of sexual assault. It was suggested by nurse Carla Anthony that Saldívar needed to have the rape exam in San Antonio for three reasons: Saldívar was a resident of San Antonio, the clinic they were currently at was in Corpus Christi, and the assault occurred in Mexico.

Afterward, Selena again met with Saldívar in her motel room at the Days Inn in Corpus Christi. At the motel, Selena demanded the financial papers. At 11:48 a.m. (CST), Saldívar got a gun from her purse and pointed it at Selena. As Selena attempted to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the right lower shoulder, severing the subclavian artery and causing a severe loss of blood. Critically wounded, Selena ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood. She collapsed on the floor as the clerk called the emergency services, with Saldívar still chasing after her and calling her a &quot;bitch&quot;. Before collapsing, Selena named Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Meanwhile, Saldívar attempted to leave in her pickup truck. She was spotted by a responding police cruiser. She surrendered after a nearly nine-and-a-half-hour standoff with police and the FBI. By that time hundreds of fans had gathered at the scene. Many wept as police took Saldívar away.

Selena was taken to the Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital at 12:00 p.m. (CST). Her pupils were fixed and dilated, there was no evidence of neurological function, she had no vital signs, and was declared clinically brain dead. Dr. Louis Elkins, cardiac surgeon, arrived at Memorial Hospital and said he saw doctors making &quot;heroic efforts&quot; to revive Selena. They were able to establish an &quot;erratic heartbeat&quot; long enough to transfer her to the trauma room, and began blood transfusions in an attempt to re-establish blood circulation after opening Selena&#x27;s chest and finding massive internal bleeding. By the time Elkins arrived, an emergency doctor began &quot;massaging her heart&quot; after it had stopped beating. Elkins reported how all efforts were futile and said had he been the receiving doctor, he would not have made any treatments on Selena. He felt &quot;obligated to continue&quot; after the emergency room doctor made the decision to reanimate the singer. After 50 minutes of surgery, she was pronounced dead from blood loss and cardiac arrest at 1:05 p.m. (CST).

An autopsy was performed on the same day due to the overwhelming media response. It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena&#x27;s upper right back, near her shoulder blade, passed through her chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest. Her official cause of death was described as &quot;exsanguinating internal and external hemorrhage due to perforating gunshot wound&quot; resulting in &quot;massive bleeding&quot;. The internal examination revealed that she had not ingested any type of drug, nor was she pregnant, which was a rumor that began spreading after her death.

=== Funeral ===

On April 1, Bayfront Plaza in Corpus Christi held a vigil which drew 3,000 fans. During the event, it was announced that a public viewing of the casket would be held at the Bayfront Auditorium the following day. Fans lined up for almost . An hour before the doors opened, rumors that the casket was empty began circulating, which prompted the Quintanilla family to have an open-casket viewing. About 30,000 to 40,000 fans passed by Selena&#x27;s casket. More than 78,000 signed a book of condolence. Flowers for the casket viewing were imported from The Netherlands. At the request of Selena&#x27;s family, video and flash photography was banned.

On April 3, 1995, six hundred guests—mostly family members—attended Selena&#x27;s burial at Seaside Memorial Park in Corpus Christi, Texas, which was broadcast live by a Corpus Christi and San Antonio radio station without the consent of her family. A Jehovah&#x27;s Witness minister from Lake Jackson preached in English, quoting Paul the Apostle&#x27;s words in 1 Corinthians 15. Hundreds of people began circling the area in their vehicles. Among the celebrities who attended Selena&#x27;s funeral were Roberto Pulido, Bobby Pulido, David Lee Garza, Navaira, Laura Canales, Elsa Garcia, La Mafia, Ram Herrera, Imagen Latina, and Pete Astudillo. A special mass held the same day at Los Angeles Sports Arena drew a crowd of 4,000.

=== Impact ===
Selena&#x27;s murder had a widespread impact. Reactions to her death were compared to those following the deaths of musicians John Lennon and Elvis Presley and that of U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Major television networks interrupted their regular programming to break the news—Tom Brokaw referred to Selena as &quot;The Mexican Madonna&quot;. Her death was front-page news in &quot;The New York Times&quot; for two days. Many vigils and memorials were held in her honor, and radio stations in Texas played her music non-stop. Her funeral drew 60,000 mourners, many of whom traveled from outside the United States.

The news struck the Hispanic community extremely hard. Many fans traveled thousands of miles to see Selena&#x27;s house and boutiques, and the crime scene. By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form a detour because a line of cars began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas&#x27; houses. Among the celebrities who contacted the Quintanilla family to express their condolences were Gloria Estefan, Celia Cruz, Julio Iglesias, and Madonna. Other celebrities—including Stefani Montiel, Jaime DeAnda (of Los Chamacos), and Shelly Lares—appeared on radio stations to express their thoughts about Selena&#x27;s death.

An issue of &quot;People&quot; magazine was released several days after her murder. Its publishers believed interest would soon wane. They released a commemorative issue within a week when it became clear it was growing. The issue sold nearly a million copies, selling the entire first and second print runs within two weeks. It became a collector&#x27;s item, a first in the history of &quot;People&quot;. Betty Cortina, an editor of &quot;People&quot;, told &quot;Biography&quot; they never had an issue that was completely sold out; &quot;it was unheard of&quot;. In the following months, the company released &quot;People en Español&quot; aimed at the Hispanic market, due to the success of the Selena issue. This was followed by &quot;Newsweek en Espanol&quot; and &quot;Latina&quot; magazine.

A few days later, Howard Stern mocked Selena&#x27;s murder and burial, poked fun at her mourners, and criticized her music. Stern said, &quot;This music does absolutely nothing for me. Alvin and the Chipmunks have more soul ... Spanish people have the worst taste in music. They have no depth.&quot; Stern&#x27;s comments outraged and infuriated the Hispanic community in Texas. Stern&#x27;s sound effects man added gunshots to her music played in the background on his show. A South Texas judge issued a disorderly conduct arrest warrant in his name. &quot;I did it for all the Tejano fans,&quot; Justice of the Peace Eloy Cano said. Free-speech advocates said the warrant was unconstitutional. &quot;It fails the First Amendment test,&quot; said Jay Jacobson, executive director for the Texas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. &quot;It&#x27;s a speech that is protected being a music critic, no matter how harsh, is not grounds for criminal charges.&quot; Stern made an on-air statement, in Spanish, saying his comments were not made to cause &quot;more anguish to her family, friends and those who loved her&quot;. The League of United Latin American Citizens boycotted Stern&#x27;s show, finding his apology unacceptable.

Texas retailers removed any products that were related to Stern, while Sears and McDonald&#x27;s sent a letter stating their disapproval of Stern&#x27;s comments to the media because some fans believed the companies sponsored Stern&#x27;s show. Within a week, on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, Stern and Robin Quivers (his co-host) were asked whether Stern&#x27;s remarks about Selena were acceptable. Quivers decided not to talk about the situation to avoid arguing with Stern. When Linda Ronstadt—a pop singer of Mexican-American heritage—appeared on the show, she and Quivers argued when Ronstadt defended Selena.

On April 12, 1995, two weeks after Selena&#x27;s death, George W. Bush, governor of Texas at the time, declared her birthday, April 16, Selena Day in the state. He said Selena represented &quot;the essence of south Texas culture.&quot; Some European Americans in Texas wrote to the editor of the &quot;Brazosport Facts&quot; during April and May, asking what the big deal was; some were offended that Selena Day fell on Easter. Others said, &quot;Easter is &quot;more&quot; important than Selena Day&quot;, and that they believed people should let Selena rest in peace and continue with their lives. Mexican Americans in Texas wrote vociferously to the newspaper. Some said others were too critical of Selena Day, and should not have responded so rudely.

In October 1995, a Houston jury convicted Saldívar of first-degree murder and she was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years in 2025. Life with the possibility of parole was the maximum prison term allowed in Texas that could be imposed at the time. In 2002, under a judge&#x27;s order, the gun used to kill Selena was destroyed and the pieces were thrown into Corpus Christi Bay. Fans and historians disapproved of the decision to destroy the gun, saying the event was historical and the gun should have been in a museum.

== Artistry ==
Selena possessed a soprano vocal range. During her lifetime, she expressed her love and admiration for Gloria Estefan, who she credited with opening the door for female artists of hispanic descent. Selena&#x27;s other major influences include Madonna, Paula Abdul, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, as well as rock bands such as AC/DC and Kiss. 

In an April 1995 interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Behar said he saw Selena as a &quot;cross between Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston in style, feel, and vocal range&quot;. Although Selena did not write most of her songs, she incorporated R&amp;B, Latin pop, technopop, country and western, and disco into her Tejano music repertoire. Mario Tarradell of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; said that during her music career, Selena &quot;merges Tejano&#x27;s infectious cumbia rhythm with street-savvy R&amp;B, old-school soul, dancehall reggae, sizzling salsa, and trippy, loopy funk&quot;. Selena&#x27;s recordings expressed &quot;love and pain, as well as strength and passion&quot;, according to Charles Tatum. 

She also recorded independently driven, female-empowerment-themed compositions; &quot;Si La Quieres&quot;, &quot;¿Qué Creías?&quot;, &quot;Ya Ves&quot; and &quot;Ya No&quot;, which centered around inappropriate relationships and recovery from domestic violence. Peter Watrous of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Selena&#x27;s voice &quot;sometimes quivered&quot;, and that she &quot;roughed it up a bit&quot;. He continued, &quot;[a]t its best, it had a coolness, a type of unadorned passion&quot;. Ilan Stavans called her music &quot;cursi-melodramatic, cheesy, overemotional, not too far from Juan Gabriel and a relative of Iglesias&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine said her songs &quot;are perky, cheerful rather than soulful&quot;, and that earlier recordings, &quot;with their tinny, Tijuana Brass charts, and keyboards that evoke calliopes are ideal for the fairground or merry-go-round&quot;. Corliss calls Selena&#x27;s singing an &quot;expert mimicry of everything from Édith Piaf&#x27;s melodramatic contralto to the coloratura riffs of Mariah Carey. But the sounds are still lightly Hispanic.&quot;
&quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine called Selena&#x27;s English-language recordings &quot;a blend of urban pop and Latin warmth&quot;. According to &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;, Selena&#x27;s brother modernized her music into a more &quot;funk and hip hop&quot; sound. Selena&#x27;s use of emotive range during her musical career has been praised by critics as being her trademark. A.B. wrote increasingly cumbia-influenced songs for &quot;Ven Conmigo&quot; (1990); Ramiro Burr of &quot;Billboard&quot; said Selena and her band had &quot;evolved a rhythmic style that demonstrated its increasing prowess for catchy cumbias such as &#x27;Baila Esta Cumbia&#x27; and the title track&quot;. Italian essayist Gaetano Prampolini wrote that &quot;Selena&#x27;s voice projected a sonorous warmth and joyfulness&quot; during his review of Selena&#x27;s cumbia recordings. In his review of the remix album &quot;Enamorada de Ti&quot; (2012), Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that Selena&#x27;s songs were &quot;rooted in the &#x27;90s and sound that way&quot;.

== Public image ==
Quintanilla Jr. sought to maintain Selena&#x27;s image clean and family-oriented. In 1989, she was offered sponsorship from beer companies but her father turned them down. Selena was often refused gigs at Tejano venues because she was a female singer in a male-dominated music scene. Manuel Peña wrote that after 1989, Selena&#x27;s popularity increased and she became a sex icon following the release of her debut album. Charles Tatum said Selena drew most attention from her &quot;beauty, sexuality, and youthful impact on the Tejano music scene&quot;.

Selena said she never wanted to record explicit songs because of her upbringing and because her fan base consisted largely of young children, who regarded her as a role model. She further commented on the question of her sexual appeal to men during her crossover attempt, asserting that she will &quot;stay the same&quot; and that her English-language recordings will refrain from foul language and sexual themes. In 1997, María Celeste Arrarás wrote in her book about Selena&#x27;s death that the singer was a &quot;sweet and charismatic girl&quot;. According to Arrarás, Selena &quot;trusted everyone&quot;; she often went shopping alone, despite her father&#x27;s concerns over her safety.

Betty Cortina of &quot;People&quot; magazine said Selena&#x27;s provocative choice of clothing was an acceptable emulation of Janet Jackson and Madonna, and that she wore &quot;sexy outfits that [accentuated] a body of a Latina woman&quot;. Cortina also stated that Selena had a &quot;flamboyant style, an unbelievable body, curves and booty&quot;. Arrarás wrote that Selena &quot;began wearing clothes designed to emphasize her curvaceous figure&quot; and that she &quot;never came across as cheap—simply sexy&quot;. She also said Selena&#x27;s makeup regimen was not being &quot;painted up or vulgar&quot;. Arrarás also noted Selena&#x27;s &quot;fun-loving stage manner&quot; and said she was &quot;playful onstage and off&quot;.

Matt S. Meier wrote in his book &quot;The Mexican American Experience: An Encyclopedia&quot; (2010) that Selena exhibited &quot;contagious energy&quot; during her concerts and said she displayed &quot;warmth, passion, and sexuality&quot; while exuding a &quot;down-to-earth persona of the wholesome young girl next door&quot;. Selena wore outfits that accented her physical attributes and was not afraid to wear outfits she liked, despite criticism from parents who thought Selena&#x27;s choice of outfits were inappropriate for young girls, who began emulating Selena. Her views on public image in the fashion industry were bothersome; she said she was opposed to the image that all woman should be &quot;rail-thin&quot; and the notion that they must wear certain outfits and be &quot;super-young to be beautiful&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Selena began wearing decorative bustiers, spandex or tight pants, and attractive, unbuttoned jackets during her concerts. She was inspired by Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson, and Madonna. During a 1992 interview, Selena said her choice of clothing does not reflect her personality. NBC News called Selena&#x27;s outfit &quot;provocative&quot;. Because of her choices of outfits and dance moves, she was named by her fans as the &quot;Mexican Madonna&quot;. According to Suzette, Selena often designed and sewed her outfits backstage with her designers, moments before she was due on stage. Quintanilla Jr. disapproved of Selena&#x27;s outfits, but he later accepted it when Selena discussed it being a fashion trend.

Selena became an inactive member of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses due to her exotic clothing. During the photo shoot for &quot;Entre a Mi Mundo&quot; (1992), a photographer remarked on the ways Selena&#x27;s choice of clothing affected Quintanilla Jr. tremendously; he often left sessions when Selena appeared in revealing outfits. Selena was credited as the first woman to change public perceptions of feminine beauty in the Tejano market; a feminist, she blazed a trail for other female artists during her career.

Following Selena&#x27;s death, some celebrities questioned her status as a role model among Hispanic women. In her about the singer, filmmaker Lourdes Portillo expressed concerns whether Selena was a great role model for young women. Portillo believed Selena was sending the wrong message to young girls by dancing in clothing that suggested hypersexualization. American author Sandra Cisneros agreed with Portillo&#x27;s assessment that Selena was &quot;not a good role model to Latina women&quot;. Media outlets also shared Portillo&#x27;s views; they said the &quot;fairy tale story&quot; of Selena was one that her family would want to preserve, questioning Quintanilla Jr.&#x27;s role for pushing an image that Selena had &quot;never made mistakes&quot; into the media, calling it &quot;lies&quot; and &quot;not the real story&quot;.

== Philanthropy ==
During her childhood, Selena helped organizations such as Toys for Tots. She was active in the U.S. Latino community, visiting local schools to talk to students about the importance of education. At Fulmore Junior High School in Austin, she educated two hundred high school students about positive attitudes and setting life-goals in their adult lives. Selena urged children to stay in school, and that alcohol and drugs will lead them nowhere in life. She spent her free time helping her community. Selena performed in Washington, D.C. to celebrate the forming of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Following the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, Selena helped victims in Florida by performing at a Houston benefit concert.

In August 1994, Selena hosted a charity baseball game to raise money for unspecified charities. She also donated her time to civic organizations such as D.A.R.E. and planned a fundraising concert to help AIDS patients. Selena participated with the Texas Prevention Partnership which was sponsored by the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Dep Corporation), which released an educational video that was sent to students for free. Her pro-education videos included &quot;My Music&quot; and &quot;Selena Agrees&quot;. She was in the works for a Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America benefit concert.

In January 1995, Selena headlined the Teach the Children festival in San Antonio. The concert funded a non-profit program to provide school supplies to needy children. Selena was a spokesperson for women in abusive relationships. She also helped out at homeless shelters. According to the A&amp;E television series &quot;Biography&quot;, Selena&#x27;s fans were often minorities; she encouraged them to make the most of their lives.

== Legacy ==
Selena has been credited for helping redefine Latin music and its subgenres of Tejano, cumbia, and Latin pop. Selena broke barriers in the Latin music world. She is considered &quot;one of the most significant Mexican-American singers of the end of the twentieth century&quot;. &quot;People&quot; magazine named Selena one of the most intriguing people of the 20th century. US Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison named Selena one of &quot;the spirited women who shaped [the United States].&quot;

Selena became one of the &quot;most celebrated cultural products&quot; of the United States-Mexico borderlands. Selena was called the &quot;Queen of Tejano Music&quot;, and was described as &quot;the most important and popular Tejano star of all time&quot;. Her death was &quot;the most devastating loss&quot; in Tejano music history, according to Zach Quaintance of &quot;The Monitor&quot;. At the time of her death, Selena became one of the most widely known Mexican-American vocal artists and the most popular Latin artist in the United States. She had a &quot;cult-like&quot; following among Hispanics.

Selena has been named one of the most influential Latin artists of all-time and has been credited for elevating a music genre into the mainstream market. &quot;Latin Post&quot; called the singer &quot;one of the most iconic artists in Latin American music history&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her &quot;arguably the most important Latina musician in the country, on her way to becoming one of the most important, period.&quot; Selena became a household name in the United States and Mexico following her death and became part of the American pop culture. She became more popular in death than when she was alive.

After her death, her popularity among the Hispanic population was compared to those of Marilyn Monroe and Madonna in Anglo-American culture. According to author Carlota Caulfield, Selena was &quot;one of the most popular Latina singers of the 1990s&quot;. Selena&#x27;s popularity was drawn in by the LGBT community and minority groups in the United States. The popularity of Tejano music waned after her death and has not recovered. John Lannert of &quot;Billboard&quot; said in an interview with &quot;Biography&quot; in 2007 that when Selena died the &quot;Tejano market died with her&quot;.

&quot;Dreaming of You&quot;, the crossover album Selena had been working on at the time of her death, was released in July 1995. It sold 175,000 copies on the day of its release in the U.S.—a then-record for a female vocalist—and sold 331,000 copies its first week. Selena became the third female artist to sell over 300,000 units in one week, after Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey. It debuted at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, becoming the first album by a Hispanic artist to do so. &quot;Dreaming of You&quot; helped Selena to become the first solo artist to debut a posthumous album at number one. &quot;Dreaming of You&quot; joined five of Selena&#x27;s studio albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart simultaneously, making Selena the first female artist in &quot;Billboard&quot; history to do so. The album was certified 59× platinum (Latin field), for sales of 3.54 million album-equivalent units in the U.S. alone.

 it has sold over 2.942 million copies in the U.S. making it the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the country according to Nielsen SoundScan. , the recording has sold five million copies worldwide. In 2008, Joey Guerra of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said its lead single, &quot;I Could Fall in Love&quot;, had &quot;made the Tejano goddess a posthumous crossover star&quot;. Her death was believed to have sparked an interest in Latin music by people who were unaware of its existence. It was also believed her death &quot;open[ed] the doors&quot; to other Latin musicians such as Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, and Shakira.

In 1995, the United States Social Security Administration ranked the name Selena one of the 100 most popular names for newborn girls, and namesake Selena Gomez acknowledged Quintanilla&#x27;s influence. In December 1999, Selena was named the &quot;top Latin artist of the &#x27;90s&quot; and &quot;Best selling Latin artist of the decade&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot; for her fourteen top-ten singles in the Top Latin Songs chart, including seven number-one hits. She was the best-selling Latin female singer of the 1990s in the U.S. and Mexico. Selena was named &quot;Best Female Vocalist of the &#x27;80s&quot; and &quot;Best Female Vocalist of the &#x27;90s&quot; at the 2010 Tejano Music Awards. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Selena at number 89 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

=== Posthumous film, streaming video and honors ===
In the months following her death, several honors and tributes were erected. Several proposals were made, such as renaming streets, public parks, food products, and auditoriums. Two months later, a tribute was held at the 1995 Lo Nuestro Awards. The Spirit of Hope Award was created in Selena&#x27;s honor in 1996; it was awarded to Latin artists who participated in humanitarian and civic causes. On March 16, 2011, the United States Postal Service released a &quot;Latin Legends&quot; memorial stamp to honor Selena, Carlos Gardel, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, and Carmen Miranda. In February 2014, the Albany, New York &quot;Times Union&quot; named her one of &quot;100 Coolest Americans in History&quot;. In 1998 Selena was commemorated with a museum.

In 1995, Selena was inducted into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Hall of Fame, the Hard Rock Cafe&#x27;s Hall of Fame, and the South Texas Music Hall of Fame. In 2001 she was inducted into the Tejano Music Hall of Fame. In 2017, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The unveiling ceremony of her star was attended by around 4,500 fans, which was the largest-ever crowd for an unveiling ceremony at the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was named one of the 20 most influential Texans of all time by author Laurie Jasinski. She was ranked fifth of the &quot;100 most influential Latin musicians of the 20th century&quot; according to the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;. The singer has been given many epithets by media outlets, including the &quot;Queen of Cumbia&quot; or &quot;Queen of Kumbia&quot;, the &quot;Chicana Elvis&quot;, the &quot;Queen of Hybrid Pop Culture&quot;, the &quot;Hispanic Marilyn Monroe&quot;, the &quot;Tupac Shakur of Latin Music&quot;, the &quot;Corpus Christi Queen&quot;, and the &quot;People&#x27;s Princess&quot;. Media have compared Selena&#x27;s fashion sense to that of Madonna more times than any other celebrity.

In 1995, Mexican actress Salma Hayek was chosen to portray Selena in a biopic produced by the Quintanilla family and Warner Bros. However, Hayek turned down the role as she felt it was &quot;too early&quot; to base a film on Selena, and that it would be emotional since Selena&#x27;s death was still being covered on American television. Over 21,000 people auditioned for the title role, becoming the second largest audition since the search for Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). Puerto Rican-American actress Jennifer Lopez replaced Hayek, which initially drew criticism because of Lopez&#x27;s Puerto Rican ancestry, but after seeing her performance, fans changed their views. Gregory Nava directed the film, which was released on March 21, 1997. &quot;Selena&quot; opened in 1,850 theaters worldwide and grossed $11,615,722, making it the second-highest-grossing film debut that week. With a production budget of $20 million, the film grossed $35 million in the U.S. The film was a commercial and critical success and is often cited by critics as Lopez&#x27;s breakthrough role. Lopez rose into pop culture, for which the film&#x27;s success was credited.

In 1999, a Broadway-bound musical titled &quot;Selena&quot; was scheduled to premiere in San Antonio in March 2000 to commemorate the fifth anniversary of her murder. Broadway producers Tom Quinn, Jerry Frankel, Peter Fitzgerald, and Michael Vega staged the musical, and Edward Gallardo wrote the show&#x27;s book and lyrics. Fernando Rivas composed the show&#x27;s songs. In 2000, &quot;Selena Forever&quot; was first produced; the show embarked on a 30-city U.S. tour with a budget of over US$2 million. After a national casting call, producers chose Veronica Vasquez to portray Selena; Vasquez alternated in the role with Rebecca Valdez. The musical previewed on March 21, and opened on March 23 at the San Antonio Municipal Auditorium.

Selena&#x27;s family and her former band, Los Dinos, held a tribute concert on April 7, 2005, a week after the 10th anniversary of her murder. The concert, titled &quot;Selena ¡VIVE!&quot;, was broadcast live on Univision and achieved a 35.9 household rating. It was the highest-rated and most-viewed Spanish-language television special in the history of American television. The special was also the number-one program in any language among adults ages 18 to 34 in Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco; it tied for first in New York, beating that night&#x27;s episode of Fox&#x27;s reality show &quot;American Idol&quot;. Among Hispanic viewers, &quot;Selena ¡VIVE!&quot; outperformed Super Bowl XLV and the telenovela &quot;Soy tu dueña&quot; during the &quot;most-watched NFL season ever among Hispanics&quot;.

In January 2015, it was announced that a two-day annual event called Fiesta de la Flor would be held in Corpus Christi for Selena by the Corpus Christi Visitors Bureau. Musical acts for the first annual event included Kumbia All Starz, Chris Pérez, Los Lobos, Jay Perez, Little Joe y la Familia, Los Palominos, Stefani Montiel of Las 3 Divas, Girl in a Coma&#x27;s Nina Diaz, Las Fenix, and &quot;The Voice&quot; contestant Clarissa Serna. The event raised $13 million with an attendance of 52,000 people, 72% of whom lived outside of Corpus Christi. The event sparked interest from people in 35 states and five different countries including Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador.

On August 30, 2016, a wax statue of Selena was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Hollywood. In October 2016, MAC Cosmetics released a limited edition Selena makeup line after &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot; senior producer Patty Rodriguez started a petition for the company to do so and it garnering over 37,000 signatures. It became the best-selling celebrity line in cosmetic history. She was inducted into the Texas Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame at Texas Woman&#x27;s University in October 2016. An exhibit at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. that ran in 2017, focused on Selena&#x27;s influence in marketing. &quot;Due to her massive appeal to both general and Latino markets, advertisers began targeting specific demographics for the first time.&quot;

Google honored Selena on October 17, 2017, with a musical doodle of her life. On December 11, 2018, it was announced that a biographical television series based on Selena&#x27;s life titled &quot;&quot; would be released on Netflix in December 2020. Actress Christian Serratos plays the leading role as Selena, which was shown in a teaser trailer in late 2019. The two-part series is being done with the participation of the Quintanilla family. &quot;&quot; is an American biographical drama streaming television series created by Moisés Zamora and starring Christian Serratos. The first part of the series was released on Netflix on December 4, 2020. The second and final part premiered on May 4, 2021.

In a 10-part podcast miniseries, &quot;Anything for Selena&quot;, broadcast in 2021 by WBUR-FM and Futuro Media, Latina journalist Maria Garcia &quot;goes on an intimate, revelatory quest to understand how Selena has become a potent symbol for tensions around race, class and body politics in the United States&quot;. In the same year, Selena was posthumously presented with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award which her family received on the artist&#x27;s behalf.

Selena was posthumously awarded a 2023 National Medal of Arts, which was accepted by her sister in a ceremony held in October 2024.

=== Monuments ===

Mirador de la Flor () is Selena&#x27;s own life-size bronze statue monument in Corpus Christi, Texas, sculpted by H. W. &quot;Buddy&quot; Tatum and unveiled in 1997. About 30,000 people from around the world visit this monument every year. While the monument has remained a popular tourist attraction, the construction of the statue met some resistance from the local community. Dusty Durrill, a local philanthropist, financed the construction of the monument with support from local community leaders.

<text>The Statue of Zeus at Olympia was a giant seated figure, about tall, made by the Greek sculptor Phidias around 435 BC at the sanctuary of Olympia, Greece, and erected in the Temple of Zeus there. Zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules as king of the gods on Mount Olympus.

The statue was a chryselephantine sculpture of ivory plates and gold panels on a wooden framework. Zeus sat on a painted cedarwood throne ornamented with ebony, ivory, gold, and precious stones. It was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. 

The statue was lost and destroyed before the end of the 6th century AD, with conflicting accounts of the date and circumstances. Details of its form are known only from ancient Greek descriptions and representations on coins and art.

==History==
The statue of Zeus was commissioned by the Eleans, custodians of the Olympic Games, in the latter half of the fifth century BC for their newly constructed Temple of Zeus. Seeking to outdo their Athenian rivals, the Eleans employed sculptor Phidias, who had previously made the massive statue of Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon.

The statue occupied half the width of the aisle of the temple built to house it. The geographer Strabo noted early in the 1st century BC that the statue gave &quot;the impression that if Zeus arose and stood erect he would unroof the temple.&quot; The &quot;Zeus&quot; was a chryselephantine sculpture, made with ivory and gold panels on a wooden substructure. No copy in marble or bronze has survived, though there are recognizable but only approximate versions on coins of nearby Elis and on Roman coins and engraved gems.

The 2nd-century AD geographer and traveler Pausanias left a detailed description: the statue was crowned with a sculpted wreath of olive sprays and wore a gilded robe made from glass and carved with animals and lilies. Its right hand held a small chryselephantine statue of crowned Nike, goddess of victory; its left a scepter inlaid with many metals, supporting an eagle. The throne featured painted figures and wrought images and was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony, and ivory. Zeus&#x27; golden sandals rested upon a footstool decorated with an Amazonomachy in relief. The passage underneath the throne was restricted by painted screens.

Pausanias also recounts that the statue was kept constantly coated with olive oil to counter the harmful effect on the ivory caused by the &quot;marshiness&quot; of the Altis grove. The floor in front of the image was paved with black tiles and surrounded by a raised rim of marble to contain the oil. This reservoir acted as a reflecting pool which doubled the apparent height of the statue.

According to the Roman historian Livy, the Roman general Aemilius Paullus (the victor over Macedon) saw the statue and &quot;was moved to his soul, as if he had seen the god in person&quot;, while the 1st-centuryAD Greek orator Dio Chrysostom declared that a single glimpse of the statue would make a man forget all his earthly troubles.
According to Strabo, when Phidias was asked about the model he would use for his Zeus, he answered that he would portray Zeus according to these words of Homer:
The sculptor also was reputed to have immortalised Pantarkes, the winner of the boys&#x27; wrestling event at the eighty-sixth Olympiad who was said to have been his &quot;beloved&quot; (), by carving (&quot;Pantarkes is beautiful&quot;) into Zeus&#x27;s little finger, and by placing a relief of the boy crowning himself at the feet of the statue.

According to Pausanias, &quot;when the image was quite finished Pheidias prayed the god to show by a sign whether the work was to his liking. Immediately, runs the legend, a thunderbolt fell on that part of the floor where down to the present day the bronze jar stood to cover the place.&quot;

==Loss and destruction==
According to Roman historian Suetonius, the Roman Emperor Caligula gave orders that &quot;such statues of the gods as were especially famous for their sanctity or their artistic merit, including that of Jupiter at Olympia, should be brought from Greece, in order to remove their heads and put his own in their place.&quot; The emperor was assassinated before this could happen, in 41 AD; his death was supposedly foretold by the statue, which &quot;suddenly uttered such a peal of laughter that the scaffolding collapsed and the workmen took to their heels.&quot;

In 391 AD, the Christian Roman emperor Theodosius I banned participation in pagan cults and closed the temples. The sanctuary at Olympia fell into disuse. The circumstances of the statue&#x27;s eventual destruction are unknown. The 11th-century Byzantine historian Georgios Kedrenos records a tradition that it was carried off to Constantinople, where it was destroyed in the great fire of the Palace of Lausus, in 475 AD. 

Alternatively, the statue perished along with the temple, which was severely damaged by fire in 425 AD. But earlier loss or damage is implied by Lucian of Samosata in the later 2nd century, who referenced it in &quot;Timon&quot;: &quot;they have laid hands on your person at Olympia, my lord High-Thunderer, and you had not the energy to wake the dogs or call in the neighbours; surely they might have come to the rescue and caught the fellows before they had finished packing up the loot.&quot;
==Phidias&#x27; workshop==
The approximate date of the statue (the third quarter of the 5th century BC) was confirmed in the rediscovery (1954–1958) of Phidias&#x27; workshop, approximately where Pausanias said the statue of Zeus was constructed. Archaeological finds included tools for working gold and ivory, ivory chippings, precious stones and terracotta moulds. Most of the latter were used to create glass plaques, and to form the statue&#x27;s robe from sheets of glass, naturalistically draped and folded, then gilded. A cup inscribed &quot;ΦΕΙΔΙΟΥ ΕΙΜΙ&quot; or &quot;I belong to Phidias&quot; was found at the site. However, the inscription is considered by some to be a forgery.

<doc id="69798" wikidata="Q45368" url="?curid=69798" title="Mausoleum at Halicarnassus">
<text>The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus or Tomb of Mausolus (; ) was a tomb built between 353 and 351 BC in Halicarnassus (present Bodrum, Turkey) for Mausolus, an Anatolian from Caria and a satrap in the Achaemenid Persian Empire, and his sister-wife Artemisia II of Caria. The structure was designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythius of Priene. Its elevated tomb structure is derived from the tombs of neighbouring Lycia, a territory Mausolus had invaded and annexed , such as the Nereid Monument.

The Mausoleum was approximately in height, and the four sides were adorned with sculptural reliefs, each created by one of four Greek sculptors: Leochares, Bryaxis, Scopas of Paros, and Timotheus. The Mausoleum contained 400 freestanding sculptures. The mausoleum was considered to be such an aesthetic triumph that Antipater of Sidon identified it as one of his Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was destroyed by successive earthquakes from the 12th to the 15th century; it was the last surviving of the six destroyed wonders.

The word &quot;mausoleum&quot; has now come to be used generically for an above-ground tomb.

==Conquest==
In the 4th century BC, Halicarnassus was the capital of the small regional kingdom of Caria, within the Achaemenid Empire on the western coast of Asia Minor.

In 377 BC, the nominal ruler of the region, Hecatomnus of Milas, died and left control of the kingdom to his son, Mausolus. Hecatomnus, a local dynast under the Persians, took control of several of the neighboring cities and districts. After Artemisia and Mausolus, he had several other daughters and sons: Ada (adoptive mother of Alexander the Great), Idrieus, and Pixodarus. Mausolus extended his territory as far as the southwest coast of Anatolia, invading, in particular, the territory of Lycia, remarkable for its numerous monumental tombs such as the Tombs at Xanthos, from which he took his inspiration for his mausoleum.

Artemisia and Mausolus ruled from Halicarnassus over the surrounding territory for 24 years. Mausolus, although descended from local people, spoke Greek and admired the Greek way of life and government. He founded many cities of Greek design along the coast and encouraged Greek democratic traditions.
Mausolus decided to build a new capital, one as safe from capture as it was magnificent to be seen. He chose the city of Halicarnassus. Artemisia and Mausolus spent huge amounts of tax money to embellish the city. They commissioned statues, temples and buildings of gleaming marble. In 353 BC, Mausolus died, leaving Artemisia to rule alone. As the Persian satrap, and as the Hecatomnid dynast, Mausolus had planned for himself an elaborate tomb. When he died the project was continued by his siblings. The tomb became so famous that Mausolus&#x27;s name is now the eponym for all stately tombs, in the word &quot;mausoleum&quot;.

Artemisia lived for only two years after the death of her husband. The urns with their ashes were placed in the yet unfinished tomb. As a form of sacrifice, the bodies of a large number of dead animals were placed on the stairs leading to the tomb, and then the stairs were filled with stones and rubble, sealing the access. According to the historian Pliny the Elder, the craftsmen decided to stay and finish the work after the death of their patron &quot;considering that it was at once a memorial of his own fame and of the sculptor&#x27;s art&quot;.

==Construction==

It is likely that Mausolus started to plan the tomb before his death, as part of the building works in Halicarnassus, so that when he died, Artemisia continued the building project. Artemisia spared no expense in building the tomb. She sent messengers to Greece to find the most talented artists of the time. These included Scopas, the man who had supervised the rebuilding of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. The famous sculptors were (in the Vitruvius order): Leochares, Bryaxis, Scopas, and Timotheus, as well as hundreds of other craftsmen.

The tomb was erected on a hill overlooking the city. The whole structure sat in an enclosed courtyard. At the center of the courtyard was a stone platform on which the tomb sat. A stairway flanked by stone lions led to the top of the platform, which bore along its outer walls many statues of gods and goddesses. At each corner, stone warriors mounted on horseback guarded the tomb. At the center of the platform, the marble tomb rose as a square tapering block to one-third of the Mausoleum&#x27;s height. This section was covered with bas-reliefs showing action scenes, including the battle of the centaurs with the lapiths and Greeks in combat during the Amazonomachy.

On the top of this section of the tomb thirty-six slim columns, ten per side, with each corner sharing one column between two sides; rose for another third of the height. Standing between each pair of columns was a statue. Behind the columns was a solid cella-like block that carried the weight of the tomb&#x27;s massive roof. The roof, which comprised most of the final third of the height, was pyramidal. Perched on the top was a quadriga: four massive horses pulling a chariot in which rode images of Mausolus and Artemisia.

==History==

Modern historians have pointed out that two years would not be enough time to decorate and build such a complex and extravagant building. Therefore, it is believed that construction was begun by Mausolus before his death or continued by the next leaders. The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus resembled a temple and the only way to tell the difference was its slightly higher outer walls. The Mausoleum was in the Greek-dominated area of Halicarnassus, which in 353 was controlled by the Achaemenid Empire. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, it was built by Satyros and Pytheus who wrote a treatise about it; this treatise is now lost. Pausanias adds that the Romans considered the Mausoleum one of the greatest wonders of the world and it was for that reason that they called all their magnificent tombs mausolea, after it.

It is unknown exactly when and how the Mausoleum came to ruin: Eustathius, writing in the 12th century on his commentary of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, says &quot;it was and is a wonder&quot;. Because of this, Fergusson concluded that the building was ruined, probably by an earthquake, between this period and 1402, when the Knights of St John of Jerusalem arrived and recorded that it was in ruins. However, Luttrell notes that at that time, the local Greeks and Turks had no name for – or legends to account for – the colossal ruins, suggesting a destruction at a much earlier period.

Many of the stones from the ruins were used by the knights to fortify their castle at Bodrum; they also recovered bas-reliefs with which they decorated the new building. Much of the marble was burned into lime. In 1846, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe obtained permission to remove these reliefs from the castle.

At the original site, all that remained by the 19th century were the foundations and some broken sculptures. This site was originally indicated by Professor Donaldson and was discovered definitively by Charles Newton, after which an expedition was sent by the British government. The expedition lasted three years and ended in the sending of the remaining marbles. At some point before or after this, grave robbers broke into and destroyed the underground burial chamber, but in 1972, there was still enough of it remaining to determine a layout of the chambers when they were excavated.

This monument was ranked the seventh wonder of the world by the ancients, not because of its size or strength but because of the beauty of its design and how it was decorated with sculpture or ornaments. The mausoleum was Halicarnassus&#x27;s principal architectural monument, standing in a dominant position on rising ground above the harbor.

===Jar of Xerxes I===
A jar in calcite or alabaster, an &quot;alabastron&quot;, with the quadrilingual signature of Achaemenid ruler Xerxes I (ruled 486–465 BC) was discovered in the ruins of the Mausoleum, at the foot of the western staircase. The vase contains an inscription in Old Persian, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Elamite:

Such jars, of Egyptian origin, were very precious to the Achaemenids, and may therefore have been offered by Xerxes to Carian rulers, and then kept as a precious object. In particular, the precious jar may have been offered by Xerxes to the Carian dynast Artemisia I, who had acted with merit as his only female Admiral during the Second Persian invasion of Greece, and particularly at the Battle of Salamis. The jar testifies to the close contacts between Carian rulers and the Achaemenid Empire.

==Dimensions and statues==

Much of the information that has been gathered about the Mausoleum and its structure has come from the Roman polymath Pliny the Elder. He wrote some basic facts about the architecture and some dimensions. The building was rectangular, not square, surrounded by a colonnade of thirty-six columns. There was a pyramidal superstructure receding in twenty-four steps to the summit. On top there were 4 horse chariots of marble. The building was accented with both sculptural friezes and free-standing figures. &quot;The free standing figures were arranged on 5 or 6 different levels.&quot;

We are now able to justify that Pliny&#x27;s knowledge came from a work written by the architect. It is clear that Pliny did not grasp the design of the mausoleum fully which creates problems in recreating the structure. He does state many facts which help the reader recreate pieces of the puzzle. Other writings by Pausanias, Strabo, and Vitruvius also help us to gather more information about the Mausoleum.

According to Pliny, the mausoleum was north and south, shorter on other fronts, perimeter, and 25 cubits () in height. It was surrounded by 36 columns. They called this part the pteron. Above the pteron there was a pyramid on top with 24 steps and equal in height to the lower part. The height of the building was .

The only other author that gives the dimensions of the Mausoleum is Hyginus, a grammarian in the time of Augustus. He describes the monument as built with shining stones, high and in circumference. He likely meant cubits which would match Pliny&#x27;s dimensions exactly but this text is largely considered corrupt and is of little importance. We learn from Vitruvius that Satyros and Phytheus wrote a description of their work which Pliny likely read. Pliny likely wrote down these dimensions without thinking about the form of the building.

Many statues were found slightly larger than life-size, either . or . in length; these were 20 lion statues. Another important find was the depth on the rock on which the building stood. This rock was excavated to deep over an area . The sculptures on the north were created by Scopas, the ones on the east Bryaxis, on the south Timotheus and on the west Leochares.

The Mausoleum was adorned with many great and beautiful sculptures. Some of these sculptures have been lost or only fragments have been found. Several of the statues&#x27; original placements are only known through historical accounts. The great figures of Mausolus and Artemisia stood in the chariot at the top of the pyramid. The detached equestrian groups are placed at the corners of the sub-podium. The semi-colossal female heads may have belonged to the acroteria of the two gables which may have represented the six Carian towns incorporated in Halicarnassus. Work still continues today as groups continue to excavate and research the mausoleum&#x27;s art.

==Later history ==
The Mausoleum overlooked the city of Halicarnassus for many years. It was untouched when the city fell to Alexander the Great in 334 BC and still undamaged after attacks by pirates in 62 and 58 BC. It stood above the city&#x27;s ruins for sixteen centuries. Then a series of earthquakes shattered the columns and sent the bronze chariot crashing to the ground. By AD 1404, only the base of the Mausoleum was still recognizable.

The Knights of St John of Rhodes invaded the region and built Bodrum Castle (&quot;Castle of Saint Peter&quot;). When they decided to fortify it in 1494, they used the stones of the Mausoleum. This is also about when &quot;imaginative reconstructions&quot; of the Mausoleum began to appear. In 1522, rumours of a Turkish invasion caused the Crusaders to strengthen the castle at Halicarnassus (which was by then known as Bodrum) and much of the remaining portions of the tomb were broken up and used in the castle walls. Sections of polished marble from the tomb can still be seen there today. Suleiman the Magnificent conquered the base of the knights on the island of Rhodes, who then relocated first briefly to Sicily and later permanently to Malta, leaving the Castle and Bodrum to the Ottoman Empire.

During the fortification work, a party of knights entered the base of the monument and discovered the room containing a great coffin. In many histories of the Mausoleum one can find the following story of what happened: the party, deciding it was too late to open it that day, returned the next morning to find the tomb, and any treasure it may have contained, plundered. The bodies of Mausolus and Artemisia were missing too. The small museum building next to the site of the Mausoleum tells the story. Research done by archeologists in the 1960s shows that long before the knights came, grave robbers had dug a tunnel under the grave chamber, stealing its contents. Also, the museum states that it is most likely that Mausolus and Artemisia were cremated, so only an urn with their ashes was placed in the grave chamber. This explains why no bodies were found.

Before grinding and burning much of the remaining sculpture of the Mausoleum into lime for plaster, the Knights removed several of the best works and mounted them in the Bodrum castle. There they stayed for three centuries.

==Discovery and excavation==

In the 19th century, a British consul stole several of the statues from Bodrum Castle; these now reside in the British Museum. In 1852, the British Museum sent the archaeologist Charles Thomas Newton to search for more remains of the Mausoleum. He had a difficult job. He did not know the exact location of the tomb, and the cost of buying up all the small parcels of land in the area to look for it would have been astronomical. Instead, Newton studied the accounts of ancient writers like Pliny to obtain the approximate size and location of the memorial, then bought a plot of land in the most likely location. Digging down, Newton explored the surrounding area through tunnels he dug under the surrounding plots. He was able to locate some walls, a staircase, and finally three of the corners of the foundation. With this knowledge, Newton was able to determine which plots of land he needed to buy.

Newton then excavated the site and found sections of the reliefs that decorated the wall of the building and portions of the stepped roof. Also discovered was a broken stone chariot wheel some in diameter, which came from the sculpture on the Mausoleum&#x27;s roof. Finally, he found the statues of Mausolus and Artemisia that had stood at the pinnacle of the building. In October 1857, Newton carried blocks of marble from this site by and landed them in Malta. These blocks were used for the construction of a new dock in Malta for the Royal Navy. Today this dock is known as Dock No. 1 in Cospicua, but the building blocks are hidden from view, submerged in Dockyard Creek in the Grand Harbour.

From 1966 to 1977, the Mausoleum was thoroughly researched by Kristian Jeppesen of Aarhus University, Denmark. He has produced a six-volume monograph, &quot;The Maussolleion at Halikarnassos&quot;.

The beauty of the Mausoleum was not only in the structure itself, but in the decorations and statues that adorned the outside at different levels on the podium and the roof: statues of people, lions, horses, and other animals in varying scales. The four Greek sculptors who carved the statues: Bryaxis, Leochares, Scopas and Timotheus were each responsible for one side. Because the statues were of people and animals, the Mausoleum holds a special place in history, as it was not dedicated to the gods of Ancient Greece.

Today, the massive castle of the Knights Hospitaller (Knights of St. John) still stands in Bodrum, and the polished stone and marble blocks of the Mausoleum can be spotted built into the walls of the structure. At the site of the Mausoleum, only the foundation remains, and a small museum. Some of the surviving sculptures at the British Museum include fragments of statues and many slabs of the frieze showing the battle between the Greeks and the Amazons. There the images of Mausolus and his queen watch over the few broken remains of the beautiful tomb she built for him.


==Influence on modern architecture==
Modern buildings whose designs were based upon or influenced by interpretations of the design of the Mausoleum of Mausolus include Fourth and Vine Tower in Cincinnati; the Civil Courts Building in St. Louis; the National Newark Building in Newark, New Jersey; Grant&#x27;s Tomb and 26 Broadway in New York City; Los Angeles City Hall; the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne; the spire of St. George&#x27;s Church, Bloomsbury in London; the Indiana War Memorial (and in turn Salesforce Tower) in Indianapolis; the House of the Temple in Washington D.C.; the National Diet in Tokyo; the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh; and the in Peoria, IL.

== Gallery of 2nd century replica site ==
In Milas (also the site of the tomb of Hecatomnus, who was the father of Mausolus), is also the site of the Gümüşkesen, a small-scale Roman-era (2nd century BC) copy of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus:
