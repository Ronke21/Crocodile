<text>The Basilica of Saint-Denis (, now formally known as the ) is a large former medieval abbey church and present cathedral in the commune of Saint-Denis, a northern suburb of Paris. The building is of singular importance historically and architecturally as its choir, completed in 1144, is widely considered the first structure to employ all of the elements of Gothic architecture.

The basilica became a place of pilgrimage and a necropolis containing the tombs of the kings of France, including nearly every king from the 10th century to Louis XVIII in the 19th century. Henry IV of France came to Saint-Denis formally to renounce his Protestant faith and become a Catholic. The queens of France were crowned at Saint-Denis, and the regalia, including the sword used for crowning the kings and the royal sceptre, were kept at Saint-Denis between coronations.

The site originated as a Gallo-Roman cemetery in late Roman times. The archaeological remains still lie beneath the cathedral; the graves indicate a mixture of Christian and pre-Christian burial practices. Around the year AD 475, St. Genevieve purchased some land and built Saint-Denys de la Chapelle. In 636, on the orders of Dagobert I, the relics of Saint Denis, a patron saint of France, were reinterred in the basilica. The relics of St-Denis, which had been transferred to the parish church of the town in 1795, were brought back again to the abbey in 1819.

In the 12th century, the Abbot Suger rebuilt portions of the abbey church using innovative structural and decorative features. In doing so, he is said to have created the first truly Gothic building. In the following century the master-builder Pierre de Montreuil rebuilt the nave and the transepts in the new Rayonnant Gothic style.

The abbey church became a cathedral on the formation of the Diocese of Saint-Denis by Pope Paul VI in 1966 and is the seat of the Bishop of Saint-Denis, currently (since 2009) Pascal Delannoy. Although known as the &quot;Basilica of St Denis&quot;, the cathedral has not been granted the title of Minor Basilica by the Vatican.

The tall spire, dismantled in the 19th century, is to be rebuilt. The project initiated more than 30 years ago, was decided in 2018 with a signed agreement, with initial restoration work beginning in 2022. From 2025, the building project will commence, with visitors of the cathedral being able to observe the building works as part of their tour. The project is planned to be completed by 2029, with a cost of 37 million euro.

== History ==
=== Early churches ===
The cathedral is on the site where Saint Denis, the first bishop of Paris, is believed to have been buried. According to the &quot;Life of Saint Genevieve&quot;, written in about 520, he was sent by Pope Clement I to evangelise the Parisii. He was arrested and condemned by the Roman authorities. Along with two of his followers, the priest Rusticus and deacon Eleutherius, he was decapitated on the hill of Montmartre in about 250 AD. According to the legend, he is said to have carried his head four leagues to the Roman settlement of Catulliacus, the site of the current church, and indicated that it was where he wanted to be buried. A martyrium or shrine-mausoleum was erected on the site of his grave in about 313 AD, and was enlarged into a basilica with the addition of tombs and monuments under Saint Genevieve. These including a royal tomb, that of Aregonde, the wife of King Clothar I.
Dagobert I, King of the Franks (reigned 628 to 637), transformed the church into the Abbey of Saint Denis, a Benedictine monastery in 632. It soon grew to a community of more than five hundred monks, plus their servants.

Dagobert also commissioned a new shrine to house the saint&#x27;s remains, which was created by his chief councillor, Eligius, a goldsmith by training. An early &quot;vita&quot; of Saint Eligius describes the shrine:

:Above all, Eligius fabricated a mausoleum for the holy martyr Denis in the city of Paris with a wonderful marble ciborium over it marvelously decorated with gold and gems. He composed a crest [at the top of a tomb] and a magnificent frontal and surrounded the throne of the altar with golden axes in a circle. He placed golden apples there, round and jeweled. He made a pulpit and a gate of silver and a roof for the throne of the altar on silver axes. He made a covering in the place before the tomb and fabricated an outside altar at the feet of the holy martyr. So much industry did he lavish there, at the king&#x27;s request, and poured out so much that scarcely a single ornament was left in Gaul, and it is the greatest wonder of all to this very day.

===The Carolingian church===

During his second coronation at Saint-Denis, King Pepin the Short made a vow to rebuild the old abbey. The first church mentioned in the chronicles was begun in 754 and completed under Charlemagne, who was present at its consecration in 775. By 832 the Abbey had been granted a remunerative whaling concession on the Cotentin Peninsula.

According to one of the Abbey&#x27;s many foundation myths a leper, who was sleeping in the nearly completed church the night before its planned consecration, witnessed a blaze of light from which Christ, accompanied by St Denis and a host of angels, emerged to conduct the consecration ceremony himself. Before leaving, Christ healed the leper, tearing off his diseased skin to reveal a perfect complexion underneath. A mis-shapen patch on a marble column was said to be the leper&#x27;s former skin, which stuck there when Christ discarded it. Having been consecrated by Christ, the fabric of the building was itself regarded as sacred.

Most of what is now known about the Carolingian church at St Denis resulted from a lengthy series of excavations begun under the American art historian Sumner McKnight Crosby in 1937. The structure altogether was about eighty meters long, with an imposing facade, a nave divided into three sections by two rows of marble columns, a transept, and apse and at the east end. During important religious celebrations, the interior of the church was lit with 1250 lamps. Beneath the apse, in imitation of St. Peter&#x27;s in Rome, a crypt was constructed, with a Confession, or martyr&#x27;s chapel, in the center. Inside this was a platform on which the sarcophagus of Denis was displayed, with those of his companions Rusticus and Eleutherus on either side. Around the platform was a corridor where pilgrims could circulate, and bays with windows. Traces of painted decoration of this original crypt can be seen in some of the bays.

The crypt was not large enough for the growing number of pilgrims who came, so in about 832 the abbot Hilduin built a second crypt, to the west of the first, and a small new chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary was constructed next to the apse. The new crypt was extensively rebuilt under Suger in the 12th century.

=== Suger and the Early Gothic Church (12th century) ===

Abbot Suger (c. 1081 – 1151), the patron of the rebuilding of the Abbey church, had begun his career in the church at the age of ten, and rose to become the Abbot in 1122. He was a school companion and then confidant and minister of Louis VI and then of his son Louis VII, and was a regent of Louis VII when the King was absent on the Crusades. He was an accomplished fund-raiser, acquiring treasures for the cathedral and collecting an enormous sum for its rebuilding. In about 1135 he began reconstructing and enlarging the abbey. In his famous account of the work undertaken during his administration, Suger explained his decision to rebuild the church, due to the decrepit state of the old structure and its inability to cope with the crowds of pilgrims visiting the shrine of St Denis.

In the 12th century, thanks largely to Suger, the Basilica became a principal sanctuary of French Royalty, rivalling Reims Cathedral, where the kings were crowned. The Abbey also kept the regalia of the coronation, including the robes, crowns and sceptre. Beginning in 1124, and until the mid-15th century, the kings departed for war carrying the oriflamme, or battle flag, of St. Denis, to give the King the protection of the Saint. It was taken to the Abbey only when France was in danger. The flag was retired in 1488, when the Parisians opened the gates of Paris to invading English and Burgundian armies.

==== First Phase: the west front (1135–1140) ====
Suger began his rebuilding project at the western end of St Denis, demolishing the old Carolingian facade with its single, centrally located door. He extended the old nave westwards by an additional four bays and added a massive western Narthex, incorporating a new façade and three chapels on the first floor level.

In the new design, massive vertical buttresses separated the three doorways and horizontal string-courses and window arcades clearly marked out the divisions. This clear delineation of parts was to influence subsequent west façade designs as a common theme in the development of Gothic architecture and a marked departure from the Romanesque. The portals themselves were sealed by gilded bronze doors, ornamented with scenes from Christ&#x27;s Passion. They clearly recorded Suger&#x27;s patronage with the following inscription:

On the lintel below the great tympanum showing the Last Judgement, beneath a carved figure of the kneeling Abbot, was inscribed the more modest plea;
Receive, stern Judge, the prayers of your Suger, Let me be mercifully numbered among your sheep.

====Second Phase: the new choir, (1140–1144)====
Suger&#x27;s western extension was completed in 1140 and the three new chapels in the narthex were consecrated on 9 June of that year, but the Romanesque nave between was yet unchanged. He wrote about the new narthex at the west end and proposed chapels at the east: &quot;Once the new rear part is joined to the part in front, the church shines with its middle part brightened. For bright is that which is brightly coupled with the bright, and bright is the noble edifice which is pervaded by the new light.&quot;

Suger&#x27;s great innovation in the new choir was the replacement of the heavy dividing walls in the apse and ambulatory with slender columns, so that the interior of that part of the church was filled with light. He described &quot;A circular string of chapels, by virtue of which the whole church would shine with the wonderful and uninterrupted light of most luminous windows, pervading the interior beauty.&quot;
One of these chapels was dedicated to Saint Osmanna, and held her relics.

Suger&#x27;s masons drew on elements which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture: the rib vault with pointed arches, and exterior buttresses which made it possible to have larger windows and to eliminate interior walls. It was the first time that these features had all been drawn together; and the new style evolved radically from the previous Romanesque architecture by the lightness of the structure and the unusually large size of the stained glass windows.

The new architecture was full of symbolism. The twelve columns in the choir represented the twelve Apostles, and the light represented the Holy Spirit.
Like many French clerics in the 12th century AD, he was a follower of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a 6th century mystic who equated the slightest reflection or glint with divine light. Suger&#x27;s own words were carved in the nave: &quot;For bright is that which is brightly coupled with the bright/and bright is the noble edifice which is pervaded by the new light.&quot; Following Suger&#x27;s example, large stained glass windows filling the interior with mystical light became a prominent feature of Gothic architecture.

Two different architects, or master masons, were involved in the 12th century rebuilding. Both remain anonymous but their work can be distinguished on stylistic grounds. The first, who was responsible for the initial work at the western end, favoured conventional Romanesque capitals and moulding profiles with rich and individualised detailing. His successor, who completed the western facade and upper storeys of the narthex, before going on to build the new choir, displayed a more restrained approach to decorative effects, relying on a simple repertoire of motifs, which may have proved more suitable for the lighter Gothic style that he helped to create.

The Portal of Valois was the last of the Gothic structures planned by Suger. It was designed for the original building, but was not yet begun when Suger died in 1151. In the 13th century it was moved to the end of the new transept on the north side of the church. The sculpture of the portal includes six standing figures in the embracements and thirty figures in the voussures, or arches, over the doorway, which probably represent the Kings of the Old Testament. The scene in the Tympanum over the doorway depicts the martyrdom of Saint Denis. In their realism and finesse, they were a landmark in Gothic sculpture.

The new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The Abbey of St Denis thus became the prototype for further building in the royal domain of northern France. Through the rule of the Angevin dynasty, the style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the Low Countries, Germany, Spain, northern Italy and Sicily.

=== Reconstruction of the Nave – the Rayonnant style – beginning of the Royal Necropolis (13th century) ===

Suger died in 1151 with the Gothic reconstruction incomplete. In 1231, Abbot Odo Clement began work on the rebuilding of the Carolingian nave, which remained sandwiched incongruously between Suger&#x27;s Gothic works to the east and west. Both the nave and the upper parts of Suger&#x27;s choir were replaced in the Rayonnant Gothic style. From the start it appears that Abbot Odo, with the approval of the Regent Blanche of Castile and her son, the young King Louis IX, planned for the new nave and its large crossing to have a much clearer focus as the French &#x27;royal necropolis&#x27;, or burial place. That plan was fulfilled in 1264 under Abbot Matthew of Vendôme when the bones of 16 former kings and queens were relocated to new tombs arranged around the crossing, eight Carolingian monarchs to the south and eight Capetians to the north. These tombs, featuring lifelike carved recumbent effigies or &quot;gisants&quot; lying on raised bases, were badly damaged during the French revolution though all but two were subsequently restored by Viollet le Duc in 1860.

The dark Romanesque nave, with its thick walls and small window-openings, was rebuilt using the very latest techniques, in what is now known as Rayonnant Gothic. This new style, which differed from Suger&#x27;s earlier works as much as they had differed from their Romanesque precursors, reduced the wall area to an absolute minimum. Solid masonry was replaced with vast window openings filled with brilliant stained glass (all destroyed in the Revolution) and interrupted only by the most slender of bar tracery—not only in the clerestory but also, perhaps for the first time, in the normally dark triforium level. The upper facades of the two much-enlarged transepts were filled with two spectacular 12m-wide rose windows. As with Suger&#x27;s earlier rebuilding work, the identity of the architect or master mason remains unknown. Although often attributed to Pierre de Montreuil, the only evidence for his involvement is an unrelated document of 1247 which refers to him as &#x27;a mason from Saint-Denis&#x27;.

===15th–17th century===
During the following centuries, the cathedral was pillaged twice; once during the Hundred Years War (1337–1453) and again during the Wars of Religion (1562–1598). Damage was largely limited to broken tombs and precious objects stolen from the altars and treasury. Many modifications were made under Marie de&#x27; Medici and later royal families. These included the construction of chapel adjoining the north transept to serve as a tomb for the monarchs of the Valois Dynasty (later demolished). A plan of by Félibien shows the Valois Chapel, a large mortuary chapel in the form of a domed colonnaded &quot;rotunda&quot;, adjoining the north transept of the basilica and containing the tomb of the Valois. and the display of the skeleton of a baleine whale in the nave in 1771. Greater harm was done with the removal of the early Gothic column-statues which Suger had used to decorate the west front. (They were replaced with replicas in the 19th century). In 1700, reconstruction began of the monastic buildings adjacent to the church. This was not completed until the mid-18th century. Into these buildings Napoleon installed a school for the daughters of members of the French Legion of Honour, which still is in operation.

=== The French Revolution and Napoleon ===

Due to its connections to the French monarchy and proximity to Paris, the abbey of Saint-Denis was a prime target of revolutionary vandalism. On Friday, 14 September 1792, the monks celebrated their last services in the abbey church; the monastery was dissolved the next day. The church was used to store grain and flour. In 1793, the National Convention, the revolutionary government, ordered the violation of the sepulchres and the destruction of the royal tombs, but agreed to create a commission to select those monuments which were of historical interest for preservation. In 1798, these were transferred to the chapel of the Petit-Augustins, which later became the Museum of French Monuments.

Most of the medieval monastic buildings were demolished in 1792. Although the church itself was left standing, it was profaned, its treasury confiscated and its reliquaries and liturgical furniture melted down for their metallic value. Some objects, including a chalice and aquamanile donated to the abbey in Suger&#x27;s time, were successfully hidden and survive to this day. The jamb figures of the façade representing Old Testament royalty, mistakenly identified as images of royal French kings and queens, were removed from the portals and the tympana sculpture defaced.

In 1794, the government decided to remove the lead tiles from the roof, to melt them down to make bullets. This left the interior of the church badly exposed to the weather.

=== 19th century – reconstruction and renovation ===

The church was reconsecrated by Napoléon in 1806, and he designated it as the future site for his own tomb and those of his intended dynasty. He also ordered the construction of three chapels to honour the last French kings, created a chapel under the authority of his uncle, Cardinal Fesch, which was decorated with richly-carved choir stalls and marquetry from the Château de Gaillon. (See &quot;Choir Stalls&quot; section below).

After Napoleon&#x27;s downfall, the ashes of the previous king, Louis XVI, were ceremoniously moved from the cemetery of the Madeleine to Saint-Denis. The last king to be entombed in Saint-Denis was Louis XVIII in 1824.

In 1813 François Debret was named the chief architect of the cathedral; he proceeded, over thirty years, to repair the Revolutionary damage. He was later best known for his design of the Salle Le Peletier, the primary opera house of Paris before the Opéra Garnier in 1873. He replaced the upper stained glass windows in the nave with depictions of the historic kings of France, and added new windows to the transept depicting the renovation, and the July 1837 visit to the Cathedral of King Louis Philippe. On 9 June, the spire of the tower was struck by lightning and destroyed. Debret rapidly put into place a new spire, but he did not fully understand the principles of Gothic architecture. He made errors in his plans for the new structure, which resulted in the spire and tower collapsing under their own weight in 1845.

Debret resigned and was replaced by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, who had the support of Prosper Mérimée, the French author who led campaign for the restoration of ruined Gothic architecture in France. Viollet-le-Duc continued working on the Abbey until his death in 1879, and replaced many of the creations conceived by Debret. Viollet-le-Duc focused on the tombs, rearranging and transforming portions of the interior into a vast museum of French sculpture. In the 1860s Emperor Napoleon III asked Viollet-le-Duc to construct an imperial section in the crypt for him and his dynasty, but he was deposed and went into exile before it was begun.

===20th and 21st centuries===

In 1895, when the chapter created by Napoleon was dissolved, the church lost its cathedral rank and reverted to being a parish church. It did not become a cathedral again until 1966, with the creation of the new diocese of Saint-Denis. The formal title is now the &quot;Baslilique-cathédrale de Saint-Denis&quot;.

In December 2016, 170 years after the north tower&#x27;s dismantlement and following several false starts, the Ministry of Culture again proposed its reconstruction after concluding it was technically feasible—albeit without public funding. An association, &quot;Suivez la flèche&quot; (&quot;Follow the Spire&quot;), chaired by Patrick Braouezec, has since been established to support the reconstruction, with the aim of raising the necessary funds by opening the reconstruction works to the general public, along the model of the Guédelon Castle. In March 2018, the culture ministry signed an accord with the association, officially launching the reconstruction project, with works expected to commence in May 2020. A year later, French scholars were still divided on the €25 million proposal to reconstruct the spire. In 2023, hundreds of anonymous graves dating from the 5th to the 14th century were discovered in the Basilica. In the same year, the Basilica&#x27;s stained glass windows which have been the central focus of a project spanning 25 years, entered the final stage of restoration with a total cost exceeding 2 million euros.

==Exterior==
=== The west front ===

The west front of the church, dedicated on 9 June 1140, is divided into three sections, each with its own entrance, representing the Holy Trinity. A crenellated parapet runs across the west front and connects the towers (still unfinished in 1140), illustrating that the church front was the symbolic entrance to the celestial Jerusalem.

This new façade, wide and deep, has three portals, the central one larger than those on either side, reflecting the relative width of the central nave and lateral aisles. This tripartite arrangement was clearly influenced by the late 11th century Norman-Romanesque façades of the abbey churches of St Etienne. It also shared with them a three-storey elevation and flanking towers. Only the south tower survives; the north tower was dismantled following a tornado which struck in 1846.

The west front was originally decorated with a series of column statues, representing the kings and queens of the Old Testament. These were removed in 1771 and were mostly destroyed during the French Revolution, though a number of the heads can be seen in the Musée de Cluny in Paris.

The bronze doors of the central portal are modern, but are a faithful reproduction of the original doors, which depicted the Passion of Christ and the Resurrection.

One other original feature was added by Suger&#x27;s builders; a rose window over the central portal. Although small circular windows (oculi) within triangular tympana were common on the west facades of Italian Romanesque churches, this was probably the first example of a rose window within a square frame, which was to become a dominant feature of the Gothic facades of northern France (soon to be imitated at Chartres Cathedral and many others).

=== Chevet and transepts ===

The chevet, at the east end of the cathedral, was one of the first parts of the structure rebuilt into the Gothic style. The work was commissioned by Abbot Suger in 1140 and completed in 1144. It was considerably modified under the young King Louis IX and his mother, Blanche of Castille, the Regent of the Kingdom, beginning in 1231. The apse was built much higher, along with the nave. Large flying buttresses were added to the chevet, to support the upper walls, and to make possible the enormous windows installed there. The masons used the same engineering concept that was used at the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs to support the large chapel windows. At the same time, the transept was enlarged and given large rose windows in the new rayonnant style, divided into multiple lancet windows topped by trilobe windows and other geometric forms inscribed in circles. The walls of the nave on both sides were entirely filled with windows, each composed of four lancets topped by a rose, filling the entire space above the triforium. The upper walls, like the chevet, were supported by flying buttresses whose bases were placed between the chapels alongside the nave.

===North and south portals===

The Porte de Valois, or north portal, was originally built in the 12th century, near the end of Suger&#x27;s life, then rebuilt at the end of the north transept in the 13th century. According to Suger, the original entrance on the north did not have sculpture, but mosaic, which Suger replaced by sculpture in 1540. It is considered an important step in the history of Gothic sculpture, because of the skill of the carving, and the lack of rigidity of the figures. There are six figures in the embrasures and thirty figures in the voussures, or arches above the door, which represent kings, probably those of the Old Testament, while the tympanum over the door illustrates the martyrdom of Saint-Denis and his companions Eleuthere and Rusticus. This portal was among the last works commissioned by Suger; he died in 1151, before it was completed.
The original sculpture that was destroyed in the Revolution was replaced with sculpture from the early 19th century, made by Felix Brun.

The tympanum of the south portal illustrates the last days of the Denis and his companions before their martyrdom. The piedroits are filled with medallions representing the labours of the days of month.

==Interior==
===The nave and choir===

The nave, the portion to the west of the church reserved for ordinary worshippers, and the choir, the portion to the east reserved for the clergy, were rebuilt into the Gothic style in the 13th century, after the apse at the east and the west front. Like the other Gothic churches in the Ile-de-France, its walls had three levels; large arcades of massive pillars on the ground floor; a narrow triforium or passageway midway up the wall; originally windowless; and a row of high windows the clerestory, above. Slender columns rose from the pillars up the walls to support the four-part rib vaults. As a result of the Rayonnant reconstruction in the triforium was given windows, and the upper walls were entirely filled with glass, which reached upward into the arches of the vaults, flooding the church with light.

=== The disambulatory and chapels ===

The chevet had been constructed by Suger in record time, in just four years, between 1140 and 1144, and was one of the first great realisations of Gothic architecture. The double disambulatory is divided not by walls but by two rows of columns, while the outside walls, thanks to buttresses on the exterior, are filled with windows. The new system allowed light to pass into the interior of the choir. The disambulatory connects with the five radiating chapels at the east end of the cathedral, which have their own large windows. To give them greater unity, the five chapels share the same system of vaulted roofs. To make the walls between the chapels even less visible, they are masked with networks of slender columns and tracery.

The apse with its two ambulatories and axial chapels was extensively rebuilt in the 12th century, to connect harmoniously with the new and larger nave, but a major effort was made to save the early Gothic features created by Suger, including the double disambulatory with its large windows. To accomplish this, four large pillars were installed in the crypt to support the upper level, and the walls of the first traverse of the sanctuary were placed at an angle to connect with the wider transept.

The basilica retains stained glass of many periods (although most of the panels from Suger&#x27;s time have been removed for long-term conservation and replaced with photographic transparencies), including exceptional modern glass, and a set of 12 misericords.

=== Crypt and royal tombs ===

The role of St. Denis as the necropolis of French kings formally began under Hugh Capet (987–996), but the tombs of several earlier kings were already located there. The site was chosen because of its association with St. Denis, the first Bishop of Paris and one of the earliest Christian leaders in France, who was buried there All but three of the monarchs of France from the 10th century until 1793 have their remains here. The remains of some monarchs, including Clovis I (465–511), were moved to St. Denis from other churches.

The crypt beneath the church is divided into two sections; the older, called archeological crypt, is located under the transept, and was originally built in about 775 AD, when the abbey was reconstructed by Abbot Fuldiad. It had a disambulatory, passage which allowed pilgrims to circulate around the relics of Saint Denis and his companions on display in the center. It was lit by alternating small windows in the walls and lamps placed in niches.

The crypt was rebuilt and extended eastward by Suger. The walls were decorated with blind arches, divided by columns whose capitals illustrate Biblical scenes and scenes from the life of St. Denis. Thirty-nine of the original Romanesque sixty-two capitals are still in place. Sugar constructed a new disambulatory connected with radiating chapels.

During the reign of Henry IV, the central portion of this crypt was devoted the Bourbon dynasty, but the tombs themselves were simple lead coffins in wood cases. The effigies of many of the kings and queens are on their tombs, but during the French Revolution their bodies were thrown out of their coffins, dumped into three trenches and covered with lime to destroy them. The older monarchs were removed in August 1793 to celebrate the revolutionary Festival of Reunion, the Valois and Bourbon monarchs in October 1793 to celebrate the execution of Marie Antoinette. Preservationist Alexandre Lenoir saved many of the monuments by claiming them as artworks for his Museum of French Monuments. The bodies of several Plantagenet monarchs of England were likewise removed from Fontevraud Abbey during the French Revolution. Napoleon Bonaparte reopened the church in 1806, but left the royal remains in their mass graves. In 1817 the restored Bourbons ordered the mass graves to be opened, but only portions of three bodies remained intact. The remaining bones from 158 bodies were collected into an ossuary in the crypt of the church, behind marble plates bearing their names.

In later years, tombs were placed along the aisles that surrounded around the choir and the nave. In the 13th century King Louis IX (Saint Louis) commissioned a number of important tombs of earlier kings and French historical figures, whose remains were collected from other churches. These included the tombs of Clovis I, Charles Martel, Constance of Castile, Pepin the Short, Robert the Pious and Hugh Capet (which disappeared during the Revolution). The new tombs were all made in the same style and costume, with a reposing figure holding a staff, to illustrate the continuity of the French Monarchy.

The tombs of the Renaissance expressed are theatrical and varied. The largest is that of Louis XII (died 1515) and his wife, Anne of Brittany (died 1514). It takes the form of a white marble temple filled and surrounded with figures. Inside it, the King and Queen are depicted realistically in their dying agonies, Allegorical figures seated around the temple depict the virtues of the King and Queen. On the roof of the tomb, the King and Queen are shown again, kneeling and calmly praying, celebrating their victory over death, thanks to their virtues.

The monument to Henry II of France and Catherine de Medici (1559) followed a similar format; a Roman temple, in this case designed by the celebrated Renaissance architect Primatrice with sculpture on the roof depicting the King and Queen in prayer. The King places his hand on his heart illustrating his Catholic faith a period of religious conflicts.

In the 19th century, following the restoration of the monarchy, Louis XVIII had the remains of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette brought to St. Denis. The body of the Dauphin, who died of illness and neglect at the hands of his revolutionary captors, was buried in an unmarked grave in a Parisian churchyard near the Temple. During Napoleon&#x27;s exile in Elba, the restored Bourbons ordered a search for the corpses of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. They were found on 21 January 1815, brought to Saint-Denis and placed in the archeologi crypt. Their tombs are covered with black marble slabs installed in 1975.

Louis XVIII, upon his death in 1824, was buried in the centre of the crypt, near the graves of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The coffins of royal family members who died between 1815 and 1830 were also placed in the vaults. Under the direction of architect Viollet-le-Duc, church monuments that had been taken to the Museum of French Monuments were returned to the church. The corpse of Louis VII, who had been buried at Barbeau Abbey and whose tomb had not been touched by the revolutionaries, was brought to Saint-Denis and buried in the crypt. In 2004, the mummified heart of the Dauphin, the boy who would have been Louis XVII, verified to be authentic by DNA testing, was placed in a crystal vase and sealed into the wall of the crypt.
=== Sacristy ===

The Sacristy, the room where the clergy traditionally donned their vestments, was transformed by the architect Jacques Cellerier in 1812 into a Neo-classical gallery of murals which depict scenes from the history of the cathedral. A work added to the Sacristy is &quot;Allegory of the Divine Word&quot;, a painting by Simon Vouet, which originally had been commissioned by Louis XIII for the retable of the Chateau of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. It was acquired for the cathedral by the administration of national monuments in 1993. The wall cases also display a selection of precious objects from the cathedral&#x27;s collection.

== Art and decoration ==
=== Stained glass ===
Abbot Suger commissioned a large amount of stained glass for the new chevet, but only very small amount of the original glass from the time of Suger survived intact. In the 19th century it was collected by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, and was integrated into windows in the chevet. Original glass includes the figure of Suger prostrating himself at the feet of the Virgin Mary, in the window called &quot;The Childhood of Christ&quot;; and kneeling in the lower right corner of the Tree of Jesse, illustrating the genealogy of Christ, in the Axis chapel; the &quot;Allegories of Saint Paul&quot; and &quot;The Life of Moses&quot; in the fourth radiating chapel on the north; &quot;The vision of Ezekiel under the sign of tau&quot;, originally from a group illustrating the Passion of Christ, in the fourth rayonnant chapel on the south, in the left bay and third register. Another piece of original window from Suger&#x27;s time, depicting mythical Griffonsa a symbol of Paradise, is found in the second radiating chapel on the north. Other scenes which Suger described, showing the pilgrimage of Charlemagne and the Crusades, have disappeared.
Much of the current stained glass dates to the 19th century, as the church began to be restored from the damage of the Revolution. The architect François Debret designed the first Neo-Gothic windows of the nave in 1813. these include the upper windows of the nave, which represent the kings and queens of France. Later upper windows of the south transept depict the restoration of the church, and particularly the visit there of Louis Philippe I, the last king of France, in 1837. This large group of windows was designed by the painter Jean-Baptiste Debret, the brother of the architect.

=== Sculpture ===
The new west front sculpture of St. Denis had an important influence on Gothic style. The influential features of the new façade include the tall, thin statues of Old Testament prophets and kings attached to columns (&quot;jamb figures&quot;) flanking the portals (destroyed in 1771 but recorded in Montfaucon&#x27;s drawings). These were also adopted at the cathedrals of Paris and Chartres, constructed a few years later, and became a feature of almost every Gothic portal thereafter.

The statues on the portal of the Valois, on the transept of the Saint Denis, made in 1175, have very elongated and expressive figures, and also had an important effect on Gothic sculpture. They were the opposite of the more restrained and dignified figures of Chartres Cathedral, made about the same time.

Above the doorways, the central tympanum was carved with Christ in Majesty displaying his wounds with the dead emerging from their tombs below. Scenes from the martyrdom of St Denis were carved above the south (right hand) portal, while above the north portal was a mosaic (lost), even though this was, as Suger put it &#x27;contrary to the modern custom&#x27;. Of the original sculpture, very little remains, most of what is now visible being the result of rather clumsy restoration work in 1839. Some fragments of the original sculptures survive in the collection of the Musée de Cluny.

==Choir stalls==

The choir stalls, the seats reserved for the clergy, have particularly fine carvings, particularly on the misericord, the small seat on each stall on which the clergy could rest when standing for long periods of time. The stalls were made in the 16th century, and were originally located in the high chapel of the Chateau de Gaillon in the Eure Department. In 1805 Napoleon Bonaparte decided to create three new chapels at Saint-Denis, as well as a chapter of bishops under the authority of his uncle, Cardinal Fesch. The stalls were moved to Saint-Denis and installed for their use. Besides the carved wood, the stalls are decorated with elaborate multi-coloured religious scenes in marquetry.

===Organ===

The organ is located on the tribune, at the west of the nave. An organ is recorded as existing at the basilica in 1520. A later organ, made by Crespin Carlier, is recorded in 1520, but this instrument was destroyed during the French Revolution. The church re-opened in 1806 without an organ. A competition was held in 1833 to find a new builder. It was won by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, age twenty-three, and was his first organ. It was completed in 1843, and launched his career as an organ-maker.

It contains numerous innovations introduced in the romantic area, in particular the very first Barker lever. With three manuals and pedals, it is protected by the label. It was restored in 1901 by Charles Mutin, and between 1983 and 1987 by Jean-Loup Boisseau and Bertrand Cattiaux. Pierre Pincemaille, sole titular organist for 30 years (between 1987 and 2018), held many recitals (between 1989 and 1995, then between 2014 and 2017), and recorded eight CDs using this instrument.

===Treasury===
The cathedral contained an extensive treasury, mainly constituted by the Abbot Suger. It contained crowns (those of Charlemagne, Saint Louis, and Henry IV of France), a cross, and liturgical objects.

==Burials==

 


===Kings===
All but five of the kings of France were buried in the basilica (with Charlemagne, Philip I, Louis XI, Charles X, &amp; Louis Philippe I buried elsewhere), as well as a few other monarchs.

<text>Lauritz Melchior (20 March 1890 – 18 March 1973) was a Danish-American opera singer. He was the preeminent Wagnerian heldentenor of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s and has come to be considered the quintessence of his voice type. Late in his career, Melchior appeared in movie musicals and on radio and television. He also made numerous recordings.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born Lauritz Lebrecht Hommel Melchior in Copenhagen, Denmark, the young Melchior was a treble and amateur singer before starting his first operatic vocal studies under Paul Bang at the Royal Opera School in Copenhagen at the age of 18 in 1908.

His sister, Agnes Melchior (1883–1945), was a blind Danish Esperantist.

In 1913, Melchior made his debut in the baritone role of Silvio in Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot; at the Royal Theatre (Det Kongelige Teater) in Copenhagen. He sang mostly secondary baritone and bass roles for the Royal Danish Opera and provincial Scandinavian opera companies for the next few years.

One night, while on tour, Melchior helped an ailing soprano performing in &quot;Il trovatore&quot; by singing a high C in the Act IV Leonora-di Luna duet. The Azucena of that performance, the American contralto Mme Charles Cahier, was impressed by the tone she had heard and gave her young colleague sound advice: he was no baritone, but a tenor &quot;with the lid on.&quot; She even wrote to the Royal Opera pleading that Melchior be given a sabbatical and a stipend to restudy his voice. This he did between 1917 and 1918, taking lessons from the noted Danish tenor Vilhelm Herold (1865–1937) who had sung Wagnerian roles in Covent Garden, Chicago and elsewhere from 1900 to 1915. This proved to be a turning point in Melchior&#x27;s career. His high baritone voice was recast into that of a low tenor, but with a strong high extension. His second debut was on 8 October 1918 in the title role of &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, also at the Royal Opera in Copenhagen.

In 1920, Melchior visited England to sing in an experimental radio broadcast to the Scandinavian capital cities from the Marconi station in Chelmsford. From 1920, Melchior was a frequent performer in London, appearing at Sir Henry J. Wood&#x27;s Prom Concerts in Queen&#x27;s Hall.

In September 1920, when he was singing the Steersman&#x27;s Song, from Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; at a Prom Concert, he met the popular novelist and passionate Wagnerite Hugh Walpole and the two quickly became firm friends, travelling together and staying in each other&#x27;s houses. On a visit to Walpole&#x27;s cottage in Polperro Melchior &quot;caused a sensation by singing at a concert in the village&quot;, and later on a visit to Helston he and Walpole both took part in the Floral Dance. In December 1921 on a visit with Walpole to his (Walpole&#x27;s) parents in Edinburgh, Melchior gave a concert in the Usher Hall. Walpole provided the fledgling Heldentenor with financial aid in February 1922, paying in advance two-thirds of the fees for his studies under Victor Beigel. In 1923, Walpole gave Melchior a further £800, enabling him to continue his studies with Ernst Grenzebach and the legendary dramatic soprano of the Vienna Court Opera, Anna Bahr von Mildenburg.

===As a leading &quot;Heldentenor&quot;===
Word of his talent spread and was heard of by Cosima and Siegfried Wagner at Bayreuth. There the re-opening of the Festival for 1924 was under preparation. Melchior was engaged to sing Siegmund and Parsifal. This prestigious contract opened the way to several other appearances such as a Wagner concert with Frida Leider in Berlin in 1923. Around this time several acoustic records were cut for Polydor.

On May 14, 1924, Lauritz Melchior made his debut, as Siegmund, at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden in London. The result was a smashing success. Some weeks later Melchior made his debut on the stage of the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth in the roles of Siegmund and Parsifal. In July 1925 Adolf Hitler attended a performance of &quot;Parsifal&quot; in Bayreuth as a guest of Winifred Wagner. According to Walpole, who was sitting in Wagner&#x27;s box next to Hitler, as Melchior sang, &quot;the tears poured down Hitler&#x27;s cheeks&quot;. On February 17, 1926, his first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City took place. He sang Tannhäuser opposite Maria Jeritza, Friedrich Schorr, Karin Branzell, and Michael Bohnen with Artur Bodanzky conducting. Although he was not adversely criticized, there was not much enthusiasm elicited by this debut. In his first season at the Metropolitan opera, Melchior sang only eight times. His second season brought only one appearance. To build up his repertory and gain more stage experience, he accepted an engagement at the Hamburg State Opera, where he appeared as Lohengrin, Otello, Radames in &quot;Aida&quot; and Jean van Leyden in &quot;Le prophète&quot;. He also sang regularly at other major German music theaters, like the State Operas of Berlin and Munich.

Although Melchior sang at most of the theatres and concert halls of the Western world during his long career, he is perhaps best remembered as a member of the Metropolitan Opera company, where he sang 519 performances of Wagnerian roles between 1926 and 1950. Melchior&#x27;s breakthrough at the Metropolitan Opera finally came when he performed in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; on March 20, 1929. From this point on, his career flourished.

Melchior appeared at Covent Garden from 1924 to 1939, also as Otello (opposite Viorica Ursuleac as Desdemona) and Florestan, besides the Wagnerian repertory. Also at Covent Garden in 1932, he sang opposite popular soprano Florence Easton in &quot;Siegfried&quot;, the only time they appeared together. Other important stations of his career were in the Buenos Aires (Teatro Colón) (1931–1943), San Francisco Opera (1934–1945) and Chicago Opera (1934–1945). It was Lohengrin&#x27;s Farewell that served as Melchior&#x27;s &quot;swan song&quot; in his last stage performance, on February 2, 1950.

Some of Melchior&#x27;s most notable colleagues in the opera houses of the world included the sopranos Frida Leider, Kirsten Flagstad, Lotte Lehmann, Helen Traubel, Marjorie Lawrence, and Elisabeth Rethberg, and conductors Felix Weingartner, Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Fritz Reiner, Sir Thomas Beecham, Arturo Toscanini, Erich Leinsdorf, George Szell, and Otto Klemperer.

He played contract bridge, and holds the world record for the lowest score (13%) secured in a duplicate bridge tournament.

===Moving in new directions===
Between 1944 and 1952, Melchior performed in five Hollywood musical films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures and made numerous US radio and television appearances. In 1947, he put his hand and footprints in cement in the forecourt of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.

From 1946 to 1949, Melchior went on a world tour with his personal conductor Ezra Rachlin. Their visit to Denmark was particularly meaningful as they were the guests of King Frederik IX, who was an amateur conductor with his own personal concert hall in his palace.

In 1952, Melchior performed at New York&#x27;s Palace Theatre, following the popular singer-actress Judy Garland, after she set a record-breaking vaudeville engagement there which lasted nineteen weeks.

Following unofficial retirement circa 1955, Melchior made sporadic singing appearances. On occasion, he sang the national anthem at Dodgers baseball games in Los Angeles, such as Game 3 of the 1963 World Series. In the late 1960s, he established a fund through the Juilliard School for the training of potential heldentenors called &quot;The Lauritz Melchior Heldentenor Foundation.&quot;

In the 1960s, he made at least one television appearance on &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;, where he sang with Shirley Jones in the role of her father, to assist her entry into show business.

In the summer of 1972, Melchior conducted the San Francisco Opera Orchestra at Sigmund Stern Grove in the &quot;Radetzky March&quot; by Johann Strauss I as part of the 50th anniversary celebration of the company. This was one of his last public appearances.

===Victim of robbery===
On June 18, 1957, three men (Richard McFall, Wayne Burke and Alfred J. Pope) forcibly entered Melchior&#x27;s Los Angeles home and tied/bound four victims (Melchior, his wife and two servants) before fleeing with an estimated value of $100,000 in cash, jewels, furs and other personal property. The three robbers were told of the valuables by a former Melchior chauffeur, Louis J. Spivak, who was to receive a 1/3 share of the booty.

===Death===

An American citizen since 1947, Melchior died in Santa Monica, California in 1973, two days before his 83rd birthday. He was put to rest in the Assistens Kirkegaard cemetery in Copenhagen. He was survived by his son, Danish-American novelist and filmmaker Ib Melchior, who wrote a biography of his father and for years fought a legal battle to reclaim the Melchior family estate Chossewitz in Germany, which was confiscated by East Germany.

==Recordings==
Melchior made many recordings, first as a baritone on Danish HMV, then as a tenor for Deutsche Grammophon (Polydor) (1923–1930), English and German HMV (1927–1935), RCA Victor (1938–1941), American Columbia (1942–1950) and lastly Warner Bros. His final appearance with Danish radio was in 1960 with a performance of the first act of &quot;Die Walküre&quot; to celebrate his 70th birthday, which was released as a recording.

<text>Our Lady of Guadalupe (), also known as the Virgin of Guadalupe (), is a Catholic title of the Blessed Virgin Mary associated with four Marian apparitions to Juan Diego and one to his uncle, Juan Bernardino reported in December 1531, when the Mexican territories were part of the Spanish Empire.

A venerated image on a cloak (&quot;tilmahtli&quot;) associated with the apparition is enshrined in the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City. 

Pope Leo XIII granted a decree of canonical coronation for the image on 8 February 1887. The rite of coronation was executed by the former Archbishop of Mexico, Próspero Alarcón y Sánchez de la Barquera on 12 October 1895. Pope Paul VI raised the shrine to the status of Minor Basilica via his Pontifical decree titled &quot;Sacra illa Ædes&quot; on 6 October 1976 and is the most-visited Catholic shrine in the world, and the world&#x27;s third most-visited sacred site.

== Description of Marian apparitions ==
According to the &quot;Nican Mopohua&quot;, included in the 17th-century &quot;Huei tlamahuiçoltica&quot;, written in Nahuatl, the Virgin Mary appeared four times to Juan Diego, a Chichimec peasant, and once to his uncle, Juan Bernardino. The first apparition occurred on the morning of Saturday, December 9, 1531 (Julian calendar, which is December 19 on the (proleptic) Gregorian calendar in present use). Juan Diego experienced a vision of a young woman at a place called the Hill of Tepeyac, which later became part of Villa de Guadalupe, in a suburb of Mexico City.

According to the accounts, the woman, speaking to Juan Diego in Nahuatl, his first language and the language of the former Aztec Empire, identified herself as the Mary, &quot;mother of the very true deity&quot;. She was said to have asked for a church to be erected at that site in her honor.

Based on her words, Juan Diego then sought the Archbishop of Mexico City, Juan de Zumárraga, to tell him what had happened. Not unexpectedly, the Archbishop did not believe Diego. Later the same day, Juan Diego saw the young woman again (the second apparition), and she asked him to continue insisting.

The next day, Sunday, December 10, 1531, in the Julian calendar, Juan Diego spoke to the Archbishop a second time. The latter instructed him to return to Tepeyac and to ask the woman for a truly acceptable, miraculous sign to prove her identity. Later that day, the third apparition appeared when Juan Diego returned to Tepeyac; encountering the same woman, he reported to her the Archbishop&#x27;s request for a sign, which she consented to provide on the next day (December 11).

On Monday, December 11, however, Juan Diego’s uncle fell ill and he was obliged to attend to him. In the early hours of Tuesday, December 12, as Juan Bernardino&#x27;s condition deteriorated, Juan Diego journeyed to Tlatelolco in search of a Catholic priest to hear Juan Bernardino&#x27;s confession and help minister to him on his deathbed.

To avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around Tepeyac Hill, yet the Virgin intercepted him and asked where he was going (fourth apparition); Juan Diego explained what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having made recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe apparitions and are inscribed above the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked &quot;¿No estoy yo aquí que soy tu madre?&quot; (&quot;Am I not here, I who am your mother?&quot;). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and told him to gather flowers from the summit of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in the cold of December. Juan Diego obeyed her instruction and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there.

According to the story, the Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan Diego&#x27;s &quot;tilmàtli&quot; or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak later that day before Archbishop Zumárraga, the flowers fell to the floor, revealing on the fabric the image of the Virgin.

The next day, December 13, Juan Diego found his uncle fully recovered as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted that he also had seen her after praying at his bedside (fifth apparition); that she had instructed him to inform the Archbishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; and that she had told him she desired to be known under the title of &quot;Guadalupe&quot;.

The Archbishop kept Juan Diego&#x27;s mantle, first in his private chapel and then in the church on public display, where it attracted great attention. On December 26, 1531, a procession formed to transfer the miraculous image back to Tepeyac Hill where it was installed in a small, hastily erected chapel. During this procession, the first miracle was allegedly performed when a native was mortally wounded in the neck by an arrow shot by accident during some stylized martial displays performed in honor of the Virgin. In great distress, the natives carried him before the Virgin&#x27;s image and pleaded for his life. Upon the arrow being withdrawn, the victim fully and immediately recovered.

== History ==
===Origin in Guadalupe, Spain===

The shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe in Guadalupe, Cáceres, in Extremadura, Spain, was the most important of the shrines to the Virgin Mary in the medieval Kingdom of Castile. It is one of the many Black Madonnas in Spain and is revered in the Monastery of Santa María de Guadalupe, in the town of Guadalupe, from which numerous Spanish conquistadors stem.

The most popular etymology of the name &quot;Guadalupe&quot; is from the Arabic &quot;Wadi&quot; (river) and the Latin word &quot;lupus&quot; (wolf). Some find it unlikely that Arabic and Latin would be combined in this way, and suggest as an alternative the Arabic &quot;Wadi-al-lub&quot;, signifying a river with black stones in its bed.

The shrine houses a statue reputed to have been carved by Luke the Evangelist and given to Archbishop Leander of Seville by Pope Gregory I. According to local legend, when Seville was taken by the Moors in 712, a group of priests fled northward and buried the statue in the hills near the Guadalupe River.

At the beginning of the 14th century, the Virgin appeared one day to a humble cowboy named Gil Cordero who was searching for a missing animal in the mountains. Cordero claimed that Mary had appeared to him and ordered him to ask priests to dig at the site of the apparition. Excavating priests rediscovered the hidden statue and built a small shrine around it which became the great Guadalupe monastery.

===Origin in Mexico===

Following the Conquest in 1519–1521, the Marian cult was brought to the Americas and Franciscan friars often leveraged syncretism with existing religious beliefs as an instrument for evangelization. What is purported by some to be the earliest mention of the miraculous apparition of the Virgin is a page of parchment, the &quot;Codex Escalada&quot; from 1548, which was discovered in 1995 and, according to investigative analysis, dates from the sixteenth century. This document bears two pictorial representations of Juan Diego and the apparition, several inscriptions in Nahuatl referring to Juan Diego by his Aztec name, and the date of his death: 1548, as well as the year that the then named Virgin Mary appeared: 1531. It also contains the glyph of Antonio Valeriano; and finally, the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagun which was authenticated by experts from the Banco de Mexico and Charles E. Dibble. Historians Alberto Peralta and Stafford Poole questioned the authenticity of the document.
A more complete early description of the apparition occurs in a 16-page manuscript called the &quot;Nican mopohua&quot;, which has been reliably dated in 1556 and was acquired by the New York Public Library in 1880. This document, written in Nahuatl, tells the story of the apparitions and the supernatural origin of the image. It was probably composed by a native Aztec man, Antonio Valeriano, who had been educated by Franciscans. The text of this document was later incorporated into a printed pamphlet which was widely circulated in 1649.

In spite of these documents, there are no known 16th century written accounts of the Guadalupe vision by the archbishop Juan de Zumárraga. In particular, the canonical account of the vision features archbishop Juan de Zumárraga as a major player in the story, but, although Zumárraga was a prolific writer, there is nothing in his extant writings that can confirm the indigenous story.

The written record suggests the Catholic clergy in 16th century Mexico were deeply divided as to the orthodoxy of the native beliefs springing up around the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, with the Franciscan order (who then had custody of the chapel at Tepeyac) being strongly opposed to the outside groups, while the Dominicans supported it.

The main promoter of the story was the Dominican Alonso de Montúfar, who succeeded the Franciscan Juan de Zumárraga as archbishop of Mexico. In a 1556 sermon Montúfar commended popular devotion to &quot;Our Lady of Guadalupe&quot;, referring to a painting on cloth (the tilma) in the chapel of the Virgin Mary at Tepeyac, where certain miracles had also occurred. Days later, Fray Francisco de Bustamante, local head of the Franciscan order, delivered a sermon denouncing the native belief and believers. He expressed concern that the Catholic Archbishop was promoting a superstitious regard for an indigenous image:

The devotion at the chapel... to which they have given the name Guadalupe was prejudicial to the Indians because they believed that the image itself worked miracles, contrary to what the missionary friars had been teaching them, and because many were disappointed when it did not.

Archbishop Montúfar opened an inquiry into the matter at which the Franciscans repeated their position that the image encouraged idolatry and superstition, and four witnesses testified to Bustamante&#x27;s statement that the image was painted by an Indian, with one witness naming him &quot;the Indian painter Marcos&quot;. This could refer to the Aztec painter Marcos Cipac de Aquino, who was active at that time. A document called &quot;Informaciones 1556&quot; and published in 1888 states that on September 8, 1556, the feast of the Nativity of Mary, at the end of the sermon that Bustamante gave in the chapel of San José in the convent of San Francisco in Mexico, Bustamante attacked Archbishop Montúfar for having, according to the former, encouraged a devotion that had arisen around an image “painted yesterday by the Indian Marcos.”

Prof. Jody Brant Smith, referring to Philip Serna Callahan&#x27;s examination of the tilma using infrared photography in 1979, wrote: &quot;if Marcos did, he apparently did so without making a preliminary sketches – in itself then seen as a near-miraculous procedure... Cipac may well have had a hand in painting the Image, but only in painting the additions, such as the angel and moon at the Virgin&#x27;s feet.&quot;

Ultimately Archbishop Montúfar, himself a Dominican, decided to end Franciscan custody of the shrine. From then on the shrine was kept and served by diocesan priests under the authority of the archbishop. Moreover, Archbishop Montúfar authorized the construction of a much larger church at Tepeyac, in which the tilma was later mounted and displayed.

In the late 1570s, the Franciscan historian Bernardino de Sahagún denounced the cult at Tepeyac and the use of the name &quot;Tonantzin&quot; or to call her Our Lady in a personal digression in his &quot;General History of the Things of New Spain&quot;, also known as the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot;:

At this place [Tepeyac], [the Indians] had a temple dedicated to the mother of the gods, whom they called Tonantzin, which means Our Mother. There they performed many sacrifices in honor of this goddess ... And now that a church of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built there, they also called her Tonantzin, being motivated by those preachers who called Our Lady, the Mother of God, Tonantzin. While it is not known for certain where the beginning of Tonantzin may have originated, but this we know for certain, that, from its first usage, the word refers to the ancient Tonantzin. And it was viewed as something that should be remedied, for their having [native] name of the Mother of God, Holy Mary, instead of Tonantzin, but &quot;Dios inantzin&quot;. It appears to be a Satanic invention to cloak idolatry under the confusion of this name, Tonantzin. And they now come to visit from very far away, as far away as before, which is also suspicious, because everywhere there are many churches of Our Lady and they do not go to them. They come from distant lands to this Tonantzin as in olden times.

Sahagún&#x27;s criticism of the indigenous group seems to have stemmed primarily from his concern about a syncretistic application of the native name &quot;Tonantzin&quot; to the Catholic Virgin Mary. However, Sahagún often used the same name in his sermons as late as the 1560s.

===First printed accounts in Mexico===

One of the first printed accounts of the history of the apparitions and image occurs in &quot;Imagen de la Virgen Maria, Madre de Dios de Guadalupe&quot;, published in 1648 by Miguel Sánchez, a diocesan priest of Mexico City.

Another account is the Codex Escalada, dating from the sixteenth century, a sheet of parchment recording apparitions of the Virgin Mary and the figure of Juan Diego, which reproduces the glyph of Antonio Valeriano alongside the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagún. It contains the following glosses: &quot;1548 Also in that year of 1531 appeared to Cuahtlatoatzin our beloved mother the Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico. Cuahtlatoatzin died worthily&quot;

The next printed account was a 36-page tract in the Nahuatl language, &quot;Huei tlamahuiçoltica&quot; (&quot;The Great Event&quot;), which was published in 1649. This tract contains a section called the &quot;Nican mopohua&quot; (&quot;Here it is recounted&quot;), which has been already touched on above. The composition and authorship of the &quot;Huei tlamahuiçoltica&quot; is assigned by a majority of those scholars to Luis Laso de la Vega, vicar of the sanctuary of Tepeyac from 1647 to 1657.
Nevertheless, the most important section of the tract, the &quot;Nican Mopohua&quot;, appears to be much older. It has been attributed since the late 1600s to Antonio Valeriano (c. 1531–1605), a native Aztec man who had been educated by the Franciscans and who collaborated extensively with Bernardino de Sahagún.
A manuscript version of the &quot;Nican Mopohua&quot;, which is now held by the New York Public Library,
appears to be dated to c. 1556, and may have been the original work by Valeriano, as that was used by Laso in composing the &quot;Huei tlamahuiçoltica&quot;. Most authorities agree on the dating and on Valeriano&#x27;s authorship. According to the skeptic and investigator of the paranormal, Joe Nickell, if the main source, the &quot;Huei tlamahuiçoltica&quot;, was published in 1649, the legend it narrates date to after that time. 

On the other hand, in 1666, the scholar Luis Becerra Tanco published in Mexico a book about the history of the apparitions under the name , which was republished in Spain in 1675 as . In the same way, in 1688, Jesuit Father Francisco de Florencia published &quot;La Estrella del Norte de México&quot;, giving the history of the same apparitions.

Two separate accounts, one in Nahuatl from Juan Bautista del Barrio de San Juan from the 16th century, and the other in Spanish by Servando Teresa de Mier date the original apparition and native celebration on September 8 of the Julian calendar, but the latter also says that the Spaniards celebrate it on December 12 instead.

According to the document &quot;Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666&quot;, a Catholic feast day in name of Our Lady of Guadalupe was requested and approved, as well as the transfer of the date of the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe from September 8 to December 12, the latest date on which the Virgin supposedly appeared to Juan Diego. The initiative to perform them was made by Francisco de Siles who proposed to ask the Church of Rome, a Mass itself with allusive text to the apparitions and stamping of the image, along with the divine office itself, and the precept of hearing a Catholic Mass on December 12, the last date of the apparitions of the Virgin to Juan Diego as the new date to commemorate the apparitions (which until then was on September 8, the birth of the Virgin).

In 1666, the Church in México began gathering information from people who reported having known Juan Diego, and in 1723 a formal investigation into his life was ordered, where more data was gathered to support his veneration. Because of the &quot;Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666&quot; in the year 1754, the Sacred Congregation of Rites confirmed the true and valid value of the apparitions, and granted celebrating Mass and Office for the then Catholic version of the feast of Guadalupe on December 12.

These published accounts of the origin of the image already venerated in Tepeyac, then increased interest in the identity of Juan Diego, who was the original recipient of the prime vision. A new Catholic Basilica church was built to house the image. Completed in 1709, it is now known as the Old Basilica.

===The crown ornament===

The image had originally featured a 12-point crown on the Virgin&#x27;s head, but this disappeared in 1887–88. The change was first noticed on February 23, 1888, when the image was removed to a nearby church. Eventually a painter confessed on his deathbed that he had been instructed by a clergyman to remove the crown. This may have been motivated by the fact that the gold paint was flaking off of the crown, leaving it looking dilapidated. But according to the historian David Brading, &quot;the decision to remove rather than replace the crown was no doubt inspired by a desire to &#x27;modernize&#x27; the image and reinforce its similarity to the nineteenth-century images of the Immaculate Conception which were exhibited at Lourdes and elsewhere... What is rarely mentioned is that the frame which surrounded the canvas was adjusted to leave almost no space above the Virgin&#x27;s head, thereby obscuring the effects of the erasure.&quot;

A different crown was installed to the image. On February 8, 1887, a Papal bull from Pope Leo XIII granted permission a Canonical Coronation of the image, which occurred on October 12, 1895.

=== 20th century ===

Since then the Virgin of Guadalupe has been proclaimed &quot;Queen of Mexico&quot;, &quot;Patroness of the Americas&quot;, &quot;Empress of Latin America&quot;, and &quot;Protectress of Unborn Children&quot; (the latter two titles given by Pope John Paul II in 1999).

On November 14, 1921, a bomb hidden within a basket of flowers and left under the tilma by an anti-Catholic secularist exploded and damaged the altar of the Basilica that houses the original image, but the tilma was unharmed. A brass standing crucifix, bent by the explosion, is now preserved at the shrine&#x27;s museum and is believed to be miraculous by devotees.

==The beatification of Juan Diego==

Under Pope John Paul II the move to beatify Juan Diego intensified. John Paul II took a special interest in non-European Catholics and saints. During his leadership, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared Juan Diego &quot;venerable&quot; (in 1987), and the pope himself announced his beatification on May 6, 1990, during a Mass at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, declaring him &quot;protector and advocate of the indigenous peoples&quot;, with December 9 established as his feast day.

At that time historians revived doubts as to the quality of the evidence regarding Juan Diego. The writings of bishop Zumárraga, into whose hands Juan purportedly delivered the miraculous image, did not refer to him or the event. The record of the 1556 ecclesiastical inquiry omitted him, and he was not mentioned in documentation before the mid-17th century. In 1996 the 83-year-old abbot of the Basilica of Guadalupe, Guillermo Schulenburg, was forced to resign following an interview published in the Catholic magazine &quot;Ixthus,&quot; in which he was quoted as saying that Juan Diego was &quot;a symbol, not a reality&quot;, and that his canonization would be the &quot;recognition of a cult. It is not recognition of the physical, real existence of a person.&quot; In 1883 Joaquín García Icazbalceta, historian and biographer of Zumárraga, in a confidential report on the Lady of Guadalupe for Bishop Labastida, had been hesitant to support the story of the vision. He concluded that Juan Diego had not existed.

In 1995, Father Xavier Escalada, a Jesuit whose four volume Guadalupe encyclopedia had just been published, announced the existence of a sheet of parchment (known as &quot;Codex Escalada&quot;), which bore an illustrated account of the vision and some notations in Nahuatl concerning the life and death of Juan Diego. Previously unknown, the document was dated 1548. It bore the signatures of Antonio Valeriano and Bernardino de Sahagún, which are considered to verify its contents. The codex was the subject of an appendix to the Guadalupe encyclopedia, published in 1997. Some scholars remained unconvinced, one describing the discovery of the Codex as &quot;rather like finding a picture of St. Paul&#x27;s vision of Christ on the road to Damascus, drawn by St. Luke and signed by St. Peter.&quot;

== Marian title ==

In the earliest account of the apparition, the &quot;Nican Mopohua&quot;, the Virgin de Guadalupe, later called as if the Virgin Mary tells Juan Bernardino, the uncle of Juan Diego, that the image left on the tilma is to be known by the name &quot;the Perfect Virgin, Holy Mary of Guadalupe&quot;.

There have been various efforts to find a pre-Hispanic origin in the cult, including attempts to find a Nahuatl etymology to the name. The first theory to promote this Nahuatl origin was that of Luis Becerra Tanco. In his 1675 work &quot;Felicidad de Mexico&quot;, Becerra Tanco said that Juan Bernardino and Juan Diego would not have been able to understand the name Guadalupe because the &quot;d&quot; and &quot;g&quot; sounds do not exist in Nahuatl.

He proposed two Nahuatl alternative names that sound similar to &quot;Guadalupe&quot;, &quot;Tecuatlanopeuh&quot; , which he translates as &quot;she whose origins were in the rocky summit&quot;, and &quot;Tecuantlaxopeuh&quot; , &quot;she who banishes those who devoured us.&quot;

Ondina and Justo González suggest that the name is a Spanish version of the Nahuatl term, &quot;Coātlaxopeuh&quot; , which they interpret as meaning &quot;the one who crushes the serpent&quot;, and that it may seem to be referring to the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl. In addition, the Virgin Mary was portrayed in European art as crushing the serpent of the Garden of Eden.

Sahagún claimed that the Aztecs had previously worshiped the goddess Tonantzin (sometimes identified with Coatlícue or Cihuacoatl) at Tepeyac. He believed that the shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe allowed them to continue their worship of Tonantzin, since they neglected other Marian shrines to come to Tepeyac.

The theory promoting the Spanish origin of the name says that:
* Juan Diego and Juan Bernardino would have been familiar with the Spanish &quot;g&quot; and &quot;d&quot; sounds since their baptismal names contain those sounds.
* There is no documentation of any other name for this Marian apparition during the almost 144 years between the apparition being recorded in 1531 and Becerra Tanco&#x27;s proposed theory in 1675.
* Documents written by contemporary Spaniards and Franciscan friars argue that for the name to be changed to a native name, such as &quot;Tepeaca&quot; or &quot;Tepeaquilla,&quot; would not make sense to them, if a Nahuatl name were already in use, and suggest the Spanish &quot;Guadalupe&quot; was the original.

==Venerated image and Diego&#x27;s &quot;tilma&quot;==

=== Description ===
The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is of a life-sized, dark-haired, olive-skinned young woman, standing with her head slightly inclined to her right, eyes downcast, and her hands held before her in prayer. She wears a pink dress ornamented with a floral design, a dark ribbon tied above her waist, and a blue-green mantle over all. The mantle is edged with gold and has golden stars throughout. She stands on a crescent moon, which is supported by an angel with eagle wings. She is surrounded by a golden sunburst.

The tilma now measures approximately 1.72 meters by 1.07 meters, though sources vary by a few centimeters, and it shows signs of having been trimmed from the original size. It is made of two pieces of fabric sewn together with cotton thread. There is a large crack running vertically through the middle of the image, as well as smaller horizontal cracks, caused by the image being folded at some point.

The image is currently housed in a golden frame above the main altar of the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, where it has been since the new basilica was completed in 1976.

===Symbolism===
The iconography of the Virgin is fully Catholic: Miguel Sánchez, the author of the 1648 tract &quot;Imagen de la Virgen María&quot;, described her as the Woman of the Apocalypse from the New Testament&#x27;s Revelation 12:1, &quot;clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.&quot; She is described as a representation of the Immaculate Conception.

&lt;section begin=Alleged corruption in the Catholic Church transclusion/&gt;Virgil Elizondo says the image also had layers of meaning for the indigenous people of Mexico who associated her image with their polytheistic deities, which further contributed to her popularity. Her blue-green mantle was the color reserved for the divine couple Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl; her belt is interpreted as a sign of pregnancy; and a cross-shaped image, symbolizing the cosmos and called &quot;nahui-ollin,&quot; is inscribed beneath the image&#x27;s sash. She was called &quot;mother of maguey&quot;, the source of the sacred beverage pulque. Pulque was also known as &quot;the milk of the Virgin&quot;. The rays of light surrounding her are seen to also represent maguey spines.

===Technical analyses===
The image and &quot;tilma&quot; have been examined numerous times over the years.

====Capitular inquiry====
In 1662, canons of the cathedral in Mexico City began the process of asking for a proper liturgy for Our Lady of Guadalupe on December 12. As part of this request, Rome asked for a canonical investigation into the apparitions. The canons carried out this investigation from 1665–1666, including an examination of the image in March 1666.

On March 13, 1666, seven painters examined the image, accompanied by the viceroy and several clerics. The painters unanimously agreed that it was &quot;impossible that any artist could paint and work something so beautiful, clean, and well-formed on a fabric which is as rough as is the &quot;tilma&quot;&quot;, and that the image must therefore be miraculous. They also noted the degree of preservation of the image and &quot;tilma&quot;, and that the &quot;tilma&quot; had not been prepared for painting.

On March 28, three members of the &quot;protomédico&quot; of New Spain also examined the image. They also noted how well-preserved the image was given the local climate, and saw this as evidence of the image&#x27;s supernatural origin. In contrast, the silver of the moon and the gold on the sunburst, which had both been added to the original, were faded.

====Cabrera====
On April 30, 1751, a group of eight painters headed by José de Ibarra were allowed to examine the image. On April 15, 1752, one of the painters, Miguel Cabrera, was again allowed access to the image in order to create three copies. In 1756, Cabrera published his account of the image, approved by the other painters, entitled &quot;Maravilla Americana&quot;.

Like the previous report, Cabrera noted the preservation of the image despite the climate. He said that the &quot;tilma&quot; was two pieces of cloth sewn together, and that it felt soft, probably made of &quot;ayate&quot; fibers rather than the coarser &quot;maguey&quot;, as others had claimed. He discovered signs of four different painting techniques which he claimed had never been used in combination before. He said that the image had not been sized, and thus the image could be seen through the back of the cloth, though all but a small portion of the back was covered with silver at the time.

====Bartolache====
In 1787, another group of painters examined the image at the request of , a doctor and mathematician. They confirmed Cabrera&#x27;s opinion that the fabric of the &quot;tilma&quot; was not coarse, but determined that it was of palm fibers. Contrary to Cabrera, however, they claimed that the image had been sized beforehand, and was not visible from behind; however, four years later, two of the painters claimed that they had never seen the back of the image and did not know if it had been sized. The artists came to the conclusion that the parts of the image that were original were of divine origin, though they noted that there were some touch-ups that were clearly the work of human hands, the first study to so note.

====Flores Gómez====
Art restorer José Antonio Flores Gómez was hired by the abbot of the basilica to work on the image in 1947 and 1973. In a 2002 interview with the magazine &quot;Proceso&quot;, he spoke about his experience. He noted that he had not been required to keep silent about his work, but had done so of his own accord.

When he examined the image in 1947, he saw a large crack in the paint running vertically through the middle of the image, as well as some smaller horizontal cracks, which he thought were caused by the image having been folded. He also saw signs that others had touched up the image at various points. The necessity of touching up the image convinced him that it was of human origin.

Like others, Flores Gómez noted the softness of the &quot;tilma&quot;, which seemed to him more like cotton than the rougher agave traditionally claimed. He also said that the paints used in the image came from natural pigments, such as from the cochineal.

====Callahan and Smith====
In 1981, Philip Serna Callahan and Jody Brant Smith examined the image under infrared light, a common technique in art analysis. They were unable to find any trace of sizing or sketching underneath the paint. They concluded that, while there had been additions to and touch-ups of the image, which were in a poor state, there was no explanation for the original parts of the image or their preservation.

====Sol Rosales====
In 1982, Guillermo Schulenburg, abbot of the basilica, hired José Sol Rosales of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura to study the image. Sol Rosales thought that the &quot;tilma&quot; was made of linen and hemp, and not either agave or cotton. Contrary to previous claims, he said that the fabric had been prepared with white paint before the image had been painted. He saw several different styles of tempera throughout the image. He held that the paints were made from various natural pigments, and further noted that all of these pigments were commonly available in 16th-century Mexico. Like Flores Gómez, Sol Rosales saw various touch-ups and repainting throughout the image.

Sol Rosales concluded that the image was of human origin. He claimed that others, like Cabrera, had had similar findings, but concluded that the image was divine due to social pressures. Sol Rosales and his team were supervised during the investigation by Schulenburg and others. Schulenburg sent the results of this study to the Vatican, cautioning against the canonization of Juan Diego.

====Studies on the eyes====
Several studies have examined the eyes of the image. The authors of these studies claim that they have found images in the eyes corresponding to the people believed to have been present when Juan Diego opened his &quot;tilma&quot; before the bishop. The eyes are also claimed to contain Purkinje images exactly where they would be expected to be found in living eyes.

Critics of these studies liken the figures to inkblots in which proponents see what they hope to see.

==Cultural significance==
Juan Diego&#x27;s tilma has become Mexico&#x27;s most popular religious and cultural symbol, and has received widespread ecclesiastical and popular veneration. In the 19th century it became the rallying cry of the Spaniards born in America, in what they denominated &#x27;New Spain&#x27;. They said they considered the apparitions as legitimizing their own indigenous Mexican origin. They infused it with an almost messianic sense of mission and identity, thereby also justifying their armed rebellion against Spain.

===Symbol of Mexico===
&quot;Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe&quot; became a recognized symbol of Catholic Mexicans. Miguel Sánchez, the author in 1648 of the first published account of the vision, identified Guadalupe as &quot;Revelation&#x27;s&quot; Woman of the Apocalypse, and said:

... this New World has been won and conquered by the hand of the Virgin Mary ... who had prepared, disposed, and contrived her exquisite likeness in this, her Mexican land, which was conquered for such a glorious purpose, won that there should appear so Mexican an image.

Throughout the Mexican national history of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Guadalupan name and image have been unifying national symbols; the first President of Mexico (1824–1829) changed his name from José Miguel Ramón Adaucto Fernández y Félix to Guadalupe Victoria in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Father Miguel Hidalgo, in the Mexican War of Independence (1810), and Emiliano Zapata, in the Mexican Revolution (1910), led their respective armed forces with Guadalupan flags emblazoned with an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. In 1999, the Church officially proclaimed her the &quot;Patroness of the Americas&quot;, the &quot;Empress of Latin America&quot;, and the &quot;Protectress of Unborn Children&quot;.

In 1810, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla initiated the bid for Mexican independence with his &quot;Grito de Dolores&quot;, with the cry &quot;Death to the Spaniards and long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!&quot; When Hidalgo&#x27;s mestizo-indigenous army attacked Guanajuato and Valladolid, they placed &quot;the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which was the insignia of their enterprise, on sticks or on reeds painted different colors&quot; and &quot;they all wore a print of the Virgin on their hats.&quot; After Hidalgo&#x27;s death, leadership of the revolution fell to a mestizo priest named José María Morelos, who led insurgent troops in the Mexican south. Morelos adopted the Virgin as the seal of his Congress of Chilpancingo, inscribing her feast day into the Chilpancingo constitution and declaring that Guadalupe was the power behind his victories:

New Spain puts less faith in its own efforts than in the power of God and the intercession of its Blessed Mother, who appeared within the precincts of Tepeyac as the miraculous image of Guadalupe that had come to comfort us, defend us, visibly be our protection.

Simón Bolívar noticed the Guadalupan theme in these uprisings, and shortly before Morelos&#x27;s execution in 1815 wrote: &quot;the leaders of the independence struggle have put fanaticism to use by proclaiming the famous Virgin of Guadalupe as the queen of the patriots, praying to her in times of hardship and displaying her on their flags... the veneration for this image in Mexico far exceeds the greatest reverence that the shrewdest prophet might inspire.&quot;

In 1912, Emiliano Zapata&#x27;s peasant army rose out of the south against the government of Francisco Madero. Though Zapata&#x27;s rebel forces were primarily interested in land reform—&quot;tierra y libertad&quot; (&#x27;land and liberty&#x27;) was the slogan of the uprising—when his peasant troops penetrated Mexico City, they carried Guadalupan banners. More recently, the contemporary Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) named their &quot;mobile city&quot; in honor of the Virgin: it is called Guadalupe Tepeyac. EZLN spokesperson Subcomandante Marcos wrote a humorous letter in 1995 describing the EZLN bickering over what to do with a Guadalupe statue they had received as a gift.

===Mexican culture===

Harringon argues that: The Aztecs... had an elaborate, coherent symbolic system for making sense of their lives. When this was destroyed by the Spaniards, something new was needed to fill the void and make sense of New Spain ... the image of Guadalupe served that purpose.
According to the traditional account, the name of Guadalupe, as the name was heard or understood by Spaniards, was chosen by the Virgin herself when she appeared on the hill outside Mexico City in 1531, ten years after the Conquest.

Guadalupe continues to be a mixture of the cultures which blended to form Mexico, both racially and religiously, &quot;the first mestiza&quot;, or &quot;the first Mexican&quot;, &quot;bringing together people of distinct cultural heritages, while at the same time affirming their distinctness.&quot; As Jacques Lafaye wrote in &quot;Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe&quot;, &quot;as the Christians built their first churches with the rubble and the columns of the ancient pagan temples, so they often borrowed pagan customs for their own cult purposes.&quot; The author Judy King asserts that Guadalupe is a &quot;common denominator&quot; uniting Mexicans. Writing that Mexico is composed of a vast patchwork of differences—linguistic, ethnic, and class-based—King says &quot;The Virgin of Guadalupe is the rubber band that binds this disparate nation into a whole.&quot;
The Mexican novelist, Carlos Fuentes, once said that &quot;you cannot truly be considered a Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe.&quot; Nobel Literature laureate Octavio Paz wrote in 1974 that &quot;The Mexican people, after more than two centuries of experiments and defeats, have faith only in the Virgin of Guadalupe and the National Lottery.&quot;

==Veneration==
The shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe is the most visited Catholic pilgrimage destination in the world. Over the Friday and Saturday of December 11 to 12, 2009, a record number of 6.1 million pilgrims visited the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City to commemorate the anniversary of the apparition.

Religious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe appears in Roman Catholic parishes, especially those with Latin American heritage. &lt;section end=Alleged corruption in the Catholic Church transclusion/&gt;In addition, due to the growth of Hispanic communities in the United States, religious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe has started appearing in some Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist churches. 

The Virgin of Guadalupe is considered the Patroness of Mexico and the Continental Americas; she is also venerated by Native Americans, on the account of the devotion calling for the conversion of the Americas. 

Due to Mary&#x27;s appearance as a pregnant mother and her claims as mother of all in the apparition, the Blessed Virgin Mary, under this title is popularly invoked as &quot;Patroness of the Unborn&quot; and a common image for the Pro-Life movement.

===Pontifical approbations===
* Pope Benedict XIV, in the papal bull &quot;Non est Equidem&quot; of May 25, 1754, declared Our Lady of Guadalupe patroness of what was then named &quot;New Spain&quot;, corresponding to Spanish Central and Northern America, and included liturgical texts for the Catholic Mass and the Roman Breviary in her honor.
* Pope Leo XIII granted a decree of coronation towards the original Mexican relic on February 8, 1887, which was carried out on October 12, 1895.
* Pope Pius X declared her patroness of the Republic of Mexico on June 16, 1910, via decree &quot;Gratia quae&quot;, signed and notarized by Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val. 
* Pope Pius XII mentioned the venerated image via public radio address honoring its fiftieth anniversary of coronation on October 12, 1945. 
* Pope Paul VI granted the image a Golden Rose on March 20, 1966, and consigned it to Cardinal Carlo Confalonieri as his legate, who presented it at the Basilica on May 31, 1966.
* Pope John Paul II:
** Visited her shrine on January 27, 1979, on his first trip as pope. He was the first pope to visit the shrine. He visited again in 1990, 1999, and 2002.
**On May 12, 1992, he dedicated a namesake chapel within the grottoes under Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica at the Vatican.

** Granted a new golden crown to the image during his apostolic visit to the Basilica on February 13, 2016.

== In political movements ==
Due to her association as a crusader of social justice, the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe has been utilized as a symbol across regions to advance political movements and mobilize the masses. For instance, the image has most notably been utilized in Mexico&#x27;s Independence movement in the early 19th century, the United Farm Worker Movement in the U.S. in the 20th century and in contemporary political causes like immigration.

In Mexico&#x27;s Independence, the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe became associated with the movement after Father Miguel Hidalgo rallied and united insurgents under her banner. In fact, the first president of the Mexican republic, José Miguel Ramón Adaucto Fernández y Félix, who was heavily involved in Mexico&#x27;s Independence war, changed his name as to Guadalupe Victoria as a sign of devotion.

In the United Farm Workers Union (UFW), its leader, Cesar Chavez, was a devout Catholic who drew on his religious beliefs to demand for better wages and labor practices for farm workers in the U.S. He incorporated his religious beliefs in the movement by holding masses in the picket lines and prayers before meetings, and leading a pilgrimage from Delano to Sacramento in 1966 during Lent. Similarly to Mexico&#x27;s Independence movement, the famous pilgrimage in 1966 that drew national attention to the cause was lead under a banner with the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is also present in the contemporary political discussion on immigration. Artists like Ester Hernandez and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood embed or reimagine her image on artworks that comment on immigration politics. For instance, Ester Hernandez&#x27;s screen print titled &quot;Wanted&quot; (2010) and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Jump&quot; (1994) and &quot;Virgen de los Caminos&quot; (1994).

== In popular culture ==
===Literature and film===

One notable reference in literature to the image and its alleged predecessor, the Aztec Earth goddess Tonantzin, is in Sandra Cisneros&#x27; short story &quot;Little Miracles, Kept Promises&quot;, from her collection &quot;Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories&quot; (1991). Cisneros&#x27; story is constructed out of brief notes that people give Our Lady of Guadalupe in thanks for favors received, which in Cisneros&#x27; hands becomes a portrait of an extended Chicano community living throughout Texas. &quot;Little Miracles&quot; ends with an extended narrative (pp. 124–129) of a feminist artist, Rosario &quot;Chayo&quot; de León, who at first did not allow images of La Virgen de Guadalupe in her home because she associated her with subservience and suffering, particularly by Mexican women. But when she learns that Guadalupe&#x27;s shrine is built on the same hill in Mexico City that had a shrine to Tonantzin, the Aztec Earth goddess and serpent destroyer, Chayo comes to understand that there&#x27;s a deep, syncretic connection between the Aztec goddess and the Mexican saint; together they inspire Chayo&#x27;s new artistic creativity, inner strength, and independence. In Chayo&#x27;s words, &quot;I finally understood who you are. No longer Mary the mild, but our mother Tonantzin. Your church at Tepeyac built on the site of her temple&quot; (128).
The image and its alleged apparition was investigated several times, including in the 2013 documentary &quot;The Blood &amp; The Rose&quot;, directed by Tim Watkins.

===Visual arts===
Drawing on the significance of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Chicano culture, many Chicano artists revere her image and visually reimagine the religious figure within a feminist and contemporary context. More than just a religious symbol, Chicano artists view Our Lady of Guadalupe as an empowering feminist icon and a proclamation of Indigenous pride. However, these re-envisioned artworks have not been without controversy, as many artists have faced intense backlash from Catholic groups who view these artworks as &quot;disrespectful and irreverent&quot;. One of the most famous controversies was sparked by Alma López&#x27;s &quot;Our Lady&quot; digital collage, which later led to a book titled &quot;Our Lady of Controversy: Alma López&#x27;s Irreverent Apparition&quot;. Despite this, Chicano artists such as Yolanda López, Alma López, Margarita &#x27;Mita&#x27; Cuaron, Ester Hernández, and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood, among others, have used Our Lady of Guadalupe&#x27;s portrait to explore themes of repression, feminine strength, and to uplift women.

<text>Kleptocracy (from Greek , &quot;thief&quot;, or , &quot;I steal&quot;, and from , &quot;power, rule&quot;), also referred to as thievocracy, is a government whose corrupt leaders (kleptocrats) use political power to expropriate the wealth of the people and land they govern, typically by embezzling or misappropriating government funds at the expense of the wider population. One feature of political-based socioeconomic thievery is that there is often no public announcement explaining or apologizing for misappropriations, nor any legal charges or punishment levied against the offenders.

Kleptocracy is different from plutocracy (rule by the richest) and oligarchy (rule by a small elite). In a kleptocracy, corrupt politicians enrich themselves secretly outside the rule of law, through kickbacks, bribes, and special favors from lobbyists and corporations, or they simply direct state funds to themselves and their associates. Also, kleptocrats often export much of their profits to foreign nations in anticipation of losing power.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the first use in English occurs in the publication &quot;Indicator&quot; of 1819: &quot;Titular ornaments, common to Spanish kleptocracy.&quot;

==Characteristics==

Kleptocratic rulers often treat their country&#x27;s treasury as a source of personal wealth, spending funds on luxury goods and extravagances as they see fit. Many kleptocratic rulers secretly transfer public funds into hidden personal accounts in foreign countries to provide for themselves if removed from power.

According to L.K. Samuels, one reason governmental bodies subscribe to theft-prone policies is to lay the groundwork for the socialization of labor and property, thus permitting kleptocrats to make a populace &quot;subservient to an institutionalized authority.&quot; Journalist Paul Greenberg, in writing in 1989 against the idea of the United States sending substantial foreign aid to Poland, argued that the country was emerging from &quot;40 years of a Communist thievocracy that has obliterated not only economic progress but also the idea of a modern economy.&quot;

== Financial system ==

Contemporary studies have identified 21st-century kleptocracy as a global financial system based on money laundering, which &quot;depends on the services of the world&#x27;s largest banks and expert financial professionals&quot;. The International Monetary Fund has suggested it could be a consensus of estimates, that money laundering made up 2–5 percent of the global economy in 1998. Kleptocrats engage in money laundering to obscure the corrupt origins of their wealth and safeguard it from domestic threats such as economic instability and predatory kleptocratic rivals. They are then able to secure this wealth in assets and investments within more stable jurisdictions, where it can then be stored for personal use, returned to the country of origin to support the kleptocrat&#x27;s domestic activities, or deployed elsewhere to protect and project the regime&#x27;s interests overseas.

Kleptocrats abuse the freedoms found in Western countries by transferring funds out of a kleptocracy and into Western jurisdictions for money laundering and asset security. Since 2011, more than $1 trillion has left developing countries annually in illicit financial outflows. A 2016 study found that $12 trillion had been siphoned out of the kleptocracies of Russia, China, and developing economies. Western professional services providers are taken advantage of by kleptocratic Russians and Chinese, exploiting legal and financial loopholes in the West to facilitate transnational money laundering. The kleptocratic financial system typically comprises four steps according to one opinion.

:First, kleptocrats or those operating on their behalf create anonymous shell companies to conceal the origins and ownership of the funds. Multiple interlocking networks of anonymous shell companies may be created and nominee directors appointed to further conceal the kleptocrat as the ultimate beneficial owner of the funds.

:Second, kleptocrats violate Western laws when they illegally transfer funds into the Western financial system.

:Third, financial transactions conducted by the kleptocrat in a Western country complete the integration of the funds. Once a kleptocrat has purchased an asset this can then be resold, providing a defensible albeit illegal origin of the funds. This is known as money laundering and is illegal throughout the Western world. Research has shown that the purchase of luxury real estate is a particularly favored method, especially by Chinese and Russian kleptocrats.

:Fourth, according to a British tabloid, kleptocrats may use their illegally laundered funds to engage in reputation laundering, hiring public relations firms to present a positive public image and lawyers to suppress journalistic scrutiny of their political connections and the origins of their wealth.

In a 2011 forensic study of grand corruption cases, the World Bank found the United States was the leading victim of illegal incorporation of entities involved in money laundering schemes. The Department of Treasury estimates that $300 billion is laundered annually in the United States in violation of US law.

This kleptocratic financial system flourishes in the United States by illegally abusing the United States&#x27; liberal economic structure for two reasons.

:First, the United States does not have a beneficial ownership registry, and kleptocrats take advantage of this privacy benefit.

:Second, kleptocrats take advantage of incorporation agents, lawyers, and realtors to unknowingly launder their money.

Currently, there are only around 1,200 money laundering convictions per year in the United States and money launderers face a less than five percent chance of conviction. Raymond Baker estimates that law enforcement fails in 99.9% of cases to detect money laundering by kleptocrats and other financial criminals.

Other Western jurisdictions favoured by kleptocrats include South Africa, the United Kingdom, and its dependencies, especially the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, and Jersey. Jurisdictions in the European Union that are particularly favoured by kleptocrats include Cyprus, the Netherlands, and its dependency on the Dutch Antilles.

==Political and corporate kleptomania==
Other forms of a thievery society that can induce a &quot;culture of systematic fraud&quot; have been described as &quot;political and corporate kleptomania.&quot; In this case, the plunder and looting enriches not only high government officials, but a narrow class of plutocrats, who usually represent wealthy individuals and families who have amassed great assets through the usage of political favoritism, special interest legislation, monopolies, special tax breaks, state intervention, subsidies or outright graft. This type of economic system of political spoils is sometimes referred to as crony capitalism.

==Effects==
The effects of a kleptocratic regime or government on a nation are typically adverse in regards to the welfare of the state&#x27;s economy, political affairs, and civil rights. Kleptocratic governance typically ruins prospects of foreign investment and drastically weakens the domestic market and cross-border trade. As kleptocracies often embezzle money from their citizens by misusing funds derived from tax payments, or engage heavily in money laundering schemes, they tend to heavily degrade the quality of life for citizens.

In addition, the money that kleptocrats steal is diverted from funds earmarked for public amenities such as the building of hospitals, schools, roads, parks – having further adverse effects on the quality of life of citizens. The informal oligarchy that results from a kleptocratic elite subverts democracy (or any other political format).

==Examples==
In early 2004, the German anti-corruption NGO Transparency International released a list of ten self-enriching leaders in the two decades previous to the report. Transparency International acknowledged that they were &quot;not necessarily the 10 most corrupt leaders&quot; and noted that &quot;very little is known about the amounts actually embezzled&quot;.

In descending order of amount allegedly stolen (converted to United States dollars), they were:
# Former Indonesian President Suharto ($15 billion to $35 billion)
# Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos ($5 billion to $10 billion)
# Former Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko ($5 billion)
# Former Nigerian Head of State Sani Abacha ($2 billion to $5 billion)
# Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević ($1 billion)
# Former Haitian President Jean-Claude Duvalier ($300 million to $800 million)
# Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori ($600 million)
# Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko ($114 million to $200 million)
# Former Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Alemán ($100 million)
# Former Philippine President Joseph Estrada ($78 million to $80 million)

The political system in Russia has been described as a Mafia state where president Vladimir Putin serves as the &quot;head of the clan&quot;. 

Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak had $731 million in his personal bank accounts when his ruling party alliance Barisan Nasional lost the 14th election to opposition party Pakatan Harapan led by former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, in part because of allegations of participating in the 1MDB scandal.

Azerbaijan has been described as a kleptocracy for its use of oil revenue to enrich an oligarch class, including that of the ruling Aliyev dynasty.

In 2010, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; estimated that HDZ elites in Croatia led by former prime minister Ivo Sanader had &quot;stolen or siphoned off&quot; about 1 billion USD.

==Narcokleptocracy==
A narcokleptocracy is a society in which criminals involved in the trade of narcotics have undue influence on the governance of a state. For instance, the term was used to describe the regime of Manuel Noriega in Panama in a report prepared by a subcommittee of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations chaired by Massachusetts Senator John Kerry.

In 2020, the United States charged the president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro with drug trafficking, as well as many officials and head figures of his administration.

<text>The Italian Riviera or Ligurian Riviera ( ; ) is the narrow coastal strip in Italy which lies between the Ligurian Sea and the mountain chain formed by the Maritime Alps and the Apennines. Longitudinally it extends from the border with France and the French Riviera (or ) near Ventimiglia (a former customs post) eastwards to Capo Corvo (also known as Punta Bianca) which marks the eastern end of the Gulf of La Spezia and is close to the regional border between Liguria and Tuscany. The Italian Riviera thus includes nearly all of the coastline of Liguria. Historically the &quot;Riviera&quot; extended further to the west, through what is now French territory as far as Marseille.

The Italian Riviera crosses all four Ligurian provinces and their capitals Genoa, Savona, Imperia and La Spezia, with a total length of about 350 km (218 miles). It is customarily divided into a western section, the Ponente Riviera, and an eastern section, the Levante Riviera, the point of division being the apex of the Ligurian arc at Voltri. It has about 1.6 million inhabitants, and most of the population is concentrated within the coastal area. Its mild climate draws an active tourist trade in the numerous coastal resorts, which include Alassio, Bonassola, Bordighera, Camogli, Cinque Terre, Lerici, Levanto, Noli, Portofino, Porto Venere, Santa Margherita Ligure, Sanremo, San Fruttuoso, and Sestri Levante. It is also known for its historical association with international celebrity and artistic visitors; writers and poets like Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, Ezra Pound, and Ernest Hemingway were inspired by the beauty and spirit of Liguria.

As a tourist centre, the Italian Riviera benefits from over 300 days of sunshine per year, and is known for its beaches, colourfully painted towns, natural environment, food, and luxury villas and hotels, as well as for its popular resort facilities, major yachting and cruising areas with several marinas, festivals, golf courses, sailing, rock climbing and scenic views of centuries old farmhouses and cottages.

Industries are concentrated in and around Genoa, Savona, and along the shores of the Gulf of La Spezia. Genoa and La Spezia are Italy&#x27;s leading shipyards; La Spezia is Italy&#x27;s major naval base, and Savona is a major centre of the Italian iron industry. Chemical, textile, and food industries are also important.

 in the center of Genoa and the Cinque Terre National Park (which includes &quot;Cinque Terre&quot;, Portovenere, and the islands Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto) are two of Italy&#x27;s 58 World Heritage Sites.

==Overview==
The Riviera&#x27;s centre is Genoa, which divides it into two main sections: the Riviera di Ponente (&quot;the coast of the setting sun&quot;), extending westwards from Genoa to the French border; and the Riviera di Levante (&quot;the coast of the rising sun&quot;) between Genoa and Capo Corvo.

It is known for its mild climate and its reputation for a relaxed way of life, old fishing ports, and landscapes. It has been a popular destination for travellers and tourists since the time of Byron and Percy Shelley.

Many villages and towns in the area are internationally known, such as Portofino, Bordighera, Lerici and the Cinque Terre. Many villages of Italian Riviera are counted among I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

The part of the Riviera di Ponente centred on Savona, is called the Riviera delle Palme (the Riviera of palms); the part centred on Sanremo, is the Riviera dei Fiori, after the long-established flower growing industry.

<text>The government of Afghanistan is currently disputed following the effective collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan during the fall of Kabul to Taliban forces on 15 August 2021 and the subsequent re-establishment of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which now exercises &quot;de facto&quot; control over most of the country. On 7 September 2021 the Taliban officials in de facto control of most of Afghanistan announced a new interim government headed by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund as Prime Minister. The government is subject to the oversight of the Taliban&#x27;s Supreme Leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada. As of 8 September 2021, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has not yet been formally recognized as the de jure government of Afghanistan by any other country. The representatives appointed by the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan continue to represent the country at the United Nations. These representatives have refused to recognize the Taliban appointed government and have urged other countries to not recognize this government either.

Between 2002 and 2021, the government of Afghanistan consisted of the cabinet of ministers, provincial governors and the national assembly, with a president serving as the head of state, head of government and commander-in-chief of the Afghan Armed Forces. The nation was formerly led by President Ashraf Ghani who was backed by two vice presidents, Amrullah Saleh and Sarwar Danish until Ghani fled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in August 2021 due to Taliban fighters reaching the capital Kabul, which established a &quot;de facto&quot; government. In the last decade the politics of Afghanistan have been influenced by NATO countries, particularly the United States, in an effort to stabilise and democratise the country. In 2004, the nation&#x27;s new constitution was adopted and an executive president was elected. The following year a general election to choose parliamentarians took place.

Hamid Karzai was declared the first-ever democratically elected head of state in Afghanistan in 2004, winning a second five-year term in 2009. The National Assembly was Afghanistan&#x27;s national legislature. It was a bicameral body, composed of the House of the People and the House of Elders. The first legislature was elected in 2005 and the most recent one in 2018. Members of the Supreme Court were appointed by the president to form the judiciary. Together, this system served to provide a set of checks and balances.

==History==
===Background===

Afghanistan was an Islamic republic consisting of three branches of power (executive, legislative, and judiciary) overseen by checks and balances. The country was led by President Ashraf Ghani, who replaced Hamid Karzai in 2014. Before the election of 2004, Karzai led the country after being appointed as President of the Afghan Transitional Administration. While supporters have praised Karzai&#x27;s efforts to promote national reconciliation and a growing economy, critics charge him with failing to stem corruption and the illegal drug production. 

The National Assembly was elected in 2005 and then in 2010. Among the elected officials were former mujahideen, Islamic fundamentalists, reformists, communists, and several Taliban associates. About 28% of the delegates elected were women, 3% more than the 25% minimum guaranteed under the constitution. This made Afghanistan one of the leading countries in terms of female representation in the legislature. 

The Supreme Court of Afghanistan was led by Chief Justice Sayed Yusuf Halem, replacing Abdul Salam Azimi in 2014. The Deputy Chief Justice was Bahauddin Baha.

===Northern Alliance and Taliban government===

In September 1996, officials of the Islamic State of Afghanistan under Burhanuddin Rabbani were displaced by forces of the Taliban. The United Nations refused to recognize the Taliban government, instead it recognized the Islamic State as the official government in exile. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference left the Afghan seat vacant until the question of legitimacy could be resolved through negotiations among the warring factions. The Taliban controlled 95% of the territory by 2001 and only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognized them as the government of Afghanistan. The remaining 5% belonged to rebel forces that became known as the Northern Alliance.

===Military action by the United States and allies===

After the Taliban&#x27;s refusal to hand over Osama bin Laden to U.S. authorities for his involvement in the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., a US-led international coalition was formed; after several weeks of aerial bombardment by coalition forces and military action on the ground, including operations with the Northern Alliance, the Taliban was officially ousted from power on November 17, 2001.

===Bonn Agreement===

In December 2001, a number of prominent Afghans met under the United Nations auspices in Germany to decide on a plan for governing the country. As a result, the Afghan Interim Administration (AIA) – made up of 30 members, headed by a chairman – was inaugurated on December 22, 2001, with a six-month mandate to be followed by a two-year Afghan Transitional Administration (ATA), after which elections are to be held. Some provisions in the agreement have expired, due to the creation of the constitution. Still, the agreement paved the way for the creation of a democratic Afghanistan.

===ISAF and Afghan security forces===

The United Nations Security Council authorized the creation of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to help provide basic security for the population of Afghanistan. Members of the United States Armed Forces and other NATO countries began sending large number of troops to Afghanistan. They began to train the Afghan Armed Forces and Afghan National Police as well as fight insurgents and take part in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.

===New constitution and national elections===

The structure of the Transitional Authority was announced on June 10, 2002, when an emergency loya jirga (grand assembly) convened establishing the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan (TISA), which had 18 months to hold a constitutional loya jirga to adopt a constitution and 24 months to hold nationwide elections. The loya jirga was replaced by the National Assembly.

Under the Bonn Agreement the Afghan Constitution Commission was established to consult with the public and formulate a draft constitution. The meeting of a constitutional &quot;loya jirga&quot; was held in December 2003, when a new constitution was adopted creating a presidential form of government with a bicameral legislature: the House of Elders (Meshrano Jirga) and the House of the People (Wolesi Jirga).

The 2004 presidential election was held on October 9, with over 10 million Afghans being registered to vote. Many of the candidates running against Hamid Karzai tried to boycott the election because they feared irregularities. However, Karzai made this statement to the media: An independent commission found evidence of fraud, but ruled that it did not affect the outcome of the poll and Karzai won with 55.4% of the vote. He was inaugurated as President on December 7 of that year. It was the country&#x27;s first national election since 1969, when parliamentary elections were last held.

In September 2005, the parliamentary election was held; the National Assembly opened after the results were announced. In December 2005, Sibghatullah Mojadeddi was picked to head the 102-seat upper house and Yunus Qanuni was chosen to lead the 249-seat lower house of parliament.

==Executive branch==
The Constitution of Afghanistan creates a strong presidency, serving as the head of state and Commander-in-Chief of the Afghan Armed Forces. A president is elected with two vice-presidents. The president appoints cabinet ministers and provincial governors, which are to be approved by the National Assembly.

===Presidency of Hamid Karzai===
Hamid Karzai served as the Chairman of the Interim Administration from December 2001 to June 2002. He then served as the Interim President between June 2002 to October 2004. He officially became the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan after winning the 2004 presidential election.

====First term====
The United States is the leading nation in the rebuilding and democratization of Afghanistan. United States-Afghanistan relations have improved since late 2001, especially after the Karzai administration was formed. Foreign relations of Afghanistan with other NATO members and regional countries have also improved under the Karzai administration.

After winning the 2004 election and removing many of the former Northern Alliance warlords from his cabinet, it was thought that Karzai would pursue a more aggressively reformist path in 2005 but he proved to be more cautious. Ever since Karzai&#x27;s new administration took over in 2004, the economy of Afghanistan has been growing rapidly for the first time in many years. Government revenue is increasing every year, although it is still heavily dependent on foreign aid. During the Karzai administration, public discontent grew about corruption and the civilian casualties in the fight against the Taliban insurgency.

====Second term====
Three months after the 2009 election, President Karzai was officially declared the winner. The Obama administration urged Karzai to exclude ineffective or corrupt officials from the new government, while powerful Afghans who helped deliver his re-election were demanding positions. According to political analysts, the list of ministers Karzai presented to the Parliament was &quot;not encouraging&quot;, but it reflected realpolitik. Slightly more than half were ministers who would stay in their current positions or who had served previously in Karzai&#x27;s government. In January 2009, the Afghan Parliament rejected 17 of Karzai&#x27;s 24 cabinet nominees, approving only seven. Relations between US President Barack Obama and Karzai were not so great in the beginning but by 2012 they slightly improved, especially after the death of Osama bin Laden and the assassination of Karzai&#x27;s brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai. President Obama made two official visits to Afghanistan between 2010 and 2012. The relations again began to decline in late 2013 after Karzai decided not to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) with the United States.

===Presidency of Ashraf Ghani===
After a disputed election, Ashraf Ghani became President of Afghanistan and Abdullah Abdullah became Chief Executive Officer of Afghanistan in September 2014. One day later, the new Afghan government signed the Bilateral Security Agreement.

On August 15, 2021, during the 2021 Taliban offensive, as the Fall of Kabul was occurring, Ashraf Ghani left Afghanistan with his wife to Abu Dhabi in the UAE. Some unconfirmed reports suggest that Ghani may return to Kabul in the future.

==Legislative branch==
The 2005 parliamentary election for the Wolesi Jirga (House of the People) were conducted on September 18, 2005. This was the first parliamentary election in Afghanistan since 1969. Approximately 2,707 candidates, including 328 women, competed for 249 seats. The election was conducted with multiple seat electoral constituencies. Each province is a constituency and has a varying number of seats, depending on population. Voters have a single non-transferable vote.

The Meshrano Jirga (House of Elders) consists of 102 members. One-third of the members were appointed by the president, while another third was elected by the provincial councils. Elections for the provincial councils were held simultaneously with those for the Wolesi Jirga. The remaining third are to be elected by district councils.

==Elections==
===2004 presidential===
The first presidential election under the new constitution was held on October 9, 2004. Interim-president Karzai had enough votes to avoid a run-off.

===2005 parliamentary===

Afghanistan held parliamentary elections on 18 September 2005. First results were announced on 9 October and final results on 12 November 2005. Since all candidates were not listed by party and elected as non-partisans, a breakdown by party was not possible. Turnout was estimated at 50 percent.

===2009 presidential===

The 2009 presidential election was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout and widespread ballot stuffing, intimidation, and other electoral fraud.

The vote, along with elections for 420 provincial council seats, took place on August 20, 2009, but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation.

Two months later, under heavy U.S. and ally pressure, a second round run-off vote between incumbent President Hamid Karzai and his main rival Abdullah Abdullah was announced for November 7, 2009. On November 1, however, Abdullah announced that he would no longer be participating in the run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met, and a &quot;transparent election is not possible.&quot; A day later, on November 2, 2009, officials of the election commission canceled the run-off and declared Hamid Karzai as President of Afghanistan for another 5-year term.

===2014 presidential===
The 2014 presidential election was held in April 2014, followed by a run-off in June 2014. The results of both ballots were challenged by the losing candidate Abdullah Abdullah, who claimed the results were manipulated to ensure his opponent Ashraf Ghani was declared the winner. The results of the election remained in dispute until September 2014, despite a proposal by the United States that the candidates agree to a power-sharing deal, which was initially agreed to. A UN-led audit failed to sway Abdullah as he insisted the audit team could not explain a million extra votes counted in the run-off. Ghani supporters insisted they wanted to do a deal and were leaving the door open to negotiations.

=== 2019 presidential ===

The 2019 presidential election was held on September 2, 2019, with Ashraf Ghani narrowly reelected over Abdullah Abdullah who contested the preliminary results. When the final results were released in February 2020, Abdullah rejected them, forming a parallel government and organising a separate inauguration. Nonetheless, Ghani was officially sworn in on March 9, 2020. The dispute was resolved on May 16, 2020, when the two signed a power-sharing deal whereby Ghani remained president, however both would choose an equal number of ministers and Abdullah would lead peace talks with the Taliban.

==Judicial branch==

The constitution of Afghanistan mandates a Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the highest judicial authority in Afghanistan and is the court of last resort. Judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the National Assembly. Lower courts included magistrate courts, Courts of First Instance, and the Intermediate Court of Appeals. Intermediate Court of Appeals review decisions of lower courts, before appeals are sent to the Supreme Court. If an appeal loses, they can be sent to the Supreme Court. Courts of First Instance exist in every city. They have several branches that try all major cases. The branches include Criminal, Civil, Religious, Administrative, Labor, and Family divisions. Also in the first instance include military courts, which try military personnel. Magistrate Courts are at the lowest level, which tries minor civil and criminal cases.

<text>The Kooikerhondje is a small spaniel-type dog breed of Dutch ancestry that was originally used as a working dog, particularly in a decoy to lure ducks. The breed dates back to the 16th century and makes frequent appearances in paintings from the Dutch Golden Age.

==Description==

===Appearance===
The Kooikerhondje is a small, spaniel-like sporting dog. Originally bred in the Netherlands as a duck hunting dog, it has a white plumed tail for the purpose of attracting ducks.

The preferred height at the withers is for males and for females. The FCI standard allows a range of for males, and for females. The breed has a wavy, medium-length double coat, and its coloration is white and orange-red. Some Kooikerhondjes have black ear tips, which are referred to as &quot;earrings&quot;.

===Health===
A number of heritable diseases have been identified in the Kooikerhondje, including inflammatory myopathy, Type III von Willebrand&#x27;s disease, necrotising myelopathy, renal dysplasia, patellar luxation, and ataxia. A Dutch study of 842 Kooikerhondjes found that patellar luxation was prevalent in 24% of dogs scanned. During the time period of the study — which started in 1994 and ended in 2011 — the prevalence of the condition fell from 28% to 19%, although the prevalence is still higher than for other spaniel dogs.

==History==
The Kooikerhondje was developed in the Netherlands sometime around the 16th century in order to lure ducks into duck decoys where hunters could easily catch the fowl. The hunting style of the Kooikerhondje was inspired by foxes, as Dutch hunters realized that ducks were enticed by foxes playing near water, as long as they didn&#x27;t make eye contact.

The Kooikerhondje frequently appears in paintings by Dutch masters such as Jan Steen, Rembrandt, and Johannes Vermeer. The breed is believed to be an ancestor of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever.

The breed almost became extinct during World War II until Baroness van Hardenbroek van Ammerstol rescued it. The breed was not officially recognized by the Dutch Kennel Club until 1971 and has since been imported into other countries and recognized officially. In January 2013, the Kennel Club announced it was reclassifying the Kooikerhondje from the gun dog group to the utility group effective from January 2014. The decision was reached after discussions with the U.K. breed clubs and unanimous agreement was achieved.

The Kooikerhondje was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2018. The breed gained fame in the United States in the 2020s, in part due to Decoy Ohtani, a Kooikerhondje owned by baseball player Shohei Ohtani.

<text>Ignacio de Loyola () is a 2016 Philippine historical biographical religious drama film directed by Paolo Dy in his directorial debut. It is based on the memoirs of Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order who was canonized as a saint in the Catholic Church. The film stars Andreas Muñoz, a Spanish actor who portrays the titular character in the film.

==Cast==
==Production==

The English-language film was helmed by Filipino director Paolo Dy and was produced by the media arm of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines, Jesuit Communications. The musical score was written by Filipino composer Ryan Cayabyab.

The film was shot primarily in Spain, particularly in Navarra and the Basque Country, over twenty days, with a ten-hour cap per day. The film budget was pegged at , with The One Meralco Foundation being among the sponsors of the film. Post-production, including the film&#x27;s special effects, was done in the Philippines. Dy said that the most challenging part in shooting the film was the battle scene, for which the production team had to bring in stuntmen from the Canary Islands.

It was around 2012 that the Jesuit Communications Foundation contacted director Paolo Dy about making the film. Before shooting, the director&#x27;s wife Cathy Azanza-Dy sought the aid of her friends from the Philippine theater industry in developing the script. Luna Inocian read the script and provided comments, while others including Jenny Jamora, Topper Fabregas, and Steve Cadd did a table reading in Manila. They reviewed each scene&#x27;s good points and identified those elements that could be scrapped. They also improved each character&#x27;s arc. Dy and his wife honed each character&#x27;s motivation and relationships, and brought the film&#x27;s focus upon the humanity of Ignatius of Loyola, creating a protagonist with whom the audience could identify. The film adopts elements from traditional theater. The film&#x27;s costumes were conceived to materially represent each of the character&#x27;s personalities and are not necessarily historically accurate. Costume designer Juvan Bermil designed the approximately four hundred period costumes. The Spanish cast comprises actors and actresses also with a background in theater.

==Release==
The film was screened at the Vatican Film Library in the Vatican City on June 14, 2016, becoming the first Philippine film to be screened in the city-state. The Philippine premiere was held at The Theater at Solaire Resort and Casino, Paranaque City on July 23, 2016. The premiere was accompanied by a live orchestra conducted by Gerard Salonga. The film then began its commercial run in Philippine cinemas on July 27, 2016.

&quot;Ignacio de Loyola&quot; is also planned to be screened in Jesuit communities and universities across the world.

The film was screened in the United States in select cinemas on August 26, 2016.

==Possible sequel==
If reception to the film is satisfactory, a sequel to the film will be produced, this time on Francis Xavier, a friend of Ignatius of Loyola and co-founder of the Society of Jesus.

<text>The government of Italy is that of a democratic republic, established by the Italian constitution in 1948. It consists of legislative, executive, and judicial subdivisions, as well as of a head of state, known as the president.

The Constitution of the Italian Republic is the result of the work of the Constituent Assembly, which was formed by the representatives of all the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of nazis and the fascist forces during the Italian Civil War. Article 1 of the Italian constitution states: 

By stating that Italy is a democratic republic, the article solemnly declares the results of the institutional referendum which took place on 2 June 1946 valid. The state is not the hereditary property of the ruling monarch, but instead a &quot;res publica&quot;, belonging to everyone.

The people who are called to temporarily administer the republic are not owners, but servants; and the governed are not subjects, but citizens. And the sovereignty, that is the power to make choices that involve the entire community, belongs to the people, in accordance with the concept of a democracy, from the Greek &quot;demos&quot; (people) and &quot;kratìa&quot; (power). However, this power is not to be exercised arbitrarily by mob rule, but in the forms and within the limits established by the rule of law.

== Head of State ==
The President of the Republic of Italy is the head of state and represents the unity of the nation (art. 87 of the Constitution). The President serves as a point of connection between the three branches as he is elected by the lawmakers, appoints the executive and is the president of the judiciary. The president is also commander-in-chief in time of war.

The President of the Republic of Italy is elected for seven years by Parliament in joint session, together with three representatives of each region, except for the Aosta Valley, which gets only one representative. These delegates are elected by their respective regional councils so as to guarantee representation to minorities. The election needs a wide majority that is progressively reduced from two-thirds to one-half plus one of the votes after the third ballot. The only presidents ever to be elected on the first ballot are Francesco Cossiga and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Ciampi was replaced by Giorgio Napolitano, who was elected on 10 May 2006. While not forbidden by the law, no president had ever served two terms until 20 April 2013, when President Giorgio Napolitano was re-elected.

According to the constitution, any citizen who is 50 years old on the day of the election, and enjoys civil and political rights, can be elected president. The president cannot hold office in any other branch of power and the office&#x27;s salary and privileges are established by law.

Among the powers of the president, they have the capacity to:
* Send messages to the parliament, authorise the introduction of bills by the government, and promulgate laws, decrees and regulations.
* Dissolve one or both houses of parliament, in consultation with their presidents, except during the last six months of his term, unless that period coincides at least in part with the final six months of the parliament.
* Call a general referendum under certain circumstances established by the constitution.
* Appoint state officials in the cases established by the law.
* Accredit and receive diplomats, and ratify international treaties, after the parliament&#x27;s authorisation when required.
* Make declarations of war agreed upon by the parliament, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
* Grant pardons, commute sentences, and confer the orders, decorations, and medals of Italy.

The president also presides over the High Council of the Judiciary and the Supreme Council of Defence. Usually, the president tries to stay out of the day-to-day politics, and tries to be an institutional guarantee for all those involved in the political process. The president is not responsible for the actions performed in the exercise of his duties, except for high treason and violation of the Italian constitution, for which the president can be impeached by the parliament in joint session, with an absolute majority of its members.

== Legislative branch ==

With article 48 of the constitution, which guarantees the right to vote, the people exercise their power through their elected representatives in the parliament. The Italian Parliament has a bicameral system, and consists of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic, elected every five years.

The Chamber of Deputies is elected by direct and universal suffrage by voters who are eighteen or older. There are 400 deputies, eight of which are elected in the overseas constituencies. All voters who are twenty-five or older on election day are eligible to be deputies.

The senate is elected by direct and universal suffrage by voters who are eighteen or older. There are 200 senators, four of whom are elected in the overseas constituencies. There are also a small number of senators for life, such as former presidents and up to five citizens appointed by the president for having brought honor to the nation with their achievements. All voters who are forty or older on election day are eligible to be senators. Elections of senators for each region being based on a modified proportional representation system.

== Executive branch ==

The constitution establishes the Government of Italy as composed of the President of the Council of Ministers (prime minister) and the cabinet&#x27;s ministers. The President of Italy appoints the prime minister and, on the prime minister&#x27;s proposal, the subsequent ministers that form their cabinet. The appointee is usually the leader of the majority coalition that won the election (e.g. Berlusconi IV Cabinet), but they can also be a new leader emerging from a post-election leadership challenge within the majority coalition (e.g. Renzi Cabinet), or a person instructed by the President to form a national unity government in times of political crisis, such as in a coalition shift (e.g. Conte II Cabinet), or if enough politicians from the majority coalition switch parties (e.g. Monti Cabinet). In any scenario, the government must receive the confidence of both houses, so the executive branch derives its legitimacy from the Italian Parliament and the great number of political parties forces the prime minister to bend to their will.

If the majority coalition no longer supports the government, the Prime Minister can be ousted with a vote of no confidence, at which point the President can either appoint a new Prime Minister capable of forming a government with the support of Parliament, or dissolve parliament and call for new elections. Cabinet reshuffles are also possible in case specific ministers lack the support of the parliament, while the prime minister remains in charge. In the history of the Italian Republic, there have been twenty legislatures (including the Constituent Assembly), forty-five consecutive premierships, and sixty-eight different cabinets.

== Judicial branch ==
The law of Italy has a plurality of sources of production. These are arranged in a hierarchical scale, under which the rule of a lower source cannot conflict with the rule of an upper source (hierarchy of sources). The constitution of 1948 is the main source.

The constitution states that justice is administered in the name of the people and that judges are subject only to the law. So the judiciary is a branch that is completely autonomous and independent of all other branches of power, even though the minister of justice is responsible for the organization and functioning of those services involved with justice and has the power to originate disciplinary actions against judges, which are then administered by the High Council of the Judiciary, presided over by the president.

The judiciary of Italy is based on Roman law, the Napoleonic Code and later statutes. It is based on a mix of the adversarial and inquisitorial civil law systems, although the adversarial system was adopted in the appeal courts in 1988. Appeals are treated almost as new trials, and three degrees of trial are present. The third is a legitimating trial.

There is only partial judicial review of legislation in the North-American sense. Judicial review can be enacted only under certain conditions, either it already being established by constitutional law, or in the Constitutional Court, which can reject violating laws after judicial scrutiny. According to Article 134 of the constitution, the Constitutional Court shall pass judgement on:
* Controversies on the constitutionality of laws issued by the state and regions.
* Conflicts arising from the allocation of powers of the state and those powers’ allocation between regions.
* Charges brought against the president and until 1989 the ministers.

The Constitutional Court is composed of 15 judges, one of which is the President of the Italian Constitutional Court elected from the court itself. One third of the judges are appointed by the President of the Italian Republic, one-third are elected by Parliament and one-third are elected by the ordinary and administrative supreme courts. The Constitutional Court passes on the constitutionality of laws, and is a post-World War II innovation.

The Constitutional Court was primarily established &quot;for the protection of the legal order and only indirectly as an institution for the vindication of fundamental rights&quot; of individuals. The court generally only has the power of judicial review over &quot;laws and enactments having force of law issued by the State and Regions&quot; (what is called primary legislation in civil-law systems) and does not have the power to review administration acts and regulations, or parliamentary rules.

In November 2014, Italy accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.

<text>The population of Afghanistan is around 49.5 million as of 2025. The nation is composed of a multi-ethnic and multilingual society, reflecting its location astride historic trade and invasion routes between Central Asia, South Asia, and Western Asia. Ethnic groups in the country include Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek, as well as smaller groups such as Baloch, Nuristani, Turkmen, Aimaq, Mongol and some others which are less known. Together they make up the contemporary Afghan people.

Approximately 43% of the population is under 15 years of age, and 74% of all Afghans live in rural areas. The average woman gives birth to five children during her entire life, the highest fertility rate outside of Africa. About 6.8% of all babies die in child-birth or infancy. The average life expectancy of the nation was reported in 2019 at around 63 years, and only 0.04% of the population has HIV.

Pashto (پښتو) and Dari are the official languages of the country. Dari functions as the inter-ethnic lingua franca for the vast majority. Pashto is widely used in the regions south of the Hindu Kush mountains and as far as the Indus River in neighbouring Pakistan. Uzbek and Turkmen are smaller languages spoken in parts of the north. Multilingualism is common throughout the country, especially in the major cities.

Up to 69.7% of the population practices Sunni Islam and belongs to the Hanafi Islamic law school, while 30–35% are followers of Shia Islam; the majority of whom belong to the Twelver branch, with smaller numbers of Ismailis. The remaining 0.3% practice other religions such as Sikhism and Hinduism. Excluding urban populations in the principal cities, most people are organised into tribal and other kinship-based groups, who follow their own traditional customs.

== Population size and structure ==

Anatol Lieven of Georgetown University in Qatar wrote in 2021 that &quot;it may be noted that in the whole of modern Afghan history there has never been a census that could be regarded as remotely reliable.&quot;

=== Historical ===

The first and only nationwide census of Afghanistan was carried out in 1979. It revealed a population of 13,051,358 (rural 11,037,231, urban 2,014,127). Previously there had been scattered attempts to conduct censuses in individual cities. According to the 1876 census, Kabul had a population of 140,700 people. In Kandahar in 1891 a population census was carried out, according to which 31,514 people lived in the city, of which 16,064 were men and 15,450 were women.

From 1979 until the end of 1983, some 5 million people left the country to take shelter in neighbouring northwestern Pakistan and eastern Iran. This exodus was largely unchecked by any government. The Afghan government in 1983 reported a population of 15.96 million, which presumably included the exodus.

It is assumed that roughly 600,000 to as high as 2 million Afghans may have been killed during the various 1979–2001 wars. These figures are questionable and no attempt has ever been made to verify if they were actually killed or had moved to neighbouring countries as refugees.

As no census has been performed after 1979 and millions of people may have left the country, the current population of Afghanistan can only be guessed.

=== Current and latest ===
As of 2021, the total population of Afghanistan is around 37.5 million, which includes the 3 million Afghan nationals living in both Pakistan and Iran. About 26% of the population is urbanite and the remaining 74% lives in rural areas.

Afghanistan&#x27;s Central Statistics Organization (CSO) stated in 2011 that the total number of Afghans living inside Afghanistan was about 26 million and by 2017 it reached 29.2 million. Of this, 15 million are males and 14.2 million are females. The country&#x27;s population is expected to reach 82 million by 2050.

Urban areas have experienced rapid population growth in the last decade, which is due to the return of over 5 million expats. The only city in Afghanistan with over a million residents is its capital, Kabul.

=== Structure of the population ===

=== Demographic and Health Surveys ===
Afghanistan 2024 total fertility rate has been estimated at 4.4.
 In 2022 it was 4.5, about twice the world average rate. The rate has fallen since the early 1980s.

== Ethnic groups ==

An approximate distribution of the ethnolinguistic groups are listed in the chart below:


The recent estimate in the above chart is somewhat supported by the below national opinion polls, which were aimed at knowing how a group of about 804 to 8,706 local residents in Afghanistan felt about the current war, political situation, as well as the economic and social issues affecting their daily lives. Ten surveys were conducted between 2004 and 2015 by the Asia Foundation (a sample is shown in the table below; the survey in 2015 did not contain information on the ethnicity of the participants) and one between 2004 and 2009 by a combined effort of the broadcasting companies NBC News, BBC, and ARD.


== Languages ==
Dari and Pashto are both official languages of Afghanistan.

Uzbek and Turkmen are spoken as native languages in northern provinces, mainly among the Uzbeks and Turkmens. Smaller number of Afghans are also fluent in English, Urdu, Balochi, Arabic and other languages. An approximate distribution of languages spoken in the country is shown in the chart below:


Based on information from the latest national opinion polls, up to 51% stated that they can speak or understand Pashto and up to 79% stated that they can speak or understand Dari. Uzbek was spoken or understood by up to 11% and Turkmen by up to 7%. Other languages that can be spoken are Arabic (4%) and Balochi (2%).

== Religion ==

Almost the entire Afghan population is Muslim, with less than 1% being non-Muslim. Despite attempts to secularise Afghan society, Islamic practices pervade all aspects of life. Likewise, Islamic religious tradition and codes, together with traditional practices, provide the principal means of controlling personal conduct and settling legal disputes. Islam was used as the main basis for expressing opposition to the progressive reforms of Afghanistan by King Amanullah in the 1920s.

The members of Sikh and Hindu communities are mostly concentrated in urban areas. They numbered hundreds of thousands in the 1970s but over 90% have since fled due to the Afghan wars and persecution.
* Islam: 99.7% of the total population
** Sunni Muslim: 84.7–89.7%
** Shia Muslim: 7-15%
* others: 0.3%
** Baha&#x27;is In the hundreds
** Sikhism: In the hundreds
** Hinduism: In the hundreds
** Zoroastrianism: Unknown/unreported
** Christianity: Unknown

<doc id="66480" wikidata="Q4593385" url="?curid=66480" title="AstroTurf">
<text>AstroTurf is an American subsidiary of SportGroup that produces artificial turf for playing surfaces in sports. The original AstroTurf product was a short-pile synthetic turf invented in 1965 by Monsanto. Since the early 2000s, AstroTurf has marketed taller pile systems that use materials to better replicate natural turf. In 2016, AstroTurf became a subsidiary of German-based SportGroup, a family of sports surfacing companies, which itself is owned by the investment firm Equistone Partners Europe.

==History==

The original AstroTurf brand product was invented by James M. Faria and Robert T. Wright at Monsanto. The original, experimental installation was inside the Waughhtel-Howe Field House at the Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1964. It was patented in 1965 and originally sold under the name &quot;ChemGrass.&quot; It was rebranded as AstroTurf by company employee John A. Wortmann after its first well-publicized use at the Houston Astrodome stadium in 1966. Donald L. Elbert patented two methods to improve the product in 1971.

Early iterations of the short-pile turf swept many major stadiums, but the product did need improvement. Concerns over directionality and traction led Monsanto&#x27;s R&amp;D department to implement a texturized nylon system. By imparting a crimped texture to the nylon after it was extruded, the product became highly uniform.

In 1987, Monsanto consolidated its AstroTurf management, marketing, and technical activities in Dalton, Georgia, as AstroTurf Industries, Inc. In 1988, Balsam AG purchased all the capital stock of AstroTurf Industries, Inc. In 1994, Southwest Recreational Industries, Inc. (SRI) acquired the AstroTurf brand. In 1996, SRI was acquired by American Sports Products Group Inc.

While AstroTurf was the industry leader throughout the late 20th century, other companies emerged in the early 2000s. FieldTurf, AstroTurf&#x27;s chief competitor since the early 2000s, marketed a product of tall-pile polyethylene turf with infill, meant to mimic natural grass more than the older products. This third-generation turf, as it became known, changed the landscape of the marketplace. Although SRI successfully marketed AstroPlay, a third-generation turf product, increased competition gave way to lawsuits. In 2000, SRI was awarded $1.5 million in a lawsuit after FieldTurf was deemed to have lied to the public by making false statements regarding its own product and making false claims about AstroTurf and AstroPlay products.
Despite their legal victory, increased competition took its toll. In 2004, SRI declared bankruptcy. Out of the bankruptcy proceedings, Textile Management Associates, Inc. (TMA) of Dalton, Georgia, acquired the AstroTurf brand and other assets. TMA began marketing the AstroTurf brand under the company AstroTurf, LLC. In 2006, General Sports Venue (GSV) became TMA&#x27;s marketing partner for the AstroTurf brand for the American market. AstroTurf, LLC handled the marketing of AstroTurf in the rest of the world.

In 2009, TMA acquired GSV to enter the marketplace as a direct seller. AstroTurf, LLC focused its efforts on research and development, which has promoted rapid growth. AstroTurf introduced new product features and installation methods, including AstroFlect (a heat-reduction technology) and field prefabrication (indoor, climate-controlled inlaying). AstroTurf also introduced a product called &quot;RootZone&quot; consisting of crimped fibers designed to encapsulate infill.

In 2016, SportGroup Holding announced that it would purchase AstroTurf, along with its associated manufacturing facilities. The AstroTurf brand has operated since then in North America as AstroTurf Corporation.

In August 2021, AstroTurf became the official supplier of artificial turf to the United Soccer League, who run soccer leagues at the second, third, and fourth tiers of the U.S. men&#x27;s soccer pyramid and the second tier of the U.S. women&#x27;s soccer pyramid.

* The backyard of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; house between the service porch and garage and under Tiger&#x27;s kennel is covered with AstroTurf. According to script development notes, the installation firm hired by Mike Brady to lay the turf was owned by his college roommate, who had just started a landscaping business after returning from a combat tour in the Vietnam War with the 18th Engineer Brigade. In keeping with studio instructions, no direct mention of the war in Vietnam appeared in the script. The scene in which the installation takes place was ultimately cut, so never appeared in the series.

<text>Ramsey Campbell (born 4 January 1946) is an English horror fiction writer, editor and critic who has been writing for well over fifty years. He is the author of over 30 novels and hundreds of short stories, many of them winners of literary awards. Three of his novels have been adapted into films.

Since he first came to prominence in the mid-1960s, critics have cited Campbell as one of the leading writers in his field: T.E.D. Klein has written that &quot;Campbell reigns supreme in the field today&quot;, and Robert Hadji has described him as &quot;perhaps the finest living exponent of the British weird fiction tradition&quot;, while S. T. Joshi stated, &quot;future generations will regard him as the leading horror writer of our generation, every bit the equal of Lovecraft or Blackwood.&quot; In a 2021 appreciation of his collected works, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said: &quot;Taken together, they constitute one of the monumental accomplishments of modern popular fiction.&quot;

==Overview==

===Early life and work===

Campbell was born in Liverpool, England, to Alexander Ramsey and Nora (Walker) Campbell. He was educated by Christian Brothers at St Edward&#x27;s College, Liverpool. Campbell&#x27;s childhood and adolescence were marked by the rift between his parents, who became estranged shortly after his birth. Campbell&#x27;s father became a shadowy presence more often heard than seen. Campbell states, &quot;I didn&#x27;t see my father face to face for nearly twenty years, and that was when he was dying.&quot; Years later, Campbell&#x27;s mother degenerated into paranoia and schizophrenia, rendering his life a living hell—an experience he has discussed in detail in the introduction and afterword to the restored text of &quot;The Face That Must Die&quot;. Other autobiographical pieces regarding Campbell&#x27;s life are available in Section V, &quot;On Ramsey Campbell&quot; in his essay collection &quot;Ramsey Campbell, Probably: 30 Years of Essays and Articles&quot; (ed. S. T. Joshi), as well as in the novella &quot;The Enigma of the Flat Policeman&quot; (2020).

Campbell&#x27;s mother &quot;wrote a great deal, novel after novel, but was largely unpublished aside from a handful of short stories in writer&#x27;s magazines.&quot; She encouraged her young son to send his writing off from an early age. Growing up in the blitzed landscape of post-war Liverpool, Campbell avidly consumed the work of Lovecraft, Ambrose Bierce, Franz Kafka, Fritz Leiber, Graham Greene, and the cinema of film noir.

===&quot;Ghostly Tales&quot;===

Campbell&#x27;s earliest tales were written when he was 11 years old (1957–58) and were influenced by a magazine from Bolton, Lancashire, called &quot;Phantom&quot;. These early tales formed a self-illustrated collection of sixteen stories and a poem entitled &quot;Ghostly Tales&quot;. Campbell intended to submit these to &quot;Phantom&quot;, but his mother, who regarded literary success as a possible way of financing her escape from her disastrous marriage, persuaded him to wait until he had a whole book to show to publishers. His English teacher, Brother Kelly, used to have him read his stories to the class. Campbell (as John R. Campbell) submitted &quot;Ghostly Tales&quot; to &quot;numerous publishers&quot; including Tom Boardman publisher; Boardman rejected it as they did not publish ghost stories, but his rejection letter included encouragement to Campbell to keep writing. This collection of juvenilia was published thirty years later, as a special issue of &quot;Crypt of Cthulhu&quot; magazine titled &quot;Ghostly Tales: Crypt of Cthulhu&quot; 6, No 8, whole number 50, Michaelmas 1987, edited by Robert M. Price. It is of interest that, though the stories are mostly mainstream spectral lore, one story (&quot;The Hollow in the Woods&quot;) can be considered a very early mythos yarn.

Another issue of this magazine &quot;Crypt of Cthulhu&quot; No 43 (Hallowmas 1983), titled &quot;The Tomb-Herd and Others&quot; collects various early stories, including some early drafts of tales later published revised in Campbell&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants&quot; (Arkham House, 1964). The manuscripts of Campbell&#x27;s early tales are housed at the Local History Library of the Liverpool Public Libraries.

===The influence of H. P. Lovecraft and &quot;The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants&quot;===
Campbell first encountered the works of H. P. Lovecraft at age eight (1954), via the story &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot;, which he found in the Groff Conklin anthology &quot;Strange Travels in Science Fiction&quot;, and within the next few years read &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot; and &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, encountered in the Wise and Fraser anthology &quot;Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural&quot;. At the age of twelve, Campbell attempted to write a novel titled &quot;Broken Moon&quot;, influenced by Arthur Machen, but it petered out after fifty pages. By the age of 14, he discovered Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;Cry Horror!&quot;, a British edition of the collection entitled &quot;The Lurking Fear&quot;, and read it in one day, finding the fiction&#x27;s sense of awesomeness as well as horror extraordinarily appealing. He had also read Arthur Machen&#x27;s major horror stories by this age, and some works by John Dickson Carr, which led him to write, at 14 years old, a 100-page Carr pastiche (unfinished) titled &quot;Murder By Moonlight&quot;. This piece was published in 2020 as &quot;The Enigma of the Flat Policeman&quot;, including annotations from the adult author reflecting on his psychological state at the time of composition. 
On leaving school at age sixteen, Campbell went to work in the Inland Revenue as a tax officer (1962–66). Campbell sold various early stories to editors including August Derleth and Robert A.W. Lowndes. His concept of what was possible in the Weird genre was highly influenced by Lovecraft for the next few years. In December 1961, Campbell completed the story &quot;The Church in High Street&quot; (previously titled &quot;The Tomb-Herd&quot;) which he sent to August Derleth at Arkham House, an imprint singlehandedly responsible for preserving the legacy of H P Lovecraft. Derleth accepted the story in February 1962 and it became Campbell&#x27;s first professionally published tale, appearing in the Derleth-edited anthology &quot;Dark Mind, Dark Heart&quot;. Campbell wrote various other tales of the Cthulhu Mythos between 1961 and 1963. Derleth gave the young writer invaluable advice on improving his writing style (their correspondence has been published in a single volume from PS Publishing).

Forming his literary apprenticeship with stories modelled after Lovecraft&#x27;s themes, Campbell&#x27;s first collection, &quot;The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants&quot; (Arkham House, 1964), published when he was eighteen years old, collects his Lovecraftian pastiches to that date. Campbell has written, &quot;In 1964 I was several kinds of lucky to find a publisher, and one kind depended on my having written a Lovecraftian book for Arkham House, the only publisher likely even to have considered it and one of the very few then to be publishing horror.&quot; The title story of the collection introduces Campbell&#x27;s invention of a tome of occult lore similar to Lovecraft&#x27;s forbidden Necronomicon, &quot;The Revelations of Gla&#x27;aki&quot; (see Books of the Cthulhu Mythos).

===Severn Valley===

The Severn Valley is the setting of several fictional towns and other locations created by Campbell. Part of the Cthulhu Mythos started by Lovecraft, the fictional milieu is arguably the most detailed mythos setting outside of Lovecraft Country itself.

In his early writings, Campbell used the setting of Lovecraft&#x27;s stories, in the fictional New England area of the Miskatonic River valley. At the suggestion of fellow Lovecraftian writer, August Derleth, he rewrote many of his earliest stories, which he had originally set in the Massachusetts locales of Arkham, Dunwich and Innsmouth, and moved them to English settings in and around the fictional Gloucestershire city of Brichester, near the River Severn, creating his own Severn Valley milieu for Lovecraftian horrors. The invented locale of Brichester is the main town of Campbell&#x27;s Severn Valley, and was deeply influenced by Campbell&#x27;s native Liverpool, and much of his later work is set in the real locales of Liverpool and the Merseyside area. The River Severn is an actual river in Wales and western England. Campbell&#x27;s stories mention various real-world locales, including the Cotswold Hills, Berkeley, and the A38 road. These references place &quot;Campbell Country&quot; in the southern part of Gloucestershire, roughly between the cities of Gloucester and Bristol. This area is more correctly referred to as the Vale of Berkeley or the Severn Estuary; the real-world Severn Valley refers to an area around fifty miles (80 km) further north. His later work continued the focus on Liverpool; in particular, his 2005 novel &quot;Secret Stories&quot; (published in the U.S. in an abridged edition as &quot;Secret Story&quot; (2006) both exemplifies and satirizes Liverpudlian speech, characters, humour and culture, while &quot;Creatures of the Pool&quot; draws on the city&#x27;s geography and history.

====Inclusions====
Some of his stories about the fictional Severn Valley can be found in the following anthologies and collections:

===Influence===
The story &quot;Cold Print&quot; (1969) marked an end to Campbell&#x27;s literary apprenticeship, taking the essence of Lovecraft out of the New England backwoods into a modern urban setting. Subsequently Campbell briefly disavowed Lovecraft, whilst working on the radically experimental tales which would be published as the collection &quot;Demons by Daylight.&quot; He later acknowledged Lovecraft&#x27;s lasting influence, and his subsequent Cthulhu Mythos tales, collected in &quot;Cold Print&quot; (1985; expanded in 1993), confirm the transition from pastiche to homage, most notably in such tales as &quot;The Faces at Pine Dunes&quot; and the eerily surreal &quot;The Voice on the Beach&quot; (1982). Later work still seeks to &quot;ascend the cosmic peaks achieved by Lovecraft&quot;, particularly the novel &quot;The Darkest Part of the Woods&quot; (2003), the novella &quot;The Last Revelation of Gla&#x27;aki&quot; (2013), and three novels that form his Brichester Mythos trilogy (2016–18).

===The 1970s: &quot;Determined to be myself&quot;: &quot;Demons by Daylight&quot; and early novels===
With his stories written between 1964 and 1968, beginning with &quot;The Reshaping of Rossiter&quot; (first draft of &quot;The Scar&quot;), &quot;A Garden at Night&quot; (first draft of &quot;Made in Goatswood&quot;) and &quot;The Successor&quot; (first draft of &quot;Cold Print&quot;), Campbell set out to be as unlike Lovecraft as possible. Having discovered writers such as Vladimir Nabokov, Robert Aickman, Graham Greene, Iris Murdoch, William Burroughs and Henry Miller, and such influences as the French &#x27;new novel&#x27;, he became interested in expanding the stylistic possibilities of his work. He finished the collection that would become &quot;Demons by Daylight&quot; in 1968, but it would not see print until 1973. Meanwhile, from 1969 to 1973, he continued to write short stories in which he gradually developed his own voice and themes and left the influence of Lovecraft far behind. Campbell worked in the Liverpool Public Libraries as a library assistant (1966–73) and was acting librarian in charge (1971–73).

In 1969, he had written &quot;Lovecraft in Retrospect&quot;, a violent diatribe against Lovecraft, for the fanzine &quot;Shadow&quot;, &quot;condemning [Lovecraft&#x27;s] work outright.&quot; However, in his 1985 book &quot;Cold Print&quot;, which collects his Lovecraftian stories, Campbell disavowed the opinions expressed in the article, stating: &quot;I believe Lovecraft is one of the most important writers in the field&quot; and &quot;the first book of Lovecraft&#x27;s I read made me into a writer.&quot; Around 1970, Campbell stopped using his first initial &quot;J.&quot; on his work, though a few stories earlier than this appeared as by &quot;Ramsey Campbell&quot;, and a few after still saw print as by &quot;J. Ramsey Campbell&quot;. Campbell later legally changed his name to remove the &quot;John&quot;.

After working four years in the tax office and seven years in public libraries, by 1973, Campbell became a fulltime writer, encouraged by the issuance by Arkham House of his second collection, &quot;Demons by Daylight&quot; (as by Ramsey Campbell). That collection had been due for publication in 1971, but was held back two years by the death of August Derleth. &quot;Demons by Daylight&quot; includes &quot;The Franklyn Paragraphs&quot;, which uses Lovecraft&#x27;s documentary narrative technique without slipping into parody of his writing style. Other tales, such as &quot;The End of a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;Concussion&quot;, show the emergence of Campbell&#x27;s highly distinctive mature style, of which S. T. Joshi has written:

Certainly much of the power of his work derives purely from his prose style, one of the most fluid, dense and evocative in all modern literature [...] His eye for the details and resonances of even the most mundane objects, and his ability to express them crisply and almost prose-poetically, give to his work at once a clarity and a dreamlike nebulousness that is difficult to describe but easy to sense.
The book&#x27;s appearance induced T. E. D. Klein to write an extensive and highly positive review, &quot;Ramsey Campbell: An Appreciation&quot; in &quot;Nyctalops&quot; magazine, and critic S. T. Joshi has stated that:
its [...] allusiveness of narration; careful, at times even obsessive focusing on the fleeting sensations and psychological processes of characters; an aggressively modern setting that allows commentary on social, cultural and political issues&quot;—&quot;all conjoin to make &quot;Demons by Daylight&quot; perhaps the most important book of horror fiction since Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Outsider and Others&quot;.

Campbell has written that &quot;Having completed &quot;Demons by Daylight&quot; in 1968, I felt directionless, and it shows in quite a few of the subsequent tales.&quot; He wrote only four tales in 1970, and five stories in 1971. He has written that &quot;retrospect demonstrates how untimely my decision [to write fulltime] was. Kirby McCauley, now my agent, had to tell me that the market for short horror stories was very limited ... My solution was to lurch into science fiction as best I could. Little of it sold...&quot; Many of the science fiction tales are collected in &quot;Inconsequential Tales&quot; (2008); he also wrote the novella &quot;Medusa&quot; (1973) and the short story &quot;Slow&quot; (collected in &quot;Told by the Dead&quot;), but has stated that his science fiction &quot;tried to deal with Themes, too consciously, I feel&quot;.

Outside the world of horror, he wrote a series of fantasy stories starring Ryre the Swordsman, who battles enemies on an alien world called Tond. Initially published in various anthologies, these stories were finally gathered in the collection &quot;Far Away &amp; Never&quot; (Necronomicon Press, July 1996). In 1976 he &#x27;completed&#x27; three of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s unfinished Solomon Kane stories, &quot;Hawk of Basti&quot;, &quot;The Castle of the Devil&quot; and &quot;The Children of Asshur&quot; (published in 1978 and 1979). By the time Arkham House published his second hardcover collection of horror stories, &quot;The Height of the Scream&quot; (1976), he was beginning to be seen as one of the major modern writers of horror.

1976 also saw the publication of Campbell&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Doll Who Ate His Mother&quot;, which immediately drew acclaim from figures such as Fritz Leiber and T.E.D. Klein. In this and &quot;The Face that Must Die&quot; (1979), Campbell began to fully explore the enigma of evil, touching on the psychological themes of possession, madness and alienation which feature in many of his subsequent novels. He also continued to write short stories, mainly supernatural, receiving the World Fantasy Award for &quot;The Chimney&quot; (1977) and &quot;Mackintosh Willy&quot; (1980).

Campbell has been a lifelong enthusiast of film; early stories such as &quot;The Reshaping of Rossiter&quot; (1964; an early version of &quot;The Scar&quot;) show the influence of directors such as Alain Resnais, and as early as 1969 Campbell had become the film reviewer for BBC Radio Merseyside. He worked in Merseyside on the Friday edition of &quot;Breakfast&quot; and less frequently on Claire Hamilton&#x27;s Sunday show. A longer version of his Merseyside reviews appeared on the Radio Merseyside website, where he also reviewed DVDs. His love of old movies features prominently in two of Campbell&#x27;s later novels, &quot;Ancient Images&quot; and &quot;The Grin of the Dark&quot;.

Campbell wrote novelisations and introductions for a series of novelisations of Universal horror films. The series has a rather complex publishing history. They were published in paperback in 1977 in the US, with uniform packaging, by Berkley Medallion Books as &quot;The Universal Horror Library&quot;. All six of the Berkley editions were published under the house name &#x27;Carl Dreadstone&#x27;; all six of the US editions featured stills from the relevant films. It is believed this set was made available as boxed set in slipcase, as well as sold individually. Only three of the novels were actually written by Campbell, though he contributed introductions to all six volumes. No US hardcover edition of the series is known. Campbell&#x27;s contributions to the series were &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and &quot;The Wolfman&quot;, published as Carl Dreadstone. Three further novelisations which appeared under this house name were not by Campbell but written by other authors. Walter Harris wrote two of the novels: &quot;Werewolf of London&quot; and &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;. The author of the sixth Dreadstone (&quot;The Mummy&quot;) remains unknown. UK editions followed—in 1978, Universal Books (a paperback division of W. H. Allen Ltd) published &quot;The Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (by Campbell) together with Harris&#x27;s &quot;The Werewolf of London&quot; and the (unknown author) &quot;The Mummy&quot; under the &#x27;Carl Dreadstone&#x27; house name, with similar packaging under the title &#x27;The Classic Library of Horror&#x27;. A further two years would elapse before the rest of the series was issued in the UK. The last three of the series were issued by Star Books (a W. H. Allen imprint) in 1980 (with different packaging from the 1978 titles) and these three appeared under a different house-name—&#x27;E. K. Leyton&#x27;. These were Campbell&#x27;s remaining two novels of the series, &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and &quot;The Wolfman&quot;, together with Harris&#x27;s &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;. At least one hardcover omnibus was published, presumably prior to the UK paperbacks: &quot;The Classic Library of Horror Omnibus—The Mummy &amp; The Werewolf of London&quot; (London: Allan Wingate, 1978). Its existence suggests there may have been two companion hardcover omnibuses collecting the balance of the series (if this were the case they would contain the Campbell-authored novels), but their existence/issuance is uncertain. All six of the UK paperbacks and the hardcover omnibus omitted the film stills which appeared in the original US editions.

1979 saw the publication of the non-supernatural thriller &quot;The Face That Must Die&quot;, the story of a homophobic serial killer told largely from the killer&#x27;s point of view. Initially considered by numerous publishers, including Campbell&#x27;s British publisher Thomas Tessier at Millington Books, as too grim to publish, it is regarded by many critics as one of Campbell&#x27;s finest works. The novel was cut by Star Books, who first issued it in a paperback edition in 1979; it was not issued complete until the US Scream Press edition of 1983.

===The 1980s: &quot;The Parasite&quot; to &quot;Ancient Images&quot;===

Campbell became even more prolific during the 1980s, issuing at least eight novels (of which six won awards) and three short story collections. He has written that after moving away from Lovecraft&#x27;s influence he was &quot;determined to sound like myself&quot; but also that &quot;The Chicago and San Francisco tales of Fritz Leiber were now my models in various ways. I wanted to achieve that sense of supernatural terror which derives from the everyday urban landscape rather than invading it, and I greatly admired—still do—how Fritz wrote thoroughly contemporary weird tales which were nevertheless rooted in the best traditions of the field, and which drew some of their strength from uniting British and American influences.&quot;

In 1981, Stephen King published a semi-autobiographical overview of the horror field, &quot;Danse Macabre.&quot; In a chapter focusing on 20th century practitioners, King devoted a section to Campbell&#x27;s fiction, alongside that of Ray Bradbury, Shirley Jackson, Peter Straub, Richard Matheson, Jack Finney and others. On the basis of Campbell&#x27;s earliest work, especially &quot;The Doll Who Ate His Mother&quot;, King argued that the author&#x27;s strength lies in his hallucinogenic prose and edgy psychology, the way his characters view the world and how this affects readers:

In a Campbell novel or story, one seems to view the world through the thin and shifting perceptual haze of an LSD trip that is just ending ... or just beginning. The polish of his writing and his mannered turns of phrase and image make him seem something like the genre&#x27;s Joyce Carol Oates [...] as when journeying on LSD, there is something chilly and faintly schizophrenic in the way his characters see things ... and in the things they see [...] Good stuff. But strange; so uniquely Campbell that it might as well be trademarked.

King also singled out one of Campbell&#x27;s early short stories for particular praise: &quot;The Companion&#x27; may be the best horror tale to be written in the English language in thirty years; it is surely one of the half a dozen or so which will still be in print and commonly read a hundred years from now.&quot; This story appeared in Campbell&#x27;s 1982 collection, &quot;Dark Companions&quot;, alongside other tales from that period commonly cited as early classics: &quot;The Chimney&quot;, &quot;Mackintosh Willy&quot;, and &quot;Call First&quot;.

Starting with &quot;The Parasite&quot; (1980; published in the US with a different ending as &quot;To Wake the Dead&quot;), and continuing throughout much of the decade, Campbell&#x27;s full-length novels were consciously aimed at a more commercial audience. It features a point of view of a female protagonist who becomes embroiled in occult practices (with Lovecraftian undertones). In &quot;The Nameless&quot; (1981), also told from the point of view of a woman, a child goes missing and returns only years later, affiliated to a nefarious organisation. &quot;Obsession&quot; (1982) involves a group of childhood friends making a wish apiece concerning their futures, the manifestations tormenting them in later life; however, as is common in Campbell&#x27;s work involving aberrant mental states, it is not entirely apparent that these events have a supernatural origin. In &quot;Incarnate&quot; (1983), the boundaries between dream and reality are gradually broken down as a group of characters involved in a psychological experiment begin to experience fragmentation in their everyday lives (the novel was written during the &quot;terrible nightmare year&quot; of Campbell&#x27;s mother&#x27;s last mental breakdown).

In &quot;The Claw&quot; (1983; originally published under the pseudonym Jay Ramsey) a family man is tempted by an African talisman to devour his own daughter and in &quot;The Hungry Moon&quot; (1986) a primordial moon entity stokes the religious hysteria of a quiet community. The latter book is a favourite among fans and a multi-character &#x27;small town&#x27; horror story along the lines of similar work in this period, a subgenre arguably &#x27;pump-primed&#x27; by the likes of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;. In characteristically honest and self-critical afterwords, Campbell has claimed that, despite its popularity, &quot;The Hungry Moon,&quot; along with the similarly commercial &quot;The Parasite&quot; and, to a lesser degree, &quot;The Claw&quot;, are among the least successful of his works from this period, by turns awkwardly structured, containing too many ideas, and/or tending towards explicit violence. In contrast Campbell has stated his pride that &quot;The Influence&quot; (1988) and &quot;Ancient Images&quot; (1989) are subtler, tightly plotted novels of supernatural menace, each with (predominantly) female central characters and generating unease through the author&#x27;s trademark suggestiveness and surreal imagery. In 1987, Campbell published &quot;Scared Stiff&quot;, a collection of &quot;sex and horror&quot; short stories.

In the early 1980s Campbell had crossed paths a number of time in Liverpool at cinemas and various parties with a young Liverpool writer named Clive Barker, who had been working around London as a playwright. Barker asked Campbell if he knew any markets for short stories and eventually asked him to look over a soon-to-be-published manuscript and the contract he had been offered for it. Campbell says &quot;My jaw dropped when I looked at the manuscript—it turned out to be the &quot;Books of Blood&quot;.&quot; Campbell wrote the introduction to the first edition.

Campbell contributed numerous articles on horror cinema to &quot;The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural&quot; (1986).

===The 1990s: &quot;Midnight Sun&quot; to &quot;The Last Voice They Hear&quot;===

The 1990s again saw Campbell publish eight novels, though in the second half of this decade he moved away from traditional horror to explore crime and tales of social alienation. Four of this decade&#x27;s novels won awards.

In &quot;Midnight Sun&quot; (1990), an alien entity apparently seeks entry to the world through the mind of a children&#x27;s writer. In its fusion of horror with awe, &quot;Midnight Sun&quot; shows the influence of Algernon Blackwood and Arthur Machen as well as Lovecraft. It is one that many enthusiasts single out as a highlight of this stage of his career. &quot;Needing Ghosts&quot; (1990), a novella, is a nightmarish work that blends the horrific and the comic; Campbell himself has described the composition of this piece as unique among his work in that it &quot;felt like dreaming on the page&quot; and was written relatively quickly without technical or structural challenges.

A sympathetic serial murderer appears in the black comedy &quot;The Count of Eleven&quot; (1991), which displays Campbell&#x27;s gift for word play, and which the author has said is disturbing &quot;because it doesn&#x27;t stop being funny when you think it should&quot;. A review at the time suggested that the central character might be played in a film by Stan Laurel, an observation that delighted Campbell, who is a great admirer of Laurel and Hardy. Other novels of this decade include &quot;The Long Lost&quot; (1993), in which a sin-eater is discovered by a couple holidaying in Wales and brought home ostensibly as a relative, with considerable impact on a community. A haunted house novel called &quot;The House on Nazareth Hill&quot; (1996), combining the author&#x27;s M R Jamesian suggestiveness with an increasingly idiosyncratic prose style, is a study of familial psychology and the unchanging nature of social processes, particularly those relating to the young&#x27;s quest for independence and the threat this presents to others.

Campbell had earlier published a non-supernatural novel called &quot;The One Safe Place&quot; (1995), which uses a highly charged thriller narrative to examine social problems such as the deprivation and abuse of children, and in 1998 he turned away for a more sustained period from the supernatural work with which he was associated. By this time, horror had become commercially less successful and publishers were taking fewer chances on publishing such material, all of which encouraged Campbell to write a number of crimes novels. The first, &quot;The Last Voice They Hear&quot; (1998), is a tightly plotted thriller which ranges back and forth in time as two brothers become engaged in a cat-and-mouse game redolent of earlier events in their lives. Although written &quot;under protest&quot;, Campbell came to think of the book, during composition, as bearing his own stamp, and his next two novels were also non-supernatural.

In this decade Campbell issued four short story collections, including, in 1993, the 30-year career retrospective &quot;Alone with the Horrors: The Great Short Fiction of Ramsey Campbell 1961-1991&quot;, published by Campbell&#x27;s original publisher, Arkham House. This volume, illustrated by Jeff K. Potter, is not a comprehensive collection of all the stories Campbell had published in those thirty years, rather 39 tales which Campbell and his editor Jim Turner thought representative. Drawing on material across his career to that date, it is considered a good entry point for readers unfamiliar with his work. &quot;Waking Nightmares&quot; (1991), &quot;Strange Things and Stranger Places&quot; (1993), and &quot;Ghosts and Grisly Things&quot; (1998) collect much of Campbell&#x27;s short fiction from this period. Two of this decade&#x27;s short story collections won awards.

In 1999, Campbell was awarded both the Grand Master Award from the World Horror Convention and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Horror Writers Association.

===The 2000s: &quot;Silent Children&quot; to &quot;Creatures of the Pool&quot;===
In the &quot;noughties&quot;, Campbell continued his prolific output, publishing multiple novels, along with three short story collections. He reviewed films and DVDs weekly for BBC Radio Merseyside until 2007, and began to contribute a monthly film column, &quot;Ramsey&#x27;s Ramblings&quot;, for &quot;Video Watchdog&quot; magazine. In 2002, PS Publishing issued a collection of Campbell&#x27;s essays on horror and other areas of interest: &quot;Ramsey Campbell, Probably&quot; (this volume was expanded to include further material in a 2014 reprint). The collection includes book reviews, film reviews, autobiographical writings and other nonfiction, along with reminiscences and appreciations of authors such as John Brunner, Bob Shaw and K. W. Jeter, and an extensive, negative critique of Shaun Hutson&#x27;s &quot;Heathen&quot;, parodying Hutson&#x27;s style.

Following the publication of two more crime novels—&quot;Silent Children&quot; (2000), the story of an eccentric child killer; and &quot;Pact of the Fathers&quot; (2001), which draws on arcane religious practices—Campbell returned to the supernatural and otherworldly. &quot;The Darkest Part of the Woods&quot; (2003) successfully evokes the cosmic terrors of H P Lovecraft and was the first of Campbell&#x27;s work published by PS Publishing; the author would go on to enjoy a long-term relationship with the UK imprint, granting first print rights to most new work. Having spent a number of months working full-time in a Borders store, Campbell wrote &quot;The Overnight&quot; (2004), about bookshop staff trapped in their hellish workplace during an overnight shift. In &quot;Secret Stories&quot; (2005; abridged US edition, &quot;Secret Story&quot;, 2006) Campbell returned to the crime genre with a blackly comic study of a serial killer whose written accounts of his crimes inadvertently win a fiction competition, resulting in further murders.

&quot;The Grin of the Dark&quot; (2007) draws on Campbell&#x27;s interest in the history of cinema, as a character seeks material relating to a silent film comedian by the name of Tubby Thackeray. The novel also explores the impact of the internet on human consciousness. The author, often critical of his own output, continues to cite this novel as one with which he remains pleased. &quot;Thieving Fear&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Creatures of the Pool&quot; (2009) use locations in and around the author&#x27;s native Liverpool to eerie effect.

&quot;Told by the Dead&quot; (2003) and &quot;Just Behind You&quot; (2009) collected Campbell&#x27;s short fiction, while &quot;Inconsequential Tales&quot; (2008), collecting a number of unpublished stories, documents his early evolution as a stylist.

In 2007, Campbell was awarded the Living Legend Award from the International Horror Guild.

=== The 2010: &quot;The Seven Days of Cain&quot; to the &quot;Brichester Mythos Trilogy&quot; ===

After 2010, Campbell continued to publish at least a book a year, including a collection of letters from his early career between himself and his first mentor August Derleth (&quot;Letters to Arkham: The Letters of Ramsey Campbell and August Derleth, 1961-1971&quot;, ed. S. T. Joshi, 2014) .

Both &quot;The Seven Days of Cain&quot; (2010) and &quot;Think Yourself Lucky&quot; (2014) explore use of the internet, as characters originally appearing online start to impact upon the real world with disconcerting effects. In 2010, Campbell was commissioned to write the novelisation of the movie &quot;Solomon Kane,&quot; which was based on the swords and sorcery stories of Robert E. Howard (some of which Campbell had completed in his early career)&quot;.&quot; &quot;Ghosts Know&quot; (2011), one of the author&#x27;s few latter-day non-supernatural excursions (on the surface, at least), explores the mendacity of stage mediums/psychics in the context of a missing person story; it also showcases a later development in the Campbell&#x27;s work, social comedy and confusions inherent in everyday communication. &quot;The Kind Folk&quot; (2012) is a delicately written evocation of fairy folk, told in the modern day.

In 2013, &quot;Holes for Faces&quot;, a further collection of short fiction appeared, gathering together his work from the 2000s. During the same period, PS Publishing issued two novellas by Campbell: &quot;The Last Revelation of Gla&#x27;aki&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Pretence&quot; (2013). A third novella appeared in 2016 entitled &quot;The Booking,&quot; from Dark Regions Press. These were the first novellas Campbell had written since 1990&#x27;s &quot;Needing Ghosts&quot;. 2015 saw the release of &quot;Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach&quot;, one of Campbell&#x27;s few novels set outside the UK; a family holiday on a Greek island involves communion with a familiar supernatural character from literature. Campbell&#x27;s collection of playful limericks based on famous horror works of fiction appeared in 2016: &quot;Limericks of the Alarming and Phantasmal.&quot;

&quot;The Searching Dead&quot; (2016) was the first novel in a trilogy of H P Lovecraft-influenced works which, like the novella &quot;The Last Revelation of Gla&#x27;aki,&quot; revisits themes from Campbell&#x27;s early work. Described by the author as his &quot;Brichester Mythos trilogy&quot;, the three-book series, including &quot;Born to the Dark&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Way of the Worm&quot; (2018), documents a character&#x27;s engagement with a nefarious organisation over three time periods (1950s, 1980s, 2010s) and evokes a cosmic entity by the name of Daoloth. The trilogy draws together multiple themes that have preoccupied the author during his whole career: the cosmic, family, scapegoating, the vulnerability of children, and the seductiveness of totalising belief systems.

A new short story collection, &quot;By the Light of my Skull,&quot; was also released in 2018, some stories deal with older age. &quot;Visions from Brichester&quot; (2017) collected all of the author&#x27;s Lovecraftian short fiction not originally published in &quot;The Inhabitant of the Lake&quot;. PS Publishing issued the first of a two-volume retrospective focused on Campbell&#x27;s most representative short fiction across his entire career: &quot;The Companion &amp; Other Phantasmagorical Stories&quot; (2019).

In 2015, Campbell received the World Fantasy Award&#x27;s Life Award, and in 2017, in Spain, he was awarded the Premio Sheridan Le Fanu for his career achievements. In 2015, the author received an Honorary Fellowship from John Moores University, Liverpool, for &quot;outstanding services to literature&quot;.

=== The 2020s: &quot;The Wise Friend&quot; to present ===
&quot;The Wise Friend&quot; was published in spring 2020 by new publisher Flame Tree Press (which has also reissued earlier Campbell novels in hardcover, paperback, ebook, and audiobook). Among the quietest of the author&#x27;s work, this novel draws on folk horror as a father seeks to protect his son who has become involved with a legacy with occult overtones. A new novella, &quot;The Enigma of the Flat Policeman,&quot; part of Borderlands Press&#x27;s Little Book series (in this case, &quot;A Little Green Book of Grins &amp; Gravity&quot;), was released in March 2020. It consists of an incomplete short detective novel the author wrote aged 14 in imitation of John Dickson Carr, with annotations exploring the adult author&#x27;s perceptions of his younger self&#x27;s psychological state at the time of composition. The second volume of PS Publishing&#x27;s career retrospective, &quot;The Retrospective &amp; Other Phantasmagorical Stories,&quot; was published in late 2020. Another Campbell career retrospective (with a different selection of tales) appeared in 2020 from Centipede Press as part of their &quot;Masters of the Weird Tale&quot; series, also issued in two volumes.

In July 2021, Flame Tree Press released &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Voice&quot;, a non-supernatural thriller novel which focuses on themes of identity, memory, and mental disintegration; after an author ghost-writes a memoir, his grip on reality slides when the truth turns out to be less assured than he was led to believe. A third volume in PS Publishing&#x27;s career retrospective series, &quot;Needing Ghosts &amp; Other Novellas&quot;, was published in 2021; the book collects all of the author&#x27;s novellas to date and includes a new novella, &quot;The Village Killings&quot;. Also in 2021, a new edition of the author&#x27;s sword and sorcery collection &quot;Far Away and Never&quot; was published (by DMR Books), including an extra story. In the same year, Dark Moon Books published a Campbell edition of their primer series (&quot;Exploring Dark Fiction&quot; &quot;#6: A Primer to Ramsey Campbell,&quot; which includes a new short story), while PS Publishing also released a new expanded edition of the author&#x27;s collected essays, &quot;Ramsey Campbell, Certainly.&quot; In 2023, PS Publishing published a new short story collection by Campbell called &quot;Fearful Implications,&quot; along with his personal tribute to The Third Stooges, &quot;Six Stooges and Counting&quot;. 

Campbell&#x27;s 2022 novel &quot;Fellstones&quot; is oriented around the author&#x27;s love of classical music and is squarely in the tradition of British folk horror, as a young man suffers in later life unwanted attention from a family that adopted him in childhood and that still lives in a village occupied by seven standing stones; the novel is a return to themes of cosmicism. Campbell latest novel, &quot;The Lonely Lands&quot;, explores themes of the afterlife as a man loses his wife to Covid and experiences communications from her after death. But other less welcome people also return and he must do what he can to protect her from them. Campbell&#x27;s 2025 novel, &quot;The Incubations&quot;, focuses on post-WWII Anglo-German relations as young man who had a childhood penfriend in Germany gets involved in a myth that infects his homecoming after a trip abroad. Campbell completed a new novel entitled &quot;An Echo of Children&quot; and is working on another called &quot;The Ancestral&quot;.

=== Style and themes ===
Campbell&#x27;s style is characterised by an idiosyncratic use of language. His fictional worlds feel unusual, threatening, and dislocated. Such an approach prompted Peter Straub to write in a blurb for one of Campbell&#x27;s early novels: &quot;Horrors in his fiction are never merely invented, they are felt and experienced, and affect the reader for days afterward.&quot; The horrors Campbell evokes are commonly suggested to the reader by ambiguous allusions to events his characters are not always mindful of. In this regard, his approach is similar to that of M. R. James. Indeed, Campbell celebrates James&#x27;s concentrated prose, choice of detail, and ability to hint at disquieting material much larger than what is explicitly revealed. Campbell has described much of his own later work as &quot;comedies of paranoia&quot;, as his characters experience an existential bewilderment that borders on the absurd.

Campbell himself has cited the following themes as recurrent in his work: &quot;the vulnerability of children, the willingness of people to espouse a belief system that denies them the right to question, and the growing tendency to create scapegoats for the ills of the world.&quot; However, his work has addressed a wide range of issues, including censorship (e.g., &quot;The One Safe Place&quot;, 1995), the impact of the internet on consciousness (e.g., &quot;The Grin of the Dark&quot;, 2007; &quot;The Seven Days of Cain&quot;, 2010; &quot;Think Yourself Lucky&quot;, 2014), corporation-led consumerism (the recurrence of a global organisation called Frugo in his later work, especially &quot;The Overnight&quot;, 2004, and &quot;Thieving Fear&quot;, 2008), fatherhood (&quot;The House on Nazareth Hill&quot;, 1996), and older age (&quot;Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach&quot;, 2015). Abnormal human psychology is also a major recurring theme in Campbell&#x27;s work (e.g., &quot;The Face That Must Die&quot;, 1979; &quot;The Count of Eleven&quot;, 1991; &quot;The Last Voice They Hear&quot;, 1998; &quot;Secret Stories&quot;, 2005; &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Voice&quot;, 2021).

===Tributes===

Four tribute anthologies of stories inspired by Campbell&#x27;s work have been released to date. The first was the 1995 anthology &quot;Made in Goatswood&quot; (Chaosium, edited by Scott David Aniolowski), which includes a story by Campbell himself. &quot;The Children of Gla&#x27;aki&quot; (2016, Dark Regions Press, edited by Brian M. Sammons and Glynn Owen Barrass) consists of stories focused on one of Campbell&#x27;s Lovecraftian creations, and &quot;Darker Companions&quot; (2017, PS Publishing, edited by Joe Pulver and Scott David Aniolowski) contains tales inspired by the author&#x27;s vision and prose. In Spain, a further tribute anthology appeared entitled &quot;El Horror Que Vino del Sur: Un Tributo Latino a Ramsey Campbell Y Al Circulo de Lovecraft&quot; (2018, Bookbaby). All four books demonstrate Campbell&#x27;s influence in the field on both established and newer writers. In 2021, &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; magazine published a special edition (#4) devoted to Campbell&quot;s work, boasting many critiques and tributes from his peers.

In 2012, Campbell attracted a spoof collection of horror stories edited by fellow writer Rhys Hughes. Hughes contributed a good deal of the fictional content, including the pieces focused on an author called Lamblake Heinz, clearly a parody of Campbell (although Hughes has admitted elsewhere that he has read little if any of Campbell&#x27;s work).

===Films===

Three of Campbell&#x27;s novels have been adapted into films to date, all in Spain. Jaume Balagueró&#x27;s &quot;The Nameless&quot; (in Spanish &quot;Los Sin Nombre&quot;; in Catalan &quot;Els sense nom&quot;), based on the novel of the same name, takes some liberties with the source material&#x27;s plot but captures its pungent atmosphere. Paco Plaza&#x27;s &quot;Second Name&quot; (&quot;El Segundo Nombre&quot; in Spanish) based on the novel &quot;The Pact of the Fathers&quot;, similarly evokes Campbell&#x27;s paranoiac fictional world, its story rooted in the world of arcane religious practices. Denis Rovira van Boekholt&#x27;s &quot;The Influence&quot; (&quot;La Influencia&quot; in Spanish), based on the Campbell novel of the same name and quite faithful (except for changes in the final third), was released in 2019 and was later picked up by Netflix to stream. It was announced in 2020 that a TV series based on &quot;The Nameless&quot; is in development under the stewardship of Jaume Balagueró and Pau Freixas.

===Books edited===

Campbell has edited a number of anthologies, including &quot;New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos&quot; (1980); &quot;New Terrors&quot; and &quot;New Terrors II&quot;, a groundbreaking two-volume anthology series; and (with Stephen Jones) the first five volumes of the annual &quot;Best New Horror&quot; series (1990–1994). His 1992 anthology &quot;Uncanny Banquet&quot; was notable for including the first ever reprint of the obscure 1914 horror novel &quot;The Hole of the Pit&quot; by Adrian Ross. &quot;The Gruesome Book&quot; was a paperback anthology of horror tales for children. Campbell is extremely well-read in the horror field, and some of his own literary influences are demonstrated by his selections for the 1988 anthology &quot;Fine Frights: Stories That Scared Me&quot;. In 2002 he edited a collection of fiction in the tradition of M. R. James, entitled &quot;Meddling with Ghosts&quot;. His 2003 anthology &quot;Gathering the Bones&quot; (co-edited with Dennis Etchison and Jack Dann) draws together tales from the UK, US, and Australia. &quot;The Folio Book of Horror Stories&quot; (2018), the first collection Campbell had edited in 15 years, draws together classic tales from the last 200 years.

===Personal life===

Campbell married Jenny Chandler, daughter of A. Bertram Chandler, on 1 January 1971. He commonly describes his wife as the &quot;best part&quot; of himself. At various stages of his career—for instance, when he first decided to write on a full-time basis—he received support from Jenny, who worked as a teacher. They have two children, Tamsin (born 1978) and Matthew (born 1981). Campbell is a life-long resident of Merseyside. He is fond of fine dining, travel, and classical music. He is very active as a public speaker and greatly enjoys giving readings of his fiction at literary events. Campbell is eloquent and jolly (a persona he self-effacingly describes as a &quot;facade&quot;), and he has claimed that if he hadn&#x27;t become a horror writer, he might have been a stand-up comedian.

In response to an interview question about religion, Campbell has stated, &quot;As I got older I&#x27;m more Agnostic [...] [a] little religious perspective is no bad thing; I have no set belief.&quot; He added, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there is any supernatural force out there to make you do stuff.&quot; When asked whether he believes in the supernatural he claims to have experienced episodes that might be described as involving such activity; however, he remains noncommittal on this issue, stating that he writes about such material because he finds it &quot;imaginatively appealing&quot; and to &quot;repay&quot; the genre for many treasured reading experiences. Campbell is fiercely opposed to censorship, claiming that the suppression of contentious material can result in it returning in an even worse form. He has been very generous in support of newer writers, frequently writing introductions to their work.

For many years Campbell was the President of the British Fantasy Society.

<text>The Moscow Metro is a metro system serving the Russian capital of Moscow as well as the neighbouring cities of Krasnogorsk, Reutov, Lyubertsy and Kotelniki in Moscow Oblast. Opened in 1935 with one line and 13 stations, it was the first underground railway system in the Soviet Union.

, the Moscow Metro has 271 stations and of route length, excluding light rail Monorail, making it the 8th-longest in the world, the longest in Europe and the longest outside China. It is also the only system in Russia with two circle lines. The system is mostly underground, with the deepest section underground at the Park Pobedy station, one of the world&#x27;s deepest underground stations. It is the busiest metro system in Europe, the busiest in the world outside Asia, and is considered a tourist attraction in itself, thanks to its lavish interior decoration. 

The Moscow Metro is a world leader in the frequency of train traffic, as intervals during peak hours often do not exceed 90 seconds. In February 2023, Moscow was the first in the world to reduce the intervals of metro trains to 80 seconds, but in practice trains are not likely to exceed the 90 seconds interval.
==Name==
The full legal name of the metro has been Moscow Order of Lenin and Order of the Red Banner of Labor V. I. Lenin Metro () since 1955. This is usually shortened to V. I. Lenin Metro (). This shorter official name appears on many stations. Although there were proposals to remove Lenin from the official name, it still stands. During the 1990s and 2000s, Lenin&#x27;s name was excluded from the signage on newly built and reconstructed stations. In 2016, a Metro representative stated that Lenin&#x27;s name would remain on station name plates as it aligns with the official name of the company, unchanged since the Soviet era.

The first official name of the metro was L. M. Kaganovich Metro () after Lazar Kaganovich (see &quot;History&quot; section). However, when the Metro was awarded the Order of Lenin, it was officially renamed Moscow Order of Lenin L. M. Kaganovich Metro () in 1947. When the metro was renamed in 1955, the Okhotny Ryad station was renamed as &quot;Imeni Kaganovicha&quot; in honor of Lazar Kaganovich. In 1957, the original &quot;Okhotny Ryad&quot; name of the station was reinstated.

==Logo==
The first line of the Moscow Metro was launched in 1935, complete with the first logo, the capital M paired with the text &quot;МЕТРО&quot;. There is no accurate information about the author of the logo, so it is often attributed to the architects of the first stations – Samuil Kravets, Ivan Taranov and Nadezhda Bykova. At the opening in 1935, the M letter on the logo had no definite shape.

In 2014, the Moscow Metro adopted a standardized logo of the network as part of a broader rebranding of the Moscow Transport.

==Operations==
The Moscow Metro, a state-owned enterprise, is long and consists of 15 lines and 263 stations organized in a spoke-hub distribution paradigm, with the majority of rail lines running radially from the centre of Moscow to the outlying areas. The Koltsevaya Line (line 5) forms a long circle which enables passenger travel between these diameters, and the new Moscow Central Circle (line 14) and even newer Bolshaya Koltsevaya line (line 11) form a and long circles respectively that serve a similar purpose on middle periphery. Most stations and lines are underground, but some lines have at-grade and elevated sections; the Filyovskaya Line, Butovskaya Line and the Central Circle Line are the three lines that are at grade or mostly at grade.

The Moscow Metro uses , like other Russian railways, and an underrunning third rail with a supply of 825 Volts DC, except lines 13 and 14, the former being a monorail, and the latter being directly connected to the mainlines with 3000V DC overhead lines, as is typical. The average distance between stations is ; the shortest ( long) section is between Delovoy Tsentr and Mezhdunarodnaya, and the longest ( long) is between Krylatskoye and Strogino. Long distances between stations have the positive effect of a high cruising speed of .

The Moscow Metro opens at 05:25 and closes at 01:00. The exact opening time varies at different stations according to the arrival of the first train, but all stations simultaneously close their entrances at 01:00 for maintenance, and so do transfer corridors. The minimum interval between trains is 90 seconds during the morning and evening rush hours.

As of 2017, the system had an average daily ridership of 6.99 million passengers. Peak daily ridership of 9.71 million was recorded on 26 December 2014.

Free Wi-Fi has been available on all lines of the Moscow Metro since 2 December 2014.

==Network==


=== Lines ===
Each line is identified by a name, an alphanumeric index (usually consisting of just a number, and sometimes a letter suffix), and a colour. The colour assigned to each line is its colloquial identifier, except for the nondescript greens and blues assigned to the Bolshaya Koltsevaya, the Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya, and Butovskaya lines (lines 11, 10, and 12, respectively). The upcoming station is announced by a male voice on inbound trains to the city center (on the Circle line, the clockwise trains), and by a female voice on outbound trains (anti-clockwise trains on the Circle line).

The metro has a connection to the Moscow Monorail, a , six-station monorail line between Timiryazevskaya and VDNKh which opened in January 2008. Prior to the official opening, the monorail had operated in &quot;excursion mode&quot; since 2004.


Also, from 11 August 1969 to 26 October 2019, the Moscow Metro included Kakhovskaya line long with 3 stations, which closed for a long reconstruction. On 7 December 2021, Kakhovskaya is reopened after reconstruction as part of the Bolshaya Koltsevaya line. The renewed Varshavskaya and Kashirskaya stations reopened as part of the Bolshaya Koltsevaya line, which became fully functional on 1 March 2023. Its new stations included Pechatniki, Nagatinsky Zaton and Klenovy Bulvar.

=== Renamed lines ===
* Sokolnicheskaya line was previously named Kirovsko-Fruzenskaya
* Zamoskvoretskaya line was previously named Gorkovsko-Zamoskvoretskaya.
* Filyovskaya line was previously named Arbatsko-Filyovskaya.
* Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya line was previously named Zhdanovsko-Krasnopresnenskaya

==History==

The first plans for a metro system in Moscow date back to the Russian Empire but were postponed by World War I, the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. In 1923, the Moscow City Council formed the Underground Railway Design Office at the Moscow Board of Urban Railways. It carried out preliminary studies, and by 1928 had developed a project for the first route from Sokolniki to the city centre. At the same time, an offer was made to the German company Siemens Bauunion to submit its own project for the same route. In June 1931, the decision to begin construction of the Moscow Metro was made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In January 1932 the plan for the first lines was approved, and on 21 March 1933 the Soviet government approved a plan for 10 lines with a total route length of .

The first lines were built using the Moscow general plan designed by Lazar Kaganovich, along with his project managers (notably Ivan M. Kuznetsov and, later, Isaac Y. Segal) in the 1930s–1950s, and the Metro was named after him until 1955 &quot;()&quot;. The Moscow Metro construction engineers consulted with their counterparts from the London Underground, the world&#x27;s oldest metro system, in 1936: British architect Charles Holden and administrator Frank Pick had been working on the station developments of the Piccadilly Line extension, and Soviet delegates to London were impressed by Holden&#x27;s thoroughly modern redeployment of classical elements and use of high-quality materials for the circular ticket hall of Piccadilly Circus, and so engaged Pick and Holden as advisors to Moscow&#x27;s metro system. Partly because of this connection, the design of Gants Hill tube station, which was completed in 1947, is reminiscent of a Moscow Metro station. Indeed, Holden&#x27;s homage to Moscow has been described as a gesture of gratitude for the USSR&#x27;s helpful role in The Second World War.

Soviet workers did the labour and the art work, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from London Underground. The British called for tunnelling instead of the &quot;cut-and-cover&quot; technique, the use of escalators instead of lifts, the routes and the design of the rolling stock. The paranoia of the NKVD was evident when the secret police arrested numerous British engineers for espionage because they gained an in-depth knowledge of the city&#x27;s physical layout. Engineers for the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company (Metrovick) were given a show trial and deported in 1933, ending the role of British business in the USSR.

===First four stages of construction===

The first line was opened to the public on 15 May 1935 at 07:00 am. It was long and included 13 stations. The day was celebrated as a technological and ideological victory for socialism (and, by extension, Stalinism). An estimated 285,000 people rode the Metro at its debut, and its design was greeted with pride; street celebrations included parades, plays and concerts. The Bolshoi Theatre presented a choral performance by 2,200 Metro workers; 55,000 colored posters (lauding the Metro as the busiest and fastest in the world) and 25,000 copies of &quot;Songs of the Joyous Metro Conquerors&quot; were distributed. The Moscow Metro averaged and had a top speed of . In comparison, New York City Subway trains averaged a slower and had a top speed of . While the celebration was an expression of popular joy it was also an effective propaganda display, legitimizing the Metro and declaring it a success.

The initial line connected Sokolniki to Okhotny Ryad then branching to Park Kultury and Smolenskaya. The latter branch was extended westwards to a new station (Kiyevskaya) in March 1937, the first Metro line crossing the Moskva River over the Smolensky Metro Bridge.

The second stage was completed before the war. In March 1938, the Arbatskaya branch was split and extended to the Kurskaya station (now the dark-blue Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line). In September 1938, the Gorkovskaya Line opened between Sokol and Teatralnaya. Here the architecture was based on that of the most popular stations in existence (Krasniye Vorota, Okhotnyi Ryad and Kropotkinskaya); while following the popular art-deco style, it was merged with socialist themes. The first deep-level column station Mayakovskaya was built at the same time.

Building work on the third stage was delayed (but not interrupted) during World War II, and two Metro sections were put into service; Teatralnaya–Avtozavodskaya (three stations, crossing the Moskva River through a deep tunnel) and Kurskaya–Partizanskaya (four stations) were inaugurated in 1943 and 1944 respectively. War motifs replaced socialist visions in the architectural design of these stations. During the Siege of Moscow in the fall and winter of 1941, Metro stations were used as air-raid shelters; the Council of Ministers moved its offices to the Mayakovskaya platforms, where Stalin made public speeches on several occasions. The Chistiye Prudy station was also walled off, and the headquarters of the Air Defence established there.

After the war ended in 1945, construction began on the fourth stage of the Metro, which included the Koltsevaya Line, a deep part of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line from Ploshchad Revolyutsii to Kievskaya and a surface extension to Pervomaiskaya during the early 1950s. The decoration and design characteristic of the Moscow Metro is considered to have reached its zenith in these stations. The Koltsevaya Line was first planned as a line running under the Garden Ring, a wide avenue encircling the borders of Moscow&#x27;s city centre. The first part of the line – from Park Kultury to Kurskaya (1950) – follows this avenue. Plans were later changed and the northern part of the ring line runs outside the Sadovoye Koltso, thus providing service for seven (out of nine) rail terminals. The next part of the Koltsevaya Line opened in 1952 (Kurskaya–Belorusskaya), and in 1954 the ring line was completed.

==== Stalinist ideals in Metro&#x27;s history ====

When the Metro opened in 1935, it immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system (as opposed to horse-carried barrows still widely used in 1930s Moscow). It also became the prototype, the vision for future Soviet large-scale technologies. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and physical prowess on the powerful new &quot;Homo Sovieticus&quot; (Soviet man). The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social ordera sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.

The Metro was also iconic for showcasing Socialist Realism in public art. The method was influenced by Nikolay Chernyshevsky, Lenin&#x27;s favorite 19th-century nihilist, who stated that &quot;art is no useful unless it serves politics&quot;. This maxim sums up the reasons why the stations combined aesthetics, technology and ideology: any plan which did not incorporate all three areas cohesively was rejected.
* &quot;Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. Without this cohesion, the Metro would not reflect Socialist Realism. If the Metro did not utilize Socialist Realism, it would fail to illustrate Stalinist values and transform Soviet citizens into socialists. Anything less than Socialist Realism&#x27;s grand artistic complexity would fail to inspire a long-lasting, nationalistic attachment to Stalin&#x27;s new society.&quot; 
* Socialist Realism was in fact a method, not exactly a style.

==== &quot;Bright future&quot; and literal brightness in the Metro of Moscow ====
The Moscow Metro was one of the USSR&#x27;s most ambitious architectural projects. The metro&#x27;s artists and architects worked to design a structure that embodied &quot;svet&quot; (literally &quot;light&quot;, figuratively &quot;radiance&quot; or &quot;brilliance&quot;) and &quot;svetloe budushchee&quot; (a well-lit/radiant/bright future). With their reflective marble walls, high ceilings and grand chandeliers, many Moscow Metro stations have been likened to an &quot;artificial underground sun&quot;.

This palatial underground environment reminded Metro users their taxes were spent on materializing &quot;bright future&quot;; also, the design was useful for demonstrating the extra structural strength of the underground works (as in Metro doubling as bunkers, bomb shelters).

The chief lighting engineer was Abram Damsky, a graduate of the Higher State Art-Technical Institute in Moscow. By 1930 he was a chief designer in Moscow&#x27;s Elektrosvet Factory, and during World War II was sent to the &quot;Metrostroi&quot; (Metro Construction) Factory as head of the lighting shop. Damsky recognized the importance of efficiency, as well as the potential for light as an expressive form. His team experimented with different materials (most often cast bronze, aluminum, sheet brass, steel, and milk glass) and methods to optimize the technology. Damsky&#x27;s discourse on &quot;Lamps and Architecture 1930–1950&quot; describes in detail the epic chandeliers installed in the Taganskaya Station and the Kaluzhskaia station (&quot;Oktyabrskaya&quot; nowadays, not to be confused with contemporary &quot;Kaluzhskaya&quot; station on line 6). The work of Abram Damsky further publicized these ideas hoping people would associate the party with the idea of &quot;bright&quot; future.

====Industrialization====
Stalin&#x27;s first five-year plan (1928–1932) facilitated rapid industrialization to build a socialist motherland. The plan was ambitious, seeking to reorient an agrarian society towards industrialism. It was Stalin&#x27;s fanatical energy, large-scale planning, and resource distribution that kept up the pace of industrialization. The first five-year plan was instrumental in the completion of the Moscow Metro; without industrialization, the Soviet Union would not have had the raw materials necessary for the project. For example, steel was a main component of many subway stations. Before industrialization, it would have been impossible for the Soviet Union to produce enough steel to incorporate it into the metro&#x27;s design; in addition, a steel shortage would have limited the size of the subway system and its technological advancement.

The Moscow Metro furthered the construction of a socialist Soviet Union because the project accorded with Stalin&#x27;s second five-year plan. The Second Plan focused on urbanization and the development of social services. The Moscow Metro was necessary to cope with the influx of peasants who migrated to the city during the 1930s; Moscow&#x27;s population had grown from 2.16 million in 1928 to 3.6 million in 1933. The Metro also bolstered Moscow&#x27;s shaky infrastructure and its communal services, which hitherto were nearly nonexistent.

====Mobilization====
The Communist Party had the power to mobilize; because the party was a single source of control, it could focus its resources. The most notable example of mobilization in the Soviet Union occurred during World War II. The country also mobilized in order to complete the Moscow Metro with unprecedented speed. One of the main motivation factors of the mobilization was to overtake the West and prove that a socialist metro could surpass capitalist designs. It was especially important to the Soviet Union that socialism succeed industrially, technologically, and artistically in the 1930s, since capitalism was at a low ebb during the Great Depression.

The person in charge of Metro mobilization was Lazar Kaganovich. A prominent Party member, he assumed control of the project as chief overseer. Kaganovich was nicknamed the &quot;Iron Commissar&quot;; he shared Stalin&#x27;s fanatical energy, dramatic oratory flare, and ability to keep workers building quickly with threats and punishment. He was determined to realise the Moscow Metro, regardless of cost. Without Kaganovich&#x27;s managerial ability, the Moscow Metro might have met the same fate as the Palace of the Soviets: failure.
This was a comprehensive mobilization; the project drew resources and workers from the entire Soviet Union. In his article, archeologist Mike O&#x27;Mahoney describes the scope of the Metro mobilization:

Skilled engineers were scarce, and unskilled workers were instrumental to the realization of the metro. The &quot;Metrostroi&quot; (the organization responsible for the Metro&#x27;s construction) conducted massive recruitment campaigns. It printed 15,000 copies of &quot;Udarnik metrostroia&quot; (&quot;Metrostroi Shock Worker&quot;, its daily newspaper) and 700 other newsletters (some in different languages) to attract unskilled laborers. Kaganovich was closely involved in the recruitment campaign, targeting the Komsomol generation because of its strength and youth.

=== Later Soviet stations ===

==== &quot;Fifth stage&quot; set of stations ====
The beginning of the Cold War led to the construction of a deep section of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line. The stations on this line were planned as shelters in the event of nuclear war. After finishing the line in 1953 the upper tracks between Ploshchad Revolyutsii and Kiyevskaya were closed, and later reopened in 1958 as a part of the Filyovskaya Line. The stations, too, were supplied with tight gates and life-sustenance systems to function as proper nuclear shelters.

In the further development of the Metro the term &quot;stages&quot; was not used any more, although sometimes the stations opened in 1957–1959 are referred to as the &quot;fifth stage&quot;.
==== Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s era of cost cutting ====
During the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s, the architectural extravagance of new Metro stations was decisively rejected on the orders of Nikita Khrushchev. He had a preference for a utilitarian &quot;minimalism&quot;-like approach to design, similar to Brutalism style. The idea behind the rejection was similar to one used to create Khrushchyovkas: cheap yet easily mass-produced buildings. Stations of his era, as well as most 1970s stations, were simple in design and style, with walls covered with identical square ceramic tiles. Even decorations at the Metro stations almost finished at the time of the ban (such as VDNKh and Alexeyevskaya) got their final decors simplified: VDNKh&#x27;s arcs/portals, for example, got plain green paint to contrast with well-detailed decorations and pannos around them.

A typical layout of the cheap shallow-dug metro station (which quickly became known as &quot;Sorokonozhka&quot; – &quot;centipede&quot;, from early designs with 40 concrete columns in two rows) was developed for all new stations, and the stations were built to look almost identical, differing from each other only in colours of the marble and ceramic tiles. Most stations were built with simpler, cheap technology; this resulted in utilitarian design being flawed in some ways. Some stations such as adjacent Rechnoi Vokzal and Vodny Stadion or sequiential Leninsky Prospect, Akadmicheskaya, Profsoyuznaya and Novye Cheryomushki would have a similar look due to the extensive use of same-sized white or off-white ceramic tiles with hard-to-feel differences.

Walls with cheap ceramic tiles were susceptible to train-related vibration: some tiles would eventually fall off and break. It was not always possible to replace the missing tiles with the ones of the exact color and tone, which eventually led to parts of the walls.

==== Metro stations of late USSR ====
The contrasting style gap between the powerfully decorated stations of Moscow&#x27;s center and the spartan-looking stations of the 1960s was eventually filled. In the mid-1970s the architectural extravagance was partially restored. However, the newer design of shallow &quot;centipede&quot; stations (now with 26 columns, more widely spaced) continued to dominate. For example, Kaluzhskaya &quot;centipede&quot; station from 1974 (adjacent to &quot;Novye Cheryomushki&quot; station) features non-flat tiles (with 3D effect utilized), and Medvedkovo from 1978 features complex decorations.

1971 station Kitay-Gorod (&quot;Ploshchad Nogina&quot; at the time) features cross-platform interchange (Line 6 and line 7). Although built without &quot;centipede&quot; design or cheap ceramic tiles, the station utilizes near-grayscale selection of colors. It is to note the &quot;southbound&quot; and &quot;northbound&quot; halls of the station have identical look.

Babushkinskaya station from 1978 is a no-column station (similar to Biblioteka Imeni Lenina from 1935). 1983 Chertanovskaya station has resemblance to Kropotkinskaya (from 1935). Some stations, such as the deep-dug Shabolovskaya (1980), have the near-tunnel walls decorated with metal sheets, not tiles. Tyoply Stan features a theme related to the name and the location of the station (&quot;Tyoply Stan&quot; used to literally mean &quot;warm area&quot;): its walls are covered in brick-colored ribbed panes, which look like radiators).

Downtown area got such stations as Borovitskaya (1986), with uncovered red bricks and gray, concrete-like colors accompanying a single gold-plated decorative pane known as &quot;Tree of peoples&#x27; of USSR&quot; or additional station hall for Tretyakovskaya to house cross-platform interchange system between line 6 and line 8. To this day, Tretyakovskaya metro station consists of two contrasting halls: brutalistic 1971 hall and custom design hall from 1986 reminiscent of Tretyakovskaya Galereya museum located within walking distance.

=== Post-USSR stations of the modern Russian Federation ===

Metro stations of the 1990s and 2000s vary in style, but some of the stations seem to have their own themes:
* Ulitsa Akademika Yangelya station used to feature thick orange neon lamp-like sodium lights instead of regular white lights.
* Park Pobedy, the deepest station of the Moscow Metro, was built in 2003; it features extensive use of dark orange polished granite.
* Slavyansky Bulvar station utilizes a plant-inspired theme (similar to &quot;bionic style&quot;).
* The sleek variant of aforementioned bionic style is somewhat represented in various Line 10 stations.
* Sretensky Bulvar station of line 10 is decorated with paintings of nearby memorials and locations.
* Strogino station has a theme of huge eye-shaped boundaries for lights; with &quot;eyes&quot; occupying the station&#x27;s ceiling.
* Troparyovo (2014) features trees made of polished metal. The trees hold the station&#x27;s diamond-shaped lights. The station, however, is noticeably dim-lit.
* Delovoy Tsentr (2016, MCC, overground station) has green tint.
* Lomonosovsky Prospekt (Line 8A) is decorated with various equations.
* Olkhovaya (2019) uses other plant-inspired themes (&quot;ольха&quot; noun means alder) with autumn/winter inspired colours.
* Kosino (2019) uses high-tech style with the addition of thin LED lights.

Some bleak, bland-looking &quot;centipedes&quot; like Akademicheskaya and Yugo-Zapadnaya have undergone renovations in the 21st century (new blue-striped white walls on Akademicheskaya, aqualine glassy, shiny walls on Yugo-Zapadnaya).

==== Moscow Central Circle urban railway (Line 14) ====
A new circle metro line in Moscow was relatively quickly made in the 2010s. The Moscow Central Circle line (Line 14) was opened for use in September 2016 by re-purposing and upgrading the Maloe ZheleznoDorozhnoe Kol&#x27;tso. A proposal to convert that freight line into a metropolitan railway with frequent passenger service was announced in 2012. The original tracks had been built in pre-revolutionary Moscow decades before the creation of Moscow Metro; the tracks remained in place in one piece as a non-electrified line until the 21st century. Yet the circle route was never abandoned or cut. New track (along the existing one) was laid and all-new stations were built between 2014 and 2016. MCC&#x27;s stations got such amenities as vending machines and free water closets.

Line 14 is operated by Russian Railways and uses full-sized trains (an idea, somewhat similar to S-Train). The extra resemblance to an S-Train line is, the 1908 line now connects modern northern residential districts to western and southern downtown area, with a station adjacent to Moscow International Business Center.

There is a noticeable relief of congestion, decrease in usage of formerly overcrowded Koltsevaya line since the introduction of MCC. To make line 14 attractive to frequent Koltsevaya line interchanges users, upgrades over regular comfort of Moscow Metro were made. Use of small laptops/portable video playing devices and food consumption from tupperwares and tubs was also improved for Line 14: the trains have small folding tables in the back of nearly every seat, while the seats are facing one direction like in planes or intercity buses - unlike side-against-side sofas typical for Metro.

Unlike MCD lines (D1, D2 etc.) MCC line accepts &quot;unified&quot; tickets and &quot;Troika&quot; cards just like Moscow Metro and buses of Moscow do. Free transfers are permitted between the MCC and the Moscow Metro if the trip before the transfer is less than 90 minutes. It&#x27;s made possible by using same &quot;Ediny&quot;, literally &quot;unified&quot; tickets instead of printing &quot;paper tickets&quot; used at railroads. 
* To interchange to line 14 for free, passenger must keep their freshly used ticket after entering Moscow Metro to apply it upon entering any line 14 station (and vice versa, keep their &quot;fresh&quot; ticket to enter underground Metro line after leaving Line 14 for an interchange).

=== MCD (D lines) ===

In 2019, new lines of Russian Railways got included in the map of Metro as &quot;line D1&quot; and &quot;line D2&quot;. Unlike Line 14, the MCD lines actually form S-Train lines, bypassing the &quot;vokzals&quot;, terminus stations of respective intercity railways. Line D3 is planned to be launched in August 2023, while D4 will be launched in September of that year. The schedule for the development of the infrastructure of the Central Transport Hub in 2023 was signed by the Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin and the head of Russian Railways Oleg Belozerov in December 2022.

As for the fees, MCD accepts Moscow&#x27;s &quot;Troika&quot; cards. Also, every MCD station has printers which print &quot;station X – station Y&quot; tickets on paper. Users of the D lines must keep their tickets until exiting their destination stations: their exit terminals require a valid &quot;... to station Y&quot; ticket&#x27;s barcode.

==== Big Circle Line (line 11) ====

After upgrading the railway from 1908 to a proper Metro line, the development of another circle route was re-launched, now adjusted for the pear-shaped circle route of line #14.

Throughout the late 2010s, Line 11 was extended from short, tiny Kakhovskaya line to a half-circle (from Kakhovskaya to Savyolovskaya). In early 2023, the circle was finished.
* Similarly made Shelepikha, Khoroshovskaya, CSKA and Petrovsky Park stations have lots of polished granite and shiny surfaces, in contrast to Soviet &quot;centipedes&quot;. Throughout 2018–2021, these stations were connected to line 8A.
* Narodnoye Opolcheniye (2021) features lots of straight edges and linear decorations (such as uninterrupted &quot;three stripes&quot; style of the ceiling lights and rectangular columns).

As for the spring of 2023, the whole circle route line is up and running, forming a circle stretching to the southern near-MKAD residential parts of the city (Prospekt Vernadskogo, Tekstilshchiki) as opposed to the MCC&#x27;s stretching towards the northern districts of Moscow. In other words, BCL &quot;mirrors&quot; MCC, avoiding forming a perfect circle around the city centre. While being long, the line is now the longest subway line in the world, ahead of the previous record holder - the line 10 of Beijing Subway.

==Expansions==


Since the turn of the 2nd millennium several projects have been completed, and more are underway. The first was the Annino-Butovo extension, which extended the Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya Line from Prazhskaya to Ulitsa Akademika Yangelya in 2000, Annino in 2001 and Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo in 2002. Its continuation, an elevated Butovskaya Line, was inaugurated in 2003. Vorobyovy Gory station, which initially opened in 1959 and was forced to close in 1983 after the concrete used to build the bridge was found to be defective, was rebuilt and reopened after many years in 2002. Another recent project included building a branch off the Filyovskaya Line to the Moscow International Business Center. This included Vystavochnaya (opened in 2005) and Mezhdunarodnaya (opened in 2006).

The Strogino–Mitino extension began with Park Pobedy in 2003. Its first stations (an expanded Kuntsevskaya and Strogino) opened in January 2008, and Slavyansky Bulvar followed in September. Myakinino, Volokolamskaya and Mitino opened in December 2009. Myakinino station was built by a state-private financial partnership, unique in Moscow Metro history. A new terminus, Pyatnitskoye Shosse, was completed in December 2012.

After many years of construction, the long-awaited Lyublinskaya Line extension was inaugurated with Trubnaya in August 2007 and Sretensky Bulvar in December of that year. In June 2010, it was extended northwards with the Dostoyevskaya and Maryina Roscha stations. In December 2011, the Lyublinskaya Line was expanded southwards by three stations and connected to the Zamoskvoretskaya Line, with the Alma-Atinskaya station opening on the latter in December 2012. The Kalininskaya Line was extended past the Moscow Ring Road in August 2012 with Novokosino station.

In 2011, works began on the Third Interchange Contour that is set to take the pressure off the Koltsevaya Line. Eventually the new line will attain a shape of the second ring with connections to all lines (except Koltsevaya and Butovskaya).

In 2013, the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line was extended after several delays to the south-eastern districts of Moscow outside the Ring Road with the opening of Zhulebino and Lermontovsky Prospekt stations. Originally scheduled for 2013, a new segment of the Kalininskaya Line between Park Pobedy and Delovoy Tsentr (separate from the main part) was opened in January 2014, while the underground extension of Butovskaya Line northwards to offer a transfer to the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line was completed in February. Spartak, a station on the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line that remained unfinished for forty years, was finally opened in August 2014. The first stage of the southern extension of the Sokolnicheskaya Line, the Troparyovo station, opened in December 2014.

===Current plans===

In addition to major metro expansion the Moscow Government and Russian Railways plans to upgrade more commuter railways to a metro-style service, similar to the MCC. New tracks and stations are planned to be built in order to achieve this.

==Stations==

Of the metro&#x27;s 250 stations, 88 are deep underground, 123 are shallow, 12 are surface-level and 5 are elevated.

The deep stations comprise 55 triple-vaulted pylon stations, 19 triple-vaulted column stations, and one single-vault station. The shallow stations comprise 79 spanned column stations (a large portion of them following the &quot;centipede&quot; design), 33 single-vaulted stations (Kharkov technology), and four single-spanned stations. In addition, there are 12 ground-level stations, four elevated stations, and one station (Vorobyovy Gory) on a bridge. Two stations have three tracks, and one has double halls. Seven of the stations have side platforms (only one of which is subterranean). In addition, there were two temporary stations within rail yards.

The stations being constructed under Stalin&#x27;s regime, in the style of socialist classicism, were meant as underground &quot;palaces of the people&quot;. Stations such as Komsomolskaya, Kiyevskaya or Mayakovskaya and others built after 1935 in the second phase of the evolution of the network are tourist landmarks: their photogenic architecture, large chandeliers and detailed decoration are unusual for an urban transport system of the twentieth century.

The stations opened in the 21st century are influenced by an international and more neutral style with improved technical quality.

==Rolling stock==

Since the beginning, platforms have been at least long to accommodate eight-car trains. The only exceptions are on the Filyovskaya Line: Vystavochnaya, Mezhdunarodnaya, Studencheskaya, Kutuzovskaya, Fili, Bagrationovskaya, Filyovsky Park and Pionerskaya, which only allows six-car trains (note that this list includes all ground-level stations on the line, except Kuntsevskaya, which allows normal length trains).

Trains on the Zamoskvoretskaya, Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya, Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya, Kalininskaya, Solntsevskaya, Bolshaya Koltsevaya, Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya, Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya and Nekrasovskaya lines have eight cars, on the Sokolnicheskaya line seven or eight cars, on the original Koltsevaya line seven cars, and on the Filyovskaya line six cars. The Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line also once ran seven-car 81-717 size trains, but now use five-car trains of another type. Butovskaya line uses three-car trains of another type.

Dimensions have varied subtly, but for the most cars fit into the ranges of long and wide with 4 doors per side. The 81-740/741 Rusich deviates greatly from this, with a 3-car Rusich being roughly 4 normal cars and a 5-car Rusich being 7 normal cars.

=== Trains no longer in operation ===
The V-type trains were formerly from Berlin U-Bahn C-class trains from 1945 to 1969, until its complete demise in 1970. They were transported from the Berlin U-Bahn during the Soviet occupation. A-type and B-type trains were custom-made since the opening.

=== Trains in operation ===
Currently, the Metro only operates 81-style trains.

Rolling stock on several lines was replaced with articulated 81-740/741 Rusich trains, which were originally designed for light rail subway lines. The Butovskaya Line was designed by different standards, and has shorter ( long) platforms. It employs articulated 81-740/741 trains, which consist of three cars (although the line can also use traditional four-car trains).

On the Moscow Monorail, Intamin P30 trains are used, consisting of six short cars. On the Moscow Central Circle, which is a route on the conventional railway line, ES2G Lastochka trains are used, consisting of five cars.

==Ticketing==

The Moscow Metro charges a flat fare for a single journey, regardless of distance or time travelled within the network. An exception to this is the Moscow Central Diameters, which operate on a zone-based fare system.
The Moscow Metro ticketing system allows free interchanges within a 90-minute window between different transport modes, including the MCC, the MCD, trams and buses.

Modern Metro turnstiles are designed to accept various forms of payment, including plastic cards like the Troika card or Moscow Resident Social Cards, bank cards, bank stickers, souvenir tickets such as Troika rings, bracelets, or keychains, and disposable RFID chip cardboard cards. Additionally, all stations are equipped to accept biometric payments. Some transport cards have usage limitations that impose a waiting period between consecutive uses (e.g., delays of 7 or 20 minutes).

=== History of the ticketing system ===
Soviet era turnstiles simply accepted N kopeck coins.

In the early years of Russian Federation (and with the start of a hyperinflation) plastic tokens were used. Disposable magnetic stripe cards were introduced in 1993 on a trial basis, and used as unlimited monthly tickets between 1996 and 1998. The sale of tokens ended on 1 January 1999, and they stopped being accepted in February 1999; from that time, magnetic cards were used as tickets with a fixed number of rides.

On 1 September 1998, the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in Europe to fully implement &quot;contactless&quot; smart cards, known as Transport Cards. Transport Cards were the card to have unlimited amount of trips for 30, 90 or 365 days, its active lifetime was projected as 3½ years. Defective cards were to be exchanged at no extra cost.

In August 2004, the city government launched the Moscow Resident Social Card program. Social Cards are free smart cards issued for the elderly and other groups of citizens officially registered as residents of Moscow or the Moscow region; they offer discounts in shops and pharmacies, and double as credit cards issued by the Bank of Moscow. Social Cards can be used for unlimited free access to the city&#x27;s public-transport system, including the Moscow Metro; while they do not feature the time delay, they include a photograph and are non-transferable.

Since 2006, several banks have issued credit cards which double as Ultralight cards and are accepted at turnstiles. The fare is passed to the bank and the payment is withdrawn from the owner&#x27;s bank account at the end of the calendar month, using a discount rate based on the number of trips that month (for up to 70 trips, the cost of each trip is prorated from current Ultralight rates; each additional trip costs 24.14 rubles). Partner banks include the Bank of Moscow, CitiBank, Rosbank, Alfa-Bank and Avangard Bank.

In January 2007, Moscow Metro began replacing limited magnetic cards with contactless disposable tickets based on NXP&#x27;s MIFARE Ultralight technology. Ultralight tickets are available for a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of magnetic cards ended on 16 January 2008 and magnetic cards ceased to be accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world&#x27;s first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contactless automatic fare-collection system.

=== Contemporary ticketing system ===
On 2 April 2013, the Moscow Department of Transport introduced the Troika smartcard, which serves as the foundation of the city&#x27;s modern ticketing system. Currently, passengers can use a single Troika card to pay for travel on the metro, MCC, MCD, buses, trams, river transport, suburban trains, and Aeroexpress. Approximately 80% of all trips in Moscow are paid for using Troika, with over 50 million cards sold to date.

In 2023, Troika production, including its chip, was fully localized in Moscow. In 2024, Moscow plans to launch a virtual analog of the card for smartphones.

Moreover, the Moscow Metro offers Ediniy (Unified) tickets with varying durations: 1 day, 3 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days and 365 days.

In 2015, the Moscow Metro started testing bank card payments at ticket windows. At the moment, bank card or bank sticker payments are accepted at all turnstiles in the network. As of April 2024, this payment option is used approximately 900 thousand times daily. 

In October 2021, the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in the world to implement biometric payment on a large scale. To use this system, passengers must link their photo, bank card, and metro card to the service through the Moscow Metro mobile app. This allows passengers to pay for their rides without taking out their phone, metro card, or bank card, thereby increasing passenger flow at station entrances. The technology is available at all metro stations, the MCC, and on river transport. As of April 2024, passengers have completed 100 million trips using biometric technology.

Other payment methods include:

* Payment via Mir Pay using an Android phone with a Mir card
* Payment with a smartphone via FPS in open test mode at all metro, MCC, and river transport turnstiles
* Cash or bank card payments at ticket offices and vending machines
* Moscow Resident Social Card

The Moscow Metro ticketing system received two prestigious international Transport Ticketing Awards in 2020 and 2021.

===Fares===

MCD network is divided between the &quot;Central&quot; and &quot;Suburban&quot; zone. Metro (with the monorail and the MCC) is completely within the Central zone.
== Passenger services ==
=== Passenger Mobility Center ===
The Passenger Mobility Center was created within the Moscow Metro in October 2013 to aid passengers with reduced mobility, encompassing individuals with hearing or visual impairments, mobility limitations, senior citizens, large families, and parents with strollers. Today, the PMC staff escorts passengers at the metro, MCC, MCD, buses and trams.

Since its inception, PMC has assisted over 1.15 million passengers with reduced mobility. In 2023, PMC staff escorted approximately 70,000 passengers, representing a 9% increase compared to 2022.

=== Wayfinding ===
In 2013, the Moscow Metro started to develop the new principles of wayfinding, including a redesigned metro map. Today, these principles have been applied to all of Moscow Transport. The new system is characterized by the following features:
* The single font of the Moscow Transport – Moscow Sans
* More concise and comprehensible signage
* Geographical maps across the city that includes information on surrounding streets and landmarks
* Use of easily understandable pictograms instead of words (e.g., line numbers)
* Assignment of numbers to each metro exit
* Floor signage on stations
* Accessibility information for passengers with reduced mobility
* Digital wayfinding screens above the doors in the newest train models
* A standardized design for temporary announcements

== Digital services ==
=== Mobile app ===
Launched in 2017, the Moscow Metro mobile app offers a range of useful features for passengers:
* Troika card management (purchase tickets, view pass and transaction history, set up auto-payment)
* Transfer of Troika card balance to a new card in case of loss
* Identification of less crowded carriages on arriving trains
* Temporary suspension of annual passes (once per year for 14 days)
* Route planning
* Linking of the Moscow Resident Social Card
* Purchase of intercity bus tickets
* Registration for biometric payment service
* Reporting of lost items
* Request for assistance from the Passenger Mobility Service
* Chatbot access
As of March 2024, the app has been downloaded 13 million times and is used by 2 million people monthly.

=== Chatbot ===
In 2020, the Moscow Metro introduced Aleksandra, a chatbot that has since become the official chatbot for all types of urban transport in Moscow. As of February 2024, Aleksandra has answered over 6.8 million questions and is equipped to respond to over 58,000 inquiries related to Moscow&#x27;s urban transport system.

== Notable incidents==

=== 1977 bombing ===

On 8 January 1977, a bomb was reported to have killed 7 and seriously injured 33. It went off in a crowded train between Izmaylovskaya and Pervomayskaya stations. Three Armenians were later arrested, charged and executed in connection with the incident.

=== 1981 station fires ===
In June 1981, seven bodies were seen being removed from the Oktyabrskaya station during a fire there. A fire was also reported at Prospekt Mira station about that time.

=== 1982 escalator accident ===

A fatal accident occurred on 17 February 1982 due to an escalator collapse at the Aviamotornaya station on the Kalininskaya Line. Eight people were killed and 30 injured due to a pileup caused by faulty emergency brakes.

=== 1996 murder ===
In 1996, an American-Russian businessman Paul Tatum was murdered at the Kiyevskaya Metro station. He was shot dead by a man carrying a concealed Kalashnikov gun.

=== 2000 bombings ===
On 8 August 2000, a strong blast in a Metro underpass at Pushkinskaya metro station in the center of Moscow claimed the lives of 12, with 150 injured. A homemade bomb equivalent to 800 grams of TNT had been left in a bag near a kiosk.

=== 2004 bombings ===

On 6 February 2004, an explosion wrecked a train between the Avtozavodskaya and Paveletskaya stations on the Zamoskvoretskaya Line, killing 41 and wounding over 100. Chechen terrorists were blamed. A later investigation concluded that a Karachay-Cherkessian resident had carried out a suicide bombing. The same group organized another attack on 31 August 2004, killing 10 and injuring more than 50 others.

=== 2005 Moscow blackout ===

On 25 May 2005, a citywide blackout halted operation on some lines. The following lines, however, continued operations: Sokolnicheskaya, Zamoskvoretskaya from Avtozavodskaya to Rechnoy Vokzal, Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya, Filyovskaya, Koltsevaya, Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya from Bitsevskiy Park to Oktyabrskaya-Radialnaya and from Prospekt Mira-Radialnaya to Medvedkovo, Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya, Kalininskaya, Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya from Serpukhovskaya to Altufyevo and Lyublinskaya from Chkalovskaya to Dubrovka. There was no service on the Kakhovskaya and Butovskaya lines. The blackout severely affected the Zamoskvoretskaya and Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya lines, where initially all service was disrupted because of trains halted in tunnels in the southern part of city (most affected by the blackout). Later, limited service resumed and passengers stranded in tunnels were evacuated. Some lines were only slightly impacted by the blackout, which mainly affected southern Moscow; the north, east and western parts of the city experienced little or no disruption.

=== 2006 billboard incident ===

On 19 March 2006, a construction pile from an unauthorized billboard installation was driven through a tunnel roof, hitting a train between the Sokol and Voikovskaya stations on the Zamoskvoretskaya Line. No injuries were reported.

=== 2010 bombing ===

On 29 March 2010, two bombs exploded on the Sokolnicheskaya Line, killing 40 and injuring 102 others. The first bomb went off at the Lubyanka station on the Sokolnicheskaya Line at 7:56, during the morning rush hour. At least 26 were killed in the first explosion, of which 14 were in the rail car where it took place. A second explosion occurred at the Park Kultury station at 8:38, roughly forty minutes after the first one. Fourteen people were killed in that blast. The Caucasus Emirate later claimed responsibility for the bombings.

=== 2014 pile incident ===
On 25 January 2014, at 15:37 a construction pile from a Moscow Central Circle construction site was driven through a tunnel roof between Avtozavodskaya and Kolomenskaya stations on the Zamoskvoretskaya Line. The train operator applied emergency brakes, and the train did not crash into the pile. Passengers were evacuated from the tunnel, with no injures reported. The normal line operation resumed the same day at 19:50.

=== 2014 derailment ===

On 15 July 2014, a train derailed between Park Pobedy and Slavyansky Bulvar on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line, killing 24 people and injuring dozens more.

==Metro-2==
Conspiracy theorists have claimed that a second and deeper metro system code-named &quot;D-6&quot;, designed for emergency evacuation of key city personnel in case of nuclear attack during the Cold War, exists under military jurisdiction. It is believed that it consists of a single track connecting the Kremlin, chief HQ (General Staff –&quot;Genshtab&quot;), Lubyanka (FSB Headquarters), the Ministry of Defense and several other secret installations. There are alleged to be entrances to the system from several civilian buildings, such as the Russian State Library, Moscow State University (MSU) and at least two stations of the regular Metro. It is speculated that these would allow for the evacuation of a small number of randomly chosen civilians, in addition to most of the elite military personnel. A suspected junction between the secret system and the regular Metro is supposedly behind the Sportivnaya station on the Sokolnicheskaya Line. The final section of this system was supposedly completed in 1997.

==In popular culture==
The Moscow Metro is the central location and namesake for the &quot;Metro&quot; series, where during a nuclear war, Moscow&#x27;s inhabitants are driven down into the Moscow Metro, which has been designed as a fallout shelter, with the various stations being turned into makeshift settlements.

In 2012, an art film was released about a catastrophe in the Moscow underground.

<text>Arkham House was an American publishing house specializing in weird fiction. It was founded in Sauk City, Wisconsin, in 1939 by August Derleth and Donald Wandrei to publish hardcover collections of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s best works, which had previously been published only in pulp magazines. The company&#x27;s name is derived from Lovecraft&#x27;s fictional New England city, Arkham, Massachusetts. Arkham House editions are noted for the quality of their printing and binding. The printer&#x27;s mark for Arkham House was designed by Frank Utpatel.

== Founding ==

In late 1937, after Lovecraft&#x27;s death, Derleth and Wandrei sought to produce a collection of their friend&#x27;s best weird fiction from the pulp magazines into a memorial volume. After several failed attempts to interest major publishers in the omnibus volume, the two men realized no publisher would be willing to take a chance with the collection. Derleth and Wandrei then decided to form their own company, Arkham House with the express purpose of publishing all of Lovecraft&#x27;s writings in hardcover. The omnibus volume was scheduled as the first offering from Arkham House and priced at $5.00, although advance orders were accepted at $3.50. Even at that bargain price, only 150 advance orders were received for &quot;The Outsider and Others&quot; before its release in 1939.

&quot;The Outsider&quot; was printed by the George Banta Co. of Wisconsin in an edition of 1,268 copies. The book was over 550 pages long with small print and featured a dustjacket by fantasy artist Virgil Finlay. The omnibus sold slowly but steadily. Derleth was a successful writer and had a good deal of revenue coming in from his writing work, which allowed him to subsidize Arkham House&#x27;s operations without it needing to realize a quick profit.

A second Lovecraft omnibus, &quot;Beyond the Wall of Sleep&quot;, appeared in 1943 as sales on all Arkham House books continued to advance. By 1944, Arkham House was established as a successful small press, with four titles appearing (collections of works by Donald Wandrei, Henry S. Whitehead, Clark Ashton Smith, and a final Lovecraft omnibus). In 1945, Arkham House widened its range by publishing two novels, neither of which had seen print in any form before. These were&quot; Witch House &quot;by Evangeline Walton and&quot; The Lurker at the Threshold &quot;by August Derleth (based on an outline by H. P. Lovecraft). Derleth also widened Arkham&#x27;s range by publishing collections of stories by well-known fantasy authors, the first being &quot;Green Tea and Other Ghost Stories &quot;by the Irish author J. Sheridan Le Fanu. Collections by Englishmen A.E. Coppard, H. Russell Wakefield, William Hope Hodgson and Algernon Blackwood followed in 1947. Also in 1947 were books by three American writers, including the science fiction novel &quot;Slan&quot; by A.E. Van Vogt. Derleth must have felt he was in the wrong field as &quot;Slan&quot;, with a print run of over 4,000 copies proved to be the fastest and best selling Arkham House of the 1940s.

Arkham House published many books in the fantasy and horror field including a small but steady number throughout the 1950s. Robert Weinberg has written that: &quot;However, intense competition from the SF (science fiction) small presses as well as slow sales of certain titles put August Derleth in a precarious bind. Only a generous loan from Dr David H. Keller prevented Arkham from going bankrupt during a period of cash flow problems in 1948. Keller visited Derleth&#x27;s home, &quot;The Place of Hawks&quot; in the company of Sam Moskowitz, the object of the visit being Derleth agreeing to publish a Keller book under the Arkham House imprint, Keller to advance Derleth a loan against the cost of the book. Derleth revealed to Keller and Moskowitz that he owed his printer $2500 and had exhausted every possible source of help. Upon Keller&#x27;s return to his home in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, he wrote a check for the needed sum and sent it to Derleth as a loan at 35% interest on Derleth&#x27;s personal note. Reporting the transaction in &quot;Thirty Years of Arkham House&quot;, Derleth adds: &quot;I had not asked for it; he had offered it with the comment, &#x27;I pride myself on my judgment of character.&#x27; No greater compliment could have been paid me or Arkham House.

In the late 1960s, Arkham House seemed again on the verge of going bankrupt, but suddenly found a whole new market for its books when the surge in interest in Robert E. Howard (capitalized upon by Donald M. Grant) coincided with a surge in interest in the work of H. P. Lovecraft. All of Lovecraft&#x27;s works were reprinted in three newly edited omnibus volumes, which were kept continually in print.

In addition to volumes of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s fiction, Arkham House began to publish a five volume edition of Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;Selected Letters&quot; which had been planned from the very start of the company, and which gives an overview of Lovecraft&#x27;s correspondence to peers, friends and family. Among his correspondents were Arkham House founders, Derleth and Wandrei. (Arkham House&#x27;s volumes of Lovecraft&#x27;s letters are highly abridged; unabridged volumes of Lovecraft&#x27;s letters to individual correspondents have been issued progressively by Hippocampus Press). After a long slow period, Arkham House entered the 1970s with ambitious publishing plans.

Arkham House also published fiction by many of Lovecraft&#x27;s contemporaries, including Ray Bradbury, Robert E. Howard, Frank Belknap Long, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert Bloch, and Derleth himself; classic genre fiction by authors such as William Hope Hodgson (under the prompting of Herman Charles Koenig), Algernon Blackwood, H. Russell Wakefield, Seabury Quinn, and Sheridan Le Fanu; and later writers in the Lovecraft school, such as Ramsey Campbell and Brian Lumley to whom Derleth gave their earliest publication in hardcover.

Despite the wealth of talented writers who appeared under the Arkham House imprint, it was not a financial success. Derleth wrote in 1970, &quot;[T]he fact is that in no single year since its founding have the earnings of Arkham House met the expenses, so that it has been necessary for my personal earnings to shore up Arkham House finances.&quot; Robert Weinberg has stated &quot;Arkham House&#x27;s greatest flop was &quot;Witch House&quot;, an excellent novel that took nearly two decades to go out of print.&quot;

After Derleth&#x27;s death in 1971 Donald Wandrei briefly acted as editorial director but declined to resume his interest in the firm permanently.

Prior to the 1980s Arkham House did not reprint its books (with some exceptions such as &quot;Someone in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Night&#x27;s Yawning Peal: A Ghostly Company&quot; and four of the core Lovecraft collections issued in the 1960s—&quot;Dagon and Other Macabre Tales&quot;, &quot;At the Mountains of Madness and Other Novels&quot;, &quot;The Horror in the Museum&quot; and &quot;The Dunwich Horror and Others&quot;). Rights were occasionally sold during the 1960s and 1970s to other publishers who issued paperback editions of Arkham House titles. However, this changed in the 1980s. There are now multiple printings and/or alternate editions of over 20 individual Arkham House titles.

== Operation ==

August Derleth&#x27;s children April (Rose) and Walden (Wally) Derleth now co-owned the publisher, April running the business while Wally had no direct involvement in its day-to-day operations. April earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1977. She became majority stockholder, President, and CEO of Arkham House in 1994, in which capacity she remained until her death.

Wandrei was succeeded as editorial director by James Turner. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Turner expanded the company&#x27;s range of authors to include such prominent science fiction and fantasy writers as Michael Bishop, Lucius Shepard, Bruce Sterling, James Tiptree, Jr., Michael Shea and J. G. Ballard, often publishing hardcover collections of shorter works. Turner&#x27;s acquisitions took the publisher away from its roots in weird and horror fiction, and he was eventually dismissed by April Derleth in 1997. He went on to found Golden Gryphon Press.

In 1997 Peter Ruber was appointed as her consulting editor and successor to James Turner. April became president of Arkham House in 2002. She made the house&#x27;s mission a return to classic weird fiction, which Ruber sought to do. Ruber drew criticism for the hostile opinions of various authors he expressed in his story introductions within &quot;Arkham&#x27;s Masters of Horror&quot; (2000). Rumors of his ill-health circulated for some time; he eventually suffered a stroke and his editorial duties at Arkham House lapsed due to this.

The house&#x27;s publishing schedule slowed considerably between 2000 and 2006, with only nine books issued—&quot;In the Stone House&quot; by Barry N. Malzberg (2000); &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; by E. Hoffmann Price (a collection of memoirs of writers known by Price, 2001); &quot;Arkham House&#x27;s Masters of Horror&quot; (ed. Peter Ruber, 2000); &quot;The Far Side of Nowhere&quot; by Nelson Bond (2002); &quot;The Cleansing&quot; by John D. Harvey (a horror novel, 2002); &quot;Selected Letters of Clark Ashton Smith&quot; (ed. Scott Connors, 2003); &quot;Cave of a Thousand Tales&quot; by Milt Thomas (a biography of pulp writer Hugh B. Cave, 2004); &quot;Other Worlds Than Ours&quot;, another collection by Nelson Bond (2005); and &quot;Evermore&quot; (a collection of tales in tribute to Edgar Allan Poe, ed. James Robert Smith &amp; Stephen Mark Rainey, 2006).

In 2005 Arkham House was awarded the World Fantasy Award for Small Press Achievements—the trophy at that time was a bust of H. P. Lovecraft.

In early 2009 it was announced that George Vanderburgh of Battered Silicon Dispatch Box, and Robert Weinberg, would jointly take over the editorial duties at Arkham House. That year Battered Silicon Dispatch Box issued four new volumes of stories by August Derleth under the umbrella title &quot;The Macabre Quarto&quot; under a joint imprint with Arkham House, which constituted the latter&#x27;s only output since 2006.

In 2010 &quot;The Arkham Sampler (1948–49)&quot; was reissued in a limited edition (250 sets) two-volume facsimile reprint of the now-rare magazine issued by Arkham House that ran four issues a year 1948–1949. This work was issued by Arkham House co-published with the August Derleth Society. In the same year Jon Lellenberg&#x27;s novel &quot;Baker Street Irregular&quot; was issued under the Mycroft and Moran imprint.

== Status ==

George Vanderburgh&#x27;s blog at Battered Silicon Dispatch Box announced a number of Arkham House titles for 2011 and after (the last being &quot;Evermore&quot;), none of which had appeared as of January 2017 due to April Derleth&#x27;s death on March 21, 2011. The publisher&#x27;s website announced in April 2011 that her children would take over the running of the firm. Danielle Jacobs was named president, and her brother Damon Derleth as vice president; they are also the current owners. George Vanderburgh would continue as house editor, as would Robert Weinberg until his death in September 2016.

No books have been issued under the Arkham House imprint in the 2020s; the press has reprinted some backlist titles. Books had previously been published almost every year from 1939 to 2010 (except for 1940, 1955/56, and 2006).

As of June 7, 2023, the Arkham House web site, arkhamhouse.com, has been down for several months. Arkham House has not made an announcement about the status of the company. It was stated on the August Derleth/Arkham House Facebook page that Arkham House is no longer in business, and they have not replied to several attempts at contact. As of March 2024, a pending new trademark application has been filed by Arkham House LLC of Minnesota with the USPTO office.

==Other imprints==
Arkham House published under two additional imprints during its history.

In 1945 the Mycroft &amp; Moran imprint was launched for the publication of weird detective and mystery stories, including Derleth&#x27;s Solar Pons series. The title of the imprint was inspired by characters from the Sherlock Holmes stories: Sherlock&#x27;s brother Mycroft Holmes, and the villain Colonel Sebastian Moran. Some Mycroft and Moran titles since 1993 have also been issued by Battered Silicon Dispatch Box.

Arkham also introduced Stanton &amp; Lee Publishers in 1945 with the intention of publishing cartoons by Clare Victor Dwiggins. Stanton &amp; Lee Publishers went on to publish poetry and the regional writings of August Derleth.

August Derleth also sub-contracted certain books which were nominally published by Arkham House to other publishers, including Pellegrini &amp; Cudahy of New York, and Villiers Publications of England.

<text>Socialist realism was the official cultural doctrine of the Soviet Union that mandated an idealized representation of life under socialism in literature and the visual arts. The doctrine was first proclaimed by the First Congress of Soviet Writers in 1934 as approved method for Soviet cultural production in all media. In the aftermath of World War II, socialist realism was adopted by the communist states that were politically aligned with the Soviet Union. The primary official objective of socialist realism was &quot;to depict reality in its revolutionary development&quot; although no formal guidelines concerning style or subject matter were provided.

It was usually characterized by unambiguous narratives or iconography relating to the Marxist–Leninist ideology, such as the emancipation of the proletariat. Despite its name, the figures in the style are very often highly idealized, especially in sculpture, where it often leans heavily on the conventions of classical sculpture. Although related, it should not be confused with social realism, a type of art that realistically depicts subjects of social concern and was popularized in the United States during the 1930s, or other forms of &quot;realism&quot; in the visual arts. Socialist realism was made with an extremely literal and obvious meaning, usually showing an idealized Soviet society. Socialist realism was usually devoid of complex artistic meaning or interpretation.

Socialist realism was the predominant form of approved art in the Soviet Union from its development in the early 1920s to its eventual fall from official status beginning in the late 1960s until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. While other countries have employed a prescribed canon of art, socialist realism in the Soviet Union persisted longer and was more restrictive than elsewhere in Europe.

== History ==

=== Development ===

Socialist realism was developed by many thousands of artists, across a diverse society, over several decades. Early examples of realism in Russian art include the work of the Peredvizhnikis and Ilya Yefimovich Repin. While these works do not have the same political connotation, they exhibit the techniques exercised by their successors. After the Bolsheviks took control of Russia on October 25, 1917, there was a marked shift in artistic styles. There had been a short period of artistic exploration in the time between the fall of the Tsar and the rise of the Bolsheviks.

Shortly after the Bolsheviks took control, Anatoly Lunacharsky was appointed as head of Narkompros, the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Enlightenment. This put Lunacharsky in the position of deciding the direction of art in the newly created Soviet state. Although Lunacharsky did not dictate a single aesthetic model for Soviet artists to follow, he developed a system of aesthetics based on the human body that would later help to influence socialist realism. He believed that &quot;the sight of a healthy body, intelligent face or friendly smile was essentially life-enhancing.&quot; He concluded that art had a direct effect on the human organism and under the right circumstances that effect could be positive. By depicting &quot;the perfect person&quot; (New Soviet man), Lunacharsky believed art could educate citizens on how to be the perfect Soviets.

==== Debate within Soviet art ====

There were two main groups debating the fate of Soviet art: futurists and traditionalists. Russian Futurists, many of whom had been creating abstract or leftist art before the Bolsheviks, believed communism required a complete rupture from the past and, therefore, so did Soviet art. Traditionalists believed in the importance of realistic representations of everyday life. Under Lenin&#x27;s rule and the New Economic Policy, there was a certain amount of private commercial enterprise, allowing both the futurists and the traditionalists to produce their art for individuals with capital. By 1928, the Soviet government had enough strength and authority to end private enterprises, thus ending support for fringe groups such as the futurists. At this point, although the term &quot;socialist realism&quot; was not being used, its defining characteristics became the norm.

According to the &quot;Great Russian Encyclopedia&quot;, the term was first used in press by chairman of the organizing committee of the Union of Soviet Writers, Ivan Gronsky in &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot; on May 23, 1932. The term was approved in meetings that included politicians of the highest level, including Joseph Stalin. Maxim Gorky, a proponent of literary socialist realism, published a famous article titled &quot;Socialist Realism&quot; in 1933. During the Congress of 1934, four guidelines were laid out for socialist realism. The work must be:
# Proletarian: art relevant to the workers and understandable to them.
# Typical: scenes of everyday life of the people.
# Realistic: in the representational sense.
# Partisan: supportive of the aims of the State and the Party.

=== Characteristics ===

The purpose of socialist realism was to limit popular culture to a specific, highly regulated faction of emotional expression that promoted Soviet ideals. The party was of the utmost importance and was always to be favorably featured. The key concepts that developed assured loyalty to the party were &quot;partiinost&#x27;&quot; (party-mindedness), &quot;ideinost&quot; (idea and ideological content), &quot;klassovost&quot; (class content), &quot;pravdivost&quot; (truthfulness). &quot;Ideinost&quot; was an important concept: not only was the work to embody an approved idea, but its content was more important than its form. This allowed the identification of formalism, a work in which the formal aspects of a work of art commanded more importance than the subject matter, or content.

There was a prevailing sense of optimism, as socialist realism&#x27;s function was to show the ideal Soviet society. Not only was the present glorified, but the future was also supposed to be depicted in an agreeable fashion. Because the present and the future were constantly idealized, socialist realism had a sense of forced optimism. Tragedy and negativity were not permitted, unless they were shown in a different time or place. This sentiment created what would later be dubbed &quot;revolutionary romanticism&quot;.

Revolutionary romanticism elevated the common worker, whether factory or agricultural, by presenting his life, work, and recreation as admirable. Its purpose was to show how much the standard of living had improved thanks to the revolution, as educational information, to teach Soviet citizens how they should be acting and to improve morale. The ultimate aim was to create what Lenin called &quot;an entirely new type of human being&quot;: The &quot;New Soviet Man&quot;. Art (especially posters and murals) was a way to instill party values on a massive scale. Stalin described the socialist realist artists as &quot;engineers of souls&quot;.

Common images used in socialist realism were flowers, sunlight, the body, youth, flight, industry, and new technology. These poetic images were used to show the utopianism of communism and the Soviet state. Art became more than an aesthetic pleasure; instead it served a very specific function. Soviet ideals placed functionality and work above all else; therefore, for art to be admired, it must serve a purpose. Georgi Plekhanov, a Marxist theoretician, states that art is useful if it serves society: &quot;There can be no doubt that art acquired a social significance only in so far as it depicts, evokes, or conveys &quot;actions, emotions and events that are of significance to society&quot;.&quot;

The themes depicted would feature the beauty of work, the achievements of the collective and the individual for the good of the whole. The artwork would often feature an easily discernible educational message.

The artist could not, however, portray life just as they saw it because anything that reflected poorly on Communism had to be omitted. People who could not be shown as either wholly good or wholly evil could not be used as characters. Art was filled with health and happiness: paintings showed busy industrial and agricultural scenes; sculptures depicted workers, sentries, and schoolchildren.

Creativity was not an important part of socialist realism. The styles used in creating art during this period were those that would produce the most realistic results. Painters would depict happy, muscular peasants and workers in factories and collective farms. During the Stalin period, they produced numerous heroic portraits of Stalin to serve his cult of personalityall in the most realistic fashion possible. The most important thing for a socialist realist artist was not artistic integrity but adherence to party doctrine, thus creating a singular utopian aesthetic.

=== Important groups ===

The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines socialist realism as &quot;a Marxist aesthetic theory calling for the didactic use of literature, art, and music to develop social consciousness in an evolving socialist state&quot;. Socialist realism compelled artists of all forms to create positive or uplifting reflections of socialist utopian life by utilizing any visual media, such as posters, movies, newspapers, theater and radio, beginning during the Communist Revolution of 1917 and escalating during the reign of Stalin until the early 1980s.

Vladimir Lenin, head of the Russian government 1917–1924, laid the foundation for this new wave of art, suggesting that art is for the people and the people should love and understand it, while uniting the masses. Artists Naum Gabo and Antoine Pevsner attempted to define the lines of art under Lenin by writing &quot;The Realist Manifesto&quot; in 1920, suggesting that artists should be given free rein to create as their muse desired. Lenin, however, had a different purpose for art: wanting it functional, and Stalin built on that belief that art should be agitation.

The term &quot;Socialist Realism&quot; was proclaimed in 1934 at the Soviet Writer&#x27;s congress, although it was left not precisely defined. This turned individual artists and their works into state-controlled propaganda.

After the death of Stalin in 1953, he was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev who allowed for less draconian state controls and openly condemned Stalin&#x27;s artistic demands in 1956 with his &quot;Secret Speech&quot;, and thus began a reversal in policy known as &quot;Khrushchev&#x27;s Thaw&quot;. He believed that artists should not be constrained and should be allowed to live by their creative talents. In 1964, Khrushchev was removed and replaced by Leonid Brezhnev, who reintroduced Stalin&#x27;s ideas and reversed the artistic decisions made by Khrushchev.

However, by the early 1980s, the Socialist Realist movement had begun to fade. Artists to date remark that the Russian Social Realist movement as the most oppressive and shunned period of Soviet Art.

==== Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia (AKhRR) ====
The Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia (AKhRR) was established in 1922 and was one of the most influential artist groups in the USSR. The AKhRR worked to truthfully document contemporary life in Russia by utilizing &quot;heroic realism&quot;. The term &quot;heroic realism&quot; was the beginning of the socialist realism archetype. AKhRR was sponsored by influential government officials such as Leon Trotsky and carried favor with the Red Army.

In 1928, the AKhRR was renamed to Association of Artists of the Revolution (AKhR) in order to include the rest of the Soviet states. At this point the group had begun participating in state promoted mass forms of art like murals, jointly-made paintings, advertisement production and textile design. The group was disbanded April 23, 1932 by the decree &quot;On the Reorganization of Literary and Artistic Organizations&quot; serving as the nucleus for the Stalinist USSR Union of Artists.

==== Studio of military artists named after M. B. Grekov ====

Studio of military artists was created in 1934.

==== The Union of Soviet Writers (USW) ====
The creation of Union of Soviet Writers was partially initiated by Maxim Gorky to unite the Soviet writers of different methods, such as the &quot;proletarian&quot; writers (such as Fyodor Panfyorov), praised by the Communist Party, and the &quot;poputchicks&quot; (such as Boris Pasternak and Andrei Bely). In August 1934, the union held its first congress where Gorky said:
One of the most famous authors during this time was Alexander Fadeyev. Fadeyev was a close personal friend of Stalin and called Stalin &quot;one of the greatest humanists the world has ever seen.&quot; His most famous works include &quot;The Rout&quot; and &quot;The Young Guard&quot;.

== Reception and impact ==
Stalin&#x27;s adversary, Leon Trotsky, was highly critical of this rigid approach towards the arts. He viewed cultural conformity as an expression of Stalinism in which &quot;the literary schools were strangled one after the other&quot; and the method of command extended across various areas from scientific agriculture to music. Overall, he regarded socialist realism to be an arbitrary construct of the Stalinist bureaucracy.

The impact of socialist realist art can still be seen decades after it ceased being the only state-supported style. Even before the end of the USSR in 1991, the government had been reducing its practices of censorship. After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev began to condemn the previous regime&#x27;s practice of excessive restrictions. This freedom allowed artists to begin experimenting with new techniques, but the shift was not immediate. It was not until the ultimate fall of Soviet rule that artists were no longer restricted by the deposed Communist Party. Many socialist realist tendencies prevailed until the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s. 

In the 1990s, many Russian artists used the characteristics of socialist realism in an ironic fashion. This was completely different from what existed only a couple of decades before. Once artists broke from the socialist realist mould, there was a significant power shift. Artists began including subjects that could not exist according to Soviet ideals. Now that the power over appearances was taken away from the government, artists achieved a level of authority that had not existed since the early 20th century. In the decade immediately after the fall of the USSR, artists represented socialist realism and the Soviet legacy as a traumatic event. By the next decade, there was a unique sense of detachment.

Western cultures often do not look at socialist realism positively. Democratic countries view the art produced during this period of repression as a lie. Non-Marxist art historians tend to view communism as a form of totalitarianism that smothers artistic expression and therefore retards the progress of culture. In recent years there has been a reclamation of the movement in Moscow with the addition of the Institute of Russian Realist Art (IRRA), a three-story museum dedicated to preserving 20th-century Russian realist paintings.

== Notable works and artists ==


=== Music ===
Hanns Eisler composed many workers&#x27; songs, marches, and ballads on current political topics such as &quot;Song of Solidarity&quot;, &quot;Song of the United Front&quot;, and &quot;Song of the Comintern&quot;. He was a founder of a new style of revolutionary song for the masses. He also composed works in larger forms such as &quot;Requiem for Lenin&quot;. Eisler&#x27;s most important works include the cantatas &quot;German Symphony&quot;, &quot;Serenade of the Age&quot; and &quot;Song of Peace&quot;. Eisler combines features of revolutionary songs with varied expression. His symphonic music is known for its complex and subtle orchestration.

Closely associated with the rise of the labor movement was the development of the revolutionary song, which was performed at demonstrations and meetings. Among the most famous of the revolutionary songs are &quot;The Internationale&quot; and &quot;Whirlwinds of Danger&quot;. Notable songs from Russia include &quot;Boldly, Comrades, in Step&quot;, &quot;Workers&#x27; Marseillaise&quot;, and &quot;Rage, Tyrants&quot;. Folk and revolutionary songs influenced the Soviet mass songs. The mass song was a leading genre in Soviet music, especially during the 1930s and the war. The mass song influenced other genres, including the art song, opera, and film music. The most popular mass songs include Dunaevsky&#x27;s &quot;Song of the Homeland&quot;, Isaakovsky&#x27;s &quot;Katiusha&quot;, Novikov&#x27;s &quot;Hymn of Democratic Youth of the World&quot;, and Aleksandrov&#x27;s &quot;Sacred War&quot;.

=== Film ===
Discussions of film as a tool of the Soviet state began in the early twentieth century. Leon Trotsky argued that cinema is a valuable means for propaganda and education and that it could be used to supplant the influence of the Orthodox Church in Russia.

In the early 1930s, Soviet filmmakers applied socialist realism in their work. Notable films include &quot;Chapaev&quot;, which shows the role of the people in the history-making process. The theme of revolutionary history was developed in films such as &quot;The Youth of Maxim&quot; by Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg, &quot;Shchors&quot; by Dovzhenko, and &quot;We are from Kronstadt&quot; by E. Dzigan. The shaping of the new man under socialism was a theme of films such as &quot;A Start Life&quot; by N. Ekk, &quot;Ivan&quot; by Dovzhenko, &quot;Valerii Chkalov&quot; by M. Kalatozov and the film version of &quot;Tanker &quot;Derbent&quot;&quot; (1941). Some films depicted the part of peoples of the Soviet Union against foreign invaders: &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; by Eisenstein, &quot;Minin and Pozharsky&quot; by Pudovkin, and &quot;Bogdan Khmelnitsky&quot; by Savchenko. Soviet politicians were the subjects in films such as Yutkevich&#x27;s trilogy of movies about Lenin.

Socialist realism was also applied to Hindi films of the 1940s and 1950s. These include Chetan Anand&#x27;s &quot;Neecha Nagar&quot; (1946), which won the Grand Prize at the 1st Cannes Film Festival, and Bimal Roy&#x27;s &quot;Two Acres of Land&quot; (1953), which won the International Prize at the 7th Cannes Film Festival.

=== Paintings ===
The painter Aleksandr Deineka provides a notable example for his expressionist and patriotic scenes of the Second World War, collective farms, and sports. Yuriy Ivanovich Pimenov, Boris Ioganson and Geli Korzev have also been described as &quot;unappreciated masters of twentieth-century realism&quot;. Another well-known practitioner was Fyodor Pavlovich Reshetnikov.

Socialist realist art found acceptance in the Baltic nations, inspiring many artists. One such artist was Czeslaw Znamierowski (23 May 1890 – 9 August 1977), a Soviet Lithuanian painter, known for his large panoramic landscapes and love of nature. Znamierowski combined these two passions to create very notable paintings in the Soviet Union, earning the prestigious title of Honorable Artist of LSSR in 1965. Born in Latvia, which formed part of the Russian Empire at the time, Znamierowski was of Polish descent and Lithuanian citizenship, a country where he lived for most of his life and died. He excelled in landscapes and social realism, and held many exhibitions. Znamierowski was also widely published in national newspapers, magazines and books. His more notable paintings include &quot;Before Rain&quot; (1930), &quot;Panorama of Vilnius City&quot; (1950), &quot;The Green Lake&quot; (1955), and &quot;In Klaipeda Fishing Port&quot; (1959). A large collection of his art is located in the Lithuanian Art Museum.

=== Literature ===
Martin Andersen Nexø developed socialist realism in his own way. His creative method featured a combination of publicistic passion, a critical view of capitalist society, and a steadfast striving to bring reality into accord with socialist ideals. The novel &quot;Pelle, the Conqueror&quot; is considered to be a classic of socialist realism. The novel &quot;Ditte, Daughter of Man&quot; had a working-class woman as its heroine. He battled against the enemies of socialism in the books &quot;Two Worlds&quot;, and &quot;Hands Off!&quot;.

Bruno Apitz&#x27;s novel &quot;Nackt unter Wölfen&quot;, a story that culminates in the vivid description of the self-liberation of the detainees, was deliberately chosen to take place on the same day as the formal opening of the Buchenwald Monument in September 1958.

The novels of Louis Aragon, such as &quot;The Real World&quot;, depict the working class as a rising force of the nation. He published two books of documentary prose, &quot;The Communist Man&quot;. In the collection of poems &quot;A Knife in the Heart Again&quot;, Aragon criticizes the penetration of American imperialism into Europe. The novel &quot;The Holy Week&quot; depicts the artist&#x27;s path toward the people against a broad social and historical background.

Maxim Gorky&#x27;s novel &quot;Mother&quot; (1906) is usually considered to have been the first socialist-realist novel. Gorky was also a major factor in the school&#x27;s rapid rise, and his pamphlet, &quot;On Socialist Realism&quot;, essentially lays out the needs of Soviet art. Other important works of literature include Fyodor Gladkov&#x27;s &quot;Cement&quot; (1925), Nikolai Ostrovsky&#x27;s &quot;How the Steel Was Tempered&quot; (1936) and Aleksey Tolstoy&#x27;s epic trilogy &quot;The Road to Calvary&quot; (1922–1941). Yury Krymov&#x27;s novel &quot;Tanker &quot;Derbent&quot;&quot; (1938) portrays Soviet merchant seafarers being transformed by the Stakhanovite movement.

&quot;Thol&quot;, a novel by D. Selvaraj in Tamil is a standing example of Marxist Realism in India. It won a literary award (Sahithya Akademi) for the year 2012.

=== Sculptures ===
Sculptor Fritz Cremer created a series of monuments commemorating the victims of the Nazi regime in the former concentration camps Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Mauthausen and Ravensbrück. His bronze monument in Buchenwald, depicting the liberation of this concentration camp by detainees in April 1945, is considered one of the most striking examples of socialist realism in GDR sculpture for its representation of communist liberation. Each figure in the monument, erected outside the campsite, has symbolic significance according to the orthodox communist interpretation of the event. Thus communists were portrayed as the driving force behind self-liberation, symbolized by a figure in the foreground sacrificing himself for his sufferers, followed by the central group of determined comrades through whose courage and fearlessness is encouraged. The German Democratic Republic used these sculptures to reaffirm its claim to the historical and political legacy of the anti-fascist struggle for freedom.
Claudia Cobizev was a Moldovan sculptor, whose work was known for its sensitive portrayals of women and children. Her most notable work is &quot;Cap de moldoveancă&quot; which was exhibited at the Paris International Exhibition to wide acclaim.

=== Theater ===
Theater is a realm in which socialist realism as a movement took root as a way to reach out and appeal to the masses. This occurred both within the Soviet bloc as well as outside of it, with China being another hotbed for socialist realism within theater.

==== Soviet Union ====

Countries within the Soviet Union were heavily influenced by socialist realism when it came to theater. Early after the 1917 revolution, a movement arose to attempt to redefine what theater was, with theorist Platon Kerzhentsev wanting to break down the barriers between actors and the public, creating unity between the two. This new way of thinking about what theater should be influenced the beginnings of socialist realism within this space, making it more communal and less hierarchical.

With the revolution, there was the ability to change the existing theatrical institutions to fit the new ideas circulating. The early 1920s saw this explosion of creativity, with organizations such as the TEO Narkompros (the Department of Fine Arts) working to incorporate new types of theater. Thus, these movements were later brought under control and solidified by the Soviet government, as individual theatrical troupes were organized and transformed through governmental support.

A part of these movements involved the reinvention of classic shows, including those in the Western canon. &quot;Hamlet&quot; particularly had a draw for Russians, and was seen to provide insight into the workings and complexities of Russian life after the 1917 revolution. Playwrights attempted to express their feelings about life around them while additionally following the guidelines of socialist realism, a way of reinventing old shows. &quot;Hamlet&quot; was re-imagined by Nikolay Akimov, for example, as a show that was more materialist in nature, coming at the end of this era of experimentation.

These movements were not merely localized to Russia, but spread throughout the USSR, with Poland being a notable location where socialist realism was implemented in theater. In order to make theater more accessible to the average person (for both entertainment and educational purposes), an emphasis was put on creating a network of smaller, independent theaters, including those in rural communities and traveling companies.

By making theater available to everyone, not simply those with the time and money to view it, officials hoped to educate the public both on theater itself and the various ideologies they wanted to promote. Beliefs that were more heavily promoted included those seen to be educational (with the idea of “teaching through entertaining” springing up), those upholding the values of nature and the countryside, and those that generally had a positive quality, especially when looking at children’s theater.

Reinvention of old forms took place, along with the creation of new theatrical movements. Opera as a theatrical form was reinterpreted and reinvented throughout the Soviet Union, moving away from its aristocratic roots and towards the support of the new state. By the 1930s, the Bolshoi Theater in particular became a symbol of Bolshevik power, and the question became how to best integrate socialist realism into an opera that could be performed there. The Union of Soviet Composers, established 1932, played a role towards creating these new operas, and spoke about the importance of socialist realism in opposition to modernistic art.

==== China ====
Though socialist realism was created by and is thought to mainly apply to countries within the Soviet Bloc, China in the late 18th century can be seen to be influenced by similar ideas, often taking direct inspiration from them.

Theater in China fell under the state’s purview after the Chinese Communist Revolution, led partly by poet and playwright Tian Han, President of the China Theater Association (among other honors). He pushed for theatrical reform in a socialist manner, primarily focused on transferring ownership from private troupes to state ones, but additionally on the subject matter of the plays themselves. This focus on private ownership as something to be avoided is similar to concerns seen in the Soviet Union, as is the nationalization of theater.

In the midst of these reforms, ideas around feminism and how it tied into socialism emerged, specifically with regards to theater. Bai Wei, inspired by Tian Han, developed a style of theater in the 1920s that focused specifically on women within a patriarchal society, and the struggle to break free of it. She additionally incorporated ideas of socialist realism within her work, though did break from it in some ways, including the fact that her characters were more individualized and less collective. Strong female characters were, however, idealized and put forward in Chinese socialist realism, with these women often shown making some sort of sacrifice or grand action in service of a greater cause.

Socialist realism in Chinese theater can be seen to hone in on the ideas that it is more valuable to take action as a group, together, than individually. This is evident from plays put on during the Cultural Revolution, where common themes included a large group standing up to imperialist forces (such as a Japanese invasion, for example), with the individual characters within the play being less important than the overarching power struggle occurring. By abstracting the conflicts to those occurring on a higher level, these plays hoped to educate and influence the people watching them.

== Soviet Union ==


In conjunction with the Socialist Classical style of architecture, socialist realism was the officially approved type of art in the Soviet Union for more than fifty years.

In the early years of the Soviet Union, Russian and Soviet artists embraced a wide variety of art forms under the auspices of Proletkult. Revolutionary politics and radical non-traditional art forms were seen as complementary. In art, Constructivism flourished. In poetry, the non-traditional and the avant-garde were often praised.

These styles of art were later rejected by members of the Communist Party who did not appreciate modern styles such as Impressionism and Cubism. Socialist realism was, to some extent, a reaction against the adoption of these &quot;decadent&quot; styles. It was thought by Lenin that the non-representative forms of art were not understood by the proletariat and could therefore not be used by the state for propaganda.

Alexander Bogdanov argued that the radical reformation of society to communist principles meant little if any bourgeois art would prove useful; some of his more radical followers advocated the destruction of libraries and museums. Lenin rejected this philosophy, deplored the rejection of the beautiful because it was old, and explicitly described art as needing to call on its heritage: &quot;Proletarian culture must be the logical development of the store of knowledge mankind has accumulated under the yoke of capitalist, landowner, and bureaucratic society.&quot;

Modern art styles appeared to refuse to draw upon this heritage, thus clashing with the long realist tradition in Russia and rendering the art scene complex. Even in Lenin&#x27;s time, a cultural bureaucracy began to restrain art to fit propaganda purposes. Leon Trotsky&#x27;s arguments that a &quot;proletarian literature&quot; was un-Marxist because the proletariat would lose its class characteristics in the transition to a classless society, however, did not prevail.

Socialist realism became state policy in 1934 when the First Congress of Soviet Writers met and Stalin&#x27;s representative Andrei Zhdanov gave a speech strongly endorsing it as &quot;the official style of Soviet culture&quot;. It was enforced ruthlessly in all spheres of artistic endeavour. Form and content were often limited, with erotic, religious, abstract, surrealist, and expressionist art being forbidden. Formal experiments, including internal dialogue, stream of consciousness, nonsense, free-form association, and cut-up were also disallowed. This was either because they were &quot;decadent&quot;, unintelligible to the proletariat, or counter-revolutionary.

Art exhibitions of 1935–1940 serve as counterpoint to claims that the artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called &quot;social order&quot;. A great number of landscapes, portraits, and genre paintings exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus ostensibly free from any ideology. Genre painting was also approached in a similar way.

Their time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas, and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by Vladimir Gorb, Boris Korneev, Engels Kozlov, Felix Lembersky, Oleg Lomakin, Samuil Nevelshtein, Victor Oreshnikov, Semion Rotnitsky, Lev Russov, and Leonid Steele; in landscapes by Nikolai Galakhov, Vasily Golubev, Dmitry Maevsky, Sergei Osipov, Vladimir Ovchinnikov, Alexander Semionov, Arseny Semionov, and Nikolai Timkov; and in genre paintings by Andrey Milnikov, Yevsey Moiseenko, Mikhail Natarevich, Yuri Neprintsev, Nikolai Pozdneev, Mikhail Trufanov, Yuri Tulin, Nina Veselova, and others.

In 1974, for instance, a show of unofficial art in a field near Moscow was broken up and the artwork destroyed with a water cannon and bulldozers (see Bulldozer Exhibition). Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s policies of glasnost and perestroika facilitated an explosion of interest in alternative art styles in the late 1980s, but socialist realism remained in limited force as the official state art style until as late as 1991. It was not until after the fall of the Soviet Union that artists were finally freed from state censorship.

== Other countries ==


After the Russian Revolution, socialist realism became an international literary movement. Socialist trends in literature were established in the 1920s in Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Writers who helped develop socialist realism in the West included Louis Aragon, Johannes Becher, and Pablo Neruda.

During the 1950s, this massive undertaking, a crucial role fell to architects perceived not as merely engineers creating streets and edifices, but rather as &quot;engineers of the human soul&quot; who, in addition to extending simple aesthetics into urban design, were to express grandiose ideas and arouse feelings of stability, persistence and political power.

In art, from the mid-1960s more relaxed and decorative styles became acceptable even in large public works in the Warsaw Pact bloc, the style mostly deriving from popular posters, illustrations and other works on paper, with discreet influence from their Western equivalents.

Today, arguably the only countries still focused on these aesthetic principles are North Korea, Laos, and to some extent Vietnam. Socialist realism had little mainstream impact in the non-Communist world, where it was widely seen as a totalitarian means of imposing state control on artists.

The former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was an important exception among the communist countries, because after the Tito–Stalin split in 1948, it abandoned socialist realism along with other elements previously imported from the Soviet system and allowed greater artistic freedom.

Socialist realism was the main art current in the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania. In 2017, three works by Albanian artists from the socialist era were exhibited at documenta 14.

=== China ===
Academics typically view China&#x27;s socialist literature as existing within the trend of Stalinist-influenced socialist realism, particularly major works such as Mikhail Sholokov&#x27;s &quot;Virgin Soil Upturned&quot; and Galina Nikolaeva&#x27;s &quot;Harvest&quot; which were widely translated and disseminated in China. Other academics, including Cai Xiang, Rebecca E. Karl, and Xueping Zhong, place greater weight on the influence of Mao Zedong&#x27;s 1942 lectures, &quot;Talks at the Yan&#x27;an Forum on Art and Literature.&quot;

=== East Germany ===

==== Overview ====
The earliest ideas of socialist realism in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) came about directly after the end of World War II, when the state was formed. While planning to establish a national East German culture, cultural leaders wanted to move away from fascist ideas, including those of Nazi and militaristic doctrines. Cultural leaders first started clarifying what &quot;realism&quot; entailed. The SED determined that realism was to act as a &quot;fundamental artistic approach that is attuned to contemporary social reality.&quot;

The characteristics of realism became more specified in East German cultural policy as the GDR defined its identity as a state. As the head of the SMAD&#x27;s cultural division, Aleksandr Dymshits asserted that the &quot;negation of reality&quot; and &quot;unbridled fantasy&quot; was a &quot;bourgeois and decadent attitude of the mind&quot; that rejects &quot;the truth of life.&quot;

Cultural officials looked back at historical events in Germany that could have acted as the origin points of the eventual creation of the GDR. The works and legacy of Albrecht Dürer became a point of reference for the early development of socialist realism in East Germany. Dürer created many artworks about the Great Peasants&#x27; War. His &quot;support for the &#x27;revolutionary forces&#x27;&quot; in his illustrations made him an appealing figure to East German officials, while they searched for a starting point of a new German socialist state. In Heinz Lüdecke and Susanne Heiland&#x27;s anthology &quot;Dürer und die Nachwelt,&quot; they described Dürer as being &quot;inseparably associated with the two great currents of bourgeois antifeudal progress, namely humanism and the Reformation...&quot; The authors also stated that Dürer came to mind &quot;both by bourgeois self-awareness and by the then awakening German national sense of identity.&quot; The legacies of Dürer and the Great Peasants&#x27; War continued as artists produced their works in the GDR. Thomas Müntzer was another key figure of historical interest and artistic inspiration for socialist realism in East Germany. Friedrich Engels revered Müntzer for arousing the peasantry to confront the feudal elite.

==== Visual Art ====
Socialist realist visual art in East Germany was unique in its various historical influences. It also stood out with how the art style transcended the boundaries of the art doctrine at times, yet still maintained the goals the state had of communicating early forms of German revolutionary history. Werner Tübke was one of East Germany&#x27;s most prominent painters, who demonstrated this expansive nature of socialist realist art in his country. Though his paintings did not always conform to the socialist realism doctrine, he was still &quot;able to portray the Socialist utopia, and in particular the understanding of history as held by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany...

Tübke&#x27;s style drew from the Renaissance art movement, as the GDR also emphasized this style in the creation of artwork, which they referred to as &quot;Erbe,&quot; or &quot;heritage&quot; art. He cited various Renaissance-era German painters whom he referenced in developing his art style in his &quot;Methodisches Handbuch,&quot; Dürer being one of them. He made several paintings depicting the lives of the working class and revolutionary struggle, in styles and compositions that resemble the historical German Renaissance paintings. His series of four triptychs called &quot;History of the German Working Class Movement&quot; was an example of this. Each painting was filled with action taking place on every part of the panel, along with several people in one scene, two common characteristics of German renaissance artwork.

The GDR aimed to use socialist realism to educate the German people about their history, through the lens of working-class struggle, and to evoke a sense of pride for their socialist state. The SED commissioned East German artists &quot;to produce paintings affirming the &#x27;victors of history.&#x27;&quot; Werner Tübke was tasked to create his Early Bourgeois Revolution in Germany. The state wanted to have a visual reminder of the German Peasants&#x27; War and the leadership of Müntzer in the revolt. The highly detailed mural includes many different scenes and key figures of the revolution. Dürer is included at the bottom of the painting at the fountain. Edith Brandt, the Secretary for Science, Education, and Culture, believed that the mural &quot;would enhance the historical awareness of the population, especially the young, and serve the cause of patriotic education.&quot;

East German socialist realism started to shift in later decades, especially after the Basic Treaty, 1972 was signed by both East and West Germany. The treaty allowed East German artists to travel to West Germany and beyond to other European countries. Artistic exchanges between artists in both states introduced these new practices to the GDR, while socialist realism gained more attention by those outside of East Germany. Two exhibitions featuring artwork from both East and West Germany were curated at the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1981. The exhibition for East German art presented itself as &quot;the good founded by socialist realism to better embody a possible alternative to the crisis of values experienced by the West.&quot;

==== Film ====
Film was used as a teaching tool for East German cultural values. DEFA was the GDR&#x27;s official film studio, which created such films. DEFA&#x27;s socialist realist films were especially geared towards East German youth, as the next generation of the GDR. Leader of the SMAD&#x27;s propaganda wing, Sergei Tiulpanov, asserted that the primary goal of DEFA was &quot;the struggle to re-educate the German people–especially the young–to a true understanding of genuine democracy and humanism.&quot; The studio produced children&#x27;s films to influence them, as they believed these types of films to be effective in emphasizing good citizenship and how to show children how to emulate this.

Gerhard Lamprecht&#x27;s Somewhere in Berlin (German: &quot;Irgendwo in Berlin&quot;) was one of DEFA&#x27;s most notable films. Though the film was produced in 1946, three years before the GDR was established, it was a foundation point for a broader development of East German socialist realist film. An antifascist film, Lamprecht emphasizes the necessity of &quot;reconstructing the nation&quot; after World War II. Preliminary East German films like &quot;Somewhere in Berlin&quot; &quot;laid the groundwork for a national film culture based in pedagogical intent.&quot;

Some DEFA films were also derived from earlier German fairytales that predated the GDR. Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;The Cold Heart&quot; (German: &quot;Das kalte Herz)&quot; was one of such films, which was based on the story written by Wilhelm Hauff of the same title. The film was produced to serve as a good example of how a person should treat others. The film&#x27;s main messages centered on the pitfalls of greed and the value of loving personal relationships.

DEFA also employed films to be used as history lessons for the people of East Germany, namely those about the German Peasants&#x27; War. Martin Hellberg&#x27;s Thomas Muentzer (film) told the stories of his leadership and the revolution in a heroic and idealistic portrayal. DEFA saw Hellberg&#x27;s film proposal as an opportunity to teach about German revolutionary history, as a means of preventing a descent into fascism again. The producers gave the actor portraying Müntzer lines that embrace Marxist thought, to clearly communicate ideals of socialism and the roles of the working class to viewers. Ideas about property re-distribution and a proletariat victory over the ruling classes are conveyed in the film&#x27;s depiction of the revolutionary leader.

==== Literature ====
Many of East Germany&#x27;s renowned writers lived through the Nazi regime, which influenced their craft and works with socialist realism.

Anna Seghers&#x27; 1949 novel The Dead Stay Young (German: &quot;Die Toten Bleiben Jung&quot;) was considered &quot;a foundational literary work for the young GDR.&quot; Critics commented on the pessimistic plot and message of the novel, as it was centered on the unsuccessful Spartacist uprising. Though the novel did not depict an ideal or optomistic view on socialism, critic Günther Cwojdrak stated that Seghers still communicated reality by fulfilling &quot;the task of transforming the working people and educating them in the spirit of socialism...&quot;

East German literature that followed Seghers&#x27; novel focused on including heroes as protagonists to communicate optimistic messages of the prospects of socialism. Journalist Heinrich Goeres suggested that writers should use Soviet literature as an example to write more positive stories. 

Early works of socialist literature in the GDR were produced in 1949 &quot;to promote the new socialist man.&quot; In later years, stories about women&#x27;s lives under socialism were written, and Christa Wolf and Brigitte Reimann were some of the authors who were involved in these widening developments.

In the 1960s, the SED introduced the &quot;Bitterfelder Weg,&quot; a part of Aufbauliteratur, which was a plan to send writers to industrial centers to generate &quot;cultural production&quot; between the writers and workers.

== Gender in socialist realism ==

=== USSR ===

==== Early Soviet period ====

In the poster propaganda produced during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922) men were overrepresented as workers, peasants, and combat heroes, and when women were shown, it was often either to symbolize an abstract concept (e.g., Mother Russia, &quot;freedom&quot;) or as nurses and victims. The symbolic women would be depicted as femininewearing long dresses, long hair, and bare breasts. The image of the urban proletariat, the group which brought the Bolsheviks to power was characterized by masculinity, physical strength, and dignity and were usually shown as blacksmiths.

In 1920, Soviet artists began to produce the first images of women proletarians. These women differed from the symbolic women from the 1910s in that they most closely resembled the aspects of the male workersdignity, masculinity, and even supernatural power in the case of blacksmiths. In many paintings in the 1920s, the men and women were almost indistinguishable in stature and clothing, but the women would often be depicted taking subservient roles to the men, such as being his assistant (&quot;rabotnitsa&quot;). These women blacksmith figures were less common, but significant, since it was the first time women were represented as proletarians. The introduction of women workers in propaganda coincided with a series of government policies which allowed for divorce, abortion, and more sexual freedom.

Peasant women were also rarely depicted in socialist propaganda art in the period before 1920. The typical image of a peasant was a bearded, sandal-shoed man in shoddy clothes and with a scythe, until 1920, when artists began to create peasant women, who were usually buxom, full-bodied, with a scarf tied around their head. The image of peasant women was not always positive; they often would evoke the derogatory caricature &quot;baba&quot;, which was used against peasant women and women in general.

As is discussed above, the art style during the early period of the Soviet Union (1917–1930) differed from the socialist realist art created during the Stalinist period. Artists were able to experiment more freely with the message of the revolution. Many Soviet artists during this period were part of the constructivist movement and used abstract forms for propaganda posters, while some chose to use a realist style. Women artists were significantly represented in the revolutionary avant garde movement, which began before 1917 and some of the most famous were Alexandra Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Liubov Popova, Varvara Stepanova, Olga Rozanova and Nadezhda Udaltsova. These women challenged some of the historical precedents of male dominance in art. Art historian Christina Kiaer has argued that the post-revolutionary shift away from market-based art production was beneficial to female artists&#x27; careers, especially before 1930, when the Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia (AKhRR) was still relatively egalitarian. Instead of an elite, individualistic group of disproportionately male &quot;geniuses&quot; produced by the market, artists shared creation of a common vision.

==== Stalin era ====
The style of socialist realism began to dominate the Soviet artistic community starting when Stalin rose to power in 1930, and the government took a more active role in regulating art creation. The AKhRR became more hierarchical and the association privileged realist style oil paintings, a field dominated by men, over posters and other mediums in which women had primarily worked. The task of Soviet artists was to create visualisations of the &quot;New Soviet Man&quot;the idealized icon of humanity living under socialism. This heroic figure encapsulated both men and women, per the Russian word &quot;chelovek&quot;, a masculine term meaning &quot;person&quot;. While the new Soviet person could be male or female, the figure of man was often used to represent gender neutrality.

Because the government had declared the &quot;woman question&quot; resolved in 1930, there was little explicit discourse about how women should be uniquely created in art. Discussions of gender difference and sexuality were generally taboo and viewed as a distraction from the duties people had to the creation of socialism. Accordingly, nudes of both men and women were rare, and some art critics have pointed out that Socialist Realist paintings escaped the problem of women&#x27;s sexual objectification commonly seen in capitalist forms of art production. But the declaration of women&#x27;s equality also made it difficult to talk about the gender inequality that did exist; Stalin&#x27;s government had simultaneously banned abortion and homosexuality, made divorce more difficult, and dismantled the women&#x27;s associations in government (Zhenotdels). The &quot;New Soviet Woman&quot; was often shown working in traditionally male jobs, such as aviation, engineering, tractor-driving, and politics. The point of this was to encourage women to join the workforce and show off the strides the USSR had made for women, especially in comparison with the United States. Indeed, women had expanded opportunities to take up traditionally male jobs in comparison to the US. In 1950, women made up 51.8% of the Soviet labor force, compared to just 28.3% in North America.

However, there were also many patriarchal depictions of women. Historian Susan Reid has argued that the cult of personality around male Soviet leaders created an entire atmosphere of patriarchy in Socialist Realist art, where both male and female workers often looked up to the &quot;father&quot; icon of Lenin and Stalin. Furthermore, the policies of the 1930s ended up forcing many women to be solely responsible for childcare, leaving them with the famous &quot;double burden&quot; of childcare and work duties. The government encouraged women to have children by creating portraits of the &quot;housewife-activist&quot;wives and mothers who supported their husbands and the socialist state by taking on unpaid housework and childcare.

Women were also more often shown as peasants than workers, which some scholars see as evidence of their perceived inferiority. Art depicting peasant women in the Stalin era was far more positive than in the 1920s, and often explicitly pushed back against the &quot;baba&quot; stereotype. However, the peasantry, still living in feudal society, was generally seen as backwards, and did not hold the same status as the heroic status as the revolutionary urban proletariat. An example of the gender distinction of male proletariat and female peasantry is Vera Muhkina&#x27;s statue &quot;Worker and Kolkhoz Woman&quot; (1937), where the worker is shown as male, while the collective farm worker is female.

<doc id="66492" wikidata="Q1321572" url="?curid=66492" title="Mi-Go">
<text>Mi-Go are a fictional race of extraterrestrials created by H. P. Lovecraft and used by others in the Cthulhu Mythos setting. The aliens are fungus-based lifeforms which are extremely varied due to their prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skill. The variants witnessed by the protagonist of &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; resemble winged human-sized crabs.

Mi-Go are first named as such in Lovecraft&#x27;s short story &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; (1931). However, since they are described in this story as &quot;fungi&quot; that come &quot;from Yuggoth,&quot; they can be considered an elaboration on earlier references to alien vegetation on dream-worlds in Lovecraft&#x27;s sonnet cycle &quot;Fungi from Yuggoth&quot; (1929–30).

==Description==
The Mi-Go are large, pinkish, fungoid, crustacean-like entities the size of a man; where a head would be, they have a &quot;convoluted ellipsoid&quot; composed of pyramided, fleshy rings and covered in antennae. They are about long, and their crustacean-like bodies bear numerous sets of paired appendages. They possess a pair of membranous bat-like wings which are used to fly through the &quot;aether&quot; of outer space. The wings do not function well on Earth. Several other races in Lovecraft&#x27;s Mythos also have wings like these.

In the original short story, the creatures cannot be recorded using ordinary photographic film, due to their bodies being formed from otherworldly matter.

They are capable of going into suspended animation until softened and reheated by the sun or some other source of heat.

The Mi-Go can transport humans from Earth to Pluto (and beyond) and back again by removing the subject&#x27;s living brain and placing it into a &quot;brain cylinder&quot;, which can be attached to external devices to allow it to see, hear, and speak.

In &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; the Mi-Go are heard to give praise to Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath, suggesting some form of worship. Their moral system is completely alien, making them seem highly malicious from a human perspective.

One of the moons of Yuggoth holds designs that are sacred to the Mi-Go; these are useful in various processes mentioned in the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;. It is said that transcriptions of these designs can be sensed by the Mi-Go, and those possessing them shall be hunted down by the few remaining on Earth.

The narrator of &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; learns that, ostensibly, a group known as the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign is dedicated to hunting down and exterminating the fungoid threat, though it is unknown if this is actually true since it was given as a pat explanation for the Mi-Go remaining hidden. The name &quot;Hastur&quot; is mentioned in passing among several other places and things, was eventually applied into a god-like alien being by August Derleth who gave Hastur the title &quot;Him Who is Not to be Named&quot;. However, in Lovecraft&#x27;s story, a human ally of the Mi-Go mentions &quot;Him Who Is Not to Be Named&quot; in the list of honored entities along with Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath, and &quot;Hastur&quot; in connection with the cult of the Yellow Sign opposing the Mi-Go&#x27;s work on Earth. Lovecraft never made a connection between Hastur and &quot;Him Who Is Not to Be Named&quot;, and indeed did not even imply Hastur was a being; Derleth was the one to do so.

<text>Telecommunications in Iraq include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet as well as the postal system.

==Radio and television==
The number of private radio and TV stations has increased rapidly since 2003. Iraqis get much of their news from TV. Radio listening has declined in tandem with the rise of TV. For private media, advertising revenues seldom produce a reliable income.

* Radio stations:
** government-owned radio stations are operated by the publicly funded Iraqi Public Broadcasting Service; private broadcast media are mostly linked to political, ethnic, or religious groups; transmissions of multiple international radio broadcasters are available (2007); 
** ~80 stations (2004). 
* Television stations:
** government-owned TV stations are operated by the publicly funded Iraqi Public Broadcasting Service; private broadcast media are mostly linked to political, ethnic, or religious groups; satellite TV is available to an estimated 70% of viewers and many of the broadcasters are based abroad (2007); 
** ~21 stations (2004). 
* Radios: ~4.6 million (1997). 
* Television sets: ~1.8 million television sets (1997). It has been reported that 88% of households in Iraq have television (2004).

During the reign of Saddam Hussein, broadcasting was largely the domain of the Iraqi Broadcasting and Television Establishment (IBTE). The IBTE, in turn, was dominated by the Ministry of Information. The IBTE often broadcast programming favorable toward Saddam Hussein, including music videos praising him and poetry readings when the station was down. Most IBTE transmitters were in the Baghdad area with a few regional stations. The IBTE aired former CBS reporter Dan Rather&#x27;s interview with Saddam Hussein, as well as the news from Baghdad Bob during the run up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. After the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, the IBTE was dissolved.

The current regulator is the Iraqi Communications and Media Commission, and the public broadcaster is the Iraqi Media Network, successor to the Coalition Provisional Authority&#x27;s and several other radio and television stations. The Iraqi Media Network currently operates the Radio of the Republic of Iraq and the government supported al-Iraqiya TV station. Many private TV stations are also available, such as the popular Al Sharqiya. Up to 97% of homes have a satellite dish and there are more than 30 Iraq-facing satellite networks. Iraqi radio stations showcase the diversity of popular opinion, from hard-line Islamic fundamentalism to Radio Sawa, politically oriented stations, and stations featuring content appealing to Kurdish listeners. In the northern autonomous Kurdish enclaves, rival political factions operate their own media.

The BBC World Service broadcasts in Iraq, as does the American Forces Network (AFN) and British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS). Other foreign radio stations operating within Iraq include the UAE&#x27;s Middle East Broadcasting Centre (MBC), Paris-based Monte Carlo Doualiya, Moyen-Orient, and Radio France International (RFI).

==Telephones==
* Calling code: +964
* International call prefix: 00
* Main lines:
** 1.9 million main lines in use, 62nd in the world (2012); 
** 833,000 lines in use (2005).
* Mobile cellular:
** 38.22 million (2019)
**26.8 million lines, 40th in the world (2012);
** 9.0 million lines (2005).
* Telephone system: Iraq War of 2003 severely disrupted telecommunications throughout Iraq including international connections; repairs to switches and lines destroyed during 2003 continue; widespread government efforts to rebuild domestic and international communications through fiber optic links are in progress; the mobile cellular market has expanded rapidly to some 27 million subscribers at the end of 2012; since 2007 three GSM operators since have expanded beyond their regional roots and offer near country-wide access to second-generation services; third-generation mobile services are not available nationwide; wireless local loop is available in some metropolitan areas and additional licenses have been issued with the hope of overcoming the lack of fixed-line infrastructure; local microwave radio relay connects border regions to Jordan, Kuwait, Syria, and Turkey; international terrestrial fiber-optic connections have been established with Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Kuwait, Jordan, and Iran (2011).
* Communications cables: links to the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG) / FALCON, and the Gulf Bridge International (GBI), and TGN-Gulf international submarine fiber-optic cables have been established (2011).
* Satellite earth stations: 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) and 1 Indian Ocean, 1 Intersputnik (Atlantic Ocean region), and 1 Arabsat (inoperative) (2011).

The 2003 Iraq War severely disrupted telecommunications throughout Iraq, including international connections. The Iraq Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO) under the U.S. State Department assisted the Iraqi Ministry of Communications by advising on the repair of switching capability and helping to devise the regulatory framework and licensing regimes for construction of mobile and satellite communications facilities. Many people and companies were involved in the reconstruction including private and public telecommunications companies from the United States, China, Turkey, and the Middle East. Special recognition must be given to the government of Japan and the World Bank Group for funding the first national microwave networks. Most credit goes to the staff of the Ministry of Communications and their operating personnel, and the numerous large and small service providers, who persevere under difficult working conditions. USAID funded several IT training programs with excellent international specialists as trainers and teachers.

Today the system has undergone a remarkable transformation with high rates of annual investment and a functioning regulatory system, that is not quite independent of the political process, but still provides the framework for a competitive telecommunications regime. In 2013-2014 the system is under stress from renewed fighting between different political factions in Iraq.

==Internet==

* Top-level domain: .iq
* Internet users: 
** 43 million users (2024)
**2.2 million users, 87th in the world; 7.1% of the population, 179th in the world (2012).
** 325,900 users, 126th in the world (2009).
* Fixed broadband: Unknown (2012).
* Wireless broadband: Unknown (2012).
* Internet hosts: 26 hosts, 218th in the world (2012).
* IPv4: 243,712 addresses allocated, 108th in the world, less than 0.05% of the world total, 7.8 addresses per 1000 people (2012).

Under the government of Saddam Hussein, Internet access was tightly controlled and very few people were thought to be online; in 2002 it was estimated that only 25,000 Iraqis used the Internet. With his ouster, Internet usage has become commonplace. Uruklink, originally the sole Iraqi Internet service provider, now faces competition from other ISPs, including broadband satellite Internet access services from both Middle East and European VSAT hubs. The primary military telecom service provider in Iraq is
Ts 2. Since 2006 several more companies have emerged to provide options to individual Iraqis that make Internet access more affordable, albeit with less bandwidth. One such business is Advanced Technology Systems-Iraq (ATS-Iraq).
===Internet censorship and surveillance===

In August 2009 the OpenNet Initiative found no evidence of Internet filtering in Iraq in all four of the areas for which they test (political, social, conflict/security, and Internet tools).

There are no overt government restrictions on access to the Internet or official acknowledgement that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without judicial oversight. NGOs report that the government could and was widely believed to monitor e‑mail, chat rooms, and social media sites through local Internet service providers.

The constitution broadly provides for the right of free expression, provided it does not violate public order and morality or express support for the banned Baath Party or for altering the country&#x27;s borders by violent means. In practice the main limitation on individual and media exercise of these rights is self-censorship due to real fear of reprisals by the government, political parties, ethnic and sectarian forces, terrorist and extremist groups, or criminal gangs. Libel and defamation are offenses under the penal law and the 1968 Publications Law with penalties of up to seven years&#x27; imprisonment for publicly insulting the government.

After the release and media amplification of the controversial &quot;Innocence of Muslims&quot; Internet video in September 2012, Christian groups reported an increase in death threats. One militant group called the Brigade of the Straight Path issued an ultimatum to Christians in Mosul to leave or be killed. The government provided additional security in Christian neighborhoods following the threat. There were no deaths or attacks related to the threat, and the government reduced security to normal levels by the end of 2012.

The constitution mandates that authorities may not enter or search homes except with a judicial order. The constitution also prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy. In practice security forces often entered homes without search warrants and took other measures interfering with privacy, family, and correspondence.

In 2011 when a documentary filmmaker and author of a prominent blog organized the video coverage of peaceful protests over the Internet via a short, nonsubscription messaging service, he was beaten on 22 April and again on 22 July, allegedly by individuals in civilian clothing linked to the security forces and by army officers as he attempted to videotape demonstrations in Tahrir Square for his blog. He went into hiding, and a few days after the second attack police searched his house. He later resumed blogging.

==Postal system==
As part of the post-invasion social and economic infrastructure reconstruction program, a contract worth $55 million was awarded to study the postal system in Iraq. The Postal system of Iraq was organized following that study.

<doc id="66495" wikidata="Q687559" url="?curid=66495" title="Final Fantasy III">
<text>is a 1990 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Family Computer. The third installment in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, it is the first numbered &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game to feature the job-change system. The story revolves around four orphaned youths drawn to a crystal of light. The crystal grants them some of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. Not knowing what to make of the crystal&#x27;s pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive families of their mission and set out to explore and bring back balance to the world.

The game was originally released in Japan on April 27, 1990. The original Famicom version sold 1.4 million copies in Japan. It had not been released outside Japan until a remake, also called &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;, was developed by Matrix Software for the Nintendo DS on August 24, 2006. At that time, it was the only &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game not previously released in North America or Europe. There had been earlier plans to remake the game for Bandai&#x27;s WonderSwan Color handheld, as had been done with the first, second, and fourth installments of the series, but the game faced several delays and was eventually canceled after the premature cancellation of the platform. The Nintendo DS version of the game was positively received, selling nearly 2 million copies worldwide.

It was also released for many other systems: the Japanese Famicom version via the Virtual Console on July 21, 2009 (Wii) and January 8, 2014 (Wii U), an iOS port of the Nintendo DS remake on March 24, 2011, an Android port on March 12, 2012, a PlayStation Portable port in late September 2012 (downloadable-only format outside Japan via PlayStation Network) and a Windows port via Steam in 2014. An updated release based on the Famicom version of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; was released as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster&quot; collection, marking the first time the original version of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; was released outside of Japan. This version was released in July 2021 for Windows, Android and iOS, in April 2023 for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, and in September 2024 for Xbox Series X/S.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; combines elements of the first two &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games with new features. The turn-based combat system remains in place from the first two games, but hit points are now shown above the target following attacks or healing actions, rather than captioned as in the previous two games. Auto-targeting for physical attacks after a friendly or enemy unit is killed is also featured for the first time. Unlike subsequent games in the series, magical attacks are not auto-targeted in the same fashion.

The experience point system featured in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; makes a return following its absence from the second game. The character class system featured in the first game also reappears, with some modifications. Whereas in the original game the player chooses each character&#x27;s class alignment at the start of the game and is then locked into that class for the duration of the game, &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; introduces the &quot;job system&quot; for which the series would later become famous. Jobs are presented as interchangeable classes: in the Famicom version of the game, all four characters begin as &quot;Onion Knights&quot;, with a variety of additional jobs becoming available as the game progresses. Any playable character has access to every currently available job and can change from job to job at will. Switching jobs consumes &quot;capacity points&quot; which are awarded to the entire party following every battle, much like gil. Different weapons, pieces of armor, and magic spells are utilized by each job. A character&#x27;s level of proficiency at a particular job increases the longer the character remains with that job. Higher job levels increase the battle statistics of the character and reduce the cost in capacity points to switch to that job.

&quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; is the first game in the series to feature special battle commands such as &quot;Steal&quot; or &quot;Jump&quot;, each of which is associated with a particular job (&quot;Steal&quot; is the Thief&#x27;s specialty, while &quot;Jump&quot; is the Dragoon&#x27;s forte). Certain jobs also feature innate, non-battle abilities, such as the Thief&#x27;s ability to open passages that would otherwise require a special key item. It is also the first game in the series to feature summoned creatures, which are called forth with the &quot;Summon&quot; skill.

==Plot==
===Setting===
One thousand years before the events in the game, on a floating continent hovering high above the surface of an unnamed planet, a technologically advanced civilization sought to harness the power of the four elemental crystals of light. They did not realize that they could not control such fundamental forces of nature. This power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental crystals. Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between light and dark, four warriors were granted the power of the dark crystals to recapture the power of the light crystals. These so-called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world. But their victory came too late to save the doomed civilization, whose culture was reduced to ruin, though their floating continent remained. On that continent, the circle of Gulgans, a race of blind soothsayers and fortune-tellers, predicted that these events will ultimately repeat.

===Characters===
&quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; focuses around four orphans from the remote village of Ur (while in the remakes players only begin as Luneth, slowly picking up the other three characters as they progress; a change from the original and from other early &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles), each starting off as an Onion Knight in the original game.

 is the antagonist the party seeks to stop for most of the game, though he is eventually revealed to merely be a pawn of the : a malevolent and vicious deity who wishes to push the world into a state of chaos and destruction by upsetting the equilibrium between light and darkness, allowing the Void to consume the world. Appearing in a female-like form, the Cloud of Darkness refers to herself in first-person plural because her two tentacles have minds of their own.

===Story===

An earthquake opens up a previously hidden cavern in Altar Cave near the village of Ur on the floating continent. Four young orphans, under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore the earthquake&#x27;s impact and come across a crystal of light. The crystal grants them a portion of its power and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. Not knowing what to make of the crystal&#x27;s pronouncements but recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive family of their mission and set out to explore an overworld outside the area where they were brought up to bring balance back to the world.

Their adventures led them to discover a whole world beyond the boundaries of the floating continent upon which they were living. In the world below, they discover a warlock named Xande, one of three apprentices to the legendary Archmage Noah, trying to possess the crystals of light to bring forth chaos. The four warriors eventually arrive at the Crystal Tower, discovering that the Cloud of Darkness is the source of the recent events. The Cloud attempts to create a similar situation to the Flood of Light a millennium earlier to pull the world into the Void. The Light Warriors traverse the domain of the dark crystals to free the imprisoned Dark Warriors and defeat the Cloud of Darkness, thereby restoring the crystals and bringing balance to the world. In the DS remake, several &quot;side quests&quot; can also be completed.

The story is virtually the same in the remakes but has significant differences in the introductory sequence. In the remakes, Luneth goes to the Altar Cave alone; while exploring, he trips and falls into a hole created by the earthquake. Goblins beset him, and while he is frantically searching for a way out, he comes upon a room where a Land Turtle ambushes him. After defeating it, he finds the Wind Crystal, which tells him that he has been chosen as a Warrior of Light, destined to restore balance to the world, and there are three others like him. Still, before Luneth can ask it to elaborate, he is teleported to the surface. He returns to Ur, but Elder Topapa does not elucidate much on the matter besides stating that someone had brought him to Topapa. Going to a corner of town, Luneth finds his friend Arc being bullied by some of the kids. When Luneth intervenes, the kids run away, with Arc running to Kazus, proving that he is not scared of ghosts.

Luneth chases Arc to Kazus and, upon reuniting with Arc, discovers that the rumors of a curse on Kazus are not false. The people there are see-through, and one such person, Cid of Canaan, instructs the two boys to take his airship and look for Refia, the Mythril Smith Takka&#x27;s adoptive daughter. They find her on the airship and accompany her to Castle Sasune as per her suggestion. There, they meet Ingus, a soldier of Sasune who had been away during the curses. He joins the trio after an audience with the king, who instructs them to find his daughter, Sara. They catch up to her in the Sealed Cave behind a wall that could only be accessible by interacting with &#x27;the skeleton key.&#x27; With her accompanying them, they battle the monster who cast the curse: the Djinn. Just as Sara seals the Djinn away, Luneth, Arc, Refia, and Ingus disappear before her eyes. As it transpires, the wind crystal summoned the four youths to grant them a portion of its power, which allows you access to the jobs Thief, Warrior, Black Mage, White Mage, and Red Mage. After this, Luneth and company reunite with Sara at Castle Sasune. She completely dispels Djinn&#x27;s curse by tossing the ring into a fountain of water underneath the castle but becomes depressed when Luneth reveals that he and his companions must leave at once. After Sara stops crying long enough to see them off, they return to Kazus, where Takka drags Refia home. The three boys consult with Cid and Takka, who build a Mythril ram on the ship. Refia is not with Takka when the boys return to ask for a Mythril ram, and when the party once more finds her aboard Cid&#x27;s airship, the player would be able to piece together why she wasn&#x27;t with him. She had told Takka that she was a Warrior of Light like the boys and, therefore, had to leave. The new introductory sequence ends with the airship being used to demolish the boulder in Nelv Valley along with the ship.

==Development==
Director and story writer Hironobu Sakaguchi, designer Hiromichi Tanaka, character designer Yoshitaka Amano, scenario writer Kenji Terada, and music composer Nobuo Uematsu returned from the two previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games to contribute to the development of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;. As with the previous two installments of the series, &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; was programmed for the Famicom by Nasir Gebelli. It was the last original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; title on which Gebelli worked. Midway through the development of the game, Gebelli was forced to return to Sacramento, California from Japan due to an expired work visa. The rest of the development staff followed him to Sacramento with necessary materials and equipment and finished production of the game there. The completed game was one of the largest ever released for the Famicom, published on a 512 KB cartridge, the second-highest capacity available for the console. Like many console role-playing games of the era, &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; is noted for its difficulty.

Square developed and released &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; during the same period that Nintendo released its 16-bit Super Famicom console, intended as the successor to the original 8-bit Famicom. Designer Hiromichi Tanaka said that the original game was never released outside Japan because Square was focused on developing for Nintendo&#x27;s new console:

Square planned to localize and release the game outside Japan; however, plans to localize the game were scrapped.

===Music===

The music of the &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; was composed by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu. &quot;Final Fantasy III Original Sound Version&quot;, a compilation album of almost all of the music in the game, was released by Square/NTT Publishing in 1991, and subsequently re-released by NTT Publishing in 1994 and 2004. A vocal arrangement album entitled &quot;Final Fantasy III Yūkyū no Kaze Densetsu&quot;, or literally &quot;Final Fantasy III Legend of the Eternal Wind&quot;, contains a selection of musical tracks from the game, performed by Nobuo Uematsu and Dido, a duo composed of Michiaki Kato and Sizzle Ohtaka. The album was released by Data M in 1990 and by Polystar in 1994.

Selected tracks the game were featured in various &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; arranged music compilation albums, including &quot;Final Fantasy: Pray&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy: Love Will Grow&quot; (with lyrical renditions performed by singer Risa Ohki), and the second and third albums from Uematsu&#x27;s progressive metal group, The Black Mages. Several tracks from the game were subsequently remixed and featured in later Square or Square Enix titles, including &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo&#x27;s Dungeon&quot;. Several pieces from the soundtrack remain popular today, and have been performed numerous times in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; orchestral concert series such as the &quot;Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy&quot; concert series and the &quot;Distant Worlds - Music from Final Fantasy&quot; series.

===Cancelled WonderSwan Color remake===
Bandai unveiled their WonderSwan Color handheld system in 2000 and had immediately headed up a deal with Square to release enhanced remakes of their first three &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles on the new console. Although &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; were both released within a year of the announcement, &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; was ultimately delayed from its late 2001 release date, even after Bandai picked up the game&#x27;s publishing rights. While a port of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was eventually released for the WonderSwan Color, Square remained silent regarding &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;. Although the game was never formally cancelled, the official website was taken offline once production of the WonderSwan Color consoles ceased in 2002.

In 2007, Hiromichi Tanaka explained in an interview that the WonderSwan Color remake had been abandoned because the size and structure of the coding of the original Famicom game was too difficult to recreate on the WonderSwan Color:

==Versions and re-releases==
There are two distinct &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; versions: the original 2D Famicom version, and a completely remade 3D version.

==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; (now &quot;Famitsu&quot;) gave the Famicom version a score of 36 out of 40, based on a panel of four reviewers giving it ratings of 9, 9, 10 and 8 out of 10. This made it one of their three highest-rated games of 1990, along with &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; and &quot;F-Zero&quot;, both of which scored 37 out of 40. It was also one of the magazine&#x27;s six highest-rated games up until 1990, along with &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; and &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;.

In &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot;″s 1990 Game of the Year awards, &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; was voted the runner-up for the Grand Prize, with 37,101 points, behind &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;. In 2006, readers of the Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; voted the original &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; the eighth best video game of all-time, above &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;. As of March 2003, the original Famicom game had shipped 1.4 million copies in Japan.

==Legacy==
From 1991 to 1992, Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s Famicom gaming magazine, published , a manga serialization of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; illustrated by Yu Kinutani. Based on the original story by Kenji Terada, the manga chronicles the events that take place throughout the course of the game. It was subsequently collected into three tankōbon under Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s Dragon Comics imprint: &quot;Legend of the Eternal Wind 1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot;.

The Onion Knight and the Cloud of Darkness are the respective hero and villainess representing &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; in &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;, where they are voiced by Jun Fukuyama and Masako Ikeda, respectively, in the Japanese version, and by Aaron Spann and Laura Bailey, respectively, in English. The characters reprise their roles in the sequels, &quot;Dissidia 012&quot; and &quot;Dissidia NT&quot;.

<text>The hippogriff (Italian: ) or hippogryph is a legendary creature with the front half of an eagle and the hind half of a horse.

It was invented at the beginning of the 16th century by Ludovico Ariosto in his &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;. Within the poem, the hippogriff is a steed born of a mare and a griffin—something considered impossible. It is extremely fast and is presented as being able to fly around the world and to the Moon. It is ridden by magicians and the wandering knight Ruggiero, who, from the creature&#x27;s back, frees the beautiful 
Angelica. Astolfo also borrows the hippogriff from Bradamante to go search for Roland&#x27;s wits.

The hippogriff became a subject of visual art in the 19th century, when it was often drawn by Gustave Doré.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;hippogriff&quot;, also spelled &quot;hippogryph&quot;, is derived from the , meaning &quot;horse&quot;, and the Italian &quot;grifo&quot; meaning &quot;griffin&quot; (from Latin: &quot;gryp&quot; or &quot;grypus&quot; from ), which denotes another mythical creature, with the head of an eagle and body of a lion, that is purported to be the father of the hippogriff. The word &quot;hippogriff&quot; was adopted into English shortly before 1615; prior to this, John Harington&#x27;s 1591 translation of &quot;Orlando furioso&quot; called the creature a &quot;Griffith horse.&quot;

The Hippogypians mentioned in &quot;Vera Historia&quot;, a fantastic travelogue written by the Roman author Lucian of Samosata in the Second Century A.D. suggest another likely source for the word. However, in that text, the term is used to refer to a race of moon-dwelling riders that employ gigantic three-headed vultures as steeds.

==Description==

Of the heraldic representations of the hippogriff, Arthur Charles Fox-Davies states that hybrid fantastical creatures&#x27; depictions are &quot;ugly, inartistic, and unnecessary. Their representation leaves one with a disappointed feeling of crudity of draughtsmanship.&quot; John Vinycomb states that the hippogriff is not used in the British heraldic tradition.
Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s poem, &quot;Orlando furioso&quot; (1516) contains the following description (canto IV):

According to Thomas Bulfinch&#x27;s &quot;Legends of Charlemagne&quot;:
==Beliefs and symbolism==
According to Vidal, a Spanish historian, this creature was supposed to live near Céret, in the County of Roussillon of modern-day France, during the Middle Ages. Claw marks were found on a rock near Mas Carol. The belief in the existence of the hippogriff, such as Ariosto describes, is fiercely attacked in a scientific essay on religion in 1862, which argues that such an animal can neither be a divine creation, nor truly exist. The Book of Enoch quite clearly details how Satan and his fallen angels created various hybrids by admixture. The Sphinx is the best known such hybrid. The hippogriff is supposed to be a mixture of several animals and the author notes that in order to support its weight, the wings would be so heavy that flight would be impossible, which proves—without question—that it does not exist.

In some traditions, the hippogriff is said to be the symbol of love, as its parents, the mare and griffin, are natural enemies. In other traditions, the hippogriff represents Christ&#x27;s dual nature as both human and divine.

==Modern representations==
* Artist Max Klinger used the hippogriff amongst other objects in his drawing &quot;Fantasy and the Artist&quot; to note his disparagement for artistic work that relies on out-worn and clichéd symbolism.
* In a hoax initially perpetrated in 1904 in Lake George, New York State, tricksters used a fake &quot;monster&quot; which became known as &quot;The Hippogriff&quot;. The creation had a head of a bird of prey, teeth, and two large horse ears, which could be controlled from below. The pranks and sightings faded until 1999 when several people staying at the Island Harbour House Hotel stated they had seen a sea monster at night. The old hoax was uncovered by the &quot;Daily News&quot; and the Lake George Historical Association Museum, which created a copy of the original wooden monster to display to the public in August 2002.
* The hippogriff appears in various works of fantasy, such as works of E. Nesbit and E. R. Eddison&#x27;s &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; (1922). It&#x27;s also regularly alluded to as a fearsome monster by Bertie Wooster in P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s Jeeves stories.
* The fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; includes a version of the creature, which is described as having a horse&#x27;s &quot;ears, neck, mane, torso, and hind legs&quot; and an eagle&#x27;s &quot;wings, forelegs, and face&quot;. According to the game&#x27;s rules, the creatures are closely related to griffins and pegasi. Hippogriffs, pegasi, and horses are all hunted by griffins as the latter have a strong attraction to the flesh of horses. An artistic representation of the hippogriff drawing inspiration from real eagles and horses was used for the cover of the third booklet of the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (1974) edition.
* As with many ancient mythical beasts, a hippogriff named Buckbeak (subsequently &quot;Witherwings&quot;) features prominently in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. Peter Dendle says that the portrayal of the treatment of Buckbeak in the novels is one example that demonstrates &quot;[t]he emotional need to express domination symbolically&quot; as well as being one of the episodes that allows Harry to be shown as the &quot;perennial liberator of all manner of creatures.&quot; Al Roker calls the creation of Buckbeak in the film &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; &quot;one of the most magnificent and realistic creatures in film history.&quot; The character was used to create the theme for a roller coaster called Flight of the Hippogriff at the Florida amusement park The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in which the cars are wicker covered and pass by a statue of a hippogriff in a nest. Stefano Jossa has reconstructed the web of relations of Rowling&#x27;s hippogriff.
* In the &quot;Digimon&quot; franchise, there is a Digimon called Hippogriffomon.
* Hippogriffs appeared in the 2017 film &quot;My Little Pony: The Movie&quot;, where they were transformed into seaponies. They were also featured in the season 8 premiere of the show, with the reoccurring character being Silverstream.
* In the anime &quot;Fate/Apocrypha&quot;, the Servant Astolfo, also known as Rider of Black, is able to summon a hippogriff that they use a mount with their Noble Phantasm Hippogriff. The hippogriff is considered to be a Phantasmal Species.
* Hippogriffs are ridden by the Knights of Bretonnia from the tabletop game &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot;, and also appear in the video game adaptation &quot;Total War: Warhammer&quot;.
* In the 11th book of the &quot;Fighting Fantasy &quot;gamebook series,&quot;Talisman of Death&quot;, the adventurer enjoys a plate of hippogriff in creamy sauce in one of Greyguilds-on-the-moor&#x27;s many inns.

<doc id="66499" wikidata="Q944235" url="?curid=66499" title="Informal economy">
<text>An informal economy (informal sector or grey economy) is the part of any economy that is neither taxed nor monitored by any form of government. Although the informal sector makes up a significant portion of the economies in developing countries, it is sometimes stigmatized as troublesome and unmanageable. However, the informal sector provides critical economic opportunities for the poor and has been expanding rapidly since the 1960s. Integrating the informal economy into the formal sector is an important policy challenge.

In many cases, unlike the formal economy, activities of the informal economy are not included in a country&#x27;s gross national product (GNP) or gross domestic product (GDP). However, Italy has included estimates of informal activity in their GDP calculations since 1987, which swells their GDP by an estimated 18% and in 2014, a number of European countries formally changed their GDP calculations to include prostitution and narcotics sales in their official GDP statistics, in line with international accounting standards, prompting an increase between 3-7%. The informal sector can be described as a grey market in labour. Other concepts that can be characterized as informal sector can include the black market (shadow economy, underground economy), agorism, and System D. Associated idioms include &quot;under the table&quot;, &quot;off the books&quot;, and &quot;working for cash&quot;.

==Definition==

The original use of the term &#x27;informal sector&#x27; is attributed to the economic development model put forward in 1955 by W. Arthur Lewis, used to describe employment or livelihood generation primarily within the developing world. It was used to describe a type of employment that was viewed as falling outside of the modern industrial sector. 
An alternative definition from 2007 uses job security as the measure of formality, defining participants in the informal economy as those &quot;who do not have employment security, work security and social security&quot;. While both of these definitions imply a lack of choice or agency in involvement with the informal economy, participation may also be driven by a wish to avoid regulation or taxation. This may manifest as unreported employment, hidden from the state for tax, social security or labour law purposes, but legal in all other aspects.
In 2016 Edgar L. Feige proposed a taxonomy for describing unobserved economies including the informal economy as being characterized by some form of &quot;non-compliant behavior with an institutional set of rules&quot;. He argues that circumvention of labor market regulations specifying minimum wages, working conditions, social security, unemployment and disability benefits gives rise to an informal economy, which deprives some workers of deserved benefits while conveying undeserved benefits to others.

The term is also useful in describing and accounting for forms of shelter or living arrangements that are similarly unlawful, unregulated, or not afforded protection of the state. &#x27;Informal economy&#x27; is increasingly replacing &#x27;informal sector&#x27; as the preferred descriptor for this activity.

Informality, both in housing and livelihood generation has historically been seen as a social ill, and described either in terms of what participant&#x27;s lack, or wish to avoid. In 2009, the Dutch sociologist Saskia Sassen viewed the new &#x27;informal&#x27; sector as the product and driver of advanced capitalism and the site of the most entrepreneurial aspects of the urban economy, led by creative professionals such as artists, architects, designers and software developers. While this manifestation of the informal sector remains largely a feature of developed countries, increasingly systems are emerging to facilitate similarly qualified people in developing countries to participate.

==History==
Governments have tried to regulate aspects of their economies for as long as surplus wealth has existed which is at least as early as Sumer. Yet no such regulation has ever been wholly enforceable.
Archaeological and anthropological evidence strongly suggests that people of all societies regularly adjust their activity within economic systems in attempt to evade regulations. Therefore, if informal economic activity is that which goes unregulated in an otherwise regulated system then informal economies are as old as their formal counterparts, if not older. The term itself, however, is much more recent.

The optimism of the modernization theory school of development had led people in the 1950s and 1960s to believe that traditional forms of work and production would disappear as a result of economic progress in developing countries. As this optimism proved to be unfounded, scholars turned to study more closely what was then called the traditional sector and found that the sector had not only persisted, but in fact expanded to encompass new developments. In accepting that these forms of productions were there to stay, scholars and some international organizations quickly took up the term informal sector (later known as the informal economy or just informality). The term Informal income opportunities is credited to the British anthropologist Keith Hart in a 1971 study on Ghana published in 1973, and was coined by the International Labour Organization in a widely read study on Kenya in 1972.

In his 1989 book &quot;The Underground Economies: Tax Evasion and Information Distortion&quot;, Edgar L. Feige examined the economic implications of a shift of economic activity from the observed to the non-observed sector of the economy. Such a shift not only reduces the government&#x27;s ability to collect revenues, it can also bias the nation&#x27;s information systems and therefore lead to misguided policy decisions. The book examines alternative means of estimating the size of various unobserved economies and examines their consequences in both socialist and market oriented economies. Feige goes on to develop a taxonomic framework that clarifies the distinctions between informal, illegal, unreported and unrecorded economies, and identifies their conceptual and empirical linkages and the alternative means of measuring their size and trends.
Since then, the informal sector has become an increasingly popular subject of investigation in economics, sociology, anthropology and urban planning. With the turn towards so called post-fordist modes of production in the advanced developing countries, many workers were forced out of their formal sector work and into informal employment. In a 2005 collection of articles, &quot;The Informal Economy. Studies in Advanced and Less Developed Countries&quot;, the existence of an informal economy in all countries was demonstrated with case studies ranging from New York City and Madrid to Uruguay and Colombia.
An influential book on the informal economy is Hernando de Soto&#x27;s &quot;El otro sendero&quot; (1986), which was published in English in 1989 as &quot;The Other Path&quot; with a preface by Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa. De Soto and his team argued that excessive regulation in the Peruvian and other Latin American economies forced a large part of the economy into informality and thus prevented economic development. While accusing the ruling class of 20th century mercantilism, de Soto admired the entrepreneurial spirit of the informal economy. In a widely cited experiment, his team tried to legally register a small garment factory in Lima. This took more than 100 administrative steps and almost a year of full-time work. Feige&#x27;s review of the Other Path places the work in the context of the informal economy literature. Whereas de Soto&#x27;s work is popular with policymakers and champions of free market policies like &quot;The Economist&quot;, some scholars of the informal economy have criticized it both for methodological flaws and normative bias.

In the second half of the 1990s many scholars started to consciously use the term &quot;informal economy&quot; instead of &quot;informal sector&quot; to refer to a broader concept which includes enterprises as well as employment in developing, transition, and advanced industrialized economies.

Among the surveys about the size and development of the shadow economy (mostly expressed in percent of official GDP) are those by Feige (1989), and Schneider and Enste (2000) with an intensive discussion about the various estimation procedures of the size of the shadow economy as well as a critical evaluation of the size of the shadow economy and the consequences of the shadow economy on the official one. Feige&#x27;s most recent survey paper on the subject from 2016 reviewed the meaning and measurement of unobserved economies and is particularly critical of estimates of the size of the so-called shadow economy which employ Multiple Indicator multiple cause methods, which treat the shadow economy as a latent variable.

==Characteristics==

The informal sector is largely characterized by several qualities: skills gained outside of a formal education, easy entry (meaning anyone who wishes to join the sector can find some sort of work which will result in cash earnings), a lack of stable employer-employee relationships, and a small scale of operations. Workers who participate in the informal economy are typically classified as employed. The type of work that makes up the informal economy is diverse, particularly in terms of capital invested, technology used, and income generated.

The spectrum ranges from self-employment or unpaid family labor to street vendors, shoe shiners, and junk collectors. On the higher end of the spectrum are upper-tier informal activities such as small-scale service or manufacturing businesses, which have more limited entry. The upper-tier informal activities have higher set-up costs, which might include complicated licensing regulations, and irregular hours of operation. However, most workers in the informal sector, even those are self-employed or wage workers, do not have access to secure work, benefits, welfare protection, or representation.
These features differ from businesses and employees in the formal sector which have regular hours of operation, a regular location and other structured benefits.

According to a 2018 study on informality in Brazil, there are three views to explain the causes of informality. The first view argues that the informal sector is a reservoir of potentially productive entrepreneurs who are kept out of formality by high regulatory costs, most notably entry regulation. The second sees informal forms as &quot;parasitic forms&quot; which are productive enough to survive in the formal sector but choose to remain informal to earn higher profits from the cost advantages of not complying with taxes and regulations. The third argues that informality is a survival strategy for low-skill individuals, who are too unproductive to ever become formal. According to the study the first view corresponds to 9.3 percent of all informal forms, while the second corresponds to 41.9 percent. The remaining forms correspond to low-skill entrepreneurs who are too unproductive to ever become formal. The author suggests that informal forms are to a large extent &quot;parasitic&quot; and therefore eradicating them (e.g., through tighter enforcement) could produce positive effects on the economy.
The most prevalent types of work in the informal economy are home-based workers and street vendors. Home-based workers are more numerous while street vendors are more visible. Combined, the two fields make up about 10–15% of the non-agricultural workforce in developing countries and over 5% of the workforce in developed countries.

While participation in the informal sector can be stigmatized, many workers engage in informal ventures by choice, for either economic or non-economic reasons. Economic motivations include the ability to evade taxes, the freedom to circumvent regulations and licensing requirements, and the capacity to maintain certain government benefits. A study of informal workers in Costa Rica illustrated other economic reasons for staying in the informal sector, as well as non-economic factors. First, they felt they would earn more money through their informal sector work than at a job in the formal economy. Second, even if workers made less money, working in the informal sector offered them more independence, the chance to select their own hours, the opportunity to work outside and near friends, etc. While jobs in the formal economy might bring more security and regularity, or even pay better, the combination of monetary and psychological rewards from working in the informal sector proves appealing for many workers.

The informal sector was historically recognized as an opposition to formal economy, meaning it included all income earning activities beyond legally regulated enterprises. However, this understanding is too inclusive and vague, and certain activities that could be included by that definition are not considered part of the informal economy. As the International Labour Organization defined the informal sector in 2002, the informal sector does not include the criminal economy. While production or employment arrangements in the informal economy may not be strictly legal, the sector produces and distributes legal goods and services. The criminal economy produces illegal goods and services. The informal economy also does not include the reproductive or care economy, which is made up of unpaid domestic work and care activities. The informal economy is part of the market economy, meaning it produces goods and services for sale and profit. Unpaid domestic work and care activities do not contribute to that, and as a result, are not a part of the informal economy.

==Statistics==

The informal economy under any governing system is diverse and includes small-scaled, occasional members (often street vendors and garbage recyclers) as well as larger, regular enterprises (including transit systems such as that of La Paz, Bolivia). Informal economies include garment workers working from their homes, as well as informally employed personnel of formal enterprises. Employees working in the informal sector can be classified as wage workers, non-wage workers, or a combination of both.

Statistics on the informal economy are unreliable by virtue of the subject, yet they can provide a tentative picture of its relevance. For example, informal employment makes up 58.7% of non-agricultural employment in Middle East – North Africa, 64.6% in Latin America, 79.4% in Asia, and 80.4% in sub-Saharan Africa. If agricultural employment is included, the percentages rise, in some countries like India and many sub-Saharan African countries beyond 90%. Estimates for developed countries are around 15%. In recent surveys, the informal economy in many regions has declined over the past 20 years to 2014. In Africa, the share of the informal economy has decreased to an estimate of around 40% of the economy.

In developing countries, the largest part of informal work, around 70%, is self-employed. Wage employment predominates. The majority of informal economy workers are women. Policies and developments affecting the informal economy have thus a distinctly gendered effect.

===Estimated size of countries&#x27; informal economy===
To estimate the size and development of any underground or shadow economy is quite a challenging task since participants in such economies attempt to hide their behaviors. One must also be very careful to distinguish whether one is attempting to measure the unreported economy, normally associated with tax evasion, or the unrecorded or non-observed economy, associated with the amount of income that is readily excluded from national income and produce accounts due to the difficulty of measurement.
There are numerous estimates of tax noncompliance as measured by tax gaps produced by audit methods or by &quot;top down&quot; methods.
Friedrich Schneider and several co-authors claim to have estimated the size and trend of what they call the &quot;shadow economy&quot; worldwide by a currency demand /MIMIC model approach that treats the &quot;shadow economy&quot; as a latent variable. Trevor S. Breusch has critiqued the work and warned the profession that the literature applying this model to the underground economy
abounds with alarming Procrustean tendencies. Various kinds of sliding and scaling of the results are carried out in the name of &quot;benchmarking&quot;, although these operations are not always clearly
documented. The data are typically transformed in ways that are not only undeclared but have the unfortunate effect of making the results of the study sensitive to the units in which the variables are measured.

The complexity of the estimation procedure, together with its deficient documentation, leave the reader unaware of how these results have been shorted to fit the bed of prior belief. There are many
other results in circulation for various countries, for which the data cannot be identified and which are given no more documentation than &quot;own calculations by the MIMIC method&quot;. Readers are advised to
adjust their valuation of these estimates accordingly.

Edgar L. Feige finds that Schneider&#x27;s shadow economy &quot;estimates suffer from conceptual flaws, apparent manipulation of results and insufficient documentation for replication, questioning their place in the academic, policy and popular literature&quot;.

===Comparison of shadow economies in EU countries===
As of 2013, the total EU shadow economy had been growing to about 1.9 trillion € in preparation of the EURO driven by the motor of the European shadow economy, Germany, which had been generating approx. 350 bn € per year since the establishment of the Single Market in Maastricht 1993, (see diagram on the right). Hence, the EU financial economy had developed an efficient tax haven bank system to protect and manage its growing shadow economy. As per the Financial Secrecy Index (FSI 2013) Germany and some neighbouring countries, ranked among the world&#x27;s top tax haven countries.

The diagram below shows that national informal economies per capita vary only moderately in most EU countries. This is because market sectors with a high proportion of informal economy (above 45%) like the construction sector or agriculture are rather homogeneously distributed across countries, whereas sectors with a low proportion of informal economy (below 30%) like the finance and business sector (e.g. in Switzerland, Luxembourg), the public service and personal Service Sector (as in Scandinavian countries) as well as the retail industry, wholesale and repair sector are dominant in countries with extremely high GDP per capita i.e. industrially highly developed countries. The diagram also shows that in absolute numbers the shadow economy per capita is related to the wealth of a society (GDP). Generally spoken, the higher the GDP the higher the shadow economy, albeit non-proportional.

There is a direct relationship between high self-employment of a country to its above average shadow economy. In highly industrialized countries where shadow economy (per capita) is high and the huge private sector is shared by an extremely small elite of entrepreneurs a considerable part of tax evasion is practised by a much smaller number of (elite) people. As an example German shadow economy in 2013 was €4.400 per capita, which was the 9th highest place in EU, whereas according to OECD only 11.2% of employed people were self-employed (place 18). On the other hand, Greece&#x27;s shadow economy was only €3.900 p.c (place 13) but self-employment was 36.9% (place 1).

An extreme example of shadow economy camouflaged by the financial market is Luxembourg where the relative annual shadow economy is only 8% of the GDP which is the second lowest percentage (2013) of all EU countries whereas its absolute size (€6.800 per capita) is the highest.

==Social and political implications and issues==

According to development and transition theories, workers in the informal sector typically earn less income, have unstable income, and do not have access to basic protections and services. The informal economy is also much larger than most people realize, with women playing a huge role. The working poor, particularly women, are concentrated in the informal economy, and most low-income households rely on the sector to provide for them. However, informal businesses can also lack the potential for growth, trapping employees in menial jobs indefinitely. On the other hand, the informal sector can allow a large proportion of the population to escape extreme poverty and earn an income that is satisfactory for survival. Also, in developed countries, some people who are formally employed may choose to perform part of their work outside of the formal economy, exactly because it delivers them more advantages. This is called &#x27;moonlighting&#x27;. They derive social protection, pension and child benefits and the like, from their formal employment, and at the same time have tax and other advantages from working on the side.

From the viewpoint of governments, the informal sector can create a vicious cycle. Being unable to collect taxes from the informal sector, the government may be hindered in financing public services, which in turn makes the sector more attractive. Conversely, some governments view informality as a benefit, enabling excess labor to be absorbed, and mitigating unemployment issues. Recognizing that the informal economy can produce significant goods and services, create necessary jobs, and contribute to imports and exports is critical for governments.

As the work in informal sector is not monitored or registered with the state, its workers are not entitled to social security, and they face unique challenges when affiliated in or creating trade unions. Informal economy workers are more likely to work long hours than workers in the formal economy who are protected by employment laws and regulations. A landmark study conducted by the World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization found that exposure to long working hours caused an estimated 745,000 fatalities from ischemic heart disease and stroke events in 2016. A systematic review and meta-analysis of health services use and health outcomes among informal economy workers, when compared with formal economy workers, found that these workers are less likely to use health services and more likely to have depression, highlighting their substantial health disadvantage.

===Gender===

In developing countries, most of the female non-agricultural labor force is in the informal sector. Female representation in the informal sector is attributed to a variety of factors. One such factor is that employment in the informal sector is the source of employment that is most readily available to women. A 2011 study of poverty in Bangladesh noted that cultural norms, religious seclusion, and illiteracy among women in many developing countries, along with a greater commitment to family responsibilities, prevent women from entering the formal sector.

Major occupations in the informal sector include home-based workers (such as dependent subcontract workers, independent own account producers, and unpaid workers in family businesses) and street vendors, which both are classified in the informal sector. Women tend to make up the greatest portion of the informal sector, often ending up in the most erratic and corrupt segments of the sector. In India, women working in the informal sector often work as ragpickers, domestic workers, coolies, vendors, beauticians, construction laborers, and garment workers.

According to a 2002 study commissioned by the ILO, the connection between employment in the informal economy and being poor is stronger for women than men. While men tend to be over-represented in the top segment of the informal sector, women overpopulate the bottom segment. Men are more likely to have larger-scale operations and deal in non-perishable items while few women are employers who hire others. Instead, women are more likely to be involved in smaller-scale operations and trade food items. Women are under-represented in higher-income employment positions in the informal economy and over-represented in lower-income statuses. As a result, the gender gap in terms of wage is higher in the informal sector than the formal sector. Labor markets, household decisions, and states all propagate this gender inequality.

===Political power of agents===
Workers in the informal economy lack a significant voice in government policy. Not only is the political power of informal workers limited, but the existence of the informal economy creates challenges for other politically influential actors. For example, the trade unions struggle to organize the informal economy and often formal workers organized in unions have no immediate interest in improving the status of informal workers due to fears of status loss. Yet the informal economy negatively affects membership and investment in the trade unions. Laborers who might be formally employed and join a union for protection may choose to branch out on their own instead. While this hostile attitude is not always the case, the nature of informal employment - low and irregular income that is not enough to pay union dues, fast-changing decentralized work locations and a self-perception of informal workers as self-employed pose barriers to informal economy trade union organizing. As a result, trade unions are inclined to oppose the informal sector, highlighting the costs and disadvantages of the system. Producers in the formal sector can similarly feel threatened by the informal economy. The flexibility of production, low labor and production costs, and bureaucratic freedom of the informal economy can be seen as consequential competition for formal producers, leading them to challenge and object to that sector. Last, the nature of the informal economy is largely anti-regulation and free of standard taxes, which diminishes the material and political power of government agents. Whatever the significance of these concerns are, the informal sector can shift political power and energies.

===Poverty===

The relationship between the informal sectors and poverty certainly is not simple nor does a clear, causal relationship exist. An inverse relationship between an increased informal sector and slower economic growth has been observed though.
Average incomes are substantially lower in the informal economy and there is a higher preponderance of impoverished employees working in the informal sector. In addition, workers in the informal economy are less likely to benefit from employment benefits and social protection programs. For instance, a survey in Europe shows that the respondents who have difficulties to pay their household bills have worked informally more often in the past year than those that do not (10% versus 3% of the respondents).

===Children and child labour===
Children work in the informal economy in many parts of the world. They often work as scavengers (collecting recyclables from the streets and dump sites), day laborers, cleaners, construction workers, vendors, in seasonal activities, domestic workers, and in small workshops; and often work under hazardous and exploitative conditions.
 It is common for children to work as domestic servants in parts of Latin America and parts of Asia. Such children are very vulnerable to exploitation: often they are not allowed to take breaks or are required to work long hours; many suffer from a lack of access to education, which can contribute to social isolation and a lack of future opportunity. UNICEF considers domestic work to be among the lowest status, and reports that most child domestic workers are live-in workers and are under the round-the-clock control of their employers. Some estimates suggest that among girls, domestic work is the most common form of employment.

During times of economic crisis many families experience unemployment and job loss, thus compelling adolescents to supplement their parents’ income by selling goods or services to contribute to the family economy. At the core, youth must compromise their social activities with other youth, and instead prioritize their participation in the informal economy, thus manufacturing a labor class of adolescents who must take on an adult role within the family. Although it revolves around a negative stigma of deviance, for a majority of individuals, mostly people of color, the informal economy is not an ideal choice but a necessity for survival. Participating in the informal economy is becoming normalized due to the lack of resources available in low-income and marginalized communities, and no matter how hard they have to work, will not advance in the economic hierarchy. When a parent is either unemployed or their job is on low demand, they are compelled to find other methods to provide for themselves but most importantly their children. Yet, due to all the limitations and the lack of jobs, children eventually cooperate with their parent/s and also work for their family&#x27;s economic well-being. By having to assist in providing for the family, children miss out on their childhood because instead of engaging in activities other youth their age participate in, they are obligated to take on an adult role, put the family first and contribute to the family&#x27;s well-being.

The participation of adolescents in the informal economy, is a contentious issue due to the restrictions and laws in place for youth have to work. One of the main dilemmas that arise when children engage in this type of work, is that privileged adults, denounce children participation as forced labor. Due to the participant being young, the adults are viewed as “bad” parents because first they cannot provide for their children, second they are stripping the child from a “normal” childhood, and third, child labor is frowned upon. Furthermore, certain people believe that children should not be working because children do not know the risks and the pressure of working and having so much responsibility, but the reality is that for most families, the children are not being forced to work, rather they choose to help sustain their family&#x27;s income. The youth become forced by their circumstances, meaning that because of their conditions, they do not have much of a choice. Youth have the capability to acknowledge their family&#x27;s financial limitations and many feel that it is their moral obligation to contribute to the family income. Thus, they end up working without asking for an allowance or wage, because kids recognize that their parents cannot bring home enough income alone, thus their contribution is necessary and their involvement becomes instrumental for their family&#x27;s economic survival.

Emir Estrada and Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo have gone to predominantly Latino communities of Los Angeles, CA. to observe the daily actions of street vendors. They analyze why adults participate in the informal economy. Although it revolves around a negative stigma of deviance, for a majority of individuals, the informal economy is not an ideal choice but an action necessary for survival. While witnessing the constant struggle of Latino individuals to make ends meet and trying to earn money to put food on the table, they witnessed how the participation of children either benefits the family or even hurt it. Through field notes derived from their participation, Estrada states, “children are not the ‘baggage’ that adult immigrants simply bring along. In the case of street vendors, we see that they are also contributors to family processes”. Estrada&#x27;s findings demonstrate that children are working in order to help contribute to their household income, but most importantly, they play a vital role when it comes to language barriers. The kids are not simply workers, they achieve an understanding of how to manage a business and commerce.

==Expansion and growth==
The division of the economy into formal and informal sectors has a long heritage. Arthur Lewis in his seminal work &quot;Economic Development with Unlimited Supply of Labour&quot;, published in the 1950s, was the celebrated paradigm of development for the newly independent countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The model assumed that the unorganized sector with the surplus labour will gradually disappear as the surplus labour gets absorbed in the organised sector. The Lewis model is drawn from the experience of capitalist countries in which the share of agriculture and unorganized sector showed a spectacular decline, but it didn&#x27;t prove to be true in many developing countries, including India. On the other hand, probabilistic migration models developed by Harris and Todaro in the 1970s envisaged the phenomenon of the informal sector as a transitional phase through which migrants move to the urban centers before shifting to formal sector employment. Hence it is not a surprise to see policy invisibility in the informal sector. Curiously, the informal sector does not find a permanent place in the Marxian theory since they anticipate the destruction of the pre-capitalist structure as a result of the aggressive growth of capitalism. To them, in the course of development, &#x27;the small fish is being eaten by the big fish&#x27;. Therefore, neither in the Marxian theory nor in the classical economic theory, the unorganized sector holds a permanent place in the economic literature.

The informal sector has been expanding as more economies have started to liberalize.
This pattern of expansion began in the 1960s when a lot of developing countries didn&#x27;t create enough formal jobs in their economic development plans, which led to the formation of an informal sector that didn&#x27;t solely include marginal work and actually contained profitable opportunities. In the 1980s, the sector grew alongside formal industrial sectors. In the 1990s, an increase in global communication and competition led to a restructuring of production and distribution, often relying more heavily on the informal sector.

Over the past decade, the informal economy is said to account for more than half of the newly created jobs in Latin America. In Africa it accounts for around eighty percent. Many explanations exist as to why the informal sector has been expanding in the developing world throughout the past few decades. It is possible that the kind of development that has been occurring has failed to support the increased labor force in a formal manner. Expansion can also be explained by the increased subcontracting due to globalization and economic liberalization. Finally, employers could be turning toward the informal sector to lower costs and cope with increased competition.

Such extreme competition between industrial countries occurred after the expansion of the EC to markets of the then new member countries Greece, Spain and Portugal, and particularly after the establishment of the Single European Market (1993, Treaty of Maastricht). Mainly for French and German corporations it led to systematic increase of their informal sectors under liberalized tax laws, thus fostering their mutual competitiveness and against small local competitors. The continuous systematic increase of the German informal sector was stopped only after the establishment of the EURO and the execution of the Summer Olympic Games 2004, which has been the first and (up to now) only in the Single Market. Since then the German informal sector stabilized on the achieved 350 bn € level which signifies an extremely high tax evasion for a country with 90% salary-employment.

According to the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the key drivers for the growth of the informal economy in the twenty-first century include:
* limited absorption of labour, particularly in countries with high rates of population or urbanisation
* excessive cost and regulatory barriers of entry into the formal economy, often motivated by corruption
* weak institutions, limiting education and training opportunities as well as infrastructure development
* increasing demand for low-cost goods and services
* migration motivated by economic hardship and poverty
* difficulties faced by women in gaining formal employment

Historically, development theories have asserted that as economies mature and develop, economic activity will shift from the informal to the formal sphere. In fact, much of the economic development discourse is centered around the notion that formalization indicates how developed a country&#x27;s economy is; for more on this discussion see the page on fiscal capacity. However, evidence suggests that the progression from informal to formal sectors is not universally applicable. While the characteristics of a formalized economy – full employment and an extensive welfare system – have served as effective methods of organizing work and welfare for some nations, such a structure is not necessarily inevitable or ideal. Indeed, development appears to be heterogeneous in different localities, regions, and nations, as well as the type of work practiced. For example, at one end of the spectrum of the type of work practiced in the informal economy are small-scale businesses and manufacturing; on the other &quot;street vendors, shoe shiners, junk collectors and domestic servants.&quot; Regardless of how the informal economy develops, its continued growth that it cannot be considered a temporary phenomenon.

==Policy suggestions==

As it has been historically stigmatized, policy perspectives viewed the informal sector as disruptive to the national economy and a hindrance to development. The justifications for such criticisms include viewing the informal economy as a fraudulent activity that results in a loss of revenue from taxes, weakens unions, creates unfair competition, leads to a loss of regulatory control on the government&#x27;s part, reduces observance of health and safety standards, and reduces the availability of employment benefits and rights. These characteristics have led to many nations pursuing a policy of deterrence with strict regulation and punitive procedures.

In a 2004 report, the Department for Infrastructure and Economic Cooperation under SIDA explained three perspectives on the role of government and policy in relation to the informal economy.
* Markets function efficiently on their own; government interference would only lead to inefficiency and dysfunction.
* The informal economy functions outside of government control, largely because those who participate wish to avoid regulation and taxation.
* The informal economy is enduring; suitable regulation and policies are required.

As informal economy has significant job creation and income generation potential, as well as the capacity to meet the needs of poor consumers by providing cheaper and more accessible goods and services, many stakeholders subscribe to the third perspective and support government intervention and accommodation. Embedded in the third perspective is the significant expectation that governments will revise policies that have favored the formal sphere at the expense of the informal sector.

Theories of how to accommodate the informal economy argue for government policies that, recognizing the value and importance of the informal sector, regulate and restrict when necessary but generally work to improve working conditions and increase efficiency and production.

The challenge for policy interventions is that so many different types of informal work exist; a solution would have to provide for a diverse range of circumstances. A possible strategy would be to provide better protections and benefits to informal sector players. However, such programs could lead to a disconnect between the labor market and protections, which would not actually improve informal employment conditions. In a 2014 report monitoring street vending, WIEGO suggested urban planners and local economic development strategists study the carrying capacity of areas regularly used by informal workers and deliver the urban infrastructure necessary to support the informal economy, including running water and toilets, street lights and regular electricity, and adequate shelter and storage facilities. That study also called for basic legal rights and protections for informal workers, such as appropriate licensing and permit practices.

An ongoing policy debate considers the value of government tax breaks for household services such as cleaning, babysitting and home maintenance, with an aim to reduce the shadow economy&#x27;s impact. There are currently systems in place in Sweden and France which offer 50 percent tax breaks for home cleaning services. There has also been debate in the UK about introducing a similar scheme, with potentially large savings for middle-class families and greater incentive for women to return to work after having children. The European Union has used political measures to try to curb the shadow economy. Although no definitive solution has been established, the EU council has led dialogue on a platform that would combat undeclared work.

The World Bank&#x27;s 2019 World Development Report on &quot;The Changing Nature of Work&quot; discusses the extension of social assistance and insurance schemes to informal workers given that, in 2018, 8 in 10 people in developing countries still receive no social assistance and 6 in 10 work informally.

== Asia-Pacific ==
The International Labour Organization mentioned that in most developing nations located in the Asia-Pacific, the informal sector comprises a significant and vital percentage of the labor force. This sector constitutes around 60 percent of the labor force. Informal economy includes economic activities of laborers (legally and in practice) which are not or inadequately covered by official employment contracts or agreements. Informal employment means payment of wagers may not be guaranteed and retrenchment can be implemented without prior notice or compensation from employers. There are generally substandard health and safety conditions as well as nonexistence of social benefits which include sick pay, pension, and health coverage. The informal economy absorbs a larger part of the ever-growing workforce in urban hubs. In 2015, urban populations of Asian countries started to grow while the service sector also continued to increase. These developments contributed to the extensive expansion of urban informal economy in practically all of Asia.

In India, the country&#x27;s informal sector accounted for over 80 percent of the non-agricultural industry during the last 20 years. Inadequate employment denotes the option for majority of India&#x27;s citizens is to find work in the informal sector which continues to grow because of the contract system and outsourcing of production. An article in First Post (June 2018) said approximately 1.3 billion people or more than 68 percent of employed persons in the Asia-Pacific earn through the informal economy. It is prevalent in the countryside (around 85 percent) and almost 48 percent in urban locations. 2 billion of the global population (61 percent) works in the informal sector. According to an article published in Eco-Business in June 2018, the informal sector has emerged as an essential component of the economic environment of cities in this region. Henceforth, the importance of contribution of informal workers deserves recognition.

<text>Secrecy is the practice of hiding information from certain individuals or groups who do not have the &quot;need to know&quot;, perhaps while sharing it with other individuals. That which is kept hidden is known as the secret.

Secrecy is often controversial, depending on the content or nature of the secret, the group or people keeping the secret, and the motivation for secrecy.

Secrecy by government entities is often decried as excessive or in promotion of poor operation; excessive revelation of information on individuals can conflict with virtues of privacy and confidentiality. It is often contrasted with social transparency.

Secrecy can exist in a number of different ways: encoding or encryption (where mathematical and technical strategies are used to hide messages), true secrecy (where restrictions are put upon those who take part of the message, such as through government security classification) and obfuscation, where secrets are hidden in plain sight behind complex idiosyncratic language (jargon) or steganography.

Another classification proposed by Claude Shannon in 1948 reads that there are three systems of secrecy within communication:
# Concealment systems, including such methods as invisible ink, concealing a message in a harmless text in a fake covering cryptogram, or other methods in which the existence of the message is concealed from the enemy.
# Privacy systems, for example, voice inversion, is a special equipment required to recover the message.
# &quot;True&quot; secrecy systems where the meaning of the message is concealed by the cypher, code, etc. Although, its existence is not hidden. The enemy is assumed to have any special equipment necessary to intercept and record the transmitted signal.

== Sociology ==

Animals conceal the location of their den or nest from predators. Squirrels bury nuts, hiding them, and they try to remember their locations later.

Humans attempt to consciously conceal aspects of themselves from others due to shame, or from fear of violence, rejection, harassment, loss of acceptance, or loss of employment. Humans may also attempt to conceal aspects of their own self which they are not capable of incorporating psychologically into their conscious being. Families sometimes maintain &quot;family secrets&quot;, obliging family members never to discuss disagreeable issues concerning the family with outsiders or sometimes even within the family. Many &quot;family secrets&quot; are maintained by using a mutually agreed-upon construct (an official family story) when speaking with outside members. Agreement to maintain the secret is often coerced through &quot;shaming&quot; and reference to family honor. The information may even be something as trivial as a recipe.

Secrets are sometimes kept to provide the pleasure of surprise. This includes keeping secret about a surprise party, not telling spoilers of a story, and avoiding exposure of a magic trick.

Keeping one&#x27;s strategy &quot;secret&quot;– is important in many aspects of game theory.

In anthropology secret sharing is one way for people to establish traditional relations with other people. A commonly used narrative that describes this kind of behavior is Joseph Conrad&#x27;s short story &quot;The Secret Sharer&quot;.

== Government ==
Governments often attempt to conceal information from other governments and the public. These state secrets can include weapon designs, military plans, diplomatic negotiation tactics, and secrets obtained illicitly from others (&quot;intelligence&quot;). Most nations have some form of Official Secrets Act (the Espionage Act in the U.S.) and classify material according to the level of protection needed (hence the term &quot;classified information&quot;). An individual needs a security clearance for access and other protection methods, such as keeping documents in a safe, are stipulated.

Few people dispute the desirability of keeping Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information secret, but many believe government secrecy to be excessive and too often employed for political purposes. Many countries have laws that attempt to limit government secrecy, such as the U.S. Freedom of Information Act and sunshine laws. Government officials sometimes leak information they are supposed to keep secret. (&quot;For a recent (2005) example, see Plame affair.&quot;)

Secrecy in elections is a growing issue, particularly secrecy of vote counts on computerized vote counting machines. While voting, citizens are acting in a unique sovereign or &quot;owner&quot; capacity (instead of being a subject of the laws, as is true outside of elections) in selecting their government servants. It is argued that secrecy is impermissible as against the public in the area of elections where the government gets all of its power and taxing authority. In any event, permissible secrecy varies significantly with the context involved.

==Corporations==
Organizations, ranging from multi-national for profit corporations to nonprofit charities, keep secrets for competitive advantage, to meet legal requirements, or, in some cases, to conceal nefarious behavior. New products under development, unique manufacturing techniques, or simply lists of customers are types of information protected by trade secret laws.

Research on corporate secrecy has studied the factors supporting secret organizations. In particular, scholars in economics and management have paid attention to the way firms participating in cartels work together to maintain secrecy and conceal their activities from antitrust authorities. The diversity of the participants (in terms of age and size of the firms) influences their ability to coordinate to avoid being detected.

The patent system encourages inventors to publish information in exchange for a limited time monopoly on its use, though patent applications are initially secret. Secret societies use secrecy as a way to attract members by creating a sense of importance.

Shell companies may be used to launder money from criminal activity, to finance terrorism, or to evade taxes. Registers of beneficial ownership aim at fighting corporate secrecy in that sense.

Other laws &quot;require&quot; organizations to keep certain information secret, such as medical records (HIPAA in the U.S.), or financial reports that are under preparation (to limit insider trading). Europe has particularly strict laws about database privacy.

== Computing ==
Preservation of secrets is one of the goals of information security. Techniques used include physical security and cryptography. The latter depends on the secrecy of cryptographic keys. Many believe that security technology can be more effective if it itself is not kept secret.

Information hiding is a design principle in much software engineering. It is considered easier to verify software reliability if one can be sure that different parts of the program can only access (and therefore depend on) a known limited amount of information.

== Military ==
Military secrecy is the concealing of information about martial affairs that is purposely not made available to the general public and hence to any enemy, in order to gain an advantage or to not reveal a weakness, to avoid embarrassment, or to help in propaganda efforts. Most military secrets are tactical in nature, such as the strengths and weaknesses of weapon systems, tactics, training methods, plans, and the number and location of specific weapons. Some secrets involve information in broader areas, such as secure communications, cryptography, intelligence operations, and cooperation with third parties.

US Government rights in regard to military secrecy were uphold in the landmark legal case of &quot;United States v. Reynolds&quot;, decided by the Supreme Court in 1953.

== Views ==
Excessive secrecy is often cited as a source of much human conflict. One may have to lie in order to hold a secret, which might lead to psychological repercussions. The alternative, declining to answer when asked something, may suggest the answer and may therefore not always be suitable for keeping a secret. Also, the other may insist that one answer the question.

Nearly 2500 years ago, Sophocles wrote: &#x27;Do nothing secretly; for Time sees and hears all things, and discloses all.&#x27;. Gautama Siddhartha said: &quot;Three things cannot long stay hidden: the sun, the moon and the truth.&quot;.

<doc id="66511" wikidata="Q1088528" url="?curid=66511" title="MX record">
<text>A mail exchanger record (MX record) specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name. It is a resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS). It is possible to configure several MX records, typically pointing to an array of mail servers for load balancing and redundancy. 

==Overview==
Resource records are the basic information element of the Domain Name System (DNS). An MX record is one of these, and a domain may have one or more of these set up, as below:
The characteristic payload information of an MX record is a preference value (above labelled &quot;Priority&quot;), and the domain name of a mailserver (&quot;Host&quot; above). 

The priority field identifies which mailserver should be preferred - in this case the values are both 10, so mail would be expected to flow evenly to both &quot;onemail.example.com&quot; and &quot;twomail.example.com&quot; - a common configuration. The host name must map directly to one or more address records (A, or AAAA) in the DNS, and must not point to any CNAME records.

When an e-mail message is sent through the Internet, the sending mail transfer agent (MTA) queries the Domain Name System for the MX records of each recipient&#x27;s domain name. This query returns a list of host names of mail exchange servers accepting incoming mail for that domain and their preferences. The sending agent then attempts to establish an SMTP connection, trying the host with the lowest &quot;Priority&quot; value first. The system allows high-availability clusters of mail gateways to be built for one domain if necessary.

The MX mechanism does not grant the ability to provide mail service on alternative port numbers, nor does it provide the ability to distribute mail delivery across a set of unequal-priority mail servers by assigning a weighting value to each one.

==MX preference, distance, and priority==
According to RFC 5321, the lowest-numbered records are the most preferred. This phrasing can be confusing, and so the &quot;preference number&quot; is sometimes referred to as the &quot;distance&quot;: smaller distances are more preferable. An older RFC, RFC 974, indicates that when the preference numbers are the same for two servers, they have the same &quot;priority&quot;, hence those two terms are used interchangeably.

The preference number is an unsigned 16-bit field, thus valid values range from 0 to 65535.

===The basics===
In the simplest case, a domain may have just one mail server. For example, if an MTA looks up the MX records for example.com, and the DNS server replied with only mail.example.com with a preference number of 50, then the MTA will attempt delivery of the mail to the server listed. In this case, the number 50 could have been any integer permitted by the SMTP specification.

When more than one server is returned for an MX query, the server with the smallest preference number must be tried first. If there is more than one MX record with the same preference number, all of those must be tried before moving on to lower-priority entries. An SMTP client &quot;must&quot; be able to try (and retry) each of the relevant addresses in the list in order, until a delivery attempt succeeds.

===Load distribution===
The standard approach to distributing a load of incoming mail over an array of servers is to return the same preference number for each server in the set. When determining which server of equal preference to send mail to, &quot;the sender-SMTP MUST randomize them to spread the load across multiple mail exchangers for a specific organization&quot;, unless there is a clear reason to favor one. 

An alternative approach is to use multihomed servers, where the one host returns several IP addresses. This method places the burden on the DNS rather than the SMTP-sender to perform the load balancing, which in this case will present a list of IP addresses in a specific order to the clients querying the A record of the mail exchanger. Since the RFC requires that the SMTP-sender use the order given in the A record query, the DNS server is free to carefully manipulate its balancing based on any method, including round robin DNS, mail server load, or some undisclosed priority scheme.

===&quot;Backup&quot; MX===
Some domains will have several MX records, one of which is intended as a &quot;backup&quot; - with a higher preference number so that it would not normally be picked as the target for email delivery. 

However, in the case of errors from the lower-numbered hosts, (perhaps due to an outage of some sort), sending email servers will deliver to the &quot;backup&quot; host - &quot;queue.example.com&quot; in the example below:

If the backup server has direct access to user mailboxes, mail will proceed there, but otherwise will likely be queued on &quot;queue.example.com&quot; until the outage is resolved.

In the absence of this sort of arrangement, when a domain&#x27;s mail servers are all offline, &quot;sending&quot; servers are required to queue messages destined for that domain to retry later. However, these sending servers have no way of being notified that a previously offline domain&#x27;s servers are now available, and so resort to a polling schedule - and will only discover that the domain is available whenever they next attempt delivery. The delay between when a receiving domain&#x27;s servers come online and when delayed messages are finally delivered can be therefore anywhere from minutes to days, depending on the retry schedule of the sending servers - and the receiving domain has no visibility or control over this.

===Spammers===
Spammers may deliberately direct mail to one of the backup (high distance) MX servers of a domain first, on the assumption that such a server will have less effective anti-spam filters. An anti-spam technique called nolisting is based on assuming this behaviour.

==Handling of delivery failure==
The SMTP RFC is ambiguous about exactly what kinds of delivery failure must result in re-attempting delivery via more distant MX records (those with higher preference values).

When servers indicate temporary failures, either by explicitly sending a 4xx error or by ending the connection unexpectedly (which must be treated as a 451 error, according to Section 3.8 of the RFC), Section 4.5.4.1 says:
However, when the sender retries, the RFC is silent about whether this should be to the same server, or a more &quot;distant&quot; MX record. It does say, in Section 5.1:
Some servers (such as Sendmail and Postfix 2.1 or later), will attempt the next-furthest MX server after some types of temporary delivery failures, such as greeting failures. Other servers (such as qmail and Postfix 2.0 or earlier) will only use more distant MX records if the servers specified in the shortest-distance MX records could not be contacted at all. Despite the difference, both behaviors are valid - since the RFC is not specific.

==Fallback to the address record==
In the absence of an MX record, email senders will attempt delivery to the address record - e.g. example.com.

This is based on RFC 5321 sec. 5.1, which states :
* SMTP clients must look up an MX record;
* If (&quot;and only if&quot;) no MX record for the domain is present, treat the domain as if it had an MX record with the given domain as the target hostname and a preference value of 0
* Perform A or AAAA lookups as required to determine the IP address of the target hostname

===Historical background===
RFC 821 was published in 1982. It makes only passing references to DNS, because at the time the transition from HOSTS.TXT to the DNS had not yet started. RFC 883, the first description of the DNS, was published over a year later in late 1983. It described the experimental and little used MD and MF records. According to RFC 897 and RFC 921, the transition to DNS started in 1983, but HOSTS.TXT was not scheduled to be phased out until the end of 1985 and was not totally phased out until the late 1990s.

In January 1986, RFC 973 and RFC 974 deprecated the MD and MF records, replaced them with MX, and defined the MX lookup with fallback to A. RFC 974 recommends that clients do a WKS lookup on each MX host to see if it actually supports SMTP and discard the MX entry if not. However, RFC 1123 changed this to say that WKS &quot;should not&quot; be checked.

This means that SMTP had been in use for at least a year using HOSTS.TXT, and then another couple of years using A, MD, and MF, before MX came along. MD and MF were hard to use, so most people just used the A record. Under the circumstances, MX without fallback to A would not have worked because of the substantial installed base of mail servers using A records. The early use of MX was to identify gateways to other networks, but it did not come into wide use until the DNS was well established in the early 1990s.

<doc id="66512" wikidata="Q80005" url="?curid=66512" title="Fern">
<text>The ferns (Polypodiopsida or Polypodiophyta) are a group of vascular plants (plants with xylem and phloem) that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having specialized tissues that conduct water and nutrients, and in having life cycles in which the branched sporophyte is the dominant phase.

Ferns have complex leaves called megaphylls that are more complex than the microphylls of clubmosses. Most ferns are leptosporangiate ferns. They produce coiled fiddleheads that uncoil and expand into fronds. The group includes about 10,560 known extant species. Ferns are defined here in the broad sense, being all of the Polypodiopsida, comprising both the leptosporangiate (Polypodiidae) and eusporangiate ferns, the latter group including horsetails, whisk ferns, marattioid ferns, and ophioglossoid ferns.

The fern crown group, consisting of the leptosporangiates and eusporangiates, is estimated to have originated in the late Silurian period 423.2 million years ago, but Polypodiales, the group that makes up 80% of living fern diversity, did not appear and diversify until the Cretaceous, contemporaneous with the rise of flowering plants that came to dominate the world&#x27;s flora.

Ferns are not of major economic importance, but some are used for food, medicine, as biofertilizer, as ornamental plants, and for remediating contaminated soil. They have been the subject of research for their ability to remove some chemical pollutants from the atmosphere. Some fern species, such as bracken (&quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot;) and water fern (&quot;Azolla filiculoides&quot;), are significant weeds worldwide. Some fern genera, such as &quot;Azolla&quot;, can fix nitrogen and make a significant input to the nitrogen nutrition of rice paddies. They also play certain roles in folklore.

==Description==

=== Sporophyte ===

Extant ferns are herbaceous perennials and most lack woody growth. When woody growth is present, it is found in the stem. Their foliage may be deciduous or evergreen, and some are semi-evergreen depending on the climate. Like the sporophytes of seed plants, those of ferns consist of stems, leaves and roots. Ferns differ from spermatophytes in that they reproduce by spores rather than having flowers and producing seeds. However, they also differ from spore-producing bryophytes in that, like seed plants, they are polysporangiophytes, their sporophytes branching and producing many sporangia. Also unlike bryophytes, fern sporophytes are free-living and only briefly dependent on the maternal gametophyte.

The green, photosynthetic part of the plant is technically a megaphyll and in ferns, it is often called a &quot;frond&quot;. New leaves typically expand by the unrolling of a tight spiral called a crozier or fiddlehead into fronds. This uncurling of the leaf is termed circinate vernation. Leaves are divided into two types: sporophylls and tropophylls. Sporophylls produce spores; tropophylls do not. Fern spores are borne in sporangia which are usually clustered to form sori. The sporangia may be covered with a protective coating called an indusium. The arrangement of the sporangia is important in classification.

In monomorphic ferns, the fertile and sterile leaves look morphologically the same, and both are able to photosynthesize. In hemidimorphic ferns, just a portion of the fertile leaf is different from the sterile leaves. In dimorphic (holomorphic) ferns, the two types of leaves are morphologically distinct. The fertile leaves are much narrower than the sterile leaves, and may have no green tissue at all, as in the Blechnaceae and Lomariopsidaceae.

The anatomy of fern leaves can be anywhere from simple to highly divided, or even indeterminate (e.g. Gleicheniaceae, Lygodiaceae). The divided forms are pinnate, where the leaf segments are completely separated from one other, or pinnatifid (partially pinnate), where the leaf segments are still partially connected. When the fronds are branched more than once, it can also be a combination of the pinnatifid are pinnate shapes. If the leaf blades are divided twice, the plant has bipinnate fronds, and tripinnate fronds if they branch three times, and all the way to tetra- and pentapinnate fronds. In tree ferns, the main stalk that connects the leaf to the stem (known as the stipe), often has multiple leaflets. The leafy structures that grow from the stipe are known as pinnae and are often again divided into smaller pinnules.

Fern stems are often loosely called rhizomes, even though they grow underground only in some of the species. Epiphytic species and many of the terrestrial ones have above-ground creeping stolons (e.g., Polypodiaceae), and many groups have above-ground erect semi-woody trunks (e.g., Cyatheaceae, the scaly tree ferns). These can reach up to tall in a few species (e.g., &quot;Cyathea brownii&quot; on Norfolk Island and &quot;Cyathea medullaris&quot; in New Zealand).

Roots are underground non-photosynthetic structures that take up water and nutrients from soil. They are always fibrous and are structurally very similar to the roots of seed plants.

=== Gametophyte ===

As in all vascular plants, the sporophyte is the dominant phase or generation in the life cycle. The gametophytes of ferns, however, are very different from those of seed plants. They are free-living and resemble liverworts, whereas those of seed plants develop within the spore wall and are dependent on the parent sporophyte for their nutrition. A fern gametophyte typically consists of:

* Prothallus: A green, photosynthetic structure that is one cell thick, usually heart or kidney shaped, 3–10 mm long and 2–8 mm broad. The prothallus produces gametes by means of:
** Antheridia: Small spherical structures that produce flagellate antherozoids.
** Archegonia: A flask-shaped structure that produces a single egg at the bottom, reached by the male gametophyte by swimming down the neck.
* Rhizoids: root-like structures (not true roots) that consist of single greatly elongated cells, that absorb water and mineral salts over the whole structure. Rhizoids anchor the prothallus to the soil.

== Life cycle and reproduction ==

The lifecycle of a fern involves two stages, as in club mosses and horsetails. In stage one, the spores are produced by sporophytes in sporangia, which are clustered together in sori (&quot;s.g. sorus&quot;), developing on the underside of fertile fronds. In stage two, the spores germinate into a short-lived structure anchored to the ground by rhizoids called gametophyte which produce gametes. When a mature fertile frond bears sori, and spores are released, the spores will settle on the soil and send out rhizoids, while it develops into a prothallus. The prothallus bears spherical antheridia (&quot;s.g. antheridium&quot;) which produce antherozoids (male gametophytes) and archegonia (&quot;s.g. archegonium&quot;) which release a single oosphere. The antherozoid swims up the archegonium and fertilize the oosphere, resulting in a zygote, which will grow into a separate sporophyte, while the gametophyte shortly persists as a free-living plant.

== Taxonomy ==

Carl Linnaeus (1753) originally recognized 15 genera of ferns and fern allies, classifying them in class Cryptogamia in two groups, Filices (e.g. &quot;Polypodium&quot;) and Musci (mosses). By 1806 this had increased to 38 genera, and has progressively increased since (&quot;see &quot;). Ferns were traditionally classified in the class Filices, and later in a Division of the Plant Kingdom named Pteridophyta or Filicophyta. Pteridophyta is no longer recognised as a valid taxon because it is paraphyletic. The ferns are also referred to as Polypodiophyta or, when treated as a subdivision of Tracheophyta (vascular plants), Polypodiopsida, although this name sometimes only refers to leptosporangiate ferns. Traditionally, all of the spore producing vascular plants were informally denominated the pteridophytes, rendering the term synonymous with ferns and fern allies. This can be confusing because members of the division Pteridophyta were also denominated pteridophytes (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;).

Traditionally, three discrete groups have been denominated ferns: two groups of eusporangiate ferns, the families Ophioglossaceae (adder&#x27;s tongues, moonworts, and grape ferns) and Marattiaceae; and the leptosporangiate ferns. The Marattiaceae are a primitive group of tropical ferns with large, fleshy rhizomes and are now thought to be a sibling taxon to the leptosporangiate ferns. Several other groups of species were considered fern allies: the clubmosses, spikemosses, and quillworts in Lycopodiophyta; the whisk ferns of Psilotaceae; and the horsetails of Equisetaceae. Since this grouping is polyphyletic, the term fern allies should be abandoned, except in a historical context. More recent genetic studies demonstrated that the Lycopodiophyta are more distantly related to other vascular plants, having radiated evolutionarily at the base of the vascular plant clade, while both the whisk ferns and horsetails are as closely related to leptosporangiate ferns as the ophioglossoid ferns and Marattiaceae. In fact, the whisk ferns and ophioglossoid ferns are demonstrably a clade, and the horsetails and Marattiaceae are arguably another clade.

=== Molecular phylogenetics ===

Smith et al. (2006) carried out the first higher-level pteridophyte classification published in the molecular phylogenetic era, and considered the ferns as monilophytes, as follows:
* Division Tracheophyta (tracheophytes) – vascular plants
** Sub division Euphyllophytina (euphyllophytes)
*** Infradivision Moniliformopses (monilophytes)
*** Infradivision Spermatophyta – seed plants, ~260,000 species
** Subdivision Lycopodiophyta (lycophytes) – less than 1% of extant vascular plants

Molecular data, which remain poorly constrained for many parts of the plants&#x27; phylogeny, have been supplemented by morphological observations supporting the inclusion of Equisetaceae in the ferns, notably relating to the construction of their sperm and peculiarities of their roots.

The leptosporangiate ferns are sometimes called &quot;true ferns&quot;. This group includes most plants familiarly known as ferns. Modern research supports older ideas based on morphology that the Osmundaceae diverged early in the evolutionary history of the leptosporangiate ferns; in certain ways this family is intermediate between the eusporangiate ferns and the leptosporangiate ferns. Rai and Graham (2010) broadly supported the primary groups, but queried their relationships, concluding that &quot;at present perhaps the best that can be said about all relationships among the major lineages of monilophytes in current studies is that we do not understand them very well&quot;. Grewe et al. (2013) confirmed the inclusion of horsetails within ferns &quot;sensu lato&quot;, but also suggested that uncertainties remained in their precise placement. Other classifications have raised Ophioglossales to the rank of a fifth class, separating the whisk ferns and ophioglossoid ferns.

=== Phylogeny ===

The ferns are related to other groups as shown in the following cladogram:
=== Nomenclature and subdivision ===

The classification of Smith et al. in 2006 treated ferns as four classes:

* Equisetopsida (Sphenopsida) – 1 order, Equisetales (Horsetails) ~ 15 species
* Psilotopsida – 2 orders (whisk ferns and ophioglossoid ferns) ~92 species 
* Marattiopsida – 1 order, Marattiales ~ 150 species
* Polypodiopsida (Filicopsida) – 7 orders (leptosporangiate ferns) ~ 9,000 species

In addition they defined 11 orders and 37 families. That system was a consensus of a number of studies, and was further refined. The phylogenetic relationships are shown in the following cladogram (to the level of orders). This division into four major clades was then confirmed using morphology alone.

Subsequently, Chase and Reveal considered both lycopods and ferns as subclasses of a class Equisetopsida (Embryophyta) encompassing all land plants. This is referred to as Equisetopsida &quot;sensu lato&quot; to distinguish it from the narrower use to refer to horsetails alone, Equisetopsida &quot;sensu stricto&quot;. They placed the lycopods into subclass Lycopodiidae and the ferns, keeping the term monilophytes, into five subclasses, Equisetidae, Ophioglossidae, Psilotidae, Marattiidae and Polypodiidae, by dividing Smith&#x27;s Psilotopsida into its two orders and elevating them to subclass (Ophioglossidae and Psilotidae). Christenhusz et al. (2011) followed this use of subclasses but recombined Smith&#x27;s Psilotopsida as Ophioglossidae, giving four subclasses of ferns again.

Christenhusz and Chase (2014) developed a new classification of ferns and lycopods. They used the term Polypodiophyta for the ferns, subdivided like Smith et al. into four groups (shown with equivalents in the Smith system), with 21 families, approximately 212 genera and 10,535 species;
* Equisetidae (=Equisetopsida) – monotypic (Equisetales, Equisetaceae, &quot;Equisetum&quot;) horsetails ~ 20 species)
* Ophioglossidae (=Psilotopsida) – 2 monotypic orders ~ 92 species
* Marattiidae (=Marattiopsida) – 1 monotypic order (Marattiales, Marattiaceae, 2 subfamilies) ~ 130 species
* Polypodiidae (=Polypodiopsida) – 7 orders

This was a considerable reduction in the number of families from the 37 in the system of Smith et al., since the approach was more that of lumping rather than splitting. For instance a number of families were reduced to subfamilies. Subsequently, a consensus group was formed, the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (PPG), analogous to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, publishing their first complete classification in November 2016. They recognise ferns as a class, the Polypodiopsida, with four subclasses as described by Christenhusz and Chase, and which are phylogenetically related as in this cladogram:

In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the Polypodiopsida consist of four subclasses, 11 orders, 48 families, 319 genera, and an estimated 10,578 species. Thus Polypodiopsida in the broad sense (&quot;sensu lato&quot;) as used by the PPG (Polypodiopsida &quot;sensu&quot; PPG I) needs to be distinguished from the narrower usage (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;) of Smith et al. (Polypodiopsida &quot;sensu&quot; Smith et al.) Classification of ferns remains unresolved and controversial with competing viewpoints (splitting vs lumping) between the systems of the PPG on the one hand and Christenhusz and Chase on the other, respectively. In 2018, Christenhusz and Chase explicitly argued against recognizing as many genera as PPG I.

=== Evolution and biogeography ===

Fern-like taxa (&quot;Wattieza&quot;) first appear in the fossil record in the middle Devonian period, ca. 390 Mya. By the Triassic, the first evidence of ferns related to several modern families appeared. The great fern radiation occurred in the late Cretaceous, when many modern families of ferns first appeared. Ferns evolved to cope with low-light conditions present under the canopy of angiosperms.

Remarkably, the photoreceptor neochrome in the two orders Cyatheales and Polypodiales, integral to their adaptation to low-light conditions, was obtained via horizontal gene transfer from hornworts, a bryophyte lineage.

Due to the very large genome seen in most ferns, it was suspected they might have gone through whole genome duplications, but DNA sequencing has shown that their genome size is caused by the accumulation of mobile DNA like transposons and other genetic elements that infect genomes and get copied over and over again.

Ferns appear to have evolved extrafloral nectaries 135 million years ago, nearly simultaneously with the trait&#x27;s evolution in angiosperms. However, nectary-associated diversifications in ferns did not hit their stride until nearly 100 million years later, in the Cenozoic. There is weak support for the rise of fern-feeding arthropods driving this diversification.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Ferns are widespread in their distribution, with the greatest richness in the tropics and least in arctic areas. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical rainforests. New Zealand, for which the fern is a symbol, has about 230 species, distributed throughout the country. It is a common plant in European forests.

== Ecology ==

Fern species live in a wide variety of habitats, from remote mountain elevations, to dry desert rock faces, bodies of water or open fields. Ferns in general may be thought of as largely being specialists in marginal habitats, often succeeding in places where various environmental factors limit the success of flowering plants. Some ferns are among the world&#x27;s most serious weed species, including the bracken fern growing in the Scottish highlands, or the mosquito fern (&quot;Azolla&quot;) growing in tropical lakes, both species forming large aggressively spreading colonies. There are four particular types of habitats that ferns are found in: moist, shady forests; crevices in rock faces, especially when sheltered from the full sun; acid wetlands including bogs and swamps; and tropical trees, where many species are epiphytes (something like a quarter to a third of all fern species).

Especially the epiphytic ferns have turned out to be hosts of a huge diversity of invertebrates. It is assumed that bird&#x27;s-nest ferns alone contain up to half the invertebrate biomass within a hectare of rainforest canopy.

Many ferns depend on associations with mycorrhizal fungi. Many ferns grow only within specific pH ranges; for instance, the climbing fern (&quot;Lygodium palmatum&quot;) of eastern North America will grow only in moist, intensely acid soils, while the bulblet bladder fern (&quot;Cystopteris bulbifera&quot;), with an overlapping range, is found only on limestone.

The spores are rich in lipids, protein and calories, so some vertebrates eat these. The European woodmouse (&quot;Apodemus sylvaticus&quot;) has been found to eat the spores of &quot;Culcita macrocarpa&quot;, and the bullfinch (&quot;Pyrrhula murina&quot;) and the New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat (&quot;Mystacina tuberculata&quot;) also eat fern spores.

=== Life cycle ===

Ferns are vascular plants differing from lycophytes by having true leaves (megaphylls), which are often pinnate. They differ from seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms) in reproducing by means of spores and lacking flowers and seeds. Like all land plants, they have a life cycle referred to as alternation of generations, characterized by alternating diploid sporophytic and haploid gametophytic phases. The diploid sporophyte has 2&quot;n&quot; paired chromosomes, where &quot;n&quot; varies from species to species. The haploid gametophyte has &quot;n&quot; unpaired chromosomes, i.e. half the number of the sporophyte. The gametophyte of ferns is a free-living organism, whereas the gametophyte of the gymnosperms and angiosperms is dependent on the sporophyte.

The life cycle of a typical fern proceeds as follows:
# A diploid sporophyte phase produces haploid spores by meiosis (a process of cell division which reduces the number of chromosomes by a half).
# A spore grows into a free-living haploid gametophyte by mitosis (a process of cell division which maintains the number of chromosomes). The gametophyte typically consists of a photosynthetic prothallus.
# The gametophyte produces gametes (often both sperm and eggs on the same prothallus) by mitosis.
# A mobile, flagellate sperm fertilizes an egg that remains attached to the prothallus.
# The fertilized egg is now a diploid zygote and grows by mitosis into a diploid sporophyte (the typical fern plant).

Sometimes a gametophyte can give rise to sporophyte traits like roots or sporangia without the rest of the sporophyte.

== Uses ==

Ferns are not as important economically as seed plants, but have considerable importance in some societies. Some ferns are used for food, including the fiddleheads of &quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot; (bracken), &quot;Matteuccia struthiopteris&quot; (ostrich fern), and &quot;Osmundastrum cinnamomeum&quot; (cinnamon fern). &quot;Diplazium esculentum&quot; is also used in the tropics (for example in &quot;budu pakis&quot;, a traditional dish of Brunei) as food. Tubers from the &quot;para&quot;, &quot;Ptisana salicina&quot; (king fern) are a traditional food in New Zealand and the South Pacific. Fern tubers were used for food 30,000 years ago in Europe. Fern tubers were used by the Guanches to make gofio in the Canary Islands. Ferns are generally not known to be poisonous to humans. Licorice fern rhizomes were chewed by the natives of the Pacific Northwest for their flavor. Some species of ferns are carcinogenic, and the British Royal Horticultural Society has advised not to consume any species for health reasons of both humans and livestock.

Ferns of the genus &quot;Azolla&quot;, commonly known as water fern or mosquito ferns are very small, floating plants that do not resemble ferns. The mosquito ferns are used as a biological fertilizer in the rice paddies of southeast Asia, taking advantage of their ability to fix nitrogen from the air into compounds that can then be used by other plants.

Ferns have proved resistant to phytophagous insects. The gene that express the protein Tma12 in an edible fern, &quot;Tectaria macrodonta&quot;, has been transferred to cotton plants, which became resistant to whitefly infestations.

Many ferns are grown in horticulture as landscape plants, for cut foliage and as houseplants, especially the Boston fern (&quot;Nephrolepis exaltata&quot;) and other members of the genus &quot;Nephrolepis&quot;. The bird&#x27;s nest fern (&quot;Asplenium nidus&quot;) is also popular, as are the staghorn ferns (genus &quot;Platycerium&quot;). Perennial (also known as hardy) ferns planted in gardens in the northern hemisphere also have a considerable following.

Several ferns, such as bracken and &quot;Azolla&quot; species are noxious weeds or invasive species. Further examples include Japanese climbing fern (&quot;Lygodium japonicum&quot;), sensitive fern (&quot;Onoclea sensibilis&quot;) and Giant water fern (&quot;Salvinia molesta&quot;), one of the world&#x27;s worst aquatic weeds. The important fossil fuel coal consists of the remains of primitive plants, including ferns.

== Culture ==

=== Pteridology ===

The study of ferns and other pteridophytes is called pteridology. A pteridologist is a specialist in the study of pteridophytes in a broader sense that includes the more distantly related lycophytes.

=== Pteridomania ===

Pteridomania was a Victorian era craze which involved fern collecting and fern motifs in decorative art including pottery, glass, metals, textiles, wood, printed paper, and sculpture &quot;appearing on everything from christening presents to gravestones and memorials.&quot; The fashion for growing ferns indoors led to the development of the Wardian case, a glazed cabinet that would exclude air pollutants and maintain the necessary humidity.

=== Other applications ===

The Barnsley fern is a fractal named after the British mathematician Michael Barnsley who first described it in his book &quot;Fractals Everywhere&quot;. A self-similar structure is described by a mathematical function, applied repeatedly at different scales to create a frond pattern.

The dried form of ferns was used in other arts, such as a stencil or directly inked for use in a design. The botanical work, &quot;The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;, is a notable example of this type of nature printing. The process, patented by the artist and publisher Henry Bradbury, impressed a specimen on to a soft lead plate. The first publication to demonstrate this was Alois Auer&#x27;s &quot;The Discovery of the Nature Printing-Process&quot;.

Fern bars were popular in America in the 1970s and 80s.

=== Folklore ===

Ferns figure in folklore, for example in legends about mythical flowers or seeds. In Slavic folklore, ferns are believed to bloom once a year, during the Ivan Kupala night. Although alleged to be exceedingly difficult to find, anyone who sees a fern flower is thought to be guaranteed to be happy and rich for the rest of their life. Similarly, Finnish tradition holds that one who finds the seed of a fern in bloom on Midsummer night will, by possession of it, be guided and be able to travel invisibly to the locations where eternally blazing Will o&#x27; the wisps called &quot;aarnivalkea&quot; mark the spot of hidden treasure. These spots are protected by a spell that prevents anyone but the fern-seed holder from ever knowing their locations. In Wicca, ferns are thought to have magical properties such as a dried fern can be thrown into hot coals of a fire to exorcise evil spirits, or smoke from a burning fern is thought to drive away snakes and such creatures.

=== New Zealand ===

Ferns are the national emblem of New Zealand and feature on its passport and in the design of its national airline, Air New Zealand, and of its rugby team, the All Blacks.

==Organisms confused with ferns==

=== Misnomers ===

Several non-fern plants (and even animals) are called ferns and are sometimes confused with ferns. These include:

* Asparagus fern—This may apply to one of several species of the monocot genus &quot;Asparagus&quot;, which are flowering plants.
* Sweetfern—A flowering shrub of the genus &quot;Comptonia&quot;.
* Air fern—A group of animals called hydrozoans that are distantly related to jellyfish and corals. They are harvested, dried, dyed green, and then sold as a plant that can live on air. While it may look like a fern, it is merely the skeleton of this colonial animal.
* Fern bush—&quot;Chamaebatiaria millefolium&quot;—a rose family shrub with fern-like leaves.
* Fern tree—&quot;Jacaranda mimosifolia&quot;—an ornamental tree of the order Lamiales.
* Fern leaf tree—&quot;Filicium decipiens&quot;—an ornamental tree of the order Sapindales.

=== Fern-like flowering plants ===

Some flowering plants such as palms and members of the carrot family have pinnate leaves that somewhat resemble fern fronds. However, these plants have fully developed seeds contained in fruits, rather than the microscopic spores of ferns.

<text>The Temple Mount and Israel Faithful Movement (), more commonly known simply as the Temple Mount Faithful (), is an extremist Orthodox Jewish movement, based in Jerusalem, whose goal is to rebuild the Third Jewish Temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and re-institute the practice of ritual sacrifice.

==History==
The movement was founded by former Israel Defense Forces officer and Middle Eastern studies lecturer Gershon Salomon. Members of the movement are referred to as the &quot;Temple Mount Faithful&quot;. The group was established in 1967.

On 8 October 1990, seventeen Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police in the 1990 Temple Mount riots triggered by an announcement by the Temple Mount Faithful that they were going to lay a cornerstone for a Third Jewish Temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. After the riots, the police prohibited Salomon from entering the Temple Mount; his appeal of that decision was subsequently denied by Israel&#x27;s High Court of Justice.

The Temple Mount Faithful was the first significant group to advocate the Jewish takeover of the Temple Mount, and during the 1970s and 1980s, it remained the most visible group with that position. Initially, the group presented its argument largely in terms of nationalistic, rather than religious, symbolism. In a 1983 interview, Salomon stated that &quot;whoever controls the Temple Mount has rights over the Land of Israel&quot;. Over time, Gershon Salomon developed a more religiously oriented apocalyptic and messianic platform, which, however, was distinctly non-Orthodox in character. Tensions with the more Orthodox elements in the group caused a formal split in 1987, when a more religiously-oriented splinter group, called the &quot;Movement for the Establishment of the Temple&quot;, was founded. Subsequently, the influence of the Temple Mount Faithful among the radical Jewish activists gradually waned, although the group still retains significant visibility.

==Organization operations==
The Temple Mount Faithful functions as a protest movement, but, unlike some other radical Jewish groups, it attempts to operate within Israeli law. Typically, shortly before major Jewish religious festivals, the group requests a permit from the Israeli police to enter the Temple Mount compound and conduct prayer services there. These requests are routinely denied, and are followed by petitions to Israel&#x27;s High Court of Justice. The High Court, also routinely, permits the group to enter the site, but not to pray there; and such permit is contingent on the Israeli police concluding that the security situation would allow such entry. The police conclude that the entry cannot be permitted for security reasons, and the Temple Mount Faithful are not allowed to enter the Temple Mount compound. As a result, their demonstrations usually proceed to the Mograbi Gate, and are stopped by the police there, outside of the compound.

In recent years, Salomon increasingly shifted the focus of the Temple Mount Faithful in the apocalyptic and messianic direction, and restoration of the Jewish Temple became one of the central objectives of the movement. During the same period, the movement developed close ties with Christian fundamentalist circles, and it receives significant financial assistance from some Christian groups, particularly in the United States.

==Death of Gershon Solomon==

On November 23, 2022, Gershon Salomon, founder of the Temple Mount Faithful, died. Although banned from the Temple Mount for many years, he was allowed to make one visit during the last year of his life.

<text>Field Marshal George Wade (1673 – 14 March 1748) was an Anglo-Irish British Army officer who served in the Nine Years&#x27; War, War of the Spanish Succession, Jacobite rising of 1715 and War of the Quadruple Alliance before leading the construction of barracks, bridges and proper roads in Scotland. He went on to be a military commander during the War of the Austrian Succession and Commander-in-Chief of the Forces during the Jacobite rising of 1745.

==Early career==
Born the son of Jerome Wade in Killavally, County Westmeath, Ireland, he spent his early years in English Tangier, where his father was a member of the Tangier Garrison. Wade was commissioned into the Earl of Bath&#x27;s Regiment on 26 December 1690 and served in Flanders in 1692, fighting at the Battle of Steenkerque in August 1692 during the Nine Years&#x27; War and earning a promotion to lieutenant on 10 February 1693. He transferred to Sir Bevil Granville&#x27;s Regiment on 19 April 1694 and was promoted to captain on 13 June 1695.

During the War of the Spanish Succession, he first served under Marlborough, seeing action in Flanders at the Battle of Kaiserwerth in April 1702, the Battle of Venlo in September 1702, the Battle of Roermond in October 1702 and the Battle of Liège also in October 1702. He was promoted to major on 20 March 1703 and to lieutenant colonel in October 1703. In 1704 he joined the staff of Henri de Massue, Earl of Galway as adjutant-general in Portugal, and distinguished himself as colonel of the Huntingdon&#x27;s Regiment during the Battle of Alcántara, where he was wounded in April 1706. He repelled a large force of cavalry at Vila Nova and then commanded the 3rd infantry brigade during the Battle of Almansa in April 1707. He was promoted to brigadier general on 1 January 1708.

He served as second in command to James Stanhope in Menorca in 1708, leading one of the storming parties on Fort St. Philip, before returning to Spain in 1710, where he fought at the Battle of Saragossa in August 1710. He was promoted to major-general on 3 October 1714 and became commander of the British forces in Ireland in November 1714.

Wade returned home to join in the suppression of the Jacobite rising of 1715 and undertook security duties in Bath, where he unearthed a haul of Jacobite weapons. He entered politics as MP for Hindon in 1715. On 19 March 1717, he became colonel of the Earl of Plymouth&#x27;s Regiment of Horse.

In 1719, he served as second-in-command to Viscount Cobham during the War of the Quadruple Alliance when Cobham led a force of 4,000 troops on a raid on the Spanish coastline which captured Vigo and occupied it for ten days before withdrawing. The same year he was one of the original backers of the Royal Academy of Music, establishing a London opera company that commissioned numerous works from Handel and others.

He became MP for Bath in 1722, retaining the seat for 25 years. His house, built around 1700, is situated next to Bath Abbey and is now a Grade I listed building.

==Scotland==

The government of George I sent Wade to inspect Scotland in 1724. He recommended the construction of barracks, bridges and proper roads to assist in the control of the country. On 10 May 1725, he was appointed &quot;Commander in Chief of His Majesty&#x27;s forces, castles, forts and barracks in North Britain&quot; and was tasked with carrying out his own recommendations. Over the next twelve years Wade directed the construction of some of roads and 30 bridges (including the Wade&#x27;s Bridge at Aberfeldy). General Wade&#x27;s military roads linked the garrisons at Ruthven, Fort George, Fort Augustus, and Fort William.

A reference in verse is said to be inscribed on a stone at the start of one of his military roads in Scotland:
Wade also organised a militia, &quot;Highland Watches&quot;, and called on members of the landed gentry to sign up and raised the first six companies in 1725 (three of Campbells and one each of Frasers, Grants, and Munros). Also in 1725, Wade put down an insurrection after the government attempted to extend the &quot;malt tax&quot; to Scotland, and enraged citizens in Glasgow drove out the military and destroyed the home of their representative in Parliament. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 15 April 1727.

On 1 June 1732, he became Governor of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and on 19 June 1733, he became Governor of Fort William, Fort George and Fort Augustus. He was promoted to general of horse on 17 July 1739.

He raised four more &quot;Highland Watch&quot; companies in 1739, which were subsequently reorganized as the Black Watch regiment. He still had the time to sign his support to the Foundling Hospital, which was established in 1739 in London. On 22 June 1742, he was appointed Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, and on 24 June 1742, he was appointed a member of the Privy Council.

==War of the Austrian Succession==
On 17 December 1743 he became a field marshal with his appointment to the joint command of the Anglo-Austrian force in Flanders against the French in the War of the Austrian Succession. Wade organised an advance towards Lille in July 1744, but the action became stalled in the face of logistical problems. He resigned from his command in March 1745 and returned home to become Commander-in-Chief of the Forces.

==Jacobite rising==
In October 1745, during the Jacobite rising, Wade concentrated his troops in Newcastle upon Tyne, on the east coast of England; however, the Jacobite forces advanced from Scotland down the west coast of England via Carlisle into Lancashire and the speed of their advance left Wade scrambling. In freezing conditions and with his men starving, he failed to counter their march into England or their subsequent retreat back from Derby to Scotland. Wade was replaced as Commander-in-Chief by Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, who led the army to success at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746.

It was because of the difficulties Wade encountered marching his troops cross-country from Newcastle to Carlisle that he built his Military Road west of Newcastle in 1746, entailing such destruction of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Wade helped plan the road but had died before construction began in 1751. His Military Road is still in use today as the B6318; it should not be confused with the Military Way built by the Romans immediately south of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

Wade received mention in a verse sung as part of God Save the King around 1745:

== Family life ==
Wade died unmarried on 14 March 1748 and is buried at Westminster Abbey, where his life is recognised by a monument created by Louis-François Roubiliac.

Wade left two natural (illegitimate) sons, Captains William and John Wade, and two natural daughters, Jane Erle and Emilia. Wade left most of his estate to his natural children although he provided generously for the widow and children of his brother William, Canon of Windsor, Berkshire. Wade had a second natural daughter named Emilia, who was married first in 1728 to a Mr John Mason and then to a Mr Jebb.

<text>Yekaterinburg ( ; ), alternatively romanized as Ekaterinburg and formerly known as Sverdlovsk (Russian: Свердловск ; 1924–1991), is a city and the administrative centre of Sverdlovsk Oblast and the Ural Federal District, Russia. The city is located on the Iset River between the Volga-Ural region and Siberia, with a population of roughly 1.5 million residents, up to 2.2 million residents in the urban agglomeration. Yekaterinburg is the fourth-largest city in Russia, the largest city in the Ural Federal District, and one of Russia&#x27;s main cultural and industrial centres. Yekaterinburg has been dubbed the &quot;Third capital of Russia&quot;, as it is ranked third by the size of its economy, culture, transportation and tourism.

Yekaterinburg was founded on 18 November 1723 and named after the Orthodox name of Catherine I (born Marta Helena Skowrońska), the wife of Russian Emperor Peter the Great. The city served as the mining capital of the Russian Empire as well as a strategic connection between Europe and Asia. In 1781, Catherine the Great gave Yekaterinburg the status of a district town of Perm Province, and built the historical Siberian Route through the city. Yekaterinburg became a key city to Siberia, which had rich resources. In the late 19th century, Yekaterinburg became one of the centres of revolutionary movements in the Urals. In 1924, after the Russian SFSR founded the Soviet Union, the city was renamed &quot;Sverdlovsk&quot; after the Bolshevik leader Yakov Sverdlov. During the Soviet era, Sverdlovsk was turned into an industrial and administrative powerhouse. On 23 September 1991 the city returned to its historical name.

Yekaterinburg is one of Russia&#x27;s most important economic centres and was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The city is currently experiencing an economic and population boom, which resulted in some of the tallest skyscrapers of Russia being located in the city. Yekaterinburg is home to the headquarters of the Central Military District of the Russian Armed Forces, as well as the presidium of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Yekaterinburg is famous for its constructivist architecture and is also considered the &quot;Russian capital of street art&quot;.

==History==
=== Prehistory ===

The area was settled in prehistory. The earliest settlements date to 8000–7000 BC, in the Mesolithic period. The Isetskoe Pravoberezhnoye I archaeological site contains a Neolithic settlement dated to 6000–5000 BC. It includes stone processing workshops with artefacts such as grinding plates, anvils, clumps of rock, tools, and finished products. Over 50 different types of rock and minerals were used in tool making, indicating extensive knowledge of the region&#x27;s natural resources. The Gamayun peninsula (left bank of the Verkh-Isetsky Pond) has archaeological findings from the Chalcolithic Period: workshops for producing stone tools (upper area) and two dwellings of the Ayat culture (lower area). There are also traces of the Koptyak culture from 2000 BC: dishes decorated with bird images and evidence of metallurgical production. The Tent I site contains the only Koptyak culture burials discovered in the Ural Mountains. In the Bronze Age, the people of Gamayun culture lived in the area. They left fragments of ceramics, weapons, and ornaments.

Archaeological artifacts in the vicinity of Yekaterinburg were first discovered during railway construction, at the end of the 19th century. Excavation and research began in the 20th century. Artifacts are held at the Sverdlovsk Regional Museum of Local Lore, at the Hermitage, at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences, and at other museums.

===Imperial era===
The first Russian settlements within the boundaries of modern Yekaterinburg appeared in the second half of the 17th century — in 1672, an Old Believers village arose in the area of Shartash lake (this fact is disputed by historians, since no evidence of the founding of the village at that time was found in the sources), and in 1680–1682, the villages of Nizhny and Verkhny Uktus appeared on the banks of Uktus River (now the territory of the Chkalovsky district of the city). In 1702, by the initiative of the head of Sibirskiy prikaz Andrew Vinius, the Uktus state ironwork plant was founded near Nizhny Uktus — the first ironworks within the boundaries of modern Yekaterinburg. In 1704, the Shuvakish ironworks was built (now the territory of the Zheleznodorozhny district of the city). With the beginning of active construction of factories in the Urals in the 18th century, relations with their southern neighbors, the Bashkirs, became strained. As a result of the Bashkir raid in 1709, the village of Verkhny Uktus was devastated, all buildings, including the wooden church and chapel, were burned, the residents fled to the protection of the Uktus plant fortifications. On the night of 5 April 1718, a fire destroyed all the factory buildings of the Uktus plant, except for the dam, and the plant was restored only by 1720 under the supervision of Timofey Burtsev. However, the plant did not receive further development due to the lack of water in Uktus river.

In 1720, by decree of Peter I, a delegation led by mining specialist Johann Blüher and statesman Vasily Tatishchev was sent to the Urals. They were entrusted with managing the mining industry, identifying the causes of the collapse and reduction of production at state-owned factories. On 29 December 1720, Tatishchev and Blüher arrive at the Uktus plant, which became their main residence in the Urals. As a result of familiarizing himself with the state of nearby state-owned factories, Tatishchev came to the conclusion that on the basis of these factories, even if they were reconstructed and expanded, it would not be possible to quickly increase the production of iron, and it would be more profitable to build a new large plant. After inspecting the immediate area, together with the commissary of the Uktus plant, Timofey Burtsev, a place rich in ore and forest was chosen on the banks of the more full-flowing Iset River, 7 versts from Uktus. On 6 February 1721, Tatishchev sent a message to the Collegium of Mining, in which he asked permission to begin construction of the plant, with detailed explanations and justification for this project. On 1 March 1721, without waiting for a response from the Collegium, Tatishchev began construction of the new plant, but he failed to convince Collegium, and by the Collegium decree of 10 December 1721, he was removed from the leadership of mining affairs in the Urals. In 1722, by decree of Peter the Great, a mining engineer, Major General Georg Wilhelm de Gennin, was sent to the Urals in place of Tatishchev. Having studied all the circumstances, de Gennin fully supported Tatishchev’s project, and on 12 March 1723, construction of the plant on Iset resumed.

Russian historian Vasily Tatishchev and Russian engineer Georg Wilhelm de Gennin founded Yekaterinburg with the construction of a massive iron-making plant under the decree of Russian emperor Peter the Great in 1723. They named the city after the emperor&#x27;s wife, Yekaterina, who later became empress regnant Catherine I. Officially, the city&#x27;s founding date is 18 November 1723, when the shops carried out a test run of the bloomery for trip hammers. The plant was commissioned 6 days later, on 24 November. 1723 also saw the establishment of Yekaterinburg fortress, which would encompass many of the settlement&#x27;s earliest buildings. Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak very vividly described the beginning of the construction of a mining plant and a fortress: &quot;Imagine completely deserted banks of the Iset river, covered with forest. In the spring of 1723, soldiers from Tobolsk, peasants of the assigned settlements, hired craftsmen appeared, and everything around came to life, as if by the dictates of a fairy tale. They dropped the forest, prepared a place for the dam, laid blast furnaces, raised the rampart, set up barracks and houses for the authorities... &quot;.

In 1722–1726 the Verkhne-Uktussky mining plant was built, which was officially called the plant of the princess Elizabeth (the future village of Elizabeth, or Elizavetinskoe) and became a part of modern Yekaterinburg in 1934. In 1726, Wilhelm de Gennin founded an auxiliary Verkh-Isetsky plant with a working settlement 2 versts from Yekaterinburg upstream (&#x27;verkh&#x27; in Russian) the Iset River. The plant&#x27;s dam formed the Verkh-Isetsky pond. Colloquially called by the Russian acronym VIZ, it was a satellite town until in 1926, with a population of over 20,000 people by this time, it was incorporated into Yekaterinburg as the core of the Verkh-Isetsky district.

Yekaterinburg was one of the industrial cities of Russia prompted at the beginning of the 18th century by decrees of Tsar Peter the Great which demanded the development of the metalworking industry. With extensive use of iron, the city was built to a regular square plan with ironworks and residential buildings at the centre. These were surrounded by fortified walls so that Yekaterinburg was at the same time both a manufacturing centre and a fortress at the frontier between Europe and Asia. It, therefore, found itself at the heart of Russia&#x27;s strategy for further development of the entire Ural region. The so-called Siberian Route became operational in 1763 and placed the city on an increasingly important transit route, which led to its development as a focus of trade and commerce between east and west, and gave rise to the description of the city as the &quot;window to Asia&quot;. With the growth in trade and the city&#x27;s administrative importance, the ironworks became less critical, and the more important buildings were increasingly built using expensive stone. Small manufacturing and trading businesses proliferated. In 1781 Russia&#x27;s empress, Catherine the Great, granted Yekaterinburg town status and nominated it as the administrative centre for the wider region within Perm Governorate. In 1807, the role of the capital of the mining and smelting region was confirmed by assigning it the status of the only &quot;mountain city&quot; in Russia. Until 1863, Yekaterinburg remained subordinate to the head of the mining plants of the Ural ridge, the minister of finance and personally to the emperor, and enjoyed considerable freedom from the governor&#x27;s power. Since the 1830s, mountainous Yekaterinburg has become the center of mechanical engineering. 
In 1820–1845, 45% of the world&#x27;s gold was mined in Yekaterinburg. This is the first ever &quot;Gold Rush&quot;. Until 1876, 80% of the coins in circulation in the Russian Empire were produced at the Yekaterinburg mint.

Following the October Revolution, the family of deposed Tsar Nicholas II was sent to internal exile in Yekaterinburg where they were imprisoned in the Ipatiev House in the city. In July 1918, the Czechoslovak Legions were closing on Yekaterinburg. In the early hours of the morning of 17 July, the deposed Tsar, his wife Alexandra, and their children Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia, and Tsarevich Alexei were murdered by the Bolsheviks at the Ipatiev House. Other members of the Romanov family were killed at Alapayevsk later the same day. The Legions arrived less than a week later and captured the city. The city remained under the control of the White movement in which a provisional government was established. The Red Army took back the city and restored Soviet authority on 14 July 1919.

===Soviet era===

In the years following the Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War, political authority of the Urals was transferred from Perm to Yekaterinburg. On 19 October 1920, Yekaterinburg established its first university, the Ural State University, as well as polytechnic, pedagogical, and medical institutions under the decree of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin. Enterprises in the city ravaged by the war were nationalised, including: the Metalist (formerly Yates) Plant, the Verkh-Isetsky (formerly Yakovleva) Plant, and the Lenin flax-spinning factory (formerly Makarov). In 1924, the city of Yekaterinburg was renamed Sverdlovsk after the Bolshevik leader Yakov Sverdlov.

By the 1934, following a series of administrative reforms carried by the early Soviet government, the earliest Russian settlements which predated Yekaterinburg and laid the basis of its founding, were incorporated into the city proper.

During the reign of Stalin, Sverdlovsk was one of several places developed by the Soviet government as a centre of heavy industry. Old factories were reconstructed and new large factories were built, especially those specialised in machine-building and metalworking. These plants included Magnitogorsk and the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant in Chelyabinsk oblast, and Uralmash in Sverdlovsk. During this time, the population of Sverdlovsk tripled in size, and it became one of the fastest-growing cities of the Soviet Union. At that time, very large powers were given to the regional authorities. By the end of the 1930s, there were 140 industrial enterprises, 25 research institutes, and 12 higher education institutions in Sverdlovsk.

During World War II, the city became the headquarters of the Ural Military District on the basis of which more than 500 different military units and formations were formed, including the 22nd Army and the Ural Volunteer Tank Corps. Uralmash became the main production site for armoured vehicles. Many state technical institutions and whole factories were relocated to Sverdlovsk away from cities affected by war (mostly Moscow), with many of them staying in Sverdlovsk after the victory. The Hermitage Museum collections were also partly evacuated from Leningrad to Sverdlovsk in July 1941 and remained there until October 1945. In the postwar years, new industrial and agricultural enterprises were put into operation and massive housing construction began. The lookalike five-story apartment blocks that remain today in Kirovsky, Chkalovsky, and other residential areas of Sverdlovsk sprang up in the 1960s, under the direction of Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s government. In 1977, Ipatiev House was demolished by order of Boris Yeltsin in accordance to a resolution from the Politburo in order to prevent it from being used as a rallying location for monarchists. Yeltsin later became the first President of Russia and represented the people at the funeral of the former Tsar in 1998. There was an anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk in April and May 1979, which was attributed to a release from the Sverdlovsk-19 military facility.

===Contemporary era===
During the 1991 coup d&#x27;état attempt, Sverdlovsk, the home city of President Boris Yeltsin, was selected by him as a temporary reserve capital for the Russian Federation, in case Moscow became too dangerous for the Russian government. A reserve cabinet headed by Oleg Lobov was sent to the city, where Yeltsin enjoyed strong popular support at that time. Shortly after the failure of the coup and subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union, the city regained its historical name of Yekaterinburg on 23 September 1991. However, Sverdlovsk Oblast, of which Yekaterinburg is the administrative centre, kept its name.

In the 2000s, an intensive growth of trade, business, and tourism began in Yekaterinburg. In 2003, Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder negotiated in Yekaterinburg. On 15–17 June 2009, the SCO and BRIC summits were held in Yekaterinburg, which greatly improved the economic, cultural, and tourist situation in the city. On 13–16 July 2010, a meeting between Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and German Chancellor Angela Merkel took place in the city.

In 2018, Yekaterinburg hosted four matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup and hosted the inaugural University International Sports Festival in 2023.

==Geography==
===Location===

Geographically, Yekaterinburg is in North Asia, close to the Ural Mountains (which divide Europe from Asia), east of the nation&#x27;s capital Moscow.

The city has a total area of .

Yekaterinburg is on the eastern side of the Urals. The city is surrounded by wooded hills, partially cultivated for agricultural purposes. Yekaterinburg is located on a natural watershed, so there would be many bodies of water close and in the city. The city is bisected by the Iset River, which flows from the Urals into the Tobol River. There are two lakes in the city, Lake Shuvakish and Lake Shartash. The city borders Verkh-Isetskiy Pond, through which the Iset River flows. Lake Isetskoye and Lake Baltym are both near the city, with Lake Isetskoye located near Sredneuralsk, and Lake Baltym located near the towns of Sanatornyy and Baltym.

===Time===
Yekaterinburg uses Yekaterinburg Time, which is five hours ahead of UTC (UTC+5), and two hours ahead of Moscow Time.

===Climate===
The city possesses a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification. It is characterised by sharp variability in weather conditions, with well-marked seasons. The Ural Mountains, despite their insignificant height, block air from the west, from the European part of Russia. As a result, the Central Urals are open to the invasion of cold arctic air and continental air from the West Siberian Plain. Equally, warm air masses from the Caspian Sea and the deserts of Central Asia can freely penetrate from the south. Therefore, the weather in Yekaterinburg is characterised by sharp temperature fluctuations and weather anomalies: in winter, from frost at −40 °C to thaw and rain; in summer, from frosts to temperatures above .

The distribution of precipitation is determined by the circulation of air masses, relief, and air temperatures. The main part of the precipitation is brought by cyclones with a western air mass transfer, that is, from the European part of Russia, while their average annual amount is 601 mm. The maximum falls on a warm season, during which about 60–70% of the annual amount falls. For the winter period is characterized by snow cover with an average capacity of 40–50 cm. The coefficient of moistening(the ratio of yearly precipitation and potential evaporation) – 1.
* The average temperature in January is . The record minimum temperature is (6 January 1915);
* The average July temperature is . The record maximum temperature is (11 July 2023);
* The average annual temperature is ;
* The average annual wind speed is ;
* The average annual humidity is 75%;
* The average annual precipitation is ;

==Demographics==
===Population===
According to the results of the 2021 Census, the population of Yekaterinburg was 1,544,376; up from 1,349,772 recorded in the 2010 Census.

 the ethnic composition of Yekaterinburg was:
===Religion===
Christianity is the predominant religion in the city, of which most are adherents to the Russian Orthodox Church. The Yekaterinburg and Verkhotursky diocese is located in the Holy Trinity Cathedral in the city. Other religions practised in Yekaterinburg include Islam, Old Believers, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Judaism.

Yekaterinburg has a significant Muslim community, but it suffers from a lack of worship space: there are only two small mosques. Another mosque was built in the nearby city of Verkhnyaya Pyshma. On 24 November 2007, the first stone was laid in the construction of a large Cathedral Mosque with four minarets, and space for 2,500 parishioners in the immediate vicinity of the cathedral and a synagogue, thus forming the &quot;area of the three religions&quot;. The mosque was planned to be built for the SCO summit, but due to funding problems, construction did not move from zero and is now frozen.

Construction of a Methodist church started in 1992, and with the help of American donations, finished in 2001. A synagogue was opened in 2005, on the same place a 19th-century synagogue was demolished in 1962.

Most of the city&#x27;s religious buildings were destroyed during the Soviet era, in addition to the synagogue, the three largest Orthodox churches in Yekaterinburg were demolished – the Epiphany Cathedral, the Ekaterininsky Cathedral, and the Great Zlatoust Church.

==Economy==
===Overview===
Yekaterinburg is one of the largest economic centres in Russia. It is included in the City-600 list (it unites the 600 largest cities in the world that produce 60% of global GDP), compiled by the McKinsey Global Institute, a research organisation. In 2010, the consulting company estimated the gross product of Yekaterinburg to be about $19 billion (according to the calculations of the company, it should grow to $40 billion by 2025).

By volume of the economy, Yekaterinburg ranks third in the country, after Moscow and St. Petersburg. According to a research of the Institute for Urban Economics, in the ranking of the largest cities and regional capital cities according to economic standards for 2015, Yekaterinburg ranked third. The city&#x27;s gross urban product (GVP) was 898 billion rubles. Per capita GDP was 621.0 thousand rubles (18th place). In 2015, the gross urban product of the Yekaterinburg metropolitan area amounted to 50.7 billion international dollars (the fourth place in the country) or 25.4 thousand international dollars in terms of per inhabitant of the metropolitan area.

In the Soviet era, Yekaterinburg (as Sverdlovsk) was a purely industrial city, with a share of industry in the economy of 90% (of which 90% were in defense production). With Chelyabinsk and Perm, the three cities formed what to be the Urals industrial hub.

The former head of Yekaterinburg, Arkady Chernetsky, has set the goal of diversifying the city&#x27;s economy, which has resulted in the development of sectors such as warehousing, transportation, logistics, telecommunications, financial sector, wholesale and retail trade, etc. in Yekaterinburg. Economist-geographer Natalia Zubarevich points out that at the present stage, Yekaterinburg has practically lost its industrial specialisation.

===Living costs and the labor market===
The standard of living in Yekaterinburg exceeds the average standard across Russia. According to the Department of Sociology of the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, it is among the top ten cities with the highest standard of living. Compared to other Russian cities with a population of around or over one million, in 2015, Yekaterinburg held a leading position in terms of average monthly wages and retail turnover, in terms of the total volume of investments in fourth place of fixed assets, and second place in housing placement.

The average monthly wage in Yekaterinburg following the results of 2019 was 54,976 rubles. This is the first place among the millionth municipalities of the Russian Federation. There are on average 440,300 people employed by large and middle-sized organisations and companies. The unemployment rate at the end of 2015 was 0.83% of the total economically active population. Locals labelled the main problems of the city such the current state of the healthcare system, housing system, and transportation system.

The budget of Yekaterinburg in 2015 was executed on income in the amount of 32,063.6 million rubles, for expenses in the amount of 32,745.8 million rubles. Among the budget expenditures: 17 billion rubles were spent on education, over 1 billion rubles on culture, and about 900 million rubles on health. The main part of the revenue of the city treasury was its own tax and non-tax revenues (more than 18 billion rubles). The revenues from the regional and federal budgets were at the lowest level in 10 years. Specialists noted a decrease in tax revenues and an increase in tax debt (exceeded 2 billion rubles).

The main budget expenditures are the development of the economy (which accounts for 19% of expenditures) and the social security of the townspeople (11% of expenditures go). Cities such as Perm, Kazan and Ufa, spend for these purposes in a smaller percentage of costs (from 2 to 6%). Also, a fairly strict budgetary discipline is noted—the budget deficit is kept at the level of 2% of its volume.

=== Finance and business ===
Yekaterinburg is one of the largest financial and business centres in Russia, with offices of multinational corporations, representative offices of foreign companies, and a large number of federal and regional financial and credit organisations. The financial market of Yekaterinburg is characterised by stability and independence, based both on the broad presence of large foreign and Moscow credit organisations and on the availability of large and stable local financial holdings.

The financial sector of Yekaterinburg has more than 100 banks, including 11 foreign banks. The list of the largest Russian banks for assets for 2016 included 10 banks registered in Yekaterinburg, including but not all: Ural Bank for Reconstruction and Development, SKB-Bank, Uraltransbank, and UM Bank.

Since 7 August 2017, by order of the Bank of Russia, the branches of the Siberian, Far Eastern and part of the Prevolzhsky Federal Districts have been transferred to the control of the Ural Megaregal Directorate. Thus, this is one of the three main departments of the Mega-regulator in the territory of Russia.

A major role in the formation of Yekaterinburg as a business centre has its infrastructural potential, which is growing at a high rate: transport accessibility for Russian and foreign economic entities, the availability of hotels, advanced communication services, business related services (consulting, exhibition activities, etc.). Yekaterinburg has its own central business district, Yekaterinburg City.

===Industry===

Yekaterinburg has been a major industrial centre since its foundation. In the 18th century, the main branches were smelting and processing of metal. Since the beginning of the 19th century, machine building appeared, and in the second half of the 19th century, light and food (especially milling) industry was widely spread. A new stage in the development of production occurred during the period of industrialisation – at this time in the city, factories were built, which determined the industry specialisation of heavy engineering. During World War II, Yekaterinburg (as Sverdlovsk) hosted about sixty enterprises evacuated from Central Russia and Ukraine. As a result, there was a sharp increase in the production capacity of existing plants and the emergence of new branches of the Urals industry.

At present, more than 220 large and medium-sized enterprises are registered in Yekaterinburg, 197 of them in manufacturing industries. In 2015, they shipped 323,288 million rubles worth of own-produced goods.

=== Tourism ===

In 2015, the city was one of the top five most visited Russian cities (others being Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, and Vladivostok) according to the Global Destinations Cities Index, which represents the payment system Mastercard. In recent years, a lot of work has been done to create a positive image of Yekaterinburg as a centre for international tourism, including holding of summits for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in 2008 and 2009 and the international exhibition Innoprom in 2009 and 2010. In 2014, Yekaterinburg ranked third among Russian cities in popularity among foreign tourists after Moscow and St. Petersburg.

In 2015, the total flow of inbound tourism grew by 10% compared to the previous year and amounted to 2.1 million people. In recent years, there has been a tendency to reduce the role of business tourism in the overall flow: if in 2013 about 80% of trips were business, in 2015 their number was already 67%. Most tourists go to &quot;bow to the memory of the last [czar] and his family.&quot; In addition, new tourist ideas are developing such as the Bazhov theme, the geological and mineralogical theme, industrial tourism, and the event calendar.

==Transportation==
Yekaterinburg is the third largest transport hub of Russia, behind Moscow and St. Petersburg. The city has 6 federal highways, 7 main railway lines, and an international airport. The location of Yekaterinburg in the central part of the region allows for 7 to 10 hours to get from it to any large city of the Urals. The formation of Yekaterinburg as an important transportation hub is largely due to the city&#x27;s favourable geographical location on a low stretch of the Ural Mountains, through which it was convenient to lay the main roads connecting the European and Eastern parts of Russia.

===Roads===

Yekaterinburg is one of the ten Russian megacities with the largest car fleet (0.437 megacars were registered in the city in 2014), which has been intensively increasing in recent years (by 6–14% annually). The level of car ownership in 2015 has reached 410 cars per 1,000 people. Its pace in the past few years has seriously exceeded the pace of development and the capacity of the road infrastructure. For the first time, transport problems started to appear in Yekaterinburg in the 1980s and though it did not seem threatening at first, the situation gets worse every year. Studies have shown that as early as 2005, the capacity limit for the road network was reached, which has now led to permanent congestion. To increase the capacity of the street-road network, stage-by-stage reconstruction of streets is being carried out, as well as multi-level interchanges being built. In order to reduce the transit traffic, the Sverdlovsk Oblast administration announced two road projects in 2014: the Yekaterinburg Ring Road (EKAD) and an overpass road on Sovetskaya Street. The Yekaterinburg Ring Road would surround the largest municipalities of Yekaterinburg. Its purpose would be to help the city&#x27;s economy and reduce traffic on the Middle Ring Road of the city, making it easier for civilians to commute around the city than going through the city&#x27;s traffic congestion. Eventually, the Ring Road would connect to other federal roads in order for easier access between other Russian cities. Construction of the road started in the same year. The projects were assigned to the Ministry of Transport and Communications since the projects were crucial to the city&#x27;s economy. Officials hope the road projects will build environments more conducive to improving local quality of life and outside investments. Completing these major inter-regional roads will increase productive traffic by 50% to 100%, improving the local economy with its ease of access to industries.

Since 2014, the project for the introduction of paid parking in the central part of Yekaterinburg is being implemented. The project is implemented in parallel with the increase in the number of intercepting parking lots and the construction of parking lots. At the end of 2015, in the central part of the city there were 2,307 paid parking places.

The total length of the road network in Yekaterinburg is , of which is cobbled carriageways, is with upgraded coverage, is backbone networks, of which are on the citywide backbone network movement. 20 interchanges have been constructed at different levels within the city limits, including 11 on the EKAD and 9 on the middle ring. 74 transport facilities (27 bridges across the Iset River, Patrushikha, Mostovka, Istok Rivers, 13 dams on the Iset, Patrushikha, Istok, Olkhovka, Warm, Shilovka Rivers, 23 road overpasses, and 18 out-of-the-way pedestrian crossings) were built as well.

Yekaterinburg is served by the following highways:

* M5
* E22
* R351
* R352
* R354
* R355

===Public transit===
Yekaterinburg uses almost all types of public transport. The largest transportation services—the Municipal Association of Bus Enterprises, the Tram-Trolleybus Office, and the Yekaterinburg Metro —transported 207.4 million people in 2015. The total volume of passenger transportation by all land transport modes decreases annually. If the annual passenger traffic of municipal transport was 647.1 million people in 2002, and according to this index the city occupied the third place in the country with a wide margin, then in 2008 this figure would be 412 million people (the fourth place in Russia).

Since 1991, the city operates the sixth metro in Russia and the thirteenth in the CIS. At the moment there is one line with 9 stations. In 2015 49.9 million passengers were transported; according to this metric the Yekaterinburg Metro is the fourth in Russia, behind the Moscow Metro, Saint Petersburg Metro, and Novosibirsk Metro. Although the metro is the second most popular type of public transport, in recent years significant problems have appeared in its work: loss-making, obsolete rolling stock, and a shortage of funds for modernisation. The tram network was established in 1929 and currently plays a leading role in the urban transport system. The volume of passengers carried for 2013 is 127.8 million, but this declines every year (245 million people in 2013). In 2016 there were 30 routes operating 459 cars. The total length of the tracks is 185.5 km. , the construction of a tram line &quot;Yekaterinburg-Verkhnyaya Pyshma&quot; was planned.

There are 93 bus routes operating in Yekaterinburg, including 30 municipal ones (EMUP &quot;MOAP&quot;). In 2007, 114.5 million passengers were transported by municipal intercity buses (124.6 million in 2006). The decrease in volume is due to the increasing role of the fixed-route taxis in the urban transport system of Yekaterinburg, as well as the high cost of travel. However, the city bus transport network provides significant employment for the people of Yekaterinburg, including the formidable babushkas who collect passenger fares. In the park of EMPU, there are 537 buses. In 2013, there are 19 routes, which employ 250 trolleybuses. The total length of trolleybus lines is 168.4 km. The number of passengers transported by trolleybus in 2007 amounted to 78.4 million (84.3 million in 2006).

The influence of theatrical life of the city was made by the Moscow Art Academic Theater and the Central Theater of the Soviet Army when they evacuated to Yekaterinburg (as Sverdlovsk) during World War II, and they had their own theater in the city. Notable theatres that operate in the city are Academic Theater of Musical Comedy, Drama Theater, Kolyada-Theater, the youth theatre, and the puppet theatre, as well as others.

A number of popular Russian rock bands, such as Urfin Dzhyus, Chaif, Chicherina, Nautilus Pompilius, Nastya, Trek, Agata Kristi, Slaughter to Prevail and Smyslovye Gallyutsinatsii, were originally formed in Yekaterinburg (&quot;Ural Rock&quot; is often considered as a particular variety of rock music. Yekaterinburg and St. Petersburg are actually considered to be the main centres of the genre in Russia). Also, opera singers like Boris Shtokolov, Yuri Gulyayev, Vera Bayeva graduated from the Urals State Conservatory. The Ural Philharmonic Orchestra (currently conducted by Dmitry Liss), founded by Mark Paverman and located in Yekaterinburg, is also very popular in Russia and in Europe, as well as the Ural Academic Popular Chorus, a folk-singing and dance ensemble.

=== Architecture ===
Many buildings of Yekaterinburg are ranged from a different number of architectural styles. The city had a regular layout, based on the fortresses of the Renaissance and by the principles of French town planning during the 17th century. By the 18th century, the Baroque movement was not that influential in Yekaterinburg, with the style being seen in churches which later declined

In the first half of the 19th century, neoclassicism grew influential in the Yekaterinburg&#x27;s architecture. The estates were built in the neoclassic style, including the main house, wings, services, and often an English-style park. This style&#x27;s influence in Yekaterinburg is mostly due to the contributions of architect Michael Malakhov, who worked in the city from 1815 to 1842. He designed the assemblies of the Verkhne-Isetsky factory as well as the Novo-Tikhvinsky Monastery.

At the beginning of the 20th century, eclecticism became a dominant influence in Yekaterinburg&#x27;s architecture. Buildings such as the Opera House and Yekaterinburg railway station were built in this style. During the 1920s and the 1930s, constructivism took effect, influencing residential complexes, industrial buildings, stadiums, etc. Architects Moses Ginzburg, Jacob Kornfeld, the Vesnina brothers, Daniel Friedman, and Sigismund Dombrovsky contributed greatly to the constructivism in the city. More than 140 structures in Yekaterinburg are designed in the constructivist style, including the Uralmash White Tower and the building of the printing house of the &quot;Uralskiy Rabochiy&quot; publishing house.
During the 1930s to 1950s, there was a turn back to neoclassicism, with much attention paid to public buildings and monuments. Notable examples include the buildings of the Ural Industrial Institute on Lenin Avenue, the City Party Committee and the City Council Executive Committee building (now the City Administrative building), the District Officers&#x27; House, and the House of Defense complex. Cultural buildings are built in the squares in orderly composition. In these years, architects Golubev, K. T. Babykin, Valenkov worked fruitfully in Yekaterinburg with this style. In the 1960s, changes in the approach to construction led to widespread distribution of apartment blocks common in the Khrushchev era. Buildings built by individuals were rare, among them being: KKT &quot;Kosmos&quot;, the Palace of Youth, and DK UZTM.

From the 1960s to the 1980s, as industrial development grew in Yekaterinburg, so did rationalism. The situation changed in the 1990s when Russia transferred into a market economy. At that time, older buildings were restored, giving the urban area a new environment such as: the Cosmos Concert Hall, the Puppet Theater, the children&#x27;s ballet theatre The Nutcracker, the Palace of Justice, the Cathedral of the Blood, and the Church of the Transfiguration. At the same time, the construction of new buildings was accompanied by the demolition of historical buildings, leading to the development of the &quot;facade&quot; phenomenon, where the facades of historic buildings are preserved while adjacent modern buildings are built.

The centre of Yekaterinburg became the centre of new construction, where banks, business centres, hotels, luxury residential complexes, and sports and shopping centres were built. High-tech architecture grew influential, with buildings such as the Center for Railway Transportation Management, the Summit business centre, the Aquamarine residential complex, and the retail strip at Vaynera Street being notable examples. Along with this, postmodernism revived interest in the older architectural styles of Yekaterinburg, growing more emphasis on historicalism and contextualism. In the late 1990s, architects grew interested in regionalism.

At the beginning of the 21st century, Yekaterinburg architects turned back to the Soviet-based avant-garde, and influence future city buildings with the neoconstructivist style. The practice of attracting large foreign investors to projects has become popular. In 2007, the construction of the Central business district started, being headed by the French architect Jean Pistre. In 2010, Yekaterinburg became one of the largest centers for the construction of High-rise buildings. In the city, 1,189 high-rise buildings were built, including 20 skyscrapers, the tallest of which is the Iset Tower, with a height of 209 meters.

===Sports===
Yekaterinburg is also a leading sports centre in Russia. A large number of well-known athletes, both world and Olympics champions, are associated with the city.

In the 2008 Summer Olympics, 8 residents of Yekaterinburg returned with medals (1 gold, 3 silver and 4 bronze).
In 1965, Yekaterinburg (as Sverdlovsk), along with a number of Russian cities, hosted the Bandy World Championship. In 2018, Yekaterinburg was one of the 11 Russian cities that hosted the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The matches were played on the upgraded Yekaterinburg Arena (called Central Stadium before the World Cup).

==== 2018 FIFA World Cup ====

Yekaterinburg hosted four matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Yekaterinburg is one of the 11 Russian cities that hosted the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The matches were played on the upgraded Yekaterinburg Arena.

For the World Cup 2018, from 7 October 2015 to 29 December 2017, the Central Stadium was upgraded to bring it into compliance with FIFA requirements for the World Cup and was renamed Yekaterinburg Arena. The architectural concept of the new stadium is built on a combination of historical walls and the built-in core of the modern arena. During the reconstruction of the sports facility, which is a monument of history and culture, the facades are carefully preserved, and the arena itself is equipped with the latest technical achievements of the sports industry. Temporary stands extending outside the stadium&#x27;s original perimeter were erected to comply with the FIFA requirement of seating for 35,000 spectators. They can hold a total of 12,000 spectators, but the seating will be removed after the World Cup, decreasing the seating capacity back to 23,000.

The FIFA Fan Fest in Yekaterinburg is located in the Mayakovsky Central Park of Entertainment and Culture. Located just outside the city centre in a popular and well-known amusement park, it will have a capacity to hold 17,000 people.
