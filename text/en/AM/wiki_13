<text>Robin Givens (born November 27, 1964) is an American actress and director. Givens played Darlene Merriman in the ABC sitcom &quot;Head of the Class&quot; in 1986, and remained on the series for its five year duration. Her troubled marriage to boxer Mike Tyson in 1988 drew considerable media attention, as did their acrimonious divorce. She later went on to become a spokesperson for the National Domestic Violence Hotline for several years.

Givens continued her career with film and television roles such as &quot;The Women of Brewster Place&quot; (1989) and &quot;Boomerang&quot; (1992). In 1996, Givens co-starred on the sitcom &quot;Sparks&quot;, which aired for two seasons on UPN. In January 2000, she took over hosting duties on the syndicated talk show &quot;Forgive or Forget&quot;. In 2007, Givens released her autobiography, &quot;Grace Will Lead Me Home&quot;. She has since had recurring roles on &quot;The Game&quot;, &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s House of Payne&quot;, &quot;Chuck,&quot; &quot;Riverdale&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Katy Keene&quot;, and has been part of the main cast of &quot;Batwoman&quot;. In 2020, Givens began working as a television and film director.

==Early life==
Givens&#x27; mother raised Robin and her sister Stephanie in Mount Vernon and New Rochelle, New York. Givens was raised Catholic. She occasionally modeled and acted as a teen. As a model, she appeared in magazines such as &quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;. She made her film debut at age 14 in the film &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978) as a guest at Aunt Emma&#x27;s Party.

Givens graduated from New Rochelle Academy (a private school which closed in June 1987). At the age of 15, she enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College as a pre-medical major, becoming one of the youngest to attend the school. While in school she acted in daytime dramas. She graduated at the age of 19 in 1984. Givens claimed to have dropped out of Harvard Medical School to focus on her acting career, but the registrar&#x27;s office stated that she never applied.

==Career==
===1980s–1990s===
In 1985, Givens auditioned for a guest spot on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. She won the spot and Bill Cosby became her mentor. He persuaded her to drop out of school and promised that if she was not successful in two years, he would get her back into medical school and pay her tuition. Soon after Givens appeared in &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and the 1986 television film &quot;Beverly Hills Madam&quot;, opposite Faye Dunaway. That same year, she landed her breakthrough role as rich girl Darlene Merriman on the ABC sitcom &quot;Head of the Class&quot;. The series lasted five seasons, ending in 1991. In 1989, while starring in &quot;Head of the Class&quot;, she appeared in &quot;The Women of Brewster Place&quot; with Oprah Winfrey. She later starred in the feature films &quot;A Rage in Harlem&quot; (1991) and &quot;Boomerang&quot; (1992).

In 1994, Givens posed nude for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. During that period Givens felt she had lost her voice, so one of the reasons why she posed for the magazine was so that she could write her own article. Givens was ranked No. 88 on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Sexiest Stars in Film History&quot; list in May 1995. In 1996, Givens portrayed Claudia in the television movie &quot;The Face&quot; (also known as &quot;A Face to Die For&quot;) with Yasmine Bleeth. Later that year, she co-starred in the UPN sitcom &quot;Sparks&quot;, which ended its run in 1998. She also played Denise in &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;.

===2000s–2010s===
In January 2000, Givens appeared in a cameo in Toni Braxton&#x27;s music video &quot;He Wasn&#x27;t Man Enough&quot;, as the wife of a cheating husband. She returned to the entertainment industry later that year as the host of the talk show &quot;Forgive or Forget&quot;, replacing television personality Mother Love halfway through the show&#x27;s second season. Ratings initially increased after Givens took over hosting duties, but soon fell. The series was canceled after this season.

In 2006, Givens attempted a return to television on MyNetworkTV&#x27;s telenovela &quot;Saints and Sinners&quot;, but the show garnered low ratings and was soon canceled. Givens continued acting in made-for-television films while also making appearances on Trinity Broadcasting Network&#x27;s &quot;Praise the Lord&quot; program (July 12, 2007), and &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. In June 2007, she released her autobiography &quot;Grace Will Lead Me Home&quot;. Givens returned to feature films in Tyler Perry&#x27;s Southern drama &quot;The Family That Preys&quot; (2008). She also had a recurring role portraying a fictionalized version of herself on the CW comedy-drama &quot;The Game&quot;. Additionally, she has had a recurring role on the TBS show &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s House of Payne&quot;, and a guest role on USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Burn Notice&quot;. In addition to television and film roles, Givens has performed onstage. In 2001, she appeared in an off-Broadway production of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. From February to April 16, 2006, she played the role of Roxie Hart in the Broadway play &quot;Chicago&quot;. In 2007, she toured the country playing a part in the I&#x27;m Ready Productions play &quot;Men, Money &amp; Golddiggers&quot;. Givens starred in the 2009 stage play &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, which also starred Johnny Gill, Shirley Murdock, and Jermaine Crawford.

In 2007, Givens published a memoir entitled &quot;Grace Will Lead Me Home&quot;. In it, she reflects on the life of her praying grandmother, Grace, her experiences of domestic violence, her strong will to survive, feeling abandoned by her father, and her faith in God. In 2011, she guest-starred in three episodes of NBC&#x27;s spy-comedy &quot;Chuck&quot;: &quot;Chuck Versus the Masquerade&quot;, &quot;Chuck Versus the A-Team&quot;, and &quot;Chuck Versus the Muuurder&quot;, as Jane Bentley. Later that year, she performed as Angel, a struggling blues singer, in the play &quot;Blues for An Alabama Sky&quot; at Pasadena Playhouse. In 2015, she starred alongside Clifton Powell, Mishon Ratliff, and Malachi Malik in the segment &quot;Mama&#x27;s Boy&quot; of TV One&#x27;s anthology romance horror film &quot;Fear Files&quot;.

Givens was the spokesperson for the National Domestic Violence Hotline for several years.

In 2017, Givens hosted the San Diego Black Film Festival as she had for the several previous years.

===2020s===
In 2020, Givens made her directorial debut with the Lifetime mystery thriller film, &quot;A Murder to Remember&quot;. She later directed films &quot;Favorite Son&quot; (2021) and its sequel, &quot;Favorite Son Christmas&quot; (2023), &quot;A Jenkins Family Christmas&quot; (2021) and &quot;The Christmas Clapback&quot; (2022), all for BET+. In 2021, she directed the horror films &quot;Haunted Trail&quot; and &quot;Horror Noire&quot;. In 2023 she directed the comedy film, &quot;The Nana Project&quot;.

In 2021, Givens was cast in season three of &quot;Batwoman&quot; as Jada Jet, the CEO of Jeturian Industries and Ryan Wilder&#x27;s biological mother who is based on Jezebel Jet.

In 2022, Givens appeared in the Lifetime film &quot;He&#x27;s Not Worth Dying For&quot; as part of its &quot;Ripped from the Headlines&quot; feature films that was inspired by the feud of Rachel Wade and Sarah Ludemann. She portrayed Cher Heinemann, the mother of Grace Heinemann who was based on Ludemann.
Givens directed the episodes of television series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;, &quot;So Help Me Todd&quot; and &quot;Elsbeth&quot;.

==Personal life==
Givens began dating boxer Mike Tyson in 1987. According to Givens, Tyson was physically abusive before they wed on February 7, 1988. Tyson stated that he was &quot;severely traumatized by that relationship.&quot; Tyson was then estimated to be worth $50 million; he and Givens did not have a prenuptial agreement. During their marriage, Givens bought a $4.3 million mansion in the affluent suburb of Bernardsville, New Jersey with money withdrawn from Tyson&#x27;s brokerage account. They appeared in a Diet Pepsi commercial together and on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. 

After her miscarriage in June 1988, their marriage began to fall apart. Tyson claims Givens&#x27; pregnancy and miscarriage were part of a ruse to rush him into marriage, claiming that in all the time she was supposedly pregnant, Givens never gained a pound. In a joint interview with Tyson on &quot;20/20&quot; in September 1988, Givens told Barbara Walters that life with him was &quot;torture, pure hell, worse than anything I could possibly imagine,&quot; and she went on to describe his volatile temper. In October 1988, Givens filed for divorce, citing spousal abuse and was granted a temporary restraining order. Her attorney Marvin Mitchelson said, &quot;She loves Michael Tyson, but there is continued violence, and she fears for her safety.&quot; Tyson sought an annulment, accusing her of stealing millions of dollars and manipulating the public. Givens responded by filing a $125 million libel suit for defamation. Their divorce was finalized on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1989.

Givens received negative press following her split from Tyson, particularly within the sports and African-American communities. Headlines heralded her as &quot;the Most Hated Woman in America&quot; and she was described as a &quot;gold digger who married Tyson solely for his millions.&quot; Givens denied that she received a reported divorce settlement of over $10 million from Tyson, stating that she &quot;didn&#x27;t receive one dime.&quot;

According to the 1989 biography &quot;Fire and Fear: The Inside Story of Mike Tyson&quot;, Tyson admitted he punched Givens, stating &quot;that was the best punch I&#x27;ve ever thrown in my entire life.&quot; Tyson later claimed the book was &quot;filled with inaccuracies.&quot; In 2009, Tyson joked about &quot;socking&quot; Givens on &quot;Oprah&quot;, which caused laughter in the audience. Winfrey later issued an apology to Givens.

In 1993, Givens adopted her first son, Michael &quot;Buddy&quot; Givens. In 1997, she married her tennis instructor, Svetozar Marinković. Givens filed for divorce months later. In 1999, she had a biological son, William &quot;Billy&quot; Jensen, with ex-boyfriend, tennis player Murphy Jensen.

In January 2004, Givens struck a pedestrian while driving an SUV through a Miami, Florida, intersection. Givens was ticketed for failing to use due care with a pedestrian in a crosswalk, but the charges were later dismissed. In June 2004, the injured party filed a civil lawsuit against Givens for an unspecified amount.

A May 7, 2009, article in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine reported that the Internal Revenue Service was suing Givens for unpaid federal income taxes totaling $292,000 ($ in present-day USD when adjusted for inflation), an amount which included interest and penalties. The government had asked a federal court in Florida for a judgment against her on 39 assessments covering a span of eight years.

<text>The Stardroppers is a science fiction novel by British writer John Brunner. It was originally published at novella-length in 1962 as Listen, the Stars, in &quot;Analog&quot; and then as part of an Ace Double in 1963; in 1972 the revised, novel-length form was published by DAW Books.

== Plot introduction ==
&quot;The Stardroppers&quot; is about an undercover United Nations agent investigating a new fad, &quot;stardropping&quot;, whereby physics-violating equipment is used to listen to sounds believed to be alien or paranormal signals. Superficially a harmless but expensive hobby, stardropping reigns in a fanaticism resembling addiction, where some users assemble in semi-social communes and spend all of their money on increasingly improved equipment. The fad gains an additional aspect of risk when users begin disappearing into thin air, in cases of increasing profile and witnessing.

==Reception==
Lester del Rey characterized the novel as &quot;a good adventure story [but] not of one Brunner&#x27;s stronger literary efforts.&quot;

<text>Paul Pimsleur (October 17, 1927 – June 22, 1976) was a French-American linguist and scholar in the field of applied linguistics. He developed the Pimsleur language learning system, which, along with his many publications, had a significant effect upon theories of language learning and teaching. Pimsleur Language Programs is an American language learning company that develops and publishes courses based on the Pimsleur Method.

== Early life and education ==
Paul M. Pimsleur was born in New York City and grew up in The Bronx. His father, Solomon Pimsleur, was a Jewish immigrant from France and a composer of music; his American-born mother, Miera, was a librarian at Columbia University. Pimsleur earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree at the City College of New York, and from Columbia University he earned a master&#x27;s degree in psychological statistics and a PhD in French.

== Career ==
His first position involved teaching French phonetics and phonemics at the University of California, Los Angeles. After leaving UCLA, Pimsleur went on to faculty positions at the Ohio State University, where he taught French and foreign language education. At the time, the foreign language education program at OSU was the major doctoral program in that field in the U.S. While at Ohio State he created and directed the Listening Center, one of the largest language laboratories in the United States. The center was developed in conjunction with Ohio Bell Telephone and allowed self-paced language study using a series of automated tapes and prompts that were delivered over the telephone.

Later, Pimsleur was a professor of education and Romance languages at The State University of New York at Albany, where he held dual professorships in education and French. He was a Fulbright lecturer at the Ruprecht Karls University of Heidelberg in 1968 and 1969 and a founding member of the &quot;American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages&quot; (ACTFL). He did research on the psychology of language learning and in 1969 was section head of psychology of second languages learning at the International Congress of Applied Linguistics.

His research focused on understanding the language acquisition process, especially the learning process of children, who speak a language without knowing its formal structure. The term &quot;organic learning&quot; was applied to that phenomenon. For this, he studied the learning process of groups made of children, adults, and multilingual adults. The result of this research was the Pimsleur Language Programs. His many books and articles affected theories of language learning and teaching.

In the period from 1958 to 1966, Pimsleur reviewed previously published studies regarding linguistic and psychological factors involved in language learning. He also conducted several studies with support from Ohio State or from the US Office of Education. This led to the publication in 1963 of a coauthored monograph, &quot;Underachievement in Foreign Language Learning&quot;, which was published in the International Review of Applied Linguistics.

Through this research, he identified three factors that could be used to calculate language learning aptitude: verbal intelligence, auditory ability, and motivation. Pimsleur was the primary author of the Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery (PLAB) based on these three factors to assess language aptitude. He concluded that low auditory ability was a major factor in underachievement. Pimsleur was one of the first foreign language educators to show an interest in students who have difficulty in learning a foreign language while doing well in other subjects. Today, the PLAB is used to determine foreign language-learning aptitude, or even a foreign language-learning disability, among secondary-school students.

== Death ==
Pimsleur died unexpectedly of a heart attack during a visit to France in 1976.

== Legacy ==
Since its creation in 1977, &quot;The ACTFL-MLJ Paul Pimsleur Award for Research in Foreign Language Education&quot;, which is awarded annually, bears his name.

Pimsleur&#x27;s business partner, Charles Heinle, continued to develop the Pimsleur courses until he sold the company to Simon &amp; Schuster Audio in 1997.

In 2006, Pimsleur&#x27;s daughter, Julia Pimsleur, created the Entertainment Immersion Method® inspired by the Pimsleur Method, which is the foundation of the Little Pim language teaching program for young children, sold in the U.S. and 22 countries.

In 2013, Simon &amp; Schuster reissued Dr. Paul Pimsleur&#x27;s out-of-print book &quot;How to Learn a Foreign Language&quot; in hardcover and eBook format to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Paul Pimsleur&#x27;s first course.

<text>Ami Bluebell Dolenz ( ; born January 8, 1969) is an American retired actress.

== Early life==
Dolenz was born in Burbank, California, into a show business family. She is the daughter of Micky Dolenz of the 1960s group the Monkees, and British television presenter Samantha Juste. Her paternal grandparents were the film actors George Dolenz and Janelle Johnson.

==Career==
At age 15, Dolenz won a junior talent contest and decided to become an actress. She dropped out of high school and began appearing in roles on various television series. One of her first acting roles was in the television movie &quot;The Children of Times Square&quot;, followed by a two-episode stint on &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. In 1987, she had a small role in the comedy &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;. Later that year, she landed the role of Melissa McKee in the long-running soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;; the role garnered critical attention for Dolenz and she earned two nominations (in 1988 and 1989, respectively) for a Young Artist Award.

After leaving &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1989, Dolenz landed a co-starring role opposite Tony Danza in &quot;She&#x27;s Out of Control&quot;. The following year, she portrayed Sloane Peterson in &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot;, a television sitcom based on &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, which lasted only thirteen episodes and was cancelled in 1991. After its demise, Dolenz starred in &quot;Children of the Night&quot; and then had the lead role in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Miracle Beach&quot;.

Throughout the 1990s, Dolenz continued to appear in films and television, including &quot;Witchboard 2: The Devil&#x27;s Doorway&quot;; &quot;Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Wake, Rattle and Roll&quot;; &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot;; &quot;Demolition University&quot;; &quot;Pacific Blue&quot;; and &quot;Teen Angel&quot;. In 1998, she voiced a character for the children&#x27;s show &quot;The Secret Files of the Spy Dogs&quot;. After a four-year hiatus from acting, Dolenz returned in the independent film &quot;Mr. Id&quot;, in a co-starring role with Steve Parlavecchio. In 2007, she appeared in the film &quot;Even If&quot;, which she also produced.

== Personal life ==
On August 10, 2002, Dolenz married actor and martial artist Jerry Trimble.

In addition to acting, Dolenz and her husband manage KidPix Productions, a company that stages movie shoots as birthday parties for children. She also performs with the Write Act Repertory Theatre, and owns Bluebell Boutique, an online custom jewelry shop that she previously co-owned and operated with her late mother.

<doc id="66364" wikidata="Q126478118" url="?curid=66364" title="Moggy">
<text>A moggy is any cat which has not been intentionally bred. Moggies lack a standard appearance unlike pedigree cats which have a standard. In contexts where cats need to be registered—such as in veterinary practices or shelters—they are called a &#x27;domestic short-hair&#x27; or &#x27;domestic long-hair&#x27; depending on coat length. Although not as common as the aforementioned designations sometimes &#x27;domestic medium-hair&#x27; is also used.

The vast majority of cats worldwide lack any pedigree ancestry.
==History==

Cat fancying is relatively new, with over 85% of cat breeds coming into existence since the 1930s.

==Demography==
In the US domestic short-haired cats make up 95% of the cat population. In the UK 89–92% of cats are of non-pedigree lineage.

==Domestic shorthair==

In the cat fancy, and among veterinarians and animal control agencies, domestic short-haired cats may be classified with organisation-specific terminology (often capitalized), such as: 
*Domestic Shorthair (DSH)
* House Cat, Shorthair (HCS), or 
* Shorthair Household Pet.

Such a pseudo-breed is used for registry as well as shelter/rescue classification purposes. While not bred as show cats, some domestic short-haired cats are actually pedigreed and entered into cat shows that have non-purebred &quot;Household Pet&quot; divisions. Show rules vary; Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) permits &quot;any eye colour, all coat colours and patterns, any coat length or texture, and any length of tail&quot; (basically, any cat). Others may be more restrictive; an example from the World Cat Federation: &quot;All classic colours are permitted. Any amount of white is permitted. The colours chocolate and cinnamon, as well as their dilution (lilac and fawn) are not recognized in any combinations (bicolour, tricolour, tabby). The pointed pattern is also not recognized.&quot;

Domestic short-haired cats are characterised by a wide range of colouring, and typically &quot;revert to type&quot; after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby cat. This can be any colour or combination of colours. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics, and as a result, domestic short-haired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a &quot;classic&quot; Siamese or Tonkinese, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.

==Domestic longhair==
A domestic long-haired cat is a cat of mixed ancestry – thus not belonging to any particular recognized cat breed – possessing a coat of semi-long to long fur. Domestic long-haired cats should not be confused with the British Longhair, American Longhair, or other breeds with &quot;Longhair&quot; names, which are standardized breeds defined by various registries. Other generic terms are in British English, &quot;moggie&quot; and in American English &quot;alley cat&quot;. Domestic long-haired cats are the third most common type of cat in the United States.

In the cat fancy, and among veterinarians and animal control agencies, domestic long-haired cats may be classified with organisation-specific terminology (often capitalized), such as Domestic Longhair (DLH), House Cat, Longhair (HCL), or Semi-Longhair Household Pet. Such a pseudo-breed is used for registry and shelter/rescue classification purposes, and breeds such as the Persian cat. While not bred as show cats, some mixed-breed cats are actually pedigreed and entered into cat shows that have non-purebred &quot;Household Pet&quot; divisions. Show rules vary; Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) permits &quot;any eye colour, all coat colours and patterns, any coat length or texture, and any length of tail&quot; (basically any healthy cat). Others may be more restrictive; an example from the World Cat Federation: &quot;The colours chocolate and cinnamon, as well as their dilution (lilac and fawn) are not recognized in any combinations...[and] the pointed pattern is also not recognized&quot;.


Domestic long-haireds come in all genetically possible cat colors including tabby, tortoiseshell, bicolor cat, and smoke. Domestic long-haireds can have fur that is up to six inches long. They can also have a mane similar to a Maine Coon&#x27;s, as well as toe tufts and ear tufts. Some long-haired cats are not able to maintain their own coat, which must be frequently groomed by a human or may be prone to matting. Because of their wide gene pool, domestic long-haireds are not predisposed to any genetically inherited problems.

===History===
Having apparently originated in Western Asia, domestic long-haired cats have been kept as pets around the world for several centuries. During the 16th century, the first long-haired cats were imported into Europe. In the mid-17th century, when the Great Plague of London decimated much of London&#x27;s human population, the number of cats started to recover after centuries of persecution, as they were encouraged as protectors from flea-carrying rats.

How the variant developed is still a matter of speculation. The long coat may have been the result of a recessive mutant gene. When a long-haired cat is mated to one with a short coat, only short-haired kittens can result; however, their offspring, when mated, can produce a proportion of long-coated kittens. Successive litters of early European long-haired cats produced more and more long-coated offspring, which were more likely to survive in the cooler European climates. By the year 1521, around the time they were first documented in Italy, the variety had become fixed after only a few generations.In the late-18th century, Peter Simon Pallas advanced the hypothesis that the manul (also known as Pallas&#x27;s cat) might be the ancestor of the long-haired domestic cat. He had anecdotal evidence that established even though the male offspring would be sterile hybrids, the female offspring could again reproduce with domestic cats and pass on a small proportion of the manul&#x27;s genes. In 1907, zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock refuted this claim, citing his work on the skull differences between the manul and the Angoras or Persians of his time. This early hypothesis overlooked the potential for crossbreeding within the family Felidae. For example, the Savannah cat is a crossbreed between a domestic short-haired cat and a wild serval—both of which have different skulls and evolutionary lineage. Furthermore, hybrid females in the related genus &quot;Panthera&quot;, such as ligers and tigons, have successfully mated, producing tiligers and litigons.

The first modern, formal breeds of long-haired cats were the Persian and the Angora (named after Ankara, Turkey) and were said to have come from those two areas.

<text>A kitten is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens display primary altriciality and are fully dependent on their mothers for survival. They normally do not open their eyes for seven to ten days. After about two weeks, kittens develop quickly and begin to explore the world outside their nest. After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow baby teeth. Domestic kittens are highly social animals and usually enjoy human companionship.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;kitten&quot; derives from the Middle English word , which in turn came from the Old French or . Juvenile big cats are called &quot;cubs&quot; rather than kittens; either term (but usually more commonly &quot;kitten&quot;) may be used for the young of smaller wild felids, such as ocelots, caracals, and lynxes.

==Development==

A feline litter usually consists of two to five kittens, but litters with one to more than ten are known. Kittens are typically born after a gestation lasting between 64 and 67 days, with an average length of 66 days. When they are born, kittens emerge in a sac called the amnion, which is bitten off and eaten by the mother cat.

For the first several weeks, kittens cannot urinate or defecate without being stimulated by their mother. They also cannot regulate their body temperature for the first three weeks, so kittens born in temperatures less than can die from hypothermia if their mother does not keep them warm. The mother&#x27;s milk is very important for the kittens&#x27; nutrition and proper growth. This milk transfers antibodies to the kittens, which helps protect them against infectious diseases. As mentioned above, they cannot urinate, so they have a very high requirement for fluids. Kittens open their eyes about seven to ten days after birth. At first, the retina is poorly developed and vision is poor. Kittens cannot see as well as adult cats until about ten weeks after birth.

Kittens develop very quickly from about two weeks of age until their seventh week. Their coordination and strength improve, and they play-fight with their litter-mates and begin to explore the world outside the nest or den. They learn to wash themselves and others as well as play hunting and stalking games, showing their inborn ability as predators. These innate skills are developed by the kittens&#x27; mother or other adult cats, who bring live prey to the nest. Later, the mother demonstrates hunting techniques for the kittens to emulate. As they reach three to four weeks old, the kittens are gradually weaned and begin to eat solid food, with weaning usually complete by six to eight weeks. Kittens generally begin to lose their baby teeth around three months of age, and they have a complete set of adult teeth by nine months. Kittens live primarily on solid food after weaning, but usually continue to suckle from time to time until separated from their mothers. Some mother cats will scatter their kittens as early as three months of age, while others continue to look after them until they approach sexual maturity.

The sex of kittens is usually easy to determine at birth. By six to eight weeks this becomes harder because of the growth of fur in the genital region. The male&#x27;s urethral opening is round, whereas the female&#x27;s urethral opening is a slit. Another marked difference is the distance between anus and urethral opening, which is greater in males than in females.

Kittens are highly social animals and spend most of their waking hours interacting with available animals and playing on their own. Play with other kittens peaks in the third or fourth month after birth, with more solitary hunting and stalking play peaking later, at about five months.

Kittens are vulnerable because they like to find dark places to hide, sometimes with fatal results if they are not watched carefully. Cats have a habit of seeking refuge under or inside cars or on top of car tires during stormy or cold weather. This often leads to broken bones, burns, heat stroke, damaged internal organs or death.

Domestic kittens are commonly sent to new homes at six to eight weeks of age, but it has been suggested that being with their mother and litter-mates from six to twelve weeks is important for a kitten&#x27;s social and behavioural development. Usually, breeders and foster/rescue homes will not sell or adopt out a kitten that is younger than twelve weeks. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to give away kittens younger than eight weeks of age. Kittens generally reach sexual maturity at around seven months old. A cat reaches full &quot;adulthood&quot; around one year of age.

==Health==
Domestic kittens in developed societies are usually vaccinated against common illnesses from two to three months of age. The usual combination vaccination protects against feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR), feline calicivirus (C), and feline panleukopenia (P). This FVRCP inoculation is usually given at eight, twelve, and sixteen weeks, and an inoculation against rabies may be given at sixteen weeks. Kittens are usually spayed or neutered at seven months of age, but kittens may be neutered as young as seven weeks (if large enough), especially in animal shelters. Such early neutering does not appear to have any long-term health risks to cats, and may even be beneficial in male cats. Kittens are commonly given deworming treatments for roundworms from about four weeks.


==Nutrition==

Felines are carnivores and have adapted to animal-based diets and low carbohydrate inclusion. Kittens are categorized in a growth life stage, and have high energy and protein requirements. When feeding a kitten, it is often recommended to use highly digestible ingredients and various components to aid in development in order to produce a healthy adult. In North America, diets certified by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) are accepted as adequate nutrition, thus kitten diets should be AAFCO approved to ensure full supplementation. Key components of the diet are high fat content to meet caloric requirements of growth, high protein to meet requirements for muscle growth as well as supplementation of certain nutrients such as docosahexaenoic acid to benefit the development of the brain and optimization of cognition.

=== Pre-weaning nutrition ===

==== Establishing immunity ====
Part of the kitten&#x27;s immune system is the mucosal immune system, which is within the gastrointestinal tract. The mucosal immune system is largely responsible for coordinating proper immune responses by tolerating innocuous antigens and attacking foreign pathogens. In order to optimize kitten health and increase chances of survival, it is important to optimize the link between the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract. Lasting health and longevity can be accomplished partly through proper nutrition and establishing a healthy gut from birth through utilizing colostrum.Within the first two days after birth, kittens acquire passive immunity from their mother&#x27;s milk. Milk within the first few days of parturition is called colostrum, and contains high concentrations of immunoglobulins. These include immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G which cross the intestinal barrier of the neonate. The immunoglobulins and growth factors found in the colostrum begin to establish and strengthen the weak immune system of the offspring. Kittens are able to chew solid food around 5–6 weeks after birth, and it is recommended that 30% of their diet should consist of solid food at this time. The kitten remains on the mother&#x27;s milk until around eight weeks of age when weaning is complete and a diet of solid food is the primary food source.

=== Post-weaning nutrition ===

==== Fat ====
Until approximately one year of age, the kitten is undergoing a growth phase where energy requirements are up to 2.5 times higher than maintenance. Pet nutritionists often suggest that a commercial cat food designed specifically for kittens should be offered beginning at four weeks of age. Fat has a higher caloric value than carbohydrates and protein, supplying 9 kcal/g. The growing kitten requires arachidonic and linoleic acid which can be provided in omega-3 fatty acids. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is another vital nutrient that can be supplied through omega 3 fatty acid. Addition of DHA to the diet benefits the cognition, brain and visual development of kittens.

==== Protein ====
Cats are natural carnivores and require high amounts of protein in the diet. Kittens are undergoing growth and require high amounts of protein to provide essential amino acids that enable the growth of tissues and muscles. It is recommended that kittens consume a diet containing approximately 30% protein, on a dry matter basis, for proper growth.

Taurine is an essential amino acid found only in animal tissue; the mother cat cannot produce enough of it for her kittens. As it is an indispensable amino acid, it must be provided exogenously through the diet at 10 mg per kg of bodyweight, each day. Kittens deprived of taurine can experience poor growth and can result in retinal degeneration in cats.

==== Carbohydrates ====
Felines are natural carnivores and do not intentionally consume large quantities of carbohydrates. The domestic cat&#x27;s liver has adapted to the lack of carbohydrates in the diet by using amino acids to produce glucose to fuel the brain and other tissues. Studies have shown that carbohydrate digestion in young kittens is much less effective than that of a mature feline with a developed gastrointestinal tract. Highly digestible carbohydrates can be found in commercial kitten food as a source of additional energy as well as a source of fiber to stimulate the immature gut tissue. Soluble fibre such as beet pulp is a common ingredient used as a fibrous stool hardener and has been proven to strengthen intestinal muscles and to thicken the gut mucosal layer to prevent diarrhea.

===Diet composition===

====Amino acids====
The lack of readily available glucose from the limited carbohydrates in the diet has resulted to the adaptation of the liver to produce glucose from the breakdown components of protein—amino acids. The enzymes that breakdown amino acids are constantly active in cats. Thus, cats need a constant source of protein in their diet. Kittens require an increased amount of protein to supply readily available amino acids for daily maintenance and for building new body components because they are constantly growing. There are many required amino acids for kittens. Histidine is required at no greater than 30% in kitten diets, since consuming histidine-free diets causes weight loss. Tryptophan is required at 0.15%, seeing as it maximizes performance at this level. Kittens also need the following amino acids supplemented in their diet: arginine to avoid an excess of ammonia in the blood, otherwise known as hyperammonemia, isoleucine, leucine, valine, lysine, methionine as a sulfur-containing amino acid, asparagine for maximal growth in the early post-weaning kitten, threonine and taurine to prevent central retinal degeneration.

====Vitamins====

&quot;Fat-soluble vitamins&quot;

Vitamin A is required in kitten diets because cats cannot convert carotenes to retinol in the intestinal mucosa because they lack the necessary enzyme; this vitamin must be supplemented in the diet. Vitamin E is another required vitamin in kitten diets; deficiency leads to steatitis, causing the depot fat to become firm and yellow-orange in colour, which is painful and leads to death. Also, vitamin D is an essential vitamin because cats cannot convert it from precursors in the skin.

&quot;Water-soluble vitamins&quot;

Cats can synthesize niacin, but their breakdown exceeds the rate that it can be synthesized and thus, have a higher need for it, which can be fulfilled through an animal-based diet. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is required in increased amounts because it is needed to produce amino acids. Vitamin B12 is an AAFCO-recommended vitamin that is essential in the metabolism of carbohydrates and protein and maintains a healthy nervous system, healthy mucous membranes, healthy muscle and heart function, and, in general, promotes normal growth and development. Choline is also a AAFCO recommended ingredient for kittens, which is important for neurotransmission in the brain and as a component of membrane phospholipids. Biotin is another AAFCO-recommended vitamin to support thyroid and adrenal glands and the reproductive and nervous systems. Kittens also require riboflavin (vitamin B2) for heart health, pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), and folacin.

====Metabolism aids====
Since kitten diets are very high in calories, ingredients must be implemented to ensure adequate digestion and utilization of these calories. Choline chloride is an ingredient that maintains fat metabolism. Biotin and niacin are also active in the metabolism of fats, carbs and protein. Riboflavin is also necessary for the digestion of fats and carbohydrates. These are the main metabolism aids incorporated into kitten diets to ensure nutrient usage is maximized.

====Growth and development====
A combination of required nutrients is used to satisfy the overall growth and development of the kitten&#x27;s body; there are many ingredients that kittens do not require, but are included in diet formulation to encourage healthy growth and development. These ingredients include: dried egg as a source of high quality protein and fatty acids, flaxseed, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acid and aids in digestion, calcium carbonate as a source of calcium, and calcium pantothenate (vitamin B5) that acts as a coenzyme in the conversion of amino acids and is important for healthy skin.

====Immunity boosters====
Antioxidants help support the development of a healthy immune system through inhibiting the oxidation of other molecules, which are essential for a growing kitten. Antioxidants can be derived from ingredients such as carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, vitamin E and vitamin E supplement, and zinc proteinate.

==Orphaned kittens==

Kittens require a high-calorie diet that contains more protein than the diet of adult cats. Young orphaned kittens require cat milk every two to four hours, and they need physical stimulation to defecate and urinate. Cat milk replacement is manufactured to feed to young kittens, because cow&#x27;s milk does not provide all the necessary nutrients. Human-reared kittens tend to be very affectionate with humans as adults and sometimes more dependent on them than kittens reared by their mothers, but they can also show volatile mood swings and aggression. Depending on the age at which they were orphaned and how long they were without their mothers, these kittens may be severely underweight and can have health problems later in life, such as heart conditions. The compromised immune system of orphaned kittens (from lack of antibodies found naturally in the mother&#x27;s milk) can make them especially susceptible to infections, making antibiotics a necessity.

<text>The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA; ) is an act of the United States Congress. Since the formal recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Act has defined the officially substantial but non-diplomatic relations between the United States of America and Taiwan (Republic of China).

==Background==
At The Third Plenum in 1978, Deng Xiaoping became the paramount leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), definitively ending Maoist rule and beginning the reform era of Chinese history. During his speech at the plenum, he outlined a new Chinese foreign policy, whereby the Soviet Union—not the United States, as in the past—was identified as the main national security threat to China. During this time, China regarded itself as in a &quot;united front&quot; with the U.S., Japan, and western Europe against the Soviets. and thus established relations with the United States, China also supported American Operation Cyclone actions in Communist Afghanistan and leveled a military expedition against Vietnam, America&#x27;s main antagonist in Southeast Asia. In exchange, the United States abrogated its mutual defense treaty (SAMDT) with the Republic of China (ROC).

The ROC government mobilized the China Lobby in the United States to lobby Congress for the swift passage of an American security guarantee for the island. Taiwan could appeal to members of Congress on many fronts: anti-communist China sentiment, a shared wartime history with the ROC, Beijing&#x27;s human rights violations (despite committing violations of its own) and its curtailment of religious freedoms.

Senator Barry Goldwater and other members of the United States Congress challenged the right of President Jimmy Carter to cancel SAMDT unilaterally, which the US had signed with the ROC in December 1954 and was ratified by the U.S. Senate in February 1955. Goldwater and his co-filers of the US Supreme Court case &quot;Goldwater v. Carter&quot; argued that the President required Senate approval to take such an action of termination, under Article II, Section II of the U.S. Constitution, and that by not doing so, President Carter had acted beyond the powers of his office. The case ultimately was dismissed as non-justiciable and left open the constitutional question regarding a president&#x27;s authority to dismiss a treaty unilaterally.

The Act was passed by both chambers of Congress and signed by President Carter in 1979 after the breaking of relations between the US and the ROC. Congress rejected the U.S. State Department&#x27;s proposed draft and replaced it with language that has remained in effect since 1979. The TRA is intended to maintain commercial, cultural, and other relations through the unofficial relations in the form of a nonprofit corporation incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), without official government representation or formal diplomatic relations. The Act entered retroactively into force, effective January 1, 1979.

==Provisions==
===Definition of Taiwan===
The act does not recognize the terminology of &quot;Republic of China&quot; after 1 January 1979, but uses the terminology of &quot;governing authorities on Taiwan&quot;. Geographically speaking and following the similar content in the earlier defense treaty from 1955, it defines the term &quot;Taiwan&quot; to include, as the context may require, the island of Taiwan (the main Island) and the Pescadores (Penghu). Of the other islands or archipelagos under the control of the Republic of China, Kinmen, the Matsus, etc., are left outside the definition of Taiwan.

===&quot;De facto&quot; diplomatic relations===
The act authorizes &quot;de facto&quot; diplomatic relations with the governing authorities by giving special powers to the AIT to the level that it is the &quot;de facto&quot; embassy, and states that any international agreements made between the ROC and U.S. before 1979 are still valid unless otherwise terminated. One agreement that was unilaterally terminated by President Jimmy Carter upon the establishment of relations with the PRC was the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty.

The TRA provides for Taiwan to be treated under U.S. laws the same as &quot;foreign countries, nations, states, governments, or similar entities&quot;, thus treating Taiwan as a sub-sovereign foreign state equivalent. The act provides that for most practical purposes of the U.S. government, the absence of diplomatic relations and recognition will have no effect.

===Military provisions===

The TRA does not guarantee or relinquish the U.S. intervening militarily if the PRC attacks or invades Taiwan, as its primary purpose is to ensure that the Taiwan policy will not be changed unilaterally by the U.S. president and ensure any decision to defend Taiwan will be made with the consent of the Congress. The act states that &quot;the United States will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability&quot; and &quot;shall maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan&quot;. However, the decision about the nature and quantity of defense services that America will provide to Taiwan is to be determined by the President and Congress. America&#x27;s policy has been called &quot;strategic ambiguity,&quot; and it is designed to dissuade Taiwan from a unilateral declaration of independence, and to dissuade the PRC from unilaterally unifying Taiwan with the PRC.

The TRA further stipulates that the United States will &quot;consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States&quot;.

The TRA requires the United States to have a policy &quot;to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character&quot; and &quot;to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan&quot;.

Successive U.S. administrations have sold arms to Taiwan despite demands from the PRC that the U.S. follow Three Joint Communiqués and the U.S. government&#x27;s proclaimed One-China policy.

==Reaction and reaffirmation==
The TRA&#x27;s passage caused Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to begin viewing the United States as an insincere partner willing to abandon its previous commitments to China.

===Reagan administration===

The PRC aligned itself with the Third World countries rather than with the United States or the Soviet Union, engaging itself in various movements such as nuclear non-proliferation that would allow it to critique the superpowers. In the August 17th communique of 1982, the United States agreed to reduce arms sales to Taiwan. However, it also declared that it would not formally recognize PRC&#x27;s sovereignty over Taiwan, as part of the Reagan administration&#x27;s Six Assurances offered to Taipei in 1982.

===Clinton administration=== 
In the late 1990s, the United States Congress passed a non-binding resolution stating that relations between Taiwan and the United States will be honored through the TRA first. This resolution, which puts greater weight on the TRA&#x27;s value over that of the three communiques, was signed by President Bill Clinton. Both chambers of Congress have repeatedly reaffirmed the importance of the TRA.

===Since 2000===
A July 2007 Congressional Research Service Report confirmed that U.S. policy has not recognized the PRC&#x27;s sovereignty over Taiwan. The PRC continues to view the TRA as &quot;an unwarranted intrusion by the United States into the internal affairs of China&quot;. The United States has continued to supply Taiwan with armaments and China has continued to protest.

====Bipartisan affirmation (2016)====
On 19 May 2016, one day before Tsai Ing-wen assumed the democratically elected presidency of the Republic of China, U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Bob Menendez (D-NJ), former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and co-chair of the Senate Taiwan Caucus, introduced a concurrent resolution reaffirming the TRA and the &quot;Six Assurances&quot; as cornerstones of United States–Taiwan relations.

<doc id="66373" wikidata="Q3516564" url="?curid=66373" title="Taiwanization">
<text>Taiwanization (), also known as the Taiwanese localization movement, is a conceptual term used in Taiwan to emphasize the importance of a Taiwanese culture, society, economy, nationality, and identity rather than to regard Taiwan as solely an appendage of China. This involves the teaching of history, geography, and culture from a Taiwan-centric perspective, as well as promoting languages locally established in Taiwan, including Taiwanese Hokkien (Taiwanese), Hakka, and aboriginal languages.

The localization movement has been expressed in forms such as the use of language or dialect in the broadcast media and entire channels devoted to aboriginal and Hakka affairs. Textbooks have been rewritten by scholars to more prominently emphasize Taiwan. The political compromise that has been reached is to teach both the history of Taiwan and the history of mainland China.

Some Taiwanese state-owned companies or organizations established in an earlier era have names containing the words &quot;China&quot; or &quot;Chinese&quot;. They have been encouraged in recent years to change the word &quot;China&quot; in their names to &quot;Taiwan&quot; in a campaign known as the &quot;name rectification campaign&quot; () or &quot;Taiwan name rectification&quot;. Many Taiwan-based companies in international sectors already identify themselves as &quot;Taiwan&quot;-based for clarity&#x27;s sake. This keeps international customers from confusing them with an enterprise based in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Other Taiwan-based companies decline to change to a &quot;Taiwanese&quot; name because of expense or the political views held by important clients and company leaders.

== History and development ==
No one can confirm when the concept of Taiwanization has started. Some say when the first large wave of Han people emigrated from mainland China to Taiwan in the mid-16th century, they must have wanted to maintain some independence from the control of the ruling class in their original hometown. Others say that only when the Kingdom of Tungning, with its capital at Tainan, was built by the Zheng family in 1662, did this concept appear.

Most Chinese contemporary scholars of Mainland China believe the roots of the localization movement began during the Japanese rule (1895 to 1945), when groups organized to lobby the Imperial Japanese government for greater Taiwanese autonomy and home rule. After the Kuomintang (KMT) took over Taiwan, the Taiwan home-rule groups were decimated in the wake of the February 28 Incident of 1947. The KMT viewed Taiwan primarily as a base to retake mainland China and quickly tried to subdue potential political opposition on the island. The KMT did little to promote a unique Taiwanese identity; often newly immigrated Chinese or &quot;mainlanders&quot; as they were called, working in administrative positions, lived in neighborhoods where they were segregated from the Taiwanese. Others, especially poorer refugees, were shunned by the Hoklo Taiwanese and lived among aborigines instead. The mainlanders often learned Hokkien. However, since Mandarin was enforced as the official language of the Republic of China and Taiwanese was not allowed to be spoken in schools, the mainlanders who learned Taiwanese found their new language skills to diminish. As Taiwanese, or any language other than Mandarin, was forbidden in the military posts, many mainlanders whose family lived in martial villages only spoke Mandarin and perhaps their home language (e.g. Cantonese, Shanghainese, etc.). The promotion of Chinese nationalism within Taiwan and the fact that the ruling group on Taiwan were considered outsiders by some were the reasons cited for both the Taiwan independence movement and Taiwanization.

In the 1970s and 1980s there was a shift in power away from the KMT to people native to Taiwan. This, combined with cultural liberalization and the increasing remoteness of the possibility of retaking mainland China, led to a cultural and political movement which emphasized a Taiwan-centered view of history and culture rather than one which was China-centered or even, as before 1946, Japan-centered. Taiwanization was strongly supported by President Lee Teng-hui.

The &quot;Bentuhua&quot; or &quot;localization/indigenization movement&quot; was sparked in the mid-1970s with the growing expression of ethnic discontent due to unequal distribution of political and cultural power between mainlanders and Taiwanese people. Beginning in the 1960s, Taiwan was enveloped by the problems of rapid industrial development, rural abandonment, labor disputes and the uneven distribution of access to wealth and social power. These changes, combined with the loss of several key allies, forced the KMT regime to institute limited reforms. The reforms permitted under Chiang Ching-kuo allowed indigenization to increase as leading dissidents generated a response to the government&#x27;s failures. The dissident groups, united under the &quot;Tangwai&quot;, or “outside the party” banner, called for the government to accept the reality that it was only the government of Taiwan and not China. The key demands of the Tangwai involved instituting democracy and seeking international recognition as a sovereign state. Taiwanese demanded full civil rights as guaranteed under the ROC constitution and equal political rights as those experienced by the Mainlander elite.

The Taiwanese cultural elite fully promoted the development of &quot;Xiang tu&quot; literature and cultural activities, including rediscovering Taiwanese nativist literature written under Japanese colonial rule. The tangwai movement revived symbols of Taiwanese resistance to Japanese rule in the effort to mobilize ethnic Taiwanese. The opposition to the KMT&#x27;s China-centered cultural policies resulted in dissidents crafting new national-historical narratives that placed the island of Taiwan itself at the center of the island&#x27;s history. The Taiwanese emerged as a frequently colonized and often oppressed people. The concept of &quot;bentuhua&quot; was finally expressed in the cultural domain in the premise of Taiwan as a place with a unique society, culture and history. This principle has been largely adopted for understanding Taiwan&#x27;s cultural representation and expressed in a variety of cultural activities, including music, film and the literary and performing arts.

The pressures of indigenization and the growing acceptance of a unique Taiwanese cultural identity have met opposition from more conservative elements of Taiwan society. Critics argue that the new perspective creates a “false” identity rooted in ethnic nationalism as opposed to an “authentic” Chinese identity, which is primordial and inherent. Many mainlanders living on Taiwan complain that their own culture is marginalized by &quot;bentuhua&quot;, and initially expressed fear of facing growing alienation. In the past decade these complaints have subsided somewhat as Taiwan increasingly views itself as a pluralistic society that embraces many cultures and recognizes the rights of all citizens.

In the mid-to-late 1990s, gestures toward Taiwanization were increasingly adopted by pro-unification figures who, while supporting the Chinese nationalism of Chiang Kai-shek, saw it as appropriate, or at least advisable, to display more appreciation for cultures of Taiwan. Pro-unification politicians such as James Soong, the former head of the Government Information Office who once oversaw the limitation of Taiwanese dialects, began speaking in Hoklo on semi-formal occasions.

== 2000s name rectification campaign ==

The &quot;Name Rectification Campaign&quot; includes efforts by the Taiwanese government beginning in 2000 to distance itself from China and rollback earlier sinicization efforts by taking actions such as removing Chinese influence from items within Taiwan control. While the Taiwanese localization movement may view such efforts as emphasizing the importance of Taiwan&#x27;s culture, this section addresses the perspective of those who likely support the Chinese reunification of all of Greater China under a single political entity.
At the end of World War II, Chinese Kuomintang forces took over Taiwan and soon began an effort to sinicize the population. Taiwanese urban elites were wiped out in the February 28 Incident. Mandarin Chinese became the only language allowed in media and school to the exclusion of other languages of Taiwan, as well as Japanese. Public institutions and corporations were given names that included the words &quot;China&quot; or &quot;Chinese&quot;. School history and geography lessons focused on China with little attention paid to Taiwan. Street names in Taipei were changed from their original names to Chinese names that reflected the geography of China and Kuomintang ideals.

With the end of martial law in 1987 and the introduction of democracy in the 1990s after the Wild Lily student movement, an effort began to re-assert Taiwanese identity and culture while trying to get rid of many Chinese influences imposed by the Kuomintang.

=== Education and language campaign ===
In 2000, then-ROC president Lee Teng-hui began making statements such as &quot;Taiwan culture is not a branch of Chinese culture&quot; and &quot;Taiwan&#x27;s Minnan dialect is not a branch of Fujian&#x27;s Minnan, dialect but rather a &#x27;Taiwan dialect&#x27; Taiwan radio and TV increased their Taiwanese Hokkien programming. These efforts were perceived in China as initial efforts towards breaking the ties between Taiwan culture and Chinese culture by downplaying the long-term Chinese cultural and historic identification in that region.

In April 2003, the Committee for Promoting Mandarin, which was part of Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Education, released a legislation proposal entitled &quot;Language Equality Law.&quot; The proposed legislation sought to designate fourteen languages as the national languages of Taiwan. In mainland China, this was seen as an effort to diminish the use of standard Mandarin and its cultural influences in favor of revising the cultural and psychological foundations on the island of Taiwan by using other languages. The draft was not adopted.

The textbook issue was raised in November 2004, when a group of lawmakers, legislative candidates and supporters of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) urged the ROC Ministry of Education to publish Taiwan-centric history and geography textbooks for school children as part of the Taiwanization campaign. Although the resulting draft outline of history course for regular senior middle schools was criticized by a variety of groups, President Chen Shui-bian responded that &quot;to seek the truth of Taiwan&#x27;s history&quot; is not equal to desinicization nor an act of independence and indicated that he would not interfere with the history editing and compilation efforts.

The proposals to revise Taiwan&#x27;s history textbooks were condemned in February 2007 by the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council as being part of the desinicization campaign. In July 2007, the Taiwan Ministry of Education released a study that found 5,000 textbook terms, some relating to Chinese culture, as being &quot;unsuitable&quot;. The Kuomintang saw this as part of a textbook censorship desinicization campaign. The proposals have not been adopted.

=== Name change campaign ===
Between 2002 and 2007, the ROC government under Chen Shui-bian took steps to revise the terms &quot;China&quot;, &quot;Republic of China&quot;, &quot;Taipei&quot;, and others that impart an association with the Chinese culture.

In 2002, the &quot;Name Rectification Campaign&quot; made significant advances in replacing the terms &quot;China&quot;, &quot;Republic of China&quot;, or &quot;Taipei&quot; with the term &quot;Taiwan&quot; on official documents, in the names of Taiwan-registered organizations, companies, and public enterprises on the island, and in the names of businesses stationed abroad. In 2003, the ROC Foreign Ministry issued a new passport with the word &quot;Taiwan&quot; printed in English on its cover. Moreover, in January 2005, Taiwan adopted a Westernized writing format for government documents, denied that it was an attempt at desinicization, and promoted the actions as &quot;a concerted effort at globalizing Taiwan&#x27;s ossified bureaucracies and upgrading the nation&#x27;s competitive edge.&quot;

Campaigning in this area continued in March 2006, where the Democratic Progressive Party sought to change the Republic of China year designation used in Taiwan to the Gregorian calendar. Instead of the year 2006 being referred to as the &quot;95th year of the ROC&quot;—with the 1912 founding of the Republic of China being referred to as &quot;the first year of the ROC&quot;—the year 2006 would be identified as 2006 in official usage such as on banknotes, IDs, national health insurance cards, driver&#x27;s licenses, diplomas and wedding certificates. This was viewed as the government trying another angle for desinicization by removing any trace of China from Taiwan.

In February 2007, the term &quot;China&quot; was replaced by the term &quot;Taiwan&quot; on Taiwan postage stamps to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the February 28 Incident that began on 28 February 1947 that was violently suppressed by the Kuomintang (KMT). In that same month, the name of the official postal service of Taiwan was changed from the Chunghwa Post Co. to The Taiwan Post Co. The company&#x27;s name was changed back on 1 August 2008, and the names on the postal stamps were reversed in late 2008, soon after the Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Ma Ying-Jeou won back presidency and ended 8 years of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) rule.

In March 2007, the name plate of the ROC Embassy in Panama was revised both to include the word &quot;Taiwan&quot; in parentheses between the words &quot;the Republic of China&quot; and &quot;Embassy&quot; in both of its Chinese and Spanish titles, and to omit the ROC national emblem.

Supporters of the name-change movement argue that the Republic of China no longer exists, as it did not include Taiwan when it was founded in 1912 and mainland China is now controlled by the Chinese Communist Party as the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Furthermore, the ambiguity surrounding the legal status of Taiwan as a result of the Treaty of peace with Japan and Treaty of San Francisco after World War II, means that the Republic of China was merely a military occupier of Taiwan. As Japan relinquished its sovereignty over Taiwan without passing it to a specific country, it is argued that Taiwan ought to be deemed a land belonging to no country, whose international status has yet to be defined.

=== Constitutional and political campaign ===
In October 2003, President Chen Shui-bian announced that Taiwan would seek a new constitution suitable for the Taiwan people that would turn Taiwan into a &quot;normal country.&quot; In explaining what a normal country was in the context of desinicization and the 1992 One-China policy, Chen Shui-bian stated,

In response, the Pan-Blue Coalition within Taiwan sought to portray President Chen Shui-bian and his Democratic Progressive Party as radicals intent on implementing revolutionary desinicization that would disenfranchise various ethnic groups within Taiwan who have an affinity for China and the Chinese culture.

In February 2007, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) adopted a resolution to identify those responsible for the 1947 February 28 Incident massacre of Taiwanese people in order to charge them with war crimes and crimes against humanity. The effort also sought to remove the &quot;remnants of dictatorship&quot; traced to that sixty-year-old incident. This was seen in mainland China as being in line with a series of desinicization actions by both the Taiwan government and the DPP to rid both Chiang and China from the Taiwan public scene. Some applauded this as a courageous act of seeking justice. Others criticized the request, seeing it as &quot;rubbing salt into wounds&quot; by playing up the historical issues for political gain.

=== Other campaign ===
In March 2007, it was noted that the destruction of the Western Line railway base found below the floor of the Taipei Main Station and built in 1893 by Qing Empire-appointed Governor of Taiwan Province Liu Mingchuan was part of the government&#x27;s call for desinicization through removal of the Chinese site.

In July 2007, President Chen Shui-bian announced that he would allow mainland Chinese diplomas or students into Taiwan during the rest of his presidential term. This, however, was not achieved.

=== Impact ===
One phenomenon that has resulted from the Taiwanization movement is the advent of Taike subculture, in which young people consciously adopt the wardrobe, language and cuisine to emphasize the uniqueness of popular, grassroots Taiwanese culture, which in previous times had often been seen as provincial and backwards by the mainstream.

In April 2002, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) noted both active efforts on the part of Taiwan to push ahead its Taiwanization policy and intensified United States-Taiwan military cooperation. In response, the CCP publicly reminded its military to be prepared to achieve its goal of &quot;Chinese reunification&quot; (intended to mean making Taiwan a part of the People&#x27;s Republic of China) through military means. In addition, the CCP sought assistance from the United States to address the matter with Taiwan. As part of making the upcoming U.S. visit by then vice-president Hu Jintao go smoothly, the United States cautioned the Chen Shui-bian administration not to &quot;go too far&quot; in cross-Strait relations.

In April 2005, the CCP general secretary Hu Jintao and the former ROC Vice President and then chairman of the Kuomintang party (KMT) Lien Chan shook hands. Billed as a historic moment, this was the first handshake by the top leaders of the KMT and the CCP in 60 years. In remarking on the handshake, chairman Lien noted that it was a turning point where the KMT and the CCP would work together to bring about peaceful cross-strait relations and specifically distanced the KMT from Taiwan independence and desinicization efforts.

== Support and opposition ==
Significant outcries surfaced both within Taiwan and abroad opposing the concept of Taiwan localization in the early years after President Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s death, denouncing it as the &quot;independent Taiwan movement&quot; (Chinese: 台獨運動). Vocal opponents are primarily the 1949-generation Mainlanders, or older generations of Mainlanders living in Taiwan that had spent their formative years and adulthood on the pre-1949 mainland Republic of China, and native Taiwanese who identify with a pan-Han Chinese cultural identity. They included people ranging from academics like Chien Mu, reputed to be the last prominent Chinese intellectual opposing the conventional wisdom take on the May Fourth Movement, politicians like Lien Chan, from a family with a long history of active pan-Chinese patriotism despite being native Taiwanese, to gang mobsters like Chang An-lo, a leader of the notorious United Bamboo Gang.

The opposing voices were subsequently confined to the fringe in the mid 2000s Taiwan itself. Issues persist, particularly supporters of the Pan-Blue coalition, which advocates retaining a strong link to mainland China, dispute over such issues as what histories to teach. Nonetheless both of the two major political forces in Taiwan reached a consensus, and the movement has overwhelming support among the population. This is in part due to the 1949-generation Mainlanders have gradually passed on from the scene, and politicians supporting and opposing the Taiwanese independence movement both realize a majority of Taiwan&#x27;s current residents, either because they are born in Taiwan to Mainlander parents with no collective memories of their ancestral homes, or they are native Taiwanese, thus feeling no historical connotations with the entire pre-1949 Republic of China on mainland China, support the movement as such.

In mainland China, the PRC government has on the surface adopted a neutral policy on Taiwanization and its highest-level leaders publicly proclaim it does not consider the Taiwanization movement to be either a violation of its One China Policy or equivalent to the independence movement. Nonetheless, the state-owned media and academics employed by organizations such as universities&#x27; Institutes of Taiwan Studies or the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) periodically release study results, academic journal articles, or editorials strongly criticizing the movement as &quot;the cultural arm of Taiwanese independence movement&quot; (Chinese: 文化台獨) with the government&#x27;s tacit approval, showing the PRC government&#x27;s opposition towards Taiwanization.

Nowadays, another source of significant opposition to the Taiwanization movement remains in the overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia and the Western world, who identify more with the historic pre-1949 mainland Republic of China or pre-Taiwanization movement ROC on Taiwan that oriented itself as the rump legitimate government of China. A great many are themselves refugees and dissidents who fled mainland China, either directly or through Hong Kong or Taiwan, during the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the subsequent periods of destructive policies (such as the Land Reform, the Anti-Rightist Movement, Great Leap Forward, or the Cultural Revolution), Hong Kong anti-Communist immigrants who fled Hong Kong in light of the Handover to the PRC in 1997, or Mainlanders living in Taiwan who moved to the West in response to the Taiwanization movement. Conversely, the current population of Taiwan regard these overseas Chinese as foreigners akin to Singaporean Chinese, as opposed to the pre-Taiwanization era when they were labeled as fellow Chinese compatriots. The PRC has capitalized on this window of opportunity in making overtures to the traditionally anti-Communist overseas Chinese communities, including gestures in supporting traditional Chinese culture and dumping explicitly Communist tones in overseas communications. This results in a decline of active political opposition to the PRC from overseas Chinese when compared with the times before the Taiwanization movement in Taiwan.

In Hong Kong, Taiwanization movements have pushed localization or pro-Chinese Communist tilts among the traditionally pro-Republic of China individuals and organizations. A prominent example is Chu Hai College, whose academic degree programs were recognized officially by the Hong Kong SAR government in May 2004, and registered as an &quot;Approved Post-secondary College&quot; with the Hong Kong SAR government since July of the same year. It has since been renamed the Chu Hai College of Higher Education (珠海學院) and no longer registered with the Republic of China&#x27;s Ministry of Education. New students from 2004 have been awarded degrees in the right of Hong Kong rather than Taiwan.

==Role in domestic politics==

Even though it is a broad consensus currently regarding the overall ideology of Taiwanization, there are still deep disputes over practical policies between the three main political groups of Taiwan independence, Chinese reunification, and supporters of Chinese culture. Pro-independence supporters argue that Taiwan is and should be enhancing an identity which is separate from the Chinese one, and in more extreme cases advocates the removal of Chinese &quot;imprints&quot;. Meanwhile, some would argue that Taiwan should create a distinctive identity that either includes certain Chinese aspect or exists within a broader Chinese one. Those who support Chinese reunification call for a policy of enhancing the Chinese identity. Groups that support Chinese reunification and Chinese nationalism have emphasized the distinction between Taiwanization and what some perceive as desinicization and argued that they do not oppose the promotion of a Taiwanese identity, but rather oppose the use of that identity to separate itself from a broader Chinese one. On the other hand, a few apolitical groups have claimed that most of the political factions merely use these points to win support for elections.

<text>The TOPS-20 operating system by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) is a proprietary OS used on some of DEC&#x27;s 36-bit mainframe computers. The Hardware Reference Manual was described as for &quot;DECsystem-10/DECSYSTEM-20 Processor&quot; (meaning the DEC PDP-10 and the DECSYSTEM-20).

TOPS-20 began in 1969 as the TENEX operating system of Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) and shipped as a product by DEC starting in 1976. TOPS-20 is almost entirely unrelated to the similarly named TOPS-10, but it was shipped with the PA1050 TOPS-10 Monitor Calls emulation facility which allowed most, but not all, TOPS-10 executables to run unchanged. As a matter of policy, DEC did not update PA1050 to support later TOPS-10 additions except where required by DEC software.

TOPS-20 competed with TOPS-10, ITS and WAITS—all of which were notable time-sharing systems for the PDP-10 during this timeframe. TOPS-20 is informally known as TWENEX.

==TENEX==

TOPS-20 was based upon the TENEX operating system, which had been created by Bolt Beranek and Newman for Digital&#x27;s PDP-10 computer. After Digital started development of the KI-10 version of the PDP-10, an issue arose: by this point TENEX was the most popular customer-written PDP-10 operating systems, but it would not run on the new, faster KI-10s. To correct this problem, the DEC PDP-10 sales manager purchased the rights to TENEX from BBN and set up a project to port it to the new machine. In the end, very little of the original TENEX code remained, and Digital ultimately named the resulting operating system TOPS-20.

==PA1050==
Some of what came with TOPS-20 was merely an emulation of the TOPS-10 Operating System&#x27;s calls. These were known as UUO&#x27;s, standing for Unimplemented User Operation, and were needed both for compilers, which were not 20-specific, to run, as well as user-programs written in these languages. The package that was mapped into a user&#x27;s address space was named PA1050: PA as in PAT as in compatibility; 10 as in DEC or PDP 10; 50 as in a PDP 10 Model 50, 10/50, 1050.

Sometimes PA1050 was referred to as PAT, a name that was a good fit to the fact that PA1050, &quot;was simply unprivileged user-mode code&quot; that &quot;performed the requested action, using JSYS calls where necessary.&quot;

==TOPS-20 capabilities==
The major ways to get at TOPS-20 capabilities, and what made TOPS-20 important, were
* Commands entered via the command processor, EXEC.EXE
* JSYS (Jump to System) calls from MACro-language (.MAC) programs

The &quot;EXEC&quot; accomplished its work primarily using
* internal code, including calls via JSYS
* requesting services from &quot;GALAXY&quot; components (e.g. spoolers)

===Command processor===
Rather advanced for its day were some TOPS-20-specific features:
* Command completion
* Dynamic help in the form of 
:*&quot;noise-words&quot; - typing DIR and then pressing the ESCape key resulted in
::::DIRectory (of files)
::typing and pressing the key resulted in
:::: Information (about)

One could then type to find out what operands were permitted/required. Pressing displays status information.

===Commands===
The following list of commands are supported by the TOPS-20 Command Processor.

* ACCESS
* ADVISE
* APPEND
* ARCHIVE
* ASSIGN
* ATTACH
* BACKSPACE
* BLANK
* BREAK
* BUILD
* CANCEL
* CLOSE
* COMPILE
* CONNECT
* CONTINUE
* COPY
* CREATE
* CREF
* CSAVE
* DAYTIME
* DDT
* DEASSIGN
* DEBUG
* DEFINE
* DELETE
* DEPOSIT
* DETACH
* DIRECTORY
* DISABLE
* DISCARD
* DISMOUNT
* EDIT
* ENABLE
* END-ACCESS
* EOF
* ERUN
* EXAMINE
* EXECUTE
* EXPUNGE
* FDIRECTORY
* FORK
* FREEZE
* GET
* HELP
* INFORMATION
* KEEP
* LOAD
* LOGIN
* LOGOUT
* MERGE
* MODIFY
* MOUNT
* PERUSE
* PLOT
* POP
* PRINT
* PUNCH
* PUSH
* RECEIVE
* REENTER
* REFUSE
* REMARK
* RENAME
* RESET
* RETRIEVE
* REWIND
* RUN
* SAVE
* SEND
* SET
* SET HOST
* SKIP
* START
* SUBMIT
* SYSTAT
* TAKE
* TALK
* TDIRECTORY
* TERMINAL
* TRANSLATE
* TYPE
* UNATTACH
* UNDELETE
* UNKEEP
* UNLOAD
* VDIRECTORY

===JSYS features===
JSYS stands for Jump to SYStem. Operands were at times memory addresses. &quot;TOPS-20 allows you to use 18-bit or 30-bit addresses. Some monitor calls require one kind, some the other; some calls accept either kind. Some monitor calls use only 18 bits to hold an address. These calls interpret 18-bit addresses as locations in the current section.&quot;

Internally, files were first identified, using a GTJFN (Get Job File Number) JSYS, and then that JFN number was used to open (OPENF) and manipulate the file&#x27;s contents.

==PCL (Programmable Command Language)==
PCL (Programmable Command Language) is a programming language that runs under TOPS-20. PCL source programs are, by default, stored with Filetype .PCL, and enable extending the TOPS-20 EXEC via a verb named DECLARE. Newly compiled commands then become functionally part of the EXEC.

===PCL language features===
PCL includes:
* flow control: DO While/Until, CASE/SELECT, IF-THEN-ELSE, GOTO
* character string operations (length, substring, concatenation)
* access to system information (date/time, file attributes, device characteristics)

==TOPS-20 today ==
Paul Allen maintained several publicly accessible historic computer systems before his death, including an XKL TOAD-2 running TOPS-20.

<doc id="66382" wikidata="Q13174" url="?curid=66382" title="Beta Carinae">
<text>Beta Carinae is the second-brightest star in the southern constellation of Carina. It has the official name Miaplacidus; &quot;Beta Carinae&quot; is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation, which is Latinised from β Carinae and abbreviated Beta Car or β Car. With apparent magnitude of 1.69, it is one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It is the brightest star in the southern asterism known as the Diamond Cross, marking the southwestern end of the asterism. It lies near the planetary nebula IC 2448. Parallax measurements place it at a distance of from the Sun.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;β Carinae&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Beta Carinae&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

The star&#x27;s historical name &quot;Miaplacidus&quot; made its debut on star maps in 1856 when the star atlas &quot;Geography of the Heavens&quot;, composed by Elijah Hinsdale Burritt, was published. The meaning and linguistic origin of the name remained an enigma for many decades, until William Higgins, a great scholar and expert on star names, surmised that the name &quot;Miaplacidus&quot; is apparently a bilingual combination of Arabic &quot;مياه&quot; &quot;miyāh&quot; for &#x27;waters&#x27; and Latin &quot;placidus&quot; for &#x27;placid&#x27;. The IAU Working Group on Star Names first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Miaplacidus&quot; for this star.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Southern Boat&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of β Carinae, V337 Carinae, PP Carinae, θ Carinae and ω Carinae. Consequently, β Carinae itself is known as (, ).

==Physical properties==
The stellar classification of A1 III mean that Miaplacidus is an evolved giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and has expanded. It has an estimated age of 260 million years. This star does not show an excess emission of infrared radiation that might otherwise suggest the presence of a debris disk. It has about 3.8 times the Sun&#x27;s mass and has expanded to almost six times the radius of the Sun. Presently it is radiating 223 times as much luminosity as the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of . Despite its enlarged girth, this star still shows a rapid rotation rate, with a projected rotational velocity of .

<doc id="66388" wikidata="Q927234" url="?curid=66388" title="Bronchodilator">
<text>A bronchodilator or broncholytic (although the latter occasionally includes secretory inhibition as well) is a substance that dilates the bronchi and bronchioles, decreasing resistance in the respiratory airway and increasing airflow to the lungs. Bronchodilators may be originating naturally within the body, or they may be medications administered for the treatment of breathing difficulties, usually in the form of inhalers. They are most useful in obstructive lung diseases, of which asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most common conditions. They may be useful in bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis, although this remains somewhat controversial. They are often prescribed but of unproven significance in restrictive lung diseases.

Bronchodilators are either short-acting or long-acting. Short-acting medications provide quick or &quot;rescue&quot; relief from acute bronchoconstriction. Long-acting bronchodilators help to control and prevent symptoms. The three types of prescription bronchodilating drugs are beta-2 adrenergic agonists (short- and long-acting), anticholinergics (short- and long-acting), and theophylline (long-acting).

==Short-acting β2-adrenergic agonists==
These are quick-relief or &quot;rescue&quot; medications that provide quick, temporary relief from asthma symptoms or flare-ups. These medications usually take effect within 20 minutes or less, and can last from four to six hours. These inhaled medications are best for treating sudden and severe or new asthma symptoms. Taken 15 to 20 minutes ahead of time, these medications can also prevent asthma symptoms triggered by exercise or exposure to cold air. Some short-acting β-agonists, such as salbutamol, are specific to the lungs; they are called β2-adrenergic agonists and can relieve bronchospasms without unwanted cardiac side effects of nonspecific β-agonists (for example, ephedrine or epinephrine). Patients who regularly or frequently need to take a short-acting β2-adrenergic agonist should consult their doctor, as such usage indicates uncontrolled asthma, and their routine medications may need adjustment.

==Long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists==

These are long-term medications taken routinely in order to control and prevent bronchoconstriction. They are not intended for fast relief. These medications may take longer to begin working, but relieve airway constriction for up to 12 hours.
Commonly taken twice a day with an anti-inflammatory medication, they maintain open airways and prevent asthma symptoms, particularly at night.

Salmeterol and formoterol are examples of these.

==Anticholinergics==
Some examples of anticholinergics are tiotropium (Spiriva) and ipratropium bromide.

Tiotropium is a long-acting, 24-hour, anticholinergic bronchodilator used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Only available as an inhalant, ipratropium bromide is used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. As a short-acting anticholinergic, it improves lung function and reduces the risk of exacerbation in people with symptomatic asthma. However, it will not stop an asthma attack already in progress. Because it has no effect on asthma symptoms when used alone, it is most often paired with a short-acting β2-adrenergic agonist. While it is considered a relief or rescue medication, it can take a full hour to begin working. For this reason, it plays a secondary role in acute asthma treatment. Dry throat is the most common side effect. If the medication gets in contact with the eyes, it may cause blurred vision for a brief time.

The use of anticholinergics in combination with short-acting β2-adrenergic agonists has been shown to reduce hospital admissions in children and adults with acute asthma exacerbations.

==Other==
Available in oral and injectable form, theophylline is a long-acting bronchodilator that prevents asthma episodes. It belongs to the chemical class methylxanthines (along with caffeine). It is prescribed in severe cases of asthma or those that are difficult to control. It must be taken 1–4 times daily, and doses cannot be missed. Blood tests are required to monitor therapy and to indicate when dosage adjustment is necessary. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach or headache, rapid or irregular heart beat, muscle cramps, nervous or jittery feelings, and hyperactivity. These symptoms may signal the need for an adjustment in medication. It may promote acid reflux, also known as GERD, by relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter muscle. Some medications, such as seizure and ulcer medications and antibiotics containing erythromycin, can interfere with the way theophylline works. Coffee, tea, colas, cigarette-smoking, and viral illnesses can all affect the action of theophylline and change its effectiveness. A physician should monitor dosage levels to meet each patient&#x27;s profile and needs.

Additionally, some psychostimulant drugs that have an amphetamine like mode of action, such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine, have bronchodilating effects and were used often for asthma due to the lack of effective β2-adrenergic agonists for use as bronchodilator, but are now rarely, if ever, used medically for their bronchodilatory effects.

Gaseous carbon dioxide also relaxes airway musculature: hypocapnia caused by deliberate hyperventilation increases respiratory resistance while hypercapnia induced by carbon dioxide inhalation reduces it; however, this bronchodilating effect of carbon dioxide inhalation only lasts 4 to 5 minutes. Nonetheless, this observation has inspired the development of S-1226, carbon dioxide-enriched air formulated with nebulized perflubron.

==Common bronchodilators==
The bronchodilators are divided into short- and long-acting groups. Short-acting bronchodilators are used for relief of bronchoconstriction, while long-acting bronchodilators are predominantly used for prevention.

Short-acting bronchodilators include:
* Salbutamol/albuterol (Proventil or Ventolin)
* Levosalbutamol/levalbuterol (Xopenex)
* Pirbuterol (Maxair)
* Epinephrine (Primatene Mist)
* Racemic Epinephrine (Asthmanefrin, Primatene Mist Replacement)
* Ephedrine (Bronkaid)
* Terbutaline

Long-acting bronchodilators include:
* Salmeterol (Serevent or Seretide)
* Clenbuterol (Spiropent)
* Formoterol
* Bambuterol
* Indacaterol

<doc id="66390" wikidata="Q187695" url="?curid=66390" title="Sarin">
<text>Sarin (NATO designation GB [short for G-series, &quot;B&quot;]) is an extremely toxic organophosphorus compound. A colourless, odourless liquid, it is used as a chemical weapon due to its extreme potency as a nerve agent. Exposure can be lethal even at very low concentrations, where death can occur within one to ten minutes after direct inhalation of a lethal dose, due to suffocation from respiratory paralysis, unless antidotes are quickly administered. People who absorb a non-lethal dose and do not receive immediate medical treatment may suffer permanent neurological damage.

Sarin is widely considered a weapon of mass destruction. Production and stockpiling of sarin was outlawed as of April 1997 by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993, and it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance.

==Health effects==

Like some other nerve agents that affect the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, sarin attacks the nervous system by interfering with the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions. Death usually occurs as a result of asphyxia due to the inability to control the muscles involved in breathing.

Initial symptoms following exposure to sarin are a runny nose, tightness in the chest, and constriction of the pupils (miotic action). Soon after, the person will have difficulty breathing and experience nausea and drooling. This progresses to losing control of bodily functions, which may cause the person to vomit, defecate, and urinate. This phase is followed by twitching and jerking. Ultimately, the person becomes comatose and suffocates in a series of convulsive spasms. Common mnemonics for the symptomatology of organophosphate poisoning, including sarin, are the &quot;killer Bs&quot; of bronchorrhea and bronchospasm because they are the leading cause of death, and SLUDGE – salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal distress, and emesis (vomiting). Death may follow in one to ten minutes after direct inhalation, but may also occur after a delay ranging from hours to several weeks, in cases where exposure is limited but no antidote is applied.

Sarin has a high volatility (ease with which a liquid can turn into vapour) relative to similar nerve agents, making inhalation very easy, and may even absorb through the skin. A person&#x27;s clothing can release sarin for about 30 minutes after it has come in contact with sarin gas, which can lead to exposure of other people.

===Management===
Treatment measures have been described. Treatment is typically with the antidotes atropine and pralidoxime. Atropine, an antagonist to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, is given to treat the physiological symptoms of poisoning. Since muscular response to acetylcholine is mediated through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, atropine does not counteract the muscular symptoms. Pralidoxime can regenerate cholinesterases if administered within approximately five hours. Biperiden, a synthetic acetylcholine antagonist, has been suggested as an alternative to atropine due to its better blood–brain barrier penetration and higher efficacy.

===Mechanism of action===
Sarin is a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that degrades the neurotransmitter acetylcholine after it is released into the synaptic cleft. In vertebrates, acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction, where signals are transmitted between neurons from the peripheral nervous system to muscle fibres. Normally, acetylcholine is released from the neuron to stimulate the muscle, after which it is degraded by acetylcholinesterase, allowing the muscle to relax. A build-up of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, means the neurotransmitter continues to act on the muscle fibre, so that any nerve impulses are effectively continually transmitted.

Sarin acts on acetylcholinesterase by forming a covalent bond with the particular serine residue at the active site. Fluoride is the leaving group, and the resulting organo-phosphoester is robust and biologically inactive.

Its mechanism of action resembles that of some commonly used insecticides, such as malathion. In terms of biological activity, it resembles carbamate insecticides, such as Sevin, and the medicines pyridostigmine, neostigmine, and physostigmine.

===Diagnostic tests===
Controlled studies in healthy men have shown that a nontoxic 0.43 mg oral dose administered in several portions over a 3-day interval caused average maximum depressions of 22 and 30%, respectively, in plasma and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase levels. A single acute 0.5 mg dose caused mild symptoms of intoxication and an average reduction of 38% in both measures of acetylcholinesterase activity. Sarin in blood is rapidly degraded either &quot;in vivo&quot; or &quot;in vitro&quot;. Its primary inactive metabolites have &quot;in vivo&quot; serum half-lives of approximately 24 hours. The serum level of unbound isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA), a sarin hydrolysis product, ranged from 2–135 μg/L in survivors of a terrorist attack during the first four hours post-exposure. Sarin or its metabolites may be determined in blood or urine by gas or liquid chromatography, while acetylcholinesterase activity is usually measured by enzymatic methods.

A newer method called &quot;fluoride regeneration&quot; or &quot;fluoride reactivation&quot; detects the presence of nerve agents for a longer period after exposure than the methods described above. Fluoride reactivation is a technique that has been explored since at least the early 2000s. This technique obviates some of the deficiencies of older procedures. Sarin not only reacts with the water in the blood plasma through hydrolysis (forming so-called &#x27;free metabolites&#x27;), but also reacts with various proteins to form &#x27;protein adducts&#x27;. These protein adducts are not so easily removed from the body, and remain for a longer period of time than the free metabolites. One clear advantage of this process is that the period, post-exposure, for determination of sarin exposure is much longer, possibly five to eight weeks according to at least one study.

===Toxicity===
As a nerve gas, sarin in its purest form is estimated to be 26 times more deadly than cyanide. The LD50 of subcutaneously injected sarin in mice is 172 μg/kg.

Sarin is highly toxic, whether by contact with the skin or breathed in. The toxicity of sarin in humans is largely based on calculations from studies with animals. The lethal concentration of sarin in air is approximately 28–35 mg per cubic meter per minute for a two-minute exposure time by a healthy adult breathing normally (exchanging 15 liters of air per minute, lower 28 mg/m3 value is for general population). This number represents the estimated lethal concentration for 50% of exposed victims, the LCt50 value. The LCt95 or LCt100 value is estimated to be 40–83 mg per cubic meter for exposure time of two minutes. Calculating effects for different exposure times and concentrations requires following specific toxic load models. In general, brief exposures to higher concentrations are more lethal than comparable long time exposures to low concentrations. There are many ways to make relative comparisons between toxic substances. The list below compares sarin to some current and historic chemical warfare agents, with a direct comparison to the respiratory LCt50:

* Hydrogen cyanide, 2,860 mg/(min·m3) – Sarin is 81 times more lethal
* Phosgene, 1,500 mg/(min·m3) – Sarin is 43 times more lethal
* Sulfur mustard, 1,000 mg/(min·m3) – Sarin is 28 times more lethal
* Chlorine, 19,000 mg/(min·m3) – Sarin is 543 times more lethal

==Production and structure==
Sarin is a chiral molecule because it has four chemically distinct substituents attached to the tetrahedral phosphorus center. The &quot;SP &quot;form (the (–) optical isomer) is the more active enantiomer due to its greater binding affinity to acetylcholinesterase. The P-F bond is easily broken by nucleophilic agents, such as water and hydroxide. At high p&quot;H&quot;, sarin decomposes rapidly to nontoxic phosphonic acid derivatives.

It is almost always manufactured as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of its enantiomeric forms) as this involves a much simpler synthesis while providing an adequate weapon.

A number of production pathways can be used to create sarin. The final reaction typically involves attachment of the isopropoxy group to the phosphorus with an alcoholysis with isopropyl alcohol. Two variants of this final step are common. One is the reaction of methylphosphonyl difluoride with isopropyl alcohol, which produces a racemic mixture of sarin enantiomers with hydrofluoric acid as a byproduct:

The second process, known as the &quot;Di-Di&quot; process, uses equimolar quantities of methylphosphonyl difluoride (Difluoro) and methylphosphonyl dichloride (Dichloro). This reaction gives sarin, hydrochloric acid and others minors byproducts. The Di-Di process was used by the United States for the production of its unitary sarin stockpile.

The scheme below shows a generic example that employs the Di-Di method as the final esterification step; in reality, the selection of reagents and reaction conditions dictate both product structure and yield. The choice of enantiomer of the mixed chloro fluoro intermediate displayed in the diagram is arbitrary, but the final substitution is selective for chloro over fluoro as the leaving group. Inert atmosphere and anhydrous conditions (Schlenk techniques) are used for synthesis of sarin and other organophosphates.

As both reactions leave considerable acid in the product, sarin produced in bulk by these methods has a short half life without further processing, and would be corrosive to containers and damaging to weapons systems. Various methods have been tried to resolve these problems. In addition to industrial refining techniques to purify the chemical itself, various additives have been tried to combat the effects of the acid, such as:
* Tributylamine was added to US sarin produced at Rocky Mountain Arsenal.
* Triethylamine was added to UK sarin, with relatively poor success. The Aum Shinrikyo cult experimented with triethylamine as well.
* &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-Diethylaniline was used by Aum Shinrikyo for acid reduction.
* &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N′&quot;-Diisopropylcarbodimide was added to sarin produced at Rocky Mountain Arsenal to combat corrosion.
* Isopropylamine was included as part of the M687 155 mm field artillery shell, which was a binary sarin weapon system developed by the US Army.

Another byproduct of these two chemical processes is diisopropyl methylphosphonate, formed when a second isopropyl alcohol reacts with the sarin itself and from disproportionation of sarin, when distilled incorrectly. The factor of its formation in esterification is that as the concentration of DF-DCl decreases, the concentration of sarin increases, the probability of DIMP formation is greater. DIMP is a natural impurity of sarin, that is almost impossible to be eliminated, mathematically, when the reaction is a 1 mol-1 mol &quot;one-stream&quot;.

This chemical degrades into isopropyl methylphosphonic acid.

==Degradation and shelf life==
The most important chemical reactions of phosphoryl halides is the hydrolysis of the bond between phosphorus and the fluorine atom. This P-F bond is easily broken by nucleophilic agents, such as water and hydroxide. At high pH, sarin decomposes rapidly to nontoxic phosphonic acid derivatives. The initial breakdown of sarin is into isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA), a chemical that is not commonly found in nature except as a breakdown product of sarin (this is useful for detecting the recent deployment of sarin as a weapon). IMPA then degrades into methylphosphonic acid (MPA), which can also be produced by other organophosphates.

Sarin with residual acid degrades after a period of several weeks to several months. The shelf life can be shortened by impurities in precursor materials. According to the CIA, some Iraqi sarin had a shelf life of only a few weeks, owing mostly to impure precursors.

Along with nerve agents such as tabun and VX, sarin can have a short shelf life. Therefore, it is usually stored as two separate precursors that produce sarin when combined. Sarin&#x27;s shelf life can be extended by increasing the purity of the precursor and intermediates and incorporating stabilizers such as tributylamine. In some formulations, tributylamine is replaced by diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), allowing sarin to be stored in aluminium casings. In binary chemical weapons, the two precursors are stored separately in the same shell and mixed to form the agent immediately before or when the shell is in flight. This approach has the dual benefit of solving the stability issue and increasing the safety of sarin munitions.

==History==
Sarin was discovered in 1938 in Wuppertal-Elberfeld in Germany by scientists at IG Farben who were attempting to create stronger pesticides; it is the most toxic of the four G-Series nerve agents made by Germany. The compound, which followed the discovery of the nerve agent tabun, was named in honor of its discoverers: chemist Gerhard Schrader, chemist Otto Ambros, chemist , and from Heereswaffenamt Hans-Jürgen von der Linde.

===Use as a weapon===
In mid-1939, the formula for the agent was passed to the chemical warfare section of the German Army Weapons Office, which ordered that it be brought into mass production for wartime use. Pilot plants were built, and a production facility was under construction (but was not finished) by the end of World War II. Estimates for total sarin production by Nazi Germany range from 500 kg to 10 tons.

Though sarin, tabun, and soman were incorporated into artillery shells, Germany did not use nerve agents against Allied targets. Adolf Hitler refused to initiate the use of gases such as sarin as weapons.

* 1950s (early): NATO adopted sarin as a standard chemical weapon. The USSR and the United States produced sarin for military purposes.
* 1953: 20-year-old Ronald Maddison, a Royal Air Force engineer from Consett, County Durham, died in human testing of sarin at the Porton Down chemical warfare testing facility in Wiltshire, England. Ten days after his death an inquest was held in secret which returned a verdict of misadventure. In 2004, the inquest was reopened and, after a 64-day inquest hearing, the jury ruled that Maddison had been unlawfully killed by the &quot;application of a nerve agent in a non-therapeutic experiment&quot;.
* 1957: Regular production of sarin chemical weapons ceased in the United States, though existing stocks of bulk sarin were re-distilled until 1970.
* 1976: Chile&#x27;s intelligence service, DINA, assigned biochemist Eugenio Berríos to develop Sarin gas within its program &quot;Proyecto Andrea&quot;, to be used as a weapon against its opponents. One of DINA&#x27;s goals was to package it in spray cans for easy use, which, according to testimony by former DINA agent Michael Townley, was one of the planned procedures in the 1976 assassination of Orlando Letelier. Berríos later testified that it was used in a number of assassinations and it was planned to be used to kill inhabitants, through poisoning the water supply of Argentine capital Buenos Aires, in case Operation Soberanía took place.
* March 1988: Halabja chemical attack; Over two days in March, the ethnic Kurdish city of Halabja in northern Iraq (population 70,000) was bombarded by Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraqi Air Force jets with chemical bombs including sarin. An estimated 5,000 people died, almost all civilians.
* April 1988: Iraq used Sarin four times against Iranian soldiers at the end of the Iran–Iraq War, helping Iraqi forces to retake control of the al-Faw Peninsula during the Second Battle of al-Faw.
* 1993: The United Nations Chemical Weapons Convention was signed by 162 member countries, banning the production and stockpiling of many chemical weapons, including sarin. It went into effect on April 29, 1997, and called for the complete destruction of all specified stockpiles of chemical weapons by April 2007. When the convention entered force, the parties declared worldwide stockpiles of 15,047 tonnes of sarin. As of November 28, 2019, 98% of the stockpiles have been destroyed.
* 1994: Matsumoto incident; the Japanese religious sect Aum Shinrikyo released an impure form of sarin in Matsumoto, Nagano, killing eight people and harming over 500. The Australian sheep station Banjawarn was a testing ground.
* 1995: Tokyo subway sarin attack; the Aum Shinrikyo sect released an impure form of sarin in the Tokyo Metro. Twelve people died, and over 6,200 people received injuries.
* 2002: Pro-Chechen militant Ibn al-Khattab may have been assassinated with sarin by the Russian government.
* May 2004: Iraqi insurgents detonated a 155 mm shell containing binary precursors for sarin near a U.S. convoy in Iraq. The shell was designed to mix the chemicals as it spun during flight. The detonated shell released only a small amount of sarin gas, either because the explosion failed to mix the binary agents properly or because the chemicals inside the shell had degraded with age. Two United States soldiers were treated after displaying the early symptoms of exposure to sarin.
* March 2013: Khan al-Assal chemical attack; Sarin was used in an attack on a town west of Aleppo city in Syria, killing 28 and wounding 124.
* August 2013: Ghouta chemical attack; Sarin was used in multiple simultaneous attacks in the Ghouta region of the Rif Dimashq Governorate of Syria during the Syrian Civil War. Varying sources gave a death toll of 322 to 1,729.
* April 2017: Khan Shaykhun chemical attack: The Syrian Air Force released sarin gas in rebel-held Idlib Province in Syria during an airstrike.
* April 2018: Victims of the Douma chemical attack in Syria reported to have symptoms consistent with exposure to sarin and other agents. On July 6, 2018, the Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) of the OPCW published their interim report. The report stated that, &quot;The results show that no organophosphorous [sarin] nerve agents or their degradation products were detected in the environmental samples or in the plasma samples taken from alleged casualties&quot;. The chemical agent used in the attack was later identified as elemental chlorine.
* July 2023: The U.S. destroyed the last of its declared chemical weapons, a sarin nerve agent-filled M55 rocket, on July 7, 2023.

<text>Stimulants (also known as central nervous system stimulants, or psychostimulants, or colloquially as uppers) are a class of drugs that increase alertness. They are used for various purposes, such as enhancing attention, motivation, cognition, mood, and physical performance. Some stimulants occur naturally, while others are exclusively synthetic. Common stimulants include caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, cocaine, methylphenidate, and modafinil. Stimulants may be subject to varying forms of regulation, or outright prohibition, depending on jurisdiction.

Stimulants increase activity in the sympathetic nervous system, either directly or indirectly. Prototypical stimulants increase synaptic concentrations of excitatory neurotransmitters, particularly norepinephrine and dopamine (e.g., methylphenidate). Other stimulants work by binding to the receptors of excitatory neurotransmitters (e.g., nicotine) or by blocking the activity of endogenous agents that promote sleep (e.g., caffeine). Stimulants can affect various functions, including arousal, attention, the reward system, learning, memory, and emotion. Effects range from mild stimulation to euphoria, depending on the specific drug, dose, route of administration, and inter-individual characteristics. 

Stimulants have a long history of use, both for medical and non-medical purposes. Archeological evidence from Peru shows that cocaine use dates back as far as 8000 B.C.E. Stimulants have been used to treat various conditions, such as narcolepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obesity, depression, and fatigue. They have also been used as recreational drugs, performance-enhancing substances, and cognitive enhancers, by various groups of people, such as students, athletes, artists, and workers. They have also been used to promote aggression of combatants in wartime, both historically and in the present day.

Stimulants have potential risks and side effects, such as addiction, tolerance, withdrawal, psychosis, anxiety, insomnia, cardiovascular problems, and neurotoxicity. The misuse and abuse of stimulants can lead to serious health and social consequences, such as overdose, dependence, crime, and violence. Therefore, the use of stimulants is regulated by laws and policies in most countries, and requires medical supervision and prescription in some cases.

== Definition ==
A &quot;stimulant&quot; is an overarching term that covers many drugs including those that increase the activity of the central nervous system and the body, drugs that are pleasurable and invigorating, or drugs that have sympathomimetic effects. Sympathomimetic effects are those effects that mimic or copy the actions of the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is a part of the nervous system that prepares the body for action, such as increasing the heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Stimulants can activate the same receptors as the natural chemicals released by the sympathetic nervous system (namely epinephrine and norepinephrine) and cause similar effects.

== Effects ==
===Acute===
Stimulants in therapeutic doses, such as those given to patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), increase ability to focus, vigor, sociability, libido and may elevate mood. However, in higher doses, stimulants may actually decrease the ability to focus, a principle of the Yerkes-Dodson Law. In higher doses, stimulants may also produce euphoria, vigor, and a decreased need for sleep.

Many, but not all, stimulants have ergogenic effects; that is, they enhance physical performance. Drugs such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, amphetamine and methylphenidate have well documented ergogenic effects, while cocaine has the opposite effect.

Neurocognitive enhancing effects of stimulants, specifically modafinil, amphetamine and methylphenidate have been reported in healthy adolescents by some studies, and is a commonly cited reason among illicit drug users for use, particularly among college students in the context of studying. Still, results of these studies is inconclusive: assessing the potential overall neurocognitive benefits of stimulants among healthy youth is challenging due to the diversity within the population, the variability in cognitive task characteristics, and the absence of replication of studies. Research on the cognitive enhancement effects of modafinil in healthy non-sleep-deprived individuals has yielded mixed results, with some studies suggesting modest improvements in attention and executive functions while others show no significant benefits or even a decline in cognitive functions.

In some cases, psychiatric phenomena may emerge such as stimulant psychosis, paranoia, and suicidal ideation. Acute toxicity has been reportedly associated with hyperhydrosis, panic attacks, severe anxiety, mydriasis, paranoia, aggressive behavior, excessive motor activity, psychosis, rhabdomyolysis, and punding. The violent and aggressive behavior associated with acute stimulant toxicity may partially be driven by paranoia. Most drugs classified as stimulants are sympathomimetic, meaning that they stimulate the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. This leads to effects such as mydriasis (dilation of the pupils), increased heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and body temperature. When these changes become pathological, they are called arrhythmia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, and may lead to rhabdomyolysis, stroke, cardiac arrest, or seizures. However, given the complexity of the mechanisms that underlie these potentially fatal outcomes of acute stimulant toxicity, it is impossible to determine what dose may be lethal.

===Chronic===
Assessment of the effects of stimulants is relevant given the large population currently taking stimulants. A systematic review of cardiovascular effects of prescription stimulants found no association in children, but found a correlation between prescription stimulant use and ischemic heart attacks. A review over a four-year period found that there were few negative effects of stimulant treatment, but stressed the need for longer-term studies. A review of a year long period of prescription stimulant use in those with ADHD found that cardiovascular side effects were limited to transient increases in blood pressure only. However, a 2024 systematic review of the evidence found that stimulants overall improve ADHD symptoms and broadband behavioral measures in children and adolescents, though they carry risks of side effects like appetite suppression and other adverse events. Initiation of stimulant treatment in those with ADHD in early childhood appears to carry benefits into adulthood with regard to social and cognitive functioning, and appears to be relatively safe.

Abuse of prescription stimulants (not following physician instruction) or of illicit stimulants carries many negative health risks. Abuse of cocaine, depending upon route of administration, increases risk of cardiorespiratory disease, stroke, and sepsis. Some effects are dependent upon the route of administration, with intravenous use associated with the transmission of many disease such as Hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS and potential medical emergencies such as infection, thrombosis or pseudoaneurysm, while inhalation may be associated with increased lower respiratory tract infection, lung cancer, and pathological restricting of lung tissue. Cocaine may also increase risk for autoimmune disease and damage nasal cartilage. Abuse of methamphetamine produces similar effects as well as marked degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, resulting in an increased risk for Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

== Medical uses ==
Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines as well as without a prescription (either legally or illicitly) as performance-enhancing or recreational drugs. Among narcotics, stimulants produce a noticeable crash or &quot;comedown&quot; at the end of their effects. In the US, the most frequently prescribed stimulants as of 2013 were lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and amphetamine (Adderall). It was estimated in 2015 that the percentage of the world population that had used cocaine during a year was 0.4%. For the category &quot;amphetamines and prescription stimulants&quot; (with &quot;amphetamines&quot; including amphetamine and methamphetamine) the value was 0.7%, and for MDMA 0.4%.

Stimulants have been used in medicine for many conditions including obesity, sleep disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, asthma, nasal congestion and, in case of cocaine, as local anesthetics. Drugs used to treat obesity are called anorectics and generally include drugs that follow the general definition of a stimulant, but other drugs such as cannabinoid receptor antagonists also belong to this group. Eugeroics are used in management of sleep disorders characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, such as narcolepsy, and include stimulants such as modafinil and pitolisant. Stimulants are used in impulse control disorders such as ADHD and off-label in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder to increase energy, focus and elevate mood. Stimulants such as epinephrine, theophylline and salbutamol orally have been used to treat asthma, but inhaled adrenergic drugs are now preferred due to less systemic side effects. Pseudoephedrine is used to relieve nasal or sinus congestion caused by the common cold, sinusitis, hay fever and other respiratory allergies; it is also used to relieve ear congestion caused by ear inflammation or infection.

===Depression===
Stimulants were one of the first classes of drugs to be used in the treatment of depression, beginning after the introduction of the amphetamines in the 1930s. However, they were largely abandoned for treatment of depression following the introduction of conventional antidepressants in the 1950s. Subsequent to this, there has been a resurgence in interest in stimulants for depression in recent years.

Stimulants produce a fast-acting and pronounced but transient and short-lived mood lift. In relation to this, they are minimally effective in the treatment of depression when administered continuously. In addition, tolerance to the mood-lifting effects of amphetamine has led to dose escalation and dependence. Although the efficacy for depression with continuous administration is modest, it may still reach statistical significance over placebo and provide benefits similar in magnitude to those of conventional antidepressants. The reasons for the short-term mood-improving effects of stimulants are unclear, but may relate to rapid tolerance. Tolerance to the effects of stimulants has been studied and characterized both in animals and humans. Stimulant withdrawal is remarkably similar in its symptoms to those of major depressive disorder.

== Chemistry ==
Classifying stimulants is difficult, because of the large number of classes the drugs occupy, and the fact that they may belong to multiple classes; for example, ecstasy can be classified as a substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine, a substituted amphetamine and consequently, a substituted phenethylamine.

Major stimulant classes include phenethylamines and their daughter class substituted amphetamines.

=== Amphetamines (class) ===
Substituted amphetamines are a class of compounds based upon the amphetamine structure; it includes all derivative compounds which are formed by replacing, or substituting, one or more hydrogen atoms in the amphetamine core structure with substituents. Examples of substituted amphetamines are amphetamine (itself), methamphetamine, ephedrine, cathinone, phentermine, mephentermine, bupropion, methoxyphenamine, selegiline, amfepramone, pyrovalerone, MDMA (ecstasy), and DOM (STP). Many drugs in this class work primarily by activating trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1); in turn, this causes reuptake inhibition and effluxion, or release, of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. An additional mechanism of some substituted amphetamines is the release of vesicular stores of monoamine neurotransmitters through VMAT2, thereby increasing the concentration of these neurotransmitters in the cytosol, or intracellular fluid, of the presynaptic neuron.

Amphetamine-type stimulants are often used for their therapeutic effects. Physicians sometimes prescribe amphetamine to treat major depressive disorder, where subjects do not respond well to traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications, but evidence supporting this use is mixed. Two large phase III studies of lisdexamfetamine (a prodrug to amphetamine) as an adjunct to an SSRI or serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) in the treatment of major depressive disorder showed no further benefit relative to placebo in effectiveness. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of drugs like Adderall (a mixture of salts of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) in controlling symptoms associated with ADHD. Non-stimulants such as atomoxetine have also found to be effective. Due to their availability and fast-acting effects, substituted amphetamines are prime candidates for abuse.

===Cocaine analogs===
Hundreds of cocaine analogs have been created, all of them usually maintaining a benzyloxy connected to the 3 carbon of a tropane. Various modifications include substitutions on the benzene ring, as well as additions or substitutions in place of the normal carboxylate on the tropane 2 carbon. Various compound with similar structure activity relationships to cocaine that aren&#x27;t technically analogs have been developed as well.

==Mechanisms of action==
Most stimulants exert their activating effects by enhancing catecholamine neurotransmission. Catecholamine neurotransmitters are employed in regulatory pathways implicated in attention, arousal, motivation, task salience and reward anticipation. Classical stimulants either block the reuptake or stimulate the efflux of these catecholamines, resulting in increased activity of their circuits. Some stimulants, specifically those with empathogenic and hallucinogenic effects, also affect serotonergic transmission. Some stimulants, such as some amphetamine derivatives and, notably, yohimbine, can decrease negative feedback by antagonizing regulatory autoreceptors. Adrenergic agonists, such as, in part, ephedrine, act by directly binding to and activating adrenergic receptors, producing sympathomimetic effects. 

There are also more indirect mechanisms of action by which a drug can elicit activating effects. Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist, and only indirectly increases catecholamine transmission in the brain. Pitolisant is an histamine 3 (H3)-receptor inverse agonist. As histamine 3 (H3) receptors mainly act as autoreceptors, pitolisant decreases negative feedback to histaminergic neurons, enhancing histaminergic transmission.

The precise mechanism of action of some stimulants, such as modafinil, for treating symptoms of narcolepsy and other sleep disorders, remains unknown.

== Notable stimulants ==
=== Amphetamine ===
Amphetamine is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the phenethylamine class that is approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Amphetamine is also used off-label as a performance and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. Although it is a prescription medication in many countries, unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine is often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with uncontrolled or heavy use. As a consequence, amphetamine is illegally manufactured in clandestine labs to be trafficked and sold to users. Based upon drug and drug precursor seizures worldwide, illicit amphetamine production and trafficking is much less prevalent than that of methamphetamine.

The first pharmaceutical amphetamine was Benzedrine, a brand of inhalers used to treat a variety of conditions. Because the dextrorotary isomer has greater stimulant properties, Benzedrine was gradually discontinued in favor of formulations containing all or mostly dextroamphetamine. Presently, it is typically prescribed as mixed amphetamine salts, dextroamphetamine, and lisdexamfetamine.

Amphetamine is a norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent (NDRA). It enters neurons through dopamine and norepinephrine transporters and facilitates neurotransmitter efflux by activating TAAR1 and inhibiting VMAT2. At therapeutic doses, this causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in libido, increased arousal, and improved cognitive control. Likewise, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, supratherapeutic doses of amphetamine are likely to impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia), which very rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. As recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, recreational use carries a far greater risk of serious side effects, such as dependence, which only rarely arises with therapeutic amphetamine use.

=== Caffeine ===

Caffeine is a stimulant compound belonging to the xanthine class of chemicals naturally found in coffee, tea, and (to a lesser degree) cocoa or chocolate. It is included in many soft drinks, as well as a larger amount in energy drinks. Caffeine is the world&#x27;s most widely used psychoactive drug and by far the most common stimulant. In North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.

A few jurisdictions restrict the sale and use of caffeine. In the United States, the FDA has banned the sale of pure and highly concentrated caffeine products for personal consumption, due to the risk of overdose and death. The Australian Government has announced a ban on the sale of pure and highly concentrated caffeine food products for personal consumption, following the death of a young man from acute caffeine toxicity. In Canada, Health Canada has proposed to limit the amount of caffeine in energy drinks to 180 mg per serving, and to require warning labels and other safety measures on these products.

Caffeine is also included in some medications, usually for the purpose of enhancing the effect of the primary ingredient, or reducing one of its side-effects (especially drowsiness). Tablets containing standardized doses of caffeine are also widely available.

Caffeine&#x27;s mechanism of action differs from many stimulants, as it produces stimulant effects by inhibiting adenosine receptors. Adenosine receptors are thought to be a large driver of drowsiness and sleep, and their action increases with extended wakefulness. Caffeine has been found to increase striatal dopamine in animal models, as well as inhibit the inhibitory effect of adenosine receptors on dopamine receptors, however the implications for humans are unknown. Unlike most stimulants, caffeine has no addictive potential. Caffeine does not appear to be a reinforcing stimulus, and some degree of aversion may actually occur, per a study on drug abuse liability published in an NIDA research monograph that described a group preferring placebo over caffeine. In large telephone surveys only 11% reported dependence symptoms. However, when people were tested in labs, only half of those who claim dependence actually experienced it, casting doubt on caffeine&#x27;s ability to produce dependence and putting societal pressures in the spotlight.

Coffee consumption is associated with a lower overall risk of cancer. This is primarily due to a decrease in the risks of hepatocellular and endometrial cancer, but it may also have a modest effect on colorectal cancer. There does not appear to be a significant protective effect against other types of cancers, and heavy coffee consumption may increase the risk of bladder cancer. A protective effect of caffeine against Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is possible, but the evidence is inconclusive. Moderate coffee consumption may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, and it may somewhat reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Drinking 1-3 cups of coffee per day does not affect the risk of hypertension compared to drinking little or no coffee. However those who drink 2–4 cups per day may be at a slightly increased risk. Caffeine increases intraocular pressure in those with glaucoma but does not appear to affect normal individuals. It may protect people from liver cirrhosis. There is no evidence that coffee stunts a child&#x27;s growth. Caffeine may increase the effectiveness of some medications including ones used to treat headaches. Caffeine may lessen the severity of acute mountain sickness if taken a few hours prior to attaining a high altitude.

=== Ephedrine ===

Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic amine similar in molecular structure to the well-known drugs phenylpropanolamine and methamphetamine, as well as to the important neurotransmitter epinephrine (adrenaline). Ephedrine is commonly used as a stimulant, appetite suppressant, concentration aid, and decongestant, and to treat hypotension associated with anesthesia.

In chemical terms, it is an alkaloid with a phenethylamine skeleton found in various plants in the genus &quot;Ephedra&quot; (family Ephedraceae). It works mainly by increasing the activity of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) on adrenergic receptors. It is most usually marketed as the &quot;hydrochloride&quot; or &quot;sulfate&quot; salt.

The herb &quot;má huáng&quot; (&quot;Ephedra sinica&quot;), used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), contains ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as its principal active constituents. The same may be true of other herbal products containing extracts from other &quot;Ephedra&quot; species.

=== MDMA ===


3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy, or molly) is a euphoriant, empathogen, and stimulant of the amphetamine class. Briefly used by some psychotherapists as an adjunct to therapy, the drug became popular recreationally and the DEA listed MDMA as a Schedule I controlled substance, prohibiting most medical studies and applications. MDMA is known for its entactogenic properties. The stimulant effects of MDMA include hypertension, anorexia (appetite loss), euphoria, social disinhibition, insomnia (enhanced wakefulness/inability to sleep), improved energy, increased arousal, and increased perspiration, among others. Relative to catecholaminergic transmission, MDMA enhances serotonergic transmission significantly more, when compared to classical stimulants like amphetamine. MDMA does not appear to be significantly addictive or dependence forming.

Due to the relative safety of MDMA, some researchers such as David Nutt have criticized the scheduling level, writing a satirical article finding MDMA to be 28 times less dangerous than horseriding, a condition he termed &quot;equasy&quot; or &quot;Equine Addiction Syndrome&quot;.

=== MDPV ===
Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is a psychoactive drug with stimulant properties that acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It was first developed in the 1960s by a team at Boehringer Ingelheim. MDPV remained an obscure stimulant until around 2004, when it was reported to be sold as a designer drug. Products labeled as bath salts containing MDPV were previously sold as recreational drugs in gas stations and convenience stores in the United States, similar to the marketing for Spice and K2 as incense.

Incidents of psychological and physical harm have been attributed to MDPV use.

=== Mephedrone ===
Mephedrone is a synthetic stimulant drug of the amphetamine and cathinone classes. Slang names include drone and MCAT. It is reported to be manufactured in China and is chemically similar to the cathinone compounds found in the khat plant of eastern Africa. It comes in the form of tablets or a powder, which users can swallow, snort, or inject, producing similar effects to MDMA, amphetamines, and cocaine.

Mephedrone was first synthesized in 1929, but did not become widely known until it was rediscovered in 2003. By 2007, mephedrone was reported to be available for sale on the Internet; by 2008 law enforcement agencies had become aware of the compound; and, by 2010, it had been reported in most of Europe, becoming particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom. Mephedrone was first made illegal in Israel in 2008, followed by Sweden later that year. In 2010, it was made illegal in many European countries, and, in December 2010, the EU ruled it illegal. In Australia, New Zealand, and the US, it is considered an analog of other illegal drugs and can be controlled by laws similar to the Federal Analog Act. In September 2011, the USA temporarily classified mephedrone as illegal, in effect from October 2011.

Mephedrone is neurotoxic and has abuse potential, predominantly exerted on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) terminals, mimicking that of MDMA with which it shares the same subjective sensations on abusers.

=== Methamphetamine ===
Methamphetamine (contracted from ) is a potent psychostimulant of the phenethylamine and amphetamine classes that is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity. Methamphetamine exists as two enantiomers, dextrorotary and levorotary. Dextromethamphetamine is a stronger CNS stimulant than levomethamphetamine; however, both are addictive and produce the same toxicity symptoms at high doses. Although rarely prescribed due to the potential risks, methamphetamine hydrochloride is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) under the trade name &quot;Desoxyn&quot;. Recreationally, methamphetamine is used to increase sexual desire, lift the mood, and increase energy, allowing some users to engage in sexual activity continuously for several days straight.

Methamphetamine may be sold illicitly, either as pure dextromethamphetamine or in an equal parts mixture of the right- and left-handed molecules (i.e., 50% levomethamphetamine and 50% dextromethamphetamine). Both dextromethamphetamine and racemic methamphetamine are schedule II controlled substances in the United States. Also, the production, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or illegal in many other countries due to its placement in schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty. In contrast, levomethamphetamine is an over-the-counter drug in the United States.

In low doses, methamphetamine can cause an elevated mood and increase alertness, concentration, and energy in fatigued individuals. At higher doses, it can induce psychosis, rhabdomyolysis, and cerebral hemorrhage. Methamphetamine is known to have a high potential for abuse and addiction. Recreational use of methamphetamine may result in psychosis or lead to post-withdrawal syndrome, a withdrawal syndrome that can persist for months beyond the typical withdrawal period. Unlike amphetamine and cocaine, methamphetamine is neurotoxic to humans, damaging both dopamine and serotonin neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Unlike the long-term use of amphetamine in prescription doses, which may improve certain brain regions in individuals with ADHD, there is evidence that methamphetamine causes brain damage from long-term use in humans; this damage includes adverse changes in brain structure and function, such as reductions in gray matter volume in several brain regions and adverse changes in markers of metabolic integrity. However, recreational amphetamine doses may also be neurotoxic.

=== Methylphenidate ===

Methylphenidate is a stimulant drug that is often used in the treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy and occasionally to treat obesity in combination with diet restraints and exercise. Its effects at therapeutic doses include increased focus, increased alertness, decreased appetite, decreased need for sleep and decreased impulsivity. Methylphenidate is not usually used recreationally, but when it is used, its effects are very similar to those of amphetamines.

Methylphenidate acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), by blocking the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT). Methylphenidate has a higher affinity for the dopamine transporter than for the norepinephrine transporter, and so its effects are mainly due to elevated dopamine levels caused by the inhibited reuptake of dopamine, however increased norepinephrine levels also contribute to various of the effects caused by the drug.

Methylphenidate is sold under a number of brand names including Ritalin. Other versions include the long lasting tablet Concerta and the long lasting transdermal patch Daytrana.

=== Cocaine ===
Cocaine is an SNDRI. Cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca shrub, which grows in the mountain regions of South American countries such as Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru, regions in which it was cultivated and used for centuries mainly by the Aymara people. In Europe, North America, and some parts of Asia, the most common form of cocaine is a white crystalline powder. Cocaine is a stimulant but is not normally prescribed therapeutically for its stimulant properties, although it sees clinical use as a local anesthetic, in particular in ophthalmology. Most cocaine use is recreational and its abuse potential is high (higher than amphetamine), and so its sale and possession are strictly controlled in most jurisdictions. Other tropane derivative drugs related to cocaine are also known such as troparil and lometopane but have not been widely sold or used recreationally.

=== Nicotine ===
Nicotine is the active chemical constituent in tobacco, which is available in many forms, including cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and smoking cessation aids such as nicotine patches, nicotine gum, and electronic cigarettes. Nicotine is used widely throughout the world for its stimulating and relaxing effects. Nicotine exerts its effects through the agonism of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in multiple downstream effects such as increase in activity of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain reward system, and acetaldehyde one of the tobacco constituent decreased the expression of monoamine oxidase in the brain. Nicotine is addictive and dependence forming. Tobacco, the most common source of nicotine, has an overall harm to user and self score 3 percent below cocaine, and 13 percent above amphetamines, ranking 6th most harmful of the 20 drugs assessed, as determined by a multi-criteria decision analysis.

=== Phenylpropanolamine ===

Phenylpropanolamine (PPA; Accutrim; β-hydroxyamphetamine), also known as the stereoisomers norephedrine and norpseudoephedrine, is a psychoactive drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes that is used as a stimulant, decongestant, and anorectic agent. It is commonly used in prescription and over-the-counter cough and cold preparations. In veterinary medicine, it is used to control urinary incontinence in dogs under trade names Propalin and Proin.

In the United States, PPA is no longer sold without a prescription due to a possible increased risk of stroke in younger women. In a few countries in Europe, however, it is still available either by prescription or sometimes over-the-counter. In Canada, it was withdrawn from the market on 31 May 2001. In India, human use of PPA and its formulations were banned on 10 February 2011.

=== Lisdexamfetamine ===
Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse, etc.) is an amphetamine-type medication, sold for use in treating ADHD. Its effects typically last around 14 hours. Lisdexamfetamine is inactive on its own and is metabolized into dextroamphetamine in the body. Consequently, it has a lower abuse potential.

=== Pseudoephedrine ===
Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. It may be used as a nasal/sinus decongestant, as a stimulant, or as a wakefulness-promoting agent.

The salts pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine sulfate are found in many over-the-counter preparations, either as a single ingredient or (more commonly) in combination with antihistamines, guaifenesin, dextromethorphan, and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) or another NSAID (such as aspirin or ibuprofen). It is also used as a precursor chemical in the illegal production of methamphetamine.

=== &quot;Catha edulis&quot; (Khat) ===

Khat is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.

Khat contains a monoamine alkaloid called cathinone, a &quot;keto-amphetamine&quot;. This alkaloid causes excitement, loss of appetite, and euphoria. In 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified it as a drug of abuse that can produce mild to moderate psychological dependence (less than tobacco or alcohol), although the WHO does not consider khat to be seriously addictive. It is banned in some countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Germany, while its production, sale, and consumption are legal in other countries, including Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Yemen.

===Modafinil===

Modafinil is an eugeroic medication, which means that it promotes wakefulness and alertness. Modafinil is sold under the brand name Provigil among others. Modafinil is used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness due to narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, or obstructive sleep apnea. While it has seen off-label use as a purported cognitive enhancer, the research on its effectiveness for this use is not conclusive. Despite being a CNS stimulant, the addiction and dependence liabilities of modafinil are considered very low. Although modafinil shares biochemical mechanisms with stimulant drugs, it is less likely to have mood-elevating properties. The similarities in effects with caffeine are not clearly established. Unlike other stimulants, modafinil does not induce a subjective feeling of pleasure or reward, which is commonly associated with euphoria, an intense feeling of well-being. Euphoria is a potential indicator of drug abuse, which is the compulsive and excessive use of a substance despite adverse consequences. In clinical trials, modafinil has shown no evidence of abuse potential, that is why modafinil is considered to have a low risk of addiction and dependence, however, caution is advised.

===Pitolisant===
Pitolisant is an inverse agonist (antagonist) of the histamine 3 (H3) autoreceptor. As such, pitolisant is an antihistamine medication that also belongs to the class of CNS stimulants. Pitolisant is also considered a medication of eugeroic class, which means that it promotes wakefulness and alertness. Pitolisant is the first wakefulness-promoting agent that acts by blocking the H3 autoreceptor.

Pitolisant has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy.

Pitolisant is the only non-controlled anti-narcoleptic drug in the US. It has shown minimal abuse risk in studies.

Blocking the histamine 3 (H3) autoreceptor increases the activity of histamine neurons in the brain. The H3 autoreceptors regulate histaminergic activity in the central nervous system (and to a lesser extent, the peripheral nervous system) by inhibiting histamine biosynthesis and release upon binding to endogenous histamine. By preventing the binding of endogenous histamine at the H3, as well as producing a response opposite to that of endogenous histamine at the receptor (inverse agonism), pitolisant enhances histaminergic activity in the brain.

== Recreational use and issues of abuse ==

Stimulants enhance the activity of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Common effects may include increased alertness, awareness, wakefulness, endurance, productivity, and motivation, arousal, locomotion, heart rate, and blood pressure, and a diminished desire for food and sleep. Use of stimulants may cause the body to reduce significantly its production of natural body chemicals that fulfill similar functions. Until the body reestablishes its normal state, once the effect of the ingested stimulant has worn off the user may feel depressed, lethargic, confused, and miserable. This is referred to as a &quot;crash&quot;, and may provoke reuse of the stimulant.

Abuse of central nervous system (CNS) stimulants is common. Addiction to some CNS stimulants can quickly lead to medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial deterioration. Drug tolerance, dependence, and sensitization as well as a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Stimulants may be screened for in animal discrimination and self-administration models which have high sensitivity albeit low specificity. Research on a progressive ratio self-administration protocol has found amphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil, cocaine, and nicotine to all have a higher break point than placebo that scales with dose indicating reinforcing effects. A progressive ratio self-administration protocol is a way of testing how much an animal or a human wants a drug by making them do a certain action (like pressing a lever or poking a nose device) to get the drug. The number of actions needed to get the drug increases every time, so it becomes harder and harder to get the drug. The highest number of actions that the animal or human is willing to do to get the drug is called the break point. The higher the break point, the more the animal or human wants the drug. In contrast to the classical stimulants such as amphetamine, the effects of modafinil depend on what the animals or humans have to do after getting the drug. If they have to do a performance task, like solving a puzzle or remembering something, modafinil makes them work harder for it than placebo, and the subjects wanted to self-administer modafinil. But if they had to do a relaxation task, like listening to music or watching a video, the subjects did not want to self-administer modafinil. This suggests that modafinil is more rewarding when it helps the animals or humans do something better or faster, especially considering that modafinil is not commonly abused or depended on by people, unlike other stimulants.

==Treatment for misuse==
Psychosocial treatments, such as contingency management, have demonstrated improved effectiveness when added to treatment as usual consisting of counseling and/or case-management. This is demonstrated with a decrease in dropout rates and a lengthening of periods of abstinence.

== Testing ==
The presence of stimulants in the body may be tested by a variety of procedures. Serum and urine are the common sources of testing material although saliva is sometimes used. Commonly used tests include chromatography, immunologic assay, and mass spectrometry.

<text>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency procedure consisting of chest compressions often combined with artificial ventilation, or mouth-to-mouth in an effort to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest. It is recommended for those who are unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal breathing, for example, agonal respirations.

CPR involves chest compressions for adults between and deep and at a rate of at least 100 to 120 per minute. The rescuer may also provide artificial ventilation by either exhaling air into the subject&#x27;s mouth or nose (mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) or using a device that pushes air into the subject&#x27;s lungs (mechanical ventilation). Current recommendations emphasize early and high-quality chest compressions over artificial ventilation; a simplified CPR method involving only chest compressions is recommended for untrained rescuers. With children, however, 2015 American Heart Association guidelines indicate that doing only compressions may result in worse outcomes, because such problems in children normally arise from respiratory issues rather than from cardiac ones, given their young age. Chest compression to breathing ratios are set at 30 to 2 in adults.

CPR alone is unlikely to restart the heart. Its main purpose is to restore the partial flow of oxygenated blood to the brain and heart. The objective is to delay tissue death and to extend the brief window of opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent brain damage. Administration of an electric shock to the subject&#x27;s heart, termed defibrillation, is usually needed to restore a viable, or &quot;perfusing&quot;, heart rhythm. Defibrillation is effective only for certain heart rhythms, namely ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, rather than asystole or pulseless electrical activity, which usually requires the treatment of underlying conditions to restore cardiac function. Early shock, when appropriate, is recommended. CPR may succeed in inducing a heart rhythm that may be shockable. In general, CPR is continued until the person has a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or is declared dead.
== Medical uses ==
CPR is indicated for any person unresponsive with no breathing or breathing only in occasional agonal gasps, as it is most likely that they are in cardiac arrest. If a person still has a pulse but is not breathing (respiratory arrest), artificial ventilations may be more appropriate, but due to the difficulty people have in accurately assessing the presence or absence of a pulse, CPR guidelines recommend that lay persons should not be instructed to check the pulse while giving healthcare professionals the option to check a pulse. In those with cardiac arrest due to trauma, CPR is considered futile but still recommended. Correcting the underlying cause such as a tension pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade may help.

== Pathophysiology ==
CPR is used on people in cardiac arrest to oxygenate the blood and maintain a cardiac output to keep vital organs alive. Blood circulation and oxygenation are required to transport oxygen to the tissues. The physiology of CPR involves generating a pressure gradient between the arterial and venous vascular beds; CPR achieves this via multiple mechanisms. 

The brain may sustain damage after blood flow has been stopped for about four minutes and irreversible damage after about seven minutes. Typically if blood flow ceases for one to two hours, then body cells die. Therefore, in general, CPR is effective only if performed within seven minutes of the stoppage of blood flow. The heart also rapidly loses the ability to maintain a normal rhythm. Low body temperatures, as sometimes seen in near-drownings, prolong the time the brain survives.

Following cardiac arrest, effective CPR enables enough oxygen to reach the brain to delay brain stem death and allows the heart to remain responsive to defibrillation attempts. If an incorrect compression rate is used during CPR, going against standing American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines of 100–120 compressions per minute, this can cause a net decrease in venous return of blood, for what is required, to fill the heart. For example, if a compression rate of above 120 compressions per minute is used consistently throughout the entire CPR process, this error could adversely affect survival rates and outcomes for the victim.

== Order of CPR in a first aid sequence ==
The best position for CPR maneuvers in the sequence of first aid reactions to a cardiac arrest is a question that has been long studied.

As a general reference, the recommended order (according to the guidelines of many related associations such as AHA and Red Cross) is:

# Asking for help from bystanders in case any of them have received first aid training or can perform additional tasks.
#* Variation: when the rescuer is alone and no phone is nearby, the rescuer would go first for a phone to call for emergency medical services (only if the rescuer can return in very few minutes to apply CPR maneuvers to the patient, or emergency medical services will be with the patient in a few minutes).
# Calling by phone for emergency medical services. Also, go for an automated defibrillator (AED), but only if the AED is available within a few minutes.
# Attempting defibrillation with the automated external defibrillator (AED), because it is easy to use if it has been found. If not, or until it has arrived, attempting CPR maneuvers as the latest step of those possible ones.

If there are multiple rescuers, these tasks can be distributed and performed simultaneously to save time.

=== Exception to the main sequence ===

* If a rescuer is completely alone with a victim of drowning, or with a child who was already unconscious when the rescuer arrived, the rescuer should:
# First perform two minutes of CPR maneuvers.
#* Variation: when the lone rescuer does not have a phone, it is recommended to perform about two minutes of CPR maneuvers, and then go for a phone to call for emergency medical services (only if the rescuer can return in very few minutes to continue the CPR maneuvers, or emergency medical services will be with the patient in a few minutes).
# Call by phone for emergency medical services. Also, go for an automated defibrillator (AED), but only if the AED is available within a few minutes.
# Attempt defibrillation with the automated external defibrillator (AED), because it is easy to use if it has been found. If not, or until it has arrived, attempt CPR maneuvers as the latest step of those possible ones.

The reason is that CPR ventilation (rescue breaths) is considered the most important action for those victims. Cardiac arrest in drowning victims originates from a lack of oxygen, and a child would probably not suffer from cardiac diseases.

== Methods ==

In 2010, the AHA and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation updated their CPR guidelines. The importance of high quality CPR (sufficient rate and depth without excessively ventilating) was emphasized. The order of interventions was changed for all age groups except newborns from airway, breathing, chest compressions (ABC) to chest compressions, airway, breathing (CAB). An exception to this recommendation is for those believed to be in a respiratory arrest (airway obstruction, drug overdose, etc.).

The most important aspects of CPR are: few interruptions of chest compressions, sufficient speed and depth of compressions, completely relaxing pressure between compressions, and not ventilating too much. It is unclear if a few minutes of CPR before defibrillation results in different outcomes than immediate defibrillation. 

=== Compressions with rescue breaths ===
A normal CPR procedure uses chest compressions and ventilations (rescue breaths, usually mouth-to-mouth) for any victim of cardiac arrest, who would be unresponsive (usually unconscious or approximately unconscious), not breathing, or only gasping because of the lack of heartbeats. But the ventilations could be omitted for untrained rescuers aiding adults who suffer a cardiac arrest (if it is not an asphyxial cardiac arrest, as by drowning, which needs ventilations).The patient&#x27;s head is commonly tilted back (a head-tilt and chin-lift position) for improving the airflow if ventilations can be used. However, when a patient seems to have a possible serious injury in the spinal cord (in the backbone, either at the neck part or the back part), the head must not be moved except if that is completely necessary, and always very carefully, which avoids further damages for the patient&#x27;s mobility in the future. And, in the case of babies, the head is left straight, looking forward, which is necessary for the ventilations, because of the size of the baby&#x27;s neck.In CPR, the chest compressions push on the lower half of the sternum —the bone that is along the middle of the chest from the neck to the belly— and leave it to rise up until recovering its normal position. The rescue breaths are made by pinching the victim&#x27;s nose and blowing air mouth-to-mouth. This fills the lungs, which makes the chest rise up, and increases the pressure into the thoracic cavity. If the victim is a baby, the rescuer would compress the chest with only 2 fingers and would make the ventilations using their own mouth to cover the baby&#x27;s mouth and nose at the same time. The recommended compression-to-ventilation ratio, for all victims of any age, is 30:2 (a cycle that alternates continually 30 rhythmic chest compressions series and 2 rescue breaths series). Victims of drowning receive an initial series of 2 rescue breaths before that cycle begins.

As an exception for the normal compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2, if at least two trained rescuers are present and the victim is a child, the preferred ratio is 15:2. Equally, in newborns, the ratio is 30:2 if one rescuer is present, and 15:2 if two rescuers are present (according to the AHA 2015 Guidelines). In an advanced airway treatment, such as an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway, the artificial ventilation should occur without pauses in compressions at a rate of 1 breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8–10 ventilations per minute).

In all victims, the compression speed is at least 100 compressions per minute. Recommended compression depth in adults and children is of 5 cm (2 inches), and in infants it is 4 cm (1.6 inches). In adults, rescuers should use two hands for the chest compressions (one on top of the other), while in children one hand could be enough (or two, adapting the compressions to the child&#x27;s constitution), and with babies the rescuer must use only two fingers.

There exist some plastic shields and respirators that can be used in the rescue breaths between the mouths of the rescuer and the victim, with the purposes of sealing a better vacuum and avoiding infections.

In some cases, the problem is one of the failures in the rhythm of the heart (ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia) that can be corrected with the electric shock of a defibrillator. So, if a victim is suffering a cardiac arrest, it is important that someone asks for a defibrillator nearby, to try with it a defibrillation process when the victim is already unconscious. The common model of a defibrillator (the AED) is an automatic portable machine that guides the user with recorded voice instructions along the process, analyzes the victim, and applies the correct shocks if they are needed.

The time in which a cardiopulmonary resuscitation can still work is unclear, and it depends on many factors. Many official guides recommend continuing cardiopulmonary resuscitation until emergency medical services arrive (for trying to keep the patient alive, at least). The same guides also indicate asking for any emergency defibrillator (AED) near, to try an automatic defibrillation as soon as possible before considering that the patient has died.

A normal cardiopulmonary resuscitation has a recommended order named &#x27;CAB&#x27;: first &#x27;Chest&#x27; (chest compressions), followed by &#x27;Airway&#x27; (attempt to open the airway by performing a head tilt and a chin lift), and &#x27;Breathing&#x27; (rescue breaths). As of 2010, the Resuscitation Council (UK) was still recommending an &#x27;ABC&#x27; order, with the &#x27;C&#x27; standing for &#x27;Circulation&#x27; (check for a pulse), if the victim is a child. It can be difficult to determine the presence or absence of a pulse, so the pulse check has been removed for common providers and should not be performed for more than 10 seconds by healthcare providers.

=== Compression only ===
For untrained rescuers helping adult victims of cardiac arrest, it is recommended to perform compression-only CPR (chest compressions hands-only or cardiocerebral resuscitation, without artificial ventilation), as it is easier to perform and instructions are easier to give over a phone. In adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, compression-only CPR by the average person has an equal or higher success rate than standard CPR.

The CPR &#x27;compressions only&#x27; procedure consists only of chest compressions that push on the lower half of the bone that is in the middle of the chest (the sternum).

Compression-only CPR is not as good for children who are more likely to have cardiac arrest from respiratory causes. Two reviews have found that compression-only CPR had no more success than no CPR whatsoever. Rescue breaths for children and especially for babies should be relatively gentle. Either a ratio of compressions to breaths of 30:2 or 15:2 was found to have better results for children. Both children and adults should receive 100 chest compressions per minute. Other exceptions besides children include cases of drownings and drug overdose; in both these cases, compressions, and rescue breaths are recommended if the bystander is trained and is willing to do so.

As per the AHA, the beat of the Bee Gees song &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; provides an ideal rhythm in terms of beats per minute to use for hands-only CPR, which is 104 beats-per-minute. One can also hum Queen&#x27;s &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;, which is 110 beats-per-minute and contains a repeating drum pattern. For those in cardiac arrest due to non-heart related causes and in people less than 20 years of age, standard CPR is superior to compression-only CPR.

=== Prone CPR ===
Standard CPR is performed with the victim in supine position. Prone CPR, or reverse CPR, is performed on a victim in prone position, lying on the chest. This is achieved by turning the head to the side and compressing the back. Due to the head being turned, the risk of vomiting and complications caused by aspiration pneumonia may be reduced.

The American Heart Association&#x27;s current guidelines recommend performing CPR in the supine position and limiting prone CPR to situations where the patient cannot be turned.

===Pregnancy===
During pregnancy when a woman is lying on her back, the uterus may compress the inferior vena cava and thus decrease venous return. It is therefore recommended that the uterus be pushed to the woman&#x27;s left. This can be done by placing a pillow or towel under her right hip so that she is on an angle of 15–30 degrees, and making sure their shoulders are flat to the ground. If this is not effective, healthcare professionals should consider emergency resuscitative hysterotomy.

===Family presence===
Evidence generally supports family being present during CPR. This includes in CPR for children.

===Other===
Interposed abdominal compressions may be beneficial in the hospital environment. There is no evidence of benefit pre-hospital or in children.

Cooling during CPR is being studied as currently, results are unclear whether or not it improves outcomes.

Internal cardiac massage is the manual squeezing of the exposed heart itself carried out through a surgical incision into the chest cavity, usually when the chest is already open for cardiac surgery.

Active compression-decompression methods using mechanical decompression of the chest have not been shown to improve outcomes in cardiac arrest.

== Use of devices ==

=== Defibrillators ===
A defibrillator is a machine that produces defibrillation: electric shocks that can restore the normal heart function of the victim. The common model of a defibrillator out of a hospital is the automated external defibrillator (AED), a portable device that is especially easy to use because it produces recorded voice instructions.

Defibrillation is only indicated for some arrhythmias (abnormal heart beatings), specifically ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT). Defibrillation is not indicated if the patient has a normal pulse or is still conscious. Also, it is not indicated in asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA), in those cases a normal CPR would be used to oxygenate the brain until the heart function can be restored. Improperly given electrical shocks can cause dangerous arrhythmias, such as the ventricular fibrillation (VF). 

When a patient does not have heart beatings (or they present a sort of arrhythmia that will stop the heart immediately), it is recommended that someone asks for a defibrillator (because they are quite common in the present time), for trying with it a defibrillation on the already unconscious victim, in case it is successful.

Order of defibrillation in a first aid sequence

It is recommended to call for emergency medical services before a defibrillation. Afterward, a nearby AED defibrillator should be used on the patient as soon as possible. As a general reference, defibrillation is preferred to performing CPR, but only if the AED can be retrieved in a short period of time. All these tasks (calling by phone, getting an AED, and the chest compressions and rescue breaths maneuvers of CPR) can be distributed between many rescuers who make them simultaneously. The defibrillator itself would indicate if more CPR maneuvers are required.

As a slight variation for that sequence, if the rescuer is completely alone with a victim of drowning, or with a child who was already unconscious when the rescuer arrived, the rescuer would do the CPR maneuvers during 2 minutes (approximately 5 cycles of ventilations and compressions); after that, the rescuer would call to emergency medical services, and then it could be tried a search for a defibrillator nearby (the CPR maneuvers are supposed to be the priority for the drowned and most of the already collapsed children).

As another possible variation, if a rescuer is completely alone and without a phone nearby, and is aiding any other victim (not a victim of drowning, nor an already unconscious child), the rescuer would go to call by phone first. After the call, the rescuer would get a nearby defibrillator and use it, or continue the CPR (the phone call and the defibrillator are considered urgent when the problem has a cardiac origin).

Defibrillation

The standard defibrillation device, prepared for fast use out of the medical centers, is the automated external defibrillator (AED), a portable machine of small size (similar to a briefcase) that can be used by any user with no previous training. That machine produces recorded voice instructions that guide the user along the defibrillation process. It also checks the victim&#x27;s condition to automatically apply electric shocks at the correct level, if they are needed. Other models are semi-automatic and require the user to push a button before an electric shock.

A defibrillator may ask for applying CPR maneuvers, so the patient would be placed lying in a face-up position. Additionally, the patient&#x27;s head would be tilted back, except in the case of babies.

Water and metals transmit the electric current. This depends on the amount of water, but it is convenient to avoid starting the defibrillation on a floor with puddles and to dry the wet areas of the patient before (fast, even with any cloth, if that is enough). It is not necessary to remove the patient&#x27;s jewels or piercings, but it should be avoided placing the patches of the defibrillator directly on top of them. The patches with electrodes are put on the positions that appear at the right. In very small bodies: children between 1 and 8 years, and, in general, similar bodies up to 25 kg approximately, it is recommended the use of children&#x27;s size patches with reduced electric doses. If that is not possible, sizes and doses for adults would be used, and, if the patches were too big, one would be placed on the chest and the other on the back (no matter which of them).

There are several devices for improving CPR, but only defibrillators (as of 2010) have been found better than standard CPR for an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

When a defibrillator has been used, it should remain attached to the patient until emergency services arrive.

=== Devices for timing CPR ===
Timing devices can feature a metronome (an item carried by many ambulance crews) to assist the rescuer in achieving the correct rate. Some units can also give timing reminders for performing compressions, ventilating, and changing operators.

=== Devices for assisting in manual CPR ===
Mechanical chest compression devices are not better than standard manual compressions. Their use is reasonable in situations where manual compressions are not safe to perform, such as in a moving vehicle.

Audible and visual prompting may improve the quality of CPR and prevent the decrease of compression rate and depth that naturally occurs with fatigue, and to address this potential improvement, a number of devices have been developed to help improve CPR technique.

These items can be devices to be placed on top of the chest, with the rescuer&#x27;s hands going over the device, and a display or audio feedback giving information on depth, force or rate, or in a wearable format such as a glove. Several published evaluations show that these devices can improve the performance of chest compressions.

As well as its use during actual CPR on a cardiac arrest victim, which relies on the rescuer carrying the device with them, these devices can also be used as part of training programs to improve basic skills in performing correct chest compressions.

===Devices for providing automatic CPR===
Mechanical CPR has not seen as much use as mechanical ventilation; however, use in the prehospital setting is increasing. Devices on the market include the LUCAS device, developed at the University Hospital of Lund, and AutoPulse. Both use straps around the chest to secure the patient. The first generation of the LUCAS uses a gas-driven piston and motor-driven constricting band, while later versions are battery-operated.

There are several advantages to automated devices: they allow rescuers to focus on performing other interventions; they do not fatigue and begin to perform less effective compressions, as humans do; they can perform effective compressions in limited-space environments such as air ambulances, where manual compressions are difficult, and they allow ambulance workers to be strapped in safely rather than standing over a patient in a speeding vehicle. However the disadvantages are cost to purchase, time to train emergency personnel to use them, interruption to CPR to implement, potential for incorrect application and the need for multiple device sizes.

Several studies have shown little or no improvement in survival rates but acknowledge the need for more study.

===Mobile apps for providing CPR instructions===
To support training and incident management, mobile apps have been published in the largest app markets. An evaluation of 61 available apps has revealed that a large number do not follow international guidelines for basic life support and many apps are not designed in a user-friendly way. As a result, the Red Cross updated and endorsed its emergency preparedness application, which uses pictures, text, and videos to assist the user. The UK Resuscitation Council has an app, called Lifesaver, which shows how to perform CPR.

== Effectivity rate ==
CPR oxygenates the body and brain, which favors making a later defibrillation and the advanced life support. Even in the case of a &quot;non-shockable&quot; rhythm, such as pulseless electrical activity (PEA) where defibrillation is not indicated, effective CPR is no less important. Used alone, CPR will result in few complete recoveries, though the outcome without CPR is almost uniformly fatal.

Studies have shown that immediate CPR followed by defibrillation within 3–5 minutes of sudden VF cardiac arrest dramatically improves survival. In cities such as Seattle where CPR training is widespread and defibrillation by EMS personnel follows quickly, the survival rate is about 20 percent for all causes and as high as 57 percent for a witnessed &quot;shockable&quot; arrest. In cities such as New York, without those advantages, the survival rate is only 5 percent for witnessed shockable arrest. Similarly, in-hospital CPR is more successful when arrests are witnessed, occur in the ICU, or occur in patients wearing heart monitors.

\* AED data here exclude health facilities and nursing homes, where patients are sicker than average.

In adults compression-only CPR by bystanders appears to be better than chest compressions with rescue breathing. Compression-only CPR may be less effective in children than in adults, as cardiac arrest in children is more likely to have a non-cardiac cause. In a 2010 prospective study of cardiac arrest in children (age 1–17) for arrests with a non-cardiac cause, provision by bystanders of conventional CPR with rescue breathing yielded a favorable neurological outcome at one month more often than did compression-only CPR (OR 5.54). For arrests with a cardiac cause in this cohort, there was no difference between the two techniques (OR 1.20). This is consistent with American Heart Association guidelines for parents.

When done by trained responders, 30 compressions interrupted by two breaths appears to have a slightly better result than continuous chest compressions with breaths being delivered while compressions are ongoing.

Measurement of end-tidal carbon dioxide during CPR reflects cardiac output and can predict chances of ROSC.

In a study of in-hospital CPR from 2000 to 2008, 59% of CPR survivors lived over a year after hospital discharge and 44% lived over 3 years.

==Consequences==
Survival rates: In US hospitals in 2017, 26% of patients who received CPR survived to hospital discharge.
In 2017 in the US, outside hospitals, 16% of people whose cardiac arrest was witnessed survived to hospital discharge.

Since 2003, widespread cooling of patients after CPR
and other improvements have raised survival and reduced mental disabilities.

===Organ donation===
Organ donation is usually made possible by CPR, even if CPR does not save the patient. If there is a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), all organs can be considered for donation. If the patient does not achieve ROSC, and CPR continues until an operating room is available, the kidneys and liver can still be considered for donation.
1,000 organs per year in the US are transplanted from patients who had CPR.
Donations can be taken from 40% of patients who have ROSC and later become brain-dead.
Up to 8 organs can be taken from each donor,
and an average of 3 organs are taken from each patient who donates organs.

===Mental abilities===
Mental abilities are about the same for survivors before and after CPR for 89% of patients, based on before and after counts of 12,500 US patients&#x27; Cerebral-Performance Category (CPC) codes in a 2000–2009 study of CPR in hospitals. 1% more survivors were in comas than before CPR. 5% more needed help with daily activities. 5% more had moderate mental problems and could still be independent.

For CPR outside hospitals, a Copenhagen study of 2,504 patients in 2007-2011 found that 21% of survivors developed moderate mental problems but could still be independent, and 11% of survivors developed severe mental problems, so they needed daily help. Two patients out of 2,504 went into comas (0.1% of patients, or 2 out of 419 survivors, 0.5%), and the study did not track how long the comas lasted.

Most people in comas start to recover in 2–3 weeks. 2018 guidelines on disorders of consciousness say it is no longer appropriate to use the term &quot;permanent vegetative state.&quot; Mental abilities can continue to improve in the six months after discharge, and in subsequent years. For long-term problems, brains form new paths to replace damaged areas.

===Injuries===
Injuries from CPR vary. 87% of patients are not injured by CPR. Overall, injuries are caused in 13% (2009–12 data) of patients, including broken sternum or ribs (9%), lung injuries (3%), and internal bleeding (3%).
The internal injuries counted here can include heart contusion, hemopericardium, upper airway complications, damage to the abdominal viscera − lacerations of the liver and spleen, fat emboli, pulmonary complications − pneumothorax, hemothorax, lung contusions. Most injuries did not affect care; only 1% of those given CPR received life-threatening injuries from it.

Broken ribs are present in 3%
of those who survive to hospital discharge, and 15% of those who die in the hospital, for an average rate of 9% (2009-12 data)
to 8% (1997–99).
In the 2009-12 study, 20% of survivors were older than 75. A study in the 1990s found 55% of CPR patients who died before discharge had broken ribs, and a study in the 1960s found 97% did; training and experience levels have improved. Lung injuries were caused in 3% of patients and other internal bleeding in 3% (2009–12).

Bones heal in 1–2 months.

The costal cartilage also breaks in an unknown number of additional cases, which can sound like breaking bones.

The type and frequency of injury can be affected by factors such as sex and age. A 1999 Austrian study of CPR on cadavers, using a machine that alternately compressed the chest and then pulled it outward, found a higher rate of sternal fractures in female cadavers (9 of 17) than males (2 of 20), and found the risk of rib fractures rose with age, though they did not say how much.
Children and infants have a low risk of rib fractures during CPR, with an incidence of less than 2%, although, when they do occur, they are usually anterior and multiple.

Where CPR is performed in error by a bystander, on a person not in cardiac arrest, around 2% have injury as a result (although 12% experienced discomfort).

A 2004 overview said, &quot;Chest injury is a price worth paying to achieve optimal efficacy of chest compressions. Cautious or faint-hearted chest compression may save bones in the individual case but not the patient&#x27;s life.&quot;

===Other side effects===
The most common side effect is vomiting, which necessitates clearing the mouth so patients do not breathe it in.
It happened in 16 of 35 CPR efforts in a 1989 study in King County, Washington.
===Survival differences, based on prior illness, age or location===
The American Heart Association guidelines say that survival rates below 1% are &quot;futility,&quot; but all groups have better survival than that. Even among very sick patients, at least 10% survive: A study of CPR in a sample of US hospitals from 2001 to 2010, where overall survival was 19%, found 10% survival among cancer patients, 12% among dialysis patients, 14% over age 80, 15% among blacks, 17% for patients who lived in nursing homes, 19% for patients with heart failure, and 25% for patients with heart monitoring outside the ICU.
Another study, of advanced cancer patients, found the same 10% survival mentioned above.
A study of Swedish patients in 2007–2015 with ECG monitors found 40% survived at least 30 days after CPR at ages 70–79, 29% at ages 80–89, and 27% above age 90.

An earlier study of Medicare patients in hospitals from 1992–2005, where overall survival was 18%, found 13% survival in the poorest neighborhoods, 12% survival over age 90, 15% survival among ages 85–89, and 17% survival among ages 80–84.
Swedish patients 90 years or older had 15% survival to hospital discharge, 80–89 had 20%, and 70–79 had 28%.

A study of King County WA patients who had CPR outside hospitals in 1999–2003, where 34% survived to hospital discharge overall, found that among patients with 4 or more major medical conditions, 18% survived; with 3 major conditions 24% survived, and 33% of those with 2 major medical conditions survived.

Nursing home residents&#x27; survival has been studied by several authors,
and is measured annually by the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES). CARES reports CPR results from a catchment area of 115 million people, including 23 state-wide registries, and individual communities in 18 other states as of 2019. CARES data show that in health care facilities and nursing homes where AEDs are available and used, survival rates are double the average survival found in nursing homes overall.

Geographically, there is wide variation from state to state in survival after CPR &quot;in US hospitals,&quot; from 40% in Wyoming to 20% in New York, so there is room for good practices to spread, raising the averages.
For CPR &quot;outside hospitals&quot;, survival varies even more across the US, from 3% in Omaha to 45% in Seattle in 2001. This study only counted heart rhythms that can respond to defibrillator shocks (tachycardia).
A major reason for the variation has been the delay in some areas between the call to emergency services and the departure of medics, and then arrival and treatment. Delays were caused by a lack of monitoring, and the mismatch between recruiting people as firefighters, though most emergency calls they are assigned to are medical, so staff resisted and delayed on the medical calls. Building codes have cut the number of fires, but staff still think of themselves as firefighters.


===Dysthanasia===
In some instances, CPR can be considered a form of dysthanasia.

==Prevalence==
===Chance of receiving CPR===
Various studies show that in out-of-home cardiac arrest, bystanders in the US attempt CPR in between 14% and 45% of the time, with a median of 32%. Globally, rates of bystander CPR are reported to be as low as 1% and as high as 44%. However, the effectiveness of this CPR is variable, and the studies suggest only around half of bystander CPR is performed correctly. One study found that members of the public having received CPR training in the past lack the skills and confidence needed to save lives. The report&#x27;s authors suggested that better training is needed to improve the willingness to respond to cardiac arrest. Factors that influence bystander CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest include:
* Affordable training
* Target CPR training to family members of potential cardiac arrest
* CPR classes should be simplified and shortened
* Offer reassurance and education about CPR
* Provide clearer information about legal implications for specific regions
* Focus on reducing the stigma and fears around providing bystander CPR
There is a relation between age and the chance of CPR being commenced. Younger people are far more likely to have CPR attempted on them before the arrival of emergency medical services. Bystanders more commonly administer CPR when in public than when at the person&#x27;s home, although healthcare professionals are responsible for more than half of out-of-hospital resuscitation attempts. People with no connection to the person are more likely to perform CPR than family members.

There is also a clear relation between the cause of arrest and the likelihood of a bystander initiating CPR. Laypersons are most likely to give CPR to younger people in cardiac arrest in a public place when it has a medical cause; those in arrest from trauma, exsanguination or intoxication are less likely to receive CPR.

It is believed that there is a higher chance that CPR will be performed if the bystander is told to perform only the chest compression element of the resuscitation.

The first formal study into gender bias in receiving CPR from the public versus professionals was conducted by the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and examined nearly 20,000 cases across the U.S. The study found that women are six percent less likely than men to receive bystander CPR when in cardiac arrest in a public place, citing the disparity as &quot;likely due to the fear of being falsely accused of sexual assault.&quot;

===Chance of receiving CPR in time===
CPR is likely to be effective only if commenced within 6 minutes after the blood flow stops because permanent brain cell damage occurs when fresh blood infuses the cells after that time, since the cells of the brain become dormant in as little as 4–6 minutes in an oxygen-deprived environment and, therefore, cannot survive the reintroduction of oxygen in a traditional resuscitation. Research using cardioplegic blood infusion resulted in a 79.4% survival rate with cardiac arrest intervals of 72±43 minutes, traditional methods achieve a 15% survival rate in this scenario, by comparison. New research is currently needed to determine what role CPR, defibrillation, and new advanced gradual resuscitation techniques will have with this new knowledge.

A notable exception is cardiac arrest which occurs in conjunction with exposure to very cold temperatures. Hypothermia seems to protect by slowing down metabolic and physiologic processes, greatly decreasing the tissues&#x27; need for oxygen. There are cases where CPR, defibrillation, and advanced warming techniques have revived victims after substantial periods of hypothermia.

==Society and culture==
===Portrayed effectiveness===
CPR is often severely misrepresented in movies and television as being highly effective in resuscitating a person who is not breathing and has no circulation.

A 1996 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that CPR success rates in television shows were 75% for immediate circulation, and 67% survival to discharge. This gives the general public an unrealistic expectation of a successful outcome. When educated on the actual survival rates, the proportion of patients over 60 years of age desiring CPR should they have a cardiac arrest drops from 41% to 22%.

===Training and stage CPR===

It is dangerous to perform CPR on a person who is breathing normally. These chest compressions create significant local blunt trauma, risking bruising or fracture of the sternum or ribs. If a patient is not breathing, these risks still exist but are dwarfed by the immediate threat to life. For this reason, training is always done with a mannequin, such as the well-known Resusci Anne model.

The portrayal of the CPR technique on television and film often is purposely incorrect. Actors simulating the performance of CPR may bend their elbows while appearing to compress, to prevent force from reaching the chest of the actor portraying the patient.

===Self-CPR hoax===
A form of &quot;self-CPR&quot; termed &quot;cough CPR&quot; was the subject of a hoax chain e-mail entitled &quot;How to Survive a Heart Attack When Alone,&quot; which wrongly cited &quot;Via Health Rochester General Hospital&quot; as the source of the technique. Rochester General Hospital has denied any connection with the technique.

&quot;Cough CPR&quot; in the sense of &quot;resuscitating&quot; oneself is impossible because a prominent symptom of cardiac arrest is unconsciousness, which makes coughing impossible.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and other resuscitation bodies do not endorse &quot;cough CPR&quot;, which it terms a misnomer as it is not a form of &quot;resuscitation&quot;. The AHA does recognize a limited legitimate use of the coughing technique: &quot;This coughing technique to maintain blood flow during brief arrhythmias has been useful in the hospital, particularly during cardiac catheterization. In such cases, the patient&#x27;s ECG is monitored continuously, and a physician is present.&quot; When coughing is used on trained and monitored patients in hospitals, it is effective only for 90 seconds.

===Learning from film===
In at least one case, it has been alleged that CPR learned from a film was used to save a person&#x27;s life. In April 2011, it was claimed that nine-year-old Tristin Saghin saved his sister&#x27;s life by administering CPR on her after she fell into a swimming pool, using only the knowledge of CPR that he had gleaned from a motion picture, &quot;Black Hawk Down.&quot;

===Hands-only CPR portrayal===
Less than 1/3 of those people who experience a cardiac arrest at home, work, or in a public location have CPR performed on them. Most bystanders are worried that they might do something wrong. On October 28, 2009, the American Heart Association and the Ad Council launched a hands-only CPR public service announcement and website as a means to address this issue. In July 2011, new content was added to the website including a digital app that helps a user learn how to perform hands-only CPR.

==History==
In the 19th century, Doctor H. R. Silvester described a method (the Silvester method) of artificial ventilation in which the patient is laid on their back, and their arms are raised above their head to aid inhalation and then pressed against their chest to aid exhalation. The Holger Nielsen technique of artificial respiration, developed by Danish physician Holger Nielsen, revolutionized the field of emergency medical care. Introduced in the early 20th century, this technique involved positioning the patient in a supine position (lying flat on their back) and the performer of the technique kneeling beside or above the patient. The Holger Nielsen technique utilized a manual resuscitator, commonly referred to as the &quot;Holger Nielsen bag,&quot; to administer rescue breaths. The performer would place a mask or the bag&#x27;s mouthpiece over the patient&#x27;s mouth and nose while manually compressing the bag. This action would deliver a controlled flow of air into the patient&#x27;s lungs, aiding in oxygenation and facilitating the exchange of gases.

It was not until the middle of the 20th century that the wider medical community started to recognize and promote artificial ventilation in the form of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation combined with chest compressions as a key part of resuscitation following cardiac arrest. The combination was first seen in a 1962 training video called &quot;The Pulse of Life&quot; created by James Jude, Guy Knickerbocker, and Peter Safar. Jude and Knickerbocker, along with William Kouwenhoven and Joseph S. Redding had recently discovered the method of external chest compressions, whereas Safar had worked with Redding and James Elam to prove the effectiveness of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The first effort at testing the technique was performed on a dog by Redding, Safar, and JW Pearson. Soon afterward, the technique was used to save the life of a child. Their combined findings were presented at the annual Maryland Medical Society meeting on September 16, 1960, in Ocean City, and gained widespread acceptance over the following decade, helped by the video and speaking tour they undertook. Peter Safar wrote the book &quot;ABC of Resuscitation&quot; in 1957. In the U.S., it was first promoted as a technique for the public to learn in the 1970s.

Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was combined with chest compressions based on the assumption that active ventilation is necessary to keep circulating blood oxygenated, and the combination was accepted without comparing its effectiveness with chest compressions alone. However, research in the 2000s demonstrated that assumption to be in error, resulting in the American Heart Association&#x27;s acknowledgment of the effectiveness of chest compressions alone (see &quot;Compression only&quot; in this article).

CPR methods continued to advance, with developments in the 2010s including an emphasis on constant, rapid heart stimulation, and a de-emphasis on the respiration aspect. Studies have shown that people who had rapid, constant heart-only chest compression are 22% more likely to survive than those receiving conventional CPR that included breathing. Because people tend to be reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, chest-only CPR nearly doubles the chances of survival overall, by increasing the odds of receiving CPR in the first place.

==On animals==
It is feasible to perform CPR on animals, including cats and dogs. The principles and practices are similar to CPR for humans, except that resuscitation is usually done through the animal&#x27;s nose, not the mouth. CPR should only be performed on unconscious animals to avoid the risk of being bitten; a conscious animal would not require chest compressions. Animals, depending on species, may have a lower bone density than humans and so CPR can cause bones to become weakened after it is performed.

==Research==
Cerebral performance category (CPC scores) are used as a research tool to describe &quot;good&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; outcomes. Level 1 is conscious and alert with normal function. Level 2 is only slight disability. Level 3 is a moderate disability. Level 4 is a severe disability. Level 5 is comatose or persistent vegetative state. Level 6 is brain dead or death from other causes.

<text>Clinical death is the medical term for cessation of blood circulation and breathing, the two criteria necessary to sustain the lives of human beings and of many other organisms. It occurs when the heart stops beating in a regular rhythm, a condition called cardiac arrest. The term is also sometimes used in resuscitation research.

Stopped blood circulation has historically proven irreversible in most cases. Prior to the invention of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), defibrillation, epinephrine injection, and other treatments in the 20th century, the absence of blood circulation (and vital functions related to blood circulation) was historically considered the official definition of death. With the advent of these strategies, cardiac arrest came to be called &quot;clinical death&quot; rather than simply &quot;death&quot;, to reflect the possibility of post-arrest resuscitation.

At the onset of clinical death, consciousness is lost within several seconds, and in dogs, measurable brain activity has been measured to stop within 20 to 40 seconds. Irregular gasping may occur during this early time period, and is sometimes mistaken by rescuers as a sign that CPR is not necessary. During clinical death, all tissues and organs in the body steadily accumulate a type of injury called ischemic injury.

==Limits of reversal==

Most tissues and organs of the body can survive clinical death for considerable periods. Blood circulation can be stopped in the entire body below the heart for at least 30 minutes, with injury to the spinal cord being a limiting factor. Detached limbs may be successfully reattached after 6 hours of no blood circulation at warm temperatures. Bone, tendon, and skin can survive as long as 8 to 12 hours.

The brain, however, appears to accumulate ischemic injury faster than any other organ. Without special treatment after circulation is restarted, full recovery of the brain after more than 3 minutes of clinical death at normal body temperature is rare. Usually brain damage or later brain death results after longer intervals of clinical death even if the heart is restarted and blood circulation is successfully restored. Brain injury is therefore the chief limiting factor for recovery from clinical death.

Although loss of function is almost immediate, there is no specific duration of clinical death at which the non-functioning brain clearly dies. The most vulnerable cells in the brain, CA1 neurons of the hippocampus, are fatally injured by as little as 10 minutes without oxygen. However, the injured cells do not actually die until hours after resuscitation. This delayed death can be prevented &quot;in vitro&quot; by a simple drug treatment even after 20 minutes without oxygen. In other areas of the brain, viable human neurons have been recovered and grown in culture hours after clinical death. Brain failure after clinical death is now known to be due to a complex series of processes called reperfusion injury that occur &quot;after&quot; blood circulation has been restored, especially processes that interfere with blood circulation during the recovery period. Control of these processes is the subject of ongoing research.

In 1990, the laboratory of resuscitation pioneer Peter Safar discovered that reducing body temperature by three degrees Celsius after restarting blood circulation could double the time window of recovery from clinical death without brain damage from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. This induced hypothermia technique is beginning to be used in emergency medicine. The combination of mildly reducing body temperature, reducing blood cell concentration, and increasing blood pressure after resuscitation was found especially effectiveallowing for recovery of dogs after 12 minutes of clinical death at normal body temperature with practically no brain injury. The addition of a drug treatment protocol has been reported to allow recovery of dogs after 16 minutes of clinical death at normal body temperature with no lasting brain injury. Cooling treatment alone has permitted recovery after 17 minutes of clinical death at normal temperature, but with brain injury.

Under laboratory conditions at normal body temperature, the longest period of clinical death of a cat (after complete circulatory arrest) survived with eventual return of brain function is one hour.

==Hypothermia==
Reduced body temperature, or therapeutic hypothermia, during clinical death slows the rate of injury accumulation, and extends the time period during which clinical death can be survived. The decrease in the rate of injury can be approximated by the Q10 rule, which states that the rate of biochemical reactions decreases by a factor of two for every 10 °C reduction in temperature. As a result, humans can sometimes survive periods of clinical death exceeding one hour at temperatures below 20 °C. The prognosis is improved if clinical death is caused by hypothermia rather than occurring prior to it; in 1999, 29-year-old Swedish woman Anna Bågenholm spent 80 minutes trapped in ice and survived with a near full recovery from a 13.7 °C core body temperature. It is said in emergency medicine that &quot;nobody is dead until they are warm and dead.&quot; In animal studies, up to three hours of clinical death can be survived at temperatures near 0 °C.

==Life support==
The purpose of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during cardiac arrest is ideally reversal of the clinically dead state by restoration of blood circulation and breathing. However, there is great variation in the effectiveness of CPR for this purpose. Blood pressure is very low during manual CPR, resulting in only a ten-minute average extension of survival. Yet there are cases of patients regaining consciousness during CPR while still in full cardiac arrest. In absence of cerebral function monitoring or frank return to consciousness, the neurological status of patients undergoing CPR is intrinsically uncertain. It is somewhere between the state of clinical death and a normal functioning state.

Patients supported by methods that certainly maintain enough blood circulation and oxygenation for sustaining life during stopped heartbeat and breathing, such as cardiopulmonary bypass, are not customarily considered clinically dead. All parts of the body except the heart and lungs continue to function normally. Clinical death occurs only if machines providing sole circulatory support are turned off, leaving the patient in a state of stopped blood circulation.

==Controlled==
Certain surgeries for cerebral aneurysms or aortic arch defects require that blood circulation be stopped while repairs are performed. This deliberate temporary induction of clinical death is called circulatory arrest. It is typically performed by lowering body temperature to between 18 °C and 20 °C (64 and 68 °F) and stopping the heart and lungs. This state is called deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. At such low temperatures most patients can tolerate the clinically dead state for up to 30 minutes without incurring significant brain injury.
Longer durations are possible at lower temperatures, but the usefulness of longer procedures has not been established yet.

Controlled clinical death has also been proposed as a treatment for exsanguinating trauma to create time for surgical repair.

==Determination==
Death was historically believed to be an event that coincided with the onset of clinical death. It is now understood that death is a series of physical events, not a single one, and determination of permanent death is dependent on other factors beyond simple cessation of breathing and heartbeat.

Clinical death that occurs unexpectedly is treated as a medical emergency. CPR is initiated. In a United States hospital, a Code Blue is declared and Advanced Cardiac Life Support procedures used to attempt to restart a normal heartbeat. This effort continues until either the heart is restarted, or a physician determines that continued efforts are useless and recovery is impossible. If this determination is made, the physician pronounces legal death and resuscitation efforts stop.

If clinical death is expected due to terminal illness or withdrawal of supportive care, often a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) or &quot;no code&quot; order is in place. This means that no resuscitation efforts are made, and a physician or nurse may pronounce legal death at the onset of clinical death.

A patient with working heart and lungs who is determined to be brain dead can be pronounced legally dead without clinical death occurring. However, some courts have been reluctant to impose such a determination over the religious objections of family members, such as in the Jesse Koochin case. Similar issues were also raised by the case of Mordechai Dov Brody, but the child died before a court could resolve the matter.
Conversely, in the case of Marlise Muñoz, a hospital refused to remove a brain dead woman from life support machines for nearly two months, despite her husband&#x27;s requests, because she was pregnant.

<text>In nuclear physics, the island of stability is a predicted set of isotopes of superheavy elements that may have considerably longer half-lives than known isotopes of these elements. It is predicted to appear as an &quot;island&quot; in the chart of nuclides, separated from known stable and long-lived primordial radionuclides. Its theoretical existence is attributed to stabilizing effects of predicted &quot;magic numbers&quot; of protons and neutrons in the superheavy mass region.
Several predictions have been made regarding the exact location of the island of stability, though it is generally thought to center near copernicium and flerovium isotopes in the vicinity of the predicted closed neutron shell at &quot;N&quot; = 184. These models strongly suggest that the closed shell will confer further stability towards fission and alpha decay. While these effects are expected to be greatest near atomic number &quot;Z&quot; = 114 (flerovium) and &quot;N&quot; = 184, the region of increased stability is expected to encompass several neighboring elements, and there may also be additional islands of stability around heavier nuclei that are doubly magic (having magic numbers of both protons and neutrons). Estimates of the stability of the nuclides within the island are usually around a half-life of minutes or days; some optimists propose half-lives on the order of millions of years.

Although the nuclear shell model predicting magic numbers has existed since the 1940s, the existence of long-lived superheavy nuclides has not been definitively demonstrated. Like the rest of the superheavy elements, the nuclides within the island of stability have never been found in nature; thus, they must be created artificially in a nuclear reaction to be studied. Scientists have not found a way to carry out such a reaction, for it is likely that new types of reactions will be needed to populate nuclei near the center of the island. Nevertheless, the successful synthesis of superheavy elements up to &quot;Z&quot; = 118 (oganesson) with up to 177 neutrons demonstrates a slight stabilizing effect around elements 110 to 114 that may continue in heavier isotopes, consistent with the existence of the island of stability.

==Introduction==
===Nuclide stability===

The composition of a nuclide (atomic nucleus) is defined by the number of protons &quot;Z&quot; and the number of neutrons &quot;N&quot;, which sum to mass number &quot;A&quot;. Proton number &quot;Z&quot;, also named the atomic number, determines the position of an element in the periodic table. The approximately 3300 known nuclides are commonly represented in a chart with &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;N&quot; for its axes and the half-life for radioactive decay indicated for each unstable nuclide (see figure). , 251 nuclides are observed to be stable (having never been observed to decay); generally, as the number of protons increases, stable nuclei have a higher neutron–proton ratio (more neutrons per proton). The last element in the periodic table that has a stable isotope is lead (&quot;Z&quot; = 82), with stability (i.e., half-lives of the longest-lived isotopes) generally decreasing in heavier elements, especially beyond curium (&quot;Z&quot; = 96). The half-lives of nuclei also decrease when there is a lopsided neutron–proton ratio, such that the resulting nuclei have too few or too many neutrons to be stable.

The stability of a nucleus is determined by its binding energy, higher binding energy conferring greater stability. The binding energy per nucleon increases with atomic number to a broad plateau around &quot;A&quot; = 60, then declines. If a nucleus can be split into two parts that have a lower total energy (a consequence of the mass defect resulting from greater binding energy), it is unstable. The nucleus can hold together for a finite time because there is a potential barrier opposing the split, but this barrier can be crossed by quantum tunneling. The lower the barrier and the masses of the fragments, the greater the probability per unit time of a split.

Protons in a nucleus are bound together by the strong force, which counterbalances the Coulomb repulsion between positively charged protons. In heavier nuclei, larger numbers of uncharged neutrons are needed to reduce repulsion and confer additional stability. Even so, as physicists started to synthesize elements that are not found in nature, they found the stability decreased as the nuclei became heavier. Thus, they speculated that the periodic table might come to an end. The discoverers of plutonium (element 94) considered naming it &quot;ultimium&quot;, thinking it was the last. Following the discoveries of heavier elements, of which some decayed in microseconds, it then seemed that instability with respect to spontaneous fission would limit the existence of heavier elements. In 1939, an upper limit of potential element synthesis was estimated around element 104, and following the first discoveries of transactinide elements in the early 1960s, this upper limit prediction was extended to element 108.

===Magic numbers===
As early as 1914, the possible existence of superheavy elements with atomic numbers well beyond that of uranium—then the heaviest known element—was suggested, when German physicist Richard Swinne proposed that superheavy elements around &quot;Z&quot; = 108 were a source of radiation in cosmic rays. Although he did not make any definitive observations, he hypothesized in 1931 that transuranium elements around &quot;Z&quot; = 100 or &quot;Z&quot; = 108 may be relatively long-lived and possibly exist in nature. In 1955, American physicist John Archibald Wheeler also proposed the existence of these elements; he is credited with the first usage of the term &quot;superheavy element&quot; in a 1958 paper published with Frederick Werner. This idea did not attract wide interest until a decade later, after improvements in the nuclear shell model. In this model, the atomic nucleus is built up in &quot;shells&quot;, analogous to electron shells in atoms. Independently of each other, neutrons and protons have energy levels that are normally close together, but after a given shell is filled, it takes substantially more energy to start filling the next. Thus, the binding energy per nucleon reaches a local maximum and nuclei with filled shells are more stable than those without. This theory of a nuclear shell model originates in the 1930s, but it was not until 1949 that German physicists Maria Goeppert Mayer and Johannes Hans Daniel Jensen et al. independently devised the correct formulation.

The numbers of nucleons for which shells are filled are called magic numbers. Magic numbers of 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 and 126 have been observed for neutrons, and the next number is predicted to be 184. Protons share the first six of these magic numbers, and 126 has been predicted as a magic proton number since the 1940s. Nuclides with a magic number of each—such as 16O (&quot;Z&quot; = 8, &quot;N&quot; = 8), 132Sn (&quot;Z&quot; = 50, &quot;N&quot; = 82), and 208Pb (&quot;Z&quot; = 82, &quot;N&quot; = 126)—are referred to as &quot;doubly magic&quot; and are more stable than nearby nuclides as a result of greater binding energies.

In the late 1960s, more sophisticated shell models were formulated by American physicist William Myers and Polish physicist Władysław Świątecki, and independently by German physicist Heiner Meldner (1939–2019). With these models, taking into account Coulomb repulsion, Meldner predicted that the next proton magic number may be 114 instead of 126. Myers and Świątecki appear to have coined the term &quot;island of stability&quot;, and American chemist Glenn Seaborg, later a discoverer of many of the superheavy elements, quickly adopted the term and promoted it. Myers and Świątecki also proposed that some superheavy nuclei would be longer-lived as a consequence of higher fission barriers. Further improvements in the nuclear shell model by Soviet physicist Vilen Strutinsky led to the emergence of the macroscopic–microscopic method, a nuclear mass model that takes into consideration both smooth trends characteristic of the liquid drop model and local fluctuations such as shell effects. This approach enabled Swedish physicist Sven Nilsson et al., as well as other groups, to make the first detailed calculations of the stability of nuclei within the island. With the emergence of this model, Strutinsky, Nilsson, and other groups argued for the existence of the doubly magic nuclide 298Fl (&quot;Z&quot; = 114, &quot;N&quot; = 184), rather than 310Ubh (&quot;Z&quot; = 126, &quot;N&quot; = 184) which was predicted to be doubly magic as early as 1957. Subsequently, estimates of the proton magic number have ranged from 114 to 126, and there is still no consensus.

==Discoveries==
Interest in a possible island of stability grew throughout the 1960s, as some calculations suggested that it might contain nuclides with half-lives of billions of years. They were also predicted to be especially stable against spontaneous fission in spite of their high atomic mass. It was thought that if such elements exist and are sufficiently long-lived, there may be several novel applications as a consequence of their nuclear and chemical properties. These include use in particle accelerators as neutron sources, in nuclear weapons as a consequence of their predicted low critical masses and high number of neutrons emitted per fission, and as nuclear fuel to power space missions. These speculations led many researchers to conduct searches for superheavy elements in the 1960s and 1970s, both in nature and through nucleosynthesis in particle accelerators.

During the 1970s, many searches for long-lived superheavy nuclei were conducted. Experiments aimed at synthesizing elements ranging in atomic number from 110 to 127 were conducted at laboratories around the world. These elements were sought in fusion-evaporation reactions, in which a heavy target made of one nuclide is irradiated by accelerated ions of another in a cyclotron, and new nuclides are produced after these nuclei fuse and the resulting excited system releases energy by evaporating several particles (usually protons, neutrons, or alpha particles). These reactions are divided into &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;hot&quot; fusion, which respectively create systems with lower and higher excitation energies; this affects the yield of the reaction. For example, the reaction between 248Cm and 40Ar was expected to yield isotopes of element 114, and that between 232Th and 84Kr was expected to yield isotopes of element 126. None of these attempts were successful, indicating that such experiments may have been insufficiently sensitive if reaction cross sections were low—resulting in lower yields—or that any nuclei reachable via such fusion-evaporation reactions might be too short-lived for detection. Subsequent successful experiments reveal that half-lives and cross sections indeed decrease with increasing atomic number, resulting in the synthesis of only a few short-lived atoms of the heaviest elements in each experiment; , the highest reported cross section for a superheavy nuclide near the island of stability is for 288Mc in the reaction between 243Am and 48Ca.

Similar searches in nature were also unsuccessful, suggesting that if superheavy elements do exist in nature, their abundance is less than 10−14 moles of superheavy elements per mole of ore. Despite these unsuccessful attempts to observe long-lived superheavy nuclei, new superheavy elements were synthesized every few years in laboratories through light-ion bombardment and cold fusion reactions; rutherfordium, the first transactinide, was discovered in 1969, and copernicium, eight protons closer to the island of stability predicted at &quot;Z&quot; = 114, was reached by 1996. Even though the half-lives of these nuclei are very short (on the order of seconds), the very existence of elements heavier than rutherfordium is indicative of stabilizing effects thought to be caused by closed shells; a model not considering such effects would forbid the existence of these elements due to rapid spontaneous fission.

Flerovium, with the expected magic 114 protons, was first synthesized in 1998 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, by a group of physicists led by Yuri Oganessian. A single atom of element 114 was detected, with a lifetime of 30.4 seconds, and its decay products had half-lives measurable in minutes. Because the produced nuclei underwent alpha decay rather than fission, and the half-lives were several orders of magnitude longer than those previously predicted or observed for superheavy elements, this event was seen as a &quot;textbook example&quot; of a decay chain characteristic of the island of stability, providing strong evidence for the existence of the island of stability in this region. Even though the original 1998 chain was not observed again, and its assignment remains uncertain, further successful experiments in the next two decades led to the discovery of all elements up to oganesson, whose half-lives were found to exceed initially predicted values; these decay properties further support the presence of the island of stability. However, a 2021 study on the decay chains of flerovium isotopes suggests that there is no strong stabilizing effect from &quot;Z&quot; = 114 in the region of known nuclei (&quot;N&quot; = 174), and that extra stability would be predominantly a consequence of the neutron shell closure. Although known nuclei still fall several neutrons short of &quot;N&quot; = 184 where maximum stability is expected (the most neutron-rich confirmed nuclei, 293Lv and 294Ts, only reach &quot;N&quot; = 177), and the exact location of the center of the island remains unknown, the trend of increasing stability closer to &quot;N&quot; = 184 has been demonstrated. For example, the isotope 285Cn, with eight more neutrons than 277Cn, has a half-life almost five orders of magnitude longer. This trend is expected to continue into unknown heavier isotopes in the vicinity of the shell closure.

===Deformed nuclei===
Though nuclei within the island of stability around &quot;N&quot; = 184 are predicted to be spherical, studies from the early 1990s—beginning with Polish physicists Zygmunt Patyk and Adam Sobiczewski in 1991—suggest that some superheavy elements do not have perfectly spherical nuclei. A change in the shape of the nucleus changes the position of neutrons and protons in the shell. Research indicates that large nuclei farther from spherical magic numbers are deformed, causing magic numbers to shift or new magic numbers to appear. Current theoretical investigation indicates that in the region &quot;Z&quot; = 106–108 and &quot;N&quot; ≈ 160–164, nuclei may be more resistant to fission as a consequence of shell effects for deformed nuclei; thus, such superheavy nuclei would only undergo alpha decay. Hassium-270 is now believed to be a doubly magic deformed nucleus, with deformed magic numbers &quot;Z&quot; = 108 and &quot;N&quot; = 162. It has a half-life of 9 seconds. This is consistent with models that take into account the deformed nature of nuclei intermediate between the actinides and island of stability near &quot;N&quot; = 184, in which a stability &quot;peninsula&quot; emerges at deformed magic numbers &quot;Z&quot; = 108 and &quot;N&quot; = 162. Determination of the decay properties of neighboring hassium and seaborgium isotopes near &quot;N&quot; = 162 provides further strong evidence for this region of relative stability in deformed nuclei. This also strongly suggests that the island of stability (for spherical nuclei) is not completely isolated from the region of stable nuclei, but rather that both regions are instead linked through an isthmus of relatively stable deformed nuclei.

==Predicted decay properties==
The half-lives of nuclei in the island of stability itself are unknown since none of the nuclides that would be &quot;on the island&quot; have been observed. Many physicists believe that the half-lives of these nuclei are relatively short, on the order of minutes or days. Some theoretical calculations indicate that their half-lives may be long, on the order of 100 years, or possibly as long as 109 years.

The shell closure at &quot;N&quot; = 184 is predicted to result in longer partial half-lives for alpha decay and spontaneous fission. It is believed that the shell closure will result in higher fission barriers for nuclei around 298Fl, strongly hindering fission and perhaps resulting in fission half-lives 30 orders of magnitude greater than those of nuclei unaffected by the shell closure. For example, the neutron-deficient isotope 284Fl (with &quot;N&quot; = 170) undergoes fission with a half-life of 2.5 milliseconds, and is thought to be one of the most neutron-deficient nuclides with increased stability in the vicinity of the &quot;N&quot; = 184 shell closure. Beyond this point, some undiscovered isotopes are predicted to undergo fission with still shorter half-lives, limiting the existence and possible observation of superheavy nuclei far from the island of stability (namely for &quot;N&quot; &lt; 170 as well as for &quot;Z&quot; &gt; 120 and &quot;N&quot; &gt; 184). These nuclei may undergo alpha decay or spontaneous fission in microseconds or less, with some fission half-lives estimated on the order of 10−20 seconds in the absence of fission barriers. In contrast, 298Fl (predicted to lie within the region of maximum shell effects) may have a much longer spontaneous fission half-life, possibly on the order of 1019 years.

In the center of the island, there may be competition between alpha decay and spontaneous fission, though the exact ratio is model-dependent. The alpha decay half-lives of 1700 nuclei with 100 ≤ &quot;Z&quot; ≤ 130 have been calculated in a quantum tunneling model with both experimental and theoretical alpha decay Q-values, and are in agreement with observed half-lives for some of the heaviest isotopes.

The longest-lived nuclides are also predicted to lie on the beta-stability line, for beta decay is predicted to compete with the other decay modes near the predicted center of the island, especially for isotopes of elements 111–115. Unlike other decay modes predicted for these nuclides, beta decay does not change the mass number. Instead, a neutron is converted into a proton or vice versa, producing an adjacent isobar closer to the center of stability (the isobar with the lowest mass excess). For example, significant beta decay branches may exist in nuclides such as 291Fl and 291Nh; these nuclides have only a few more neutrons than known nuclides, and might decay via a &quot;narrow pathway&quot; towards the center of the island of stability. The possible role of beta decay is highly uncertain, as some isotopes of these elements (such as 290Fl and 293Mc) are predicted to have shorter partial half-lives for alpha decay. Beta decay would reduce competition and would result in alpha decay remaining the dominant decay channel, unless additional stability towards alpha decay exists in superdeformed isomers of these nuclides.
Considering all decay modes, various models indicate a shift of the center of the island (i.e., the longest-living nuclide) from 298Fl to a lower atomic number, and competition between alpha decay and spontaneous fission in these nuclides; these include 100-year half-lives for 291Cn and 293Cn, a 1000-year half-life for 296Cn, a 300-year half-life for 294Ds, and a 3500-year half-life for 293Ds, with 294Ds and 296Cn exactly at the &quot;N&quot; = 184 shell closure. It has also been posited that this region of enhanced stability for elements with 112 ≤ &quot;Z&quot; ≤ 118 may instead be a consequence of nuclear deformation, and that the true center of the island of stability for spherical superheavy nuclei lies around 306Ubb (&quot;Z&quot; = 122, &quot;N&quot; = 184). This model defines the island of stability as the region with the greatest resistance to fission rather than the longest total half-lives; the nuclide 306Ubb is still predicted to have a short half-life with respect to alpha decay. The island of stability for spherical nuclei may also be a &quot;coral reef&quot; (i.e., a broad region of increased stability without a clear &quot;peak&quot;) around &quot;N&quot; = 184 and 114 ≤ &quot;Z&quot; ≤ 120, with half-lives rapidly decreasing at higher atomic number, due to combined effects from proton and neutron shell closures.

Another potentially significant decay mode for the heaviest superheavy elements was proposed to be cluster decay by Romanian physicists Dorin N. Poenaru and Radu A. Gherghescu and German physicist Walter Greiner. Its branching ratio relative to alpha decay is expected to increase with atomic number such that it may compete with alpha decay around &quot;Z&quot; = 120, and perhaps become the dominant decay mode for heavier nuclides around &quot;Z&quot; = 124. As such, it is expected to play a larger role beyond the center of the island of stability (though still influenced by shell effects), unless the center of the island lies at a higher atomic number than predicted.

==Possible natural occurrence==

Even though half-lives of hundreds or thousands of years would be relatively long for superheavy elements, they are far too short for any such nuclides to exist primordially on Earth. Additionally, instability of nuclei intermediate between primordial actinides (232Th, 235U, and 238U) and the island of stability may inhibit production of nuclei within the island in &quot;r&quot;-process nucleosynthesis. Various models suggest that spontaneous fission will be the dominant decay mode of nuclei with &quot;A&quot; &gt; 280, and that neutron-induced or beta-delayed fission—respectively neutron capture and beta decay immediately followed by fission—will become the primary reaction channels. As a result, beta decay towards the island of stability may only occur within a very narrow path or may be entirely blocked by fission, thus precluding the synthesis of nuclides within the island. The non-observation of superheavy nuclides such as 292Hs and 298Fl in nature is thought to be a consequence of a low yield in the &quot;r&quot;-process resulting from this mechanism, as well as half-lives too short to allow measurable quantities to persist in nature. Various studies utilizing accelerator mass spectroscopy and crystal scintillators have reported upper limits of the natural abundance of such long-lived superheavy nuclei on the order of relative to their stable homologs.

Despite these obstacles to their synthesis, a 2013 study published by a group of Russian physicists led by Valeriy Zagrebaev proposes that the longest-lived copernicium isotopes may occur at an abundance of 10−12 relative to lead, whereby they may be detectable in cosmic rays. Similarly, in a 2013 experiment, a group of Russian physicists led by Aleksandr Bagulya reported the possible observation of three cosmogenic superheavy nuclei in olivine crystals in meteorites. The atomic number of these nuclei was estimated to be between 105 and 130, with one nucleus likely constrained between 113 and 129, and their lifetimes were estimated to be at least 3,000 years. Although this observation has yet to be confirmed in independent studies, it strongly suggests the existence of the island of stability, and is consistent with theoretical calculations of half-lives of these nuclides.

The decay of heavy, long-lived elements in the island of stability is a proposed explanation for the unusual presence of the short-lived radioactive isotopes observed in Przybylski&#x27;s Star.

==Synthesis and difficulties==

The manufacture of nuclei on the island of stability proves to be very difficult because the nuclei available as starting materials do not deliver the necessary sum of neutrons. Radioactive ion beams (such as 44S) in combination with actinide targets (such as 248Cm) may allow the production of more neutron rich nuclei nearer to the center of the island of stability, though such beams are not currently available in the required intensities to conduct such experiments. Several heavier isotopes such as 250Cm and 254Es may still be usable as targets, allowing the production of isotopes with one or two more neutrons than known isotopes, though the production of several milligrams of these rare isotopes to create a target is difficult. It may also be possible to probe alternative reaction channels in the same 48Ca-induced fusion-evaporation reactions that populate the most neutron-rich known isotopes, namely those at a lower excitation energy (resulting in fewer neutrons being emitted during de-excitation), or those involving evaporation of charged particles (&quot;pxn&quot;, evaporating a proton and several neutrons, or &quot;αxn&quot;, evaporating an alpha particle and several neutrons). This may allow the synthesis of neutron-enriched isotopes of elements 111–117. Although the predicted cross sections are on the order of 1–900 fb, smaller than when only neutrons are evaporated (&quot;xn&quot; channels), it may still be possible to generate otherwise unreachable isotopes of superheavy elements in these reactions. Some of these heavier isotopes (such as 291Mc, 291Fl, and 291Nh) may also undergo electron capture (converting a proton into a neutron) in addition to alpha decay with relatively long half-lives, decaying to nuclei such as 291Cn that are predicted to lie near the center of the island of stability. However, this remains largely hypothetical as no superheavy nuclei near the beta-stability line have yet been synthesized and predictions of their properties vary considerably across different models. In 2024, a team of researchers at the JINR observed one decay chain of the known isotope 289Mc as a product in the &quot;p2n&quot; channel of the reaction between 242Pu and 50Ti, an experiment targeting neutron-deficient livermorium isotopes. This was the first successful report of a charged-particle exit channel in a hot fusion reaction between an actinide target and a projectile with &quot;Z&quot; ≥ 20.

The process of slow neutron capture used to produce nuclides as heavy as 257Fm is blocked by short-lived isotopes of fermium that undergo spontaneous fission (for example, 258Fm has a half-life of 370 μs); this is known as the &quot;fermium gap&quot; and prevents the synthesis of heavier elements in such a reaction. It might be possible to bypass this gap, as well as another predicted region of instability around &quot;A&quot; = 275 and &quot;Z&quot; = 104–108, in a series of controlled nuclear explosions with a higher neutron flux (about a thousand times greater than fluxes in existing reactors) that mimics the astrophysical &quot;r&quot;-process. First proposed in 1972 by Meldner, such a reaction might enable the production of macroscopic quantities of superheavy elements within the island of stability; the role of fission in intermediate superheavy nuclides is highly uncertain, and may strongly influence the yield of such a reaction.

It may also be possible to generate isotopes in the island of stability such as 298Fl in multi-nucleon transfer reactions in low-energy collisions of actinide nuclei (such as 238U and 248Cm). This inverse quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission, with a shift away from mass equilibrium that results in more asymmetric products) mechanism may provide a path to the island of stability if shell effects around &quot;Z&quot; = 114 are sufficiently strong, though lighter elements such as nobelium and seaborgium (&quot;Z&quot; = 102–106) are predicted to have higher yields. Preliminary studies of the 238U + 238U and 238U + 248Cm transfer reactions have failed to produce elements heavier than mendelevium (&quot;Z&quot; = 101), though the increased yield in the latter reaction suggests that the use of even heavier targets such as 254Es (if available) may enable production of superheavy elements. This result is supported by a later calculation suggesting that the yield of superheavy nuclides (with &quot;Z&quot; ≤ 109) will likely be higher in transfer reactions using heavier targets. A 2018 study of the 238U + 232Th reaction at the Texas A&amp;M Cyclotron Institute by Sara Wuenschel et al. found several unknown alpha decays that may possibly be attributed to new, neutron-rich isotopes of superheavy elements with 104 &lt; &quot;Z&quot; &lt; 116, though further research is required to unambiguously determine the atomic number of the products. This result strongly suggests that shell effects have a significant influence on cross sections, and that the island of stability could possibly be reached in future experiments with transfer reactions.

==Other islands of stability==

Further shell closures beyond the main island of stability in the vicinity of &quot;Z&quot; = 112–114 may give rise to additional islands of stability. Although predictions for the location of the next magic numbers vary considerably, two significant islands are thought to exist around heavier doubly magic nuclei; the first near 354126 (with 228 neutrons) and the second near 472164 or 482164 (with 308 or 318 neutrons). Nuclides within these two islands of stability might be especially resistant to spontaneous fission and have alpha decay half-lives measurable in years, thus having comparable stability to elements in the vicinity of flerovium. Other regions of relative stability may also appear with weaker proton shell closures in beta-stable nuclides; such possibilities include regions near 342126 and 462154. Substantially greater electromagnetic repulsion between protons in such heavy nuclei may greatly reduce their stability, and possibly restrict their existence to localized islands in the vicinity of shell effects. This may have the consequence of isolating these islands from the main chart of nuclides, as intermediate nuclides and perhaps elements in a &quot;sea of instability&quot; would rapidly undergo fission and essentially be nonexistent. It is also possible that beyond a region of relative stability around element 126, heavier nuclei would lie beyond a fission threshold given by the liquid drop model and thus undergo fission with very short lifetimes, rendering them essentially nonexistent even in the vicinity of greater magic numbers.

It has also been posited that in the region beyond &quot;A&quot; &gt; 300, an entire &quot;continent of stability&quot; consisting of a hypothetical phase of stable quark matter, comprising freely flowing up and down quarks rather than quarks bound into protons and neutrons, may exist. Such a form of matter is theorized to be a ground state of baryonic matter with a greater binding energy per baryon than nuclear matter, favoring the decay of nuclear matter beyond this mass threshold into quark matter. If this state of matter exists, it could possibly be synthesized in the same fusion reactions leading to normal superheavy nuclei, and would be stabilized against fission as a consequence of its stronger binding that is enough to overcome Coulomb repulsion.

<text>The names for the chemical elements 104 to 106 were the subject of a major controversy starting in the 1960s, described by some nuclear chemists as the Transfermium Wars because it concerned the elements following fermium (element 100) on the periodic table.

This controversy arose from disputes between American scientists and Soviet scientists as to which had first isolated these elements. The final resolution of this controversy in 1997 also decided the names of elements 107 to 109.

== Controversy ==
By convention, naming rights for newly discovered chemical elements go to their discoverers. For elements 104, 105, and 106, there was a controversy between Soviet researchers at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and American researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory regarding which group had discovered them first. Both parties suggested their own names for elements 104 and 105, not recognizing the other&#x27;s name.

The American name of seaborgium for element 106 was also objectionable to some, because it referred to American chemist Glenn T. Seaborg who was still alive at the time this name was proposed. (Einsteinium and fermium had also been proposed as names of new elements while Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi were still living, but only made public after their deaths, due to Cold War secrecy.)

== Opponents ==
The two principal groups which were involved in the conflict over element naming were:
* An American group at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
* A Russian group at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna.

and, as a kind of arbiter,
* The IUPAC Commission on Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry, which introduced its own proposal to the IUPAC General Assembly.

The German group at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, who had (undisputedly) discovered elements 107 to 109, were dragged into the controversy when the Commission suggested that the name &quot;hahnium&quot;, proposed for element 105 by the Americans, be used for GSI&#x27;s element 108 instead.

===Proposals===

====Darmstadt====
The names suggested for the elements 107 to 109 by the German group were:

====IUPAC====
In 1994, the IUPAC Commission on Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry proposed the following names:

This attempted to resolve the dispute by sharing the namings of the disputed elements between Russians and Americans, replacing the name for 104 with one honoring the Dubna research center, and not naming 106 after Seaborg.

== Objections to the IUPAC 94 proposal ==
This solution drew objections from the American Chemical Society (ACS) on the grounds that the right of the American group to propose the name for element 106 was not in question, and that group should have the right to name the element. Indeed, IUPAC decided that the credit for the discovery of element 106 should be awarded to Berkeley.

Along the same lines, the German group protested against naming element 108 by the American suggestion &quot;hahnium&quot;, mentioning the long-standing convention that an element is named by its discoverers.
In addition, given that many American books had already used rutherfordium and hahnium for 104 and 105, the ACS objected to those names being used for other elements.

In 1995, IUPAC abandoned the controversial rule and established a committee of national representatives aimed at finding a compromise. They suggested &quot;seaborgium&quot; for element 106 in exchange for the removal of all the other American proposals, except for the established name &quot;lawrencium&quot; for element 103. The equally entrenched name &quot;nobelium&quot; for element 102 was replaced by &quot;flerovium&quot; after Georgy Flyorov, following the recognition by the 1993 report that that element had been first synthesized in Dubna. This was rejected by American scientists and the decision was retracted. The name &quot;flerovium&quot; was later used for element 114.

== Resolution (IUPAC 97) ==
In 1996, IUPAC held another meeting, reconsidered all names in hand, and accepted another set of recommendations; finally, it was approved and published in 1997 on the 39th IUPAC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. Element 105 was named &quot;dubnium&quot; (Db), after Dubna in Russia, the location of the JINR; the American suggestions were used for elements 102, 103, 104, and 106. The name &quot;dubnium&quot; had been used for element 104 in the previous IUPAC recommendation. The American scientists &quot;reluctantly&quot; approved this decision. IUPAC pointed out that the Berkeley laboratory had already been recognized several times, in the naming of berkelium, californium, and americium, and that the acceptance of the names &quot;rutherfordium&quot; and &quot;seaborgium&quot; for elements 104 and 106 should be offset by recognizing JINR&#x27;s contributions to the discovery of elements 104, 105, and 106.

The following names were agreed in 1997 on the 39th IUPAC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland:

Thus, the convention of the discoverer&#x27;s right to name their elements was respected for elements 106 to 109, and the two disputed claims were &quot;shared&quot; between the two opponents.

== Summary ==

In some countries, as Poland, Denmark, India, Indonesia prior to 1997 element 104 had a Soviet proposal kurchatovium and element 105 had an American proposal hahnium.

<text>Baden-Württemberg ( ; ), commonly shortened to BW or BaWü, is a German state () in Southwest Germany, east of the Rhine, which forms the southern part of Germany&#x27;s western border with France. With more than 11.07 million inhabitants across a total area of nearly , it is the third-largest German state by both area (behind Bavaria and Lower Saxony) and population (behind North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria). The largest city in Baden-Württemberg is the state capital of Stuttgart, followed by Mannheim and Karlsruhe. Other major cities are Freiburg im Breisgau, Heidelberg, Heilbronn, Konstanz, Pforzheim, Reutlingen, Tübingen, and Ulm.

Modern Baden-Württemberg includes the historical territories of Baden, Prussian Hohenzollern, and Württemberg. Baden-Württemberg became a state of West Germany in April 1952 through the merger of South Baden, Württemberg-Baden, and Württemberg-Hohenzollern. These states had been created by the Allies as they separated traditional states into occupation zones after World War II.

Baden-Württemberg is especially known for its strong economy with various industries like car manufacturing, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, the service sector, and more. It has the third-highest gross regional product (GRP) in Germany. Part of the Four Motors for Europe and located in the Blue Banana, some of the largest German companies are headquartered in Baden-Württemberg, including Mercedes-Benz Group, Schwarz Group, Porsche, Bosch and SAP.

The sobriquet , a diminutive of the word in the local Swabian, Alemannic and Franconian dialects, is sometimes used as a synonym for Baden-Württemberg.

==History==
Baden-Württemberg is formed from the historical territories of Württemberg, Baden and Prussian Hohenzollern. Baden spans along the flat right bank of the river Rhine from north-west to the south (Lake Constance) of the present state, whereas Württemberg and Hohenzollern lay more inland and hillier, including areas such as the Swabian Jura mountain range. The Black Forest formed part of the border between Baden and Württemberg.

In 100 AD, the Roman Empire invaded and occupied Württemberg, constructing a limes along its northern borders. Over the course of the third century AD, the Alemanni forced the Romans to retreat west beyond the Rhine and Danube rivers. In 496 AD the Alemanni were defeated by a Frankish invasion led by Clovis I.

The Holy Roman Empire was later established. The majority of people in this region continued to be Roman Catholics, even after the Protestant Reformation influenced populations in northern Germany.

In the late 18th and early 19th century, Künzelsau, the capital of the Hohenlohe district, became the centre of emigration to the UK of pork butchers and bacon factors. The pioneers noticed a niche for speciality pork products in the rapidly growing English cities, especially those in the industrial centre and North. Many married local women and sent word home that a good living could be made in England; others followed.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, numerous people emigrated from this primarily rural area to the United States for economic reasons.

===20th century to present===
At the beginning of the 20th century, the territory of modern-day Baden-Württemberg consisted of the Grand Duchy of Baden, the Kingdom of Württemberg and the province of Hohenzollern of the Kingdom of Prussia. Since 1871, these had been part of the German Empire. In the aftermath of World War I and as part of the German revolution of 1918, the monarchs of Baden, Württemberg and Prussia were deposed, and these states became democratic republics: the Republic of Baden, the Free People&#x27;s State of Württemberg and the Free State of Prussia.

Following Adolf Hitler becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933, the democratic institutions of Baden, Württemberg and Prussia were abolished as part of the &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;.

After World War II, the Allies established three states in the territory of modern-day Baden-Württemberg: (South) Baden, Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern. Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern were occupied by France, while Württemberg-Baden was occupied by the United States. The new artificial borders were a consequence of France requesting its own occupation zone in Germany after World War II, and the Americans&#x27; wish to keep the A8 motorway, which spans east-west across northern Baden and northern Württemberg, wholly within their occupation zone.

In 1949, each state became a founding member of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), with Article 118 of the German constitution providing an accession procedure. On 9 December 1951, a referendum was held in Württemberg-Baden, Württemberg-Hohenzollern and (South) Baden over a possible merger, or the restoration of the former pre-war states. There was strong support for the merger in Württemberg and Hohenzollern, but opposition in Baden. While a majority in the historic area of Baden (52%) voted to restore the former pre-war states, the majority of voters overall (69%) voted in favor of a merger. Baden-Württemberg officially became a state on 25 April 1952.

There were still opponents to the merger of Baden and Württemberg, however. In 1956 the Federal Constitutional Court decided that the population of Baden should have their say in a separate referendum. The second referendum was delayed, however, and the Federal Constitutional Court decided in 1969 that another referendum should be held by 30 June 1970. The referendum in the historic area of Baden was finally held on 7 June 1970, with 81.9% of the voters voting in favour of the merger of Baden and Württemberg.

==Geography==
Baden-Württemberg shares borders with the German states of Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, and Bavaria, and also shares borders with France (Alsace, within the region of Grand Est), and Switzerland (cantons of Basel-Landschaft, Basel-Stadt, Aargau, Zürich, Schaffhausen and Thurgau).

Most of the major cities of Baden-Württemberg straddle the banks of the Neckar River, which has its source in Villingen-Schwenningen and runs downstream (from southwest to the centre, then northwest) through the state past Tübingen, Stuttgart, Heilbronn, Heidelberg, and Mannheim.

The Rhine () forms the western border as well as large portions of the southern border. The Black Forest (Schwarzwald), the central mountain range of the state, rises east of the Upper Rhine valley. The high plateau of the Swabian Alb, between the Neckar, the Black Forest, and the Danube, is an essential European watershed. Baden-Württemberg shares Lake Constance (Bodensee, also known regionally as the Swabian Sea) with Switzerland, Austria and Bavaria, the international borders within its waters not being clearly defined. It shares the foothills of the Alps (known as the Allgäu) with Bavaria and the Austrian Vorarlberg, but Baden-Württemberg itself has no mainland border with Austria.

The Danube is conventionally taken to be formed by the confluence of the two streams Brigach and Breg just east of Donaueschingen.
The source of the Donaubach, which flows into the Danube, in Donaueschingen is often referred to as the &quot;source of the Danube&quot; (&quot;Donauquelle&quot;). Hydrologically, the source of the Danube is the source of the Breg as the larger of the two formative streams, which rises near Furtwangen.

The forests in this region are home to common pests such as &quot;Melolontha Hippocastrani&quot;, that cause damage to the foliage and soil.

==Climate==

Baden-Württemberg is – along with Bavaria – the southernmost part of Germany.

The climate across the states varies. This is mostly due to a high amount of mountains and highlands inside of the state. Most parts in the western parts (Baden) lower than enjoy an almost year round mild oceanic climate (cfb in Köppen classification). The climate in the eastern parts of the state is more continental. For instance, winters in the city of Ulm are colder than in Berlin. 
While winters in the warmest areas often lack snow, the Black Forest, Swabian Alb and the Alps tend to get snow frequently, especially in areas of high elevation. Summers here have more rain than in the valleys, but winters tend to have more sun.

Due to the differences of the landscapes, average annual temperatures reach from only in the microclimates of Black Forest and Allgäu up to in the Upper Rhine Valley.

==Government==
===Administration===




Baden-Württemberg is divided into thirty-five districts (&quot;Landkreise&quot;) and nine independent cities (&quot;Stadtkreise&quot;), both grouped into the four Administrative Districts () of Freiburg, Karlsruhe, Stuttgart, and Tübingen.

 The 35 districts:

Baden-Württemberg contains nine additional independent cities not belonging to any district:

====Other state institutions====
The Baden-Württemberg General Auditing Office acts as an independent body to monitor public offices&#x27; correct use of public funds.

===Politics===
The state parliament of Baden-Württemberg is the &quot;Landtag&quot;, located in Stuttgart. The state government is currently formed by a Greens-CDU coalition as the third cabinet of Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann (Greens).

The politics of Baden-Württemberg have traditionally been dominated by the conservative Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU), which had led all but one government since 1952 until 2011. In the &quot;Landtag&quot; elections held on 27 March 2011, voters replaced the Christian Democrats and centre-right Free Democrats (FDP) coalition with an alliance of the Greens and Social Democrats (SPD), which secured a four-seat majority in the state parliament. The alliance elected the Greens-led first Kretschmann cabinet under Winfried Kretschmann because the Greens had surprisingly won 36 seats, one more than the Social Democrats&#x27; 35 seats. In the 2016 election, the popular Kretschmann and his Greens were reelected and, with their nationwide best result, turned out first place for the first time in any election in German history. However, because of the Social Democrats&#x27; heavy losses, the Greens formed a coalition government with the Christian Democrats, the second Kretschmann cabinet. After the most recent election in 2021, the Greens-CDU coalition was upheld.

==Economy==

Although Baden-Württemberg has relatively few natural resources compared to other regions of Germany, the state is among the most prosperous and wealthiest regions in Europe with a generally low unemployment rate historically. The state&#x27;s economic performance benefits from and relies on its well-developed infrastructure. Apart from the city-states of Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg, Baden-Württemberg offers the fourth-shortest routes to trains and buses on average among all German states. Despite it not being predominantly reliant upon an industrial capacity, Baden-Württemberg is regarded as one of the most strongest economic states in Germany.

Baden-Württemberg has the highest exports (2019) and third-highest imports (2020), the second-lowest unemployment rate with 4.3% (March 2021), the most patents pending per capita (2020), the second-highest absolute and highest relative number of companies considered &quot;hidden champions&quot;, and the highest absolute and relative research and development expenditure (2017) among all states in Germany, as well as the highest measured Innovationsindex (2012), making it the German state with the third-highest gross regional product (GRP) (behind North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria) with €524,325 billion (around US$636.268 billion). Baden-Württemberg also has the most employees (233,296) in the automotive industry of all German states , as well as the third-highest number of motor vehicles of all German states (2020). If Baden-Württemberg were a sovereign country (2020), it would have an economy comparable to that of Sweden in terms of nominal gross domestic product (GDP).

A number of well-known enterprises are headquartered in the state, for example Mercedes-Benz Group, Porsche, Robert Bosch GmbH (automobile industry), Carl Zeiss AG (optics), SAP (Europe&#x27;s most valuable brand as well as the largest non-American software enterprise) and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen (precision mechanical engineering). Despite this, Baden-Württemberg&#x27;s economy is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises, like most companies in German-speaking countries are. Although poor in workable natural resources (formerly lead, zinc, iron, silver, copper, and salts) and still very rural in some areas, the region is heavily industrialised overall. In 2003, there were almost 8,800 manufacturing enterprises with more than 20 employees, but only 384 with more than 500. There are 3,779 companies in Baden-Württemberg corporate family which come to 1000–5000 employees in total.

The latter category accounts for 43% of the 1.2 million persons employed in the industry. The &quot;Mittelstand&quot; or mid-sized company model is the backbone of the Baden-Württemberg economy. Medium-sized businesses and a tradition of branching into different industrial sectors have ensured specialisation over a wide range. A fifth of the &quot;old&quot; Federal Republic&#x27;s industrial gross value added is generated by Baden-Württemberg. Turnover for manufacturing in 2003 exceeded 240,000 million, 43% of which came from exports. The region depends to some extent on global economic developments, though the great adaptability of the region&#x27;s economy has generally helped it through crises. Half of the employees in the manufacturing industry are in mechanical and electrical engineering and automobile construction. This is also where the largest enterprises are to be found. The importance of the precision mechanics industry also extends beyond the region&#x27;s borders, as does that of the optical, clock making, toy, metallurgy and electronics industries. The textile industry, which formerly dominated much of the region, has disappeared from Baden-Württemberg. Research and development (R&amp;D) is funded jointly by the state and industry. In 2001, more than a fifth of the 100,000 or so persons working in R&amp;D in Germany were located in Baden-Württemberg, most of them in the Stuttgart area. Baden-Württemberg is also the region with the highest GDP of the Four Motors for Europe.

A study performed in 2007 by the neo-liberal thinktank Initiative for New Social Market Economy and the trade newspaper &quot;Wirtschaftswoche&quot; awarded Baden-Württemberg for being the &quot;economically most successful and most dynamic state&quot; among the 16 states.

The unemployment rate stood at 3% in October 2018 and was the second lowest in Germany behind only Bavaria and one of the lowest in the European Union.
===Tourism===
Baden-Württemberg is a popular holiday destination. Main sights include the capital and biggest city, Stuttgart, modern and historical at the same time, with its urban architecture and atmosphere (and famously, its inner-city parks and historic Wilhelma zoo), its castles (such as Castle Solitude), its museums as well as a rich cultural programme (theatre, opera) and mineral spring baths in Bad Cannstatt (also the site of a Roman Castra); it is the only major city in Germany with vineyards in an urban territory.

The residential (court) towns of Ludwigsburg and Karlsruhe, the spas and casino of luxurious Baden-Baden, the medieval architecture of Ulm (Ulm Münster is the tallest church in the world), the vibrant, young, but traditional university towns of Heidelberg and Tübingen with their old castles looking out above the river Neckar, are popular smaller towns. Sites of former monasteries such as the ones on Reichenau Island and at Maulbronn (both World Heritage Sites) as well as Bebenhausen Abbey are to be found. Baden-Württemberg also boasts rich old Free Imperial Cities such as Biberach, Esslingen am Neckar, Heilbronn, Ravensburg, Reutlingen, Künzelsau, Schwäbisch Hall and Aalen as well as the southernmost and sunniest city of Germany, Freiburg, close to Alsace and Switzerland, being an ideal base for exploring the heights of the nearby Black Forest (e.g., for skiing in winter or for hiking in summer) with its traditional villages and the surrounding wine country of the Rhine Valley of South Baden.

The countryside of the lush Upper Neckar valley (where Rottweil is famous for its &quot;Fastnacht&quot; carnival) and the pristine Danube valley Swabian Alb (with Hohenzollern Castle and Sigmaringen Castle), as well as the largely pristine Swabian Forest, the Upper Rhine Valley, and Lake Constance, where all kinds of water sports are popular, with the former Imperial, today border town of Konstanz (where the Council of Constance took place), the Neolithic and Bronze Age village at Unteruhldingen, the flower island of Mainau, and the hometown of the Zeppelin, Friedrichshafen a.o., are especially popular for outdoor activities in the summer months.

In spring and autumn (April/May and September/October), beer festivals (fun fairs) take place at the Cannstatter Wasen in Stuttgart. The Cannstatter Volksfest, in the autumn, is the second-largest such festival in the world after the Munich Oktoberfest. In late November and early December Christmas markets are a tourist magnet in all major towns, the largest being in Stuttgart during the three weeks before Christmas.

The Bertha Benz Memorial Route is a 194 km signposted scenic route from Mannheim via Heidelberg and Wiesloch to Pforzheim and back, which follows the route of the world&#x27;s first long-distance journey by automobile which Bertha Benz undertook in August 1888.

Baden-Württemberg also is home to Europa-Park in Rust. The largest theme park in Germany, and the second most popular theme park in Europe, after Disneyland Paris.

==Education==

Baden-Württemberg is home to some of the oldest, most renowned, and prestigious universities in Germany, such as the universities of Heidelberg (founded in 1386, the oldest university within the territory of modern Germany), Freiburg (founded in 1457), and Tübingen (founded in 1477). It also contains three of the eleven German &quot;excellence universities&quot; (Heidelberg, Tübingen, Konstanz and Karlsruhe and formerly, Freiburg ).

Other university towns are Mannheim and Ulm. Furthermore, two universities are located in the state capital Stuttgart, the University of Hohenheim, and the University of Stuttgart. Ludwigsburg is home to the national film school Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg (Film Academy Baden-Wuerttemberg). The private International University in Germany was situated in Bruchsal, but closed in 2009. Another private university is located in Friedrichshafen, Zeppelin University.

Furthermore, there are more than a dozen , i.e., universities of applied sciences, as well as &quot;Pädagogische Hochschulen&quot;, i.e., teacher training colleges, and other institutions of tertiary education in Baden-Württemberg. Pforzheim University is one of the oldest Fachhochschulen in Germany which is renowned and highly ranked for its engineering and MBA programs.

The state has the highest density of universities of any state in Germany.

== Transport ==
=== Railway ===


Railways form a major part of the transport infrastructure in Baden-Württemberg. As of 2017, the main standard gauge railway network managed by DB Netz consists of about of railway lines connecting all major settlements of the state, with about 6,500 trains operating every day. As part of high-speed rail in Germany, the Mannheim–Stuttgart and Stuttgart–Ulm high-speed lines were built, and the Karlsruhe–Basel high-speed line, paralleling the traditional Mannheim–Karlsruhe–Basel railway, is currently under construction. In and around Stuttgart, the old terminal station is currently being replaced with an underground through station as part of the controversial Stuttgart 21 project.

Local branch lines of around , managed by the state-owned SWEG and Hohenzollerische Landesbahn (HzL), Karlsruhe-owned Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (AVG), private Württembergische Eisenbahn (WEG) and other smaller rail infrastructure operators, complete the state&#x27;s railway infrastructure.

Passenger train services in Baden-Württemberg are operated partly by various subsidiaries of Deutsche Bahn, the national railway operator, such as DB Fernverkehr with its high-speed ICE, as well as IC trains; and DB Regio, operating some regional train services in the state. Cross-border train services are also provided by French Railways&#x27; TGV trains, as well as by Swiss Federal Railways and Austrian Federal Railways (including its Nightjet night trains).

Since the 1990s, the around 120 individual regional train services in Baden-Württemberg have been managed by the state-owned Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Baden-Württemberg (NVBW), which has started to commercially tender out these train operations. DB Regio, SWEG, HzL, AVG and WEG have been joined in operating regional trains by Abellio, Agilis, Bodensee-Oberschwaben-Bahn, Go-Ahead, SBB, Schwäbische Alb-Bahn and VIAS, which entered the market.

Starting in the 1970s, regional rail around major cities has been transformed into high-frequent S-Bahn networks, currently the following systems exist (partly) in Baden-Württemberg: Stuttgart S-Bahn, Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn, Breisgau S-Bahn and Basel S-Bahn. In and around the cities of Karlsruhe and Heilbronn, the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn system combines elements of traditional S-Bahns with tram operations within the urban cores (tram-trains).

Historically, the railway system in Baden-Württemberg was developed at first by the state&#x27;s predecessors&#x27; state railways: the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway opened its first railway line between Mannheim and Heidelberg on 12 September 1840; uniquely in Germany, it used a broad gauge of in its early years. In Württemberg, the Royal State Railways opened their first line on 22 October 1845 between two present-day suburbs of Stuttgart. In 1900, the Hohenzollerische Landesbahn (HzL) was founded to expand the rail system in the Prussian province, which had previously only been served by short sections of Württemberg lines passing through &quot;foreign&quot; territory. After the construction of the main lines, various private or local government initiatives constructed branch or local railway lines, some of which survive today as AVG, SWEG, RNV or WEG lines. In 1920, the Baden and Württemberg state railways merged with other state railways to form Deutsche Reichsbahn, which was replaced by Deutsche Bundesbahn after World War II. A lot of smaller railway lines, both DB and remaining local or private lines, closed in the decades after World War II, or were at least run-down with minimal service for passengers. Since the 1990s, some of these lines have been revived and revitalised marking good examples for increased ridership through attractive trains and timetables, with some examples being the Kraichgau Railway (taken over by AVG) and the Schönbuch Railway (reopened by WEG).

A popular TV programme portraying railways around Germany and the world, &quot;Eisenbahn-Romantik&quot;, originates in Baden-Württemberg and is produced by its public broadcaster SWR.

=== Urban public transport ===


Baden-Württemberg&#x27;s area is covered by 19 &quot;Verkehrsverbünde&quot; (transport associations), organising and managing local public transport, as well as ensuring harmonised fares between different bus and train operators. For inter-&quot;Verbünde&quot; journeys, the &quot;bwtarif&quot;, created in 2018, offers seamless tickets across the state.

As of 2023, tram and light rail systems exist in Freiburg, Heidelberg, Heilbronn, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Stuttgart and Ulm. International tram lines also reach Baden-Württemberg: Basel&#x27;s tram 8 serves Weil am Rhein, while Strasbourg&#x27;s tram D extends to Kehl. There is also a trolleybus system in Esslingen am Neckar.

==Demographics==

The population of Baden-Württemberg was 10,486,660 in 2014, of which 5,354,105 were female and 5,132,555 male. In 2006, the birth rate of 8.61 per 1000 was almost equal to the death rate of 8.60 per 1000. 14.87 percent of the population was under the age of 15, whereas the proportion of people aged 65 and older was at 18.99 per cent (2008). The dependency ratio–the ratio of people aged under 15 and over 64 in comparison to the working-age population (aged 15–64)–was 512 per 1000 (2008). In 2018, Baden-Württemberg ranked 2 on the Human Development Index (HDI) among all states in Germany, after Hamburg. With an average life expectancy of 79.8 years for men and 84.2 years for women (2017–2019 life table), Baden-Württemberg ranks first in this category among all states in Germany for both sexes.

Baden-Württemberg has long been a preferred destination of immigrants. , almost 28% of its population had a migration background as defined by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany; this number clearly surpassed the German average of 21% and was higher than in any other German state with the exception of the city states of Hamburg and Bremen. , 9,355,239 of the population held German citizenship, whereas 1,131,421 were foreign nationals.

===Religion===

Northern and most of central Württemberg has been traditionally Protestant (particularly Lutheran) since the Reformation in 1534 (with its centre at the famous Tübinger Stift). The former Electorate of the Palatinate (Northwestern Baden) with its capital Heidelberg was shaped by Calvinism before being integrated into Baden. Upper Swabia, and the Upper Neckar Valley up to the bishop seat of Rottenburg, and Southern Baden (the Catholic archbishop has its seat in Freiburg) have traditionally been bastions of Roman Catholicism. Catholics have a very narrow plurality in the state, with 6% of the population adhering to Islam and 24% of the population disclaiming any religion or adhering to other faiths.

=== Dialects ===
Alemannic and Franconian dialects of German are spoken in Baden-Württemberg. Slightly different variants of the Alemannic dialect Swabian are spoken in central and southern Württemberg, including in Upper Swabia, the Swabian Alb, and the central Neckar Valley of the Stuttgart region. In South Baden, the local dialects are Low Alemannic and High Alemannic (i.e., variants of what is also Swiss German). In the northern part of Baden, i.e., the area around Karlsruhe, Heilbronn and Mosbach, South Franconian dialects are predominant. In the &quot;Kurpfalz&quot;, however, with the cities of Heidelberg and Mannheim, the idiom is Rhine Franconian (i.e., Palatinate German), while in the Northeast of Baden-Württemberg East Franconian is spoken.

The same or similar Alemannic dialects are also spoken in the neighboring regions, especially in Bavarian Swabia, Alsace (Alsatian), German-speaking Switzerland (Swiss German), and the Austrian Vorarlberg. In contrast, the other Franconian dialects range from the Netherlands over the Rhineland, Lorraine, and Hesse up to Franconia in northern Bavaria.

Yiddish and Pleißne were spoken while Romani is still being used by some.

A variant of the Alemannic German of Baden developed into the Colonia Tovar dialect, spoken by descendants of immigrants from Baden who went to Venezuela in 1843.

<doc id="66402" wikidata="Q875738" url="?curid=66402" title="Brown v. Board of Education">
<text>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional, even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality. The decision partially overruled the Court&#x27;s 1896 decision &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, which had held that racial segregation laws did not violate the U.S. Constitution as long as the facilities for each race were equal in quality, a doctrine that had come to be known as &quot;separate but equal&quot;. The Court&#x27;s unanimous decision in &quot;Brown&quot;, and its related cases, paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights movement, and a model for many future impact litigation cases.

The case began in 1951 when the public school system in Topeka, Kansas, refused to enroll the daughter of local black resident Oliver Brown at the school closest to their home, instead requiring her to ride a bus to a segregated black school farther away. The Browns and twelve other local black families in similar situations filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S. federal court against the Topeka Board of Education, alleging its segregation policy was unconstitutional. A special three-judge court of the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas heard the case and ruled against the Browns, relying on the precedent of &quot;Plessy&quot; and its &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine. The Browns, represented by NAACP chief counsel Thurgood Marshall, appealed the ruling directly to the Supreme Court.

In May 1954, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 9–0 decision in favor of the Browns. The Court ruled that &quot;separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,&quot; and therefore laws that impose them violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the decision&#x27;s 14 pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court&#x27;s second decision in &quot;Brown II&quot; (1955) only ordered states to desegregate &quot;with all deliberate speed&quot;.

In the Southern United States, the reaction to &quot;Brown&quot; among most white people was &quot;noisy and stubborn&quot;, especially in the Deep South where racial segregation was deeply entrenched in society. Many Southern governmental and political leaders embraced a plan known as &quot;massive resistance&quot;, created by Senator Harry F. Byrd, in order to frustrate attempts to force them to de-segregate their school systems. Four years later, in the case of &quot;Cooper v. Aaron&quot;, the Court reaffirmed its ruling in &quot;Brown&quot;, and explicitly stated that state officials and legislators had no power to nullify its ruling.

==Background==
For much of the 60 years preceding the &quot;Brown&quot; case, race relations in the United States had been dominated by racial segregation. Such state policies had been endorsed by the United States Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896), which held that as long as the separate facilities for separate races were equal, state segregation did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause (&quot;no State shall ... deny to any person ... the equal protection of the laws&quot;). Racial segregation in education varied widely from the 17 states that required racial segregation to the 16 in which it was prohibited. Beginning in the 1930s, a legal strategy was pursued, led by scholars at Howard University and activists at the NAACP, that sought to undermine states&#x27; public education segregation by first focusing on the graduate school setting. This led to success in the cases of &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot;, 339 U.S. 629 (1950) and &quot;McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents&quot;, 339 U.S. 637 (1950), suggesting that racial segregation was inherently unequal (at least in some settings), which paved the way for &quot;Brown&quot;.

The plaintiffs in &quot;Brown&quot; asserted that the system of racial separation in all schools, while masquerading as providing separate but equal treatment of both white and black Americans, instead perpetuated inferior accommodations, services, and treatment for black Americans. &quot;Brown&quot; was influenced by UNESCO&#x27;s 1950 Statement, signed by a wide variety of internationally renowned scholars, titled &quot;The Race Question&quot;. This declaration denounced previous attempts at scientifically justifying racism as well as morally condemning racism. Another work that the Supreme Court cited was Gunnar Myrdal&#x27;s &quot;An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy&quot; (1944). Myrdal had been a signatory of the UNESCO declaration.

The United States and the Soviet Union were both at the height of the Cold War during this time, and U.S. officials, including Supreme Court justices, were highly aware of the harm that segregation and racism were doing to America&#x27;s international image. When Justice William O. Douglas traveled to India in 1950, the first question he was asked was, &quot;Why does America tolerate the lynching of Negroes?&quot; Douglas later wrote that he had learned from his travels that &quot;the attitude of the United States toward its colored minorities is a powerful factor in our relations with India.&quot; Chief Justice Earl Warren, nominated to the Supreme Court by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, echoed Douglas&#x27;s concerns in a 1954 speech to the American Bar Association, proclaiming that &quot;Our American system like all others is on trial both at home and abroad, ... the extent to which we maintain the spirit of our constitution with its Bill of Rights, will in the long run do more to make it both secure and the object of adulation than the number of hydrogen bombs we stockpile.&quot;

==District court case==

===Filing and arguments===
In 1951, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the Board of Education of the City of Topeka, Kansas, in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The plaintiffs were thirteen Topeka parents on behalf of their 20 children.

The suit called for the school district to reverse its policy of racial segregation. The Topeka Board of Education operated separate elementary schools due to a 1879 Kansas law, which permitted (but did not require) districts to maintain separate elementary school facilities for black and white students in 12 communities with populations over 15,000. The plaintiffs had been recruited by the leadership of the Topeka NAACP. Notable among the Topeka NAACP leaders were the chairman McKinley Burnett; Charles Scott, one of three serving as legal counsel for the chapter; and Lucinda Todd.

The named African-American plaintiff, Oliver Brown, was a parent, a welder in the shops of the Santa Fe Railroad, as well as an assistant pastor at his local church. He was convinced to join the lawsuit by a childhood friend, Charles Scott. Brown&#x27;s daughter Linda Carol Brown, a third grader, had to walk six blocks to her school bus stop to ride to Monroe Elementary, her segregated black school away, while Sumner Elementary, a white school, was seven blocks from her house.

As directed by the NAACP leadership, the parents each attempted to enroll their children in the closest neighborhood school in the fall of 1951. They were each refused enrollment and redirected to the segregated schools.

The case &quot;Oliver Brown et al. v. The Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas&quot; was named after Oliver Brown as a legal strategy to have a man at the head of the roster. The lawyers, and the National Chapter of the NAACP, also felt that having Mr. Brown at the head of the roster would be better received by the U.S. Supreme Court justices. The 13 plaintiffs were: Oliver Brown, Darlene Brown, Lena Carper, Sadie Emmanuel, Marguerite Emerson, Shirley Fleming, Zelma Henderson, Shirley Hodison, Maude Lawton, Alma Lewis, Iona Richardson, Vivian Scales, and Lucinda Todd. The last surviving plaintiff, Zelma Henderson, died in Topeka, on May 20, 2008, at age 88.

===District court opinion===
The District Court ruled in favor of the Board of Education, citing the U.S. Supreme Court precedent set in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;. Judge Walter Huxman wrote the opinion for the three-judge District Court panel, including nine &quot;findings of fact,&quot; based on the evidence presented at trial. Although finding number eight stated that segregation in public education has a detrimental effect on negro children, the court denied relief on the ground that the negro and white schools in Topeka were substantially equal with respect to buildings, transportation, curricula, and educational qualifications of teachers. This finding would be specifically cited in the subsequent Supreme Court opinion of this case.

==Supreme Court arguments==
The case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; as heard before the Supreme Court combined five cases: &quot;Brown&quot; itself, &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot; (filed in South Carolina), &quot;Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County&quot; (filed in Virginia), &quot;Gebhart v. Belton&quot; (filed in Delaware), and &quot;Bolling v. Sharpe&quot; (filed in Washington, D.C.).

All were NAACP-sponsored cases. The &quot;Davis&quot; case, the only case of the five originating from a student protest, began when 16-year-old Barbara Rose Johns organized and led a 450-student walkout of Moton High School. The &quot;Gebhart&quot; case was the only one where a trial court, affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court, found that discrimination was unlawful; in all the other cases the plaintiffs had lost as the original courts had found discrimination to be lawful.

The Kansas case was unique among the group in that there was no contention of gross inferiority of the segregated schools&#x27; physical plant, curriculum, or staff. The district court found substantial equality as to all such factors. The lower court, in its opinion, noted that, in Topeka, &quot;the physical facilities, the curricula, courses of study, qualification and quality of teachers, as well as other educational facilities in the two sets of schools [were] comparable.&quot; The lower court observed that &quot;colored children in many instances are required to travel much greater distances than they would be required to travel could they attend a white school&quot; but also noted that the school district &quot;transports colored children to and from school free of charge&quot; and that &quot;no such service [was] provided to white children.&quot; In the Delaware case the district court judge in &quot;Gebhart&quot; ordered that the black students be admitted to the white high school due to the substantial harm of segregation and the differences that made the separate schools unequal.

Under the leadership of Walter Reuther, the United Auto Workers donated $75,000 to help pay for the NAACP&#x27;s efforts at the Supreme Court. The NAACP&#x27;s chief counsel, Thurgood Marshall—who was later appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967—argued the case before the Supreme Court for the plaintiffs. Assistant attorney general Paul Wilson—later distinguished emeritus professor of law at the University of Kansas—conducted the state&#x27;s ambivalent defense in his first appellate argument.

In December 1952, the Justice Department filed an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; (&quot;friend of the court&quot;) brief in the case. The brief was unusual in its heavy emphasis on foreign-policy considerations of the Truman administration in a case ostensibly about domestic issues. Of the seven pages covering &quot;the interest of the United States,&quot; five focused on the way school segregation hurt the United States in the Cold War competition for the friendship and allegiance of non-white peoples in countries then gaining independence from colonial rule. Attorney General James P. McGranery noted that &quot;the existence of discrimination against minority groups in the United States has an adverse effect upon our relations with other countries. Racial discrimination furnishes grist for the Communist propaganda mills.&quot; The brief also quoted a letter by Secretary of State Dean Acheson lamenting that &quot;the United States is under constant attack in the foreign press, over the foreign radio, and in such international bodies as the United Nations because of various practices of discrimination in this country.&quot;

British barrister and parliamentarian Anthony Lester has written that &quot;Although the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Brown&quot; made no reference to these considerations of foreign policy, there is no doubt that they significantly influenced the decision.&quot;

===Consensus building===

In spring 1953, the court heard the case, but was unable to decide the issue and asked to rehear the case in fall 1953, with special attention to whether the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause prohibited the operation of separate public schools for whites and blacks.

Conference notes and draft decisions illustrate the division of opinions before the decision was issued. Justices William O. Douglas, Hugo Black, Harold Hitz Burton, and Sherman Minton were predisposed to overturn &quot;Plessy&quot;. Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not adopted desegregation legislation; Stanley F. Reed discussed incomplete cultural assimilation and states&#x27; rights, and was inclined to the view that segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; Tom C. Clark wrote that &quot;we had led the states on to think segregation is OK and we should let them work it out.&quot; Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to judicial activism and expressed concerns about the proposed decision&#x27;s enforceability. Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as Chief Justice. Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school systems following &quot;Mendez v. Westminster&quot;. However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a White House dinner, where the president told him: &quot;These [southern whites] are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes.&quot; Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African-American plaintiffs.

While all but one justice personally rejected segregation, the judicial restraint faction questioned whether the Constitution gave the court the power to order its end. The activist faction believed the Fourteenth Amendment did give the necessary authority and were pushing to go ahead. Warren, who held only a recess appointment, held his tongue until the Senate confirmed his appointment.

Warren convened a meeting of the justices, and presented to them the simple argument that the only reason to sustain segregation was an honest belief in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted that the court must overrule &quot;Plessy&quot; to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of liberty, and it must do so unanimously to avoid massive Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion. Although most justices were immediately convinced, Warren spent some time after this famous speech convincing everyone to sign onto the opinion. Justice Jackson dropped his concurrence and Reed finally decided to drop his dissent. The final decision was unanimous. Warren drafted the basic opinion and kept circulating and revising it until he had an opinion endorsed by all the members of the court. Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.

==Supreme Court decision==

On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 9–0 decision in favor of the Brown family and the other plaintiffs. The decision consists of a single opinion written by chief justice Earl Warren, which all the justices joined.

The Court&#x27;s opinion began by discussing whether the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted in 1868, was meant to abolish segregation in public education. The Court said that it had been unable to reach a conclusion on the question, even after hearing a second round of oral arguments from the parties&#x27; lawyers specifically on the historical sources.

The Court said the question was complicated by the major social and governmental changes that had taken place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It observed that public schools had been uncommon in the American South in the late 1860s. At that time, Southern white children whose families could afford schooling usually attended private schools, while the education of Southern black children was &quot;almost nonexistent&quot;, to the point that in some Southern states the education of black people was forbidden by law. The Court contrasted this with the situation in 1954: &quot;Today, education is perhaps the most important function of our local and state governments.&quot; The Court concluded that, in making its ruling, it would have to &quot;consider public education in light of its full development and its present place in American life throughout the Nation.&quot;

During the segregation era, it was common for black schools to have fewer resources and poorer facilities than white schools despite the equality required by the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine. The &quot;Brown&quot; Court did not address this issue, however, probably because some of the school districts involved in the case had improved their black schools in order to &quot;equalize&quot; them with the quality of the white schools. This prevented the Court from finding a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause in &quot;measurable inequalities&quot; between all white and black schools and forced the Court to look to the effects of segregation itself. The Court therefore framed the case around the more general question of whether the principle of &quot;separate but equal&quot; was constitutional when applied to public education. 

In answer, the Court held that it did. The Court ruled that state-mandated segregation, even if implemented in schools of otherwise equal quality, is inherently unequal because of its psychological effect upon the segregated children.

The Court supported this conclusion with citations—in a footnote, not the main text of the opinion—to several psychological studies concluding that segregating black children made them feel inferior and interfered with their learning. These studies included those of Kenneth and Mamie Clark, whose experiments in the 1940s had suggested that black American children from segregated environments preferred white dolls over black dolls.

The Court then concluded its relatively short opinion by declaring that segregated public education was inherently unequal, violated the Equal Protection Clause, and therefore was unconstitutional:

The Court did not close with an order to implement the integration of the schools of the various jurisdictions. Instead, it requested the parties re-appear before the Court the following Term to hold arguments on what the appropriate remedy should be. This became the case known as &quot;Brown II&quot;, described below.

==Reaction and aftermath==
Americans mostly cheered the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown&quot;, but most white Southerners decried it. Many white Southerners viewed &quot;Brown&quot; as &quot;a day of catastrophe—a Black Monday—a day something like Pearl Harbor.&quot; In the face of entrenched Southern opposition, progress on integrating American schools was slow. The American political historian Robert G. McCloskey described:

In Virginia, Senator Harry F. Byrd organized the Massive Resistance movement that included the closing of schools rather than desegregating them.

For several decades after the &quot;Brown&quot; decision, African-American teachers, principals, and other school staff who worked in segregated Black schools were fired or laid off as Southerners sought to create a system of integrated schools with White leadership. According to historian Michael Fultz, &quot;In many ways the South moved faster, with more &#x27;deliberate speed&#x27; in displacing Black educators than it did in desegregating schools.&quot;

===Deep South===
Texas Attorney General John Ben Shepperd organized a campaign to generate legal obstacles to the implementation of desegregation.

In September 1957, Arkansas governor Orval Faubus called out the Arkansas Army National Guard to block the entry of nine black students, later known as the &quot;Little Rock Nine&quot; after the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School. President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded by asserting federal control over the Arkansas National Guard and deploying troops from the U.S. Army&#x27;s 101st Airborne Division stationed at Fort Campbell to ensure the black students could safely register for and attend classes.

Also in 1957, Florida&#x27;s response was mixed. Its legislature passed an Interposition Resolution denouncing the decision and declaring it null and void. But Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, though joining in the protest against the court decision, refused to sign it, arguing that the attempt to overturn the ruling must be done by legal methods.

In Mississippi, fear of violence prevented any plaintiff from bringing a school desegregation suit for the next nine years. When Medgar Evers sued in 1963 to desegregate schools in Jackson, Mississippi, White Citizens Council member Byron De La Beckwith murdered him. Two subsequent trials resulted in hung juries. Beckwith was not convicted of the murder until 1994.

In June 1963, Alabama governor George Wallace personally blocked the door to the University of Alabama&#x27;s Foster Auditorium to prevent the enrollment of two black students in what became known as the &quot;Stand in the Schoolhouse Door&quot; incident. Wallace sought to uphold his &quot;segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever&quot; promise he had given in his 1963 inaugural address. Wallace moved aside only when confronted by General Henry V. Graham of the Alabama National Guard, whom President John F. Kennedy had ordered to intervene.

Native American communities were also heavily impacted by segregation laws with native children also being prohibited from attending white institutions. Native American children considered light-complexioned were allowed to ride school buses to previously all white schools, while dark-skinned Native children from the same band were still barred from riding the same buses. Tribal leaders, having learned about Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s desegregation campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, contacted him for assistance. King promptly responded to the tribal leaders and through his intervention the problem was quickly resolved.

===Upper South===
In North Carolina, there was often a strategy of nominally accepting &quot;Brown&quot;, but tacitly resisting it. On May 18, 1954, the Greensboro, North Carolina school board declared that it would abide by the &quot;Brown&quot; ruling. This was the result of the initiative of D. E. Hudgins Jr., a former Rhodes Scholar and prominent attorney, who chaired the school board. This made Greensboro the first, and for years the only, city in the South, to announce its intent to comply. However, others in the city resisted integration, putting up legal obstacles to the actual implementation of school desegregation for years afterward, and in 1969, the federal government found the city was not in compliance with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Transition to a fully integrated school system did not begin until 1971, after numerous local lawsuits and both nonviolent and violent demonstrations. Historians have noted the irony that Greensboro, which had heralded itself as such a progressive city, was one of the last holdouts for school desegregation.

In Moberly, Missouri, the schools were desegregated, as ordered. However, after 1955, the African-American teachers from the local &quot;negro school&quot; were not retained; this was ascribed to poor performance. They appealed their dismissal in &quot;Naomi Brooks et al., Appellants, v. School District of City of Moberly, Missouri, Etc., et al.&quot;; but it was upheld, and SCOTUS declined to hear a further appeal.

Virginia had one of the companion cases in &quot;Brown&quot;, involving the Prince Edward County schools. Significant opposition to the &quot;Brown&quot; verdict included U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, who led the Byrd Organization and promised a strategy of Massive Resistance. Governor Thomas Stanley, a member of the Byrd Organization, appointed the Gray Commission, 32 Democrats led by state senator Garland Gray, to study the issue and make recommendations. The commission recommended giving localities &quot;broad discretion&quot; in meeting the new judicial requirements. However, in 1956, a special session of the Virginia legislature adopted a legislative package which allowed the governor to simply close all schools under desegregation orders from federal courts. In early 1958, newly elected Governor J. Lindsay Almond closed public schools in Charlottesville, Norfolk, and Warren County rather than comply with desegregation orders, leaving 10,000 children without schools despite efforts of various parent groups. However, he reconsidered when on the Lee-Jackson state holiday, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled the closures violated the state constitution, and a panel of federal judges ruled they violated the U.S. Constitution. In early February 1959, both the Arlington County (also subject to an NAACP lawsuit, and which had lost its elected school board pursuant to other parts of the Stanley Plan) and Norfolk schools desegregated peacefully. Soon, all counties reopened and integrated with the exception of Prince Edward County that took the extreme step of choosing not to appropriate any funding for its school system, thus forcing all its public schools to close, although Prince Edward County provided tuition grants for all students, regardless of their race, to use for private, nonsectarian education. Since no private schools existed for blacks within the county, black children in the county either had to leave the county to receive any education between 1959 and 1963, or received no education. All private schools in the region remained racially segregated. This lasted until 1964, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Prince Edward County&#x27;s decision to provide tuition grants for private schools that only admitted whites violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, in the case of &quot;Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County&quot;.

===North===
Many Northern cities also had de facto segregation policies, which resulted in a vast gulf in educational resources between black and white communities. In Harlem, New York, for example, not a single new school had been built since the turn of the century, nor did a single nursery school exist, even as the Second Great Migration caused overcrowding of existing schools. Existing schools tended to be dilapidated and staffed with inexperienced teachers. Northern officials were in denial of the segregation, but &quot;Brown&quot; helped stimulate activism among African-American parents like Mae Mallory who, with support of the NAACP, initiated a successful lawsuit against the city and State of New York on &quot;Brown&quot; principles. Mallory and thousands of other parents bolstered the pressure of the lawsuit with a school boycott in 1959. During the boycott, some of the first Freedom Schools of the period were established. The city responded to the campaign by permitting more open transfers to high-quality, historically white schools. (New York&#x27;s African-American community, and Northern desegregation activists generally, now found themselves contending with the problem of white flight, however.)

===Topeka===

The Topeka junior high schools had been integrated since 1941. Topeka High School was integrated from its inception in 1871 and its sports teams from 1949 onwards. The Kansas law permitting segregated schools allowed them only &quot;below the high school level&quot;.

Soon after the district court decision, election outcomes and the political climate in Topeka changed. The Board of Education of Topeka began to end segregation in the Topeka elementary schools in August 1953, integrating two attendance districts. All the Topeka elementary schools were changed to neighborhood attendance centers in January 1956, although existing students were allowed to continue attending their prior assigned schools at their option. Plaintiff Zelma Henderson, in a 2004 interview, recalled that no demonstrations or tumult accompanied desegregation in Topeka&#x27;s schools: &quot;They accepted it ... It wasn&#x27;t too long until they integrated the teachers and principals.&quot;

The Topeka Public Schools administration building is named in honor of McKinley Burnett, NAACP chapter president who organized the case.

Monroe Elementary was designated a National Historic Site under the National Park Service on October 26, 1992, and redesignated a National Historical Park on May 12, 2022.

The intellectual roots of &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, the landmark United States Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutionality of racial segregation in 1896 under the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal&quot; were, in part, tied to the scientific racism of the era. However, the popular support for the decision was more likely a result of the racist beliefs held by many whites at the time. In deciding &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, the Supreme Court rejected the ideas of scientific racists about the need for segregation, especially in schools. The court buttressed its holding by citing (in footnote 11) social science research about the harms to black children caused by segregated schools.

Both scholarly and popular ideas of hereditarianism played an important role in the attack and backlash that followed the &quot;Brown&quot; decision. &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot; was founded in 1960, in part in response to the &quot;Brown&quot; decision.

==Legal criticism and praise==

William Rehnquist wrote a memo titled &quot;A Random Thought on the Segregation Cases&quot; when he was a law clerk for Justice Robert H. Jackson in 1952, during early deliberations that led to the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision. In his memo, Rehnquist argued: &quot;I realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position, for which I have been excoriated by &#x27;liberal&#x27; colleagues but I think &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; was right and should be reaffirmed.&quot; Rehnquist continued, &quot;To the argument ... that a majority may not deprive a minority of its constitutional right, the answer must be made that while this is sound in theory, in the long run it is the majority who will determine what the constitutional rights of the minorities are.&quot; Rehnquist also argued for &quot;Plessy&quot; with other law clerks.

However, during his 1971 confirmation hearings, Rehnquist said, &quot;I believe that the memorandum was prepared by me as a statement of Justice Jackson&#x27;s tentative views for his own use.&quot; Jackson had initially planned to join a dissent in &quot;Brown&quot;. Later, at his 1986 hearings for the slot of Chief Justice, Rehnquist put further distance between himself and the 1952 memo: &quot;The bald statement that Plessy was right and should be reaffirmed, was not an accurate reflection of my own views at the time.&quot; In any event, while serving on the Supreme Court, Rehnquist made no effort to reverse or undermine the &quot;Brown&quot; decision, and frequently relied upon it as precedent.

Chief Justice Warren&#x27;s reasoning was broadly criticized by contemporary legal academics with Judge Learned Hand decrying that the Supreme Court had &quot;assumed the role of a third legislative chamber&quot; and Herbert Wechsler finding &quot;Brown&quot; impossible to justify based on neutral principles.

Some aspects of the &quot;Brown&quot; decision are still debated. Notably, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, himself an African American, wrote in &quot;Missouri v. Jenkins&quot; (1995) that at the very least, &quot;Brown I&quot; has been misunderstood by the courts.

Some Constitutional originalists, notably Raoul Berger in his influential 1977 book &quot;Government by Judiciary,&quot; make the case that &quot;Brown&quot; cannot be defended by reference to the original understanding of the 14th Amendment. They support this reading of the 14th Amendment by noting that the Civil Rights Act of 1875 did not ban segregated schools and that the same Congress that passed the 14th Amendment also voted to segregate schools in the District of Columbia. Other originalists, including Michael W. McConnell, a federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in his article &quot;Originalism and the Desegregation Decisions,&quot; argue that the Radical Reconstructionists who spearheaded the 14th Amendment were in favor of desegregated southern schools. Evidence supporting this interpretation of the 14th Amendment has come from archived Congressional records showing that proposals for federal legislation which would enforce school integration were debated in Congress a few years following the amendment&#x27;s ratification.

In response to Michael McConnell&#x27;s research, Raoul Berger argued that the Congressmen and Senators who were advocating in favor of school desegregation in the 1870s were trying to rewrite the 14th Amendment in order to make the 14th Amendment fit their political agenda and that the actual understanding of the 14th Amendment from 1866 to 1868 (which is when the 14th Amendment was actually passed and ratified) does, in fact, permit US states to have segregated schools. Berger criticized McConnell for being unable to find any reference to school segregation—let alone any reference to a desire to prohibit it—among supporters of the 14th Amendment in the congressional history of this amendment (specifically in the recordings of the 39th United States Congress, since that was the US Congress that actually passed the 14th Amendment) and also criticized McConnell&#x27;s view that the 1954 view of &quot;civil rights&quot; should be decisive in interpreting the 14th Amendment as opposed to the 1866 view of &quot;civil rights.&quot; Berger also argues that McConnell failed to provide any evidence that the state legislatures who ratified the 14th Amendment understood it at the time as prohibiting school segregation and that whenever the question of school segregation&#x27;s compatibility with the US Constitution (as opposed to the separate question of school segregation&#x27;s compatibility with US state law and/or US state constitutions, where courts have often ruled against school segregation) reached the judiciary in the couple of decades after the passage and ratification of the 14th Amendment (whether in Ohio, Nevada, California, Indiana, or New York), courts have always affirmed the constitutionality of school segregation—as did Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas M. Cooley in his 1880 treatise &quot;The General Principles of Constitutional Law in the United States of America&quot;. In addition, Berger argues that the views of the draftsmen of the 14th Amendment in 1866 are decisive—as opposed to the views of later readers of the 14th Amendment (including the views of supporters of the 14th Amendment after this amendment&#x27;s passage and ratification due to the fact that even their views and beliefs about the meaning and scope of this Amendment could and sometimes did change over time—like with Nevada U.S. Senator William Morris Stewart, who initially opposed school desegregation but later changed his mind and supported it). To back up his view about original intent being decisive, Berger cites—among other things—an 1871 quote by James A. Garfield to John Bingham where Garfield challenged Bingham&#x27;s recollection of a statement that Bingham had previously made in 1866—with Garfield telling Bingham that he can make but not unmake history.

The case also has attracted some criticism from more liberal authors, including some who say that Chief Justice Warren&#x27;s reliance on psychological criteria to find a harm against segregated blacks was unnecessary. For example, Drew S. Days III has written: &quot;we have developed criteria for evaluating the constitutionality of racial classifications that do not depend upon findings of psychic harm or social science evidence. They are based rather on the principle that &#x27;distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality,&#x27; &quot;Hirabayashi v. United States&quot;, 320 U.S. 81 (1943). . . .&quot;

In his book &quot;The Tempting of America&quot; (page 82), Robert Bork endorsed the &quot;Brown&quot; decision as follows:

In June 1987, Philip Elman, a civil rights attorney who served as an associate in the Solicitor General&#x27;s office during Harry Truman&#x27;s term, claimed he and Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter were mostly responsible for the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, and stated that the NAACP&#x27;s arguments did not present strong evidence. Elman has been criticized for offering a self-aggrandizing history of the case, omitting important facts, and denigrating the work of civil rights attorneys who had laid the groundwork for the decision over many decades. However, Frankfurter was also known for being one of court&#x27;s most outspoken advocates of the judicial restraint philosophy of basing court rulings on existing law rather than personal or political considerations. Public officials in the United States today are nearly unanimous in lauding the ruling. In May 2004, the fiftieth anniversary of the ruling, President George W. Bush spoke at the opening of the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; National Historic Site, calling &quot;Brown&quot; &quot;a decision that changed America for the better, and forever.&quot; Most Senators and Representatives issued press releases hailing the ruling.

In a 2016 article in Townhall.com, an outlet of the Salem Media Group, economist Thomas Sowell argued that when Chief Justice Earl Warren declared in the landmark 1954 case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that racially separate schools were &quot;inherently unequal,&quot; Dunbar High School was a living refutation of that assumption. And it was within walking distance of the Supreme Court.&quot; In Sowell&#x27;s estimation, &quot;Dunbar, which had been accepting outstanding black students from anywhere in the city, could now accept only students from the rough ghetto neighborhood in which it was located&quot; as a detrimental consequence of the SCOTUS decision.

==&quot;Brown II&quot;==
In 1955, the Supreme Court considered arguments by the schools requesting relief concerning the task of desegregation. In their decision, which became known as &quot;Brown II&quot; the court delegated the task of carrying out school desegregation to district courts with orders that desegregation occur &quot;with all deliberate speed,&quot; a phrase traceable to Francis Thompson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot;.

Supporters of the earlier decision were displeased with this decision. The language &quot;all deliberate speed&quot; was seen by critics as too ambiguous to ensure reasonable haste for compliance with the court&#x27;s instruction. Many Southern states and school districts interpreted &quot;Brown II&quot; as legal justification for resisting, delaying, and avoiding significant integration for years—and in some cases for a decade or more—using such tactics as closing down school systems, using state money to finance segregated &quot;private&quot; schools, and &quot;token&quot; integration where a few carefully selected black children were admitted to former white-only schools but the vast majority remained in underfunded, unequal black schools.

For example, based on &quot;Brown II&quot;, the U.S. District Court ruled that Prince Edward County, Virginia did not have to desegregate immediately. When faced with a court order to finally begin desegregation in 1959 the county board of supervisors stopped appropriating money for public schools, which remained closed for five years, from 1959 to 1964.

White students in the county were given assistance to attend white-only &quot;private academies&quot; that were taught by teachers formerly employed by the public school system, while black students had no education at all unless they moved out of the county. But the public schools reopened after the Supreme Court overturned &quot;Brown II&quot; in &quot;Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County&quot;, declaring that &quot;...the time for mere &#x27;deliberate speed&#x27; has run out&quot; and that the county must provide a public school system for all children regardless of race.

==&quot;Brown III&quot;==
In 1978, Topeka attorneys Richard Jones, Joseph Johnson and Charles Scott Jr. (son of the original &quot;Brown&quot; team member), with assistance from the American Civil Liberties Union, persuaded Linda Brown Smith—who now had her own children in Topeka schools—to be a plaintiff in reopening &quot;Brown&quot;. They were concerned that the Topeka Public Schools&#x27; policy of &quot;open enrollment&quot; had led to and would lead to further segregation. They also believed that with a choice of open enrollment, white parents would shift their children to &quot;preferred&quot; schools that would create both predominantly African-American and predominantly European-American schools within the district. The district court reopened the &quot;Brown&quot; case after a 25-year hiatus, but denied the plaintiffs&#x27; request finding the schools &quot;unitary&quot;. In 1989, a three-judge panel of the Tenth Circuit on a 2–1 vote found that the vestiges of segregation remained with respect to student and staff assignment. In 1993, the Supreme Court denied the appellant School District&#x27;s request for &quot;certiorari&quot; and returned the case to District Court Judge Richard Rodgers for implementation of the Tenth Circuit&#x27;s mandate.

After a 1994 plan was approved and a bond issue passed, additional elementary magnet schools were opened and district attendance plans redrawn, which resulted in the Topeka schools meeting court standards of racial balance by 1998. Unified status was eventually granted to Topeka Unified School District No. 501 on July 27, 1999. One of the new magnet schools is named after the Scott family attorneys for their role in the &quot;Brown&quot; case and civil rights.

== Other comments ==
A PBS film called &quot;Simple Justice&quot; retells the story of the &quot;Brown vs. Board of Education&quot; case, beginning with the work of the NAACP&#x27;s Legal Defense Fund&#x27;s efforts to combat &#x27;separate but equal&#x27; in graduate school education and culminating in the historical 1954 decision.

Linda Brown Thompson later recalled the experience of being refused enrollment:

Linda Brown died on March 25, 2018, at the age of 75.

<doc id="66414" wikidata="Q2247456" url="?curid=66414" title="Baconian method">
<text>The Baconian method is the investigative method developed by Francis Bacon, one of the founders of modern science, and thus a first formulation of a modern scientific method. The method was put forward in Bacon&#x27;s book &quot;Novum Organum&quot; (1620), or &#x27;New Method&#x27;, to replace the old methods put forward in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Organon&quot;. It influenced the early modern rejection of medieval Aristotelianism.

==Description in the &quot;Novum Organum&quot;==

===Bacon&#x27;s view of induction===
Bacon&#x27;s method is an example of the application of inductive reasoning. However, Bacon&#x27;s method of induction is much more complex than the essential inductive process of making generalisations from observations. Bacon&#x27;s method begins with description of the requirements for making the careful, systematic observations necessary to produce quality facts. He then proceeds to use induction, the ability to generalise from a set of facts to one or more axioms. However, he stresses the necessity of not generalising beyond what the facts truly demonstrate. The next step may be to gather additional data, or the researcher may use existing data and the new axioms to establish additional axioms. Specific types of facts can be particularly useful, such as negative instances, exceptional instances and data from experiments. The whole process is repeated in a stepwise fashion to build an increasingly complex base of knowledge, but one which is always supported by observed facts, or more generally speaking, empirical data.

He argues in the &quot;Novum Organum&quot; that our only hope for building true knowledge is through this careful method. Old knowledge-building methods were often not based in facts, but on broad, ill-proven deductions and metaphysical conjecture. Even when theories were based in fact, they were often broad generalisations and/or abstractions from few instances of casually gathered observations. Using Bacon&#x27;s process, man could start fresh, setting aside old superstitions, over-generalisations, and traditional (often unproven) &quot;facts&quot;. Researchers could slowly but accurately build an essential base of knowledge from the ground up. Describing then-existing knowledge, Bacon claims:

There is the same degree of licentiousness and error in forming axioms as [there is] in abstracting notions, and [also] in the first principles, which depend in common induction [versus Bacon&#x27;s induction]; still more is this the case in axioms and inferior propositions derived from syllogisms.

While he advocated a very empirical, observational, reasoned method that did away with metaphysical conjecture, Bacon was a religious man, believed in God, and believed his work had a religious role. He contended, like other researchers at the time, that by doing this careful work man could begin to understand God&#x27;s wonderful creation, to reclaim the knowledge that had been lost in Adam and Eve&#x27;s &quot;fall&quot;, and to make the most of his God-given talents.

=== Role of the English Reformation ===
There is a wider array of seminal works about the interaction of Puritanism and early science. Among others, Dorothy Stimson, Richard Foster Jones, and Robert Merton saw Puritanism as a major driver of the reforms initiated by Bacon and the development of science overall. Steven Matthews is cautious about the interaction with a single confession, as the English Reformation allowed a higher doctrinal diversity compared to the continent. However, Matthews is quite outspoken that &quot;Bacon&#x27;s entire understanding of what we call &#x27;science,&#x27; and what he called &#x27;natural philosophy,&#x27; was fashioned around the basic tenets of his belief system.&quot;

===Approach to causality===
The method consists of procedures for isolating and further investigating the &quot;form nature&quot;, or cause, of a phenomenon, including the method of agreement, method of difference, and method of concomitant variation.

Bacon suggests that you draw up a list of all things in which the phenomenon you are trying to explain occurs, as well as a list of things in which it does not occur. Then you rank your lists according to the degree in which the phenomenon occurs in each one. Then you should be able to deduce what factors match the occurrence of the phenomenon in one list and don&#x27;t occur in the other list, and also what factors change in accordance with the way the data had been ranked.

Thus, if an army is successful when commanded by Essex, and not successful when not commanded by Essex: and when it is more or less successful according to the degree of involvement of Essex as its commander, then it is scientifically reasonable to say that being commanded by Essex is causally related to the army&#x27;s success.

From this Bacon suggests that the underlying cause of the phenomenon, what he calls the &quot;form&quot;, can be approximated by interpreting the results of one&#x27;s observations. This approximation Bacon calls the &quot;First Vintage&quot;. It is not a final conclusion about the formal cause of the phenomenon but merely a hypothesis. It is only the first stage in the attempt to find the form and it must be scrutinised and compared to other hypotheses. In this manner, the truth of natural philosophy is approached &quot;by gradual degrees&quot;, as stated in his &quot;Novum Organum&quot;.

===Refinements===
The &quot;Baconian method&quot; does not end at the First Vintage. Bacon described numerous classes of &quot;Instances with Special Powers,&quot; cases in which the phenomenon one is attempting to explain is particularly relevant. These instances, of which Bacon describes 27 in the &quot;Novum Organum&quot;, aid and accelerate the process of induction.

Aside from the First Vintage and the Instances with Special Powers, Bacon enumerates additional &quot;aids to the intellect&quot; which presumably are the next steps in his method. These additional aids, however, were never explained beyond their initial limited appearance in &quot;Novum Organum&quot;.

==Natural history==
The &quot;Natural History&quot; of Pliny the Elder was a classical Roman encyclopedia work. Induction, for Bacon&#x27;s followers, meant a type of rigour applied to factual matters. Reasoning should not be applied in plain fashion to just any collection of examples, an approach identified as &quot;Plinian&quot;. In considering natural facts, a fuller survey was required to form a basis for going further. Bacon made it clear he was looking for more than &quot;a botany&quot; with discursive accretions.

In concrete terms, the cabinet of curiosities, exemplifying the Plinian approach, was to be upgraded from a source of wonderment to a challenge to science. The main source in Bacon&#x27;s works for the approach was his &quot;Sylva Sylvarum&quot;, and it suggested a more systematic collection of data in the search for causal explanations.

Underlying the method, as applied in this context, are therefore the &quot;tables of natural history&quot; and the ways in which they are to be constructed. Bacon&#x27;s background in the common law has been proposed as a source for this concept of investigation.

As a general intellectual programme, Bacon&#x27;s ideas on &quot;natural history&quot; have been seen as a broad influence on British writers later in the 17th century, in particular in economic thought and within the Royal Society.

==Idols of the mind (&quot;idola mentis&quot;)==

Bacon also listed what he called the idols (false images) of the mind. He described these as things which obstructed the path of correct scientific reasoning.
#Idols of the Tribe (&quot;Idola tribus&quot;): This is humans&#x27; tendency to perceive more order and regularity in systems than truly exists, and is due to people following their preconceived ideas about things.
#Idols of the Cave (&quot;Idola specus&quot;): This is due to individuals&#x27; personal weaknesses in reasoning due to particular personalities, likes and dislikes.
#Idols of the Marketplace (&quot;Idola fori&quot;): This is due to confusion in the use of language and taking some words in science to have a different meaning than their common usage.
#Idols of the Theatre (&quot;Idola theatri&quot;): This is the following of academic dogma and not asking questions about the world.

==Influence==
The physician Thomas Browne (1605–1682) was one of the first scientists to adhere to the empiricism of the Baconian method. His encyclopaedia &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot; (1st edition 1646 – 5th edition 1672) includes numerous examples of Baconian investigative methodology, while its preface echoes lines from Bacon&#x27;s &quot;On Truth&quot; from &quot;The Advancement of Learning&quot; (1605). Isaac Newton&#x27;s saying &quot;hypotheses non fingo&quot; (I don&#x27;t frame hypotheses) occurs in later editions of the &quot;Principia&quot;. It represents his preference for rules that could be demonstrated, as opposed to unevidenced hypotheses.

The Baconian method was further developed and promoted by John Stuart Mill. His 1843 book, &quot;A System of Logic&quot;, was an effort to shed further light on issues of causation. In this work, he formulated the five principles of inductive reasoning now known as Mill&#x27;s methods.

== Frankfurt School critique of Baconian method ==

Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno observe that Bacon shuns &quot;knowledge that tendeth but to satisfaction&quot; in favor of effective procedures. While the Baconian method disparages idols of the mind, its requirement for effective procedures compels it to adopt a credulous, submissive stance toward worldly power. 

:: Power confronts the individual as the universal, as the reason which informs reality.

::Knowledge, which is power, knows no limits, either in its enslavement of creation or in its deference to worldly masters.
Horkheimer and Adorno offer a plea to recover the virtues of the &quot;metaphysical apologia&quot;, which is able to reveal the injustice of effective procedures rather than merely employing them.

::The metaphysical apologia at least betrayed the injustice of the established order through the incongruence of concept and reality. The impartiality of scientific language deprived what was powerless of the strength to make itself heard and merely provided the existing order with a neutral sign for itself. Such neutrality is more metaphysical than metaphysics.

<doc id="66417" wikidata="Q600" url="?curid=66417" title="Ichiro Suzuki">
<text>, also known mononymously as , is a Japanese former professional baseball outfielder who played for 28 seasons. He played the first nine years of his career with the Orix BlueWave of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), and the next 12 years with the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB). Suzuki then played two and a half seasons with the New York Yankees and three with the Miami Marlins before returning to the Mariners for his final two seasons. He won two World Baseball Classic titles as part of the Japanese national team. He also became the Mariners&#x27; special assistant to the chairman in 2019. He is regarded as one of the greatest contact hitters, leadoff hitters and defensive outfielders in baseball history.

In his combined playing time in the NPB and MLB, Suzuki received 17 consecutive selections as an All-Star and Gold Glove winner, won nine league batting titles, and was named his league&#x27;s most valuable player (MVP) four times. In the NPB, he won seven consecutive batting titles and three consecutive Pacific League MVP Awards. In 2001, Suzuki became the first Japanese-born position player to be posted and signed to an MLB club. He led the American League (AL) in batting average and stolen bases en route to being named AL Rookie of the Year and AL MVP.

Suzuki was the first MLB player to enter the Meikyukai (The Golden Players Club). He was a ten-time MLB All-Star and won the 2007 All-Star Game MVP Award for a three-hit performance that included the event&#x27;s first-ever inside-the-park home run. Suzuki won a Rawlings Gold Glove Award in each of his first 10 years in the majors and had an American League–record seven hitting streaks of 20 or more games, with a high of 27. He was also noted for the longevity of his career, continuing to produce at a high level with slugging, and on-base percentages above .300 in 2016, while approaching 43 years of age. Suzuki also set a number of batting records, including MLB&#x27;s single-season record for hits with 262. He achieved 10 consecutive 200-hit seasons, the longest streak by any player in history. In 2016, Suzuki notched the 3,000th hit of his MLB career, becoming only the 30th player ever to do so. In total, he finished with 4,367 hits in his professional career across Japan and the United States, the most of any player in history at the top level of baseball. In , Suzuki was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He became the first Japanese player to be elected into the Hall of Fame, receiving 99.7% of the vote, tied with Derek Jeter for the second-highest total ever. That same year, Suzuki was also elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Suzuki grew up in Toyoyama, a small town just outside Nagoya. At the age of seven, Suzuki joined his first baseball team and asked his father, Nobuyuki Suzuki (鈴木宣之), to teach him to be a better player. The two began a daily routine, which included throwing 50 pitches, fielding 50 infield balls and 50 outfield balls, and hitting 500 pitches, 250 from a pitching machine and 250 from his father.

As a little leaguer in Toyoyama, Suzuki had the word written on his glove. By age 12, he had dedicated himself to pursuing a career in professional baseball, and their training sessions were no longer for leisure, and less enjoyable. The elder Suzuki claimed, &quot;Baseball was fun for both of us,&quot; but Ichiro later said, &quot;It might have been fun for him, but for me it was a lot like &quot;Star of the Giants,&quot;&quot; a popular Japanese manga and anime series about a young baseball prospect&#x27;s difficult road to success, with rigorous training demanded by the father. According to Ichiro, &quot;It bordered on hazing and I suffered a lot.&quot;

When Suzuki joined his high-school baseball team, his father told the coach, &quot;No matter how good Ichiro is, don&#x27;t ever praise him. We have to make him spiritually strong.&quot; When he was ready to enter high school, Suzuki was selected by a school with a prestigious baseball program, Nagoya&#x27;s &quot;Aikodai Meiden&quot; (:ja:愛工大名電) High School. Suzuki was primarily used as a pitcher instead of as an outfielder, owing to his exceptionally strong arm. His cumulative high-school batting average was .505, with 19 home runs. He had known Hideki Matsui (then at Seiryo High School, Ishikawa - :ja:星稜高校, one grade below him) through practice matches since that time.

He built strength and stamina by hurling car tires and hitting Wiffle balls with a heavy shovel, among other regimens. These exercises helped develop his wrists and hips, adding power and endurance to his thin frame. Despite his outstanding numbers in high school, Suzuki was not drafted until the fourth round of the NPB draft in November 1991, because many teams were discouraged by his small size of and . Years later, Suzuki told an interviewer, &quot;I&#x27;m not a big guy, and hopefully kids could look at me and see that I&#x27;m not muscular and not physically imposing, that I&#x27;m just a regular guy. So if somebody with a regular body can get into the record books, kids can look at that. That would make me happy.&quot;

==Professional career==
===Orix BlueWave (1992–2000)===
Suzuki made his NPB Pacific League debut in 1992 for the Orix BlueWave at the age of 18, but he spent most of his first two seasons in the farm system (accumulating 156 minor league hits and a .368 batting average) because his then-manager, Shōzō Doi, refused to accept Suzuki&#x27;s unorthodox swing. The swing was nicknamed because of the pendulum-like motion of his leg, which shifts his weight forward as he swings the bat, and goes against conventional hitting theory. In his second career game, he recorded his first &quot;ichi-gun&quot; (Japan&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball League) hit in the Pacific League against Fukuoka Daiei Hawks pitcher Keiji Kimura. Despite hitting a home run in 1993 against Hideo Nomo, who later won the National League Rookie of the Year Award, Suzuki was nevertheless sent back to the farm system on that very day. In 1994, he benefited from the arrival of a new manager, Akira Ōgi, who played him every day in the second spot of the lineup. He was eventually moved to the leadoff spot, where his immediate productivity dissolved any misgivings about his unconventional swing. He set a Japanese single-season record with 210 hits, the first player ever to top 200 hits in a single season. Five other players have since done so: Matt Murton, Norichika Aoki (twice), Alex Ramírez, Tsuyoshi Nishioka, and Shogo Akiyama.

Suzuki&#x27;s .385 batting average in 1994 was a Pacific League record and won the young outfielder the first of a record seven consecutive batting titles. Suzuki also hit 13 home runs and had 29 stolen bases, helping him to earn his first of three straight Pacific League MVP (Most Valuable Player) awards. It was during the 1994 season that he began to use his given name, &quot;Ichiro,&quot; instead of his family name, &quot;Suzuki,&quot; on the back of his uniform. Suzuki is the second-most-common family name in Japan, and his manager introduced the idea as a publicity move to help create a new image for what had been a relatively weak team, as well as a way to distinguish their rising star. Initially, Suzuki disliked the practice and was embarrassed by it; however, &quot;Ichiro&quot; was a household name by the end of the season, and he was flooded with endorsement offers.

In 1995, Suzuki led the Blue Wave to its first Pacific League pennant in 12 years. In addition to his second batting title, he led the league with 80 RBI and 49 stolen bases, while his career-high 25 home runs were third in the league. By this time, the Japanese press had begun calling him the . The following year, with Suzuki winning his third-straight MVP award, the team defeated the Central League champion, Yomiuri Giants, in the Japan Series. Following the 1996 season, playing in an exhibition series against a visiting team of Major League All-Stars kindled Suzuki&#x27;s desire to travel to the United States to play in the Major Leagues.

In November 1998, Suzuki participated in a seven-game exhibition series between Japanese and American all-stars. Suzuki batted .380 and collected seven stolen bases in the series, winning praise from several of his MLB counterparts, including Sammy Sosa and Jamie Moyer, who would become his teammate with the Mariners.

In 2000, Suzuki was still a year away from being eligible for free agency, but the Blue Wave was no longer among Japan&#x27;s best teams. Because the team would probably not be able to afford to keep him and would lose him without compensation in another year, Orix allowed him to negotiate with Major League clubs. Suzuki used the posting system, and the Seattle Mariners won the right to negotiate with him with a bid of approximately $13 million. In November, Suzuki signed a three-year, $14 million contract with the Seattle Mariners. In his nine NPB seasons in Japan, Suzuki had 1,278 hits, a .353 career batting average, and won seven Golden Glove Awards. Suzuki&#x27;s time in the Japanese baseball leagues matured him as a player and a person, and he often credits it for his success.

===Seattle Mariners (2001–2012)===
====2001: Rookie of the Year and AL MVP====

Due to an agreement between Japanese baseball and the MLB, Suzuki was not allowed to play in the United States before 2001. His move to the United States was viewed with some interest because he was among the first Japanese position players to play for an MLB team. In the same way that many Japanese teams had considered the 18-year-old Suzuki too small to draft in 1992, many Americans believed he would prove too frail to succeed against Major League pitching or endure the longer 162-game season. Suzuki made an auspicious debut with Seattle, and in the Mariners&#x27; eighth game revealed his tremendous throwing arm by gunning down Oakland&#x27;s Terrence Long, who had tried to advance from first to third on a teammate&#x27;s single to right field. That play would be dubbed &quot;The Throw&quot; by Japanese media covering Suzuki&#x27;s progress.

After expressing no preference as to a uniform number, Suzuki was issued #51 by the Mariners, which was his number when he played in Japan. He was initially hesitant because it had previously been worn by pitching star Randy Johnson. To avoid insulting Johnson, Suzuki sent a personal message to the pitcher promising not to &quot;bring shame&quot; to the uniform. His trepidation was unfounded, as he had a remarkable 2001 season, accumulating a rookie-record 242 hits, breaking Lloyd Waner’s rookie record of 223 hits dating back to 1927, and the most hits by any MLB player since 1930. His perennial Gold Glove fielding led Safeco&#x27;s right field to be dubbed &quot;Area 51&quot;. With a .350 batting average and 56 stolen bases, Suzuki was the first player to lead his league in both categories since Jackie Robinson in 1949. The season included hitting streaks of 25 and 23 games, an appearance on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, and intense media attention on both sides of the Pacific. Fans from Japan were taking $2,000 baseball tours, sometimes flying in and out of the U.S. just to watch Suzuki&#x27;s games. More than 150 Japanese reporters and photographers were given media access. Safeco Field&#x27;s sushi stands began selling &quot;Ichirolls&quot;, a spicy tuna roll served with wasabi and ginger.

Aided by Major League Baseball&#x27;s decision to allow All-Star voting in Japan, Suzuki was the first rookie to lead all players in voting for the All-Star Game. That winter, he won the American League Most Valuable Player and the Rookie of the Year awards, becoming only the second player in MLB history (after Fred Lynn) to receive both honors in the same season. Suzuki is also the only player in MLB history to win an MVP, Rookie of the Year, Gold Glove Award, and Silver Slugger Award and start in the All-Star Game in the same season.

2001 had been an exceptionally successful regular season for the Mariners, as they matched the 1906 Chicago Cubs&#x27; Major League record of 116 wins. In his only postseason appearance with the Mariners, Suzuki continued his hot hitting, batting .600 in the ALDS against the Cleveland Indians. However, on Suzuki&#x27;s 28th birthday, Seattle&#x27;s stellar season ended against the New York Yankees in the ALCS, as Suzuki was held to a .222 average during the series. Yankees manager Joe Torre had emphasized to his pitchers, &quot;Do not let Ichiro beat you. He is the key to Seattle&#x27;s offense.&quot; Informed of this assessment, Suzuki said, &quot;If that is true, it would give me great joy. I don&#x27;t believe he is right.&quot;

====2002====

Suzuki finished his second year in American baseball with 208 total hits, making him the first Mariners player ever with two consecutive seasons of at least 200 hits. He was the fifth player in MLB history to start a career with two 200-hit seasons. He got off to a hot start, but a late-season slump drove his batting average down to .321, 29 points below his batting average as a rookie. Suzuki finished the season second in the AL in hits, fourth in batting average, and fourth in steals. Suzuki led All-Star balloting for the second straight year. Although the Mariners had a 93–69 record, that was good for only a third-place finish in the competitive AL West.

====2003====
In 2003, Suzuki became just the third player in history to begin his career with three 200-hit seasons, by garnering 212. He again finished in the top 10 in the AL in hits, batting average, steals, and runs. Again, a late-season slump brought his average down by 42 points from mid-July to .312. Suzuki was elected to his third All-Star game, and he was again the vote leader in both leagues. However, the second-place Mariners again fell short of the playoffs. Following the season, Suzuki signed a 4-year, $44 million contract that kept him with the Mariners through 2007.

====2004: Single season hit record====
 Suzuki had his best offensive season in 2004, highlighted by his breaking of George Sisler&#x27;s 84-year-old record for most hits (257) in a season. An increase in games played benefited Suzuki, as he accumulated only 251 hits through the first 154 games of the season. Suzuki recorded 50 hits in four different months of the year (September and October are combined by MLB for this computational purpose), becoming the first player ever to have four in a season. With 51 hits in August 2001, Suzuki joined Pete Rose as the only players with four 50-hit months in a career.

On 21 May, Suzuki recorded his 2,000th professional hit. His 200th hit of 2004 came in just his 126th game. By the end of September, with one three-game series remaining, Suzuki&#x27;s hit total stood at 256—one shy of Sisler. Suzuki singled off the Rangers&#x27; Ryan Drese on 1 October to tie Sisler&#x27;s record. In the third inning, on a 3–2 count, Suzuki singled up the middle for his 258th hit of the year, which Suzuki later called &quot;the greatest moment of my baseball career&quot;. He was greeted by a swarm of teammates, and a standing ovation from the fans. Sisler&#x27;s daughter, Frances Sisler Drochelman attended the game and was greeted by Suzuki after his hit. Suzuki finished the 2004 season with a record of 262 hits, giving him the single-season records for both the United States and Japanese baseball.

In July 2009, while in St. Louis for his ninth All-Star appearance, Suzuki made a trip to Sisler&#x27;s grave. He later told reporters, &quot;There&#x27;s not many chances to come to St. Louis. In 2004, it was the first time I crossed paths with him, and his family generously came all the way to Seattle. Above all, it was a chance. I wanted to do that for a grand upperclassman of the baseball world. I think it&#x27;s only natural for someone to want to do that, to express my feelings in that way. I&#x27;m not sure if he&#x27;s happy about it.&quot;

From 2001 to 2004, Suzuki had more hits (924) than anyone in history over any four-year period, breaking the record of 918 that Bill Terry accumulated from 1929 to 1932; Terry, however, played in 34 fewer games than Suzuki during their respective four-year spans. He would later surpass his own mark by recording 930 hits from 2004 to 2007. During one 56-game stretch in 2004, Suzuki batted over .450. By comparison, Joe DiMaggio batted .408 during his record-setting 56-game hitting streak. Suzuki batted over .400 against left-handed pitching in 2004.

====2005====
During the off-season, then-manager Bob Melvin&#x27;s contract was not extended and the Mariners brought in Mike Hargrove as the new manager with a contract through 2007. It was Hargrove who had predicted that Suzuki would be no better than &quot;a fourth outfielder on [an American] major league team&quot; back when Suzuki was still in Japan. Speculation started that Hargrove and Suzuki did not get along very well in the season.

In 2005, Suzuki had his second worst year in his MLB career to date, collecting only 206 hits (the lowest total of his career to that point). However, he reached the plateau of a .300 batting average, 100+ runs, 30+ steals, and 200+ hits for the fifth straight season. That allowed Suzuki to become the first player to collect 200 hits per season in each of his first five years in the Major Leagues. Only Willie Keeler, Wade Boggs, Chuck Klein, Al Simmons, and Charlie Gehringer had had five consecutive 200-hit seasons at any point in their careers. During the season, he accumulated 1,000 career hits, reaching the career milestone faster than any other player in MLB history. Suzuki hit a career-high 15 home runs. In the off-season, Suzuki played himself in &quot;Furuhata Ninzaburō&quot;, a Japanese &quot;Columbo&quot;-like TV drama that he loves. In the drama, he kills a person and is arrested.

====2006====

Suzuki&#x27;s 2006 season got off to a disappointing start, with the outfielder hitting as low as .177 in the season&#x27;s third week. He quickly rebounded, finishing the season with a .322 average (sixth in the AL and 11th in the majors). Suzuki&#x27;s 224 hits led the majors, and he recorded 110 runs and 45 stolen bases. Suzuki was caught stealing only twice in 2006 for a 96% success rate. His 1,354 career U.S. hits topped Wade Boggs&#x27;s record for the most hits in any six-year period. In his sixth year in the majors, Suzuki collected his sixth Gold Glove Award, and a sixth All-Star Game selection. He also won a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding MLB right fielder.

Suzuki began wearing high stocking baseball pants in the 2006 World Baseball Classic.

====2007====

In May and June, Suzuki hit in 25 consecutive games, breaking the previous Seattle Mariners record set by Joey Cora in 1997. Suzuki broke Tim Raines&#x27; American League record by stealing 41 consecutive bases without being caught. Suzuki extended the record to 45; the major league record of 50 belongs to Vince Coleman.

On 10 July 2007, he became the first player to hit an inside-the-park home run in any MLB All-Star Game after an unpredictable hop off the right field wall of AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco. It was the first inside-the-park home run of Suzuki&#x27;s professional career. Suzuki was a perfect 3-for-3 in the game and was named the Most Valuable Player in the American League&#x27;s 5–4 victory.

2007 marked the end of Suzuki&#x27;s second contract with the Mariners, and he initially told MLB.com that he would likely enter the free agent market, citing the team&#x27;s lack of success in recent years. However, Suzuki signed a five-year contract extension with Seattle in July. The deal was reported to be worth $90 million, consisting of a $17 million annual salary and $5 million signing bonus. The Associated Press reported that Suzuki&#x27;s contract extension defers $25 million of the $90 million at 5.5% interest until after his retirement, with payments through 2032. Other provisions in Suzuki&#x27;s contract included a yearly housing allowance of more than $30,000, and four first-class round-trip tickets to Japan each year for his family. He was provided with either a new Jeep or Mercedes SUV, as well as a personal trainer and interpreter.

On 29 July 2007, Suzuki collected his 1,500th U.S. hit, the third fastest to reach the MLB milestone behind Al Simmons and George Sisler. 

====2008====
Suzuki had 213 hits in 2008, his eighth straight 200-hit season. This tied the 107-year-old record set by Wee Willie Keeler. Typically, Suzuki was among baseball&#x27;s leaders in reaching base on an error (14 times in 2008, more than any other batter in the AL), and in infield hits (his 56 were the most in the majors). Suzuki amassed an estimated 694 infield hits in his U.S. career. Detroit third baseman Brandon Inge told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I wish you could put a camera at third base to see how he hits the ball and see the way it deceives you. You can call some guys&#x27; infield hits cheap, but not his. He has amazing technique.&quot; In May 2008, Suzuki stole two bases, giving him a career total of 292, surpassing the previous Seattle Mariners team record of 290 set by second baseman Julio Cruz. Cruz, who worked on Spanish-language broadcasts of Mariners games at the time, was watching from the broadcast booth as Suzuki broke his record.

On 29 July 2008, Suzuki became the second-youngest player to amass 3,000 top-level professional hits (1,278 in Japan + 1,722 in the U.S.) after Ty Cobb. He also became just the second Japanese professional to get 3,000 hits. (Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s record holder is Isao Harimoto, with 3,085 hits).

By 2008, it had emerged in the media that Suzuki was known within baseball for his tradition of exhorting the American League team with a profanity-laced pregame speech in the clubhouse prior to the MLB All-Star Game. Asked if the speech had had any effect on the AL&#x27;s decade-long winning streak, Suzuki deadpanned, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to say over 90 percent.&quot; Minnesota first baseman Justin Morneau describes the effect: &quot;If you&#x27;ve never seen it, it&#x27;s definitely something pretty funny. It&#x27;s hard to explain, the effect it has on everyone. It&#x27;s such a tense environment. Everyone&#x27;s a little nervous for the game, and then he comes out. He doesn&#x27;t say a whole lot the whole time he&#x27;s in there, and all of a sudden, the manager gets done with his speech, and he pops off.&quot; Boston&#x27;s slugger David Ortiz says simply, &quot;It&#x27;s why we win.&quot;

====2009====

Suzuki began his 2009 season by going on the disabled list for the first time in his career. He had a bleeding ulcer, which team doctor Mitch Storey said may have been caused in part by the stress of playing in the World Baseball Classic. After missing 8 games, Suzuki debuted on 15 April and went 2-for-5 against the Angels, including a grand slam for his 3,085th overall professional career hit. The home run matched Isao Harimoto&#x27;s Japanese record for career hits, and Harimoto had been flown out to Seattle to witness the event. Suzuki surpassed the record the following night.
Suzuki was named #30 on the &quot;Sporting News&quot;&#x27; 2009 list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, voted upon by a 100-person panel of experts and former stars. In May and June, Suzuki surpassed his own franchise record with a 27-game hitting streak. Suzuki went on to record 44 hits in June 2009, his 20th career month with 40 or more hits. The previous players to have accomplished this were Stan Musial in the NL and Lou Gehrig in the AL.

On 6 September against the Oakland A&#x27;s, Suzuki collected his 2,000th MLB hit on the second pitch of the game, a double along the first base foul line. He is the second-fastest player to reach the milestone, behind Al Simmons. On 13 September against the Texas Rangers, Suzuki collected his 200th hit of the season for the ninth consecutive year, setting an all-time major league record. Suzuki recorded 210 hits with Orix in 1994, thereby giving him a total of ten 200 hit seasons in his professional career.

With two outs in the bottom of the 9th inning on 18 September, Suzuki hit a walk-off, two-run home run against Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, scoring Michael Saunders in one of the more memorable victories of the season. His homer made a winner out of Félix Hernández, who was in line for the loss despite having allowed only one run in 9 innings pitched.

On 26 September 2009, Suzuki was ejected from a game for the first time in his professional career. Arguing that a strikeout pitch from Toronto&#x27;s David Purcey had been outside, Suzuki used his bat to draw a line on the outer edge of the plate, and was immediately tossed by umpire Brian Runge. He was the only Mariner to be ejected from a game all season. The ejection may have hurt Suzuki&#x27;s chances regarding an esoteric record: the longest playing streak without going hitless in consecutive games. Suzuki&#x27;s stretch was at 180 games, the longest in the majors since Doc Cramer went 191 consecutive games without back-to-back 0-fers in 1934–35. Suzuki went hitless in the following afternoon&#x27;s game.

Suzuki again led the majors in hits in 2009, with 225. In spite of hitting ground balls at a rate of 55 percent, he grounded into only one double play all season; in the 15 April game, his first game played in 2009. He won his second Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding right fielder in MLB.

====2010====

Suzuki&#x27;s 37 career leadoff home runs rank 12th all time. Nevertheless, in 2009, Suzuki told &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

Chicks who dig home runs aren&#x27;t the ones who appeal to me. I think there&#x27;s sexiness in infield hits because they require technique. I&#x27;d rather impress the chicks with my technique than with my brute strength. Then, every now and then, just to show I can do that, too, I might flirt a little by hitting one out.

After playing in the season opener against the Oakland Athletics, Suzuki became eligible for Hall of Fame consideration, by playing in his tenth MLB season. On 5 June 2010, Suzuki scored his 1,000th career MLB run against the Angels on Franklin Gutierrez&#x27;s RBI groundout. On 1 September 2010, Suzuki also collected his 2,200th hit, a leadoff infield single against Cleveland Indians pitcher Josh Tomlin.

During the August 2010 series against the New York Yankees, Suzuki traveled to the Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York, to pay his respects at the grave of Hall-of-Famer &quot;Wee Willie&quot; Keeler, whose record for single-season hits he had broken in 2004.

On 23 September, Suzuki hit a single to center field against Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Shawn Hill to become the first MLB player in history to reach the 200 hit mark for 10 consecutive seasons. This feat also tied him with Pete Rose for the most career seasons of 200+ hits, and he surpassed Ty Cobb for most career seasons of 200+ hits in the AL. He finished the season with 214 hits, topping the MLB in that category. Suzuki also finished the season &quot;ironman&quot; style, playing in all 162 games. Only Suzuki and Matt Kemp did so for the 2010 season. This was Suzuki&#x27;s 3rd season playing in all 162 games. Also, Suzuki was nominated for the This Year in Baseball Award. Suzuki finished first or second in hits in all of his first 10 MLB seasons.

Suzuki won his tenth consecutive Rawlings Gold Glove Award in 2010, tying Ken Griffey Jr., Andruw Jones, and Al Kaline, and trailing only Roberto Clemente and Willie Mays (twelve each) for major league outfielders. Suzuki also won his second consecutive and third overall Fielding Bible Award for his statistically based defensive excellence in right field. Suzuki was the first right fielder in MLB history to win multiple Bible awards.

====2011====

On 2 April 2011, Suzuki broke the Mariners&#x27; all-time career hits record with his 2,248th hit in the 9th inning versus the Oakland Athletics, overtaking the team&#x27;s previous leader Edgar Martínez. 2011 marked the first time in Suzuki&#x27;s 11 seasons that he failed to make the All-Star team. He batted under .300 (.277) before the All-Star break for the first time in his career. On 10 July, manager Eric Wedge did not start Suzuki, ending his then-major league-best active streak of 255 consecutive starts. Suzuki followed with an 11-game hitting streak, but Wedge noted &quot;it&#x27;s not that easy to give that guy a day off&quot; due to Suzuki&#x27;s iconic stature. On 22 August, Suzuki hit his 35th career leadoff homer, tying him for 6th place with Bobby Bonds. Suzuki finished the season batting a career-low .272 with 184 hits, the first time in his 11-year MLB career he did not record 200 hits. It was also his first season not playing in the All-Star game, as well as his first season not winning a Gold Glove.

====2012====

On 19 June 2012, Suzuki led off a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks with a single to center field, the 2,500th hit of his MLB career. Suzuki reached the milestone in the fourth-fewest games in major league history, after Al Simmons, Ty Cobb, and George Sisler. In a 13-inning road loss to the Oakland A&#x27;s on 8 July, Suzuki was placed second in the batting order and responded by going 2 for 6 to bring his season batting average to .261 heading into the All-Star break. In the previous night&#x27;s game, Suzuki recorded two hits to break a career-worst 0-for-23 hitless streak. Suzuki had also been tried at the three-spot in the batting order during a season for which he earned $18 million. Former teammate Jay Buhner stated he felt Suzuki was the recipient of too much blame for the Mariners&#x27; difficulties but &quot;at the same time, they need help desperately.&quot; Buhner stated that if Suzuki were awarded a three-year contract extension for somewhere between $35 million and $40 million, &quot;I&#x27;d vomit. I mean, really, no offense. No offense, we&#x27;ve got to get this organization turned around. You can&#x27;t be spending all the money on one guy.&quot;

With a contract extension with the Mariners unknown, Suzuki stated, &quot;It&#x27;s going to go both ways. It can&#x27;t just come from the player. It&#x27;s got to come from the team, too. If the team is saying they need you, you&#x27;re necessary, then it becomes a piece. But if it&#x27;s just coming from the player, it&#x27;s not going to happen.&quot; Suzuki&#x27;s agent, Tony Attanasio, said, &quot;He knows that the club has to grow. He knows they have to play the younger guys and get them more playing time. The only way he knows to do that is to move on. He doesn&#x27;t want to stop playing. He wants to continue.&quot;

===New York Yankees (2012–2014)===
====Rest of 2012: second postseason appearance====
Suzuki approached the Mariners to ask for a trade at midseason in 2012. His first choice was to play for the New York Yankees. The Mariners traded him to the Yankees for minor league pitchers D. J. Mitchell and Danny Farquhar on 23 July. Seattle also received cash in the trade. Suzuki left Seattle hitting .261 with a .288 on-base percentage (OBP), four home runs, 28 RBIs and 15 stolen bases in 95 games. His first game as a Yankee was played the night of the trade, at Safeco Field against the Mariners. Before the trade was consummated, Suzuki agreed to the Yankees&#x27; conditions, which stated that they would play Suzuki primarily in left field, bat him at the bottom of the lineup, and occasionally sit him against left-handed pitching. Suzuki hit safely in his first 12 games as a Yankee, tying a record set by Don Slaught. He wore number 31 during his tenure with the Yankees, as his traditional 51 had not been used since the 2006 retirement of Bernie Williams, who wore it while playing for the Yankees.

Suzuki hit his first home run as a Yankee, and the 100th of his career, on 30 July against the Baltimore Orioles. For the week ending 23 September, Suzuki was named AL Player of the Week after hitting .600 (15-for-25) with three doubles, two home runs, five RBI, seven runs scored, and six stolen bases in six games. He led all MLB players in batting average, hits, steals and OBP (.630). In 67 games with New York, Suzuki batted .322 with a .340 OBP, 28 runs, five home runs and 27 RBIs. With his improved performance, the Yankees at times batted him second and also started him against left-handers.

Against the Baltimore Orioles in the 2012 ALDS, Suzuki ran home on a ball hit by Robinson Canó. Despite the ball beating him to the plate, Orioles catcher Matt Wieters had difficulty tagging Suzuki, who evaded multiple tag attempts by jumping over and around Wieters. In Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS, Suzuki hit his first career postseason home run; however, the Yankees lost the series to the Detroit Tigers in 4 games.

On 19 December 2012, Suzuki finalized a $13 million deal for two years with the Yankees.

====2013====
On 25 June 2013, Suzuki hit a walk-off home run against Rangers pitcher Tanner Scheppers with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. Earlier in the game, three of his teammates had led off the fourth, fifth, and sixth innings with home runs, so all of the Yankees&#x27; runs in the game were provided by solo home runs.

On 21 August 2013, Suzuki collected his 4,000th professional career hit with a single off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher R. A. Dickey, becoming the seventh player in professional baseball history known to have reached the mark after Pete Rose, Ty Cobb, Julio Franco, Hank Aaron, Jigger Statz, and Stan Musial.

====2014====
On 10 July 2014, Suzuki collected his 2,800th MLB hit off of Cleveland Indians pitcher Scott Atchison in the top of the eighth inning at Progressive Field. On 9 August 2014, Suzuki hit a single in a game against the Astros to pass George Sisler on the all-time hit list with his 2,811th hit. Suzuki had previously broken Sisler&#x27;s single season hit record in the 2004 season.

===Miami Marlins (2015–2017)===
====2015====
On 23 January 2015, Suzuki agreed to a one-year, $2 million contract with the Miami Marlins. The Marlins originally planned for him to be their fourth outfielder, but he finished the season with 439 plate appearances due to team injuries—primarily Giancarlo Stanton, who suffered a season-ending injury on 26 June. On 25 April, Suzuki scored his 1,310th major league run, which, combined with the 658 runs he scored in Japan, surpassed the record for runs scored by a Japanese player set by Sadaharu Oh. On 18 June, he was batting .294 after playing in 64 of the Marlins&#x27; 68 games, but his average fell to .229 by season&#x27;s end. On 14 August at Busch Stadium, Suzuki singled off St. Louis Cardinals starter John Lackey to earn his 4,192nd top-level hit, passing Ty Cobb. On 29 July, Suzuki recorded his 2,900th major league hit, against Washington Nationals pitcher Doug Fister. On 18 August, Suzuki had his first four-hit game since 2013. On 31 August, against the Atlanta Braves, Suzuki scored his 2,000th professional run, combining his runs scored in MLB (1,342) and in Japan&#x27;s NPB (658). On 5 September, Suzuki recorded his 100th right field assist in the major leagues. In the season finale against the Philadelphia Phillies on 4 October, he made his major league pitching debut, completing the final inning and allowing one run and two hits in a 7–2 loss. For the 2015 season, he batted .229/.282/.279 with 11 stolen bases.

====2016====

On 6 October 2015, Suzuki and the Marlins agreed on a one-year, $2 million contract for the 2016 season. The deal also came with a $2 million club option for 2017. He stole his 500th career MLB base on 29 April 2016, against the Milwaukee Brewers, and led off the game with a single against Zach Davies to move ahead of Frank Robinson into 33rd place on the all-time MLB hit list with the 2,944th hit of his career.

On 15 June, Suzuki recorded his 4,257th career hit, breaking Pete Rose&#x27;s all-time record for hits in top tier professional baseball. Rose commented that &quot;I&#x27;m not trying to take anything away from Ichiro, he&#x27;s had a Hall of Fame career, but the next thing you know you&#x27;ll be counting his high school hits.&quot; This was in response to the Japanese media labeling Suzuki as the &quot;Hit King&quot;, claiming that Suzuki should be considered to be the all-time hits leader when his hits in Japan are included. American media was more divided on the significance of the accomplishment, though some major sources acknowledged the milestone as indicating Suzuki had become the greatest hitter in baseball.

On 7 August, Suzuki collected the 3,000th hit of his MLB career when he hit a triple off the right field wall at Coors Field playing against the Colorado Rockies. He is just the second player to reach that milestone by way of a triple, joining Hall of Famer Paul Molitor. He also became one of only seven players to have collected 3,000 hits and 500 stolen bases. At the end of his 16th season, Suzuki had played in exactly 2,500 major league games. Suzuki and Pete Rose are the only two players in MLB history to have accomplished playing in 2,500 games in their first 16 seasons.

After the 2016 season, the Marlins exercised their option on Suzuki&#x27;s contract for the 2017 season, and added an option for the 2018 season.

====2017====
On 19 April, Suzuki hit his first home run against his former team the Seattle Mariners, a 9th-inning drive off Evan Marshall. Suzuki scored his 1400th run in a 23 May game against the Oakland A&#x27;s.

On 14 June, Suzuki singled for his 365th interleague hit, passing Derek Jeter (364) to become the all-time leader in interleague hits. Suzuki finished 2017 with 368 interleague hits. This total would be surpassed by Miguel Cabrera on September 7, 2021.

On 25 June, Suzuki (age 43 and 246 days) became the oldest player to start a game in center field since at least 1900, breaking the record previously held by Rickey Henderson. On 29 June, Suzuki became the oldest active MLB player when Bartolo Colón was designated for assignment by the Atlanta Braves, although Colon latched on with the Minnesota Twins a few weeks later. On 6 July, Suzuki hit two singles against the St. Louis Cardinals, bringing his hits total to 3,054 and surpassing Panamanian-born Rod Carew as the all-time leader in MLB hits among foreign-born players. Dominican-born Adrian Beltre surpassed Suzuki as the foreign hits leader on 13 June 2018.

On 26 August, Suzuki set the Marlins&#x27; single-season franchise record for pinch-hits with his 22nd pinch hit. On 3 September, he set a major league record for most pinch-hit at-bats in a season, with 84, and four days later he set a major league record for most pinch-hit plate appearances in a season, with 95. On 8 September, Suzuki became the sixth player all-time to hit 2,500 career singles, as well as the 8th right fielder of all-time to record over 4,000 putouts at the position. On 1 October, Suzuki flied out in his last chance to tie John Vander Wal&#x27;s MLB record of 28 pinch hits in a season, finishing with 27.

For the season, he batted .255/.318/.332 with one stolen base (the first season in which he did not steal at least 10 bases). After the season, the Marlins declined a $2 million club option for the 2018 season, instead paying Suzuki a $500,000 buyout.

===Seattle Mariners (2018–2019)===
====2018====

On 7 March 2018, Suzuki signed a one-year contract to return to the Mariners after several team outfielders were injured during spring training. On Opening Day, 29 March, against the Cleveland Indians, Suzuki became the 20th outfielder all-time to record 5,000 career putouts at the position. At 44 years old, he entered the 2018 season as the second-oldest active player in baseball, behind only Bartolo Colón.

On 3 May, the Mariners announced that Suzuki would move to the front office as a special assistant to the chairman for the remainder of the season, but Suzuki did not rule out a possible return as a player for the 2019 season. In his final game for the year on the previous day, he went 0-for-3 with a walk, a strikeout, and a run in a 3–2 loss to the Oakland Athletics. This would end up being his last game played at Safeco Field. In 15 games played with the 2018 Mariners, Suzuki batted 9-for-44 (.205/.255/.205) without an extra base hit, stolen base, or RBI.

On 11 May, he became the interim bench coach for two games as manager Scott Servais was gone to attend his daughter&#x27;s college graduation and regular bench coach Manny Acta was filling in as manager.

====2019====
On 2 October 2018, it was announced that Suzuki would be on the Mariners&#x27; active roster when they opened the 2019 season against the Oakland Athletics in Japan. Suzuki was re-signed to a minor league deal on 23 January 2019.

On 20 March 2019, the Mariners opened the MLB season against the Athletics at the Tokyo Dome and Suzuki started the game in right field, becoming at 45 years old the second oldest position player (behind Julio Franco) to start for a team on its opening day. The next night, the Mariners again played the Athletics at the Tokyo Dome and Suzuki played in his final professional game. He went 0–4 at the plate and in the bottom of the eighth inning walked off the field to applause. Later in the day, Suzuki officially announced his retirement. He was the oldest active MLB player at the time.

2019 was Suzuki&#x27;s 19th season in the MLB, and including the nine years he played in Japan&#x27;s NPB, Suzuki&#x27;s 28 seasons of playing in baseball&#x27;s top-tiered leagues eclipsed the record of most seasons played by a position player held previously by 19th century MLB player Cap Anson. (MLB pitcher Nolan Ryan, like Anson, also played 27 seasons, while NPB pitcher Kimiyasu Kudo played 29 seasons).

On 30 April 2019, Suzuki renewed his role with the Mariners from the previous year as special assistant to the chairman.

==International career==
===2006: Inaugural World Baseball Classic===

Suzuki played for the Japan national baseball team in the inaugural World Baseball Classic in March 2006. During the 15 March Japan-Korea game, Suzuki was booed by some spectators during every at-bat, reportedly in response to a previous statement that he wanted to &quot;beat South Korea so badly that the South Koreans won&#x27;t want to play Japan for another 30 years.&quot; That, however, was an incorrect translation mostly spread to the public through ESPN. Suzuki was variously quoted as saying &quot;I want to win in a way that the opponent would think, &#x27;we cannot catch up with Japan for the coming 30 years&#x27;. We should not merely win the games.&quot; Japan would later beat Korea in the playoffs and win the tournament after defeating Cuba 10–6 in the finals. For the tournament, Suzuki had twelve hits including a home run, seven runs, and four stolen bases.

===2009: Second WBC championship===
Despite struggling uncharacteristically during most of the tournament, Suzuki provided the game-winning hit in the Championship game against South Korea. With two outs in the top of the tenth inning, he broke a 3–3 tie with a two-run single off a ball in the dirt. This would prove to be the margin of victory in Japan&#x27;s 5–3 defeat of South Korea. Suzuki ended the night 4-for-6, bringing his total to 6-for-10 in WBC championship games.

==Playing style==

Sportswriter Bruce Jenkins, writing in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, described Suzuki&#x27;s distinctive style of play:

There&#x27;s nobody like Ichiro in either league—now or ever. He exists strictly within his own world, playing a game 100 percent unfamiliar to everyone else. The game has known plenty of &#x27;slap&#x27; hitters, but none who sacrifice so much natural ability for the sake of the art. And he&#x27;ll go deep occasionally in games, looking very much like someone who could do it again, often ... [but] the man lives for hits, little tiny ones, and the glory of standing atop the world in that category. Every spring, scouts or media types write him off, swearing that opposing pitchers have found the key, and they are embarrassingly wrong.

While he is known for his hitting ability, he did not draw many walks. In 2004, when he set the single-season record for hits, his low walk total (49) led to him being on base a total of 315 times. It was the 58th-most times a player has reached base in a season and short of the major league record of 379 set by Babe Ruth in 1923.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized his inability to improve his power when his Mariner teams were often low-scoring while noting that he also did not steal bases as frequently as Rickey Henderson or Tim Raines. Suzuki, however, once commented, &quot;If I&#x27;m allowed to hit .220, I could probably hit 40 [home runs], but nobody wants that.&quot;

Suzuki has long been interested in pitching professionally, and he actually took the mound to pitch to one batter in the 1996 NPB All Star game, reaching close to in warm up pitches. In 2009, it was reported that during an early February workout at the World Baseball Classic his fastball was clocked at 92 mph. On the final day of the 2015 season on 4 October, Suzuki pitched in his first MLB game, throwing one complete inning at the end of a 7–2 Marlins loss against the Philadelphia Phillies, allowing one run on two hits. Less than three weeks before turning 42, he was still able to touch 88 mph with his fastball to go along with a mid 80s slider.

Suzuki is the only left-handed hitter in Major League history with at least 2,000 plate appearances against left-handed pitching to display a reverse platoon split—that is, he had better results hitting off left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers.

Suzuki received recognition for playing superior defense in right field, with above-average range and a strong and accurate throwing arm. During his career, he won 10 Gold Glove Awards.

==Personality and influence==

Suzuki is noted for his work ethic in arriving early for his team&#x27;s games, and for his calisthenic stretching exercises to stay limber even during the middle of the game. Continuing in Seattle the custom he began in Japan, he used his given name (written in rōmaji) on the back of his uniform instead of his family name, becoming the first player in Major League Baseball to do so since Vida Blue.

In addition to being a ten-time Gold Glove winner, Suzuki was a ten-time All-Star selection from 2001 to 2010. His success has been credited with opening the door for other Japanese players like former Yomiuri Giants slugger Hideki Matsui, former Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks catcher Kenji Johjima, former teammate So Taguchi, and former Seibu Lions infielder Kazuo Matsui and active players Shohei Ohtani and Seiya Suzuki to enter the Major Leagues. Suzuki&#x27;s career was followed closely in Japan, with national television news programs covering each of his at-bats, and with special tour packages arranged for Japanese fans to visit the United States to attend his games.

Suzuki&#x27;s agent, Tony Attanasio, described his client&#x27;s status: &quot;When you mail Ichiro something from the States, you only have to use that name on the address and he gets it [in Japan]. He&#x27;s that big.&quot; Suzuki&#x27;s status in Japan fueled interest in Major League Baseball in Japan, including the $275 million broadcasting rights deal between MLB and Dentsu Inc. in 2003.

Suzuki performs in TV commercials in Japan for ENEOS. His likeness is used as the basis of the character &quot;Kyoshiro&quot; in the anime and manga &quot;Major&quot;.

When he first came to the United States, he especially enjoyed trips to Kansas City to talk with former Negro leagues star Buck O&#x27;Neil. When O&#x27;Neil died in 2006, Suzuki sent a very large memorial wreath to the funeral service. The following year, he visited the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum while on a road trip to Kansas City and made what, as of 2016, remains the largest contribution ever made to the museum by an active MLB player.

When Suzuki was traded to the Yankees in July 2012, longtime Mariners fan Ben Gibbard (of Death Cab for Cutie) posted his tribute song, &quot;Ichiro&#x27;s Theme&quot;, on his SoundCloud page. The previous year, The Baseball Project had released the tribute song &quot;Ichiro Goes To The Moon&quot; on their album &quot;Volume 2: High and Inside&quot;, which Gibbard contributed backing vocals to.

==Legacy==
On 27 August 2022, Suzuki was inducted into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame.

On 16 January 2025, Suzuki was elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He appeared on 323 of the 349 valid ballots submitted, becoming the sixth overall highest vote percentage in the Hall&#x27;s history at 92.6%.

Later that month, Suzuki was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot, receiving 393 of a possible 394 votes, tying Derek Jeter for the second highest vote share in history. He became the first Asian player to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. On the same day, the Mariners announced that a ceremony would be held in August of that year to formally retire Ichiro&#x27;s uniform number 51 jersey.

== Endorsements ==
Over the course of his career, Suzuki has endorsed numerous Japanese brands, although he was more reluctant to enter endorsement deals with American companies. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, at one point in his career, Suzuki earned roughly $7 million annually from endorsements, most of which came from Japanese companies.

He was the face of Kirin Brewery, a Japanese beer brand. He has endorsed Japanese brands such as sporting goods company Mizuno Corporation, Nikko Cordial, NTT Communications, Asics, JXTG Nippon Oil &amp; Energy. Suzuki also endorsed Yunker energy drink on behalf of Sato Pharmaceutical and Oakley sunglasses.

As of 2001, Suzuki had deals with the US golfwear company Cutter &amp; Buck, Upper Deck trading card company, and sporting goods company Majestic Athletic.

Suzuki&#x27;s agent Tony Attanasio stated that Suzuki had rejected around $40 million in endorsements due to him being &quot;very selective when it comes to putting his name out in the public.&quot;

==Personal life==

He has an elder brother, Kazuyasu Suzuki.

Suzuki married , a former TBS TV announcer, on 3 December 1999, at a small church in Santa Monica, California. , they had a pet dog (Shiba Inu) named Ikkyu, a combination of the first character in each of his and his wife&#x27;s first names. The couple resided in Issaquah, Washington, during the season while he played in Seattle and in Greenwich, Connecticut, while he played for the Yankees. They resided in Miami Beach during seasons with the Marlins.
On 18 March 2011, Suzuki donated ¥100 million ($1.25 million) to the Japanese Red Cross for earthquake and tsunami relief efforts.

Suzuki&#x27;s father, Nobuyuki, handled Ichiro&#x27;s finances early in his career until, in 2002, due to Nobuyuki underreporting Ichiro&#x27;s income, Ichiro was saddled with a significant bill for unpaid taxes. The scandal cost Ichiro an undisclosed amount of money and caused him embarrassment. This incident, along with Nobuyuki&#x27;s relentless training and unforgiving attitude toward his son, caused their relationship to collapse. Subsequently, Ichiro&#x27;s finances have been looked after by his wife Yumiko.

Since November 2000, Nobuyuki has run the Ichiro exhibition room named &quot;I-fain&quot; in Toyoyama, Suzuki&#x27;s hometown. It exhibits a wide variety of Ichiro Suzuki memorabilia, including personal items from his childhood and up-to-date baseball gear.

Suzuki is the honored chairman of the Ichiro Cup, a six-month-long boys&#x27; league tournament with more than 200 teams, held in Toyoyama and surrounding cities and towns since 1996. Suzuki watches the final game and attends its awards ceremony every year.

Suzuki speaks English well and often spoke it with his teammates in his playing days, but uses an interpreter during interviews so that he is not misunderstood. He also learned Spanish early in his MLB career, using it to banter with other players. Suzuki further explains he did it because he felt a kinship to the Latin American players who, like him, were foreigners trying to succeed in the U.S.

<doc id="66419" wikidata="Q17582" url="?curid=66419" title="Affricate">
<text>An affricate is a consonant that begins as a stop and releases as a fricative, generally with the same place of articulation (most often coronal). It is often difficult to decide if a stop and fricative form a single phoneme or a consonant pair. English has two affricate phonemes, and , often spelled &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, respectively.

==Examples==
The English sounds spelled &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;j&quot; (broadly transcribed as and in the IPA), German and Italian &quot;z&quot; and Italian &quot;z&quot; are typical affricates, and sounds like these are fairly common in the world&#x27;s languages, as are other affricates with similar sounds, such as those in Polish and Chinese. However, voiced affricates other than are relatively uncommon. For several places of articulation they are not attested at all.

Much less common are labiodental affricates, such as in German, Kinyarwanda and Izi, or velar affricates, such as in Tswana (written &quot;kg&quot;) or in High Alemannic Swiss German dialects. Worldwide, relatively few languages have affricates in these positions even though the corresponding stop consonants, and , are common or virtually universal. Also less common are alveolar affricates where the fricative release is lateral, such as the sound found in Nahuatl and Navajo. Some other Athabaskan languages, such as Dene Suline, have unaspirated, aspirated, and ejective series of affricates whose release may be dental, alveolar, postalveolar, or lateral: , , , , , , , , , , , and .

==Notation==
Affricates are transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet by a combination of two letters, one for the stop element and the other for the fricative element. In order to show that these are parts of a single consonant, a tie bar is generally used. The tie bar appears most commonly above the two letters, but may be placed under them if it fits better there, or simply because it is more legible. Thus:
or

A less common notation indicates the release of the affricate with a superscript:
This is derived from the IPA convention of indicating other releases with a superscript. However, this convention is more typically used for a fricated release that is too brief to be considered a true affricate.

Though they are no longer standard IPA, ligatures are available in Unicode for the sibilant affricates, which remain in common use:

Approved for Unicode in 2024, per request from the IPA, are the remaining coronal affricates:
: for .

Any of these notations can be used to distinguish an affricate from a sequence of a stop plus a fricative, which is contrastive in languages such as Polish. However, in languages where there is no such distinction, such as English or Turkish, a simple sequence of letters is commonly used, with no overt indication that they form an affricate.

In other phonetic transcription systems, such as the Americanist system, affricates may be transcribed with single letters. The affricate may be transcribed as or ; as , or (older) ; as or ; as , or (older) ; as ; and as . 

This also happens with phonemic transcription in IPA: and are sometimes transcribed with the symbols for the palatal stops, and , for example in the IPA &quot;Handbook&quot;.

==Affricates vs. stop–fricative sequences==
In some languages, affricates contrast phonemically with stop–fricative sequences:
*Polish affricate in &quot;czysta&quot; &#x27;clean (f.)&#x27; versus stop–fricative in &quot;trzysta&quot; &#x27;three hundred&#x27;.
*Klallam affricate in &quot;k&#x27;ʷə́nc&quot; &#x27;look at me&#x27; versus stop–fricative in &quot;k&#x27;ʷə́nts&quot; &#x27;he looks at it&#x27;.

The exact phonetic difference varies between languages. In stop–fricative sequences, the stop has a release burst before the fricative starts; but in affricates, the fricative element &quot;is&quot; the release. Phonologically, stop–fricative sequences may have a syllable boundary between the two segments, but not necessarily.

In English, and (&quot;nuts&quot;, &quot;nods&quot;) are considered phonemically stop–fricative sequences. They often contain a morpheme boundary (for example, &quot;nuts&quot; = &quot;nut&quot; + &quot;s&quot;). The English affricate phonemes and do not contain morpheme boundaries.

The phonemic distinction in English between the affricate and the stop–fricative sequence (found across syllable boundaries) can be observed by minimal pairs such as the following:

*&quot;worst shin&quot; → 
*&quot;worse chin&quot; → 

In some accents of English, the in &#x27;worst shin&#x27; debuccalizes to a glottal stop before .

Stop–fricatives can be distinguished acoustically from affricates by the rise time of the frication noise, which is shorter for affricates.

==Geminate affricates==
When affriates are geminated, it is the duration of the plosive closure that is lengthened, not that of the frication. For example, is pronounced , not *.

==List of affricates==
In the case of coronals, the symbols are normally used for the stop portion of the affricate regardless of place. For example, is commonly seen for .

The exemplar languages are ones that have been reported to have these sounds, but in several cases, they may need confirmation.

===Sibilant affricates===
The Northwest Caucasian languages Abkhaz and Ubykh both contrast sibilant affricates at four places of articulation: alveolar, postalveolar, alveolo-palatal and retroflex. They also distinguish voiceless, voiced, and ejective affricates at each of these.

When a language has only one type of affricate, it is usually a sibilant; this is the case in e.g. Arabic (), most dialects of Spanish (), and Thai ().

===Non-sibilant affricates===

===Lateral affricates===

===Trilled affricates===


Pirahã and Wari&#x27; have a dental stop with bilabial trilled release .

===Heterorganic affricates===
Although most affricates are homorganic, Navajo and Chiricahua Apache have a heterorganic alveolar-velar affricate . Wari&#x27; and Pirahã have a voiceless dental bilabially trilled affricate [t̪ʙ̥] (see #Trilled affricates), Blackfoot has . Other heterorganic affricates are reported for Northern Sotho and other Bantu languages such as Phuthi, which has alveolar–labiodental affricates and , and Sesotho, which has bilabial–palatoalveolar affricates and . Djeoromitxi has and .

===Phonation, coarticulation and other variants===
The coronal and dorsal places of articulation attested as ejectives as well: . Several Khoisan languages such as Taa are reported to have voiced ejective affricates, but these are actually &quot;pre&quot;-voiced: . Affricates are also commonly aspirated: , murmured: , and prenasalized: (as in Hmong). Labialized, palatalized, velarized, and pharyngealized affricates are also common. Affricates may also have phonemic length, that is, affected by a chroneme, as in Italian and Karelian.

==Phonological representation==

In phonology, affricates tend to behave similarly to stops, taking part in phonological patterns that fricatives do not. analyzes phonetic affricates as phonological stops. A sibilant or lateral (and presumably trilled) stop can be realized phonetically only as an affricate and so might be analyzed phonemically as a sibilant or lateral stop. In that analysis, affricates other than sibilants and laterals are a phonetic mechanism for distinguishing stops at similar places of articulation (like more than one labial, coronal, or dorsal place). For example, Chipewyan has laminal dental vs. apical alveolar ; other languages may contrast velar with palatal and uvular .
Affricates may also be a strategy to increase the phonetic contrast between aspirated or ejective and tenuis consonants.

According to , no language contrasts a non-sibilant, non-lateral affricate with a stop at the same place of articulation and with the same phonation and airstream mechanism, such as and or and .

In feature-based phonology, affricates are distinguished from stops by the feature [+delayed release].

== Affrication ==
Affrication (sometimes called &quot;affricatization&quot;) is a sound change by which a consonant, usually a stop or fricative, changes into an affricate. Examples include:
* Proto-Germanic &gt; Modern English , as in &quot;chin&quot; (cf. : Anglo-Frisian palatalization)
* Proto-Semitic &gt; Standard Arabic in all positions, as in () (cf. Aramaic: גמלא (gamlā&#x27;), (), and ()).
* Early Modern English &gt; (yod-coalescence)
* &gt; in the High German consonant shift
* &gt; before respectively in 16th-century Japanese
* &gt; word-initially in Udmurt
* Polish &gt; 

== Pre-affrication ==
In rare instances, a fricative–stop contour may occur. This is the case in dialects of Scottish Gaelic that have velar frication where other dialects have pre-aspiration. For example, in the Harris dialect there is &#x27;seven&#x27; and &#x27;eight&#x27; (or , ). Richard Wiese argues this is the case for word-initial fricative-plosive sequences in German, and coined the term suffricate for such contours. Awngi has 2 suffricates and according to some analyses.

<doc id="66422" wikidata="Q1558982" url="?curid=66422" title="MOVE (Philadelphia organization)">
<text>MOVE (pronounced like the word &quot;move&quot;), originally the Christian Movement for Life, is a communal organization that advocates for nature laws and natural living, founded in 1972 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, by John Africa (born Vincent Leaphart). MOVE lived in a communal setting in West Philadelphia, abiding by philosophies of anarcho-primitivism. The group combined revolutionary ideology, similar to that of the Black Panthers, with work for animal rights.

MOVE is particularly known for two major conflicts with the Philadelphia Police Department (PPD). In 1978, a standoff resulted in the death of police officer James J. Ramp and injuries to 16 officers and firefighters, as well as members of the MOVE organization. Nine members were convicted of killing the officer and each received prison sentences of 30 to 100 years. In 1985, another firefight ended when a police helicopter dropped two bombs onto the roof of the MOVE compound, a townhouse located at 6221 Osage Avenue. The resulting fire killed six MOVE members and five of their children, and destroyed 65 houses in the neighborhood.

The police bombing was strongly condemned. The MOVE survivors later filed a civil suit against the City of Philadelphia and the PPD and were awarded $1.5 million in a 1996 settlement. Other residents displaced by the destruction of the bombing filed a civil suit against the city and in 2005 were awarded $12.83 million in damages in a jury trial.

== Origins ==
The group&#x27;s name, MOVE, is not an acronym. Its founder, John Africa, chose this name to say what they intended to do. Members intend to be active because they say, &quot;Everything that&#x27;s alive moves. If it didn&#x27;t, it would be stagnant, dead.&quot; When members greet each other they say &quot;on the MOVE&quot;.

When the organization was founded in 1972, John Africa was functionally illiterate. He dictated his thoughts to Donald Glassey, a social worker from the University of Pennsylvania, and created what he called &quot;The Guidelines&quot; as the basis for his communal group. Africa and his mostly African-American followers wore their hair in dreadlocks, as popularized by Rastafari. MOVE advocated a radical form of green politics and a return to a hunter-gatherer society, while stating their opposition to science, medicine, and technology.

Members of MOVE identify as deeply religious and advocate for life. They believe that as all living beings are dependent, their lives should be treated as equally important. They advocate for justice that is not always based within institutions. MOVE members believe that for something to be just, it must be just for all living creatures. As John Africa had done, his followers changed their surnames to &quot;Africa&quot; to show reverence to what they regarded as their mother continent.

In a 2018 article about the group, Ed Pilkington of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described their political views as &quot;a strange fusion of black power and flower power. The group that formed in the early 1970s melded the revolutionary ideology of the Black Panthers with the nature- and animal-loving communalism of 1960s hippies. You might characterise them as black liberationists-cum-eco warriors.&quot; He noted the group also functioned as an animal rights advocacy organization. Pilkington quoted member Janine Africa, who wrote to him from prison: &quot;We demonstrated against puppy mills, zoos, circuses, any form of enslavement of animals. We demonstrated against Three Mile Island and industrial pollution. We demonstrated against police brutality. And we did so uncompromisingly. Slavery never ended, it was just disguised.&quot;

John Africa and his followers lived in a commune in a house owned by Glassey in the Powelton Village section of West Philadelphia. As activists, they staged demonstrations against institutions that they opposed, such as zoos, and speakers whose views they opposed. MOVE activities were scrutinized by law enforcement authorities, particularly under the administration of Mayor Frank Rizzo, a former police commissioner known for his hard line against activist groups.

In 1977, three MOVE members were jailed for inciting a riot, occasioning further tension, protests, and armed displays from the group.

=== 1978 shoot-out ===
In 1977, according to police accounts, the Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) obtained a court order for MOVE to vacate the Powelton Village property in response to a series of complaints made by neighbors. MOVE members agreed to vacate and surrender their weapons if the PPD released members of their group held in city jails.

Nearly a year later, on August 8, 1978, the PPD came to a standoff with members of MOVE who had not left the Powelton Village property. When police attempted to enter the house, a shootout ensued. PPD Officer James J. Ramp of the Stakeout Unit (now known as the S.W.A.T. Unit), was killed by a gunshot to the neck. 16 police officers and firefighters were also injured in the firefight. MOVE representatives claimed that Ramp was facing the house at the time and denied that the group was responsible for his death, insisting that he was killed by fire from fellow police officers. Prosecutors alleged that MOVE members fired the fatal shot and charged Debbie Sims Africa and eight other MOVE members with collective responsibility for his death.

According to a 2018 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, 
&quot;Eyewitnesses, however, gave accounts suggesting that the shot may have come from the opposite direction to the basement, raising the possibility that Ramp was accidentally felled by police fire. MOVE members continue to insist that they had no workable guns in their house at the time of the siege. Several months earlier, in May 1978, several guns – most of them inoperative – had been handed over to police at the MOVE house; however, prosecutors at the trial of the MOVE Nine told the jury that at the time of the August siege there had been functioning firearms in the house.&quot;The standoff lasted about an hour before MOVE members began to surrender.

===The MOVE 9===
The nine members of MOVE charged with third-degree murder for Ramp&#x27;s death became known as the MOVE 9. Each was sentenced to a maximum of 100 years in prison. They were Chuck, Delbert, Eddie, Janet, Janine, Merle, Michael, Phil, and Debbie Sims Africa.

In 1998, at age 47, Merle Africa died in prison. Seven of the surviving eight members first became eligible for parole in the spring of 2008, but they were denied. Parole hearings for each of these prisoners were to be held yearly from that time. In 2015, at age 59, Phil Africa died in prison. 

The first of the MOVE 9 to be released was Debbie Sims Africa on June 16, 2018. Debbie Sims Africa, who was 22 when sentenced, was released on parole and reunited with her 39-year-old son, Michael Davis Africa, Jr. She gave birth to him a month after she was imprisoned, and he was taken from her a week later. The release of Debbie Sims Africa renewed attention on members of MOVE and the Black Panthers who remain imprisoned in the U.S. from the period of the 1960s and 1970s. &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Ed Pilkington reported in June 2018 that there were at least 25 still in prison.

On October 23, 2018, Michael Davis Africa, the husband of Debbie Sims Africa, was released on parole. In May 2019, Janine and Janet Africa were released on parole after 41 years of imprisonment. On June 21, 2019, Eddie Goodman Africa was released on parole. Delbert Orr Africa was granted parole on December 20, 2019, and released January 18, 2020. The last of the MOVE 9 either to be paroled or to die behind bars was Chuck Sims Africa, who was released on parole on February 7, 2020, after 41 years of imprisonment. Both Delbert and Chuck died of cancer in 2020 and 2021, respectively.

== 1985 bombing ==
In 1981, MOVE relocated to a row house at 6221 Osage Avenue in the Cobbs Creek area of West Philadelphia. Neighbors complained to the city for years about trash around their building, confrontations with neighbors, and bullhorn announcements of sometimes obscene political messages by MOVE members. The bullhorn was broken and inoperable for the three weeks prior to the police bombing of the row house.

The police obtained arrest warrants in 1985 charging four MOVE occupants with crimes including parole violations, contempt of court, illegal possession of firearms, and making terrorist threats. Mayor Wilson Goode and police commissioner Gregore J. Sambor classified MOVE as a terrorist organization. Police evacuated residents of the area from the neighborhood prior to their action. Residents were told that they would be able to return to their homes after a 24-hour period.

On Monday, May 13, 1985, nearly five hundred police officers, along with city manager Leo Brooks, arrived in force and attempted to clear the building and execute the arrest warrants. Nearby houses were evacuated. Water and electricity were shut off in order to force MOVE members out of the house. Commissioner Sambor read a long speech addressed to MOVE members that started with, &quot;Attention MOVE: This is America. You have to abide by the laws of the United States.&quot; When the MOVE members did not respond, the police decided to forcibly remove the 13 members from the house, which consisted of seven adults and six children.

There was an armed standoff with police, who lobbed tear gas canisters at the building. The MOVE members fired at them in return, and a 90-minute gunfight ensued, in which one officer was bruised in the back by gunfire. Police used more than ten thousand rounds of ammunition before Commissioner Sambor ordered that the compound be bombed. From a Pennsylvania State Police helicopter, Philadelphia Police Department Lt. Frank Powell proceeded to drop two one-pound bombs (which the police referred to as &quot;entry devices&quot;) made of FBI-supplied Tovex, a dynamite substitute, targeting a cubicle on the roof of the house. The ensuing fire killed eleven of the people in the house (John Africa, five other adults, and five children aged 7 to 13). The fire spread and eventually destroyed approximately 65 nearby houses on Osage Avenue and nearby Pine Street. Although firefighters had earlier drenched the building prior to the bombing, after the fire broke out, officials said they feared that MOVE would shoot at the firefighters, so held them back.

Ramona Africa, one of the two MOVE survivors from the house, said that police fired at those trying to escape.

=== Aftermath ===
Goode appointed an investigative commission called the Philadelphia Special Investigation Commission (PSIC, aka MOVE Commission), chaired by attorney William H. Brown, III. Sambor resigned in November 1985; in a speech the following year, he said that he was made a &quot;surrogate&quot; by Goode.

The MOVE Commission issued its report on March 6, 1986. The report denounced the actions of the city government, stating that &quot;Dropping a bomb on an occupied row house was unconscionable.&quot; Following the release of the report, Goode made a formal public apology. No one from the city government was criminally charged in the attack. The only surviving adult MOVE member, Ramona Africa, was charged and convicted on charges of riot and conspiracy; she served seven years in prison.

In 1996 a federal jury ordered the city to pay a $1.5 million civil suit judgment to survivor Ramona Africa and relatives of two people killed in the bombing. The jury had found that the city used excessive force and violated the members&#x27; constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure. In 1985 Philadelphia was given the sobriquet &quot;The City that Bombed Itself&quot;.

In 2005 federal judge Clarence Charles Newcomer presided over a civil trial brought by residents seeking damages for having been displaced by the widespread destruction following the 1985 police bombing of MOVE. A jury awarded them a $12.83 million verdict against the City of Philadelphia.

On November 12, 2020, the City Council of Philadelphia passed a resolution apologizing “for the decisions and events preceding and leading to the devastation that occurred on May 13, 1985.” The council established “an annual day of observation, reflection and recommitment” to remember the MOVE Bombing.

== 2002 shooting of John Gilbride ==
After John Africa&#x27;s death, his widow, Alberta, married John Gilbride, Jr. Together they had a child, Zackary Africa, before divorcing in 1999. By 2002, Gilbride had no longer supported MOVE and resettled in Maple Shade, New Jersey. Alberta Africa was living in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, with their son, John Zachary Gilbride, as he was legally known.

On September 10, 2002, in the course of their bitter custody dispute, Gilbride testified in court that MOVE had threatened to kill him. The court granted Gilbride partial custody of Zackary, allowing him unsupervised visits.

On September 27, shortly after midnight and prior to Gilbride&#x27;s first visitation date with Zackary, an unknown assailant shot and killed him as he sat in a car parked outside his New Jersey apartment complex. Investigators did not name a suspect and the Burlington County Police did not release ballistics information.

The case remains unsolved. A MOVE spokeswoman initially said that the U.S. government had assassinated Gilbride in order to frame MOVE. His ex-wife Alberta Africa denied that the murder had occurred. She said in 2009 that Gilbride &quot;is out hiding somewhere&quot;. Tony Allen, an ex-MOVE member, says that MOVE murdered Gilbride.

In 2012, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reported that Gilbride had told friends and family that he had recorded incriminating evidence in a notebook as security against a &quot;hit&quot; by MOVE. Gilbride said he had placed the notebook inside a locker for safekeeping. The Burlington County Prosecutor&#x27;s Office declined to follow up on the report.

== Child abuse and cult allegations ==
In 2021, former members of MOVE came forward with allegations of abuse within the organization. As Jason Nark writes in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer,&quot; “More than a half-dozen ex-MOVE members have gone on the record in both the &quot;Murder at Ryan’s Run&quot; podcast and the blog (started by an ex-MOVE supporter) titled &quot;Leaving MOVE 2021&quot;, alleging physical and mental abuse in MOVE, a doctrine of homophobia and colorism, and what they describe as a manipulation of the public and the media under the banner of social justice.&quot;

== Current activities ==
Ramona Africa acts as a spokesperson for the group. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of MOVE, was convicted and sentenced to death for the unrelated 1981 murder of police officer Daniel Faulkner. The death sentence was overturned in 2011 by a federal judge and Abu-Jamal was resentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. MOVE continues to advocate for Abu-Jamal&#x27;s release.

 Michael Moses Ward, known in MOVE as Birdie Africa, was the only child to survive the 1985 bombing. Ward was 13 years old at the time of the incident and suffered serious burns from the fire, which killed his mother. Ward&#x27;s father, Andino Ward, sued the City of Philadelphia, and the parties reached a settlement. He lived with his father afterward and did not remain involved with MOVE. He died in 2013 in an accidental drowning.

In June 2020 MOVE member Delbert Africa died.

In April 2021, the Penn Museum and the University of Pennsylvania apologized to the Africa family for allowing human remains from the MOVE house to be used in research and training. In 1985, the Philadelphia City Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office gave burned human remains found at the MOVE house to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology for verification that the bones were those of 14-year-old Tree Africa and 12-year-old Delisha Africa. The remains were kept in a cardboard box in storage for decades and studied by Alan Mann, a professor at Penn and Janet Monge, the curator of the Penn Museum. The bones were used as part of an online forensic course as a case study. When Mann transferred to Princeton University in 2001, he reportedly took the remains with him.

Philadelphia Health Commissioner Thomas Farley resigned in May 2021 upon revelations that he ordered the cremation of a set of victims&#x27; remains without notifying or obtaining permission from the families of the deceased or even releasing the names of the deceased. The day after his resignation, the remains were recovered in a box labeled MOVE.

== Legacy ==

On the 25th anniversary of the 1985 bombing, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; published a detailed multimedia website containing retrospective articles, archived articles, videos, interviews, photos, and a timeline of the events.

John Edgar Wideman&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;Philadelphia Fire&quot; is based on the MOVE bombing.

Mischief Brew’s 2006 song &quot;Save A City…&quot; is about the MOVE bombing.

=== Documentaries ===
&quot;The Bombing of Osage Avenue&quot; (1986) by author Toni Cade Bambara and Louis Massiah provides context for the bombing by using the history of the Cobbs Creek community. It focuses on the bombing&#x27;s effects on community residents who did not belong to MOVE. The film also uses footage of the hearings of the MOVE commission. It premiered on WHYY-TV, Philadelphia&#x27;s public broadcasting station.

&quot;Let the Fire Burn&quot; (2013) by producer/director Jason Osder about MOVE composed largely of archival footage.

&quot;&quot; (2019) by Matt Wolf also featured footage of the group on the ABC news show &quot;Nightline&quot;.

&quot;40 Years a Prisoner&quot; (2020) by filmmaker Tommy Oliver chronicles the controversial 1978 Philadelphia police raid on MOVE and the aftermath that led to a Mike Africa Jr.&#x27;s decades-long fight to free his parents.

<text>Stormbringer is a magic sword featured in a number of fantasy stories by the author Michael Moorcock. It is described as a huge, black sword covered with strange runes, created by the forces of Chaos. The sword has a will of its own and it is hinted that the sword may be controlled by an inhabiting entity. It is wielded by the doomed albino emperor Elric of Melniboné. Stormbringer makes its first appearance in the 1961 novella &quot;The Dreaming City&quot;. In the four novellas collected in the 1965 book &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, the sword&#x27;s true nature is revealed.

== Description ==
This powerful enchanted black blade is a member of a demon race that takes on the form of a sword, and as such is an agent of Chaos. Stormbringer&#x27;s edge is capable of cutting through virtually any material not protected by potent sorcery, and it can drink the soul from (and thereby kill) any unprotected living creature upon delivering any wound, even a scratch. Its most distinctive features are that it has a mind and will of its own, and that it feeds upon the souls of those it kills. Elric loathes the sword but is almost helpless without the strength and vitality it confers on him.

Stormbringer&#x27;s hunger for souls is such that it frequently betrays Elric by creating a bloodlust in his mind, turning in his hands and killing friends and lovers. The cursed nature of the sword adds to Elric&#x27;s guilt and self-loathing, even as he feels pleasure when the stolen lifeforce enters his body.

Stormbringer has a &quot;brother&quot; sword named Mournblade, which was at one time wielded by Elric&#x27;s cousin and enemy Yyrkoon. It is identical to Stormbringer in most regards. Later stories reveal that there are thousands of identical demons, all taking the form of swords. Three such sibling blades appear in &quot;The Revenge of the Rose&quot; and many more &quot;brother blades&quot; are seen in the novel &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, but only Mournblade and Stormbringer are named.

In &quot;Elric of Melniboné&quot;, Elric and cousin Yyrkoon find the runeblades in a realm of Limbo and commence battle. Elric and Stormbringer disarm Yyrkoon, and Mournblade disappears. Yyrkoon is defeated, and Elric and his cousin return to Imrryr.

In &quot;The Weird of the White Wolf&quot;, Elric returns to Imrryr after a long journey and confronts Yyrkoon, who usurped the throne in his absence. Yyrkoon has regained Mournblade through unknown means and uses it to attack. Elric and Stormbringer kill Yyrkoon, and no further mention is made of Mournblade until it is later disclosed that it was recovered by the Seers of Nihrain, to be wielded by Elric&#x27;s cousin, Dyvim Slorm. Imrryr is sacked, though the pillagers&#x27; fate is not much better, being pursued by the golden battle barges and the few dragons who were awakened, led by Dyvim Tvar. Only Elric&#x27;s ship escapes, propelled by the aid of his sorcery.

In &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, Elric learns that the representatives of Fate, which serve neither Chaos nor Law, recovered Mournblade from the netherworld. They present it to Elric and explain that the runeblades were designed to be wielded by those with Melnibonéan royal blood as a check against the might of powerful beings including the Dead Gods of Chaos. Elric gives Mournblade to his kinsman, Dyvim Slorm, and the two men become embroiled in a confrontation between the gods. Elric summons others of Stormbringer&#x27;s demonic race (also in the form of swords) to fight against a number of Dukes of Hell, brought to the Young Kingdoms by Jagreen Lern, theocrat of Pan Tang.

Ultimately, Elric&#x27;s reliance on Stormbringer proves his undoing: after the utter destruction of the Young Kingdoms in the battle of Law and Chaos, just as it seems that the cosmic Balance has been restored, Stormbringer kills Elric, transforms into a humanoid demon, and leaps laughing into the sky, to corrupt the newly-remade world once more. The sword-spirit says to the dead Elric: &quot;Farewell, friend. I was a thousand times more evil than thou!&quot;

In the book &quot;The Quest for Tanelorn&quot;, a character claims that the demon in the sword is named Shaitan – a variant of &#x27;Satan&#x27;, and in Arabic a word meaning a devil, if not the Devil. In the same book it is revealed that the demon can inhabit either the black sword or the black jewel, the jewel which was once embedded in the skull of Dorian Hawkmoon. Hawkmoon was an avatar, like Elric, of the Eternal Champion.

==Analysis==
The theme of a cursed magical sword which causes evil deeds when drawn goes back to the sword Tyrfing in Norse Mythology, with which Moorcock was likely familiar. Stormbringer was influential in popularizing this trope in the fantasy genre. Moorcock intended the sword character to serve as a key element of his discussion of &quot;how mankind&#x27;s wish-fantasies can bring about the destruction of... part of mankind&quot;. Claiming influence from Freud and Jung he says: &quot;The whole point of Elric&#x27;s soul-eating sword, Stormbringer, was addiction: to sex, to violence, to big, black, phallic swords, to drugs, to escape. That&#x27;s why it went down so well in the rock’n’roll world&quot;.

Literature scholar Dennis Wilson Wise wrote that &quot;a weapon like Stormbringer reinforces liberal selfhood in a particularly concrete way. It carries a continuous external threat to personal autonomy, and it subverts a fully rational self-determination. Modern fantasy heroes, especially in epic fantasy, often rail against &quot;destiny&quot; or a prophecy, but such destinies and prophecies lack Stormbringer&#x27;s sentient specificity.&quot;

Ontologist Levi Bryant stated that Stormbringer belongs to a special class of magical items which also appear in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which are not &quot;merely passive tools&quot;, but have will, goals, alignment and a personality of their own. Stormbringer talks to, influences and struggles with its wielder Elric. Bryant saw the sword as an active entity, not unlike &quot;some of the artificial life we are developing today&quot;, and also compared it to &quot;technologies unleashed on the world that are agents in their own right&quot;.

==Books featuring Stormbringer==

Elric&#x27;s sword Stormbringer has appeared in all of Michael Moorcock&#x27;s stories about Elric, except the prequel &quot;Folk of the Forest&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

* &quot;Tom Strong&quot; No. 31 and No. 32, &quot;The Black Blade of the Barbary Coast&quot; parts 1 &amp; 2 by Alan Moore, feature albino pirate Captain Zodiac seeking the &quot;Black Blade&quot;, a black cutlass marked with red runes. This appears to be a recurrence (a favoured Moorcock trope) of Elric and Stormbringer&#x27;s tale. Almost all of Moorcock&#x27;s stories about the Eternal Champion include a parallel or analog to Stormbringer, invariably wielded by the Champion. 
* Lawrence Watt-Evans explicitly mentioned Moorcock&#x27;s &quot;Stormbringer&quot; as an inspiration for the enchanted &quot;Black Dagger&quot;, which is at the center of his own novel &quot;The Spell of the Black Dagger&quot; and which is in many ways similar – though not identical – to Stormbringer. 
* &quot;Black Blade&quot;, the opening track of American hard rock band Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s seventh studio effort, &quot;Cultösaurus Erectus&quot;, concerns itself with Stormbringer. Moorcock himself made significant contributions to the track, having previously established a working relationship with the musical group. 
* The 1979 &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventure module &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot;, written by Lawrence Schick and published by TSR, featured a magical sword called Blackrazor, a black-bladed vampiric blade created from an extra-dimensional being. Schick later said that he was &quot;a little embarrassed to this day by Blackrazor, inasmuch as it&#x27;s such a blatant rip-off of Elric&#x27;s Stormbringer; I would not have put it into the scenario if I ever thought it might be published&quot;.
* The Melnibonéan character profiles are included in the first edition of &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot;, a TSR AD&amp;D resource.
* In the opening animation short for the 1983 Daicon IV Nihon SF Taikai convention, the &#x27;Bunny Girl&#x27; is shown riding a sword with the same visual design as Stormbringer as one of numerous classic fantasy and sci-fi references in the film.
* In the fighting game series &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, the character Heidern possesses a special move named &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, where he stabs and drains life from the enemy.
* In the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; episode, &quot;The Lion and the Rose&quot;, one name that the crowd shouts out as a name for Joffrey Baratheon&#x27;s Valyrian steel sword is &quot;Stormbringer&quot;.
* In &quot;Ready Player Two&quot;, written by Ernest Cline, Nolan Sorrento yields Stormbringer after his escape from A Maximum-Security Prison.
* In &quot;Stardew Valley&quot; the level 4 Shadow Dagger has the description &quot;when you hold the blade to your ear you can hear 1,000 souls shrieking&quot;. A reference to Stormbringer.
* In 1974, Deep Purple released an album titled &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, which included a song of the same name.
* In 2014, Grand Magus released the song &quot;Steel Versus Steel&quot; [from the album Triumph and Power] which is about Elric and Stormbringer.

<doc id="66426" wikidata="Q207699" url="?curid=66426" title="Waterloo &amp; City line">
<text>The Waterloo &amp; City line, colloquially known as The Drain, is a shuttle line of the London Underground that runs between Waterloo and Bank with no intermediate stops. Its primary traffic consists of commuters from south-west London, Surrey and Hampshire arriving at Waterloo main line station and travelling forward to the City of London financial district. For this reason, the line has historically not operated on Sundays or public holidays, except in very limited circumstances. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the line is currently only open on weekdays. It is one of only two lines on the Underground network to run completely underground, the other being the Victoria line.

Printed in turquoise on the Tube map, it is by far the shortest line on the Underground network, being long, with an end-to-end journey lasting just four minutes. In absolute terms, it is the least-used Tube line, carrying just over 17 million passengers annually. However, in terms of the average number of journeys per kilometre it is the third-most intensively-used line behind the Jubilee and Victoria lines.

The line was built by the Waterloo &amp; City Railway Company and was opened in 1898 (at the time, Bank station was named &quot;City&quot;). When it opened it was the second electric underground railway in London, following the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line). Its construction was supported by the London and South Western Railway, whose main line trains ran into Waterloo, and for many years it continued to be owned and operated by the LSWR and its successors as a part of the national railway network, not as part of the London Underground network it resembled. Following a major refurbishment and replacement of rolling stock by Network SouthEast in the early 1990s, operations were transferred to London Underground in 1994.

==History==
===Background===
The London and South Western Railway (LSWR) reached Waterloo Bridge on 11 July 1848, serving routes from Southampton and Richmond. It was officially renamed Waterloo in October 1882.

That the station was not within walking distance of the City of London was viewed as a serious shortcoming. The LSWR had hoped to build a line eastwards to near London Bridge but because of the slump following the railway mania, and the high cost of building through the area, this idea was abandoned. When the South Eastern Railway opened an extension from London Bridge to Charing Cross in 1864, a connecting railway line from it to Waterloo was built, but friction and competitive hostility between the companies meant the line saw no regular passenger movements. Under pressure from the LSWR, the SER constructed Waterloo Junction station, now called Waterloo East, on the Charing Cross line. The station opened in January 1869, but through ticketing was refused and the onward connection remained frustratingly unsatisfactory.

====Independent proposals====
A Waterloo and Whitehall Railway was promoted in 1864, to construct a tube railway from Great Scotland Yard to Waterloo. It was to use air pressure to propel the vehicles northwards, and exhaust air to draw them southwards, using a pressure differential of oz per sq in (about 11 mbar). The trains themselves would be the pistons. The company capital was to be £100,000. It was suggested that there could be a branch to where the Embankment station is now located: it is not clear how a junction would be managed in a pneumatic railway. There were to be three vehicles, one loading at each terminal and one in motion in the tube, so they must have been intended to pass at the terminals. There were to be three classes of accommodation in the coaches.

Work started on 25 October 1865, but less than a year later it was obvious that the capital was grossly inadequate. Authority for extension of time and more capital was obtained, but by then few investors had any confidence that their investment would gain a return. In 1868, a further extension was granted, but little further work was done, and nearly all the money had gone.

In 1881, an independent Waterloo and City Railway was promoted, to build a surface line to Queen Street. The cost was formidable at £2.3 million, and the proposal soon collapsed.

====The Waterloo &amp; City Railway Bill====
In 1891, the Corporation of the City of London made a statistical survey which it published ancillary to the National Census taken in that year. 37,694 persons lived in the City, but the daytime occupation was 310,384. On 4 May 1891, 1,186,094 entries to the City were made, i.e., many people entered more than once. Separate statistical information is that about 50,000 persons arrived at Waterloo daily, of whom about 12,000 proceeded to the City by some means.

In November 1891, a bill was deposited to build an underground electric railway from Waterloo to the Mansion House in the City; the capital was to be £500,000; the proposal was supported by the LSWR but was independent. Three other &quot;tube&quot; railways were proposed in the same parliamentary session, the traditional cut-and-cover method being seen as impractical, as was an elevated railway on viaduct. Electric urban railways had been introduced in Germany in 1891 and in the United States of America, and were in daily, widespread use; but in the United Kingdom, only one example was in existence, the City and South London Railway.

The progress of the bill through Parliament was slow, partly because of the novelty of considering tube railway schemes; there were several petitions from the authorities responsible for public works in the city. London County Council tried to insist that the tubes should be made large enough to carry ordinary trains, and that all trains arriving at Waterloo should continue through them to the City. This idea would have required a new subterranean terminal station at the Bank of at least equal size to Waterloo itself.
Numerous petitions against the bill, or requiring additional protections to be included in it, were presented, but eventually on 27 July 1893, the (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. clxxxvii) gained royal assent.

====Construction====
Following royal assent, the company prepared for construction. The new company issued its prospectus in March 1894 and the subscription list closed on 21 April; 54,000 shares at £10 each were offered and there was a slight over-subscription. A dividend of 3% per annum payable out of capital was promised during the construction phase.

Tenders were acquired for the main tunnel work, and a contract was awarded to John Mowlem &amp; Co for the sum of £229,064 (). The consulting engineers were W. R. Galbraith (of the LSWR) and J. H. Greathead, developer of the tunnelling shield. The resident engineer was H. H. Dalrymple-Hay. Mowlems&#x27; engineer in charge was William Rowell.

Mowlem began work on 18 June 1894, first building staging in the river about west of Blackfriars Bridge. Piles were driven for a cofferdam and two vertical shafts of internal diameter were constructed as headings for the tunnel drive. The average depth of the tunnels is about , with its deepest points at the River Thames, at underground.

Driving the running tunnels started in November 1894, using the Greathead system of shield excavation, cast iron segment lining, compressed air working, and compressed air grouting behind the tunnel lining. Twenty men worked in each heading.

The excavated material was removed from the staging near Blackfriars Bridge; it was conveyed there from the shields by a narrow gauge railway using electric locomotives supplied by the Siemens Company. Two were in use and a third was on order at August 1895. They operated on gauge track with a twin overhead trolley wire (i.e., not using the track for current return) at .

The station works at Waterloo were constructed by Perry and Co. The station tracks run in separate but adjacent arches supporting the main line station, which run transversely to the main line track. The arch piers needed to be underpinned to about lower than the original foundations.

====Civil engineering detail====
The route starts from a point south-east of Waterloo main line station, halfway between Lower Marsh and the now-vanished Aubyn Street, which was destroyed in the station&#x27;s early 20th century expansion and was located more or less where today&#x27;s platforms 3 and 4 are. Leaving towards the north west, the line turns in a curve towards the north east. The curve is constructed by cut-and-cover, and the twin tubes start immediately after it, under Stamford Street, turning north-north-east to pass under the River Thames, converging with Blackfriars Bridge on the north bank. The line turns east there, under Queen Victoria Street, to the station adjacent to the Mansion House, running for part of the way under the District line. The sharpest curves other than those at Waterloo are radius.

The northbound line falls at 1 in 30 for from Waterloo; then the line falls at 1 in 120 and then 1 in 800 to the shaft in the river. The westbound line (considered in reverse to the direction of running) falls at only 1 in 60, and then 1 in 550 to the shaft. From there they run together, level for and then climbing at 1 in 800 for , and then 1 in 88 to the terminus.

The tunnels are internal diameter, except for the curves, where they are . Each long section of tunnel wall was formed with a cast iron ring, made from seven segments and a key piece at the top. bolts connect all the segments. Between each section there was a creosoted timber strip thick, and varying the thickness of this enabled the forward course of the tube to be varied, except in the sharpest curves where the segments were cast to form the curve. There are seven cross-passages between the twin tubes.

Under the Thames the top of the tube is below the bed of the river. The total length of the line is .

The underground station at Waterloo was located within the existing transverse arches of the main line station, with the arrival and departure platforms in separate arches, and a staircase access. Siding accommodation and a reversing siding were provided beyond the platforms: after disembarkation of passengers, an arriving train would continue forward to the reversing sidings, and then return to the departure platform. An additional lay-by siding was provided later.

At the new City station there were two platforms and either could be used by an arriving train, reversing in the platform. The track connections at the approach were a double slip, not a scissors, so a train could not leave while another was arriving. The left hand platform line was extended by a train length and trains could be stabled in the extension. A large diameter Greathead shield was used to bore the section of tunnel where the track connections would be installed.

The tube section for the platform lines at the City station were in diameter, the largest in the world at the time.

====Original signalling====
In late 1897, contracts were let for the signalling equipment; the electric interlocking was to be carried out by W. R. Sykes, who had a call-off contract with the LSWR; a supplement to their standard prices for the tunnel work was agreed.

There were signalboxes at Waterloo at the south end of the northbound platform, and at south end of the northbound platform at City. There were conventional semaphore signals in the open south of Waterloo station, but all other signals were electric lights only. Sykes&#x27; lock-and-block system was used with depression-type treadles. Although there was only one signal section, advance starting signals were provided. The platform starting signals at Waterloo and at City had a lower arm, a &quot;shunt-by signal&quot; which when lowered indicated that the line was clear only to the advance starting signal. The main starting signal when lowered indicated that the line was clear to City.

An electrical traction current interrupt system was installed; a short length of contact bar was provided at each signal, connected to earth when the signal was at danger, and otherwise isolated. A &quot;slipper&quot; contact was fitted on the trains, and if it contacted the contact bar when it was earthed, the traction current was tripped.

====Traction electricity====
On 4 January 1897, a contract was signed with Siemens and Co for the electrical generating and distribution equipment, and the electrical train equipment, for £55,913. Although a German firm, Siemens had a large presence in the UK at the time. There were three lower tenders.

There were five boilers working at driving five (later six) high speed steam engines developing directly coupled to dynamos. The two-pole compound-wound dynamos delivered at no load and under full load; this gave at . Special attention was given to the closeness of the governing to ensure a stable supply voltage. The station lighting circuits were fed from the main switchboard and specially led to maintain lighting supply in the event of a traction current disruption. Station lighting used four lamps in series, with return current via the running rails. (Gas lighting was provided as a back-up.)

There was a short high-level siding within the Waterloo yard area; coal to fuel the boilers was brought in by ordinary LSWR wagons lowered to the running line by the carriage lift; the wagons were drawn through the northbound platform by an electric shunting locomotive, and another lift elevated them to the siding. Boiler ash was disposed of correspondingly.

====City station====
The City station was not originally called Bank. The Central London Railway (CLR, which became the central section of what is now the Central line) obtained an Act of Parliament in 1891 varying their previously-intended route, to take them to the area of the present-day Bank station. The act required them to construct a central station and booking office and public subways connecting the surrounding streets. The subways were to be regarded as public, although maintained by the CLR. Any other railway intending to have a station nearby was entitled to connect to the CLR station by subways. This obviously referred to the Waterloo &amp; City line, and was designed to create a single station frontage in the congested street area. The CLR completed its construction after the W&amp;CR but was obliged to finish the facilities necessary for the earlier opening of the W&amp;CR. The City and South London Railway (CSLR) also operated from the station.

Gillham says:
The W&amp;CR station was located some considerable distance from the area near street level, and this later led to persistent complaints as it required passengers to climb a steep and lengthy gradient to reach the exit.

====Permanent way====
The ordinary LSWR permanent way was used, with rails, but in the tubes longitudinal timbers were used instead of cross-sleepers. The sharp curves had check rails. Cross-bonds paralleling the running rails electrically were provided every and between tracks at the cross passages. The track gauge was the standard .

The conductor rail was a steel inverted channel placed centrally, with its upper surface at the same level as the upper surface of the running rails. At pointwork a hardwood ramp was provided to raise the collector shoes above running rail level.

====Shunting locomotives====
Part of Siemens&#x27;s work under the supply of electrical equipment including a shunting locomotive; this was a four-wheel electric locomotive with a cab at one end only, It had two traction motors and was delivered in 1898. Its main duty was the delivery of the generator station coal. Like the passenger vehicles, its brake system had air reservoirs charged from a static supply at Waterloo. It remained on the system until 1969, when it was transferred to the National Railway Museum at York.

In 1901, a second, more powerful shunting locomotive was acquired. Designed by the LSWR Chief Mechanical Engineer, Dugald Drummond it had two four wheel bogies and was intended for the rescue of failed passenger trains in the tunnel. In 1915, it was removed from the tunnel and put to work shunting coal wagons at Durnsford Road power station, having had its shoe collectors altered for the surface traction supply system.

====The Armstrong Lift====
As the line had no connection to any other line, nor any ground level section, it was necessary to provide a hoist to bring the passenger cars to the line, and to get them out for heavy maintenance. This was provided to the west of the Windsor side of Waterloo main line station, and was known as the &quot;Armstrong&quot; lift, after the manufacturer, Sir W G Armstrong Whitworth &amp; Co Ltd, who was paid £3,560. It was operated by water power; at the time of construction hydraulic power was commonly used in urban areas, supplied by utility companies, to operate hoists and lifts. The lift was to be capable of lifting . It was completed in April 1898. There was a smaller hoist within the low-level siding area at Waterloo for the boiler fuel wagons; this had a smaller travel and was installed by John Abbot &amp; Co for £595.

Before the construction of Waterloo International terminal in 1990, the vehicles were hoisted individually by the Armstrong Lift outside the north wall of Waterloo main line station. The procedure is now carried out using a road-mounted crane in a shaft adjacent to the depot, south of Waterloo main line station on Spur Road. This is only necessary for major maintenance work that requires lifting of the car body, as the Waterloo depot is fully equipped for routine maintenance work. The remaining stub of the siding tunnel that led to the Armstrong Lift can still be seen on the left-hand side of the train shortly after leaving Waterloo for Bank, but the lift itself was buried (along with the entire Western sidings) in 1992 as part of the construction of Waterloo International station.

===The line in operation===

Once works were complete and the Board of Trade inspecting officer passed the line as fit, Prince George, Duke of Cambridge formally opened the line on 11 July 1898. About 400 persons travelled from Waterloo to the City station and immediately back to Waterloo.

Arrangements had been made for the LSWR to work the line, but not everything was in place for immediate opening: there was a delay of four weeks.

The Waterloo &amp; City Railway opened to the public at 8 a.m. on Monday 8 August 1898, with a train leaving each terminal simultaneously. The fares were 2d one class only, payable at a turnstile, but returns and season tickets, and add-ons to surface tickets were available. From 1900, the turnstiles were removed and conductors travelled on the trains, carrying Bell Punch ticket machines. The daily average receipts in January 1899 were £86, and with steadily rising passenger usage and income the Company was able to pay a 3% dividend out of income following the annual general meeting of February 1902. Sunday services were not considered at this period, and in 1906 it was stated that &quot;it would cost £20 each Sunday to run the trains, and they would not get that back in receipts.&quot;

Very soon after operation, it was realised that the line was running to capacity at the business peaks, then referred to as &quot;the rush&quot;, and very lightly used for the remainder of the day. Accordingly, in the spring of 1899 an order was placed with Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. for five new motor cars for single operation. The driving cabs were half width; the traction motors, two per car, were nose suspended with single reduction gear. As with the earlier cars, the air brake reservoir was charged from static equipment at Waterloo. Five of these single cars were delivered in February 1900 and entered service in the spring. From that time, they alone worked the off-peak service, and the original vehicles only worked the peak services.

===Absorption by the LSWR===
The line had been worked by the LSWR from the outset, and in 1906 the LSWR made overtures to the W&amp;CR concerning an outright absorption. It was suggested at an extraordinary general meeting of the W&amp;CR that increasing competition motivated the LSWR. An enabling Act was passed on 20 July 1906 and shareholders&#x27; approval being obtained, the transfer took place on 1 January 1907, with the shareholders receiving LSWR shares, and the W&amp;CR ceased to exist.

In 1915, the LSWR started electrifying its suburban routes, and for the purpose it built a large generating station at Wimbledon, Durnsford Road. The power for train operation on the Waterloo &amp; City line was supplied from this from December 1915, and the original W&amp;CR generating plant now served only ancillary purposes in the line, but also heating and lighting of the main LSWR Waterloo offices. The traction voltage on the W&amp;CR was increased from the original to .

In 1921, it had been considered desirable to augment train lengths at the busy periods, and four new trailer coaches to the original specification were built at Eastleigh; 24 five-car trains were run per hour at the busiest times.

===Southern Railway===
By the Railways Act 1921, the main line railway companies of Great Britain were grouped into four companies, effective at the beginning of 1923. The LSWR was now part of the Southern Railway. Due to the Waterloo &amp; City&#x27;s status as part of one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; railway companies, it was not taken over by the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) at the latter&#x27;s formation in 1933, making the W&amp;C the only tube railway in London not to fall under the control of the LPTB. Despite this anomaly, the line was included on most versions of the Underground map produced by the LPTB and its successors up until the line&#x27;s absorption into the London Underground network in 1994.

In 1934, the LPTB proposed that the Waterloo &amp; City should have a new intermediate station at Blackfriars, connecting with the District line station there. They further proposed that the Waterloo &amp; City line should be extended to Liverpool Street station and Shoreditch, the trains there continuing over the East London Railway to New Cross and New Cross Gate. It is not clear whether the scheme had been costed, but nothing came of it.
==== New rolling stock ====
In 1937, the Southern Railway carried out a thorough review of the technical aspects of the line, now 40 years old. This led to an immediate proposal to order new rolling stock in five-car formations, in association with the provision of escalators at the City station. The scheme was delayed and the declaration of war on 3 September 1939 led to cancellation of the escalator scheme. However, the rolling stock order was proceeded with, and the Art Deco style trains were delivered in 1940, later classified as Class 487.

The original central third rail to power the trains was replaced by a Southern Railway standard steel rail placed outside the running rails. Automatic signalling with train stops was also provided. The City signal box was abolished, and fully automatic working implemented there; the lay-by sidings were abolished. The new stock did not require travelling conductors, and tickets were issued at the terminals. When the line reopened with new trains on 28 October 1940, the City station was renamed &quot;Bank&quot; in conformity with the usage of the LPTB there.

===British Railways===
On 1 January 1948, the Southern Railway, as well as the other main line railways of Great Britain, was nationalised, forming &quot;British Railways&quot;.

On 13 April 1948, a serious accident took place at the Waterloo Armstrong Lift; coal was still taken down to the original generating station which powered station offices at Waterloo. A shunt of wagons was being propelled on to the lift at the upper level; four pawls were supposed to be engaged to provide partial support to the lift table, but it appears that some had not engaged. The table tilted, drawing the wagons and M7 locomotive number 672 on to the table; the table and the entire shunt including the locomotive fell down the shaft. The locomotive and wagons were cut up in situ.
====The Travolator====
When the line was built, the platforms at Bank (then known as &quot;City&quot;) were located a considerable distance from the surface exits, and a long sloping tunnel had to be negotiated on foot. This led to constant complaints and from 1929 there were many proposals to improve the arrangements, as passenger numbers increased, adding congestion to the physical exertion. The proposals had included new escalators, direct connection to adjacent Central London Railway (later Central line) platforms, and new, closer, tunnelled exits.

In the 1950s, a &quot;Speedwalk&quot; system of people movers consisting of a continuous rubber belt system, was implemented in certain American cities. After considerable delay considering this and alternatives, British Railways let a contract on 4 July 1957 for the civil engineering works in driving a new sloping access tunnel, in which a pair of travolators (at the time often written &quot;Trav-O-Lator&quot;) would be installed by Waygood Otis. Otis did not, at this stage, gain a contract.

However, as work was getting under way, the government imposed heavy cuts in capital expenditure on the railways, and after considerable deliberation, it was decided once again to defer alleviation of the problem; no financial benefit was anticipated from the scheme, whereas competing schemes would significantly reduce operational costs. The consulting engineers were directed to suspend work on 11 December 1957, although some enabling work, particularly a sewer diversion, proceeded.

The financial restrictions were not long-lasting, and on 10 July 1958 it was announced that the work would resume. It progressed without further major difficulties and a formal opening by the Lord Mayor of London took place on 27 September 1960, coming into public use immediately. There were two parallel travolators, each with a moving surface having 488 platform sections each ; the whole length is on an inclination of 1 in 7 (about 14.3%). There was a moving handrail. In the morning peak both travolators would operate upwards, with arriving passengers being required to walk down the original ramps; at other times one travolator operated in each direction. The original Otis &quot;Trav-O-Lators&quot; have since been replaced by CNIM machines.

In association with the work, some improvements were made to the station environment at the Waterloo station, and a minute frequency was implemented in the peaks; this involved some minor signalling changes, reversion to alternating platform use at Bank, and the use of turnover drivers and guards (where the arriving driver and guard are replaced by staff waiting at the appropriate place for the change of direction, sometimes referred to as &quot;stepping up&quot;). A &quot;Rear Cab Clear&quot; plunger is provided at Bank so that the arriving driver can confirm that he is clear of the cab and the &quot;step-back&quot; driver can depart when the signal clears. Overall, the work had cost £910,500.

==== Network SouthEast ====
In the mid 1980s, British Rail was split into business sectors, with the line falling under the purview of Network SouthEast (NSE). The line was branded as Waterloo and City, and the elderly Class 487 trains were repainted in the red, blue and white NSE livery. In September 1989, a total route modernisation project was agreed at a cost of £19 million. Both stations would be refurbished in the NSE style, track and signals would be replaced and new rolling stock was ordered.

At the same time as the upgrade project, the Eurostar terminal at Waterloo International was being built over a large area on the north side of Waterloo station. This removed access to the Armstrong Lift that allowed rolling stock and other machinery to access the line, and therefore a replacement shaft near Spur Road was constructed to allow access to Waterloo Depot.

The modernisation project was completed by July 1993, following the delivery of five four-car Class 482 trains. These were built to a modified design from an order for 1992 Stock trains by London Underground for the Central line.

===London Underground===
As part of the privatisation of British Rail, on 1 April 1994 the line was transferred to London Underground Ltd for the sum of £1. At the time, staff were given the option of transferring with the line or remaining in British Rail employment, and all except one chose the latter. The drivers are currently based at Leytonstone. The turquoise line colour was chosen by a lawyer working on the legal transfer of the line to London Underground. From 15 April 1996, the line began working to a new timetable, with three trains departing in each ten minutes during the morning peak.

In January 2003, the Waterloo &amp; City was closed for over three weeks for safety checks after a major derailment on the Central line, which required all 1992 tube stock trains to be modified. That same year, responsibility for the line&#x27;s maintenance was given to the Metronet consortium under the terms of a public–private partnership arrangement.

==== 2006 refurbishment ====
Between April and September 2006, the line was closed for five months for a £40m upgrade by Metronet. The work included refurbishment of the tunnels, platforms and depot, full replacement of the track and signalling, and repainting and refurbishment of the trains. Four new battery-powered locomotives, named &quot;Walter&quot;, &quot;Lou&quot;, &quot;Anne&quot; and &quot;Kitty&quot;, were built by Clayton Equipment in Derby to haul materials and plant along the line during the closure. These works were expected to boost rush-hour capacity by 25% and line capability by 12%. It was also claimed that the average journey would be up to 40 seconds shorter.

During the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics between late July and early September 2012, trains ran on Sundays to cope with the demand for travel in the City.

In the late 2010s, a new entrance at Bank station was constructed at Bloomberg&#x27;s new London headquarters, providing direct access to the line via four new escalators and two lifts – providing step free access to the Waterloo and City line platforms. Although step free access is available at Bank, there is no step free access at Waterloo – and therefore the line does not have step free access.

==== Closure during the COVID-19 pandemic ====
In March 2020, following the UK government&#x27;s implementation of lockdown restricting all non-essential travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Waterloo &amp; City line was suspended. The service remained suspended for 15 months, due to the low level of travel demand on the line, and TfL prioritising the use of train operators on the busier Central line.

TfL stated that they did not expect to reopen the line until demand increased, despite calls from business groups in August 2020 to reopen the line to serve returning office workers. By March 2021, TfL stated that they expected the line to return to operation in May or June 2021, observing that services could be restarted at short notice if required. In May 2021, it was announced that the line would reopen from 21 June 2021. The line reopened ahead of schedule on 4 June 2021, initially operating a peak hour only service on weekday mornings and evenings, before expanding to a full timetable on weekdays in November 2021. It was noted that Saturday services will not be reintroduced for the &quot;foreseeable future&quot;, with TfL stating that ridership on a Saturday pre pandemic was around one-sixth of an average weekday. The line remains closed on Sundays, as previously.

==Rolling stock==
Toward the end of the 1980s, the Class 487 rolling stock fleet built in the 1940s was increasingly unreliable. As part of the total route modernisation project by Network SouthEast (NSE), the decision was taken to purchase new vehicles as an addition to an order for new 1992 Stock trains by London Underground for the Central line. Five 4-car trains were ordered, albeit in Network SouthEast livery and no provision for automatic train operation.

The trains were constructed in 1992–93 and were initially tested and commissioned on the Central line, before being delivered by road to Waterloo depot. Unlike the Class 487 trains, the new trains required a fourth rail traction current system, with a central aluminium negative rail installed as part of the upgrade works to the line.

On 28 May 1993, all of the old rolling stock was withdrawn, the train service being suspended temporarily. A temporary bus service was run while the old rolling stock was physically removed and the new rolling stock brought in. The line reopened on 19 July 1993, with a peak service frequency of minutes. In April 1994, the trains transferred to London Underground following the privatisation of British Rail. Despite this, the trains kept their NSE livery.

In 2006, the 1992 stock trains were overhauled, refurbished and repainted as part of the line upgrade by Metronet. As part of the work, seats were replaced, CCTV was installed, and the original Network SouthEast livery was replaced by the London Underground corporate livery. A 500 tonne crane was required to lift the trains in and out of Waterloo depot, to allow the trains to be transported to Wabtec in Doncaster for the refurbishment work.

Since its introduction, the stock on the Waterloo &amp; City has diverged significantly from that used on the Central line through modifications, including the adoption of automatic train operation on the latter, that the two are no longer interchangeable; the Waterloo &amp; City line continues to use train stops.

=== Future rolling stock ===

In the mid 2010s, TfL began a process of ordering new rolling stock to replace trains on the Piccadilly, Central, Bakerloo and Waterloo &amp; City lines. A feasibility study into the new trains showed that new generation trains and track remodelling at Waterloo could increase capacity on the line by 50%, with 30 trains per hour.

In June 2018, the Siemens Mobility Inspiro design was selected. These trains would have an open gangway design, wider doorways, air conditioning and the ability to run automatically with a new signalling system. TfL could only afford to order Piccadilly line trains at a cost of £1.5bn. However, the contract with Siemens includes an option for 10 trains for the Waterloo &amp; City line in the future. This would take place after the delivery of the Piccadilly line trains in the 2030s.

As part of the financial bailout of TfL in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department for Transport is working with TfL to create a business case for making the line driverless.

=== Historic rolling stock ===

After tendering, a contract for supply of the passenger vehicles was let to the Jackson and Sharp Company of Wilmington, Delaware in the sum of £21,675. The vehicles were to be shipped to Southampton in knock-down kit form, to be assembled at Eastleigh Works by the LSWR.

By 6 January 1898, a skeleton carriage could be run through the tunnels to verify clearances and the first fully assembled train of four carriages was run from Eastleigh to Waterloo on 4 March 1898. The lift for lowering rolling stock to the tunnel level, and some electrical work, were not ready, but on 4 June 1898 a successful trial run was made.

The motor coaches were overall length, and the trailers were , both being wide at floor level and high from rail level. There were 11 of each type, to run in four four-car formations with spares.

The accommodation was of the open saloon type, then a novelty in Britain; there were gate entrances at the end of the vehicles. The trailers seated 56 persons, and the motor coaches seated 46, with a raised section over the motor bogie.

The traction motors by Siemens were series-wound gearless motors on the axles. The trains ran in a formation of four cars, the two outer vehicles being motor coaches. The motor cars were constructed to allow an early form of multiple unit operation and the front car&#x27;s controller was additionally able to control the rear car&#x27;s motors. The two motors at each end were connected in series at starting, then reconnected in parallel (using open circuit transition) as the train accelerated in the well established (at that time) method. This required eight cables to be run the length of the train at roof level. A further cable making nine in all linked the collector shoes at opposite ends of the four-car set to avoid problems with the large gaps in the centrally mounted conductor rail.

There was a crew of six at first: driver, driver&#x27;s assistant, guard and three gatemen; the driver&#x27;s assistant was subsequently no longer required. The trains used Westinghouse brakes, and the air reservoirs were charged from static compressors at Waterloo. They were charged to , running down to before needing to be recharged. Lighting was run from the power circuit, with four lamps in series from the nominal.

====New trains ordered by the Southern Railway====

In the late 1930s, new rolling stock was ordered by the Southern Railway. Despite the declaration of war in September 1939, the work was considered well advanced, and 12 motor coaches and 16 trailers were ordered from English Electric, and built at the Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. works at Preston. The Art Deco style trains were delivered through 1940, and the old cars were removed from the line on 25 October 1940, the new cars starting work on 28 October, with the line closed over the intervening weekend.

Constructed of welded steel, trains were run in five-car formations, Motor coach + trailer + trailer + trailer + motor coach, with spares for overhaul. The motor coaches had cabs at each end, enabling single-car operation by them; they had two axle-hung traction motors rated at for one hour. The new trains had on-board compressors for the air brakes, and interior lights were in two circuits, one fed from the motor car at one end of the unit, and one from the other, avoiding total lighting loss in passing conductor rail gaps. The conductor rail was altered to the outside position normal for the third-rail system. There was no train power line, and each motor coach collected its own electric supply.

==Extension proposals==
There have been proposals to extend the Waterloo &amp; City line for over a century. After acquiring the Great Northern &amp; City Railway (GN&amp;C) in 1913 (the current Northern City Line), the Metropolitan Railway considered proposals to join the GN&amp;C to the Waterloo &amp; City or to the Circle line, but these never came to fruition. Any extension of the line north would be difficult because of the complex web of tube lines around Bank, and an extension south would be unlikely to provide demand that matched the cost. The narrow tunnels and short train lengths of the current route make any extension less cost-effective than larger projects such as Crossrail 2, which cost more but start with modern tunnels and promise far greater benefits.

The London Plan Working Party Report of 1949 envisaged as its Route G the electrification of the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend Railway (LTS), and its diversion away from Fenchurch Street to Bank and on through the Waterloo &amp; City tunnels to Waterloo and its suburban lines. The Waterloo &amp; City tunnels would have had to be bored out to main line size to enable this, at prohibitive cost. In the event, only the electrification of the LTS took place, though the Docklands Light Railway tunnel from Minories to the Bank follows part of the envisaged route.

The revised Working Party Report of 1965 did not mention the Route G proposal, though it does conclude that &quot;[t]he possibility of extending the Waterloo &amp; City line northwards to Liverpool Street has been examined, but found to be physically impracticable.&quot; 

Around 2009, the Green Party revived the Metropolitan&#x27;s plan of connecting the Northern City and Waterloo &amp; City lines as a Crossrail route.

== Map and stations ==


== In popular culture ==
The Waterloo and City line is closed on weekends; as a result, it has become a well-established and convenient location for film companies. When it was owned by British Rail and its predecessors, it could be used when London Transport were unable or unwilling to allow access to their own stations or lines.
* The film &quot;The Long Memory&quot; (1953) contains a suicide attempt on the railway.
* It can be also seen in the Norman Wisdom film &quot;On the Beat&quot; (1962), where filming took place on 12 August 1961.
* Scenes for a murder in the film &quot;The Liquidator&quot; (1965) were recorded at Bank station.
* The second series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Survivors&quot; was filmed on the line, representing various parts of the Central and Northern lines.
* In the television adaptation of &quot;The Tripods&quot; (1984), Waterloo masquerades as Porte de la Chapelle station on the Paris Métro.
* Waterloo was also used in the Peter Howitt film &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; (1998), portraying Embankment and one other unknown District line station.

==Other details==
The remnants of one of the Greathead tunnelling shields used in the construction of the line can be seen in the interchange tunnel at Bank connecting the Waterloo and City line platforms with those of the Northern line and the Docklands Light Railway. It is painted red.

The Waterloo &amp; City line is colloquially known as &quot;The Drain&quot;, and it was given the Engineer&#x27;s Line Reference code &#x27;DRN&#x27; by British Rail. The origins of this nickname seem to be uncertain; it may be due to the tunnels beneath the Thames continually leaking and the resulting water needing to be pumped out, or perhaps because passenger access to the platforms at Bank was by a lengthy sloping subway resembling a drain.

Uniquely among London&#x27;s Underground lines, virtually all infrastructure on the Waterloo &amp; City line is completely underground, including all track, both stations, and the maintenance depot at Waterloo. (The Victoria line is also underground for the entire passenger route and all stations, but has a surface level, open-air depot for maintenance.) There are no track connections with any other railway line; all equipment transfers to and from the line are accomplished from the shaft and road crane at the Waterloo depot.

<text>Robert Craig Knievel (October 17, 1938November 30, 2007), known professionally as Evel Knievel (), was an American stunt performer and entertainer. Throughout his career, he attempted more than 75 ramp-to-ramp motorcycle jumps. Knievel was inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1999.

Evel Knievel was born in Butte, Montana. Raised by his paternal grandparents, Knievel was inspired to become a motorcycle daredevil after attending a Joie Chitwood auto daredevil show. He left high school early to work in the copper mines but was later fired for causing a city-wide power outage. After adopting the nickname &quot;Evel Knievel&quot;, he participated in rodeos and ski jumping events, and served in the U.S. Army before marrying Linda Joan Bork and starting a semi-pro hockey team. To support his family, Knievel started the Sur-Kill Guide Service and later worked as an insurance salesman. Eventually, he opened a Honda motorcycle dealership in Washington, but faced difficulties promoting Japanese imports. After the dealership closed, Knievel worked at a motorcycle shop where he learned motocross stunts that would later contribute to his daredevil career.

Knievel&#x27;s most famous stunt was an attempt to jump the fountains at Caesars Palace, which resulted in severe injuries. Despite never successfully jumping the Grand Canyon, Knievel became a legendary figure, breaking numerous records and bones throughout his career.

On September 8, 1974, Knievel attempted to jump across the Snake River Canyon in Idaho using a rocket-powered cycle called the Skycycle X-2. The jump failed after the parachute deployed prematurely, but Knievel survived with minor injuries.

Knievel sought to profit from his image through endorsements and marketing deals. American Eagle Motorcycles signed him, and his popularity grew with young boys. From 1972 to 1977, Ideal Toy Company sold over $125 million worth of Knievel toys. Knievel&#x27;s fame led to TV appearances and partnerships with companies like AMF and Harley-Davidson. However, after an assault conviction and jail time, he lost endorsements and declared bankruptcy. Despite a decline in his daredevil career, Knievel made a marketing comeback in the 1990s and continued to be involved in various ventures.

Knievel died on November 30, 2007, at the age of 69 due to diabetes and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He was buried in his hometown of Butte, Montana. Posthumously, Knievel has been honored through various exhibits, a museum, and tribute jumps. His legacy also lives on in television commercials featuring his iconic stunts.

== Early life ==

Knievel was born on October 17, 1938, in Butte, Montana, the first of two children of Robert E. and Ann Marie Keough Knievel. His surname is of German origin; his paternal great-great-grandparents immigrated to the United States from Germany. His mother was of Irish ancestry. Robert and Ann divorced in 1940, after the 1939 birth of their second child, Nicolas, known as Nic. Both parents decided to leave Butte.

Knievel and his brother were raised in Butte by their paternal grandparents, Ignatius and Emma Knievel. At the age of eight, Knievel attended a Joie Chitwood auto daredevil show, which he credited for his later career choice as a motorcycle daredevil.

Knievel was a cousin of Democratic U.S. Representative from Montana, Pat Williams (b. 1937).

Knievel left Butte High School after his sophomore year. He got a job in the copper mines as a diamond drill operator with the Anaconda Mining Company; however, Knievel preferred motorbiking to what he called &quot;unimportant stuff&quot;. He was promoted to surface duty, where he drove a large earth mover. Knievel was fired when he made the earth mover do a motorcycle-type wheelie and accidentally drove it into Butte&#x27;s main power line, leaving the city without electricity for several hours.

Knievel&#x27;s website says that he chose his nickname after spending a night in jail in 1956 after being arrested for reckless driving. In the same jail that night was a man named William Knofel, who had the nickname “Awful Knofel”; this led to Knievel being referred to as “Evel Knievel”.

Seeking new thrills and challenges, Knievel participated in local professional rodeos and ski jumping events, including winning the Northern Rocky Mountain Ski Association Class A Men&#x27;s ski jumping championship in 1959. During the late 1950s, Knievel joined the United States Army. His athletic ability allowed him to join the track team, where he was a pole vaulter. After his army stint, Knievel returned to Butte, where he met and married his first wife, Linda Joan Bork. Shortly after getting married, Knievel started the Butte Bombers, a semi-pro hockey team.

To help promote his team and earn some money, he convinced the Czechoslovakian Olympic ice hockey team to play the Butte Bombers in a warm-up game to the 1960 Winter Olympics (to be held in California). Knievel was ejected from the game minutes into the third period and left the stadium. When the Czechoslovakian officials went to the box office to collect the expense money that the team was promised, workers discovered the game receipts had been stolen. The United States Olympic Committee ended up paying the Czechoslovakian team&#x27;s expenses to avoid an international incident. Knievel tried out with the Charlotte Clippers of the Eastern Hockey League in 1959, but decided that a traveling team was not for him.

After the birth of his first son, Kelly, Knievel realized that he needed to come up with a new way to support his family financially. Using the hunting and fishing skills taught to him by his grandfather, Knievel started the Sur-Kill Guide Service. He guaranteed that if a hunter employed his service and paid his fee, he would get the big game animal desired or Knievel would refund his fee.

Knievel, after learning about the culling of elk in Yellowstone, decided to hitchhike from Butte to Washington, D.C., in December 1961 to raise awareness and to have the elk relocated to areas where hunting was permitted. After this conspicuous trek (he hitchhiked with a rack of elk antlers and a petition with 3,000 signatures), he presented his case to Representative Arnold Olsen, Senator Mike Mansfield, and Interior Secretary Stewart Udall. Culling was stopped in the late 1960s.

After returning home to the west from Washington, D.C., he joined the motocross circuit and had moderate success, but he still could not make enough money to support his family. In 1962, Knievel broke his collarbone and shoulder in a motocross accident. The doctors said he could not race for at least six months. Still needing to help support his family, he again switched careers and sold insurance for the Combined Insurance Company of America, working for W. Clement Stone. Stone suggested that Knievel read &quot;Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude&quot;, a book that Stone wrote with Napoleon Hill. Knievel credited much of his later success to Stone and his book.

Knievel was successful as an insurance salesman, but felt that his efforts were being unrecognized. When the company refused to promote him to vice president after he had been a few months on the job, he quit. Wanting a new start away from Butte, Knievel moved his family to Moses Lake, Washington. There, he opened a Honda motorcycle dealership and promoted motocross racing. During the early 1960s, he and other dealers had difficulty promoting and selling Japanese imports because of the steep competition of their auto industry, and the Moses Lake Honda dealership eventually closed. After the closure, Knievel went to work for Don Pomeroy at his motorcycle shop in Sunnyside, Washington. Pomeroy&#x27;s son, Jim Pomeroy, who went on to compete in the Motocross World Championship, taught Knievel how to do a &quot;wheelie&quot; and ride while standing on the seat of the bike.

== Career ==

=== Stunt performance ===

As a boy, Knievel had seen the Joie Chitwood show. He decided that he could do something similar using a motorcycle. Promoting the show himself, Knievel rented the venue, wrote the press releases, set up the show, sold the tickets, and served as his own master of ceremonies. After enticing the small crowd with a few wheelies, he proceeded to jump a box of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions. Despite landing short and his back wheel hitting the box containing the rattlesnakes, Knievel managed to land safely.

Knievel realized that to make a more substantial amount of money he would need to hire more performers, stunt coordinators, and other personnel so that he could concentrate on the jumps. With little money, he went looking for a sponsor and found one in Bob Blair, owner of ZDS Motors, Inc., the West Coast distributor for Berliner Motor Corporation, a distributor for Norton Motorcycles. Blair offered to provide the needed motorcycles, but he wanted the name changed from &quot;Bobby Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils Thrill Show&quot; to &quot;Evil Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils&quot;. Knievel did not want his image to be that of a Hells Angels rider, so he convinced Blair to at least allow him to use the spelling &quot;Evel&quot; instead of &quot;Evil&quot;.

Knievel and his daredevils debuted on January 3, 1966, at the National Date Festival in Indio, California. The second booking was in Hemet, California, but was canceled due to rain. The next performance was on February 10, in Barstow, California. During the performance, Knievel attempted a new stunt in which he would jump, spread-eagled, over a speeding motorcycle. Knievel jumped too late and the motorcycle hit him in the groin, tossing him into the air. He was hospitalized as a result of his injuries. When released, he returned to Barstow to finish the performance he had started almost a month earlier.

Knievel&#x27;s daredevil show broke up after the Barstow performance because injuries prevented him from performing. After recovering, Knievel started traveling from small town to small town as a solo act. To get ahead of other motorcycle stunt people who were jumping animals or pools of water, Knievel started jumping cars. He began adding more and more cars to his jumps when he would return to the same venue to get people to come out and see him again. Knievel had not had a serious injury since the Barstow performance, but on June 19 in Missoula, Montana, he attempted to jump twelve cars and a cargo van. The distance he had for takeoff did not allow him to get up enough speed. His back wheel hit the top of the van while his front wheel hit the top of the landing ramp. Knievel ended up with a severely broken arm and several broken ribs. The crash and subsequent stay in the hospital were a publicity windfall.

With each successful jump, the public wanted him to jump one more car. On March 25, 1967, Knievel cleared 15 cars at Ascot Park in Gardena, California. Then he attempted the same jump on July 28, 1967, in Graham, Washington, where he had his next serious crash. Landing his cycle on the last vehicle, a panel truck, Knievel was thrown from his bike. This time he suffered a serious concussion. After a month, he recovered and returned to Graham on August 18 to finish the show; but the result was the same, only this time the injuries were more serious. Again coming up short, Knievel crashed, breaking his left wrist, right knee, and two ribs.

Knievel first received national exposure on March 18, 1968, when comedian and late-night talk show host Joey Bishop had him on as a guest of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;.

==== Caesars Palace ====

While in Las Vegas to watch Dick Tiger successfully defend his World Boxing Association (WBA) and World Boxing Council (WBC) light heavyweight titles at the Convention Center on November 17, 1967, Knievel first saw the fountains at Caesars Palace and decided to jump them.

To get an audience with casino CEO Jay Sarno, Knievel created a fictitious corporation called Evel Knievel Enterprises and three fictitious lawyers to make phone calls to Sarno. Knievel also placed phone calls to Sarno claiming to be from American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; inquiring about the jump. Sarno finally agreed to meet Knievel and arranged for Knievel to jump the fountains on December 31, 1967, New Year&#x27;s Eve. After the deal was set, Knievel tried to get ABC to air the event live on their popular &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;. ABC declined but said that if Knievel had the jump filmed and it was as spectacular as he said it would be, they would consider using it later.

Knievel, at the age of 29, used his own money to have actor/director John Derek produce a film of the Caesars jump. To keep costs low, Derek employed his then-wife Linda Evans as one of the camera operators. It was Evans who filmed the famous landing. On the morning of the jump, Knievel stopped in the casino and placed his last $100 on the blackjack table (which he lost), stopped by the bar, and had a shot of Wild Turkey, and then headed outside where he was joined by several members of the Caesars staff, as well as two showgirls.

After doing his normal pre-jump show and a few warm-up approaches, Knievel began his real approach. When he hit the takeoff ramp, he said later, he felt the motorcycle unexpectedly decelerate. The sudden loss of power on the takeoff caused Knievel to come up short and land on the safety ramp which was supported by a van. This caused the handlebars to be ripped out of his hands as he tumbled over them onto the pavement where he skidded into the Dunes hotel parking lot.

As a result of the crash, Knievel suffered a crushed pelvis and femur, fractures to his hip, wrist, and both ankles, and a concussion that kept him in the hospital. Rumors circulated that he was in a coma for 29 days in the hospital, but this was refuted by his wife and others in the documentary film &quot;Being Evel&quot;.

The Caesars Palace crash was Knievel&#x27;s longest attempted motorcycle jump at . After his crash and recovery, Knievel was more famous than ever. ABC declined to air the event live on &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;. The Caesars Palace historical jump video is now owned by K and K Promotions, Inc which is the successor in interest and owner of all Evel Knievel trademarks, film footage, and copyrights.

==== Insurance ====

In a 1971 interview with Dick Cavett, Knievel stated that he was uninsurable following the Caesars&#x27; crash, stating, &quot;I have trouble getting life insurance, accident insurance, hospitalization and even insurance for my automobile... Lloyd&#x27;s of London has rejected me 37 times so if you hear the rumor that they insure anybody, don&#x27;t pay too much attention to it.&quot; Four years later, a clause in Knievel&#x27;s contract to jump 14 buses at Kings Island required a one-day $1million liability insurance to the amusement park. Lloyd&#x27;s of London offered liability insurance for $17,500. Knievel eventually paid $2,500 to a U.S.-based insurance company.

==== Jumps and records ====

To keep his name in the news, Knievel proposed his biggest stunt ever, a motorcycle jump across the Grand Canyon. Just five months after his near-fatal crash in Las Vegas, Knievel performed another jump. On May 25, 1968, in Scottsdale, Arizona, Knievel crashed while attempting to jump 15 Ford Mustangs. Knievel ended up breaking his right leg and foot as a result of the crash.

On August 3, 1968, Knievel returned to jumping, making more money than ever before. He was earning approximately $25,000 per performance, and he was making successful jumps almost weekly until October 13, in Carson City, Nevada. While trying to stick the landing, he lost control of the bike and crashed, breaking his hip again.

By 1971, Knievel realized that the U.S. government would never allow him to jump the Grand Canyon. To keep his fans interested, Knievel considered several other stunts that might match the publicity that would have been generated by jumping the canyon. Ideas included jumping across the Mississippi River, jumping from one skyscraper to another in New York City, and jumping over 13 cars inside the Houston Astrodome. While flying back to Butte from a performance tour, he looked out the window of his airplane and saw the Snake River Canyon. After finding a location just east of Twin Falls, Idaho, that was wide enough, deep enough, and on private property, he leased for $35,000 to stage his jump. He set the date for Labor Day (September 4), 1972.

On January 78, 1971, Knievel set a sales record at the Houston Astrodome by selling over 100,000 tickets to back-to-back performances there. On February 28, he set a new world record by jumping 19 cars with his Harley-Davidson XR-750 at the Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California. The 19-car jump was shot for the biopic &quot;Evel Knievel.&quot; Knievel held the record for 27 years until Bubba Blackwell jumped 20 cars in 1998 with an XR-750. In 2015, Doug Danger surpassed that number with 22 cars, accomplishing this feat on Evel Knievel&#x27;s actual vintage 1972 Harley-Davidson XR-750.

On May 10, 1970, Knievel crashed while attempting to jump 13 Pepsi delivery trucks in Yakima, WA. His approach was complicated by the fact that he had to start on pavement, cut across grass, and then return to pavement. His lack of speed caused the motorcycle to come down on its front wheel first. He managed to hold on until the cycle hit the base of the ramp. After being thrown off, he skidded for . He broke his collarbone, suffered a compound fracture of his right arm, and broke both legs.

On March 3, 1972, at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California, after making a successful jump, he tried to come to a quick stop because of a short landing area. He reportedly suffered a broken back and a concussion after getting thrown off and run over by his motorcycle, a Harley-Davidson. Knievel returned to jumping in November 1973, when he successfully jumped over 50 stacked cars at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. For 35 years, Knievel held the record for jumping the most stacked cars on a Harley-Davidson XR-750 (the record was broken in October 2008). His historic XR-750 is now part of the collection of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History. Made of steel, aluminum, and fiberglass, the customized motorcycle weighs about .

During his career, Knievel may have suffered more than 433 bone fractures, earning an entry in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the survivor of &quot;most bones broken in a lifetime&quot;. However, this number could be exaggerated: his son Robbie told a reporter in June 2014 that his father had broken 40 to 50 bones; Knievel himself claimed he broke 35.

==== The Grand Canyon jump ====

Although Knievel never attempted to jump the Grand Canyon, rumors of the Canyon jump were started by Knievel himself in 1968, following the Caesars Palace crash. During a 1968 interview, Knievel stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if they say, &#x27;Look, kid, you&#x27;re going to drive that thing off the edge of the Canyon and die,&#x27; I&#x27;m going to do it. I want to be the first. If they&#x27;d let me go to the moon, I&#x27;d crawl all the way to Cape Kennedy just to do it. I&#x27;d like to go to the moon, but I don&#x27;t want to be the second man to go there.&quot; For the next several years, Knievel negotiated with the federal government to secure a jumping site and develop various concept bikes to make the jump, but the Interior Department denied him airspace over the northern Arizona canyon. Knievel switched his attention in 1971 to the Snake River Canyon in southern Idaho.

In the 1971 film &quot;Evel Knievel&quot;, George Hamilton (as Knievel) alludes to the canyon jump in the final scene of the movie. One of the common movie posters for the film depicts Knievel jumping his motorcycle off a (likely) Grand Canyon cliff. In 1999, his son Robbie jumped a portion of the Grand Canyon owned by the Hualapai Indian Reservation.

==== Snake River Canyon jump ====


&quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot; was unwilling to pay the price Knievel wanted for the Snake River Canyon jump, so he hired boxing promoter Bob Arum&#x27;s company, Top Rank Productions, to put the event on closed-circuit television and broadcast to movie Investors in the event took a substantial loss, including promoter DonE. Branker, as well as Vince McMahon of what was then called the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Arum partnered with Invest West Sports, Shelly Saltman&#x27;s company, to secure from Invest West Sports two things: first, the necessary financing for the jump, and second, the services of Saltman, long recognized as one of America&#x27;s premier public relations and promotion men, to do publicity so that Knievel could concentrate on his jumps. Knievel hired aeronautical engineer Doug Malewicki to build him a rocket-powered cycle to jump across the Snake River, and called it the Skycycle X-1. Malewicki&#x27;s creation was powered by a steam engine built by former Aerojet engineer Robert Truax. On April 15, 1972, the X-1 was launched to test the feasibility of the launching ramp. The decision was then made to have Truax build two Skycycle X-2s, one to test and one for the actual jump. Both the X-1 and the X-2 test vehicles went into the river.

The launch took place at the south rim of the Snake River Canyon, west of Shoshone Falls, on September 8, 1974, at 3:36 p.m. MDT. The steam that powered the engine was superheated to a temperature of . The drogue parachute prematurely deployed as the Skycycle left the launching rail and induced significant drag. Even though the craft made it across the canyon to the north rim, the prevailing northwest winds caused it to drift back into the canyon. By the time it hit the bottom of the canyon, it landed only a few feet from the water on the same side of the canyon from which it had been launched. If he had landed in the water, Knievel said that he would have drowned, due to a harness malfunction that kept him strapped in the vehicle. He survived the failed jump with only minor physical injuries.

Since the 1974 launch, seven daredevils have expressed interest in recreating the jump, including Knievel&#x27;s two sons, Robbie and Kelly. In 2010, Robbie announced he would recreate the jump. Stuntman Eddie Braun announced he was working with Kelly and Robert Truax&#x27;s son to recreate the jump using a replica of the Skycycle X-2. Braun&#x27;s jump took place on September 16, 2016, and was completed successfully.

==== Wembley jump ====

After the Snake River jump, Knievel returned to motorcycle jumping with &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot; televising several jumps. On May 26, 1975, in front of 90,000 people at Wembley Stadium in London, Knievel crashed while trying to land a jump over 13 redundant single-deck AEC Merlin buses (the term &quot;London Buses&quot; used in earlier publicity had led to the belief that the attempt was to be made over the higher and more traditional AEC Routemaster double-decker type).

After the crash, despite breaking his pelvis, Knievel addressed the audience and announced his retirement by stating, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen of this wonderful country, I&#x27;ve got to tell you that you are the last people in the world who will ever see me jump. Because I will never, ever, ever jump again. I&#x27;m through.&quot; Near shock and ignoring Frank Gifford&#x27;s (of &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot;) plea to use a stretcher, Knievel walked off the Wembley pitch stating, &quot;I came in walking, I went out walking!&quot;

==== Kings Island jump ====

After recuperating, Knievel decided that he had spoken too soon and that he would continue jumping. On October 25, 1975, Knievel jumped 14 Greyhound buses at Kings Island near Cincinnati, Ohio. Although Knievel landed on the safety deck above the 14th bus, his landing was successful and he held the record for jumping the most buses on a Harley-Davidson for 24 years (until broken by Bubba Blackwell in late 1999 with 15 at ). The Kings Island event scored the highest viewer ratings in the history of &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot; and would serve as Knievel&#x27;s longest successful jump at (although the Caesars Palace jump was longer, it ended in a crash). In the end, Knievel was featured in seven of the ten highest-rated episodes of &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot;. After the Kings Island jump, Knievel again announced his retirement.

His retirement was once again short-lived, and Knievel continued to jump. However, after the lengthy Kings Island jump, Knievel limited the remainder of his career jumps to shorter and more attainable lengths. Knievel jumped on October 31, 1976, at the Seattle Kingdome. He jumped only seven Greyhound buses but it was a success. Despite the crowd&#x27;s pleasure, Knievel felt that it was not his best jump, and apologized to the crowd.

==== Shark jump ====

On January 31, 1977, Knievel was scheduled for a major jump in Chicago, Illinois. The jump was inspired by the 1975 film &quot;Jaws&quot;. Knievel was scheduled to jump a tank full of live sharks which would be televised live nationally. However, during his rehearsal, Knievel lost control of the motorcycle and crashed into a cameraman. Although Knievel broke his arms, he was more distraught over what he claimed was a permanent eye injury to cameraman Thomas Geren. The cameraman was admitted to the hospital and received treatment for an injury near his eye, but received no permanent injury. The footage of this crash was so upsetting to Knievel that he did not show the clip for 19 years until the documentary &quot;Absolute Evel: The Evel Knievel Story&quot;.

Later that year on the sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;, motorcycle-riding character Fonzie (Henry Winkler) performed a similar trick, albeit on waterskis, inspiring the creation of the phrase &quot;jump the shark.&quot;

Afterward, Knievel retired from major performances and limited his appearances to smaller venues to help launch Robbie&#x27;s career. His last stunt show, not including a jump, took place in March 1980 in Puerto Rico. However, Knievel would officially finish his career as a daredevil as a touring &quot;companion&quot; of Robbie&#x27;s, limiting his performance to speaking only, rather than stunt riding. His final tour appearance with Robbie was in March 1981 in Hollywood, Florida.

=== Feature movies: &quot;Evel Knievel&quot; and &quot;Viva Knievel!&quot;===
A 1971 biopic film, &quot;Evel Knievel&quot;, fictionalized Knievel&#x27;s life and exploits. Knievel, portrayed by George Hamilton, calls himself &quot;the last gladiator in the new Rome&quot;; this was a nod to a January 1970 Esquire magazine article about the stunt rider, whose author, David Lyle, declared, &quot;Evel Knievel [...] may be the last great gladiator.&quot; (Later, Knievel titled his 1988 self-produced documentary &quot;Last of the Gladiators&quot;.) A higher end B-movie, &quot;Evel Knievel&quot; was a minor hit, taking in $4 million in rentals (equivalent to approximately $ in ) against a $450,000 budget.

Knievel played himself in the 1977 American action film &quot;Viva Knievel&quot;, directed by Gordon Douglas and co-starring Gene Kelly and Lauren Hutton, with an ensemble supporting cast including Red Buttons, Leslie Nielsen, Cameron Mitchell, Frank Gifford, Dabney Coleman and Marjoe Gortner. The film premiered in June 1977, three months later Knievel and his associates attacked promoter Shelly Saltman with an aluminum baseball bat on September 21, 1977.

With Knievel losing most of his sponsorship and marketing deals as a result of the bad publicity, &quot;Viva Knievel&quot; became much less commercially attractive, only opening in four further international markets after Knievel&#x27;s conviction. In addition, the wholesome image of Knievel the movie promoted and the plot point concerning Knievel&#x27;s promoter being corrupt seemed ill-judged in the light of the events that saw Knievel imprisoned.

=== Motorcycles ===

Knievel briefly used a Honda 250cc motorcycle to jump a crate of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions, his first known jump. Knievel then used a Norton Motorcycle Company 750cc for only one year, 1966. Between 1967 and 1968, Knievel jumped using the Triumph Bonneville T120 (with a 650cc engine). Knievel used the Triumph at the Caesars Palace crash on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1967. When Knievel returned to jumping after the crash, he used Triumph for the remainder of 1968.

Attempting his jumps on motorcycles whose suspensions were designed primarily for street riding or flat track racing was a major factor in Knievel&#x27;s many disastrous landings. The terrific forces these machines passed on to his body are well illustrated in the super slow-motion footage of his Caesars&#x27; landing.

Between December 1969 and April 1970, Knievel used the Laverda American Eagle 750cc motorcycle. On December 12, 1970, Knievel would switch to the Harley-Davidson XR-750, the motorcycle with which he is best known for jumping. Knievel would use the XR-750 in association with Harley-Davidson until 1977. However, after his 1977 conviction for the assault of Shelly Saltman, Harley-Davidson withdrew its sponsorship of Knievel.

On September 8, 1974, Knievel attempted to jump the Snake River Canyon on a rocket-propelled motorcycle designed by former NASA engineer Robert Truax, dubbed the Skycycle X-2. The State of Idaho registered the X-2 as an airplane rather than a motorcycle.

At the tail end of his career, while helping launch the career of his son, Robbie, Knievel returned to the Triumph T120. However, he used the bike only for wheelies and did not jump after retiring from the XR-750.

In 1997, Knievel signed with the California Motorcycle Company to release a limited &quot;Evel Knievel Motorcycle.&quot; The motorcycle was not built to jump but was rather a V-twin cruiser motorcycle intended to compete with Harley-Davidson street bikes. Knievel promoted the motorcycle at his various public appearances. After the company closed in 2003, Knievel returned to riding modern street Harley-Davidson motorcycles at his public appearances.

Robbie sold limited-edition motorcycles from his company, Knievel Motorcycles Manufacturing Inc. Although two of the motorcycles refer to Evel (the Legend Series Evel Commemorative and the Snake River Canyon motorcycle), Evel did not ride Robbie&#x27;s bikes.

=== Leather jumpsuits ===

Throughout his daredevil career, Knievel was known for his leather jumpsuits that were compared to the jumpsuits worn by Elvis Presley. When Knievel began jumping, he used a black and yellow jumpsuit. When he switched to the Triumph motorcycle, his jumpsuit changed to a white suit with stripes down the legs and sleeves. In interviews, he said the reason for the switch was because he saw how Liberace had become not just a performer, but the epitome of what a showman should be, and Knievel sought to create his variation of that showmanship in his jumps. Two variations of the white suit appeared (one with three stars across the chest and one with the three stars on his right chest). The latter was worn at the Caesars Palace jump.

When Knievel switched to the Laverda motorcycle in 1969, he switched his leathers to an All American Themed red-white-and-blue jumpsuit with an &quot;X&quot; across the chest. Later, Knievel adjusted the blue stripes to a V-shape (the first version of the V-shape was also used in the 1971 film&#x27;s final jump). For the remainder of his career, variants of the V-shaped white-starred jumpsuit would be a constant, including a special nylon/canvas flight suit that matched his white leathers for the X-2 jump. Each variant would become more elaborate, including the addition of the red-white-blue cape and the Elvis-styled belt buckle with his initials, &quot;EK&quot;. In 1975, Knievel premiered the blue leathers with red stars on the white stripes for the Wembley jump.

=== Core values ===

Evel Knievel took great pride in his core values. Throughout his career and later life, he would repeatedly talk about the importance of &quot;keeping his word&quot;. He stated that, although he knew he might not successfully make a jump or even survive the canyon jump, he followed through with each stunt because he gave his word that he would. Before the canyon jump, Knievel stated, &quot;If someone says to you, &#x27;that guy should have never jumped the canyon. You knew if he did, that he&#x27;d lose his life and that he was crazy.&#x27; Do me a favor. Tell him that you saw me here and regardless of what I was, that you knew me, and that I kept my word.&quot;

In &quot;Last of the Gladiators&quot;, Knievel discussed the crash of a 1970 Pepsi-Cola sponsored jump in Yakima, Washington. Knievel knew the jump was very questionable, but stated, &quot;I went ahead and did it anyway. When you give your word to somebody that you&#x27;re going to do something, you&#x27;ve gotta do it.&quot; In the 1971 biopic, George Hamilton (as Knievel) emphasizes in the opening monologue that a man does not go back on his word.

==== Anti-drug campaign ====

Knievel would regularly share his anti-drug message, one of his core values. Knievel would preach an anti-drug message to children and adults before each of his stunts.

Knievel regularly spoke out against the Hells Angels due to their alleged involvement in the drug trade. A near-riot erupted during Knievel&#x27;s show at the Cow Palace on March 3, 1971, when a Hells Angels member threw a metal object (either a tire iron or a Coca-Cola can, according to different witnesses) at Knievel. Knievel and a majority of the spectators fought back, injuring three of the fifteen Hells Angels members in attendance to the point that they required hospitalization.

In the film &quot;Viva Knievel!&quot;, Knievel plays a fictionalized version of himself who foils a drug lord&#x27;s attempt to smuggle narcotics into the United States.

==== Motorcycle helmet safety ====

Knievel was a proponent of motorcycle helmet safety. He constantly encouraged his fans to wear motorcycle helmets. The Bell Star helmet he used in the Caesars Palace jump is credited for having saved Knievel&#x27;s life after he fell off the motorcycle and struck his head on the ground. (Following the Caesars Palace crash, each of Knievel&#x27;s full-face helmets bore the slogan, &quot;Color Me Lucky.&quot;) Knievel once offered a cash reward for anyone who witnessed him stunting on a motorcycle without a helmet.

In 1987, Knievel supported a mandatory helmet bill in the State of California. During the Assembly Transportation Committee meeting, Knievel was introduced as &quot;the best walking commercial for a helmet law.&quot; Evel claimed the main reason he was still alive and walking was that he wore a helmet.

=== Marketing image ===

Knievel sought to make more money from his image. He was no longer satisfied with just receiving free motorcycles to jump with. Knievel wanted to be paid to use and promote a company&#x27;s brand of motorcycles. After Triumph, the British motorcycle brand he had been jumping with, refused to meet his demands (it was part of the bankrupt BSA group that was merged with Norton in 1972), Knievel started to propose the idea to other manufacturers. &quot;American Eagle Motorcycles&quot;, the brand under which Italian Laverda machines were sold in the US, was the first company to sign Knievel to an endorsement deal. Knievel then used the new lightweight racing motorcycle Harley-Davidson XR-750 from December 1970 until his final jump in January 1977.

At approximately the same time, Fanfare Films started production on the George Hamilton biopic (Evel Knievel (1971 film)). Two other films about Knievel, a television pilot made in 1974 starring Sam Elliott, and a made-for-TV film in 2004 starring George Eads, were produced in later years. In 1974, Knievel and Amherst Records released at the Sound City Studios the self-titled album &quot;Evel Knievel&quot;, which included a press conference, an anti-drug talk for his young fans, and four other tracks.
In 1972, Knievel appeared in the motorcycle safety film &#x27;Not So Easy&#x27;, together with &quot;Easy Rider&quot; Peter Fonda.

Knievel kept up his pursuit of the United States government to allow him to jump the Grand Canyon. To push his case, he hired famed San Francisco defense attorney Melvin Belli to fight the legal battle for obtaining government permission. &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot; started showing Knievel&#x27;s jumps on television regularly. His popularity, especially with young boys, was ever-increasing. He became a hero to a generation of young boys. A. J. Foyt made Knievel part of his pit crew for the Indianapolis 500 in 1970. Evel Knievel&#x27;s huge fame caused him to start traveling with bodyguards, who became life-long friends.

==== Ideal Toys ====

Between 1972 and 1977, Ideal Toy Company released a series of Evel Knievel-related merchandise, designed initially by Joseph M. Burck of Marvin Glass and Associates. During the six years the toys were manufactured, Ideal claimed to have sold more than $125million worth of Knievel toys. The toys included the original 1972 figures, which offered various outfits and accessories. In 1973, Ideal released the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle. After the release of the Stunt Cycle, the Knievel toys were the best-selling item for Ideal.

During the next four years, Ideal Toys released various models relating to Knievel&#x27;s touring stunt show. The models included a Robbie Knievel doll, the Scramble Van, The Canyon Sky Cycle, a Dragster, a Stunt Car, and the Evel Knievel The Stunt World. Additionally, Ideal released non-Knievel-touring toys, including a Chopper Motorcycle, a Trail Bike, and a female counterpart, Derry Daring. The last item marketed by Ideal Toys before it discontinued the distribution of Knievel toys was the Strato-Cycle, based on the film &quot;Viva Knievel!&quot;

In 1977, Bally marketed its Knievel pinball machine as the &quot;first fully electronic commercial game&quot;; it has elsewhere been described as one of the &quot;last of the classic pre-digital games.&quot; (Both electromechanical and solid-state versions were produced. The electromechanical version is extremely rare, with only 155 made.)

==== Other television appearances ====

In the 1970s, Knievel partnered with AMF to release a series of bicycles, marketed with TV ads.

Though Knievel had no involvement, a 30-minute ABC Saturday morning animated series &quot;Devlin&quot; produced by Hanna-Barbera aired in the fall of 1974. The series, inspired by his popularity, featured stunt motorcyclists.

Knievel made several television appearances, including frequently as a guest on talk shows such as &quot;Dinah!&quot; and Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;. In 1977, he made a guest spot on &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, where he played himself, getting inadvertently caught up in East German espionage while appearing in West Germany. Actual footage from Evel&#x27;s L.A. Coliseum jump over crushed cars was used at the beginning of the episode, and an indoor jump over eleven cars and one van was used at the end of the show. Also in 1977, Warner Bros. released &quot;Viva Knievel!&quot; This movie starred Knievel as himself and co-starred Gene Kelly, Lauren Hutton, and Red Buttons. Similar to &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, actual Wembley footage was used in the film. In addition, the 1999 children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Hilltop Hospital&quot; featured a character based on Knievel called Weasel Kneasel, who was the focus of an episode of the same name. In Disney/Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, a character named Duke Caboom (voiced by Keanu Reeves) was partially based on the Evel Knievel toy. On September 23, 2020, Knievel&#x27;s son Kelly and K&amp;K Promotions filed a lawsuit against Disney and Pixar, claiming Duke was created illegally using Knievel&#x27;s likeness.

==== Assault conviction, jail, and bankruptcy ====
While Knievel was healing from injuries sustained from the Chicago jump, the book &quot;Evel Knievel on Tour&quot; was released. Written by Knievel&#x27;s promoter for the Snake River Canyon jump, Shelly Saltman, the book painted him as &quot;an alcoholic, a pill addict, an anti-Semite and an immoral person&quot; through tape-recorded interviews done of Knievel and others.

Knievel, with both arms still in casts, flew to California to confront Saltman, by then a vice president at 20th Century Fox. On September 21, 1977, outside the studio commissary, one of Knievel&#x27;s friends grabbed Saltman and held him, while Knievel attacked him with an aluminum baseball bat, declaring &quot;I&#x27;m going to kill you!&quot; According to a witness to the attack, Knievel struck repeated blows at Saltman&#x27;s head, with Saltman blocking the blows with his left arm. Saltman&#x27;s arm and wrist were shattered in several places before he fell to the ground unconscious. Numerous surgeries were done to the shattered arm that resulted in Saltman having a steel plate and screws.

Saltman&#x27;s book was withdrawn by the publisher after Knievel threatened to sue. Saltman later produced documents in both criminal and civil court that proved that, although Knievel claimed to have been insulted by statements in Saltman&#x27;s book, he and his lawyers had been given editorial access to the book and had approved and signed off on every word before its publication. On November 15, 1977, Knievel pleaded guilty to battery and was sentenced to three years probation and six months in county jail.

After the Saltman assault and subsequent jail time, Knievel lost his marketing endorsements and deals, including Harley-Davidson and Ideal Toys. With no income from jumping or sponsorships, Knievel eventually declared bankruptcy. In 1981, Saltman was awarded a $12.75million judgment against Knievel in a civil trial, but he never received any money from either Knievel or Knievel&#x27;s estate. Knievel expressed no remorse for the attack, once calling it &quot;frontier justice&quot;.

=== Marriages and children ===

Knievel was married twice. He and his wife Linda were married for 38 years. During their marriage, the couple had four children: two boys, Kelly and Robbie, and two girls, Tracey and Alicia. Throughout Kelly&#x27;s and Robbie&#x27;s adolescence, they performed at Knievel&#x27;s stunt shows. Into adulthood, Robbie continued to perform as a professional motorcycle daredevil. After Evel&#x27;s death, Kelly has overseen the Knievel legacy, including developing Knievel-related products and assisting Harley-Davidson to develop a museum exhibit. Knievel&#x27;s courtship and marriage to Linda was the theme of the biopic 1971 film &quot;Evel Knievel&quot;. Linda and Evel separated in the early 1990s and were divorced in 1997 in San Jose, California. 

A municipal judge ordered Evel to stand trial for a weapons possession charge in 1994. Knievel was arrested in October at a Sunnyvale go-go bar on suspicion of battering his girlfriend, 25-year-old Krystal Kennedy of Florida. Sunnyvale police later discovered two handguns and some ammunition in the trunk of his car. The battering charge was dropped when Kennedy declined to cooperate.

In 1999, Knievel married his girlfriend, Krystal Kennedy of Clearwater, Florida, whom he began dating in 1992. The wedding was held on November 19, 1999, on a special platform built on the fountains at Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip (site of Evel&#x27;s jump New Year&#x27;s Eve 1967). Long-time friend Engelbert Humperdinck sent a recorded tribute to the couple.

The couple was married for two years, divorcing in 2001. Following the divorce, Krystal Knievel was granted a restraining order against him. However, Krystal and Evel would work out their differences, living together until Knievel&#x27;s death. According to the investment magazine, &quot;Registered Rep&quot;., Knievel left his entire estate to Krystal.

=== Post-daredevil years ===

During the 1980s, Knievel drove around the country in a recreational vehicle, selling works of art allegedly painted by him. After several years of obscurity, Knievel made a significant marketing comeback in the 1990s, representing Maxim Casino, Little Caesars, Harley-Davidson and other firms.

In 1999, Knievel celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Snake River Canyon jump at the Twin Falls mall. His memorabilia was then stored at Kent Knigge&#x27;s farm in Filer, Idaho, seven miles west of Twin Falls. During the same year, Knievel was inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame.

Knievel once dreamed of housing all of his career memorabilia in an Evel Knievel Museum to be located in his home state of Montana. Those dreams were unfulfilled, and his artifacts are spread throughout transportation museums and private collections around the world. Knievel&#x27;s original blueprints and handwritten notes about his desired museum are currently displayed at the Route 66 Vintage Iron Motorcycle Museum in downtown Miami, Oklahoma. The Route 66 site also houses Evel&#x27;s Snake River Canyon Jump Mission Control Super Van. While Knievel&#x27;s original dream of having all his significant memorabilia being centralized would go unfulfilled, a few public museums were opened in his honor, including the Evel Knievel Museum in Topeka, Kansas, which has the official approval of the Knievel estate.

On October 9, 2005, Knievel promoted his last public &quot;motorcycle ride&quot; at the Milwaukee Harley-Davidson dealership. The ride was to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina. Although he was originally scheduled to lead a benefit ride through Milwaukee, Knievel never rode the motorcycle because he suffered a mild (non-debilitating) stroke before the appearance and limited his visit to a signing session.

==== &quot;Evel Knievel: The Rock Opera&quot; ====

In 2003, Knievel signed over exclusive rights to Los Angeles composer Jef Bek, authorizing the production of a rock opera based on Knievel&#x27;s life. Directed by &quot;Bat Boy&quot; co-creator Keythe Farley, the production opened in Los Angeles in September 2007 to some positive reviews.

==== Six Flags Evel Knievel roller coaster ====
Knievel had partnered with Six Flags St. Louis to name a new wooden coaster after &quot;America&#x27;s Legendary Daredevil&quot;. The amusement park in Eureka, Missouri, outside of St. Louis, Missouri, opened the ride on June 20, 2008. &quot;The Evel Knievel Roller Coaster&quot; operated for three seasons before being renamed &quot;American Thunder&quot; in 2011.

==== Declining health ====

In the late 1990s, Knievel required a life-saving liver transplant as a result of suffering the long-term effects of Hepatitis C, which he contracted from one of the numerous blood transfusions he received before 1992. In February 1999, Knievel was given only a few days to live and he requested to leave the hospital and die at his home. En route to his home, Knievel received a phone call from the hospital stating a young man had died in a motorcycle accident and could be a donor. Days later, Knievel received the transplant.

In 2005, he was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, an incurable and terminal lung disease that required him to be on supplemental oxygen 24 hours a day. In 2006, he had an internal morphine pain pump surgically implanted to help him with the excruciating pain in his deteriorated lower back, one of the costs of incurring so many traumas throughout his career as a daredevil. He also had two strokes after 2005, but neither left him with severe debilitation.

On July 27, 2006, he appeared on &quot;The Adam Carolla Show&quot; and discussed his health problems. The following day, he appeared on stage with Robbie at &quot;Evel Knievel Days&quot; in Butte, marking the last performance in which the two appeared together. Robbie jumped in a tribute to his father on a much lighter motorcycle with far superior suspension.

Shortly before his death, Evel Knievel was featured in a BBC Two Christmas special presented by Richard Hammond. The 60-minute program &quot;Richard Hammond Meets Evel Knievel&quot; aired on December 23, 2007, less than a month after Knievel&#x27;s death. The documentary was filmed in July 2007 at the annual &quot;Evel Knievel Days&quot; festival in his old hometown of Butte.

==== Christian conversion ====

On April 1, 2007, Knievel appeared on Robert H. Schuller&#x27;s television program &quot;Hour of Power&quot; and announced that he &quot;believed in Jesus Christ&quot; for the first time. At his request, he was baptized at a televised congregation at the Crystal Cathedral by Schuller. Knievel&#x27;s televised testimony triggered mass baptisms at the Crystal Cathedral.

== Death ==

Knievel died in Clearwater, Florida on November 30, 2007, aged 69. He had been suffering from diabetes and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for many years. A longtime friend reported that Knievel had trouble breathing while at his residence in Clearwater and died on the way to hospital. The friend said, &quot;It&#x27;s been coming for years but you just don&#x27;t expect it. Superman just doesn&#x27;t die, right?&quot;

In one of his last interviews, Knievel told &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine:

Knievel was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in his hometown of Butte, Montana on December 10, 2007, following a funeral at the 7,500-seat Butte Civic Center presided over by Robert H. Schuller with actor Matthew McConaughey giving the eulogy. Before the Monday service, fireworks exploded in the Butte night sky as pallbearers carried Knievel&#x27;s casket into the center.

== Posthumous recognition ==

On July 10, 2010, a special temporary exhibit entitled &quot;True Evel: The Amazing Story of Evel Knievel&quot; was opened at the Harley-Davidson Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The exhibit was opened in collaboration with Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and Evel&#x27;s oldest son, Kelly. Among the various artifacts from Knievel&#x27;s life, the exhibit included his &quot;Shark Jump&quot; Harley-Davidson XR-750, the Skycycle X-2, a blue jumpsuit from late in his career without any sponsor patches, and his trademark red-white-and-blue jumpsuit complete with his helmet and walking stick. Evel Knievel merchandising, personal artifacts, and X-rays from his injuries were also exhibited. In December 2010, a traveling version of the exhibit began a one-year tour of the United Kingdom and Europe.

On September 16, 2016, professional stuntman Eddie Braun successfully jumped the Snake River Canyon in a replica of Knievel&#x27;s Snake River rocket. Braun cited Knievel as an inspiration and wanted to show that Knievel&#x27;s jump would have been successful had the parachute not been deployed too early. Braun stated that he was &quot;finishing out [the] dream&quot; of his hero, Knievel.

In 2017, the Evel Knievel Museum, a museum honoring Knievel was opened in Topeka, Kansas, by co-founders Lathan McKay and Mike Patterson. The museum features his motorcycles, leathers, helmets, wardrobe, and jewelry along with various displays and a virtual reality motorcycle jump.

On July 8, 2018, Travis Pastrana from Nitro Circus paid tribute to Evel on History Channel live event, &quot;Evel Live&quot;, with 3 of Evel&#x27;s most famous record-breaking Las Vegas jumps in one night. He was riding a Roland Sands Design–prepared 450-pound Indian Scout FTR750, and dressed in a full Evel Knievel getup, down to wearing vintage-style-appearing dress boots from Bates, the manufacturer that had made Evel&#x27;s.

On November 16, 2023, the New York Times crossword, created by Paolo Pascal, paid homage to Knievel with a themed crossword which included clues such as &quot;Description of this puzzle&#x27;s subject&quot; (&quot;DAREDEVIL&quot;) and &quot;Acting dangerously, like this puzzle&#x27;s subject&quot; (&quot;LIVING ON THE EDGE&quot;). Upon completion of the puzzle through the NYT Games app or website, solvers were rewarded with a short animation of a person on a motorcycle leaping through the squares of the crossword over three buses.

On December 19th, 2024, news broke of a biographical film adaptation of Evel&#x27;s life being in the works. La La Land director Damien Chazelle was attached to direct, with William Monahan set to pen the script and Leonardo DiCaprio set to star as Knievel.

=== Television commercials ===

In November 2010, General Motors premiered a television commercial featuring footage of Knievel&#x27;s Wembley Stadium crash in 1975, followed by Knievel getting onto his feet. The ad focused on GM&#x27;s restructuring and emphasized the belief that &quot;we all fall down&quot;.

On July 18, 2012, Audi of America recreated Knievel&#x27;s Snake River jump in a promotional commercial for the Audi RS5. The commercial depicts the RS5 being driven by a professional driver and jumping the canyon off a jump ramp.

<text>Acmeism, or the Guild of Poets, was a modernist transient poetic school, which emerged or in 1912 in Russia under the leadership of Nikolay Gumilev and Sergei Gorodetsky. Their ideals were compactness of form and clarity of expression. The term was coined after the Greek word (&quot;akmē&quot;), i.e., &quot;the best age of man&quot;.

The acmeist mood was first announced by Mikhail Kuzmin in his 1910 essay &quot;Concerning Beautiful Clarity&quot;. The acmeists contrasted the ideal of Apollonian clarity (hence the name of their journal, &quot;Apollon&quot;) to &quot;Dionysian frenzy&quot; propagated by the Russian symbolist poets like Bely and Vyacheslav Ivanov. To the Symbolists&#x27; preoccupation with &quot;intimations through symbols&quot; they preferred &quot;direct expression through images&quot;.

In his later manifesto &quot;The Morning of Acmeism&quot; (1913), Osip Mandelstam defined the movement as &quot;a yearning for world culture&quot;. As a &quot;neo-classical form of modernism&quot;, which essentialized &quot;poetic craft and cultural continuity&quot;, the Guild of Poets placed Alexander Pope, Théophile Gautier, Rudyard Kipling, Innokentiy Annensky, and the Parnassian poets among their predecessors.

Major poets in this school include Osip Mandelstam, Nikolay Gumilev, Mikhail Kuzmin, Anna Akhmatova, and Georgiy Ivanov. The group originally met in The Stray Dog Cafe, St. Petersburg, then a celebrated meeting place for artists and writers. Mandelstam&#x27;s collection of poems &quot;Stone&quot; (1912) is considered the movement&#x27;s finest accomplishment.

Amongst the major acmeist poets, each interpreted acmeism in a different stylistic light, from Akhmatova&#x27;s intimate poems on topics of love and relationships to Gumilev&#x27;s narrative verse.

<doc id="66432" wikidata="Q26963" url="?curid=66432" title="Progesterone">
<text>Progesterone (; P4) is an endogenous steroid and progestogen sex hormone involved in the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and embryogenesis of humans and other species. It belongs to a group of steroid hormones called the progestogens and is the major progestogen in the body. Progesterone has a variety of important functions in the body. It is also a crucial metabolic intermediate in the production of other endogenous steroids, including the sex hormones and the corticosteroids, and plays an important role in brain function as a neurosteroid.

In addition to its role as a natural hormone, progesterone is also used as a medication, such as in combination with estrogen for contraception, to reduce the risk of uterine or cervical cancer, in hormone replacement therapy, and in feminizing hormone therapy. It was first prescribed in 1934.
==Biological activity==

Progesterone is the most important progestogen in the body. As a potent agonist of the nuclear progesterone receptor (nPR) (with an affinity of KD = 1 nM) the resulting effects on ribosomal transcription plays a major role in regulation of female reproduction. In addition, progesterone is an agonist of the more recently discovered membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs), of which the expression has regulation effects in reproduction function (oocyte maturation, labor, and sperm motility) and cancer although additional research is required to further define the roles. It also functions as a ligand of the PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) which impacts tumor progression, metabolic regulation, and viability control of nerve cells. Moreover, progesterone is also known to be an antagonist of the sigma σ1 receptor, a negative allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and a potent antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Progesterone prevents MR activation by binding to this receptor with an affinity exceeding even those of aldosterone and glucocorticoids such as cortisol and corticosterone, and produces antimineralocorticoid effects, such as natriuresis, at physiological concentrations. In addition, progesterone binds to and behaves as a partial agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), albeit with very low potency (EC50 &gt;100-fold less relative to cortisol).

Progesterone, through its neurosteroid active metabolites such as 5α-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone, acts indirectly as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor.

Progesterone and some of its metabolites, such as 5β-dihydroprogesterone, are agonists of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), albeit weakly so (EC50 &gt;10 μM). In accordance, progesterone induces several hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP3A4, especially during pregnancy when concentrations are much higher than usual. Perimenopausal women have been found to have greater CYP3A4 activity relative to men and postmenopausal women, and it has been inferred that this may be due to the higher progesterone levels present in perimenopausal women.

Progesterone modulates the activity of CatSper (cation channels of sperm) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Since eggs release progesterone, sperm may use progesterone as a homing signal to swim toward eggs (chemotaxis). As a result, it has been suggested that substances that block the progesterone binding site on CatSper channels could potentially be used in male contraception.

==Biological function==
===Hormonal interactions===
Progesterone has a number of physiological effects that are amplified in the presence of estrogens. Estrogens through estrogen receptors (ERs) induce or upregulate the expression of the PR. One example of this is in breast tissue, where estrogens allow progesterone to mediate lobuloalveolar development.

Elevated levels of progesterone potently reduce the sodium-retaining activity of aldosterone, resulting in natriuresis and a reduction in extracellular fluid volume. Progesterone withdrawal, on the other hand, is associated with a temporary increase in sodium retention (reduced natriuresis, with an increase in extracellular fluid volume) due to the compensatory increase in aldosterone production, which combats the blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor by the previously elevated level of progesterone.

===Early sexual differentiation===
Progesterone plays a role in early human sexual differentiation. Placental progesterone is the feedstock for the 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) produced via the backdoor pathway found operating in multiple non-gonadal tissues of the fetus, whereas deficiencies in this pathway lead to undervirilization of the male fetus, resulting in incomplete development of the male genitalia. DHT is a potent androgen that is responsible for the development of male genitalia, including the penis and scrotum.

During early fetal development, the undifferentiated gonads can develop into either testes or ovaries. The presence of the Y chromosome leads to the development of testes. The testes then produce testosterone, which is converted to DHT via the enzyme 5α-reductase. DHT is a potent androgen that is responsible for the masculinization of the external genitalia and the development of the prostate gland. Progesterone, produced by the placenta during pregnancy, plays a role in fetal sexual differentiation by serving as a precursor molecule for the synthesis of DHT via the backdoor pathway. In the absence of adequate levels of steroidogenic enzymes during fetal development, the backdoor pathway for DHT synthesis can become deficient, leading to undermasculinization of the male fetus. This can result in the development of ambiguous genitalia or even female genitalia in some cases. Therefore, both DHT and progesterone play crucial roles in early fetal sexual differentiation, with progesterone acting as a precursor molecule for DHT synthesis and DHT promoting the development of male genitalia.

===Reproductive system===

Progesterone has key effects via non-genomic signalling on human sperm as they migrate through the female reproductive tract before fertilization occurs, though the receptor(s) as yet remain unidentified. Detailed characterisation of the events occurring in sperm in response to progesterone has elucidated certain events including intracellular calcium transients and maintained changes, slow calcium oscillations, now thought to possibly regulate motility. It is produced by the ovaries. Progesterone has also been shown to demonstrate effects on octopus spermatozoa.

Progesterone is sometimes called the &quot;hormone of pregnancy&quot;, and it has many roles relating to the development of the fetus:
* Progesterone converts the endometrium to its secretory stage to prepare the uterus for implantation. At the same time progesterone affects the vaginal epithelium and cervical mucus, making it thick and impenetrable to sperm. Progesterone is anti-mitogenic in endometrial epithelial cells, and as such, mitigates the tropic effects of estrogen. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels will decrease, leading to menstruation. Normal menstrual bleeding is progesterone-withdrawal bleeding. If ovulation does not occur and the corpus luteum does not develop, levels of progesterone may be low, leading to anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding.
* During implantation and gestation, progesterone appears to decrease the maternal immune response to allow for the acceptance of the pregnancy.
* Progesterone decreases contractility of the uterine smooth muscle. This effect contributes to prevention of preterm labor. Studies have shown that in individuals who are pregnant with a single fetus, asymptomatic in the prenatal stage, and at a high risk of giving pre-term birth spontaneously, vaginal progesterone medication has been found to be effective in preventing spontaneous pre-term birth. Individuals who are at a high risk of giving pre-term birth spontaneously are those who have a short cervix of less than 25 mm or have previously given pre-term birth spontaneously. Although pre-term births are generally considered to be less than 37 weeks, these studies found that vaginal progesterone is associated with fewer pre-term births of less than 34 weeks.
* A drop in progesterone levels is possibly one step that facilitates the onset of labor.
* In addition, progesterone inhibits lactation during pregnancy. The fall in progesterone levels following delivery is one of the triggers for milk production.

The fetus metabolizes placental progesterone in the production of adrenal steroids.

===Breasts===
====Lobuloalveolar development====
Progesterone plays an important role in breast development. In conjunction with prolactin, it mediates lobuloalveolar maturation of the mammary glands during pregnancy to allow for milk production and thus lactation and breastfeeding of offspring following parturition (childbirth). Estrogen induces expression of the PR in breast tissue and hence progesterone is dependent on estrogen to mediate lobuloalveolar development. It has been found that is a critical downstream mediator of progesterone-induced lobuloalveolar maturation. RANKL knockout mice show an almost identical mammary phenotype to PR knockout mice, including normal mammary ductal development but complete failure of the development of lobuloalveolar structures.

====Ductal development====
Though to a far lesser extent than estrogen, which is the major mediator of mammary ductal development (via the ERα), progesterone may be involved in ductal development of the mammary glands to some extent as well. PR knockout mice or mice treated with the PR antagonist mifepristone show delayed although otherwise normal mammary ductal development at puberty. In addition, mice modified to have overexpression of PRA display ductal hyperplasia, and progesterone induces ductal growth in the mouse mammary gland. Progesterone mediates ductal development mainly via induction of the expression of amphiregulin, the same growth factor that estrogen primarily induces the expression of to mediate ductal development. These animal findings suggest that, while not essential for full mammary ductal development, progesterone seems to play a potentiating or accelerating role in estrogen-mediated mammary ductal development.

====Breast cancer risk====
Progesterone also appears to be involved in the pathophysiology of breast cancer, though its role, and whether it is a promoter or inhibitor of breast cancer risk, has not been fully elucidated. Most progestins, or synthetic progestogens, like medroxyprogesterone acetate, have been found to increase the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal people in combination with estrogen as a component of menopausal hormone therapy. The combination of natural oral progesterone or the atypical progestin dydrogesterone with estrogen has been associated with less risk of breast cancer than progestins plus estrogen. However, this may simply be an artifact of the low progesterone levels produced with oral progesterone. More research is needed on the role of progesterone in breast cancer.

===Skin health===
The estrogen receptor, as well as the progesterone receptor, have been detected in the skin, including in keratinocytes and fibroblasts. At menopause and thereafter, decreased levels of female sex hormones result in atrophy, thinning, and increased wrinkling of the skin and a reduction in skin elasticity, firmness, and strength. These skin changes constitute an acceleration in skin aging and are the result of decreased collagen content, irregularities in the morphology of epidermal skin cells, decreased ground substance between skin fibers, and reduced capillaries and blood flow. The skin also becomes more dry during menopause, which is due to reduced skin hydration and surface lipids (sebum production). Along with chronological aging and photoaging, estrogen deficiency in menopause is one of the three main factors that predominantly influences skin aging.

Hormone replacement therapy, consisting of systemic treatment with estrogen alone or in combination with a progestogen, has well-documented and considerable beneficial effects on the skin of postmenopausal people. These benefits include increased skin collagen content, skin thickness and elasticity, and skin hydration and surface lipids. Topical estrogen has been found to have similar beneficial effects on the skin. In addition, a study has found that topical 2% progesterone cream significantly increases skin elasticity and firmness and observably decreases wrinkles in peri- and postmenopausal people. Skin hydration and surface lipids, on the other hand, did not significantly change with topical progesterone.

These findings suggest that progesterone, like estrogen, also has beneficial effects on the skin, and may be independently protective against skin aging.

===Sexuality===

====Libido====

Progesterone and its neurosteroid active metabolite allopregnanolone appear to be importantly involved in libido in females.

====Homosexuality====
Dr. Diana Fleischman, of the University of Portsmouth, and colleagues looked for a relationship between progesterone and sexual attitudes in 92 women. Their research, published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior found that women who had higher levels of progesterone scored higher on a questionnaire measuring homoerotic motivation. They also found that men who had high levels of progesterone were more likely to have higher homoerotic motivation scores after affiliative priming compared to men with low levels of progesterone.

===Nervous system===
Progesterone, like pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), belongs to an important group of endogenous steroids called neurosteroids. It can be metabolized within all parts of the central nervous system.

Neurosteroids are neuromodulators, and are neuroprotective, neurogenic, and regulate neurotransmission and myelination. The effects of progesterone as a neurosteroid are mediated predominantly through its interactions with non-nuclear PRs, namely the mPRs and PGRMC1, as well as certain other receptors, such as the σ1 and nACh receptors.

===Brain damage===
Previous studies have shown that progesterone supports the normal development of neurons in the brain, and that the hormone has a protective effect on damaged brain tissue. It has been observed in animal models that females have reduced susceptibility to traumatic brain injury and this protective effect has been hypothesized to be caused by increased circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone in females.

====Proposed mechanism====
The mechanism of progesterone protective effects may be the reduction of inflammation that follows brain trauma and hemorrhage.

Damage incurred by traumatic brain injury is believed to be caused in part by mass depolarization leading to excitotoxicity. One way in which progesterone helps to alleviate some of this excitotoxicity is by blocking the voltage-dependent calcium channels that trigger neurotransmitter release. It does so by manipulating the signaling pathways of transcription factors involved in this release. Another method for reducing the excitotoxicity is by up-regulating the GABAA, a widespread inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor.

Progesterone has also been shown to prevent apoptosis in neurons, a common consequence of brain injury. It does so by inhibiting enzymes involved in the apoptosis pathway specifically concerning the mitochondria, such as activated caspase 3 and cytochrome c.

Not only does progesterone help prevent further damage, it has also been shown to aid in neuroregeneration. One of the serious effects of traumatic brain injury includes edema. Animal studies show that progesterone treatment leads to a decrease in edema levels by increasing the concentration of macrophages and microglia sent to the injured tissue. This was observed in the form of reduced leakage from the blood brain barrier in secondary recovery in progesterone treated rats. In addition, progesterone was observed to have antioxidant properties, reducing the concentration of oxygen free radicals faster than without. There is also evidence that the addition of progesterone can also help remyelinate damaged axons due to trauma, restoring some lost neural signal conduction. Another way progesterone aids in regeneration includes increasing the circulation of endothelial progenitor cells in the brain. This helps new vasculature to grow around scar tissue which helps repair the area of insult.

===Addiction===

Progesterone enhances the function of serotonin receptors in the brain, so an excess or deficit of progesterone has the potential to result in significant neurochemical issues. This provides an explanation for why some people resort to substances that enhance serotonin activity such as nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis when their progesterone levels fall below optimal levels.
* Sex differences in hormone levels may induce women to respond differently than men to nicotine. When women undergo cyclic changes or different hormonal transition phases (menopause, pregnancy, adolescence), there are changes in their progesterone levels. Therefore, females have an increased biological vulnerability to nicotine&#x27;s reinforcing effects compared to males and progesterone may be used to counter this enhanced vulnerability. This information supports the idea that progesterone can affect behavior.
* Similar to nicotine, cocaine also increases the release of dopamine in the brain. The neurotransmitter is involved in the reward center and is one of the main neurotransmitters involved with substance abuse and reliance. In a study of cocaine users, it was reported that progesterone reduced craving and the feeling of being stimulated by cocaine. Thus, progesterone was suggested as an agent that decreases cocaine craving by reducing the dopaminergic properties of the drug.

===Societal===
In a 2012 University of Amsterdam study of 120 women, women&#x27;s luteal phase (higher levels of progesterone, and increasing levels of estrogen) was correlated with a lower level of competitive behavior in gambling and math contest scenarios, while their premenstrual phase (sharply-decreasing levels of progesterone, and decreasing levels of estrogen) was correlated with a higher level of competitive behavior.

===Other effects===
* Progesterone also has a role in skin elasticity and bone strength, in respiration, in nerve tissue and in female sexuality, and the presence of progesterone receptors in certain muscle and fat tissue may hint at a role in sexually dimorphic proportions of those.
* During pregnancy, progesterone is said to decrease uterine irritability.
* During pregnancy, progesterone helps to suppress immune responses of the mother to fetal antigens, which prevents rejection of the fetus.
* Progesterone raises epidermal growth factor-1 (EGF-1) levels, a factor often used to induce proliferation, and used to sustain cultures, of stem cells.
* Progesterone increases core temperature (thermogenic function) during ovulation.
* Progesterone reduces spasm and relaxes smooth muscle. Bronchi are widened and mucus regulated. (PRs are widely present in submucosal tissue.)
* Progesterone acts as an antiinflammatory agent and regulates the immune response.
* Progesterone reduces gall-bladder activity.
* Progesterone normalizes blood clotting and vascular tone, zinc and copper levels, cell oxygen levels, and use of fat stores for energy.
* Progesterone may affect gum health, increasing risk of gingivitis (gum inflammation).
* Progesterone appears to prevent endometrial cancer (involving the uterine lining) by regulating the effects of estrogen.
* Progesterone plays an important role in the signaling of insulin release and pancreatic function, and may affect the susceptibility to diabetes or gestational diabetes.
* Progesterone levels in the blood were found to be lower in those who had higher weight and higher BMI among those who became pregnant through in vitro fertilization.
* Current data shows that micronized progesterone, which is chemically identical to the progesterone produced in people&#x27;s bodies, in combination with estrogen in menopausal hormone therapy does not seem to have significant effects on venous thromboembolism (blood clots in veins) and ischemic stroke (lack of blood flow to the brain due to blockage of a blood vessel that supplies the brain). However, more studies need to be conducted to see whether or not micronized progesterone alone or in combined menopausal hormone therapy changes the risk of myocardial infarctions (heart attacks).
* There have not been any studies done yet on the effects of micronized progesterone on hair loss due to menopause.
* Despite suggestions for using hormone therapy to prevent loss of muscle mass in post-menopausal individuals (50 and older), menopausal hormone therapy involving either estrogen alone or estrogen and progesterone has not been found to preserve muscle mass. Menopausal hormone therapy also does not result in body weight reduction, BMI reduction, or change in glucose metabolism.

==Biochemistry==

===Biosynthesis===
In mammals, progesterone, like all other steroid hormones, is synthesized from pregnenolone, which itself is derived from cholesterol.

Cholesterol undergoes double oxidation to produce 22&quot;R&quot;-hydroxycholesterol and then 20α,22&quot;R&quot;-dihydroxycholesterol. This vicinal diol is then further oxidized with loss of the side chain starting at position C22 to produce pregnenolone. This reaction is catalyzed by cytochrome P450scc.

The conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone takes place in two steps. First, the 3β-hydroxyl group is oxidized to a keto group and second, the double bond is moved to C4, from C5 through a keto/enol tautomerization reaction. This reaction is catalyzed by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/δ5-4-isomerase.

Progesterone in turn is the precursor of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone, and after conversion to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, of cortisol and androstenedione. Androstenedione can be converted to testosterone, estrone, and estradiol, highlighting the critical role of progesterone in testosterone synthesis.

Pregnenolone and progesterone can also be synthesized by yeast.

Approximately 25 mg of progesterone is secreted from the ovaries per day, while the adrenal glands produce about 2 mg of progesterone per day.

===Distribution===
Progesterone binds extensively to plasma proteins, including albumin (50–54%) and transcortin (43–48%). It has similar affinity for albumin relative to the PR.

===Metabolism===
The metabolism of progesterone is rapid and extensive and occurs mainly in the liver, though enzymes that metabolize progesterone are also expressed widely in the brain, skin, and various other tissues. Progesterone has an elimination half-life of only approximately 5 minutes in circulation. The metabolism of progesterone is complex, and it may form as many as 35 different unconjugated metabolites when it is ingested orally. Progesterone is highly susceptible to enzymatic reduction via reductases and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases due to its double bond (between the C4 and C5 positions) and its two ketones (at the C3 and C20 positions).

The major metabolic pathway of progesterone is reduction by 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase into the dihydrogenated 5α-dihydroprogesterone and 5β-dihydroprogesterone, respectively. This is followed by the further reduction of these metabolites via 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into the tetrahydrogenated allopregnanolone, pregnanolone, isopregnanolone, and epipregnanolone. Subsequently, 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase reduce these metabolites to form the corresponding hexahydrogenated pregnanediols (eight different isomers in total), which are then conjugated via glucuronidation and/or sulfation, released from the liver into circulation, and excreted by the kidneys into the urine. The major metabolite of progesterone in the urine is the 3α,5β,20α isomer of pregnanediol glucuronide, which has been found to constitute 15 to 30% of an injection of progesterone. Other metabolites of progesterone formed by the enzymes in this pathway include 3α-dihydroprogesterone, 3β-dihydroprogesterone, 20α-dihydroprogesterone, and 20β-dihydroprogesterone, as well as various combination products of the enzymes aside from those already mentioned. Progesterone can also first be hydroxylated (see below) and then reduced. Endogenous progesterone is metabolized approximately 50% into 5α-dihydroprogesterone in the corpus luteum, 35% into 3β-dihydroprogesterone in the liver, and 10% into 20α-dihydroprogesterone.

Relatively small portions of progesterone are hydroxylated via 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1) and 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) into 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone (21-hydroxyprogesterone), respectively, and pregnanetriols are formed secondarily to 17α-hydroxylation. Even smaller amounts of progesterone may be also hydroxylated via 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) and to a lesser extent via aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) into 11β-hydroxyprogesterone. In addition, progesterone can be hydroxylated in the liver by other cytochrome P450 enzymes which are not steroid-specific. 6β-Hydroxylation, which is catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4, is the major transformation, and is responsible for approximately 70% of cytochrome P450-mediated progesterone metabolism. Other routes include 6α-, 16α-, and 16β-hydroxylation. However, treatment of women with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, had minimal effects on progesterone levels, producing only a slight and non-significant increase, and this suggests that cytochrome P450 enzymes play only a small role in progesterone metabolism.
===Levels===
Progesterone levels are relatively low during the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, rise after ovulation, and are elevated during the luteal phase, as shown in the diagram above. Progesterone levels tend to be less than 2 ng/mL prior to ovulation and greater than 5 ng/mL after ovulation. If pregnancy occurs, human chorionic gonadotropin is released, maintaining the corpus luteum and allowing it to maintain levels of progesterone. Between 7 and 9 weeks, the placenta begins to produce progesterone in place of the corpus luteum in a process called the luteal-placental shift.

After the luteal-placental shift, progesterone levels start to rise further and may reach 100 to 200 ng/mL at term. Whether a decrease in progesterone levels is critical for the initiation of labor has been argued and may be species-specific. After delivery of the placenta and during lactation, progesterone levels are very low.

Progesterone levels are low in children and postmenopausal people. Adult males have levels similar to those in women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.

====Ranges====
Blood test results should always be interpreted using the reference ranges provided by the laboratory that performed the results. Example reference ranges are listed below.



===Sources===

====Animal====
Progesterone is produced in high amounts in the ovaries (by the corpus luteum) from the onset of puberty to menopause, and is also produced in smaller amounts by the adrenal glands after the onset of adrenarche in both males and females. To a lesser extent, progesterone is produced in nervous tissue, especially in the brain, and in adipose (fat) tissue, as well.

During human pregnancy, progesterone is produced in increasingly high amounts by the ovaries and placenta. At first, the source is the corpus luteum that has been &quot;rescued&quot; by the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) from the conceptus. However, after the 8th week, production of progesterone shifts to the placenta. The placenta utilizes maternal cholesterol as the initial substrate, and most of the produced progesterone enters the maternal circulation, but some is picked up by the fetal circulation and used as substrate for fetal corticosteroids. At term the placenta produces about 250 mg progesterone per day.

An additional animal source of progesterone is milk products. After consumption of milk products the level of bioavailable progesterone goes up.

====Plants====
In at least one plant, &quot;Juglans regia&quot;, progesterone has been detected. In addition, progesterone-like steroids are found in &quot;Dioscorea mexicana&quot;. &quot;Dioscorea mexicana&quot; is a plant that is part of the yam family native to Mexico. It contains a steroid called diosgenin that is taken from the plant and is converted into progesterone. Diosgenin and progesterone are also found in other &quot;Dioscorea&quot; species, as well as in other plants that are not closely related, such as fenugreek.

Another plant that contains substances readily convertible to progesterone is &quot;Dioscorea pseudojaponica&quot; native to Taiwan. Research has shown that the Taiwanese yam contains saponins — steroids that can be converted to diosgenin and thence to progesterone.

Many other &quot;Dioscorea&quot; species of the yam family contain steroidal substances from which progesterone can be produced. Among the more notable of these are &quot;Dioscorea villosa&quot; and &quot;Dioscorea polygonoides&quot;. One study showed that the &quot;Dioscorea villosa&quot; contains 3.5% diosgenin. &quot;Dioscorea polygonoides&quot; has been found to contain 2.64% diosgenin as shown by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Many of the &quot;Dioscorea&quot; species that originate from the yam family grow in countries that have tropical and subtropical climates.

==Medical use==
Progesterone is used as a medication. It is used in combination with estrogens mainly in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and low sex hormone levels. It may also be used alone to treat menopausal symptoms. Studies have shown that transdermal progesterone (skin patch) and oral micronized progesterone are effective treatments for certain symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes and night sweats, which are otherwise referred to as vasomotor symptoms or VMS.

It is also used to support pregnancy and fertility and to treat gynecological disorders. Progesterone has been shown to prevent miscarriage in those with 1) vaginal bleeding early in their current pregnancy and 2) a previous history of miscarriage. Progesterone can be taken by mouth, through the vagina, and by injection into muscle or fat, among other routes.

==Chemistry==

Progesterone is a naturally occurring pregnane steroid and is also known as pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione. It has a double bond (4-ene) between the C4 and C5 positions and two ketone groups (3,20-dione), one at the C3 position and the other at the C20 position.

===Synthesis===
Progesterone is commercially produced by semisynthesis. Two main routes are used: one from yam diosgenin first pioneered by Marker in 1940, and one based on soy phytosterols scaled up in the 1970s. Additional (not necessarily economical) semisyntheses of progesterone have also been reported starting from a variety of steroids. For the example, cortisone can be simultaneously deoxygenated at the C-17 and C-21 position by treatment with iodotrimethylsilane in chloroform to produce 11-keto-progesterone (ketogestin), which in turn can be reduced at position-11 to yield progesterone.

====Marker semisynthesis====

An economical semisynthesis of progesterone from the plant steroid diosgenin isolated from yams was developed by Russell Marker in 1940 for the Parke-Davis pharmaceutical company. This synthesis is known as the Marker degradation.
The 16-DPA intermediate is important to the synthesis of many other medically important steroids. A very similar approach can produce 16-DPA from solanine.

====Soy semisynthesis====
Progesterone can also be made from the stigmasterol found in soybean oil also. c.f. Percy Julian.

====Total synthesis====
A total synthesis of progesterone was reported in 1971 by W.S. Johnson. The synthesis begins with reacting the phosphonium salt 7 with phenyl lithium to produce the phosphonium ylide 8. The ylide 8 is reacted with an aldehyde to produce the alkene 9. The ketal protecting groups of 9 are hydrolyzed to produce the diketone 10, which in turn is cyclized to form the cyclopentenone 11. The ketone of 11 is reacted with methyl lithium to yield the tertiary alcohol 12, which in turn is treated with acid to produce the tertiary cation 13. The key step of the synthesis is the π-cation cyclization of 13 in which the B-, C-, and D-rings of the steroid are simultaneously formed to produce 14. This step resembles the cationic cyclization reaction used in the biosynthesis of steroids and hence is referred to as &quot;biomimetic&quot;. In the next step the enol orthoester is hydrolyzed to produce the ketone 15. The cyclopentene A-ring is then opened by oxidizing with ozone to produce 16. Finally, the diketone 17 undergoes an intramolecular aldol condensation by treating with aqueous potassium hydroxide to produce progesterone.

==History==
George W. Corner and Willard M. Allen discovered the hormonal action of progesterone in 1929. By 1931–1932, nearly pure crystalline material of high progestational activity had been isolated from the corpus luteum of animals, and by 1934, pure crystalline progesterone had been refined and obtained and the chemical structure of progesterone was determined. This was achieved by Adolf Butenandt at the &quot;Chemisches Institut&quot; of Technical University in Danzig, who extracted this new compound from several thousand liters of urine.

Chemical synthesis of progesterone from stigmasterol and pregnanediol was accomplished later that year. Up to this point, progesterone, known generically as corpus luteum hormone, had been being referred to by several groups by different names, including corporin, lutein, luteosterone, and progestin. In 1935, at the time of the Second International Conference on the Standardization of Sex Hormones in London, England, a compromise was made between the groups and the name progesterone (progestational steroidal ketone) was created.

===Veterinary use===
The use of progesterone tests in dog breeding to pinpoint ovulation is becoming more widely used. There are several tests available but the most reliable test is a blood test with blood drawn by a veterinarian and sent to a lab for processing. Results can usually be obtained with 24 to 72 hours. The rationale for using progesterone tests is that increased numbers begin in close proximity to preovulatory surge in gonadotrophins and continue through ovulation and estrus. When progesterone levels reach certain levels they can signal the stage of estrus the female is. Prediction of birth date of the pending litter can be very accurate if ovulation date is known. Puppies deliver with a day or two of 9 weeks gestation in most cases. It is not possible to determine pregnancy using progesterone tests once a breeding has taken place, however. This is due to the fact that, in dogs, progesterone levels remain elevated throughout the estrus period.

=== Pricing ===
Pricing for progesterone can vary depending location, insurance coverage, discount coupons, quantity, shortages, manufacturers, brand or generic versions, different pharmacies, and so on. As of currently, 30 capsules of 100 mg of the generic version, Prometrium, from CVS Pharmacy is around $40 without any discounts or insurance applied. The brand version, Progesterone, is around $450 for 30 capsules without any discounts or insurance applied. In comparison, Walgreens offers 30 capsules of 100 mg in the generic version for $51 without insurance or coupons applied. The brand name costs around $431 for 30 capsules of 100 mg.

<doc id="66436" wikidata="Q1433190" url="?curid=66436" title="Iraq disarmament crisis">
<text>The Iraq disarmament crisis was claimed as one of the primary issues that led to the multinational invasion of Iraq on 20 March 2003.

Since the 1980s, Iraq was widely assumed to have been producing and extensively running the programs of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. Iraq made extensive use of chemical weapons during the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, including against its own Kurdish population. France and the Soviet Union assisted Iraq in the development of its nuclear program, but its primary facility was destroyed by Israel in 1981 in a surprise air strike.

After the Gulf War in 1990, the United Nations Special Commission located and destroyed large quantities of Iraqi chemical weapons and related equipment and materials with varying degrees of Iraqi cooperation and obstruction, but the Iraqi cooperation later diminished in 1998. The disarmament issue remained tense throughout the 1990s with U.S. at the UN, repeatedly demanding Iraq to allow inspections teams to its facilities. These crises reached their climax in 2002-2003, when U.S. President George W. Bush demanded a complete end to what he alleged was Iraqi production of weapons of mass destruction, and reasoned with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to comply with UN Resolutions requiring UN weapons inspectors unfettered access to areas those inspectors thought might have weapons production facilities.

Since the Gulf War in 1991, Iraq had been restricted by the United Nations (UN) from developing or possessing such weapons. It was also required to permit inspections to confirm Iraqi compliance. Bush repeatedly backed demands for unfettered inspection and disarmament with threats of invasion. On 20 March 2003, a multinational alliance containing the armed forces of the United States and United Kingdom launched an invasion of Iraq. After the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, a number of failed Iraqi peace initiatives were revealed.

==Background==
In the decade following the 1991 Gulf War, the United Nations passed 16 Security Council resolutions calling for the complete elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Member states communicated their frustration over the years that Iraq was impeding the work of the UN Special Commission and failing to take seriously its disarmament obligations. Iraqi security forces had on several occasions physically prevented weapons inspectors from doing their job and in at least one case, took documents from them.

On 29 September 1998, the United States Congress passed the &quot;Iraq Liberation Act&quot; supporting the efforts of Iraqi opposition groups to remove Saddam Hussein from office. The Act was signed by President Clinton on 31 October 1998. On the same day, Iraq announced it would no longer cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors.

The UN, under Kofi Annan, brokered a deal wherein Iraq would allow weapons inspectors back into the country. Iraq ceased cooperating with inspectors only days later. The inspectors left the country in December. Inspectors returned the following year as part of The United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC).

Paul Wolfowitz, the military analyst for the United States Department of Defense under Ronald Reagan, had formulated a new foreign policy with regard to Iraq and other &quot;potential aggressor states&quot;, dismissing &quot;containment&quot; in favor of &quot;preemption&quot;, with the goal of striking first to eliminate threats.

This policy was short-lived, however, and Clinton, along with George H. W. Bush, Colin Powell, and other former Bush administration officials, dismissed calls for preemption in favor of continued containment. This was the policy of George W. Bush as well for his first several months in office. The September 11, 2001 attacks brought to life Wolfowitz&#x27;s and other &quot;hawks&#x27;&quot; advocacy for preemptive action; Iraq was widely agreed to be a likely subject of this new policy. Powell continued to support the philosophy behind containment.

Following the Gulf War, the Iraqi Army was reduced to 23 divisions with a total of about 375,000 troops. The Iraqi Air Force was reduced to less than 300 aircraft. The Iraqi Navy was almost completely destroyed, and its few remaining operational vessels were in a poor state of repair, the crews were estimated to be in a poor state of readiness, and its capabilities were reduced to that of limited mining and raiding missions. Any rebuilding that was done went into the Republican Guard, and the formation of the Special Republican Guard.

==2002–2003==
During late 2002 and into 2003, the United States government continued to call for &quot;regime change&quot; in Iraq and threatened to use military force to overthrow the Iraqi government unless Iraq rid itself of all weapons of mass destruction (WMD) it supposedly possessed and convinced the UN that it had done so.

US diplomatic pressure to bring Iraq to compliance quickly created a diplomatic crisis in the UN, where some members were in agreement with the U.S. position, while others dissented, notably the permanent Security Council members France, Russia and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and fellow NATO members Germany and Belgium.

The Bush administration began a military buildup in the region, and after pushing hard gained passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1441. Led by Hans Blix, Head of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and Mohamed ElBaradei Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Resolution brought weapons inspectors back to Iraq in November 2002.

Inspectors began visiting sites where WMD production was suspected, but found no evidence of such activities, except for 18 undeclared empty 122 mm chemical rockets that were destroyed under UNMOVIC supervision. P. 30 Inspectors also found that the Al-Samoud-2 and Al-fatah missiles violated the UN range restrictions, the former also being partially destroyed under UNMOVIC supervision.

On March 7, 2003 Hans Blix reported accelerated cooperation throughout the month of February but it was still not &quot;immediate&quot; and &quot;unconditional&quot; as called for by UN Security Council Resolution 1441. He informed the UN security council that &quot;it will not take years, nor weeks, but months&quot; to verify whether Iraq had complied with its disarmament obligations.

U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair met in the Azores islands for an &quot;emergency summit&quot; over the weekend of March 15–16, 2003, after which Bush declared that, despite Blix&#x27;s report, &quot;diplomacy had failed&quot; to compel Iraq to comply with UN Resolution inspection requirements, and stated his intention to use military force to attack Iraq in what was, according to the Bush administration, compliance with the threat of &quot;serious consequences&quot; in UN 1441.

==UNSC disagreement==
Several close allies of the U.S. (e.g. Germany, Belgium and France) opposed a military intervention because they asserted it would increase rather than decrease the risk of terrorist attacks. Although the British government and some governments of other members of the EU and NATO supported the US position, opinion polls show that in general their populations were against an attack, especially an attack without clear UN Security Council support. Millions of people in the major cities of Europe, and hundreds of thousands in major cities of North America, participated in peace marches on 15 February 2003.

===Statements by President Bush===
On 7 October 2002 President Bush stated:
&quot;Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terrorist groups. The Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism, and practices terror against its own people. The entire world has witnessed Iraq&#x27;s eleven-year history of defiance, deception and bad faith.&quot;

On 17 March 2003 Bush stated in an address to the nation:

&quot;Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised. This regime has already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq&#x27;s neighbors and against Iraq&#x27;s people.&quot;

Two days later on March 19, 2003, as the invasion of Iraq began, Bush stated in an address to the nation:

&quot;&quot;My fellow citizens, at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger.&quot;

===Statement by Russian President Vladimir Putin===
On October 11, 2002, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with then British Prime Minister Tony Blair. At a news conference, he said:

: &quot;Russia does not have in its possession any trustworthy data that supports the existence of nuclear weapons or any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and we have not received any such information from our partners as yet.&quot;

===Statements by French President Jacques Chirac===
In a February 2003 joint declaration by Russia, Germany and France, Jacques Chirac remarked:

: &quot;As far as France is concerned, we are ready to envisage everything that can be done under UNSCR 1441. ... But I repeat that every possibility offered by the present resolution must be explored, that there are a lot of them and they still leave us with a lot of leeway when it comes to ways of achieving the objective of eliminating any weapons of mass destruction which may exist in Iraq. I&#x27;d like nevertheless to note that, as things stand at the moment, I have, to my knowledge, no indisputable proof in this sphere.&quot;

==Legality==
===Authority under International Law===
The position of whether the invasion was legal under international law is unclear. Article 2 of the United Nations Charter forbids UN members from employing &quot;the threat or use of force&quot; against other states in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. Two exceptions exist to the rule: self-defense (Article 51) or an authorization by the Security Council to protect international peace and security (Chapter VII).

The government of the United States said publicly, and the British pledged privately, that they were willing to invade Iraq with or without Security Council authorization.

There have been two military actions carried out with the approval of the Security Council. These two instances were the Korean War and the 1991 Gulf War.

The United States does not recognize the jurisdiction of any international court over its citizens or military, holding that the United States Supreme Court is its final authority. One example of this policy is that the United States did not ratify the International Criminal Court (ICC) treaty, and on 6 May 2002 it informed the UN that it has no intention to do so.

As of 24 February 2005 neither Iraq nor the United States have ratified the ICC treaty, and therefore neither the US attack on Iraq nor subsequent actions in Iraq fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC. The actions of signatories such as the United Kingdom and Spain could however fall under the ICC jurisdiction.

On March 17, 2003, Peter Goldsmith, Attorney General for England and Wales, set out his government&#x27;s legal justification for an invasion of Iraq. He said that the 1990 Security Council Resolution 678 authorised force against Iraq, which was suspended but not terminated by the 1991 Resolution 687, which imposed continuing obligations on Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. A material breach of resolution 687 would revive the authority to use force under resolution 678. In Resolution 1441 the Security Council determined that Iraq was in material breach of resolution 687 because it had not fully carried out its obligations to disarm, and in early 2003 sent teams of weapons inspectors to verify the facts on the ground.

Most member governments of the United Nations Security Council made clear that in their view, after resolution 1441 there was still no authorization for the use of force and that the invasion was illegal under international law. However, the US and its allies argued that no resolution authorizing the invasion would be necessary as they acted in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter and by customary international law. The exercise of that right could not be banned by ceasefire. Since Iraq was not actively disarming themselves of its alleged WMDs and hid them from UN inspectors, the US and its allies claimed they had the right to assume that Iraq was holding WMDs. If the UN failed to force compliance, the US and the UK - as parties of the 1991 conflict - would invade Iraq without the UN, as they had already done in their intervention in the Kosovo War. Yoram Dinstein equates this to police officers cornering a convicted violent felon and saying &quot;put your hands on your head&quot;, but instead he pulls something small and black (whether a gun or not) out of his pocket. Officers would have been justified in shooting him because he could have possessed something that is dangerous.

===Authority under US Constitution===
The Constitution grants the power to declare war exclusively to the United States Congress, but declares the President to be Commander-in-Chief of the US military. Because of this division of power, there has long been controversy regarding the authority of the President outside of a declared war. Nonetheless, of the many instances the United States has exercised force outside its borders, only five have been as part of a declared war.

In 1973, amid increasing domestic controversy about the Vietnam War, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution to limit the ability of the president to undertake prolonged military action without Congressional authority. No president since has recognized the constitutionality of this act, and most legal scholars believe it would not survive a challenge in court.

To avoid initiating a crisis under the War Powers Resolution, the Bush administration sought explicit approval from the Congress to exercise force in Iraq. On October 9, 2002, the Congress passed the Iraq Resolution which explicitly authorized the President to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate. This raises the issue of whether or not Congress has the authority to delegate legislative power to the executive branch. However, in a recent United States Supreme Court case, &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld,&quot; the Supreme Court ruled that the military commissions that the President had established, (and defended by arguing that he was given the power to create military courts by this resolution), were unconstitutional because they were unauthorized by Congress.

The Constitution also provides that international treaties ratified by the United States are among the highest law of the land (US Constitution, Article VI). The UN Charter is a treaty ratified by the US, which forbids member states, including the US, from attacking fellow member states, including Iraq, except in two carefully circumscribed situations (see UN Charter).

==Aftermath==
After the invasion of Iraq, the Iraq Survey Group, headed by David Kay was formed to find the alleged weapons of mass destruction. Apart from a small quantity of degraded pre-1991 shells, nothing was found.
