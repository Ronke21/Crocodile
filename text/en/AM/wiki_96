<text>Grass: A Nation&#x27;s Battle for Life is a 1925 documentary film that follows a branch of the Bakhtiari tribe of Lurs in Persia as they and their herds make their seasonal journey to better pastures. It is considered one of the earliest ethnographic documentary films. In 1997, &quot;Grass&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Production==
The film was directed and produced by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, with intertitles by Richard Carver and Terry Ramsaye. It was the first film produced by the team of Cooper and Schoedsack, who went on to produce &quot;King Kong&quot; and many other films. Cooper was a writer performing research for the American Geographical Society and Schoedsack was a cameraman.

Reporter and former spy Marguerite Harrison was an instrumental member of the production team. Harrison had met Cooper at a ball in Warsaw, and she provided him with food, books and blankets when he was taken prisoner by the Russians in 1920 and sent to work in a prison camp. Harrison also appears in the film as herself. Years later, Schoedsack commented that Harrison had not done &quot;a damn thing&quot; during the expedition.

Funding was provided by a loan of $5,000 from Cooper&#x27;s father and brother, and Harrison contributed an additional $5,000.

In filming the journey, Cooper, Schoedsack, and Harrison became the first Westerners to make the migration with the Bakhtiari. The only previous ethnographic documentary was Robert Flaherty&#x27;s &quot;Nanook of the North&quot; (1922). According to Cooper, the filmmakers were unaware of &quot;Nanook&quot; until their return to New York City from filming in Persia.

==Summary==

The film&#x27;s producers were mainly concerned with documenting a way of life that was unknown to all those outside the Bakhtiari realm. The film highlights the extreme hardships faced by nomadic peoples, as well as the bravery and ingenuity of the Bakhtiari on their migration in search of grass, which meant abundant seasonal pasture for their animals.

&quot;Grass&quot; documents the caravan route from Angora (modern-day Ankara, Turkey) to the Bakhtiari lands in Persia (western Iran in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province and the eastern part of Khuzestan). The film then follows Haidar Khan as he leads 50,000 of his people and countless animals on a harrowing trek across the Karun River and over Zard Kuh, a subrange of the Zagros Mountains.

==Reception==

In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; critic Mordaunt Hall wrote: &quot;It is an unusual and remarkable film offering, one that is instructive and compelling but in no way a story. There is drama interspersed with captivating comedy, and the audience last night applauded some of the wonderful photographic sequences and at other times they were moved to laughter by the antics of the animals.&quot;

The film was first shown at The Explorers Club annual dinner held at the Hotel McAlpin in New York City on January 24, 1925, along with a lecture by Cooper. The &quot;Explorers Journal&quot; reported: &quot;It is Mr. Cooper&#x27;s happy achievement to have portrayed poignantly and comprehensively the drama of a people in their primitive struggle with inexorable forces of nature. The pictures were a fitting climax to an evening of thrilling entertainment.&quot;&quot;Grass&quot; was later purchased for distribution by Paramount Pictures. Its theatrical debut took place at the Criterion Theatre in New York on March 30, 1925.

==Planned remake==
In 1947, Merian C. Cooper sought to remake &quot;Grass,&quot; which he called a &quot;damned half picture,&quot; and he said: &quot;One man and one woman, and their children, will exemplify for the audience the whole of this struggle for survival which breeds a race that is proud and strong, rugged individuals all, meeting bravely the moods of natural forces seemingly bent upon their destruction.&quot; Ernest B. Schoedsack told him to forget the idea because his Persian friends had informed him that a rail line now ran through the country, and much of the Bakhtiari&#x27;s trek was now performed using cars and trucks.

==Reissue==
&quot;Grass&quot; was reissued theatrically in the early 1990s. Rights to &quot;Grass&quot; had been donated to the Museum of Modern Art, and Milestone Film and Video obtained the rights in 1990. Dennis Doros of Milestone said:

Out of the one hundred and fifty to two hundred films we&#x27;ve done, &quot;Grass&quot; and &quot;&quot; are among the ones I am most proud of distributing. &quot;Chang&quot; is a national treasure in Thailand. &quot;Grass&quot; has images of race and culture that don&#x27;t exist anymore, it&#x27;s been called the greatest migration in modern history, and I agree. The journey of the Bakhtiari is so astonishing, the power of those images is like a dream, the way they&#x27;re constantly moving and climbing.

&quot;Grass&quot; has been issued in videocassette and DVD format. It is also available for streaming on the Criterion Channel.

In 2009, author Bahman Maghsoudlou published a book titled &quot;Grass: Untold Stories&quot; that includes background information and historical references related to the making of the film.

<text>North Bay is a city in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It is the seat of Nipissing District and takes its name from its position on the shore of Lake Nipissing. It developed as a railroad centre and its airport was an important military location during the Cold War.

==History==


The site of North Bay is part of a historic canoe route where Samuel de Champlain took a party up the Ottawa River, through present-day Mattawa, on to Trout Lake and via the La Vase Creek to Lake Nipissing.

Apart from Indigenous people, voyageurs and surveyors, there was little activity in the Lake Nipissing area until the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in 1882.

That was the point where the Canada Central Railway (CCR) extension ended. The CCR was owned by Duncan McIntyre who amalgamated it with the CPR and became one of the handful of officers of the newly formed CPR. The CCR started in Brockville and extended to Pembroke. It then followed a westward route along the Ottawa River passing through places like Cobden, Deux-Rivières, and eventually to Mattawa at the confluence of the Mattawa and Ottawa Rivers. It then proceeded cross-country toward its final destination, Bonfield. Duncan McIntyre and his contractor James Worthington piloted the CCR expansion. Worthington continued on as the construction superintendent for the CPR past Bonfield. He remained with the CPR for about a year until he left the company. McIntyre was uncle to John Ferguson, who staked out future North Bay after getting assurance from his uncle and Worthington that it would be the divisional headquarters and a location of some importance.

In 1882, John Ferguson decided that the north bay of Lake Nipissing was a promising spot for settlement. North Bay was incorporated as a town in 1891. The first mayor was John Bourke. More importantly, Bourke developed the western portion of North Bay after purchasing the interest of the Murray Brothers from Pembroke, who were large landholders in the new community. The land west of Klock Avenue (Algonquin Avenue) was known as the Murray block. Bourke Street is named after John Bourke. Murray Street is named after the Murrays.

North Bay was selected as the southern terminus of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (T&amp;NO) in 1902, when the Ross government took the bold move to establish a development road to serve the Haileybury settlement. During construction of the T&amp;NO, silver was discovered at Cobalt and started a mining frenzy in the northern part of the province that continued for many years. The Canadian Northern Railway was subsequently built to North Bay in 1913.

In July 1894, an Act to Charter the Montreal, Ottawa and Georgian Bay Canal passed without a ripple of concern in North Bay. The Georgian Bay Canal was a mammoth transportation system that proposed to connect the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean. The entire passageway from the Ottawa River to Lake Nipissing and down the French River to Georgian Bay was surveyed in the first decade of the 20th century. Financing was a large obstacle and, as time passed, transportation patterns changed and interfered with the earlier practicality of the giant venture. Despite this, there were groups who still hoped it would happen as late as 1930.

North Bay grew through a strong lumbering sector, mining and the three railways in the early days. The town benefited from strong community leadership and people like Richardson, Milne, McNamara, Englands, Browning, McDougal, Carruthers, McGaughey, George W. Lee, Senator Gordon, T. J. Patton, Charlie Harrison and many others are responsible for its development. In 1919, John Ferguson was elected mayor of North Bay and continued to serve as mayor until 1922. North Bay was incorporated as a city in August 1925.

The Dionne Quintuplets were born in Corbeil, Ontario, on the southern outskirts of North Bay in 1934. Their births had a tremendous impact on tourism in the area. For a province struggling against economic strangulation they were as valuable a resource as gold, nickel, pulpwood or hydro power. They saved an entire region from bankruptcy. They launched Northern Ontario&#x27;s flourishing tourist industry. At their peak they represented a $500 million asset. North Bay and the surrounding area lived off this legacy well into the 1960s. Many visitors to the area discovered lakes and summer retreats that were easily accessible, and the businesses thrived on the tourist dollars.

In January 1968, the City of North Bay amalgamated with West Ferris and Widdifield townships.

In 1951, as a result of rising tensions in the Cold War, the Royal Canadian Air Force established an air base at North Bay, part of an expanding national air defence network to counter the threat of nuclear attack against North America by Soviet bombers. Construction of RCAF Station North Bay (in 1966 retitled &quot;Canadian Forces Base North Bay&quot; and in 1993 as &quot;22 Wing/Canadian Forces Base North Bay&quot;) took three years, during which it became the largest industry in the community: a status it held for more than four decades. In October 1963, the North American Air Defence Command (NORAD) opened its Canadian operations centre at the base. Staffed by American as well as Canadian military personnel, the centre, situated 60 storeys underground to withstand a nuclear strike, monitored Canada&#x27;s northern, east-central and Atlantic airspace, identifying and tracking all air traffic in this airspace, and responding to airborne emergencies, crime, and suspicious, unknown and potentially hostile aircraft. In 1983 this responsibility was expanded to all of Canada, and in October 2006 the base&#x27;s NORAD operations (as of 1981, called North American Aerospace Defence Command) moved into a new, state-of-the-art facility above ground, where it continues to provide surveillance, identification and tracking of aircraft, and warning and response to emergencies, attacks and other crises, for the air sovereignty of Canada and North America. In summer of 2013, the base commenced surveillance of space via SAPPHIRE, Canada&#x27;s first military satellite, that was launched into orbit from India in February.

Beginning in the 1990s, the base weathered a series of massive cuts by the federal government, and at one point was earmarked to close. Subsequently, a large portion of its infrastructure, including all of its airfield assets, such as hangars, fuel depot and control tower, were sold or demolished. By the 21st century, the base was no longer the city&#x27;s top industry.

One by-product of the air base&#x27;s creation in 1951 was the extension of the existing airport&#x27;s runways to handle the largest military aircraft. The long runways at North Bay have been maintained as an alternate landing site for Toronto&#x27;s Pearson International Airport and were used during the September 11 crisis as an emergency landing site for several international aircraft. It was also a designated emergency field for NASA&#x27;s Space Transportation System, better known as the Space Shuttle.

On March 17, 2007, North Bay was announced as the winner of 2007 Kraft Hockeyville contest. North Bay received $50,000 to upgrade their local arena, Memorial Gardens, and also hosted an NHL pre-season game between the New York Islanders and the Atlanta Thrashers.

==Geography==

North Bay is located approximately north of Toronto, and differs in geography from Southern Ontario in that North Bay is situated on the Canadian Shield. This gives rise to a different and more rugged landscape.

North Bay is geographically unique in that it straddles both the Ottawa River watershed to the east and the Great Lakes Basin to the west. The city&#x27;s urban core is located between Lake Nipissing and the smaller Trout Lake.

North Bay, critically situated at the junctions of Highway 11 and Highway 17, remains a major transportation centre for Northern Ontario. It is the southern terminus of the Ontario Northland Railway, and is served by the Jack Garland Airport.

The area of North Bay contains a number of ancient volcanic pipes, including the Manitou Islands and Callander Bay and many exposed dykes and five named batholiths (Timber Lake, Mulock, West Arm, Powassan and Bonfield).

=== Climate ===
The climate in North Bay is common to most places in Northern Ontario. North Bay tends to be a less humid climate than that found in Southern Ontario due somewhat to the distance from the Great Lakes and less warm than some other locations in Northern Ontario due to cooling from Lake Nipissing. On May 31, 2002, a tornado caused minor damage near the city. Two more tornadoes touched down on Lake Nipissing on August 20, 2009. This storm was a part of a chain of tornadoes that caused large amounts of damage in other parts of Ontario. The weather box below shows climate normals for the airport, at an elevation of 358 m, but the majority of the city, including the downtown core, sits at an elevation of 201 m.

The highest temperature ever recorded in North Bay was on 1 July 1931. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 26 January 1892.

==Economy==
North Bay is more economically diverse than many other Northern Ontario communities, although a large percentage of the city&#x27;s jobs are public sector in nature with health, education and government dominating the list of the city&#x27;s top employers.

North Bay is the home of Nipissing University, founded in 1992 (previous name North Bay Normal School 1909–1953, North Bay Teachers College 1953–1973, Nipissing University affiliated to Laurentian University 1973–1992, independent public university separated from Laurentian University in 1992), and of Canadore College, founded in 1967. Approximately 10,000 full-time students (and thousands more part-time students) are enrolled at the two post-secondary institutions, which share a campus in the northwest end of the city.

Between the early 1950s and 1990s, 22 Wing/Canadian Forces Base North Bay was the community&#x27;s leading industry. The cuts to the base by the federal government mentioned above, plus dramatic reductions in the number of its personnel — at one time, there were 2,200 military members and civilian employees; in 2013, about 750 remained — has resulted in a loss of tens of millions of dollars to the community, an impact felt by all North Bay&#x27;s business sectors.

North Bay is also home to The Algonquin Regiment (Northern Pioneers), A Coy, a Canadian Force Army Reserve unit. B Coy of The Algonquin Regiment (Northern Pioneers) is located in Timmins.

The service industry, tourism, and transportation also play a significant role in the city&#x27;s economy, as well as primary industry companies. It is estimated that North Bay has more than 65 companies that offer mining supplies and services, employing almost 3,000 residents.

In recent years, the city&#x27;s cultural scene has expanded due to its community of artists, musicians, actors and writers. In 2004, the TVOntario program &quot;Studio 2&quot; named North Bay as one of the top three most artistically talented communities in the province.

==Film and television==
The city has hosted film productions. In 1942, &quot;Captains of the Clouds&quot; was filmed in North Bay at the height of the Second World War. The film starred James Cagney as a Canadian bush pilot and also featured an appearance of famed fighter pilot Billy Bishop. The city has continued to host film productions, including the 2013 horror film &quot;The Colony&quot; starring Laurence Fishburne and Bill Paxton, and the drama &quot;Still Mine&quot;, featuring James Cromwell in an award-winning role. Another film production that occurred in North Bay was the 2014 thriller film &quot;Backcountry&quot;.

In August 2009, the comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall began filming their mini-series &quot;Death Comes to Town&quot; on location in North Bay. More recently, the city hosted production of the third season of &quot;Hard Rock Medical&quot;.

The city is fictionalised as &quot;Algonquin Bay&quot; in the mystery novels of North Bay native Giles Blunt, beginning with &quot;Forty Words for Sorrow&quot;. The television series adaptation &quot;Cardinal&quot; was filmed in both North Bay and Sudbury in 2016.

In 2017, the crime drama series &quot;Carter&quot; was filmed in the city.

In 2021, the reality series &quot;Call Me Mother&quot; was filmed in North Bay.

In 2022, North Star Studios announced the acquisition of a building in the West Ferris Industrial Park, which will provide 68,000 square feet of film and television studio space.

==Education==
North Bay has educational programs ranging from pre-school to university.

Clowe Rotary Park, Nipissing Junction, Pinewood, Sage, Ski Club, St. John&#x27;s Village, Sunset Park, Thibeault Terrace, Thorncliff, Trout Mills, Tweedsmuir, Wallace Heights, West Ferris and Widdifield.

==Waterfront development==
The city has big plans for the waterfront. In the 1980s a mile-long waterfront park/promenade was developed along the Lake Nipissing shoreline adjacent to the downtown core. Eventually, such attractions as a mini-train ride and two antique carousels (largely crafted by local artisans) were installed and quickly became very popular with tourists and locals alike. Now, work is beginning on a large new multi-faceted community park that will be developed on the former Canadian Pacific Railway yards that separated the downtown core from the existing waterfront park. In August 2009, a new pedestrian underpass opened connecting the downtown core to the waterfront for the first time since the CPR laid down tracks. In 2019 the city constructed a multi-phase community space centering on a Splash Pad behind the CPR museum.

==Media==
The local newspaper is the &quot;North Bay Nugget&quot;, which is published in print form from Tuesday through Saturday.

BayToday.ca is an online local news source in North Bay, offering news, weather updates, entertainment, sports and business features. 

CKNY-DT is an owned-and-operated television station of CTV. Part of the CTV Northern Ontario subsystem, CKNY functions largely as a rebroadcaster of CICI-TV in Greater Sudbury, although news reporters in North Bay provide content to CTV Northern Ontario&#x27;s newscasts. In May 2020, its local studio on Oak Street was closed, and its staff was reduced to two reporters and a cameraman/editor, all of whom now working remotely. The local Cogeco Cable system operates a community channel under the YourTV branding, which produces a slate of local newscasts under the &quot;Cogeco News&quot; branding.

In radio, North Bay effectively acts as a single market with the nearby town of Sturgeon Falls, with virtually all stations in both communities serving the whole region.

===North Bay Battalion===
The North Bay Battalion is a major junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League based in North Bay, Ontario, Canada. The franchise was founded as the Brampton Battalion on December 3, 1996, and began play in 1998. Due to consistently poor attendance, the team relocated to North Bay before the 2013–14 OHL season.

===Nipissing Lakers Hockey===
The Nipissing Lakers are North Bay&#x27;s newest hockey team. The Lakers are the 19th member of the Ontario University Athletics&#x27; Men&#x27;s Hockey League (founded in 2009 in a partnership with Nipissing University and private investors). The Lakers play in historic Memorial Gardens (circa 1955) and share the building with the North Bay Trappers. Like their Northern Ontario counterparts in Thunder Bay (the Lakehead Thunderwolves), the Lakers attract an impressive number of local hockey supporters for their games in the OUA.

===North Bay Trappers Junior &quot;A&quot;===
The North Bay Trappers (formerly the North Bay Skyhawks) were relocated from Sturgeon Falls in 2002 (following the departure of the OHL&#x27;s North Bay Centennials to Saginaw, Michigan). The Trappers are members of the 8 team NOJHL Junior &quot;A&quot; circuit (Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League). The Skyhawks/Trappers franchise has won 3 NOJHL championship titles (2002–03, 2003–04 &amp; 2004–05). In April 2014 the Trappers were sold to become the Mattawa Blackhawks

==Transportation==

North Bay is located at the easternmost junction of Highway 11 and Highway 17, which are both segments of the Trans-Canada Highway. The two highways share a single route through the city core, between Algonquin Avenue and an interchange at Twin Lakes, along an urban limited-access road with reduced but not fully controlled access. Major arterial streets intersect directly with the highway, while minor streets end at a network of service roads connecting them to the arterials. At Algonquin Avenue, Highway 17 continues westward to Sturgeon Falls and Sudbury, while Highway 11 heads north toward Temiskaming Shores. At the eastern interchange, Highway 17 heads eastward toward Mattawa, Pembroke and Ottawa, while Highway 11 widens into a freeway and heads southerly toward Barrie and Toronto.

Highway 11 and Highway 17 both formerly had business spur routes through downtown North Bay, Highway 11B and Highway 17B, although both have been decommissioned by the province and are now designated only as city streets.

<doc id="73919" wikidata="Q470329" url="?curid=73919" title="The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)">
<text>The Great Train Robbery is a 1903 American silent Western action film made by Edwin S. Porter for the Edison Manufacturing Company. It follows a gang of outlaws who hold up and rob a steam train at a station in the American West, flee across mountainous terrain, and are finally defeated by a posse of locals. The short film draws on many sources, including a robust existing tradition of Western films, recent European innovations in film technique, the play of the same name by Scott Marble, the popularity of train-themed films, and possibly real-life incidents involving outlaws such as Butch Cassidy.

Porter supervised and photographed the film in New York and New Jersey in November 1903; the Edison studio began selling it to vaudeville houses and other venues in the following month. The cast included Justus D. Barnes and G. M. Anderson, who may have also helped with planning and staging. Porter&#x27;s storytelling approach, though not particularly innovative or unusual for 1903, allowed him to include many popular techniques of the time, including scenes staged in wide shots, a matte effect, and an attempt to indicate simultaneous action across multiple scenes. Camera pans, location shooting, and moments of violent action helped give &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; a sense of rough-edged immediacy. A special close-up shot, which was unconnected to the story and could either begin or end the film depending on the projectionist&#x27;s whim, showed Barnes, as the outlaw leader, emptying his gun directly into the camera.

Due in part to its popular and accessible subject matter, as well as to its dynamic action and violence, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; was an unprecedented commercial success. Though it did not significantly influence or advance the Western film genre upon release, it was widely distributed and copied, including in a parody by Porter himself. During the twentieth century, inaccurate legends about &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; developed, claiming it was the first Western or even the first film to include a plot. Film scholars have repeatedly disproved these claims, demonstrating that &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; was a stylistic dead-end for its maker and genre. However, its commercial success and mythical status in film history nonetheless remain undisputed; the film has since become one of the greatest and most influential Westerns of all time, appearing in numerous film and television references and homages. In 1990, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Two bandits break into a railroad telegraph office, where they force the operator at gunpoint to stop a train and order its engineer to fill the locomotive&#x27;s tender at the station&#x27;s water tank. They then knock the operator out and tie him up. It is boarded by the bandits. Two bandits enter an express car and open a box of valuables with dynamite. The others kill the fireman and force the engineer to halt the train and disconnect its locomotive. The bandits then force the passengers off the train and rifle them for their belongings. One passenger tries to escape but is instantly shot down. The bandits escape in the locomotive.

The bound operator awakens but collapses again. His daughter arrives and she restores him to consciousness by dousing him with water. There is some comic relief at a dance hall, where an Eastern stranger is forced to dance while the locals fire at his feet. The door suddenly opens and the telegraph operator rushes in to tell them of the robbery. The men quickly form a posse and chase the bandits through the mountains. The posse finally overtakes the bandits and kills them all and recovers the stolen mail.

A standalone scene titled &quot;Realism&quot; presents a medium close-up of the leader of the outlaws, who empties his pistol point-blank directly into the camera.

== Production ==

=== Background ===

In the years leading up to &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, the film industry was marked by much innovation and variety. Some studios, such as the Edison Manufacturing Company and the Lumière company, were best known for short sketches and actuality films presented in a straightforward style, often only a single shot long. However, other filmmakers aimed for more elaborate productions; Georges Méliès&#x27;s films, such as the 1902 international success &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;, became acclaimed for their visual storytelling, often encompassing multiple scenes and involving careful editing and complicated special effects. Meanwhile, British filmmakers working in and around Brighton, a group later nicknamed the &quot;Brighton School&quot;, made many innovations in narrative film grammar, developing framing and cutting conventions that would become industry standards.

Edwin S. Porter had won acclaim making cameras, film printers, and projectors; however, after his workshop was destroyed by a fire, he accepted a special commission for the Edison Manufacturing Company in 1901. His task to improve Edison&#x27;s existing projecting equipment was a marked success, and Porter was given a regular job as the cameraman for Edison&#x27;s New York film studio; at the time being a cameraman meant operating the camera as well as exercising creative control in a way that would later be called film directing. His early films were sketches and actualities in the simple style used by other Edison employees. However, his job also gave him the chance to view the many foreign films the Edison company were distributing and pirating, and around 1901 or 1902 he discovered the more complex works being made by Méliès and the Brighton School. Porter began attempts to bring Edison films to a similar level of achievement, later recalling, &quot;From laboratory examination of some of the popular films of the French pioneer director, George Méliès—trick films like &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;—I came to the conclusion that a picture telling a story might draw the customers back to the theatres, and set to work in this direction.&quot;

The Edison studio, facing growing competition from other American companies, welcomed Porter&#x27;s ambitious plans. His first major attempts at elaborate storytelling films included a 1902 adaptation of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; in imitation of Méliès, and a 1903 &quot;Life of an American Fireman&quot; in the style of a notable Brighton School film, &quot;Fire!&quot; His films did well and were influential, bolstered by his status as the leading filmmaker at the most important American studio. In October 1903 Porter joined forces with a new Edison hire, Max Aronson, who was a young stage actor billed as G. M. Anderson. Anderson&#x27;s initial jobs for the studio were inventing sight gags and playing occasional roles, but he was soon working with Porter on creative collaborations. Porter&#x27;s next major film was &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;; Porter was in charge of production and photography, while Anderson may have assisted on staging.

=== Inspirations ===

Porter (and possibly Anderson) drew on various sources when planning the scenario for &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;. Western themes were already popular in films and other entertainment, reflecting the wide public interest in stories about the past and present of the American West. Many American films before 1900 can be classified as Westerns, such as actuality views of cowboy life, staged Western anecdotes like &quot;A Bluff from a Tenderfoot&quot; and &quot;Cripple Creek Bar-Room Scene&quot; (both 1899), and shots of Annie Oakley and of Oglala and Brulé dancers from Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show (both 1894). Studios abroad also began telling Western stories early on, with Mitchell and Kenyon&#x27;s 1899 British film &quot;Kidnapping by Indians&quot; the first known example. Edison&#x27;s 1901 film &quot;Stage Coach Hold-up&quot;, based on Buffalo Bill&#x27;s &quot;Hold-up of the Deadwood Stage&quot; act, probably influenced Porter directly. Porter may have also been inspired by recent real events related to the American West: in August 1900, Butch Cassidy and his gang had robbed a Union Pacific Railroad train and escaped capture, and in September 1903, Bill Miner&#x27;s gang made an unsuccessful holdup of an Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company train.

For the film&#x27;s title and basic concept, Porter looked to Scott Marble&#x27;s &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, a popular stage melodrama that had premiered in Chicago in 1896 and had been revived in New York in 1902. The play covers the adventures of a Texas criminal gang who attempt to steal a $50,000 gold shipment from a Wells Fargo office in Missouri. Their initial scheme is for a mole planted in the company to make off with the gold before it leaves Missouri by train; this plan goes awry, and only leads to an innocent man&#x27;s arrest. However, using information received at a Texas mountain saloon, the gang are still able to stop the train, blast open the car containing the gold, and bring it back to their secret hideout in a Red River canyon. The United States Marshals Service tracks down the gang and finally defeats them in a climactic fight, with cowboys and Native Americans drawn into the fray.

For the narrative style, Porter likely drew freely on various recent popular films, made by filmmakers experimenting with elaborate storytelling. &quot;A Daring Daylight Burglary&quot;, a British chase drama from the Sheffield Photo Company, has frequently been cited as particularly influential; it and another British film, &quot;Desperate Poaching Affray&quot;, were successfully imported to America and started a decade-long vogue for films centered on chases. &quot;A Daring Daylight Burglary&quot;″s story and editing appear to have supplied the overall narrative structure for &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, though in the latter film the chase is only made explicit in one shot, the twelfth. Porter&#x27;s plot also profited from the booming popularity of railroad-related film attractions, such as phantom rides and standalone comic scenes set on trains. &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; would treat the rail theme more elaborately than was common, showing its train from various angles and involving it in a dramatic adventure.

=== Filming ===

Porter filmed &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; in November 1903. Some scenes were photographed at the Edison studio in New York, and others were done in New Jersey, in Essex County Park and along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. The stream-crossing scene was filmed at Thistle Mill Ford in the South Mountain Reservation of Essex County Park. The cast included Justus D. Barnes as the leader of the outlaws, Walter Cameron as the sheriff and G. M. Anderson in three small roles (the murdered passenger, the dancing tenderfoot, and one of the robbers). Many Edison workers were among the extras. Edison filmmaker J. Blair Smith was one of the camera operators.

According to rumors in a contemporary &quot;New York Times&quot; piece on the film, the Edison Company initially attempted to get the railroad company to lend their tracks and cars for free, arguing that it would be good publicity for the line; the railroad directors disagreed, but eventually allowed their resources to be used if Edison also made a more straightforward advertising film for them. The article adds that a real fireman and engineer play those respective parts in the film, and that the filming caused some disturbance when the dummy thrown off the locomotive was mistaken by passersby for a real accident victim.

Porter&#x27;s visual style for &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; was not cutting edge for 1903; it is comparable to numerous other films released around the same time, such as &quot;The Escaped Lunatic&quot;, a popular Biograph Studios comedy about wardens chasing an escapee from a mental institution, and &quot;Runaway Match&quot;, a British Gaumont film featuring an extended car chase sequence. &quot;Mary Jane&#x27;s Mishap&quot;, a landmark dark comedy made by Brighton pioneers G. A. Smith and Laura Bayley and released months before &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, is far more sophisticated in its editing and framing. Porter&#x27;s style heavily prioritized action over character, with most figures remaining indistinguishable in wide shots; the staging inconsistently mixes stylized theatrical blocking with more naturalistic action. The film also leaves many narrative points ambiguous, requiring explanations to be filled in by a live narrator or by audience imaginations.

However, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; successfully collected many popular themes and prevalent techniques of the time into a single accessible narrative. Porter cut his shots together to suggest action happening simultaneously in different locations, as he had done (albeit less efficiently) in &quot;Life of an American Fireman&quot;. The use of real outdoor locations and violent action helped keep the film dynamic, as did technical strategies such as a matte combining a studio scene with outdoor footage, and three shots in which the camera moves. These three shots add an edge of realism and immediacy, with the frame following the action as if recording real life in a documentary style; one of these shots, showing the robbers making off with their loot, even requires the mounted camera to attempt a tricky diagonal pan, creating a jagged effect.

The final shot, in which Barnes fires at the camera in a framing reminiscent of a wanted poster, is the film&#x27;s only close-up, and does not function as part of the plot. Porter rarely used close-ups, especially in his later years, preferring to save them for special standalone effects like this one. Edison&#x27;s promotional leaflet about the film describes this scene as follows:

The catalogue&#x27;s informal approach to where the scene should be placed was not unique to &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;; Porter&#x27;s film &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, released earlier in 1903, had included a boat race scene that was variously advertised as Scene 5 (where it would make some narrative sense) or as Scene 10 (where it would not). Such shots, designed primarily for spectacle rather than for narrative coherency, characterize a popular early-film style later dubbed the &quot;cinema of attractions&quot;.

==Release and reception==

In 1903, the most common American film venue was vaudeville houses, where films were exhibited as part of a varied bill of entertainment; other informal venues also sometimes showed films. The Edison Manufacturing Company announced &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; to exhibitors in early November 1903, calling it a &quot;highly sensationalized Headliner&quot;. To secure copyright, they submitted a rough cut of the film (about fifteen feet longer than the final cut) to the Library of Congress, where it survives as a paper print. The final release print was made available in early December 1903. Edison sold it to exhibitors for , as a 740-foot reel. The first known showing of &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; was at a New York City dime museum, Huber&#x27;s Museum. By the following week it was appearing at eleven venues in the city area, including the Eden Musée, a major amusement center. Edison advertisements touted the film as &quot;absolutely the superior of any moving picture ever made&quot; and a &quot;faithful imitation of the genuine &#x27;Hold Ups&#x27; made famous by various outlaw bands in the far West&quot;. A number of prints of &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; survive; a few of these were heavily edited and altered by their owners, but most are in their release state, and at least one is hand-colored.

&quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; was a major commercial success for the Edison company. It played as the headlining attraction in many vaudeville houses, and showed up frequently at two other entertainment venues that proliferated across the country in the following years: immersive venues where the spectator took simulated railroad journeys, such as Hale&#x27;s Tours of the World, and a new kind of film venue, the nickelodeon, where &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; was often the first attraction shown. It was the first film shown at Harry Davis and John P. Harris&#x27; Nickelodeon theater. Overall, it may have had the biggest success of any film made before 1905. Its popularity was helped by its timely subject matter (as train robberies were still a familiar news item), as well as its striking depictions of action and violence. Unusually for the time, the film was even described in detail in &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot;; the anonymous reviewer criticized most of the players, but praised the horse riding and stunts, concluding: &quot;All this is the result of poor acting, but the results are certainly astounding.&quot;

The film was also widely imitated and copied; the Lubin Manufacturing Company made a shot-for-shot remake in August 1904, changing only small details. (Film copyright was legally murky until 1912, so despite the film&#x27;s Library of Congress registration, unauthorized remakes and adaptations could be made with impunity.) Porter himself directed a 1905 parody of the film, &quot;The Little Train Robbery&quot;, with children robbing candy and dolls from a miniature railroad car. But despite its wide success and imitators, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; did not lead to a significant increase in Western films; instead, the genre continued essentially as it had before, in a scattered mix of short actualities and longer stories. The Western genre would not proliferate in earnest until 1908; one of the leading contributors to this boom was G. M. Anderson, now billed as Broncho Billy Anderson. Porter continued to make films for more than a decade after, usually in a similar editing style to &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, with few additional technical innovations. One historian commented that later efforts like &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1913) were &quot;if anything a retrogression from &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; and had less innate cinema sense.&quot; However, some of Porter&#x27;s post-&quot;Robbery&quot; works continued to be imaginative in content, including &quot;The Kleptomaniac&quot;, a notable 1905 social justice film.

==Legacy==

In the decades after &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, various inaccurate legends developed, exaggerating its historical significance. By mid-century, mistaken claims that it was the &quot;first Western&quot; or even the &quot;first story film&quot; were common. Critiquing these inaccurate legends and citing the film&#x27;s actual lack of impact on the Western genre, historian Scott Simmon comments that in fact the film&#x27;s &quot;main surprise in retrospect is how it led nowhere, either for its creator or the genre, beyond serving loosely as a narrative model for gun-wielding crime and horse-chase retribution.&quot; Claims about historical priority continued to be repeated by general-audience writers into the early twenty-first century.

Later film critics, abandoning the exaggerated claims, have tended to explain the film&#x27;s significance mostly in terms of its wide popularity and Porter&#x27;s influential action-driven storytelling. William Everson and George Fenin dubbed it &quot;the first dramatically creative American film&quot;, while Robert Sklar praised the film&#x27;s capacity &quot;to unite motion picture spectacle with myth and stories about America that were shared by people throughout the world.&quot; Historians have cited &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; as Porter&#x27;s most important film, and noted it as a popular early film that collects numerous important Western tropes, such as &quot;elements of fisticuffs, horseback pursuit and gunplay&quot;. Film historian Pamela Hutchinson highlights especially the iconic close-up scene, &quot;a jolt of terror as disconcerting as a hand bursting from a grave&quot;:

&quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; was added to the United States National Film Registry in 1990. In popular culture, numerous films and television shows have referenced the film and the iconic Barnes close-up:
* Historian James Chapman compares the &quot;James Bond&quot; gun barrel sequences, conceived by Maurice Binder, to the close-up.
* The &quot;Batman&quot; episode &quot;The Riddler&#x27;s False Notion&quot; (1966) guest-stars silent film icon Francis X. Bushman as a film collector who owns a print of &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;.
* The German ZDF series &quot;Western von gestern&quot; (1978–1986) uses the Barnes close-up for its opening and closing sequences.
* The final scene of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990), in which Tommy DeVito (portrayed by Joe Pesci) shoots at the camera, recreates the close-up as a homage. Scorsese has commented that the shot is &quot;…a reference to the end of &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;… And the plot of this picture is very similar to &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;.&quot;
*The supernatural thriller television series &quot;Evil&quot; (2019) has an image of the iconic Barnes close up in the opening credits at the half-point between 18:20 and 18:21. The credits of the same episode feature a trigger warning with the words &quot;subliminal glimpses of sex and violence&quot; with show creators previously having referenced unexpected violent imagery as a necessary component in the series’ model.

<doc id="73930" wikidata="Q690583" url="?curid=73930" title="Greed (1924 film)">
<text>Greed is a 1924 American silent psychological drama film written and directed by Erich von Stroheim and based on the 1899 Frank Norris novel &quot;McTeague&quot;. It stars Gibson Gowland as Dr. John McTeague; ZaSu Pitts as Trina Sieppe, his wife; and Jean Hersholt as McTeague&#x27;s friend and eventual enemy Marcus Schouler. The film tells the story of McTeague, a San Francisco dentist, who marries his best friend Schouler&#x27;s girlfriend Trina.

&quot;Greed&quot; was one of the few films of its time to be shot entirely on location, with von Stroheim shooting approximately 85 hours of footage before editing. Two months alone were spent shooting in Death Valley for the film&#x27;s final sequence, and many of the cast and crew became ill. Von Stroheim used sophisticated filming techniques such as deep focus cinematography and montage editing. He considered &quot;Greed&quot; to be a Greek tragedy, in which environment and heredity controlled the characters&#x27; fates and reduced them to primitive &quot;bêtes humaines&quot; (human beasts), a naturalistic concept in the vein of Zola.

During editing, the production company merged into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), putting Irving Thalberg in charge of post-production. Thalberg had fired von Stroheim a few years earlier at Universal Pictures. Originally almost eight hours long, &quot;Greed&quot; was edited against von Stroheim&#x27;s wishes to about two-and-a-half hours. Only twelve people saw the full-length 42-reel version, now lost; some of them called it the greatest film ever made. Von Stroheim later called &quot;Greed&quot; his most fully realized work and was hurt both professionally and personally by the studio&#x27;s re-editing of it.

The uncut version has been called the &quot;holy grail&quot; for film archivists, amid repeated false claims of the discovery of the missing footage. In 1999, Turner Entertainment created a four-hour version that used existing stills of cut scenes to reconstruct the film. &quot;Greed&quot; was a critical and financial failure upon its initial release, but, by the 1950s, it began to be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made; filmmakers and scholars have noted its influence on subsequent films. In 1958, the film was voted number 6 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo.

==Plot==
In 1908, John McTeague works in a gold mine in Placer County, California. A traveling dentist calling himself Dr. &quot;Painless&quot; Potter visits the town, and McTeague&#x27;s mother begs Potter to take her son on as an apprentice. Potter agrees and McTeague eventually becomes a dentist, practicing on Polk Street in San Francisco.

Marcus Schouler brings Trina Sieppe, his cousin and intended fiancée, into McTeague&#x27;s office for dental work. Schouler and McTeague are friends and McTeague gladly agrees to examine Trina. As they wait for an opening, she buys a lottery ticket. McTeague becomes enamored with Trina and begs Schouler for permission to court her. After seeing McTeague&#x27;s conviction, Schouler agrees. Trina eventually agrees to marry McTeague and shortly afterwards her lottery ticket wins her $5,000. Schouler bitterly claims that the money should have been his, causing a rift between him and McTeague. After McTeague and Trina wed, they continue to live in their small apartment with Trina refusing to spend her $5,000.

Schouler leaves San Francisco to become a cattle rancher. Before he goes, he secretly, in order to ruin his former friend, reports McTeague for practicing dentistry without a license. McTeague is ordered to shut down his practice or face jail. Even though she has saved over $200 in addition to the original $5,000 from the lottery ticket, Trina is still unwilling to spend her money. Money becomes increasingly scarce, with the couple forced to sell their possessions. McTeague finally snaps and bites Trina&#x27;s fingers in a fit of rage. Later, he goes fishing to earn money, taking Trina&#x27;s savings (now totaling $450).

Trina&#x27;s bitten fingers become infected and have to be amputated. To earn money she becomes a janitor at a children&#x27;s school. She withdraws the $5,000 from the bank to keep it close to her, eventually spreading it on her bed so she can sleep on it. McTeague then returns, having spent the money he took, and asks Trina for more. The following day McTeague confronts Trina at the school. After a heated argument McTeague beats Trina to death and steals her $5,000.

Now an outlaw, McTeague returns to Placer County and teams up with a prospector named Cribbens. Headed towards Death Valley, they find a large quantity of quartz and plan to become millionaires. Before they can begin mining, McTeague senses danger and flees into Death Valley with a single horse, the remaining money and one water jug. Several marshals pursue him, joined by Schouler. Schouler wants to catch McTeague personally and rides into Death Valley alone.

The oppressive heat slows McTeague&#x27;s progress. Schouler&#x27;s progress is also beginning to wane when he spies McTeague and moves in to arrest him. After a confrontation, McTeague&#x27;s horse bolts and Schouler shoots it, puncturing the water container. The water spills onto the desert floor. The pair fight one last time, with McTeague proving the victor; however, Schouler has handcuffed himself to McTeague. Finally, McTeague is left in the desert with no horse and no water, handcuffed to a corpse and unable to reach the remaining money.

===Sub-plots===
Von Stroheim&#x27;s original edit contained two main sub-plots that were later cut. The point of these sub-plots was to contrast two possible outcomes of Trina and McTeague&#x27;s life together. The first depicted the lives of the junkman Zerkow and Maria Miranda Macapa, the young Mexican woman who collects junk for Zerkow and sold Trina the lottery ticket. Maria often talks about her imaginary solid gold dining set with Zerkow, who becomes obsessed by it. Eventually, believing she has riches hidden away, Zerkow marries her. He often asks about it, but she gives a different answer each time he mentions it. Zerkow does not believe her and becomes obsessed with prying the truth from her. He murders her and, after having lost his mind, leaps into San Francisco Bay.

The second sub-plot depicts the lives of Charles W. Grannis and Miss Anastasia Baker. Grannis and Baker are two elderly boarders who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall and listen to the other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as Trina. But this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.

==Production==
===Background and writing===
&quot;Greed&quot; is based on the American author Frank Norris&#x27;s 1899 novel &quot;McTeague: A Story of San Francisco&quot;. Von Stroheim&#x27;s interest in &quot;McTeague&quot; can be traced back to January 1920, when he told a journalist that he wanted to film the novel. He had lived in San Francisco in the early 1910s, living there in poverty like that of the story&#x27;s characters. He eventually moved to Los Angeles, and worked his way up in the film industry from extra to acting in villainous or aristocratic roles in films. By 1919, von Stroheim had finally become a successful director in his own right at Universal Film Manufacturing Company, although one with a reputation of going over budget and over schedule.

Upon the appointment of Irving Thalberg as general manager at Universal, von Stroheim&#x27;s defiance of commercial and industrial norms was no longer tolerated. After Thalberg&#x27;s prior shutdown of &quot;Foolish Wives&quot; in 1921 (which had been shooting nonstop for eleven months), and after six weeks of filming on &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;, von Stroheim was finally fired from the studio on October 6, 1922. This was a step unprecedented in Hollywood, heralding a new era in which the producer and the studio would hold artistic control over actors and directors. However, by this time von Stroheim had received several offers of contracts with other studios, even before being fired from Universal. He had met with executives of the Goldwyn Company on September 14, 1922, less than a month before, and he formally signed with them in late November.
Von Stroheim chose his new studio because of the level of artistic freedom he was offered, which he had been denied at Universal under Thalberg. Since March of that year, Goldwyn had been run by Abe Lehr, who publicly promised that &quot;each director will have his own staff and will be given every facility in putting into production his own individuality and personality.&quot; Von Stroheim signed a one-year, three-feature deal with Goldwyn on November 20, 1922. The deal stipulated that each feature would be between long, cost no more than $175,000 and be completed in fourteen weeks. It also promised von Stroheim $30,000 for each completed film.

Lehr initially hired von Stroheim in order to film a big-budget version of the operetta &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, which the producer saw as a guaranteed hit; von Stroheim, however, convinced Lehr to let him make &quot;Greed&quot; first, promising low costs. A press release of February 1923 said that although von Stroheim had &quot;run rather freely to large sets in the past, [he] seems to have reformed—or surrendered—for it is announced that he will not build any sets at all.&quot;

Von Stroheim wrote a highly detailed 300-page script that contained camera movements, composition and tint cues. Among the changes that he made to Norris&#x27;s novel was giving McTeague the first name of John and omitting Norris&#x27;s anti-Semitism. &quot;McTeague&quot; had been filmed once before as &quot;Life&#x27;s Whirlpool&quot;, a five-reel short by William A. Brady&#x27;s World Pictures, starring Broadway star Holbrook Blinn as McTeague, which had been released in 1916. Film critics disliked this version and von Stroheim later criticized Blinn&#x27;s performance. According to film historian Kevin Brownlow, &quot;Life&#x27;s Whirlpool&quot; was also shot on location in Death Valley.

Von Stroheim was known for his meticulous perfectionism and attention to detail, as well as his insolence towards studio executives. Working on &quot;Greed&quot;, von Stroheim set out to make a realistic film about everyday people and rejected the Hollywood tropes of glamor, happy endings and upper-class characters. Before shooting began, von Stroheim told a reporter:

In early January 1923, von Stroheim arrived in San Francisco, where he scouted locations and finished writing the shooting script. While researching for &quot;Greed&quot;, he attended society functions in town and met many friends of Frank Norris, including his brother Charles and his sister-in-law Kathleen. To capture the authentic spirit of the story, von Stroheim insisted on filming on location in San Francisco, the Sierra Nevada mountains, the Big Dipper Mine in Iowa Hill, and Death Valley. He rented some of the actual buildings that had inspired scenes in the novel. Other locations included Cliff House and San Francisco Bay.

Norris had similarly scouted settings for his novel and chose the upstairs of a building on the corner of Polk and California street as McTeague&#x27;s dentist office, as well as many of the saloons and lunch counters in the area. Von Stroheim discovered that many of the locations that Norris had described, such as Polk Street, had been destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but he was able to find suitable period locations on Hayes and Laguna streets. For authenticity, von Stroheim had no sets built in San Francisco and only redecorated existing locations, such as saloons, butcher shops, and wooden shacks, thus saving on construction costs.

Despite the strict conditions of von Stroheim&#x27;s initial contract, Goldwyn approved the lengthy shooting script before filming began. Production Manager J. J. Cohn later explained that &quot;they thought they could control him when the time comes.&quot;

===Casting===

With the exception of Jean Hersholt, all of the main actors in &quot;Greed&quot; were regulars of von Stroheim&#x27;s earlier films, a group dubbed the &quot;Stroheim Stock Company&quot;. Gibson Gowland had previously appeared in &quot;Blind Husbands&quot; and returned to the U.S. from Scotland for the role of John McTeague. Cesare Gravina, who played the junkman Zerkow, and Dale Fuller, the lottery-ticket seller Maria, had both appeared in &quot;Foolish Wives&quot; and would later appear in &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;. Other actors in von Stroheim&#x27;s Stock Company included Sidney Bracey, Mae Busch, George Fawcett, Maude George, Hughie Mack and George Nichols.

Trina was the most difficult role to cast, and ZaSu Pitts was hired at the last minute, after von Stroheim had rejected both Claire Windsor and Colleen Moore. Pitts had previously acted only in comedic roles; &quot;Greed&quot; was her first dramatic part. The actress later appeared in both &quot;The Wedding March&quot; and &quot;Hello, Sister!&quot; Von Stroheim said that Pitts was &quot;the greatest psychopathological actress in the American cinema&quot; and that &quot;she should not be in comedy, for she is the greatest of all tragediennes.&quot;

Von Stroheim had met casually with Jean Hersholt to discuss the role of Marcus Schouler, but he was initially reluctant to cast him. However, after Hersholt adjusted his appearance and wardrobe to more closely resemble Schouler, von Stroheim changed his mind on the spot. With the exception of Gowland, von Stroheim shot extensive screen tests of all the other actors at Goldwyn with cinematographer Paul Ivano. A scene from the Goldwyn film &quot;Souls for Sale&quot; is thought to be behind-the-scenes footage of von Stroheim directing &quot;Greed&quot;, but it actually depicts him directing Hersholt during one of these screen tests.

===Filming===
Filming commenced in San Francisco on March 13, 1923 and concluded in October, for a total of 198 days, producing about 85 hours of footage. The San Francisco location shooting wrapped in late June. Despite the initial contract between von Stroheim and Goldwyn, Lehr agreed to double the film&#x27;s budget to $347,000 three days after shooting began. Von Stroheim had already worked twenty-hour days for over two months of pre-production and collapsed on set after a few days of filming. He remained in good health for the remainder of the shoot. This was not the only mishap on set; during scenes shot at San Francisco Bay, Cesare Gravina developed double pneumonia, making von Stroheim bitterly ashamed that Gravina&#x27;s entire performance was later cut from the film, despite the actor&#x27;s dedication to the role. Hersholt was knocked unconscious by Gowland during the picnic scene (later cut) in which McTeague and Schouler fight, and Pitts was nearly run over by a trolley. In late May, Lehr visited von Stroheim on the set and praised the footage that he had seen, saying that &quot;it has atmosphere, color and realism that could not possibly have been reproduced in the studio.&quot;

One scene that von Stroheim re-shot at the studio&#x27;s insistence depicted a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is too embarrassed to examine the teeth of a young woman and Potter has to take over. A thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the audience would see a resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it. Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director wanted to have a knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gowland&#x27;s head; Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to participate in such a dangerous stunt. A special-effect shot was created instead.
After filming in San Francisco finished in June, the production traveled to Death Valley. Most Hollywood films that required desert scenes settled for the local Oxnard dunes north of Los Angeles, but von Stroheim insisted on authenticity. Death Valley had no roads, hotels, services or running water and was teeming with tarantulas, scorpions, rattlesnakes and black widow spiders. The nearest populated area to the shoot was around away and insurance coverage was denied. Filming in Death Valley lasted through July and August, 1923. Both Gowland and Hersholt grew beards necessary for the sequence. During production, the highest temperature officially recorded in Death Valley was . Of the forty-three members of the cast and crew who worked on the Death Valley sequence, one cook died of heatstroke and fourteen others became ill and were sent back to Los Angeles Heat exhaustion was a daily occurrence for members of the crew. Hersholt spent a week in the hospital after shooting was completed, suffering from internal bleeding. He claimed to have lost , and was covered in blisters due to severe sunburn by the end of filming. Despite the hardship, Hersholt later stated that he considered his role in &quot; Greed&quot; to be the best of his career. In order to motivate Hersholt and Gibson during the scene where they fight, von Stroheim yelled at them, &quot;Fight, fight! Try to hate each other as much as you both hate me!&quot; Throughout filming, von Stroheim brought musicians on set to help create the appropriate mood for the actors. He continued to use this for the Death Valley scenes with a harmonium and violin player. A theme, inspired by the music of Italian operatic composer Ruggero Leoncavallo, was composed and played throughout production. Other music included the popular songs &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot;, &quot;Hearts and Flowers&quot;, &quot;Oh Promise Me&quot;, and &quot;Call Me Thine Own&quot;.

Filming moved to Placer County on September 13 and continued for less than a month. The Big Dipper Mine had been closed for ten years, so von Stroheim convinced the Goldwyn Company to lease and renovate it for filming. While first visiting Placer County during pre-production, von Stroheim had met Harold Henderson, a local resident and fan of Norris whose brother had worked in the mine in the 1890s. Von Stroheim hired Henderson to oversee the renovation of the mine and other locations in Iowa Hill. Von Stroheim also wanted to restore the local cemetery for a newly written scene depicting McTeague&#x27;s mother&#x27;s funeral, but the Goldwyn Company turned down this proposal. Inside the mine, von Stroheim usually shot at night between 9 pm and 6 am. Cinematographer William H. Daniels later said that von Stroheim insisted on descending underground for realism, even though the setting would have looked exactly the same at . Filming of &quot;Greed&quot; was completed on October 6, 1923, after 198 days. Despite his original contract stipulating that all films be under , von Stroheim shot a total of of footage for the film, running approximately 85 hours.

===Style===

Von Stroheim&#x27;s biographer Arthur Lennig compared the director&#x27;s visual style to that of pioneering filmmaker D. W. Griffith, but felt that &quot;unlike Griffith, who viewed scenes as though through a fourth wall, von Stroheim shot from many sides and from different angles; he also used deep focus, meaningful foregrounds and effective camera movement.&quot; &quot;Greed&quot;″s lighting included high contrast, chiaroscuro techniques with pools or shafts of lights illuminating an otherwise dark space. Examples of this technique include the scene where McTeague begs Trina for money in a pool of moonlight and the merry-go-round scene in which characters alternate between appearing only as dark silhouettes and being fully lit.

Daniels was especially proud of the wedding scene, which has a funeral procession visible through the window and was difficult to light properly. &quot;Greed&quot; has often been praised for its use of deep focus cinematography, seventeen years before its more-famous application in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Daniels sometimes used incandescent lights instead of studio arc lights, due to the constraints of his locations. He later said that von Stroheim &quot;was one of the first to insist on no make-up for men, on real paint on the walls which were shiny, real glass in the windows, pure white on sets and in costumes  ... everything up to then had been painted a dull brown&quot; to mask the scratches on worn-down film prints. Although not officially credited, Ernest B. Schoedsack worked on the picture as a camera operator.

Von Stroheim favored &quot;Soviet-style&quot; montage editing. &quot;Greed&quot; often uses dramatic close-ups and cuts instead of long takes. One exception to this is the scene in which Schouler becomes angry with McTeague and breaks his pipe, which was shot in one long, unbroken take. Von Stroheim also used symbolic cross-cutting for dramatic effect, such as his use of animals in the film and a shot of a train when McTeague and Trina first kiss. In 1932 film theorist Andrew Buchanan called von Stroheim a montage director, stating that &quot;each observation would be captured in a &#x27;close-up&#x27; and at leisure, he would assemble his &#x27;shots&#x27; in just the order which would most forcibly illustrate the fact.&quot; In the 1950s film critic André Bazin praised von Stroheim&#x27;s use of &quot;mise en scène&quot; and noted his &quot;one simple rule for directing. Take a close look at the world, keep on doing so and in the end it will lay bare for you all its cruelty and ugliness.&quot;

Despite von Stroheim&#x27;s reputation as a perfectionist, &quot;Greed&quot; contains several anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Von Stroheim did his best to avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only those buildings that were from the era &quot;Greed&quot; was set in, and he kept motor vehicles out of sight while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for authenticity, von Stroheim sometimes had walls knocked out of real locations to achieve a desired camera position.

===Themes===

Frank Norris&#x27;s novel belongs to the literary school of naturalism founded by French author Émile Zola. &quot;McTeague&quot; depicts the fate of its lower-class characters in terms of heredity and their environment, with the belief that &quot;man&#x27;s nature, despite free will, is determined by genetic and environmental factors&quot; and that heredity controls fate, despite efforts at upward mobility. This literary style was influenced by Charles Darwin and portrayed characters whose higher states of being, the rational and compassionate, are in conflict with their lower states, the &quot;bête humaine&quot; (human beast). &quot;McTeague&quot; was first published in 1899 and was inspired by an October 1893 murder case in which Patrick Collins, a poor husband with a history of beating his wife Sarah, finally stole her money and stabbed her to death at her San Francisco workplace. Sarah Collins worked at the Lest Norris kindergarten, which was financed by Norris&#x27;s family.

Von Stroheim did not see &quot;Greed&quot; as political and told a journalist that he considered it to be like a Greek tragedy. Despite the characters&#x27; struggles with poverty and class, von Stroheim followed the naturalist technique of portraying characters whose lives are driven by fate and their inner nature. Von Stroheim employed variations of this theme in his other films, which often involved a commoner falling in love with an aristocrat or royal.

One of the cinematic techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In &quot;Greed&quot; McTeague is associated with a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris&#x27;s original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual &quot;leitmotif&quot;. For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.

Throughout his career von Stroheim used grotesque imagery and characters. This is most apparent in the wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity and a sense of communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina&#x27;s fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.

As in his other films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often depicted in von Stroheim&#x27;s films and was close to the date of his father&#x27;s death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague&#x27;s father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim&#x27;s own father, while McTeague&#x27;s mother is a tribute to von Stroheim&#x27;s mother, to whom &quot;Greed&quot; is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.

==Editing==

===Initial editing===

Editing &quot;Greed&quot; took almost a year and von Stroheim&#x27;s contract did not include payment for his post-production work. He and his chief film cutter Frank Hull worked on the film for several months before completing a rough cut. Von Stroheim was indecisive during editing. He felt restricted by his contract&#x27;s limitation on the length of the film. Von Stroheim colored certain scenes with gold tinting by using the Handschiegl Color Process, in which individual frames are hand colored with stencils. Von Stroheim credited himself in the beginning titles with &quot;Personally directed by Erich von Stroheim.&quot;

Other than studio personnel, only twelve people saw the original 42-reel version of &quot;Greed&quot; at a special screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made and that it was unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he &quot;saw a wonderful picture the other day—that no one else will ever see  ... I can&#x27;t imagine what they are going to do with it. It is like &quot;Les Miserables&quot;. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don&#x27;t know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague&#x27;s building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette&#x27;s &quot;Out 1&quot;. Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared &quot;Greed&quot; to &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; and &quot;Dr. Mabuse the Gambler&quot;. However, Welford Beaton of &quot;The Film Spectator&quot; disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.

Many sources claim that the 42-reel version was only ever intended to be a rough cut, and that Von Stroheim chose to cut it down to 24 reels by March 18, 1924, with the intention of screening it with intermissions over two nights. The director had difficulty cutting the film down, telling his friend Don Ryan, &quot;I could take out sequences and thus get the job over in a day. That would be child&#x27;s play. But I can&#x27;t do it. It would leave gaps that could only be bridged through titles. When you do such a thing you have illustrated subtitles instead of a motion picture.&quot; Von Stroheim later claimed that at this time the Goldwyn Company wanted him to shoot a scene of McTeague waking up in his dentist chair, showing the entire film to have been a bad dream. While von Stroheim was editing the 24-reel cut June Mathis, who was the head of the Goldwyn Story Department, had made her own 13-reel version of &quot;Greed&quot; by January 21, 1924. She ordered even more cuts to be made on January 29, but then left for Rome in early February to oversee the production of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and was uninvolved in the film&#x27;s editing for several months.

After having completed the 24-reel cut of &quot;Greed&quot;, von Stroheim told Goldwyn executives that he could not cut another frame. Goldwyn producers thought that this version was still too long and told him to cut it to a more manageable length. Von Stroheim then sent the film to his friend, director Rex Ingram, who turned it over to his editor, Grant Whytock. Whytock had worked with von Stroheim on &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Pass Key&quot; and was familiar with the director&#x27;s style and tastes. Whytock initially proposed that it be split in two, with one 8-reel film ending with the wedding and a second 7-reel film ending at Death Valley. Whytock eventually cut the film down to 18 reels. His only major cut was the entire subplot of Zerkow and Maria, which he thought was &quot;very distasteful&quot;. Otherwise he simply cut down scenes and cut out of quick &quot;flash&quot; shots that only lasted a few frames. However, Whytock&#x27;s version of &quot;Greed&quot; retained the prologue and other subplots, as well as much of the humor that was later cut out of it.

Whytock and Ingram screened their version of &quot;Greed&quot; to studio executives, who responded favorably to it but worried that the tragic ending would be hard to sell to the public. Ingram then sent the 18-reel version to von Stroheim and told him, &quot;If you cut one more frame I shall never speak to you again.&quot; On April 10, 1924, the Goldwyn Company officially agreed to merge with Metro Pictures, putting von Stroheim&#x27;s nemesis Thalberg directly in charge of &quot;Greed&quot;. Von Stroheim and Louis B. Mayer had a lengthy confrontation over the film&#x27;s editing, which according to both men ended with von Stroheim claiming that all women were whores and Mayer punching him. Mayer disliked the film because of its lack of glamor, optimism, or morality and considered it to be a guaranteed flop.

===Studio editing===

MGM executives screened &quot;Greed&quot; at full length once to meet contractual obligations. Idwal Jones, a San Francisco critic, attended the all-day screening and wrote that while some of the scenes were compelling, von Stroheim&#x27;s desire that &quot;every comma of the book [be] put in&quot; was ultimately negative. MGM then took control and re-edited it. The studio ordered June Mathis to cut it down further; she assigned the job to Joseph W. Farnham, a well-known &quot;titles editor&quot;, who patched scenes together using title cards to keep continuity. His contributions to &quot;Greed&quot; include the notorious title cards &quot;&quot;Such was McTeague&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s go over and sit on the sewer&quot;&quot;, which were snickered at for years. Eventually, Farnham reduced &quot;Greed&quot; to 10 reels, totaling . Von Stroheim said that the film &quot;was cut by a hack with nothing on his mind but his hat.&quot; He later bitterly lamented that &quot;Greed&quot; was made before the financial success of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s five-hour play &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; in 1928. Von Stroheim angrily disowned the final version, blaming Mathis for destroying his masterpiece.

One week before &quot;Greed&quot;″s release the New York State Motion Picture Committee (which censored films) demanded several more cuts on moral grounds. These cuts included the administration of ether in the dental scenes and certain instances of foul language. Although these cuts were made to prints that were screened in New York State, the footage was kept in many other prints.

===Difference between von Stroheim&#x27;s cut and MGM&#x27;s cut===

The main cuts to &quot;Greed&quot; were the elimination of its two sub-plots and other entire sequences, while individual scenes were often not touched. Commenting about the cuts made in the film to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Thalberg stated:
Thalberg also stated that he &quot;took no chances in cutting it. We took it around to different theaters in the suburbs, ran it at its enormous length, and then we took note of the places at which interest seemed to droop.&quot;

Individual scenes or sequences that were cut include McTeague and Trina&#x27;s early, happy years of marriage, the sequence showing McTeague and Trina eventually moving into their shack, the family life of the Sieppe family before Trina&#x27;s marriage, the prologue depicting McTeague&#x27;s mother and father at the Big Dipper mine and McTeague&#x27;s apprenticeship. Other cuts included the more suggestive and sexual close-up shots depicting McTeague and Trina&#x27;s physical attraction to each other, the scenes after McTeague has murdered Trina and roams around San Francisco and Placer County, additional footage of Death Valley, additional footage of Trina with her money, and a more gradual version of Trina&#x27;s descent into greed and miserly obsession.

==Reception==

===Release and critical reviews===
&quot;Greed&quot; premiered on December 4, 1924, at the Cosmopolitan Theatre in Columbus Circle, New York City, which was owned by William Randolph Hearst. Frank Norris had once worked for Hearst as a foreign correspondent during the Spanish–American War and Hearst praised &quot;Greed&quot;, calling it the greatest film he had ever seen. Hearst&#x27;s newspapers promoted the film, but MGM did very little advertising. At the time of the release von Stroheim was in Los Angeles, having begun production on &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; on December 1. In May 1926 &quot;Greed&quot; was released in Berlin, where its premiere famously caused a riot at the theater that may have been instigated by members of the then-fledgling Nazi party.

&quot;Greed&quot; received mostly negative reviews. The trade paper &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Report&quot; said that &quot;[i]f a contest were to be held to determine which has been the filthiest, vilest, most putrid picture in the history of the motion picture business, I am sure that &quot;Greed&quot; would win.&quot; &quot;Variety Weekly&quot; called it &quot;an out-and-out box office flop&quot; only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that &quot;nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time&quot; and that despite its &quot;excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story  ... it does not entertain.&quot; In its December 1924 – January 1925 issue, &quot;Exceptional Photoplays&quot; called it &quot;one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. But the point is that it was never intended to be a pleasant picture.&quot; In the February 1925 issue of &quot;Theatre Magazine&quot;, Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that &quot;the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types—they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism.&quot; Mordaunt Hall of the &quot;New York Times&quot; gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM &quot;clipped this production as much as they dared  ... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use the scissors more generously in the beginning.&quot; In a &quot;Life Magazine&quot; article, Robert E. Sherwood also defended MGM&#x27;s cutting of the film and called von Stroheim &quot;a genius  ... badly in need of a stopwatch.&quot; Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying &quot;a not very pleasing yellow tinge is smudged in.&quot; A March 1925 review in &quot;Pictureplay&quot; magazine stated, &quot;perhaps an American director would not have seen greed as a vice.&quot;

A more favorable review came from Richard Watts, Jr. of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, who called &quot;Greed&quot; &quot;the most important picture yet produced in America  ... It is the one picture of the season that can hold its own as a work of dramatic art worthy of comparison with such stage plays as &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; and &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot;.&quot; The April 20, 1925 edition of &quot;The Montreal Gazette&quot; claimed it &quot;impresses as a powerful film&quot; and described the &quot;capacity audience&quot; screening as &quot;one of the few pictures which are as worthy of serious consideration ... which offer a real and convincing study of life and character and that secure their ends by artistic and intellectual means rather than by writing down to the level of the groundlings.&quot; The review went on to describe the direction as &quot;masterly&quot;, citing &quot;its remarkable delineation of character development and the subtle touches which convey ideas through vision rather than the written word, an all too-rare employment of the possibilities of the cinema play as a distinct branch of art capable of truthful and convincing revelation and interpretation of life&#x27;s realities.&quot; A review in &quot;Exceptional Photoplays&quot; stated that &quot;Mr. von Stroheim has always been the realist as Rex Ingram is the romanticist and Griffith the sentimentalist of the screen, and in &quot;Greed&quot; he has given us an example of realism at its starkest. Like the novel from which the plot was taken, &quot;Greed&quot; is a terrible and wonderful thing.&quot;

===Box office===

&quot;Greed&quot; was a financial disappointment. On its initial run, it earned $224,500 in the United States, $3,063 in Canada and $47,264 in other markets. In total it earned $274,827. Von Stroheim&#x27;s biographer Arthur Lennig stated that according to MGM&#x27;s records the final cost of &quot;Greed&quot; was $546,883. Another biographer, Richard Koszarski, stated that its final cost was $665,603: $585,250 for the production, $30,000 for von Stroheim&#x27;s personal fee, $54,971 for processing and editing, $53,654 for advertising and $1,726 for Motion Picture dues.

Arthur Lennig asserted that MGM&#x27;s official budget for &quot;Greed&quot; was suspiciously high for a film with no stars, no built sets, a small crew and inexpensive film stock. Lennig suspects that MGM averaged the film&#x27;s cost with the more expensive &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; in order to prevent von Stroheim from getting a percentage of the more profitable film. &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; ended up being a hit and earned more profits than &quot;Greed&quot; had lost; it cost $614,961 but earned $996,226 on its initial run.

==Legacy==

In his final years, von Stroheim said that &quot;of all my films, only &quot;Greed&quot; was a fully realized work; only &quot;Greed&quot; had a total validity.&quot; In 1926 a British foundation of arts and sciences requested a copy of the original version of &quot;Greed&quot; to keep in their archive, but their request was denied by MGM. Henri Langlois screened the studio version of &quot;Greed&quot; for von Stroheim in 1950. Von Stroheim said, &quot;It was for me an exhumation. It was like opening a coffin in which there was just dust, giving off a terrible stench, a couple of vertebra and a piece of shoulder bone.&quot; He went on to say that &quot;It was as if a man&#x27;s beloved was run over by a truck, maimed beyond recognition. He goes to see her in the morgue. Of course, he still loves her but it&#x27;s only the memory of her that he can love—because he doesn&#x27;t recognize her anymore.&quot;

In the early 1950s &quot;Greed&quot;″s reputation began to grow and it appeared on several lists of the greatest films ever made. In 1952 at the &quot;Festival Mondial du Film et des Beaux Arts de Belgique&quot;, &quot;Greed&quot; was named the fifth greatest film ever made, with such directors as Luchino Visconti, Orson Welles, Luis Buñuel and Billy Wilder voting for it. Later in 1952, &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; magazine published its first list of the &quot;ten greatest films ever made&quot;. &quot;Greed&quot; was tied for 7th place on that list, with such critics as Andre Bazin, Lotte Eisner, Curtis Harrington, Penelope Houston and Gavin Lambert voting for it. In 1962 it was tied for 4th on the same list. Since 1972 it has failed to reach a spot on the top ten. The &quot;Cinémathèque royale de Belgique&quot; released a list of &quot;the most important and misappreciated American films of all time&quot; in 1978. &quot;Greed&quot; was third on its list after &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In a University of Southern California list of the &quot;50 Most Significant American Films&quot; made by the school&#x27;s Performing Arts Council, &quot;Greed&quot; was listed as number 21. In 1991 &quot;Greed&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2020, the film&#x27;s copyright lapsed, entering into the public domain.

===Influence===
Among those who have praised &quot;Greed&quot; over the years are Sergei Eisenstein; Joseph von Sternberg, who said, &quot;We were all influenced by &quot;Greed&quot;&quot;; Jean Renoir, who called it &quot;the film of films&quot;; and Ernst Lubitsch, who called von Stroheim &quot;the only true &#x27;novelist&#x27;&quot; in films. More recently Guillermo del Toro called it &quot;a perfect reflection of the anxiety permeating the passage into the 20th century and the absolute dehumanization that was to come&quot;, and Norbert Pfaffenbichler said that &quot;the last shot of the movie is unforgettable.&quot; American writer and critic Susan Sontag named &quot;Greed&quot; one of her favorite films. Jonathan Rosenbaum has stated that &quot;Greed&quot; was a major influence on the style and content of many films. Von Stroheim&#x27;s shots filming the sun predated Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s better-known uses of the technique in &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950). Rosenbaum compared specific shot set-ups in &quot;Greed&quot; to shots in King Vidor&#x27;s &quot;The Crowd&quot;, Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;Le Crime de Monsieur Lange&quot;, Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;, Howard Hawks&#x27; &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; and Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot;. In addition, he likened certain plot elements or characters in &quot;Greed&quot; to John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948), Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), Claude Chabrol&#x27;s &quot;Les Bonnes Femmes&quot; (1960) and Elaine May&#x27;s &quot;Mikey and Nicky&quot; (1975). Rosenbaum singled out von Stroheim&#x27;s influence on May, an American director, with &quot;Mikey and Nicky&quot; centering on the disintegration of a friendship over money and sex, and including grotesque elements and characters caught between innocence and corruption. Rosenbaum also asserts that Orson Welles&#x27;s use of satirical caricatures in all of his films is in &quot;the spirit of von Stroheim&quot;.

The two films most commonly compared to &quot;Greed&quot; are Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; and Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;. Rosenbaum believes that besides Huston&#x27;s film ending with gold being lost in the desert and similarities between Trina&#x27;s descent into madness with Fred C. Dobbs own obsessions, the two films have little else in common. &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; and &quot;Greed&quot; both have characters who struggle with class differences that lead to their downfall. &quot;Ambersons&quot; was famously edited down drastically by its studio and the cut footage is now lost. Rosenbaum goes on to state that &quot;Greed&quot; influenced the methods in which novels are adapted into films and filmmakers like Welles, Huston and Bill Forsyth followed von Stroheim&#x27;s example by re-arranging the plot and adding new scenes to their films while still remaining faithful to the intentions of the original novels. In the first chapter of the 1966 serial film &quot;Captain Celluloid vs. the Film Pirates&quot;, the uncut version of &quot;Greed&quot; is used as a plot device. The 1994 Jonathan Lynn film &quot;Greedy&quot; pays tribute to the film by giving the main characters the last name McTeague.

===Reconstruction===
Attempts to reconstruct the uncut version of &quot;Greed&quot; without use of the lost footage first began in 1958. At the Brussels International Exposition, the &quot;Cinémathèque royale de Belgique&quot; named &quot;Greed&quot; as one of the twelve greatest films ever made and simultaneously published von Stroheim&#x27;s original, uncut script for &quot;Greed&quot;, which came directly from von Stroheim&#x27;s personal copy preserved by his widow Denise Vernac. This publication led to three separate books that all used von Stroheim&#x27;s script in order to reconstruct the original version of the film and compare it to the released version: a French book edited by Jacques-G. Perret in 1968 and two versions edited by Joel Finler and Herman G. Weinberg, both in 1972. Weinberg&#x27;s book utilized 400 individual stills and production photos to reconstruct the uncut version of &quot;Greed&quot;, the first time that images from the uncut version were publicly available.

In 1999, Turner Entertainment decided to recreate, as closely as possible, the original version by combining the existing footage with over 650 still photographs of the lost scenes (many of which had been used in Weinberg&#x27;s book), in accordance with an original continuity outline written by von Stroheim. All materials were provided by the Margaret Herrick Library. This restoration runs almost four hours. It was produced by film preservationist Rick Schmidlin and edited by Glenn Morgan. Schmidlin restored many characters and sub-plots from the original version. A new musical score was composed by Robert Israel. The reconstruction cost $100,000 to produce. Schmidlin called the finished product &quot;a reconstruction of Von Stroheim&#x27;s lost narrative.&quot; It premiered at the 1999 Telluride Film Festival and was later screened at the Venice Film Festival and the Pordenone Silent Film Festival before being aired on Turner Classic Movies on December 5, 1999. Film critic Todd McCarthy called the restored version of &quot;Greed&quot; a triumph. Roger Ebert called &quot;Greed&quot; a masterpiece and said that the restored Schmidlin cut illustrates the &quot;prudish sensibilities [that] went into MGM&#x27;s chop job.&quot; Rosenbaum praised the project, but claimed it could only be considered a &quot;study version&quot;. The reconstruction won a special citation from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards.

==Myths and misconceptions==

Von Stroheim was known to exaggerate events from his life and create myths about himself, such as his fictitious aristocratic origins and spurious military record in Austria. He claimed that shortly after having moved to the US in the early 1910s, he had found a copy of &quot;McTeague&quot; in a motel in New York and had read it in one sitting. He also said that wanting to adapt the book inspired him to make a career in filmmaking. Georges Sadoul later stated that von Stroheim had first read the novel in 1914, while living in poverty in Los Angeles.

Claims that von Stroheim&#x27;s original cut was a completely unabridged version of &quot;McTeague&quot; are not accurate. Von Stroheim&#x27;s 300-page script was almost as long as the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague&#x27;s back story in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In von Stroheim&#x27;s original &quot;Greed&quot;, this sequence took up the first hour of the film and was not a flashback. Von Stroheim also modernized the novel&#x27;s time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.

&quot;Greed&quot; has sometimes been said to be over 100 reels long. Von Stroheim said that his initial edit was 42 reels, although several of the people who saw this cut remembered it as being anywhere from 42 to 47 reels. Grant Whytock remembered the edited version that von Stroheim initially sent to him as between 26 and 28 reels. MGM&#x27;s official studio files list the original cut of the film at 22 reels. As recently as 1992, former MGM Story Editor Samuel Marx erroneously claimed that the original version of &quot;Greed&quot; was 70 reels.

June Mathis is credited with co-writing the script due to her work on the 10-reel version. Mathis was the head of the Story Department at MGM and her contract stipulated that she would receive writing credit for all MGM films. She did not actually write any part of the screenplay. Mathis is said to have changed the film&#x27;s title from &quot;McTeague&quot; to &quot;Greed&quot; during post-production; however, a publicity still of the cast and crew taken during production clearly indicates that the FIM was titled &quot;Greed&quot; before the MGM merger even took place. The film&#x27;s working title was &quot;Greedy Wives&quot;, a nod towards von Stroheim&#x27;s previous film &quot;Foolish Wives&quot;; this working title never was considered as the film&#x27;s actual title.

The original, uncut version of &quot;Greed&quot; has been called the &quot;holy grail&quot; for film archivists. Over the years, various reports of the original version being uncovered have proven to be unfounded. Among them is a claim that a copy existed in a vault in South America that was screened once a year for invited guests on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Another claim was that a copy in the possession of a millionaire Texan was sold to Henri Langlois of &quot;Cinémathèque Française&quot;. A film society in Boston supposedly held a private screening of a print discovered by a World War II veteran in Berlin. Yet another claim is that David Shepherd of the American Film Institute had found a copy at a garage sale, and that the head of a film society in Redwood City, California owned &quot;the longest existing version of &quot;Greed&quot; (purchased in Europe).&quot; Von Stroheim himself once stated that Benito Mussolini owned a personal copy of the film. Von Stroheim&#x27;s son Joseph von Stroheim once claimed that when he was in the Army during World War II, he saw a version of the film that took two nights to fully screen, although he could not remember exactly how long it was.

There were also several reports that MGM had retained a copy of the original version. Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art claimed that a copy was locked in the MGM vaults, although Thalberg denied it. It was also reported that John Houseman had a private screening at MGM and that the studio owned two copies stored in a vault in a Utah salt mine. Lotte Eisner once claimed that sometime in the 1950s and 1960s, several film cans labeled &quot;McTeague&quot; were found in MGM&#x27;s vaults and destroyed by executives who did not know that it was footage from &quot;Greed&quot;. MGM executive Al Lewin said that several years after the film&#x27;s release, von Stroheim asked him for the cut footage; Lewin and editor Margaret Booth supposedly searched MGM&#x27;s vault but could not find any missing footage.

<text>Philippicus (; ) was Byzantine emperor from 711 to 713. He took power in a coup against the unpopular emperor Justinian II, and was deposed in a similarly violent manner nineteen months later. During his brief reign, Philippicus supported monothelitism in Byzantine theological disputes, and saw conflict with the First Bulgarian Empire and the Umayyad Caliphate.

==Biography==
Philippicus was originally named Bardanes (; ); he was the son of the patrician Nicephorus, who was of Armenian extraction from an Armenian colony in Pergamum. The Armenian background of Philippicus has been supported by Byzantinist historians Peter Charanis and Nicholas Adontz, and disputed by Anthony Kaldellis. Kaldellis adds that Bardanes was probably born and raised in the Byzantine realm, as his father Nicephorus possibly was. Contemporaneous sources attest to Bardanes&#x27; tutoring, scholarly interests, learning and eloquence, all of which were in Greek. Byzantine historians Leslie Brubaker and John Haldon suggested Bardanes had some connection or affiliation with the Armenian Mamikonian family, which Kaldellis also denies. Byzantine researcher Toby Bromige felt Kaldellis was too dismissive of the Armenian ancestry of certain Byzantine individuals. 

Relying on the support of the Monothelite party, he made some pretensions to the throne on the outbreak of the first great rebellion against Emperor Justinian II. Instead, the position of emperor was taken first by Leontius and then by Tiberius III, who relegated Bardanes to Cephalonia. When Justinian regained power Bardanes was banished to Cherson, where he took the name Philippicus and incited the inhabitants to revolt with the help of the Khazars. The successful rebels drove Justinian out of Constantinople, and Philippicus took the throne. Justinian was subsequently seized and beheaded; his son Tiberius was likewise apprehended by Philippicus&#x27;s officers, Ioannes and Mauros, and killed in a church. Justinian&#x27;s principal officers, such as Barasbakourios, were also massacred. 
===Reign===
Among the first acts of Philippicus were the deposition of Cyrus (the orthodox patriarch of Constantinople) in favour of John VI (a member of his own sect), and the summoning of a conciliabulum of Eastern bishops, which abolished the canons of the Sixth Ecumenical Council. In response, the Roman Church refused to recognize the new emperor and his patriarch. Meanwhile, the Bulgarian ruler Tervel plundered up to the walls of Constantinople in 712. When Philippicus transferred an army from the Opsikion theme to police the Balkans, the Umayyad Caliphate under Al-Walid I made inroads across the weakened defenses of Asia Minor.

In late May 713 the Opsikion troops rebelled in Thrace. Several of their officers penetrated the city and blinded Philippicus on June 3, 713 while he was in the hippodrome. He was succeeded for a short while by his principal secretary, Artemius, who was raised to the purple as Emperor Anastasius II. He died in the same year.

<doc id="73937" wikidata="Q783258" url="?curid=73937" title="Gun Crazy">
<text>Gun Crazy (also known as Deadly Is the Female) is a 1950 American crime film noir starring Peggy Cummins and John Dall in a story about the crime-spree of a gun-toting husband and wife. It was directed by Joseph H. Lewis, and produced by Frank and Maurice King.

The screenplay by blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo (credited to Millard Kaufman because of the blacklist) and MacKinlay Kantor was based upon a short story by Kantor published in 1940 in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. In 1998, &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
Teenager Barton &quot;Bart&quot; Tare gets caught breaking a hardware store window to steal a gun. He is sent to reform school for four years despite the supportive testimony of his friends Dave and Clyde, his older sister Ruby and others. They claim he would never kill any living creature, even though he has had a fascination with guns even as a child. Flashbacks provide a portrait of Bart who, after killing a young chick with a BB gun at age seven, is hesitant to shoot at anything, even a mountain lion with a bounty on its head. However, he is a dead shot with a handgun.

After reform school and a stint in the Army teaching marksmanship, Bart returns home. He, Dave, and Clyde go to a traveling carnival in town. Once there, Bart challenges sharpshooter Annie Laurie Starr (&quot;Laurie&quot;) to a contest and wins. She gets him a job with the carnival and he becomes smitten with her. Their mutual attraction inflames the jealousy of their boss, Packett, who wants her for himself. When Packett tries to force himself on her, Bart fires a warning shot within an inch of his nose. Packet fires the couple, who leave together. Before they marry, Laurie warns Bart that she is &quot;bad, but will try to be good&quot;. They embark on a carefree honeymoon on Bart&#x27;s savings. When the money runs out, she gives Bart a stark choice: she wants to obtain the good things in life, so he must join her in a career of crime or she will leave him. They hold up stores and gas stations, but the paltry take does not last long.

While fleeing a police car Laurie tells Bart to shoot at the driver so they can escape, but he hesitates and becomes disoriented. Ultimately, he shoots the tire out and the car crashes. Later that day, at another robbery, Laurie intends to shoot and kill a grocer, but Bart stops her in time. The couple have now been identified in national newspapers as notorious robbers.

Bart says he is done with a life of crime. Laurie persuades him to take on one last big robbery so they can flee the country and live in peace and comfort. They get jobs at a meat processing plant and make detailed plans. When they hold up the payroll department, the office manager pulls the burglar alarm and Laurie shoots her dead. While fleeing the plant, Laurie also kills a security guard. Bart does not realize at the time that both victims are dead, but learns about it later from a newspaper. Laurie then discloses she shot a man dead in St. Louis while she and Packett were attempting a hold-up. She claims that these murders happened because her fear makes her unable to think straight in the moment.

To minimize the chances of being caught, the two decide to split up for a couple of months, but neither can bear to be away from the other. The FBI is brought in, and the fugitives become the targets of an intense manhunt.

In California, Bart arranges for passage to Mexico, when the FBI finds them in a dance hall. Forced to run, they leave all their loot behind. With roadblocks everywhere, they jump on a train and get off near Ruby&#x27;s house. Clyde, then the local sheriff, notices that the house has the curtains drawn and the children are not in school. He informs Dave, and the two plead with Bart to give himself and Laurie up. Instead, the couple flee into the mountains. Pursued by police dogs, they are surrounded in reed grass the next morning. In dense fog, Dave and Clyde approach to try to reason with them. As soon as Bart sees Laurie preparing to gun them down, he shoots her and is, in turn, killed by the police.

==Production==
The screenplay was credited to Kantor and Millard Kaufman; however, Kaufman was a front for Hollywood Ten outcast Dalton Trumbo, who considerably reworked the story into a doomed love affair.

The film was budgeted at $400,000, and principal photography took 30 days.

The picture originally was slated to be released by Monogram Studios. However, King Brothers Productions, the producers, chose United Artists as the distributor. &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; enjoyed wider exposure because it was a United Artists release.

The King Brothers originally announced they wanted Veronica Lake for the lead.

In an interview with Danny Peary, director Joseph H. Lewis revealed his instructions to actors John Dall and Peggy Cummins: 
:I told John, &quot;Your cock&#x27;s never been so hard&quot;, and I told Peggy, &quot;You&#x27;re a female dog in heat, and you want him. But don&#x27;t let him have it in a hurry. Keep him waiting.&quot; That&#x27;s exactly how I talked to them and I turned them loose. I didn&#x27;t have to give them more directions.

The bank heist sequence was shot entirely in one long take in Montrose, California, with no one besides the principal actors and people inside the bank alerted to the operation. This one-take shot includes the sequence of driving into town to the bank, distracting and then knocking out a patrolman, and making the get-away. This was done by simulating the interior of a sedan with a stretch Cadillac with room enough to mount the camera and a jockey&#x27;s saddle for the cameraman on a greased two-by-twelve board in the back. Lewis kept the onscreen conversations fresh by having the actors improvise their dialogue.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

The New York Times wrote: “Even with some adroit camouflaging, the Palace’s new picture...is pretty cheap stuff. ‘Gun Crazy’ just about covers it...this spurious concoction is basically on par with the most humdrum pulp fiction...In all fairness to Mr. Kantor’s idea, the actual script, which he wrote with Millard Kuafman, is a fairly literature business. Even if the young desperadoes aren’t motivated, apparently beyond Miss Cummins’ grim appreciation of money and her partner’s general restlessness, neither are they sentimentalized or offered as luckless tools of society. The dialogue is quite good and the photography is first-rate...The main drawbacks are the stars themselves, who look more like fugitives from a 4-H Club than from the law. Just why two such clean-cut youngsters...should be so cast is something for the Sphinx, but they certainly give it the works. Looking as fragile as a Dresden doll, Miss Cummins bites into her assignment like a shark. Mr. Dall’s pluck is just as admirable, even when he’s nervously begging his soulmate to make their next robbery ‘the lahst one’...we must say that it takes more than crime and the King Brothers to make sows’ ears out of silk purses.”

In his 1998 book &quot;Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir&quot;, critic and film historian Eddie Muller commends the production. &quot;Joseph H. Lewis&#x27;s direction&quot;, he notes, &quot;is propulsive, possessed of a confident, vigorous simplicity that all the frantic editing and visual pyrotechnics of the filmmaking progeny never quite surpassed.&quot;

Sam Adams, media critic for the &quot;Philadelphia City Paper&quot;, wrote in 2008: &quot;The codes of the time prevented Lewis from being explicit about the extent to which their fast-blooming romance is fueled by their mutual love of weaponry (Arthur Penn would rip off the covers in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, which owes &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; a substantial debt), but when Cummins&#x27; six-gun dangles provocatively as she gasses up their jalopy, it&#x27;s clear what really fills their collective tank.&quot;

The review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 91% of film critics gave the production a positive rating, one based on 64 reviews.

===Recognition===
In 1998, &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

<text>Desiree Carole Heslop (born 28 November 1961), best known as Princess, is a British singer who found chart success in the mid-1980s. In the early 1980s, she worked with the group Osibisa. She is best known for her hit single &quot;Say I&#x27;m Your Number One&quot; which made the UK Top Ten in 1985. 

==Career==
Princess initially started out in law as a secretary and sales assistant. During her first year of college she sang vocals on a punk rock track. Before going solo, she was a backing vocalist for the band Osibisa in the early 1980s. She recorded sessions on the Brilliant album &quot;Kiss The Lips of Life&quot;, which brought her to the attention of producers Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW).

Princess also sang backing vocals for artists such as Precious Wilson and Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King. In 1985, Princess, known as Desiree at the time, collaborated with 501&#x27;s, and released the single &quot;Let the Night Take the Blame&quot;, which was released under Fanfare Records. The single failed to chart.

Her debut solo album &quot;Princess&quot; (1986) was composed and produced by SAW which contained the hit single, &quot;Say I&#x27;m Your Number One&quot;. The album spawned five charting singles, and was certified Silver in the UK.

Princess signed with Polydor and recorded her second album, &quot;All for Love&quot; (1987) in the United States, but neither the album nor its three singles had much success.

Her third album, &quot;Say It&quot;, which was slated for release in 1990, was never issued as Princess retired from the music scene and moved to the US. She later returned to being a backing singer, appearing on the Vanilla Ice album &quot;To the Extreme&quot; that same year.

From 1991 to 2003 she lived in the US, then returned to England. She formed her own music label with her brother Donovan, OnDa Ground Music Label, which has released all her music since, and released her first single in 14 years, &quot;Ride&quot;, with rap ensemble EEDB. A music video was also filmed which referenced her retirement.

She appeared in ITV&#x27;s 2005 production &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot;, singing Kylie Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Slow&quot;.

In April 2014, she released her third album, &quot;The Emergence&quot;, the first in 27 years. It is the first in a trilogy of albums, the other ones titled &quot;The Passion&quot; and &quot;The One&quot;. 

In March 2019, she released the EP &quot;The Passion Part 1&quot;.

In May 2021, Princess released a teaser for her single &quot;Silhouettes in the Dark&quot;, which can be found on her YouTube channel. In July that year, an interview with Princess and her brother Donovan was featured on &quot;A Journey Through Soul&quot; podcast, which would later return in November.

On 14 February 2023 she released the single &quot;Will You Call Me&quot; from her upcoming album &quot;The Passion&quot;.

<doc id="73947" wikidata="Q851871" url="?curid=73947" title="Tourism in Bulgaria">
<text>Tourism in Bulgaria is a significant contributor to the country&#x27;s economy. Situated at the crossroads of the East and West, Bulgaria has been home to many civilizations: Thracians, Greeks, Romans, Eastern Romans or Byzantines, Slavs, Bulgars, and Ottomans. The country is rich in tourist sights and historical artifacts, scattered through a relatively small and easily accessible territory. Bulgaria is internationally known for its seaside and winter resorts.

Bulgaria attracted over 13 million foreign tourists in 2024, according to the latest data from the National Statistics Institute. Tourists from five countries (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Germany and United Kingdom) account for approximately 50% of all visitors. The sector contributed to 15% of GDP and supported 150,000 workplaces in 2014.

==Tourist attractions==
===UNESCO World Heritage Sites and Intangible Cultural Heritage List===
There are ten UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Bulgaria. The first four properties were inscribed in the World Heritage List in 1979, and the last in 2017. Bulgaria currently has sixteen additional properties on the Tentative List. Nestinarstvo, a ritual fire-dance of Thracian origin, is included in the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.

===Ethnic, cultural and historical tourism===

The Bulgarian cultural heritage has many faces and manifestations - archaeological reserves and monuments, museums, galleries, rich cultural calendar, preserved folklore and magnificent architectural monuments.

====Historical monuments and sites====
====Museums====
====Thracian treasures====
Thracians made beautifully ornate golden and silver objects such as various kinds of vessels, rhytons, facial masks, pectorals, jewelry, weapons, etc. They used to bury rich hoards of precious objects both to hide them in times of enemy invasions and unrest as well as for ritual purposes. To date, more than 80 Thracian treasures have been excavated in Bulgaria which was the cradle of the Thracian civilization. 
====Rural tourism====
The Bulgarian town house is an embodiment of the owner&#x27;s social status, craft and traditions. Many old buildings that demonstrate this type of architecture—e.g. in the villages of Arbanasi, Leshten, Kovachevitsa, Melnik—have been preserved to the present day.

==== Monasteries ====
During the 13th and especially during the 14th centuries the construction of monasteries thrived. Due to the troubled times many monasteries resembled fortresses. They usually had rectangular shape, the buildings surrounded a yard in which the main church was located. From the outside they had high stone walls reinforced with counterforts, and from the inside there were galleries with several stores which led towards the dwellings of the monks.

====Seaside resorts====

The Bulgarian Black Sea Coast is picturesque and diverse. White and golden sandy beaches occupy approximately 130 km of the 378 km long coast. The temperatures during the summer months are very suitable for marine tourism and the water temperature allows sea bathing from May to October. Prior to 1989 the Bulgarian Black Sea coast was internationally known as the Red Riviera. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, however, its nickname has been changed to the Bulgarian Riviera.
====Hiking and skiing====
The country has several ski areas which offer excellent conditions for skiing, snowboarding, ski running and other winter sports.
== National Parks ==
Bulgaria has 3 national parks, 11 nature parks and 55 nature reserves. The first nature park in Bulgaria and the Balkan Peninsula is Vitosha Nature Park, established in 1934.
===Caves and waterfalls===

As of 2002, there are around 4,500 discovered underground formations in Bulgaria. The earliest written records about the caves in Bulgaria are found in the manuscripts of the 17th century Bulgarian National Revival figure and historian Petar Bogdan. The first Bulgarian speleological society was established in 1929. The caves in the country are inhabited by more than 700 invertebrate species and 32 of the 37 species of bats found in Europe.

<doc id="73949" wikidata="Q41641" url="?curid=73949" title="Leo V the Armenian">
<text>Leo V the Armenian (, &quot;Leōn ho Armenios&quot;; 775 – 25 December 820) was the Byzantine emperor from 813 to 820. He is chiefly remembered for ending the decade-long war with the Bulgars, as well as initiating the second period of Byzantine iconoclasm.

A senior general of Armenian origin, Leo distinguished himself under Nikephoros I and Michael I Rhangabe, eventually becoming the &quot;stratēgos&quot; of the Anatolic Theme. Taking advantage of Michael&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Versinikia, he forced the emperor to abdicate in his favour. He was able to withhold the blockade of Constantinople by Krum of Bulgaria and, after Krum&#x27;s death, concluded a 30-year peace with his successor Omurtag.

In 815, Leo deposed Patriarch Nikephoros and reinstituted iconoclasm. He was assassinated by supporters of Michael the Amorian, one of his most trusted generals, who succeeded him on the throne in 820.

== Background ==
Leo was born in Umayyad Arminiya, the son of the patrician Bardas, who was of Armenian descent. According to Theophanes Continuatus, Leo was also of Assyrian/Syrian descent. In his youth he fled with his family to the Byzantine Empire and enrolled in the army of the Anatolic Theme. In 802, the general Bardanes Tourkos took over the theme and married one of his daughters to Leo. When Bardanes rebelled, Leo deserted to Emperor Nikephoros I who promoted him to the position of &quot;stratēgos&quot; of the Armeniac Theme. In 811, when Nikephoros was planning his major campaign against the Bulgars (which was to end disastrously), Arab raiders captured and destroyed the city of Euchaita in the Armeniac Theme—a humiliating defeat in which the salaries of the thematic units were also lost. Nikephoros blamed this on Leo and exiled him. Punishment also included deprivation of his military rank, beating and hair cutting. However, a modern scholar suggests this &quot;Leo&quot; mentioned in the contemporary sources as being punished by Nikephoros was not the same as the later Emperor Leo.

== Reign ==

Recalled by Michael I Rhangabe in 811, Leo became governor of the Anatolic Theme and conducted himself well in a war against the Arabs in 812, defeating the forces of the Cilician &quot;thughur&quot; under Thabit ibn Nasr. Leo survived the Battle of Versinikia in 813 by abandoning the battlefield, but nevertheless took advantage of this defeat to force the abdication of Michael I in his favor on 11 July 813. It was at this time that people assembled at the tomb of Constantine V, an emperor who was victorious against the Bulgars, and cried out to it: &quot;Arise and help the state which is perishing!&quot;

In a diplomatic move, Leo wrote a letter to Patriarch Nikephoros in order to reassure him of his orthodoxy (Nikephoros being obviously afraid of a possible iconoclast revival). A further step in preventing future usurpations was the castration of Michael I&#x27;s sons. One month later, during his entrance to the Palace quarter, he kneeled before the icon of Christ at the Chalke Gate, which was erected by Empress Irene.

Leo inherited a precarious situation. Within a week of his coronation, Khan Krum of Bulgaria blockaded both Adrianople and Constantinople by land. He agreed to negotiate in person with Krum but used the opportunity to attempt to have him assassinated. The stratagem failed, enraging Krum who sacked the suburbs of Constantinople and towns in southern Thrace. However, he abandoned his siege of the capital, and withdrew to capture and depopulate Adrianople. With this moment of respite, Leo divorced his allegedly adulterous wife and married the daughter of the &quot;patrikios&quot; Arsaber, the well-regarded Armenian noblewoman Theodosia, crowning her first son, the ten-year-old Symbatios, co-emperor, and renaming him Constantine, recalling the militarily successful iconoclast emperors of the eighth century, Leo III the Isaurian and Constantine V. In 814, Krum sacked Arcadiopolis and other Thracian towns, and planned a full-scale siege of Constantinople, but died of a stroke before he could begin, causing the Bulgar threat to finally recede.

=== The beginning of the second iconoclasm ===
The motives for the second iconoclasm appear to be more straightforward than in the first, and are much less contested among scholars. Like Emperor Philippikos&#x27; () re-introduction of monothelitism in 711, Leo&#x27;s adoption of iconoclasm was a strategy for imperial survival and a means of bolstering imperial authority (although it is noted that pragmatism and genuine conviction are not mutually exclusive, i.e., Leo may have had genuinely iconoclastic convictions). And just as Patriarch Nikephoros I and Theodore the Stoudite opposed imperial intervention in dogmatic matters, so too did Maximos the Confessor oppose the monothelite policies of Constans II (). In turn, Constans and Leo appealed to the legacy of Constantine the Great in convoking the First Council of Nicaea, and believed their actions were only a re-assertion of this legitimate imperial authority in spiritual matters.

Leo informed his advisers of his opinion that recent emperors had suffered defeat because of their veneration of icons (or &quot;iconodulia&quot;), unlike the iconoclast emperors Leo III and Constantine V who were victorious against the Arabs and Bulgars. He appointed a theological commission led by the monk John the Grammarian (later Patriarch of Constantinople John VII). When called to comment, the iconodule Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople rejected the report and argued that the biblical passages quoted as condemning iconodulia were not dealing with &quot;holy images&quot; but with idols. Leo asked the commission to produce a more carefully researched document, and enlisted the help of a major bishop, Antony, later Patriarch of Constantinople from 821. In the second document, the commission stated that, since the military blamed their defeats by the Bulgars on iconodulia, a compromise must be sought in which only images hanging low in churches (which are therefore able to be venerated) would be removed, but Nikephoros resisted again. Leo asked Nikephoros to provide biblical proof-texts for iconodulia but he appealed instead to the notion of the long-standing tradition of iconodulia. Leo then proposed a debate with the commission, but Nikephoros refused to participate. While Leo was attempting to present himself as a just arbitrator of a debate, rather than as a tyrant imposing iconoclasm for secular reasons (as was the characterisation of many iconodule accounts), debate among clergy only resulted in a stalemate. Some soldiers of the imperial guard threw stones and mud at the icon of Christ over the Chalke Gate, shouting iconoclastic slogans, prompting Leo to have it replaced with a cross.

This caused alarm among the clergy who met in the patriarchal palace on Christmas Eve 814. Patriarch Nikephoros refuted the document produced by the commission and had the clergy sign a pledge to oppose iconoclasm with their lives. The next day, Leo requested the iconodule clergy to engage in a debate with the commission, and kissed a small icon to demonstrate his desire for compromise. The influential iconodule abbot,Theodore the Stoudite, asked the Emperor not to involve himself in theological matters. After several weeks of correspondence and attempts by Leo to persuade clergy of the compromise proposal, Nikephoros remained unwavering in his views. At the beginning of Lent, he once again refused to discuss the issue and was deposed and exiled. Leo appointed the layman iconoclast Theodotos I, who held a synod to overturn the Second Council of Nicaea (787) and reaffirm the Council of Hieria (754) as the seventh ecumenical council. The &quot;Acts&quot; of the Council of Constantinople (815) differ from those of Hieria in that they do not charge the iconodules with idolatry, but rather &quot;folly&quot; and &quot;recklessness&quot;: &quot;we determine that the making of images is neither venerable nor useful, but we refrain from calling them idols, because even in evil exist different degrees&quot;. The central argument was that holy images were unsuitable if placed in areas that would implicitly or explicitly earn them the devotion and adoration which is due to God alone. Empress Irene was criticised for introducing the veneration of images, which are said to circumscribe the uncircumscribable and separate Christ&#x27;s humanity from his divinity. In this sense, images are also called &quot;falsely-named&quot; in that they do not truly represent what they are said to, since they do not share in the essence of the person depicted. Images are also not said to be endowed with divine grace.

Leo&#x27;s compromise policy resulted in great success, and Theodore of Stoudion reports in a letter that virtually the whole clergy of Constantinople adopted the imperial position, along with many bishops and laymen throughout the Empire. Those who refused to take communion with Patriarch Theodotos were forced into exile, and opponents of iconoclasm were often sentenced to flogging. However, Theodore also refers to &quot;orthodox&quot; churches which commemorated the name of the iconoclast Patriarch but still practiced the veneration of icons. The Emperor seized the properties of iconodules and monasteries, such as the rich Monastery of Stoudios, exiling Theodore the Stoudite. He also exiled other bishops that opposed him such as Anthony the Confessor and Theophanes the Confessor.

Leo likely realised that it was impossible to force everyone to agree with him, and so, similar to Constans II, was less concerned with convincing his opponents of iconoclasm than with convincing them to compromise and not pursue the matter further. In other words, he was more interested in ecclesiastical unity rather than strict iconoclasm. For example, in the &quot;Life&quot; of Nicetas of Medikion, it is reported that Patriarch Theodotos gave communion to iconodule monks while they were proclaiming &quot;Anathema to those who do not venerate the icon of Christ&quot;. Icons were not tolerated in prominent public spaces but were allowed in private, so long as people recognised the iconoclast Patriarch.
=== Later years ===
Shortly after the reinstitution of iconoclasm, the new Khan of Bulgaria, Omurtag, executed his Byzantine captives who refused to renounce Christianity, raided Thrace and ignored an imperial embassy, forcing Leo to fight. In the Battle of Mesembria of spring 816, Leo marched to the environs of Mesembria (Nesebar), camping near the Bulgars, pretending to flee and then ambushing them as they pursued him. He decisively defeated the Bulgar army and raided Bulgar territory, then concluding a 30-year peace treaty with Omurtag which restored the frontier of 780. According to some sources, Krum participated in the battle and abandoned the battlefield heavily injured.

While Leo was successful on the Bulgar front, relations with the Franks and the Papacy were difficult. Theodotos attempted to establish friendly relations with Pope Paschal I (817–824) but was rebuffed. Theodore the Stoudite pre-empted these efforts through his correspondence with Paschal beforehand, in which he criticised the iconoclast patriarch and directly appealed to the papacy to restore orthodoxy in the Byzantine Empire. 
Leo then worked to consolidate the Empire by rebuilding the Thracesian and Macedonian Themes. In 817, he sent fleets to raid the weakened Abbasid Caliphate and led an army to retake the frontier fortress of Kamachon which was lost under Constantine VI. In 818, the Rus&#x27; raided the Empire for the first time, specifically the northern coast of Anatolia, which Leo responded to by reinforcing the Armeniac Theme with naval squadrons. There was also mounting underground opposition to Leo&#x27;s reign and iconoclasm especially among monastic communities, one of the leaders of which was Theodore the Stoudite. In 820, Leo uncovered and punished a conspiracy against him. Nevertheless, it appeared to Leo, his iconoclast supporters and even some iconodules that the Empire was now in God&#x27;s favour with the reinstitution of iconoclasm, which had coincided with victory over the Bulgars as it had with Constantine V. Even sources vehemently hostile to Leo (e.g., Theophanes Continuatus and Patriarch Nikephoros) acknowledge his competence in managing state affairs. Although, as with all iconoclast emperors, his actions and intentions cannot be easily reconstructed due to the extreme bias of the iconodule sources (there are no surviving contemporary iconoclast sources of any kind). 

===Assassination===
The conspiracy which was to overthrow Leo was led by the Domestic of the Excubitors, Michael the Amorian, who disapproved of Leo&#x27;s divorce and remarriage (he was married to the sister of the divorcée). In late 820, agents of the Postal Logothete uncovered the plot. Leo imprisoned him and sentenced him to death by burning, but Empress consort Theodosia arranged a postponement of the execution until after Christmas. This allowed Michael to organise plotters to carry out the assassination of the Emperor in the palace chapel of St. Stephen on Christmas Eve. Leo was attending the &quot;matins&quot; service when a group of assassins disguised as members of the choir due to sing in the service suddenly threw off their robes and drew their weapons.

In the dim light they mistook the officiating priest for the Emperor and the confusion allowed Leo to snatch a heavy cross from the altar and defend himself. He called for his guards, but the conspirators had barred the doors and within a few moments a sword stroke had severed his arm, and he fell before the communion-table, where his body was hewed in pieces. His remains were dumped unceremoniously in the snow and the assassins hurried to the dungeons to free Michael. 

Unfortunately for them Leo had hidden the key on his person, and since it was too early in the morning to find a blacksmith, Michael was hastily crowned as emperor with the iron clasps still around his legs. Leo&#x27;s family (including his mother and his wife, Theodosia) was exiled to monasteries on the Princes&#x27; Islands. His four sons (including ex co-emperor Symbatios) were castrated, a procedure so brutally carried out that one of them died during the &quot;operation&quot;.

==Assessment and legacy==
While the Byzantine bureaucracy preferred the new emperor Michael II () to Leo, who reinitiated the iconoclast controversy, Leo was popular with the army due to his military victories. Upon news of his assassination, the Anatolic Theme proclaimed Thomas the Slav, who had served with Leo and Michael under Bardanes Tourkos, rightful emperor and avenger of Leo. The Bucellarian, Paphlagonian and Cibyrrhaeot Themes immediately sided with the Anatolics, leading to the outbreak of civil war in 821. Despite overthrowing Leo, Michael continued his iconoclast policies.

The second Byzantine iconoclasm was more moderate than the first. Images that were not actively venerated were permitted and iconodules were not accused of idolatry. There is no substantial evidence that Leo was a fierce persecutor of iconodules as some accounts claim. And further, it is most likely that the second iconoclasm was a genuine reflection of anxiety in the military and the Constantinopolitan population. The military especially was clearly inspired by the heroic image of the iconoclast Constantine V. Leo found more allies in the clergy, especially the learned figure of John VII of Constantinople, his appointee. By the reign of Theophilos (), Theodore the Stoudite and most iconodule bishops had died. However, iconoclasm never had a strong base in the Church, and was easily abolished after Theophilos&#x27; death by Empress regent Theodora. John VII was replaced by the iconodule Methodios I. After the institution of the liturgical Feast of Orthodoxy on 11 March 843, now a symbol of the Eastern Orthodox faith, iconoclasm was very rarely defended by any Byzantine clergy. The efforts of the church to affirm its autonomy against imperial authority permanently excluded the Byzantine emperors from ruling on matters of dogma and established the Patriarch of Constantinople as the uncontested head of the church.

Leo resembled the emperors of Isaurian dynasty in ways besides his iconoclasm. By later chroniclers, he was given the reputation of being populist and eager to both pursue justice and undo injustices carried out by the Byzantine bureacracy. He was a particularly active military leader, going on campaign almost every year.
=== Possible descendants ===
Nicholas Adontz, in his book &quot;The age and origins of the emperor Basil I&quot; (1933), expressed a theory that Leo V and Theodosia were ancestors of Basil I. The theory was partly based on the account of his ancestry given by Constantine VII, a grandson of Basil I, as well as the accounts given by Theophanes Continuatus. Basil I, according to these accounts, was a son of peasants. His mother is named by Constantine VII as &quot;Pankalo&quot;. The name of his father was not recorded, but the names Symbatios (Smbat) and Constantine have been suggested; both were names used by the eldest sons of Basil, with eldest sons of Byzantines typically named after their grandfathers. The paternal grandfather of Basil is named as Maiactes (or Hmayeak in Armenian). Basil&#x27;s paternal grandmother was not named but was identified as a daughter of &quot;Leo&quot;, a citizen of Constantinople. Adontz identified this Leo as Leo V, which would make Leo V and Theodosia great-grandparents of Basil I. 

The scholar Chris Bennett has hypothesised that, for this theory to be true, Leo&#x27;s daughter would had to have been of marriageable age between the years 780 to 797, which given the ages of her brothers (all born after 800) is unlikely. However, as a counter-argument Bennett has also suggested that Constantine VII may have made a mistake when determining the years separating Maiactes and Basil, and that the latter may have been born at least 20 years after his reported birth date of 811. This would indicate that it was Basil&#x27;s father, rather than Basil himself, who was born at this time and had witnessed the wars with Krum of Bulgaria, and that Leo&#x27;s daughter could therefore have been born (rather than married) in the 790s, which would make Adontz&#x27; theory possible.

Adontz&#x27; theory has been accepted by several genealogists, including Christian Settipani in his search for descent from antiquity. The name &quot;Anna&quot; has been suggested for the daughter of Leo V and Theodosia, because it was given to daughters of Basil I, Leo VI the Wise, Constantine VII and Romanos II – almost every emperor that would claim descent from this woman.
==Family==
All known children of Leo V are traditionally attributed to his wife Theodosia, a daughter of the patrician Arsaber. Genesius records four sons:
* Symbatios (Συμβάτιος), renamed Constantine, co-emperor from 814 to 820. Castrated and exiled following the assassination of his father.
* Basil. Castrated and exiled following the assassination of his father. Still alive in 847, recorded to have supported the election of Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople.
* Gregory. Castrated and exiled following the assassination of his father. Still alive in 847, recorded to have supported the election of Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople.
* Theodosios (died in 820). Died soon after his castration.

The existence of a daughter has been debated by historians and genealogists. The tentative name &quot;Anna&quot; has been suggested (see above).

<text>are a fictional turtle-like race of characters from the &quot;Mario&quot; media franchise. They are commonly referred to as Koopas, a more broad classification of creatures that includes Bowser, his Koopalings, and Lakitu. Predecessors to Koopa Troopas, first appeared in the 1983 game &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, while Koopa Troopas themselves debuted two years later in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985). Koopa Troopas are a common staple in most &quot;Super Mario&quot; and spin-off games. When defeated, they may flee from or retreat inside their shells, which can usually be used as weapons. Koopa shells are a recurring weapon in the franchise, particularly popularized in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, in which they can be fired as projectiles against other racers. Despite making up the bulk of Bowser&#x27;s army, Koopa Troopas are often shown to be peaceful, sometimes even teaming up with protagonist Mario.

== Concept and creation ==
After the release and success of the arcade game &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981), Nintendo began work on a follow-up game more prominently focusing on the character of Mario, which released as &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; (1983). The idea of creating a turtle enemy came as a result of developing its core gameplay mechanics. After designers Gunpei Yokoi and Shigeru Miyamoto established that the game would revolve around Mario possessing superhuman jumping abilities that were to be used to jump between different floors of platforms, they approached how enemies would be attacked. They came up with the idea of the player attacking enemies from one level below, making Mario hit his ceiling so that it would bump the enemy&#x27;s floor and defeat them. However, this method of defeating enemies was deemed too easy in playtesting, so they instead implemented a two-step approach of having to stun the enemies first. When thinking about what types of enemies it would make sense to stun like this, they came up with the idea of a turtle getting stuck after getting knocked upside down on its shell. So the gameplay was set up so that the player would now hit the turtle from below, knocking it on its back, and then jump directly on it to defeat it before it was able to correct itself.

With the premise established, they turned to creating the turtle character itself. Miyamoto initially dictated what he wanted it to look like to a Nintendo designer, but the initial draft came out looking like a very realistic looking turtle that Miyamoto felt did not fit in well with the rest of the &quot;Mario&quot; art style. Instead, Miyamoto drew the concept art himself, emphasizing a cartoonish large head and more of a tortoise-like shape. With discussing the anatomy of turtles with fellow Nintendo staffer Hirokazu Tanaka, they came up with the idea of the turtle character getting knocked out of its shell entirely. While conceding that this is not how turtle shells work, Miyamoto liked the idea because it helped with visualizing when the turtle was still in a stunned state; out of its shell, it was stunned, and once it returned, it was active again. While initially wondered if this was a form of &quot;lying to children&quot;, in the end, he decided that the ability to entirely remove the body from the shell would be a key difference between a turtle and a Koopa Troopa.

For the &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; game the character would be named &quot;Shellcreepers&quot;, but in subsequent &quot;Super Mario&quot; games, the character would be renamed Koopa Troopa. Up until very late pre-release builds of its follow up game, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985), Koopa Troopa was the only enemy in the game; however, playtesting found that his 2-step process of defeating him was too difficult for early stages of the game. Rather than change Koopa Troopa, this led to the creation of another long-running &quot;Mario&quot; character – the Goomba. Similarly, when developer Takashi Tezuka wished to create a new enemy character that could fly, he found himself unable to due to size and memory restrictions of the Nintendo Entertainment System hardware. Instead, to save on memory he decided to build off of the established Koopa Troopa design by adding wings to the top of his shell. While Miyamoto expressed hesitation at first, he was convinced when he saw the final design, and thus, the Koopa Paratroopa was born and implemented into the game. As Nintendo progressed with developing games for more powerful hardware, this allowed for further developments on the evolution of Koopa Troopas. &quot;Super Mario World&quot; (1991), the first &quot;Super Mario&quot; game for the more powerful Super Nintendo platform, allowed for more advanced movement and animations, including unshelled Koopa Troopas who flew around in capes and slid down hills. This later influenced the development of &quot;Super Mario Bros. Wonder&quot; (2023) as well; when developers were looking for ways to update old character designs with new animations and designs, the Rolla Koopa – a Koopa Troopa who moves around on roller skates, was created. More powerful hardware also lead to a more vibrant yellow and green color scheme for the character.

==Appearances==
===Video games===
Since their creation and first appearances in &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, Koopa Troopa have become a staple in the &quot;Mario&quot; series and subseries. Koopa Troopa has reappeared in most entries of the &quot;Super Mario&quot; line of platform games. They commonly retain their original traits of wandering aimlessly through levels, and requiring to be knocked out of their shell prior to their defeat. After defeat, their shells often remain, and can be grabbed, thrown, or bumped as a projectile to attack other enemies or alter the game environment.

They are also featured prominently in many spinoff series as well. They have been included as a playable character in most entries in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; racing series. Koopa Shells are used as an obtainable projectile weapon to shoot at other players in every entry as well. Similarly, Koopa Shells are used in the same manner in entries of the &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; and &quot;Mario Strikers&quot; (soccer) series as well, with playable character options sporadically occurring across entries. They are playable in some &quot;Mario Golf&quot; entries as well. While not present as playable characters in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, their shells have appeared as projectile weapons to be launched at other characters in every entry of the series. Koopa Troopas appear as hosts or extra minor characters across all entries of the &quot;Mario Party&quot; board game/minigame series, and is a playable character in &quot;Mario Party 9&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Party&quot;.

===In other media===
Koopa Troopas commonly appear in other &quot;Mario&quot; media as well. They were featured prominently in the 2023 &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; as part of Bowser&#x27;s army. The film introduced the Spiny shell Koopa Troopa; &quot;Mario Kart&quot; has prominently feature the infamous blue shell item, but the film was first to see the shell used on actual characters. They largely retain their roles from the game as minions in Bowser&#x27;s army, and general appearance from the modern games, albeit with wearing armor and spiked shells. Toys of a Koopa Troopa riding a bike were released in promotion of the 2023 film as well. In addition to toys, they were also featured in multiple toys-to-life iterations, including getting his own Amiibo in 2017. They appear in the Wii U version of &quot;&quot;, being summoned by Bowser during one of his special moves. Their signature shell was included as a player piece in the Nintendo version of the &quot;Monopoly&quot; board game.

==Reception and legacy==
Koopa Troopa has gone on to become one of the most commonly recognizable enemies in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise alongside Goomba. &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Audrey Drake listed Koopa Troopa as one of the best &quot;Mario&quot; enemies, saying that it is one of the most &quot;iconic &quot;Mario&quot; enemies out there. In fact, they&#x27;re pretty much synonymous with the franchise.&quot; In October 2022, &quot;The Daily Dot&quot; reported that a Koopa Troopa video clip from a &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot; game went viral on TikTok. In the video, two Koopa Troopas running in unison slowly make progress in crossing a spinning circular platform. However, in this game, Koopa Troopas always stop and briefly dance whenever a &quot;bah bah&quot; sound clip plays in the game&#x27;s background music. In the clip, they stop and dance, and it cancels all of their progress on traversing the spinning platform, keeping them stuck in a loop. The video elicited much commentary on Koopa Troopas being forced to dance at inopportune times. The Koopa Troopa clip amassed 20 million views in under a month, and inspired over 20,000 similar videos related to Koopa Troopas dancing to the sound clip.

The design of Koopa Troopa would influence and impact the creation of other &quot;Mario&quot; characters as well. In creating a second playable character for &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, the developers decided to make a palette swapped version of Mario, and due to hardware limitations regarding how many different colors could be appearing on screen, they decided to use the green color used for Koopa Troopa, eventually leading to the creation of Luigi and his trademark green color scheme. Koopa Troopa&#x27;s design also influenced Bowser&#x27;s final design. Miyamoto&#x27;s initial instructions to character designer Yoichi Kotabe resulted in more of an ox-like character design, and their efforts to revise his art to make him look more like Koopa Troopas resulted in Bowser&#x27;s final design.

Koopa Troopa has later been used by Nintendo in larger scale promotions outside of video games as well. In 2015, the character was part of Nintendo&#x27;s float at the Toronto Santa Claus Parade. They&#x27;ve also become an integral part of the Super Nintendo World theme park area in Universal parks. Koopa Troopa animatronics are found wandering throughout the park, while restaurants serve up Koopa Troopa calzones. A Koopa Troopa also serves as one of the bosses of the their real world adventure games, while a Koopa Troopa and its shell are central one of the parks central games, &quot;Koopa Troopa POWer Punch&quot;. In it, players in real life attempt to hit POW Blocks to knock over Koopa Troopas, similar to early &quot;Mario&quot; games.

<text>&quot;Gunga Din&quot; () is an 1890 poem by Rudyard Kipling set in British India.
The poem was published alongside &quot;Mandalay&quot; and &quot;Danny Deever&quot; in the collection &quot;Barrack-Room Ballads&quot;. 

The poem is much remembered for its final line &quot;You&#x27;re a better man than I am, Gunga Din&quot;.

==Background==
The poem is a rhyming narrative from the point of view of a British soldier in India. Its eponymous character is an Indian water-carrier (a &quot;bhishti&quot;) who, after the narrator is wounded in battle, saves his life, only to be shot and killed. In the final three lines, the soldier regrets the abuse that he dealt to Din and admits that Din is the better man. The poem was published as part of a set of martial poems called the &quot;Barrack-Room Ballads&quot;.

In contrast to Kipling&#x27;s later poem &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;, &quot;Gunga Din&quot; is named after the Indian and portrays him as a heroic character who is not afraid to face danger on the battlefield as he tends to wounded men. The white soldiers who order Din around and beat him for not bringing water to them fast enough are presented as being callous and shallow and ultimately inferior to him.

Although &quot;Din&quot; is frequently pronounced to rhyme with &quot;pin&quot;, the rhymes within the poem make it clear that it should be pronounced , to rhyme with &quot;green&quot;.

T. S. Eliot included the poem in his 1941 collection &quot;A Choice of Kipling&#x27;s Verse&quot;.

==Adaptations and references in popular culture==
The poem inspired the 1939 adventure film &quot;Gunga Din&quot; from RKO Pictures, starring Sam Jaffe in the title role, along with Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and Joan Fontaine. This movie was remade in 1961 as &quot;Sergeants 3&quot;, starring the Rat Pack with Sammy Davis Jr. as the Gunga Din character, in which the locale was moved from British-colonial India to the old West. Many elements of the 1939 film were also incorporated into &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;. The film &quot;Three Kings&quot;, set during the Gulf War of 1990–1991, also has many resemblances, including a &quot;heist theme&quot;, to the film &quot;Gunga Din&quot;.

Grantland Rice&#x27;s 1917 column describing Heinie Zimmerman&#x27;s infamous World Series gaffe wherein Zimmerman futilely chased speedster Eddie Collins across home plate (rather than initiating a rundown by tossing the ball to a player covering home) ended with &quot;I&#x27;m a faster man than you are, Heinie Zim.&quot;

Robert Sheckley&#x27;s short story &quot;Human Man&#x27;s Burden&quot; (1956, anthologized in &quot;Pilgrimage to Earth&quot;) alludes to the story by featuring a robotic servant named Gunga Sam, programmed to behave in a manner similar to the stereotypical colonial native servant. While stated to have no soul, he ultimately proves to be no less human and wise than his owner in actions.

In 1958, Bobby Darin wrote and recorded the song &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Love Is&quot; in which, referring to the unsolved riddle of love, he sings &quot;And if ya come up with the answer, You&#x27;re a better man, sir, than I ... Gunga Din&quot;.

In 1964 Duane Hiatt and the group The 3Ds released an album of classic poetry set to music, including Gunga Din, with lyrics almost word for word from Kipling&#x27;s poem.

Songwriter Jim Croce set the words to music as &quot;The Ballad of Gunga Din&quot; and released it on his 1966 &quot;Facets&quot; album.

In &quot;Carry On Up the Khyber&quot; (1968), part of the &quot;Carry On&quot; series of British comedy films, the rebel warrior chief is called Bungdit Din (Bernard Bresslaw), a parody of Gunga Din. In a scene where he boasts of wiping out the Khyber Pass garrison, the &quot;Khazi of Kalabar&quot; (Kenneth Williams) replies: &quot;You&#x27;re a better man than me, Bungdit Din.&quot;

In 1996, the animated television series &quot;Animaniacs&quot; featured a segment called &quot;Gunga Dot&quot;, in which the &quot;Warner Sister&quot; Dot has a job serving water to the patrons of a resort in a boiling hot desert near Bombay. After growing tired of the constant complaining, she releases the valve on the Warner Bros. Water Tower, which placates the guests and somehow creates the Indian Ocean.

In 2015, The Libertines, an English rock band, composed the single &quot;Gunga Din&quot; for their comeback album &quot;Anthems for Doomed Youth&quot;. The verse &quot;You are a better man than I am&quot; is used throughout the lyrics.

<text>Leo IV the Khazar (Greek: Λέων ὁ Χάζαρος, &quot;Leōn ho Khazaros&quot;; 25 January 750 – 8 September 780) was Byzantine emperor from 775 to 780 AD. He was born to Emperor Constantine V and Empress Tzitzak in 750. He was elevated to co-emperor in the next year, in 751, and married to Irene of Athens in 769. When Constantine V died in September 775, while campaigning against the Bulgars, Leo IV became senior emperor. In 778 Leo raided Abbasid Syria, decisively defeating the Abbasid army outside of Germanikeia. Leo died on 8 September 780, of tuberculosis. He was succeeded by his underage son Constantine VI, with Irene serving as regent.

==Biography==
Leo IV was born on 25 January 750AD, to Emperor Constantine V and his first wife, Empress Tzitzak who had been given the Christian name Eirene. Because his mother was a Khazar, Leo was given the epithet &#x27;the Khazar&#x27;. Leo was elevated to co-emperor in 751, while still an infant. He became emperor on 14 September 775, after Constantine V died while campaigning against the Bulgarian Empire.

Leo was by this point suffering from tuberculosis, which, combined with the infancy of his son, Constantine VI, gave two of Leo&#x27;s half-brothers, the &quot;caesares&quot; Nikephoros and Christopher, hope of attaining the throne. These hopes were crushed when, in 776, Leo elevated Constantine to &quot;caesar&quot;, declaring him to be his successor. Shortly after this, Nikephoros and Christopher were discovered conspiring against Leo. Despite public opinion supporting the execution of the pair, Leo instead chose to pardon them, although he did exile several other plotters to Cherson.

In 776–777, Khan Telerig of Bulgaria sought refuge in Constantinople, was baptized in the presence of Leo and married a relation of the empress consort Irene of Athens. This demonstrates close relations between the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgars during Leo&#x27;s reign, which were facilitated by his father Constantine V&#x27;s successful campaigns against them between 760 and 775, establishing a state of peace.

Leo continued with his father&#x27;s resettlement policies, relocating prisoners from cities on the Arab border (Germanikeia, Melitene and Theodosioupolis) to newly-constructed military encampments or fortresses (&quot;castra&quot;) in Thrace.

===Campaigns against the Abbasid Caliphate===
Caliph al-Mahdi () of the Abbasids launched an invasion of the Byzantine Empire in 776 with himself present. The Byzantines retaliated in 778, invading Syria with a force made up of the armies of the multiple themes, including: the Opsikion Theme, led by Gregory; the Anatolic Theme, led by Artabasdos; the Armeniac Theme, led by Karisterotzes; the Bucellarian Theme, led by Tatzates; and the Thracesian Theme, led by the favourite commander of the Isaurian dynasty, Michael Lachanodrakon. Lachanodrakon besieged Germanikeia for a time, then lifted the siege (according to Theophanes the Confessor, he was bribed to do so) and began to raid the surrounding countryside, deporting many Jacobite Christians to Thrace. The Abbasids attacked Lachanodrakon while he was raiding, but were decisively defeated by several Byzantine armies. The Byzantine generals who led troops during this battle were given a triumphal entry when they returned to Constantinople. In 779, Leo successfully repelled an attack by the Abbasids against Asia Minor.

=== Death and succession ===
Leo died of a violent fever, due to his tuberculosis, on 8 September 780. Constantine, still only nine years old, became the new emperor, with Irene as his regent.

<text>Adobe FrameMaker is a document processor designed for writing and editing large or complex documents, including structured documents. It was originally developed by Frame Technology Corporation, which was bought by Adobe.

== Overview ==
FrameMaker became an Adobe product in October 1995 when Adobe purchased Frame Technology Corp. Adobe added SGML support, which was eventually adapted into XML support. In April 2004, Adobe stopped supporting FrameMaker for the Macintosh.

This reinvigorated rumors surfacing in 2001 that product development and support for FrameMaker were being wound down. Adobe denied these rumors in 2001, later releasing FrameMaker 8 at the end of July 2007, FrameMaker 9 in 2009, FrameMaker 10 in 2011, FrameMaker 11 in 2012, FrameMaker 12 in 2014, FrameMaker (2015 release - confusingly, internal version 13.0) in June 2015, FrameMaker 2017 (internal version 14.0) in January 2017, FrameMaker 2019 (internal version 15.0) in August 2018, FrameMaker 2020 (internal version 16.0) in 2020, and FrameMaker 2022 (internal version 17.0) in 2022.

FrameMaker has two ways of approaching documents: structured and unstructured.

* Structured FrameMaker is used to achieve consistency in documentation within industries such as aerospace, where several models of the same complex product exist, or pharmaceuticals, where translation and standardization are important requirements in communications about products. Structured FrameMaker uses SGML and XML concepts. The author works with an EDD (Element Definition Document), which is a FrameMaker-specific DTD (Document Type Definition). The EDD defines the structure of a document where meaningful units are designated as &quot;elements&quot; nested in each other depending on their relationships, and where the formatting of these elements is based on their contexts. Attributes or Metadata can be added to these elements and used for single source publishing or for filtering elements during the output processes (such as publishing for print or for Web-based display). The author can view the conditions and contexts in a tree-like structure derived from the grammar (as specified by the DTD) or as formatted in a typical final output form.
* Unstructured FrameMaker uses tagged paragraphs without any imposed logical structure, except that expressed by the author’s concept, topic organization, and the formatting supplied by paragraph and character tags.

When a user opens a structured file in unstructured FrameMaker, the structure is lost.

== MIF ==
MIF (Maker Interchange Format) is a markup language that functions as a companion to FrameMaker. MIF always had 3 purposes. The first was to represent FrameMaker documents in a relatively simple ASCII-based format, which can be produced or understood by other software systems and also by human operators. The second was to ensure any version of FrameMaker could read a document produced by any other version, at least to the extent it had the same features. While every version of FrameMaker could read the last couple of version&#x27;s documents, reading them all took too much software effort and testing, so reading MIF was sufficient. The third was to ensure that FrameMaker would never lose a writer&#x27;s work. If FrameMaker crashed, it would first write out the current document in MIF.

Any document that can be created interactively in FrameMaker can also be represented, exactly and completely, in MIF (the reverse, however, is not true: a few FrameMaker features are available only through MIF). All versions of FrameMaker can export documents in MIF, and can also read MIF documents, including documents created by an earlier version or by another program.

== History ==
Frame Technology was founded in 1986 by David Murray, Charles Corfield, Steven Kirsch, and Vickie Blackslee.
While working on his doctorate in astrophysics at Columbia University, Corfield, a mathematician alumnus of the University of Cambridge, decided to write a WYSIWYG document editor on a Sun-2 workstation. 

The only substantial DTP product at the time of FrameMaker&#x27;s conception was Interleaf, which also ran on Sun workstations.

After only a few months, Corfield had completed a functional prototype he called /etc/publisher. The prototype caught the eye of salesmen at the fledgling Sun Microsystems, which lacked commercial applications to showcase the graphics capabilities of their workstations. They got permission from Corfield to use the prototype of /etc/publisher as demoware for their computers.

Kirsch and Blakeslee were founding members of Mouse Systems, where they brought on Murray as Director of Application Software Development. In early 1986, Kirsch and Murray were visiting Sun Microsystems where they were given a demonstration of /etc/publisher. They thought there was a great opportunity for this and contacted Corfield. After several days of meetings they decided to form a company together. Kirsch, Murray, and Blakeslee left Mouse Systems and Corfield moved from New York to join them.

Originally written for SunOS (a variant of UNIX) on Sun machines, FrameMaker was a popular technical writing tool, and the company was profitable early on. Because of the flourishing desktop publishing market on the Apple Macintosh, the software was ported to the Mac as its second platform.

In the early 1990s, a wave of UNIX workstation vendors—Apollo, Data General, MIPS, Motorola and Sony—provided funding to Frame Technology for an OEM version for their platforms.

At the height of its success, FrameMaker ran on more than thirteen UNIX platforms, including NeXT Computer&#x27;s NeXTSTEP, Dell&#x27;s System V Release 4 UNIX and IBM&#x27;s AIX operating systems.

Sun Microsystems and AT&amp;T were promoting the OPEN LOOK GUI standard to win over Motif, so Sun contracted Frame Technology to implement a version of FrameMaker on their PostScript-based NeWS windowing system. The NeWS version of FrameMaker was successfully released to those customers adopting the OPEN LOOK standards.

At this point, FrameMaker was considered an extraordinary product for its day, not only enabling authors to produce highly structured documents with relative ease, but also giving users a great deal of typographical control in a reasonably intuitive and totally WYSIWYG way. The output documents could be of very high typographical quality.

Frame Technology later ported FrameMaker to Microsoft Windows, but the company lost direction soon after its release. Up to this point, FrameMaker had been targeting a professional market for highly technical publications, such as the maintenance manuals for the Boeing 777 project, and licensed each copy for $2,500. But the Windows version brought the product to the $500 price range, which cannibalized its own non-Windows customer base.

The company&#x27;s attempt to sell sophisticated technical publishing software to the home DTP market was a disaster. A tool designed for a 1,000-page manual was too cumbersome and difficult for an average home user to type a one-page letter.

Adobe Systems acquired the product and returned the focus to the professional market. Then, they released a new version under the name Adobe FrameMaker 5.1 in 1996. Today, Adobe FrameMaker is still a widely used publication tool for technical writers, although no version has been released for the Mac OS X operating system, limiting use of the product. The decision to cancel FrameMaker for OS X caused considerable friction between Adobe and Mac users, including Apple itself, which relied on it for creating documentation. As late as 2008, Apple manuals for OS X Leopard and the iPhone were still being developed on FrameMaker 7 in Classic mode; Apple has since switched to using InDesign.

FrameMaker versions 5.x through 7.2 (from mid-1995 to 2005) did not contain updates to major parts of the program (including its general user interface, table editing, and illustration editing), concentrating instead on bug fixes and the integration of XML-oriented features (previously part of the FrameMaker+SGML premium product). FrameMaker did not feature multiple undo until version 7.2 (its 2005 release).

FrameMaker 8 (2007) introduced Unicode, Flash, 3D, and built-in DITA support. Platform support included Windows (2000, XP, and Vista) and Sun Solaris (8, 9, and 10).

FrameMaker 9 (2009) introduced a redesigned user interface and several enhancements, including: full support for DITA, support for more media types, better PDF output, and enhanced WebDAV-based CMS integration. Platform support for Sun Solaris and Windows 2000 was dropped, leaving Windows XP and Windows Vista as the sole remaining platforms.

FrameMaker 10 (2011) again refined the user interface and introduced several changes, including: integration with content management systems via EMC Documentum 6.5 with Service Pack 1 and Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007 with Service Pack 2.

== Other FrameMaker tools ==

* FrameMaker Publishing Server is an online document processor server for automated creation of multi-use content types. The web interface enables users to direct aggregation of differing information sources routinely into detailed a presentation in multiple environments on numerous devices.

== Alternatives and competition ==
There were several major competitors in the technical publishing market, such as Arbortext, Interleaf, and Corel Ventura. Many academic users now use LaTeX, because modern editors have made that system increasingly user-friendly, and LyX allows LaTeX to be generated with little or no knowledge of LaTeX. Several formats, including DocBook XML, target authors of technical documents about computer hardware and software. Lastly, alternatives to FrameMaker for technical writing include Help authoring tools and XML editors.

<doc id="73962" wikidata="Q320168" url="?curid=73962" title="Abgar V">
<text>Abgar V (c. 1st century BC – c. AD 50), called Ukkāmā (meaning &quot;the Black&quot; in Syriac and other dialects of Aramaic), was the King of Osroene with his capital at Edessa.

== Background ==

Abgar was described as &quot;king of the Arabs&quot; by the Roman historian Tacitus, a near-contemporary source. The 5th-century Armenian historian Moses of Chorene depicted Abgar as an Armenian, but modern scholarly consensus agree that the Abgarids were in fact an Arab dynasty.

Moses of Chorene notes that Abgar V&#x27;s chief wife was Queen Helena of Adiabene, but according to the contemporary Jewish historian Josephus she was the wife of King Monobaz I of Adiabene.

== Letter of Abgar to Jesus ==
Abgar V is said to be one of the first Christian kings, having been converted to the faith by Thaddeus of Edessa, one of the seventy disciples.

The church historian Eusebius recorded that the Edessan archives contained a copy of a correspondence exchanged between Abgar of Edessa and Jesus. The correspondence consisted of Abgar&#x27;s letter and the answer dictated by Jesus. On 15 August 944, the Church of St. Mary of Blachernae in Constantinople received the letter and the Mandylion. Both relics were then moved to the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos.

This account enjoyed great popularity in the East and in the West during the Middle Ages. Jesus&#x27; letter was copied on parchment, inscribed in marble and metal, and used as a talisman or an amulet. Of this correspondence, there survives not only a Syriac text, but an Armenian translation as well, two independent Greek versions, shorter than the Syriac, and several inscriptions on stone.

Scholars have disputed many aspects of this account such as whether Abgar suffered from gout or from leprosy, or whether the correspondence was on parchment or papyrus.

The text of the letter was:
Jesus gave the messenger the reply to return to Abgar:
Egeria wrote of the letter in her account of her pilgrimage in Edessa. She read the letter during her stay around 384, and remarked that the copy in Edessa was &quot;fuller&quot; than the copies in her home (which was likely France).

In addition to the importance it attained in the apocryphal cycle, the correspondence of King Abgar also gained a place in liturgy for some time. The Syriac liturgies commemorate the correspondence of Abgar during Lent. The Celtic liturgy appears to have attached importance to it; the &quot;Liber Hymnorum&quot;, a manuscript preserved at Trinity College, Dublin (E. 4, 2), gives two collects on the lines of the letter to Abgar. It is even possible that this letter, followed by various prayers, may have formed a minor liturgical office in some Catholic churches.

This event has played an important part in the self-definition of several Eastern churches. Abgar is counted as saint, with feasts on 11 May and 28 October in the Eastern Orthodox Church, Thursday of the Third Week of Lent (Mid-Lent) in the Syriac Orthodox Church, and daily in the Mass of the Armenian Apostolic Church. 

=== Critical scholarship ===
A number of contemporary scholars have suggested origins of the tradition of Abgar&#x27;s conversion apart from historical record. Walter Bauer argued the legend was written without sources to reinforce group cohesiveness, orthodoxy, and apostolic succession against heretical schismatics. However, several distinct sources, known to have not been in contact with one another, claimed to have seen the letters in the archives, so his claim is suspect.

Significant advances in scholarship on the topic have been made including Desreumaux&#x27;s translation with commentary, M. Illert&#x27;s collection of textual witnesses to the legend, and detailed studies of the ideology of the sources by Brock, Griffith and Mirkovic. The majority of scholars now claim the goal of the authors and editors of texts regarding the conversion of Abgar were not so much concerned with historical reconstruction of the Christianisation of Edessa as the relationships between church and state power, based on the political and ecclesiological ideas of Ephraem the Syrian. However, the origins of the story are still far from certain, although the stories as recorded seem to have been shaped by the controversies of the third century CE, especially as a response to Bardaisan.

==Letters of Abgar to Tiberius==

Letters between Abgar V and the Roman Emperor Tiberius are also recorded in history, by for instance the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi, scholars as Ilaria Ramelli have argued for the core of these being essentially authentic based on:
 This work seems to preserve very ancient material, such as the information on the friendship between Abgar, correctly called toparkhês of Edessa, and the prefect of Egypt, in my view probably A. Avillius Flaccus, who ruled Egypt AD 32 to 38—just the years of Vitellius’ mandate in the Near East and of the Abgar-Tiberius correspondence—and is well known to us thanks to Philo, &quot;In Flaccum&quot;, 1-3; 25; 40; 116; 158. He was one of the most intimate friends of Tiberius; he was born and grew up in Rome with Augustus’ nieces, obtained the government of Egypt, a direct possession of the emperor, and probably helped the good relationship between Abgar and Tiberius that is evident in their correspondence.

Abgar&#x27;s initial letter to Tiberius read:

Abgar, king of Armenia, to my Lord Tiberius, emperor of the Romans, greeting:—

I know that nothing is unknown to your Majesty, but, as your friend, I would make you better acquainted with the facts by writing. The Jews who dwell in the cantons of Palestine have crucified Jesus: Jesus without sin, Jesus after so many acts of kindness, so many wonders and miracles wrought for their good, even to the raising of the dead. Be assured that these are not the effects of the power of a simple mortal, but of God. During the time that they were crucifying Him, the sun was darkened, the earth was moved, shaken; Jesus Himself, three days afterwards, rose from the dead and appeared to many. Now, everywhere, His name alone, invoked by His disciples, produces the greatest miracles: what has happened to myself is the most evident proof of it. Your august Majesty knows henceforth what ought to be done in future with respect to the Jewish nation, which has committed this crime; your Majesty knows whether a command should not be published through the whole universe to worship Christ as the true God. Safety and health.

Tiberius&#x27; reply read:

Tiberius, emperor of the Romans, to Abgar, king of the Armenians, greeting:—

Your kind letter has been read to me, and I wish that thanks should be given to you from me. Though we had already heard several persons relate these facts, Pilate has officially informed us of the miracles of Jesus. He has certified to us that after His resurrection from the dead He was acknowledged by many to be God. Therefore I myself also wished to do what you propose; but, as it is the custom of the Romans not to admit a god merely by the command of the sovereign, but only when the admission has been discussed and examined in full senate, I proposed the affair to the senate, and they rejected it with contempt, doubtless because it had not been considered by them first. But we have commanded all those whom Jesus suits, to receive him among the gods. We have threatened with death any one who shall speak evil of the Christians. As to the Jewish nation which has dared to crucify Jesus, who, as I hear, far from deserving the cross and death, was worthy of honour, worthy of the adoration of men — when I am free from the war with rebellious Spain, I will examine into the matter, and will treat the Jews as they deserve.

<text>is a 1996 kart racing game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 (N64). It is the second main entry in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series and is the successor to &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; (1992) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in Japan on December 14, 1996, and in North America and Europe in 1997. It was released for the iQue Player in China on December 25, 2003. It was released on the Wii&#x27;s and Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2007 and 2016, and on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on October 25, 2021.

Players control one of eight &quot;Mario&quot; franchise characters, who race around 16 tracks (four in each of four cups) with items that can either harm opponents or aid the user. Changes from the original include introducing 3D computer graphics for track design, and four-player support. The characters and items remain 2D sprites, but 3D track features include elevation, bridges, walls, and pits. The game was commercially successful and was generally praised for the fun and high replay value of its multiplayer modes. It is regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; is a kart racing game in which the player controls one of eight selectable &quot;Mario&quot; characters in several racetracks that vary in shape and theme. During a race, the players can obtain random items from special boxes placed in different areas of the track that are used to impede the opposition and gain the advantage. For example, Koopa Troopa shells and bananas allow the player to attack opponents and slow them down, and Mushrooms grant the player a temporary boost in speed and jumping ability. In a change from the previous installment, players can carry more than one item at a time. &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; has 16 racing tracks divided into four cups with four tracks each. It also has four battle stages for Battle mode. It is the first game in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series that supports drafting.

=== Game modes ===
&quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; has four game modes: Grand Prix, Time Trial, Versus, and Battle. Grand Prix mode supports both single-player and competitive multiplayer gameplay, while other modes only support one or the other.
* Grand Prix mode has one or two players participate in four consecutive three-lap races, each on a different course, on one of the four selectable cups (Mushroom, Flower, Star, or Special) against seven (or six) computer players. When the player completes a race, points are awarded based on the rank they finished ranging from first to eighth and the placement order gets carried over to the next race as the new starting grid. If the player ranks 5th or under, the player must restart the race. Unlike the original &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, the player can restart an unlimited number of times, instead of only being allowed three restarts. After finishing all four races in each cup, trophies are awarded to the players who scored the highest accumulation of points: bronze for third place, silver for second, and gold for first. The award ceremony takes place at Peach&#x27;s castle in Royal Raceway, the third race of the Star Cup. Difficulty level is measured by engine size: 50, 100, or 150cc. There is an additional unlockable difficulty called &quot;Extra&quot;, which allows players to race at speed 100cc on tracks that are inverted left-to-right. This is the first game in the series to provide this feature. Later installments call this feature &quot;Mirror Mode&quot; in which players race on horizontally-flipped tracks at speed 150cc.
* Time Trial is a single-player-only mode with the objective of completing a three-lap race on the selected track in the fastest total time. There are no opponent racers or item boxes, though the player will always begin each race with a Triple Mushroom in reserve. For any given course, the top five fastest total times are saved, and the fastest single lap time of any race is also saved. The player can select to race against a ghost character, who will mimic the movement of the player from a previous race. Ghost data for up to two different courses can be saved permanently only on a Controller Pak device. However, the Virtual Console version of &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; released on the Wii is incompatible with the device and is thus unable to save ghost data.
* Versus mode has two to four players competing in single races on any track without any computer players. With two players, the total number of wins for each player is tracked, and in three- or four-player races, the number of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place wins is tracked for each racer.
* Battle mode supports two to four players, and the last man standing objective has players attack each other with items inside one of four selectable arena courses. The players begin a match with three balloons attached to each of their karts. A player will lose one balloon each time their character is damaged by coming into contact with one of the other players&#x27; offending items, and is eliminated from play upon losing all balloons. The match ends when one player remains, who is then declared the winner. In three- or four-player matches, the first two players&#x27; characters to lose all their balloons will transform into mobile &quot;Mini Bomb Karts&quot; and forfeit the ability to win the match. The Mini Bomb Kart is still maneuverable by the player and can collide and inflict damage on another player only once, after which it can no longer participate.
The racetrack map with players&#x27; locations can be viewed as a miniature map, rectangular progress bar (&quot;Rank Data&quot;), or a speedometer can be shown instead. On Yoshi Valley, the second race of the Special Cup, the rectangular progress bar does not identify characters due to the vagueness of the course&#x27;s paths.

=== Playable characters ===
&quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; features eight playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Bowser, Wario and Donkey Kong. The characters are divided into three weight classes: lightweights, whose karts have the highest acceleration and top speed in trade for low weight; heavyweights, whose karts have higher weight to knock around players and lose less speed while turning, but suffer from slightly lower top speed and acceleration; and middleweights, who have mediocre acceleration and the same top speed as the heavyweights, but have much better control of steering. The game was originally to feature the character Kamek, a villainous character from &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, before being replaced by Donkey Kong.

== Development ==
Production began in 1995 with the title &quot;Super Mario Kart R&quot;, where the &quot;R&quot; means &quot;rendered&quot;. The game was developed concurrently with &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, intended to be a launch game for the Nintendo 64, but more resources were given to the other two. &quot;Mario&quot; series creator Shigeru Miyamoto acted as producer and often consulted with game director Hideki Konno. Some early footage of the game was showcased briefly at the Shoshinkai Software Exhibition in Japan on November 24, 1995. Miyamoto stated that the game was 95% complete, but Nintendo chose not to display a playable version due to the difficult logistics of demonstrating the multiplayer features. The prototype featured the Feather item from &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; and a Magikoopa as one of the eight playable characters, who was replaced with Donkey Kong in the final game.

The player&#x27;s driving controls were designed to be similar to operating a radio-controlled car. &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; features tracks that are fully rendered in 3D, and to display the characters and items through the use of Advanced Character Modeling (ACM), the MIPS CPU, and Silicon Graphics workstations. Konno stated that, though rendering the characters as 3D models was not impossible, the display of eight simultaneous 3D characters would have exceeded the processing power of the console. Instead, the characters are composed of pre-rendered sprites that show the characters from various angles to simulate a 3D appearance, similar to &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, and &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot;. Rare, developer of the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; games, provided Donkey Kong&#x27;s character model. Halfway into the game&#x27;s production, the developers suffered a hard disk crash, causing the original character models to become lost. They were forced to remake &quot;about 80%&quot; of the character models, and updated the character select screen to have them animated instead of still, which was not in the original plans.

The technique of rubber band AI prevents all the racers from easily separating, and the Spiny Shell item, which targets and attacks the player in first place, was added in order to keep each race competitive and balanced. The item was included in all subsequent &quot;Mario Kart&quot; games.

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack for &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; was composed by Kenta Nagata, which is his first work on a Nintendo game. The soundtrack was released several times in different formats including compact disc and audio cassette. Four different versions of the album were released: &quot;Race Tracks&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits Soundtrack&quot; in North America; &quot;Original Soundtrack&quot; and &quot;Club Circuit&quot; were released in Japan. It was later released in a three disc collection, along with the soundtracks of &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; and &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

== Release ==
In addition to the regular release in Japan, Nintendo released a &quot;limited edition&quot; which was the regular cartridge bundled with a black-and-grey Nintendo 64 controller. The Japanese release in December 1996 was followed by a U.S. release in February 1997. Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln stated that in addition to the time needed for the localization, &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; was more critical to the Japanese market, as there were fewer N64 games available in that market at the time. It was released in the United Kingdom on June 24, 1997.

&quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; was released as a downloadable Virtual Console game on the Wii in January 2007 and on the Wii U in December 2016. In October 2021, Nintendo also ported the game to Nintendo Switch Online.

During the first three months of 1997, &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; was the best-selling console game in the United States, with sales of 849,000 units for the period. In Japan it ranked as the 10th best-selling video game in the year 1997, and the highest in Nintendo 64 software. By 2007, approximately 5.5 million copies of &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; had been sold in the United States and 2.24 million in Japan.

== Reception ==

&quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and proved to be a commercial success. Review aggregator Metacritic ranks it as the sixth-highest ranked Nintendo 64 title based on fifteen reviews. It has sold 9.87 million copies worldwide, making it the second-best-selling game on N64.

Critics debated the game&#x27;s presentation and visuals. Supporters felt the game adequately used the power of the N64 (critics from &quot;GamePro&quot; and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;), made the game stand out from others in the racing genre and in the Mario series (&quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Trent Ward), and was an improvement over its 16-bit predecessor (&quot;NintendoLife&quot;″s Corbie Dillard and a reviewer from &quot;GameRevolution&quot;). Carine Barrel from the French &quot;Officiel Nintendo Magazine&quot; enjoyed the game&#x27;s colourful and fluid visuals, adding that its overall presentation likened a &quot;magical&quot; experience. Detractors of the graphics felt they lacked detail (Tom Gulse from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; and Peer Schneider from &quot;IGN&quot;), weren&#x27;t better enough than the previous 16-bit entry (&quot;AllGame&quot;″s Scott McCall and Neil West from &quot;Next Generation&quot;), and failed to fully benefit from the N64&#x27;s power (Francois Caron of &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot;). The use of 2D sprites was a common critique, West arguing that it made the game look 16-bit.

&quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;″s track design and gameplay polarised critics. The game was panned for being un-innovative (Schneider), too easy (Caron), and simple and monotonous (Ward and Nick Ferguson from &quot;Edge&quot;). &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;″s Ed Lomas and &quot;N64 Magazine&quot;″s Jonathan Nash felt that success was too dependent on getting the right power-ups. Morley disliked &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;″s wide, motorway-like track design by saying that it did not provide an &quot;adrenaline filled&quot; experience which players might have hoped for. Critics also found fault in the game&#x27;s use of rubberband difficulty balancing, recognising that it gave the enemy AI an unfair advantage. Technical issues such as poor collision detection and lag in the four-player &quot;Battle Mode&quot; were also noted.

The gameplay did have supporters, who noted its large amount of courses (West, &quot;GamePro&quot;, and &quot;Electric Playground&quot;), found its track designs more detailed and impressive than &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; (Schneider and Diillard), and thought it had a lot of replay value (Caron and &quot;GamePro&quot;). &quot;Hyper&quot;″s David Wildgoose and Jonathan highlighted the flexible turning control with the multiple-angled joystick, calling it &quot;perfect&quot; and true to real-life karts. Jonathan enjoyed the amount of focus and fast reflexes required for the player. Wildgoose reported having many unexpected moments while playing the game due to its &quot;ingeniously fiendish AI&quot; and the boxes containing different power-ups each time they&#x27;re collected. Reviewers, even those lukewarm towards the graphics, positively noted touches such as the 180-degree turns in Bowser&#x27;s Castle, the train tracks on Kalimari Desert, the trucks in Toad&#x27;s Turnpike, the cows in Moo Moo Farm, Peach&#x27;s castle on Royal Raceway, and the sliding penguins in Sherbet Land as highlights, as well as smoke puffs coming out of the kart. Critics found the multiplayer mode to be better than the single player, with Schneider calling it &quot;multi-player mayhem at its best&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named it a runner-up for &quot;Multiplayer Game of the Year&quot; (behind &quot;Saturn Bomberman&quot;) at their 1997 Editors&#x27; Choice Awards.

The game was commercially popular and helped spawn several sequels which have been brought out across generations of Nintendo consoles. &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; placed 17th in &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;″s 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time and 49th in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s 1997 list of the 100 best console games of all time.

In 1998, &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; was nominated for Console Racing Game of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences during the inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards.

== Speedrunning presence ==
In addition to time trial world records, which have been documented practically since the beginning and still persists to this day, &quot;Mario Kart&quot; &quot;64&quot; has a long and rich speedrunning history, often being the subject of speedrunning documentarian Summoning Salt through both methods of competitively playing the game in single-player mode, whose videos on &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; alone have racked up more than 26 million views as of October 2023.

<doc id="73964" wikidata="Q41836" url="?curid=73964" title="Theodosius III">
<text>Theodosius III () was Byzantine emperor from to 25 March 717. Before rising to power and seizing the throne of the Byzantine Empire, he was a tax collector in Adramyttium. In 715, the Byzantine navy and the troops of the Opsician Theme, one of the Byzantine provinces, revolted against Emperor Anastasius II (), acclaiming the reluctant Theodosius as emperor. Theodosius led his troops to Chrysopolis and then Constantinople, the capital, seizing the city in November 715. Anastasius did not surrender until several months later, accepting exile in a monastery in return for safety. Many themes viewed Theodosius to be a puppet of the troops of the Opsician Theme, and his legitimacy was denied by the Anatolics and the Armeniacs under their respective (generals) Leo the Isaurian and Artabasdos.

Leo declared himself emperor in the summer of 716 and allied himself with the Umayyad Caliphate, the Islamic empire; Theodosius sought aid from the Bulgarians under Khan Tervel (), setting a firm border at Thrace and ceding the Zagoria region to the Bulgarians, as well as stipulating the payment of tribute to them. Leo then marched his troops to Constantinople, seizing the city of Nicomedia, and capturing many officials, including Theodosius&#x27; son, also named Theodosius. With his son in captivity, Theodosius took the advice of Patriarch Germanus and the Byzantine Senate, and negotiated with Leo, agreeing to abdicate and recognize Leo as emperor. Leo entered Constantinople and definitively seized power on 25 March 717, allowing Theodosius and his son to retire to a monastery. Exactly when Theodosius died is uncertain, but it may have been on 24 July 754.

==History==
===Background===

After the Umayyad Caliphate was repelled at the first Arab siege of Constantinople (674–678), the Arabs and Byzantines experienced a period of peace between each other. Hostilities were resumed by Byzantine Emperor Justinian II (), resulting in a string of Arab victories. As a consequence, the Byzantines lost control over Armenia and the Caucasian principalities, and the Arabs gradually encroached upon the Byzantine borderlands. Annually, generals from the Caliphate would launch raids into Byzantine territory, seizing fortresses and towns. After 712, the defenses of the Byzantine Empire weakened, as Arab raids penetrated deeper into Byzantine Asia Minor, and Byzantine response to these raids became less common; much of the frontier became depopulated, as the inhabitants were either killed, enslaved, or driven away, a result of this was that many frontier forts, especially in Cilicia, were gradually abandoned. The success of these raids emboldened the Arabs, who prepared for a second assault against Constantinople as early as the reign of Caliph al-Walid I (). After his death, his successor, Sulayman () continued planning the campaign, Sulayman began assembling his forces in late 716, on the plain of Dabiq, north of Aleppo, entrusting the command of these forces to his brother, Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik.

The Slavs and Bulgars also formed a growing threat to the northern frontier of the Byzantine Empire, threatening Byzantine control in the Balkans. During the rule of Byzantine Emperor Philippicus (), in 712, the Bulgarians under Khan Tervel advanced as far as the walls of Constantinople itself, plundering the surrounding country, including villas and estates near the capital, where the Byzantine elites often summered.

Theodosius came to power during a period called the Twenty Years&#x27; Anarchy, defined by struggles between the emperors and the elites, and political instability, with a rapid succession of emperors. The nobles of this time were often natives of Asia Minor, and rarely had a strong agenda beyond preventing the emperors from growing stronger and disrupting the status quo. The Twenty Years&#x27; Anarchy began when Emperor Justinian II was overthrown by Leontius () in 695, ending the Heraclian dynasty, which had retained power for eighty years. During this period of anarchy, seven different emperors took the throne, including a restored Justinian for a time. The modern historian Romilly Jenkins states that between 695 and 717 the only competent emperors were Tiberius III () and Anastasius II (). The crisis was ended by Emperor Leo III (), who overthrew Theodosius, and whose dynasty reigned for 85 years.

===Rise to the throne===
Sulayman&#x27;s preparations, including his construction of a war fleet, were quickly noticed by the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Anastasius II began making preparations to defend against this new onslaught. This included sending the patrician and urban prefect, Daniel of Sinope, to spy on the Arabs, under the pretense of a diplomatic embassy, as well as shoring up the defences of Constantinople, and strengthening the Byzantine navy. The 9th-century Byzantine historian Theophanes states that in early 715 Anastasius II had commanded the navy to gather at Rhodes to then advance to Phoenix. It was there that the troops of the Opsician Theme mutinied against their commander, John the Deacon, killing him before sailing for Adramyttium, in southwestern Asia Minor, and there declared Theodosius, a tax collector, as Emperor Theodosius III. The &quot;Zuqnin Chronicle&quot; states that Theodosius ruled under the regnal name Constantine, his full name being &quot;Theodosius Constantinus&quot;. The historian J. B. Bury suggests that he was selected at random for little more than the fact that he already had an imperial-sounding name, was inoffensive, obscure but respectable, and could easily be controlled by the Opsicians. Graham Sumner, a Byzantologist, suggests that Theodosius might be the same person as Theodosius, the son of Emperor Tiberius III, therefore explaining why he might have been chosen by the troops, as he would have legitimacy from his father, himself made emperor by a naval revolt. Theodosius, the son of Tiberius, was bishop of Ephesus by , and held this position until his death, sometime around 24 July 754, and was a leading figure of the iconoclastic Council of Hieria in 754. Byzantine historians Cyril Mango and Roger Scott do not view this theory as likely, as it would mean that Theodosius lived for thirty more years after his abdication. Cyril Mango proposed that it was actually Theodosius III&#x27;s son who became bishop, rather than the son of Tiberius.

Theodosius was allegedly unwilling to be emperor and according to Theophanes:
He was acclaimed as Emperor Theodosius III by the troops of the Opsician Theme at Adramyttium in May 715. Anastasius led his army into Bithynia in the Opsician Theme to crush the rebellion. Rather than remaining to fight Anastasius, Theodosius led his fleet to Chrysopolis, across the Bosporus from Constantinople. From Chrysopolis, he launched a six-month-long siege of Constantinople, before supporters within the capital managed to open the gates for him, allowing him to seize the city in November 715. Anastasius remained at Nicaea for several months, before finally agreeing to abdicate and retire to a monastery.

===Reign===

One of Theodosius&#x27; first acts as emperor was to reinstate the depiction of the Sixth Ecumenical Synod in the Great Palace of Constantinople, which Emperor Philippicus Bardanes had removed, earning himself the epithet of &quot;Orthodox&quot; in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; for this action. Theodosius, whom Byzantine sources convey as being both unwilling and incapable, was viewed by many of his subjects as a puppet emperor of the troops of the Opsician Theme. Thus he was not recognized as legitimate by the Anatolic and the Armeniac Themes, under their respective (generals) Leo the Isaurian and Artabasdos. Although they had not taken any action to prevent the overthrowal of Anastasius, they took issue with Theodosius&#x27; ascension, and Leo proclaimed himself Byzantine emperor in the summer of 716. He also sought the support of the Arabs, who viewed the Byzantine disunity as advantageous, and thought the confusion would weaken the Byzantine Empire and make it easier to take Constantinople. Theodosius negotiated a treaty with the Bulgarian khan Tervel (), likely to secure his support against an imminent Arab attack. The treaty fixed the border between the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire at Thrace, ceding the Zagoria region to the Bulgarians, as well as stipulating the payment of tribute to the Bulgarians, the return of fugitives, and some trade agreements.

Around this time, Sulayman had begun advancing into Byzantine territory, laying siege to Amorium, and a separate force entered Cappadocia. Negotiations with Leo led them to withdraw. Leo began to march his troops to Constantinople soon after declaring himself emperor, first capturing Nicomedia, where he found and captured, among other officials, Theodosius&#x27; son, and then marched to Chrysopolis. After his son was captured, Theodosius, taking the advice of Patriarch Germanus and the Byzantine Senate, agreed to abdicate and recognize Leo as emperor. Bury states that the elite of Constantinople, who might otherwise have sided with the inoffensive Theodosius, who would be unlikely to politically weaken them, sided with Leo, as Theodosius was not competent enough to deal with the Arab threat. He further states that the meeting of the Patriarch, senate, and chief officials, which chose Leo over Theodosius, was done with the knowledge and consent of Theodosius himself, who accepted the decision. Bury postulates that, without the threat of the Arabs, it is possible that Theodosius may have retained power, and a succession of nominal emperors might have followed him, controlled by court officials and the elites.

Leo entered Constantinople and definitively seized power on 25 March 717, allowing Theodosius and his son, also named Theodosius, to retire to a monastery as monks. After his retirement to a monastery, Theodosius might have become the bishop of Ephesus, if he was the same person as Theodosius, son of Tiberius, in , and, if he is the same, died on 24 July 754 according to Sumner. Either he or his son is buried in the Church of St. Philip in Ephesus. Little is known of the reign of Theodosius III.

<text>Sozopol ( ; ) is an ancient seaside town located 35 km south of Burgas on the southern Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. One of the major seaside resorts in the country, it is known for the &quot;Apollonia&quot; art and film festival (which takes place in early September) that is named after one of the town&#x27;s ancient names. Part of Burgas Province and administrative centre of the homonymous Sozopol Municipality, as of December 2009, the town has a population of 5,410 inhabitants.

In antiquity, the place was the site of a prosperous Greek colony named &quot;Antheia&quot; and later known as &quot;Apollonia.&quot; In 72 BC it was devastated by a Roman siege, and became a small town of lesser importance. By the first century AD, the name &quot;Sozopolis&quot; began to appear in written records.

The busiest times of the year are the summer months, ranging from May to September, as tourists from around the world come to enjoy the weather, sandy beaches, history and culture, fusion cuisine (Balkan and Mediterranean), and atmosphere of the colourful resort.

==Name==
The original name of the city is attested as &quot;Antheia&quot; (Ἄνθεια in Greek) but was soon renamed to &quot;Apollonia&quot; (Ἀπολλωνία). At various times, Apollonia was known as &quot;Apollonia Pontica&quot; (Ἀπολλωνία ἡ Ποντική, that is, &quot;Apollonia on the Black Sea&quot;, the ancient &quot;Pontus Euxinus&quot;) and &quot;Apollonia Magna&quot; (&quot;Great Apollonia&quot;). By the first century AD, the name &quot;Sozopolis&quot; (Σωζόπολις) began to appear in written records. During the Ottoman rule which began in 1453, the town was known as &quot;Sizebolu&quot;, &quot;Sizeboli&quot; or &quot;Sizebolou&quot;.

==History==
===Antiquity===

Sozopol is one of the oldest towns on Bulgarian Thrace&#x27;s Black Sea coast. The first settlement on the site dates back to the Bronze Age. Undersea explorations in the region of the port reveal relics of dwellings, ceramic pottery, stone and bone tools from that era. Many anchors from the second and first millennium BC have been discovered in the town&#x27;s bay, a proof of active shipping since ancient times.

The town was founded in the 7th century BC by ancient Greek colonists from Miletus as Antheia (). The town established itself as a trade and naval centre in the following centuries and became one of the largest and richest Greek colonies in the Black Sea region. Its trade influence in the Thracian territories was based on a treaty dating from the fifth century BC with the Odrysian kingdom, the most powerful Thracian state. The town&#x27;s name was changed to Apollonia, on account of a temple dedicated to Apollo in the town. Apollonia became a legendary trading rival of another Greek colony, Mesembria, today&#x27;s Nessebar.

There were two temples of Apollo Iatros (), meaning healer in Greek. One was from the Late Archaic Greece and the other from the Early Classical Greece.
It kept strong political and trade relations with the cities of Ancient Greece – Miletus, Athens, Corinth, Heraclea Pontica and the islands Rhodes, Chios, Lesbos, etc.

The city managed to keep its independence during the wars of Philip II of Macedon (342–339 BC) and Alexander the Great (335 BC).

In 72 BC it was conquered and sacked by the Roman legions of Marcus Lucullus, with the latter ordering its devastation. Lucullus transported the statue of Apollo to Rome and placed it in the Capitol. Apollonia did not recover from the disaster, remaining a small town without any significant trade or cultural importance during the Roman period (1st to 3rd centuries AD).
Apollonia Pontica started minting its own coins at the end of the 6th century BC, the anchor appearing on them as the symbol of the polis present on all coins minted since the sixth century BC, proof of the importance of its maritime trade. Coins from the fourth century BC bear the name Apollonia and the image of Apollo. The Roman imperial coins continue to the first half of the third century AD.

The &quot;Tabula Peutinger&quot; shows Apollonia; but the &quot;Periplus Ponti Euxini&quot;, 85, and the &quot;Notitiæ episcopatuum&quot; have only the later name Sozopolis.

===Later periods===
In 1328 Cantacuzene (ed. Bonn, I, 326) speaks of it as a large and populous town. The islet on which it stood is now connected with the mainland by a narrow tongue of land. Ruled in turn by the Byzantine, Bulgarian and Ottoman Empires, Sozopol was assigned to the newly independent Principality of Bulgaria in the 19th century. A group of Polish Armenians, expelled by the Ottoman occupiers from Kamieniec Podolski in 1674, stayed in the city for a single winter before returning to Poland.

At the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) prominent local personalities like Dimitrios Varis were arrested and executed by the Ottoman authorities due to participation in the preparations of the struggle.
According to the Bulgarian jurist and politician Vasil Mitakov (1881–1945), the town was almost entirely ethnically Greek in the first decade of the 20th century, with the exception of a few dozen Bulgarians in the whole city who were either current or retired officials. After the anti-Greek pogroms in Bulgaria in 1906, Greek institutions in the city were closed and expropriated, including the churches, the library and the Greek school. Almost all of its remaining Greek population was exchanged with Bulgarians from Eastern Thrace in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars. In 2011 the remainings of an ancient Greek settlement, part of Apollonia, were excavated in the small island of St. Kirik (Saint Cerycus) off Sozopolis.

Since 1984 Sozopol hosts the &quot;Apollonia&quot; art festivities every September, which include theatre shows, exhibitions, movies, musical and dance performances, book presentations and other cultural events.

===Colossal statue of Apollo===
The city erected, in 5th century BC, a colossal statue of the god Apollo which was tall. It was created by the sculptor Calamis. In 72 BC, the Romans under Marcus Lucullus captured the city and moved the sculpture to Rome on the Capitolium. Pliny the Elder wrote that the statue cost 500 talents. It was lost during the Early Christian period.

===Archaeology===
Recent excavations have revealed parts of the ancient city including:
* A temple complex (late 6th - early 5th century BC) presumably belonging to the famous temple of Apollo;
* An oval altar and a temple from the Hellenistic period (4th century BC);
* A tholos
* A copper foundry

In addition, archaeologists discovered a Greek bucranium amulet from the 5th century BC.
A shrine of goddesses Demeter and Persephone from the 6th century BC.

Many objects from antiquity, included imported luxury ceramics, red-figure pottery, sgraffito pottery, pottery lamps, loom weights, spindle parts, coins, amphora seals, arrow coins, ceramic game pieces, adornments. One of the most impressive finds was an Attica red-figure pottery krater, depicting the myth about Oedipus and the Sphinx. The krater is dated to the second quarter of the 5th century BC.
Excavation teams also discovered, a ceramic askos dated back to the second half of the 6th century BC, and was “made in the tradition of grey monochrome Aeolian pottery&quot;, a 6th-century BC home and other antiquity buildings, pottery and coins from both the antiquity period and the Middle Ages. Furthermore, have also identified the ruins of a medieval Christian chapel and have discovered several graves from a medieval necropolis that was used in two time periods – in the 11th century AD and then again in the 13th – 14th century AD. In a grave from the 11th century, the researchers have found two small crosses – one made of bronze and another one made of bone. They have also discovered three pits hewn into the rocks from the Classical Period of Ancient Greece containing materials from the 5th – 4th century BC.

Later, they discovered an ancient metallurgical plant from the 6th century BC located at an antiquity copper mine. While the ancient copper mining near Sozopol has been well researched, for the first time archaeologists have discovered ceramic kilns for melting the copper ore right on the edge of the mine in what resembles an Antiquity metallurgy facility.

In 2021, archaeologists discovered a terracotta relief fragment, depicting marching Greek hoplites. The relief is a piece of a larger depiction, other parts of which were discovered in 2018 and 2019.

===Ecclesiastical history===

Sozopol was Christianized early. Bishops are recorded as resident there from at least 431. At least eight bishops are known: Athanasius (431), Peter (680), Euthymius (787) and Ignatius (869); Theodosius (1357), Joannicius, who became Patriarch of Constantinople (1524), Philotheus (1564) and Joasaph (1721).

From being suffragan to the archbishopric of Adrianople, it became in the 14th century a metropolitan see without suffragan sees; it perhaps temporarily disappeared with the Turkish conquest, but reappeared later; in 1808 the Greek Orthodox Church united it to the see of Agathopolis. The titular resided at Agathopolis.

Eubel (&quot;Hierarchia catholica medii ævi&quot;, I, 194) mentions four Latin bishops of the 14th century.
The bishopric is included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees as &quot;Sozopolis in Haemimonto&quot; and as a suffragan of &quot;Hadrianopolis in Haemimonto&quot;.

Art flourished in the Christian era. The ancient icons and magnificent woodcarving in the iconostases are a remarkable accomplishment of the craftsmanship of these times. The architecture of the houses in the old town from the Renaissance period makes it a unique place to visit today.

===The vampire of Sozopol===
During archaeological excavations in 2012 the remains of a skeleton pierced with an iron bar in the heart were found. It is believed that those are the remains of the local nobleman Krivich (or Krivitsa), ruler of the fortress of Sozopol (castrofilax). Believed to be a very cruel person, the locals made sure that he would not come back to haunt the city after his death by piercing him with an iron bar in the chest. There are more than 100 medieval funerals similar to that of Krivitsa found all over Bulgaria. The remains were pierced with either an iron or a wooden bar through the chest to make sure that the dead will not rise from the grave as a vampire.

<doc id="73970" wikidata="Q1141493" url="?curid=73970" title="The Heiress">
<text>The Heiress is a 1949 American romantic drama film directed and produced by William Wyler, from a screenplay written by Ruth and Augustus Goetz, adapted from their 1947 stage play of the same title, which was itself adapted from Henry James&#x27; 1880 novel &quot;Washington Square&quot;. The film stars Olivia de Havilland as Catherine Sloper, a naive young woman who falls in love with a handsome young man despite the objections of her emotionally abusive father who suspects the man of being a fortune hunter. Montgomery Clift stars as Morris Townsend, and Ralph Richardson as Dr. Sloper.

&quot;The Heiress&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on October 6, 1949, and was theatrically released by Paramount Pictures on December 28, 1949. Although a box office failure, grossing $2.3 million on a $2.6 million budget, the film garnered critical acclaim, with reviewers praising Wyler&#x27;s direction, its screenplay and the performances of the cast. The film received a leading eight nominations at the 22nd Academy Awards, including for the Best Picture, and won four awards (more than any other film nominated that year): Best Actress (for de Havilland), Best Original Score, composed by Aaron Copland, Best Production Design, and Best Costume Design.

In 1996, &quot;The Heiress&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Universal Pictures, through its EMKA division, currently handles distribution of the film.

==Plot==
In 1849 New York City, Catherine Sloper, a plain and shy young woman, lives with her wealthy father, Dr. Austin Sloper, in the prestigious Washington Square. Catherine&#x27;s mother, who was charming and talented, died early, and quiet Catherine constantly disappoints her father with her lack of social graces. Catherine&#x27;s widowed Aunt Lavinia Penniman moves in and suggests she help Catherine improve her social skills.

At a ball, Catherine meets Morris Townsend, a handsome and charming, but poor, young man. Morris, encouraged by Aunt Penniman, pursues Catherine ardently, and she quickly falls in love with him. Catherine accepts and blossoms under Morris&#x27;s courtship, but Dr. Sloper suspects Morris is a fortune hunter only interested in his plain daughter&#x27;s wealth, and investigations into Morris&#x27;s family relations confirm Dr. Sloper&#x27;s poor opinion.

When Morris formally requests Catherine&#x27;s hand in marriage, Catherine is elated, but Dr. Sloper refuses. Dr. Sloper vows he will disinherit Catherine if she marries Morris without his blessing and arranges to take her on an extended trip to Europe to separate the pair as a &#x27;test&#x27;. Catherine is torn by her desire for her father&#x27;s approval, but is becoming more and more eager to marry Morris regardless and become independent.

Morris convinces Catherine to wait and earn Dr. Sloper&#x27;s approval during this separation and promises to remain true while she is away. During Catherine and Dr. Sloper&#x27;s European trip, Morris frequently visits the Sloper home and behaves with proprietary ownership over the property and personal contents of the house.

Dr. Sloper is disappointed his daughter does not gain any sophistication from the trip and remains devoted to Morris. Upon their return home, he reveals his poor opinion of his child at last and cruelly belittles his daughter&#x27;s lack of intelligence, beauty, and accomplishment, making it clear he views her as impossible to be attractive to a man outside of her inheritance.

Wounded and angry, Catherine becomes determined to prove her father wrong and elope with Morris. She runs to Morris and begs him to arrange their immediate elopement. Certain Morris loves her and wanting to cut free from her father, she tells him about her pending disinheritance as they discuss the details of her sneaking out to meet him, and makes it clear they can expect nothing from her father ever again.

Catherine waits with her bags packed, and Aunt Penniman, who helped facilitate the plans, offers to stay with her, but is dismayed that Catherine stupidly revealed there would be no money from her father. Aunt Penniman believes Morris is Catherine&#x27;s only chance at marriage, and that it would be best if they got married first and then dealt with the aftermath.

As the appointed time comes and passes without Morris&#x27;s arrival, Catherine realizes that Morris has abandoned her upon learning she will not inherit her father&#x27;s wealth and brokenly returns to her room.

Shortly afterward, Dr. Sloper reveals he is dying. Because he was initially proud of Catherine for rejecting Morris, Catherine at last gets her revenge on him by denying him the ability to die peacefully. In a bitter argument, Catherine tells him she planned to elope and was rejected and says he has cheated her by denying her even the chance to &#x27;buy&#x27; a husband who would pretend to love her. If he leaves her his money, she might waste it on Morris or other fortune hunters. Dr. Sloper dies fretting until his last breath on whether to change his will, but ultimately cannot bring himself to disinherit his only child.

Years later, wealthy, independent, and single, Catherine still lives in the Washington Square house with her aunt. Aunt Penniman informs Catherine that Morris has returned from California. Initially reluctant, Catherine eventually agrees to see him. Morris, now destitute, attempts to win Catherine back. Catherine proposes they recreate their failed elopement. When Morris returns to take her away, Catherine refuses to let him in, leaving him pounding helplessly on the door as she turns off the lights and goes to bed.

==Production==
After seeing &quot;The Heiress&quot; on Broadway, Olivia de Havilland approached William Wyler about directing her in a screen adaptation of the play. He agreed and encouraged executives at Paramount Pictures to purchase the rights from the playwrights (Ruth and Augustus Goetz) for $250,000 and offer them $10,000 per week to write the screenplay. The couple were asked to make Morris less of a villain than he was in their play and the original novel in deference to the studio&#x27;s desire to capitalize on Montgomery Clift&#x27;s reputation as a romantic leading man.

The film premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on October 6, 1949.

Ralph Richardson reprised the role of Austin Sloper in a London production of the play.

==Reception==
&quot;The Heiress&quot; received universal critical acclaim. When it premiered at Radio City Music Hall, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;crackles with allusive life and fire in its tender and agonized telling of an extraordinarily characterful tale&quot; and added Wyler &quot;has given this somewhat austere drama an absorbing intimacy and a warming illusion of nearness that it did not have on the stage. He has brought the full-bodied people very closely and vividly to view, while maintaining the clarity and sharpness of their personalities, their emotions and their styles...&quot;The Heiress&quot; is one of the handsome, intense and adult dramas of the year.&quot;

The &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; found the film &quot;an intensely satisfying drama that holds a high level of interest throughout, building relentlessly to a moving climax.&quot; Praise for the principals lauded de Havilland especially: &quot;the transformation of Catherine Sloper from a pathetically shy girl to a cold, handsome woman&quot; being &quot;handled with finished skill.&quot;

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; praised the Goetzes for a skillful transformation of their stage version, finding it &quot;in almost every way...superior.&quot; Prospects of an Academy Award for de Havilland were judged &quot;thoroughly reasonable&quot; as well.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; rates the film five out of a possible five stars and adds, &quot;This powerful and compelling drama...owes its triumph to the deft hand of director William Wyler and a remarkable lead performance by Olivia de Havilland&quot;.

&quot;Time Out London&quot; calls the film &quot;typically plush, painstaking and cold...highly professional and heartless.&quot;

Channel 4 stated &quot;de Havilland&#x27;s portrayal...is spine-chilling...Clift brings a subtle ambiguity to one of his least interesting roles, and Richardson is also excellent.&quot;

==Influence==
Martin Scorsese has cited &quot;The Heiress&quot; as a key influence on his 2023 film &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot;. Specifically, the portrayal of Mollie Kyle and her relationship with her husband Ernest Burkhart drew inspiration from de Havilland&#x27;s portrayal of Catherine and her relationship with Morris.

==In popular culture==
In 1975, the twenty-first episode of the eighth season of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; featured a take-off of the film titled &quot;The Lady Heir&quot;, with Carol Burnett as Catherine and Roddy McDowall as Morris.

The film&#x27;s Philippine adaptation, titled &quot;Ikaw Pa Lang ang Minahal&quot;, was made in 1992. The adaptation was written by Raquel Villavicencio, produced by Armida Siguion-Reyna, and directed by Carlos Siguion-Reyna. The film stars Maricel Soriano and Richard Gomez as Adela and David.

<text>Hell&#x27;s Hinges is a 1916 American silent Western film starring William S. Hart and Clara Williams. Directed by Charles Swickard, William S. Hart and Clifford Smith, and produced by Thomas H. Ince, the screenplay was written by C. Gardner Sullivan.

In 1994, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Hinges&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, and is considered by some to be one of the finest silent Westerns.

==Plot==

&quot;Hell&#x27;s Hinges&quot; tells the story of a weak-willed minister, Rev. Bob Henley (played by Standing), who comes to a wild and debauched frontier town with his sister, Faith (played by Williams). The owner of the saloon, Silk Miller (played by Hollingsworth), and his accomplices sense trouble and encourage the local rowdies to disrupt the attempts to evangelize the community. Hard-bitten gunman Blaze Tracy (played by Hart), the most dangerous man around, is, however, won over by the sincerity of Faith. He intervenes to expel the rowdies from the newly built church.

Silk adopts a new approach. He encourages the dance-hall girl, Dolly (played by Glaum), to seduce Rev. Henley. She gets him drunk, and he spends the night in her room. The following morning the whole town learns of his fall from grace. Blaze rides out to find a doctor for the now near-demented minister.

The disgraced minister, having rapidly descended into alcoholism, is goaded into helping the rowdy element to burn down the church. The church-goers try to defend the church, and a gunfight erupts in which the minister is killed and the church set ablaze. Blaze returns too late to stop the destruction. In revenge, Blaze kills Silk and burns down the whole town, beginning with the saloon. He and Faith leave to start a new life.

==Critical reception==

===Initial reviews in 1916===

When &quot;Hell&#x27;s Hinges&quot; was released, the reception of the film among New York critics was so positive that the producer bought space in newspapers around the country to reprint the reviews. The following are excerpts from those reviews:
* &quot;New York Telegraph&quot;: &quot;Dramatic suspense and punch, coupled with artistic treatment, are the most conspicuous characteristics of &#x27;Hell&#x27;s Hinges&#x27; ... [A] swaggering, hard-drinking, fast-shooting, all-round &#x27;bad&#x27; man, with good stuff under a rough exterior, furnished Mr. Hart with a vehicle in which his talents show to best advantage.&quot;
* &quot;New York American&quot;: &quot;A well-balanced supporting cast, a lavish production and marked finesse in treatment combines to make &#x27;Hell&#x27;s Hinges&#x27; an unusual offering.&quot;
* &quot;New York Press&quot;: &quot;Gunplay and religion lubricate &#x27;Hell&#x27;s Hinges&#x27; ... It is a film drama that combines all the elements that make for success ... Reckless riding, double-handed shooting from the hip, a dance hall of the Bret Harte description and, finally a conflagration that gives a truly Gehenna-like finish to the place known as Hell&#x27;s Hinges ... No actor before the screen has been able to give as sincere and true a touch to the Westerner as Hart. He rides in a manner indigenous to the soil, he shoots with the real knack and he acts with that sense of artistry that hides the acting.&quot; 
* &quot;New York Sun&quot;: &quot;It depicts strikingly the storm and stress of existence in a Western town with a final scene of the shooting up of a gambling den, which aroused the spectators to a high degree of approval.&quot;
* &quot;New York Herald&quot;: &quot;William S. Hart is beginning to typify certain things in the film world. He is ever stoical, slow to anger, but possessed of the powers of a hundred men when aroused. He is a big, bluff, wholesome fellow, whose ideas are frequently a little peculiar, and he goes about matters in exclusively his own way. But when the showdown arrives, depend upon it, William S. Hart will be found lined up on the side of righteousness. This week, for example, Hart is appearing at the Knickerbocker Theatre in &#x27;Hell&#x27;s Hinges. Hart has the opportunity to do some good riding, to carry a drunken minister on his back, to shoot the villain and some sub-villains, to set the town afire and to marry the minister&#x27;s sister. The Kaiser himself has appeared in pictures and done less.&quot;
* &quot;New York Herald&quot;: &quot;&#x27;Hell&#x27;s Hinges,&#x27; one of those traditional places on the frontier of the Wild West, &#x27;where there ain&#x27;t no Ten Commandments and a man can get a thirst,&#x27; was pictured in the most lurid manner.&quot;

Grace Kingsley of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the actors high marks. She credited Hart with doing his &quot;usual excellent work&quot; and found Glaum to be &quot;a really fascinating vampire.&quot; Kingsley paid special note to Standing&#x27;s performance as the reverend, calling it &quot;one of the most subtle, but at the same time of the most sincere bits of film acting of his entire career,&quot; a performance exhibiting &quot;intelligence and imagination ... in the very highest degree.&quot; Kingsley found the film to be &quot;marvelously well done&quot; but took exception to the would-be folksy western dialect in the title cards:

C. Gardner Sullivan appears to have written &#x27;Hell&#x27;s Hinges&#x27; for the purpose of allowing us to look our fill on fire and fights. Certain it is the thing is marvelously well done. There is a burning dance hall with men and women entrapped, which fairly makes you gasp, and there is a &#x27;beau-oo-tiful&#x27; free-for-all fight between the sheep and the goats of &#x27;Hell&#x27;s Hinges.&#x27; All this is lovely enough in its way to make for forgiveness of the dialect of the subtitles, a dialect which &#x27;never was on land or sea.&#x27;

The title cards includes lines such as &quot;When women like her say there is a God, there is one, and he sure must be worth trailin&#x27; with&quot;.

The publication &quot;Moving Picture World&quot; gave the film a mixed review:&quot;... William S. Hart should try himself out in some other role, or, at least, in some more decided variation of story in which he quite regularly appears. Then, too, he might well be a little more human and less heroic with no loss of sympathy in the average audience. The old fashioned theatrical hero fails to win with a large percentage of the modern audience... Brilliant in subtitle, strong in treatment with occasional notes of true pathos, the marks of creative ability and sure craftmanship are there, but more of the material is outworn--the genius of author and director barely save it--and the fire scenes, elaborate as they are, finally cause interest to flag from too much repetition... The cast is without flaw.&quot;The publication further noted that Ince &quot;is at his best when holding close to revelations of the human mind and heart.&quot;

===Later historical assessments===
In September 1994, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Hinges&quot; experienced a revival following a screening at the Film Center of the School of the Chicago Art Institute. At the time, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s movie critic, Michael Wilmington, called &quot;Hell&#x27;s Hinges&quot; &quot;Hart&#x27;s acknowledged masterpiece,&quot; &quot;perhaps the finest movie Western made before John Ford&#x27;s 1939 &quot;Stagecoach&quot;,&quot; and &quot;as emotionally powerful as any American Western film of the teens, except for the masterpieces of D.W. Griffith and Erich Von Stroheim.&quot;

Two months after the showing in Chicago and Wilmington&#x27;s review, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

In 1997, &quot;Film Comment&quot; published a review calling &quot;Hell&#x27;s Hinges&quot; a &quot;classic of its kind&quot; and arguing that &quot;to dismiss it casually as a western would be a mistake, for it more resembles &quot;The Atonement of Gosta Berling&quot; than it does &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot;. The reviewer gave particular praise to Hart&#x27;s directorial skill:

The camera placement here, the simple yet effective symbolism, and the flair for spectacle as in the brilliantly handled mob scenes where all of Inceville goes up in smoke, the real &#x27;feel&#x27; of the old, dusty, unglamorised West, all should have earned Hart a reputation as one of the great directors. ... For the most part, &#x27;Hell&#x27;s Hinges&#x27; offers highpowered drama rather than traditional western action. ... Fine camerawork utilising long panoramic shots, excellent cutting and a sure control over the masses of extras fuse this into an episode of astonishing vigor. Hart, his assistant Cliff Smith, his writer Gardner Sullivan and cameraman Joe August were one of the sturdiest (and least appreciated) teams of craftsmen the cinema ever produced.

The film was given a centenary screening at the Museum of Modern Art in January 2016. In a capsule review for the occasion, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s Richard Brody praised the film for its uncommon intensity: &quot;The images are as direct and bare as the characters&#x27; emotions, and the harsh drama builds to a mad, apocalyptic climax of crime and revenge.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In 2009, the band Caledonia Mission wrote a song for &quot;Esopus&quot; magazine inspired by the movie. The song is named &quot;The Ballad of Blaze Tracy.&quot;

<doc id="73979" wikidata="Q5765973" url="?curid=73979" title="Hindenburg disaster newsreel footage">
<text>Newsreel footage of the 6 May 1937 &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster, where the zeppelin &quot;LZ 129 Hindenburg&quot; crashed and burned down, was filmed by several companies.

The film is frequently shown with narration, by WLS (AM) announcer Herbert Morrison, who was narrating a field recording on to an acetate disc, and was present to watch the zeppelin&#x27;s arrival. Morrison&#x27;s commentary was recorded by engineer Charles Nehlsen, but not broadcast until the next day on May 7, 1937, one of the first times that recordings of a news event were ever broadcast. In 2002, the audio recording was selected for preservation into the Library of Congress National Recording Registry. It has since been combined with the separately filmed newsreel footage. Most of the original newsreels have their own narration, and many composite edits have been made for documentaries dubbed with Morrison&#x27;s commentary.

Four newsreel teams were in attendance at the time of the disaster. They were positioned close to each other and adjacent to the mooring mast for the airship. As a result, the newsreels do not show the mooring mast for the airship to be moored (other mooring masts appear in the background in many of the reels), unlike many of the press photographs which were taken farther away which show the mast as well as two of the newsreel cameramen with their cameras mounted atop of newsreel trucks. None of the newsreels captured the initial signs of disaster as the cameras had momentarily stopped filming after the ground crew caught the landing ropes (the fire started approximately four minutes after the first starboard rope was dropped at 7:21). At least one amateur film, taken by Harold N. Schenck, is known to exist, showing a side view of the stern on fire and the tail crashing to the ground.

In 1997, the original reels were selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==List of footage==
There are five known newsreels of the fire, released by Pathé News, Paramount News, Movietone News, Hearst &quot;News of the Day&quot;/Universal Newsreel, and the fifth is of unknown origin. In addition, there is one known amateur film, by Harold N. Schenck.

===Pathé===

Cameraman William Deeke filmed the scenes in this newsreel. The footage shows the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; making its final sharp turn to starboard while dropping ballast three times before skidding to port and dropping her landing lines. The narrator describes the Hindenburg as a &quot;puny plaything in the mighty grip of fate&quot;, foreshadowing the stern-heaviness and dumping of water ballast as a &quot;grim note of impending tragedy.&quot; Deeke had focused the camera on the ground crew before he stopped filming. Although his camera was focused on the airship the moment it caught fire, the camera malfunctioned and it became necessary for him to set up a hand crank, which he only started to use when ship&#x27;s tail was on the ground and the side collapsed inward. As a result, the Pathé News reel is actually the shortest in showing the crash. The footage also suffers from slight camera shake. The newsreel was edited to show the ground crew footage prior to the fire with an explosion sound effect, giving the false impression the ship was exploding while the camera was focused to the ground. Two distinct still frames flash to transition between the ground crew scene and the footage of the fire; these appear to be from footage taken earlier of the ship&#x27;s landing approach which was edited out of the final reel.

===Fox Movietone===
The Fox Movietone footage was filmed by Al Gold (who filmed the fire sequence shown in the newsreel), Larry Kennedy and Deon de Titta. Gold stated that he was filming the ground crew when the fire started. However, the Movietone newsreel shows the ground crewmen catching the ropes early on, and it appears Gold&#x27;s camera only started to film the fire as the airship&#x27;s stern touched the ground. Kennedy and de Titta were closer to the airship when the fire started and had to run. Soundman Addison Tice was present as well, and recorded some of the audio of the disaster. Although the explosion sound in the newsreel was simulated, some of the audio may have been from the crash, as someone can be heard saying &quot;you&#x27;re alright now Al!&quot;.

===Universal/&quot;Hearst News of the Day&quot;===
The Universal cameraman stationed at the air field left early due to the bad weather and went to see a Broadway play. However, James J. Seeley filmed the disaster for Hearst&#x27;s &quot;News of the Day&quot; and Universal used his footage of the fire for their report. Both newsreel companies had taken their own aerial footage of the airship over New York hours before the fire. One scene in the Universal reel showing passengers looking out of the windows, was taken from Universal&#x27;s 1936 newsreel of one of the &quot;Hindenburg&#x27;s&quot; previous transatlantic crossings.

This newsreel is the longest in showing the fire sequence. The camera pans upward showing the stern ablaze as it crashes down and the fire burns through the nose like a blowtorch. It does not show what is happening below the burning airship when it crashes to the ground as the camera is focused more on the fire itself until the bow nears the ground. At this point, navy ground crewmen can be seen walking close to the camera.

The &quot;Hearst News of the Day&quot; Newsreel is much less common than the Universal reel. A high quality government archive copy of the Universal version also appeared online (which also includes the Universal Newsreel of the wreckage a few days after, and the Pathé newsreel). Compared to the Universal edit, the Hearst newsreel has some different shots of the airship over New York and also shows footage of passengers inside the ship from 1936. The same narration is used in the Gaumont British News report which uses footage from both Universal/Hearst and Movietone. Another redub of the newsreel is the &quot;Victoria Record&quot;.

===Paramount===
The Paramount was filmed by Tommy Craven using an Eyemo, which had interchangeable lenses. During the landing approach, Craven alternated between wide-angle and telephoto views of the airship. As the ship dropped its ropes another cameraman can be seen. Craven was using the telephoto lens when the fire started (the footage starts a few seconds after the Hearst reel), giving a close-up view of the fire and people running away from the airship. The footage also shows flames burning away the ship&#x27;s name as it crashes to the ground. Craven, an out-of-work news photographer aspiring to become a newsreel cameraman, was given the chance by Paramount to cover the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;″s arrival, which landed him the job at Paramount News. The footage has sometimes been misattributed to Al Mingalone. In 1957, Craven made an appearance in the Canadian game show &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot; recounting his experience filming the disaster.

===Amateur footage===
There is one known amateur film of the disaster, a 25-second 8mm home movie by Harold N. Schenck, giving a side-rear view of the disaster. While it was known by the Lakehurst Historical Society for many years and shown at an event for the 50th anniversary of the disaster, it was not publicly broadcast until May 2014 by NBC. A restoration and analysis of the film was performed for the 2021 &quot;Nova&quot; documentary &quot;Hindenburg: The New Evidence&quot;. While missing the initial stages of the fire, it shows the fire a few seconds earlier than the Universal/Hearst newsreel, seconds before the airship&#x27;s tail started to fall.

<text>Goof Troop is an American animated sitcom produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. The series focuses on the relationship between single father Goofy and his son, Max, as well as their neighbor Pete and his family. Created by Robert Taylor and Michael Peraza Jr., the main series of 65 episodes aired in first-run syndication from 1992 to 1993 on &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; programming block, while an additional thirteen episodes aired on Saturday mornings on ABC. A Christmas special was also produced and aired in syndication in late 1992.

Walt Disney Pictures produced two spin-off films from the television series: the theatrical &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, released on April 7, 1995, and direct-to-video sequel &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;, released on February 29, 2000.

==Premise==
&quot;Goof Troop&quot; is similar to several early-1950s &quot;Goofy&quot; cartoon shorts that depicted Goofy as the father of a mischievous red-haired son. It was the creation of Michael Peraza Jr., and pitched to Disney management as a last-minute idea to fit the title.

Goofy, a single father, moves back to his hometown of Spoonerville with his son, Max, and they end up moving in next door to his high school friend Pete, a used car salesman and owner of Honest Pete&#x27;s Used Cars; Pete&#x27;s wife Peg, a real estate agent; and their two children; their son P.J. (Pete Jr.) and daughter Pistol. Max and P.J. quickly become best friends and do practically everything together. Much of the show&#x27;s humor comes from Max&#x27;s normal personality, which contrasts with his father&#x27;s.

==Broadcast history and feature films==
&quot;Goof Troop&quot; was originally previewed on The Disney Channel from April 20 to July 12 of 1992. Like its predecessors &quot;DuckTales&quot;, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;, &quot;TaleSpin,&quot; and &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; and its successor &quot;Bonkers&quot;, &quot;Goof Troop&quot; was previewed in syndication on September 5, 1992 with a pilot television film, which later aired as a multi-part serial during its regular run. The series aired on &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; block of syndicated animated series during the 1992/1993 broadcast season; concurrent with the &quot;Disney Afternoon&quot; shows, another 13 episodes aired on Saturday mornings on ABC in 1992. Reruns of the series later aired on The Disney Channel starting on September 3, 1996, and later on sister cable channel Toon Disney, with reruns airing on it until January 2005. The program returned from September 2006 until August 2008, with the Christmas special airing on Christmas in the United States.

&quot;Goof Troop&quot; was adapted into the feature film &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995), which received mixed reviews but was a box office success. The film was followed by a direct-to-video sequel, &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; (2000) and served as the finale to &quot;Goof Troop&quot;. The two films featured Bill Farmer, Rob Paulsen and Jim Cummings reprising their character roles from &quot;Goof Troop&quot; in these two films, with Jason Marsden providing the voice of an older Max. Dana Hill, who voiced Max in the series, commercials, promos, miscellaneous and other Disney projects, died on July 15, 1996, at the age of 32, after suffering a massive stroke related to her diabetes.

The series&#x27; premise was also incorporated into 1999&#x27;s &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot; and its 2004 sequel, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot;, the former depicting Max at a much younger age preceding &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, while the latter continues Max&#x27;s age progression to a young adult age.

==Characters==
===Main===
====Goof Family====
*G.G. “Goofy&quot; Goof (voiced by Bill Farmer) is Max Goof&#x27;s single father. In the pilot episode, he and Max move back to his hometown of Spoonerville from another city, where they lived in a motorhome, and end up living next door to the Petes. Goofy&#x27;s biggest flaws are his short attention span and scatter-brained nature, as well as his clumsiness, which often annoys Pete. However, Goofy is very calm and kind, and usually turns the other cheek when Pete insults him. Despite this, he can get angry and defensive toward Pete, but is forgiving and still considers Pete to be his best friend.
*Maximilian &quot;Max&quot; Goof (voiced by Dana Hill), is Goofy&#x27;s son and an only child. He is 11½ years old, and is in the same grade as his best friend P.J. at their junior high school. He likes skateboarding, video games, rock music, girls, and outwitting bullies. While he is generally friendly, he, like Pete, can be cunning and/or coercive when pushed or tricked. He loves his father and is close to him, but wishes he were more normal, as he is often embarrassed by his clumsy and doting behavior. According to an interview with Disney Adventures, voice actress Dana Hill used her normal speaking voice when portraying Max.
*Waffles (vocal effects by Frank Welker) is the Goofs&#x27; pet cat, who is often a victim of the hijinks that occur between them and the Petes. At times, Waffles is sneaky, mischievous, and selfish, often trying to get more food or pick fights with the Petes&#x27; dog, Chainsaw, whom he is antagonistic towards. However, he also displays a more laid-back attitude, wanting peace and quiet from the craziness of the Goofs&#x27; and Petes&#x27; lives.

====Pete Family====
*Peter P. Pete, Sr. (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a used-car salesman who lives with his wife, Peg, and their children, his son P.J. and daughter Pistol. He and his family live next door to Goofy, whom he has known since childhood. He is dishonest, mean, and cunning, often exploiting Goofy in his schemes to get rich quick or improve his own image. However, his schemes often backfire on him and he sometimes feels guilty about his behavior and works to make things right. He is both a protagonist and an anti-hero, as he dislikes Goofy but also tolerates and helps him.
*Peg Pete (voiced by April Winchell) is Pete&#x27;s wife and P.J. and Pistol&#x27;s mother, who works as a real estate agent in Spoonerville and has been married to him for at least twenty years. She is headstrong, quick-witted, and short-tempered when angry, and although she and Pete often clash over his schemes, she loves him dearly and their arguments serve to keep him in check.
*Peter Pete, Jr. (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is Pete and Peg&#x27;s eldest child, Pistol&#x27;s older brother, and Max&#x27;s best friend, who, in contrast to his father, is shy, but kind. He is in the same grade as Max and, like him, enjoys skateboarding, bike-riding, video games, and rock music, but also has a personal interest in poetry. Max often encourages him to take risks and follow along with his ideas to achieve their goals, and he is usually on the receiving end of his father&#x27;s schemes. He often plays the role of accomplice to those plotting to thwart his father, usually Peg or Max, but is capable of seeing through his father&#x27;s plans on his own.
*Pistol Pete (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) is Pete and Peg&#x27;s youngest child and P.J.&#x27;s younger sister, who is 4½–6 years old, and in kindergarten. She is girly in her love of tea parties, animals, and dolls, but also has a tomboy streak in her fascination with speed, sports, professional wrestling, and bugs; she is also talkative and often asks questions. She often gets into mischief, leading others to get in trouble trying to bail her out.
*Chainsaw (vocal effects by Frank Welker) is the Petes&#x27; pet dog, who hates Waffles and often chases and barks at him, but is also on the receiving end of his antics. On rare occasions, she and Waffles tolerate each other and get along.

*The Circus Ringmaster (voiced by Corey Burton) is the main antagonist of the episode &quot;Three Ring Bind&quot;, in which he and Giblet try to sell their circus animals to be made into food. He and Pistol become enemies after she visits the circus and takes the animals home with her.
*Douglas Twinkmeyer (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a student at Spoonerville Jr. High School, who was once the most respected kid in school as the chief of the safety patrol. However, after being exposed as being behind a plan to corner the market on the value of Lefty McGuffin cards, he is reassigned to patrol Pistol&#x27;s preschool.
*Tooth (voiced by S. Scott Bullock) and Nails (voiced by Candi Milo) were Douglas&#x27;s henchmen, who help him carry out his plan by taking other kids&#x27; money so they could buy the students&#x27; Lefty McGuffin baseball cards for Douglas to destroy, making his Lefty McGuffin card the only one in existence. After Max and P.J. stop them, they are sentenced to two weeks of clapping erasers in detention hall.
*Dutch Spackle (voiced by Charles Nelson Reilly in &quot;Unreal Estate&quot; &amp; Michael Bell in &quot;A Pizza the Action&quot;) is a handyman who Peg hires in &quot;Unreal Estate&quot; to help Pete repair their lake house so she can sell it, but Pete fires Dutch and replaces him with Goofy after spending most of Dutch&#x27;s work fee on a new fishing device. Dutch also appears in &quot;A Pizza the Action&quot;, where he is a truck driver sent to tow the Goofs&#x27; house after their pizza business failed, but ends up towing the Petes&#x27; house instead after a mix up.
*Bubbles (voiced by Jennifer Darling) is a dragon-like dinosaur that hatches from an egg that Max finds at Spoonerville&#x27;s lake. After she hatches, Max tries to hide Bubbles in his and Goofy&#x27;s basement, but Goofy soon finds out about Bubbles as she grows. When she gets too big, Max and P.J. try to hide her from Pete, but Pistol finds out about Bubbles and tells Pete about her, who pursues her after she eats his favorite chair. Eventually, Goofy reunites Bubbles with her mother and takes her back to the lake, where she and Max say goodbye to each other.

===Goof History cast===

===VHS releases===
On February 26, 1993, Disney released three VHS cassettes of the series in the United States, titled &quot;Banding Together&quot;, &quot;Goin&#x27; Fishin, and &quot;The Race is on!&quot;. They included the episodes &quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Goof&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters of the Weird Mime&quot;, &quot;Slightly Dinghy&quot;, &quot;Wrecks, Lies &amp; Videotape&quot;, &quot;Meanwhile, Back at the Ramp&quot;, and &quot;Tub Be or Not Tub Be&quot;. The videotapes included a &quot;Goof Troop&quot; music video which played at the end of each tape.
Additionally, on September 28, 1993, the &quot;Goof Troop&quot; episode &quot;Have Yourself a Goofy Little Christmas&quot; was released together with the &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Leaf&quot; on one VHS cassette as a special release called &quot;Happy Holidays with Darkwing Duck and Goofy!&quot; On October 5, 1993, the &quot;Goof Troop&quot; episode &quot;Hallow-Weenies&quot; was released together with the &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot; episode &quot;Ghost of a Chance&quot; on one VHS cassette as a special release called &quot;Boo-Busters&quot;. The episode &quot;FrankenGoof&quot; was released with the &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode &quot;Ducky Horror Picture Show&quot; on another special VHS release titled &quot;Monster Bash&quot;.

====Australia and New Zealand releases====
On November 26, 1993, three VHS cassettes containing 6 episodes of the series were released in Australia and New Zealand.
===DVD releases===
On February 14, 2006, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released &quot;Goof Troop&quot;: Volume 1 on DVD in Region 1. This one-disc release features three episodes, including &quot;Slightly Dinghy&quot;, &quot;Wrecks, Lies &amp; Videotape&quot;, and &quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Goof&quot;, with no bonus material. Many fans did not buy &quot;Goof Troop&quot; Volume 1 because it has only three episodes and additional episodes were only available on VHS. At the time, many fans were still waiting for Disney to put out &quot;Goof Troop&quot; Volume 1 again with more episodes. The DVD release of &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; features one episode titled &quot;Calling All Goofs&quot;, but the intro is removed. A Disney Movie Club exclusive DVD titled &quot;Have Yourself A Goofy Little Christmas&quot; contains the holiday special of the same name.

In 2013, Disney Movie Club released two new volumes of &quot;Goof Troop&quot; on DVD. Each volume released from the Disney Movie Club includes 27 episodes of the show for a total of 54 episodes released, leaving 25 unreleased episodes to go.

&quot;Goof Troop&quot; Volumes 1 and 2, in addition to &quot;Have Yourself a Goofy Little Christmas&quot;, had a wider retail DVD release in January 2015 and were Wal-Mart Exclusives in Canada ahead of that wider release date.

===Video on demand===
The entire series (barring the curious absence of the episode &quot;Counterfeit Goof&quot;) is currently available in HD for purchase on Amazon Prime Video, Google TV and the iTunes Store with the episodes being split into five volumes/seasons.

The series has been available to stream on Disney+ since its launch on November 12, 2019, with the exception of the stand-alone holiday special &quot;Have Yourself a Goofy Little Christmas&quot;. Though, the often-excluded episode &quot;Counterfeit Goof&quot; is included there.

It was also previously available on the DisneyLife streaming service in the UK, also including the episode &quot;Counterfeit Goof&quot; which is missing on other streaming platforms. DisneyLife has since been rebranded into Disney+, upon on the latter service&#x27;s launch in that region on March 24, 2020.

==Legacy==
&quot;Goof Troop&quot; has had a lasting impact on Goofy and Pete’s careers, as their later appearances throughout the 90s to the mid-2000s were built on the show&#x27;s status quo. These include &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot;, &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;, &quot;House of Mouse&quot; and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot;, all of which feature Goofy and Pete&#x27;s respective families as major characters. Goofy and Pete also appeared on &quot;Bonkers&quot; and &quot;Raw Toonage&quot; in their &quot;Goof Troop&quot; designs.

In the &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot series&#x27; premiere episode, Spoonerville is mentioned amongst a number of locations that Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s company, McDuck Enterprises, conducts business in. In the season three episode &quot;Quack Pack!&quot;, Goofy in his &quot;Goof Troop&quot; design appears as a guest character as part of a 1990s sitcom the Duck Family had become trapped in. Max and P.J. also make non-physical appearances via Goofy&#x27;s family pictures.

In 2023, new photos were added to the inside of Goofy&#x27;s house in the refurbished Mickey&#x27;s Toontown area of Disneyland. The photos now include pictures of Goofy and Max, a picture of Pete with his family, and a picture of Max with P.J. and Pistol. There is also now a height chart for Goofy and Max on a doorway frame in the house.

==Adaptations==
A video game very loosely based on the series was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on July 11, 1993.

Two films loosely based on &quot;Goof Troop&quot; were made years after the show&#x27;s end. The first film, &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, was released on April 7, 1995, which heavily exploits adolescent angst and crude humor that are not present in the show. The second film, &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;, was released on video on February 29, 2000, which serves as the series finale.

<text>Nikephoros I (; 750 – 26 July 811), also known as Nicephorus I, was Byzantine emperor from 802 to 811. He was General Logothete (finance minister) under Empress Irene, but later overthrew her to seize the throne for himself. Prior to becoming emperor, he was sometimes referred to as &quot;the Logothete&quot; () and &quot;Genikos&quot; or &quot;Genicus&quot; (), in recognition of his previous role as General Logothete.

During his reign, Nikephoros engaged in military campaigns against both the Arabs and the Bulgarians, although the outcomes were varied. While leading an invasion into Bulgaria, he suffered a defeat and was killed at the Battle of Pliska.

==Background==
According to several sources outside the Byzantine context, such as Michael the Syrian, al-Tabari, and Mas&#x27;udi, there is a tradition that suggests Nikephoros had Ghassanid Arab origins and that he descended from the final Ghassanid ruler Jabala ibn al-Ayham. Al-Tabari assets that he obtained this information from Byzantine sources, although no surviving Byzantine chronicle explicitly mentions the emperor&#x27;s ethnic background. Paul Julius Alexander, a modern scholar, proposes that al-Tabari might have indeed transmitted information found in Byzantine writings. He points to an apocalyptic text that has been preserved in a &quot;hopelessly corrupt&quot; copy, where it is mentioned that the emperor hailed &quot;from the race of Gopsin&quot;. The historian Nadia Maria El-Cheikh transmits another, alternative, tradition from Arab sources (specifically al-Masudi), in which Nikephoros supposedly originated from the Iyad tribe; she doubts both traditions, believing that they are simply legends. If he was of Arabian ancestry, one of his ancestors must have migrated to Pisidia in Asia Minor, where Nikephoros was born.
==Accession==
Nikephoros was appointed finance minister (&quot;logothetēs tou genikou&quot;) by Empress Irene. He played a significant role in a power struggle among courtiers. During Irene&#x27;s years as sole ruler (797–802), discontent grew due to her financial laxity. In 802, Charlemagne initiated marriage negotiations to &quot;unite&quot; the new Western and Eastern empires, thus resolving the problem of two emperors. Irene was happy to do so, but the proposal was frightening to some Byzantine civil and military officials, including Domestic of the Schools Niketas Triphyllios and relative of Irene Leon Sarantapechos, who began a conspiracy led by Nikephoros to overthrow Irene. While the Frankish ambassadors were still in Constantinople to negotiate the marriage, the conspiracy was set in motion. Irene was at her palace near the Harbour of Eleutherios. Nikephoros&#x27; co-conspirators falsely informed the guards that the courtier Aetios was forcing Irene to cede the throne to his brother Leo, and that opponents of the coup wished to make Nikephoros emperor instead. The guards sided with Nikephoros, and the palace was surrounded. The next day, Irene was removed and confined to the Great Palace of Constantinople. With the support of his co-conspirators, Nikephoros was then crowned emperor by Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople in the Hagia Sophia on 31 October 802. At first Irene was banished to the nearby island of Prinkipo, but she was suspected of plotting with Aetios, and so banished to Lesbos.
==Reign==
Nikephoros undertook a comprehensive reorganisation of the Byzantine Empire and made efforts to strengthen its borders. Similarly to the Isaurian emperors, Nikephoros enacted a vigorous policy of resettlement of impoverished soldiers and peasants from the themes of Asia Minor to Thrace, Greece and Macedonia. He expanded and consolidated the imperial military forces in various themes, managing the empire&#x27;s finances with strict discipline, which led to the displeasure and hostility of his subjects. To secure political stability and succession, he crowned his son Staurakios co-emperor on Christmas Day 803.

According to later accounts by &quot;Theophanes Continuatus&quot; in the 10th century and &quot;Synopsis Chronike&quot; in the 13th century, the rebellion of General Bardanes Tourkos in 803 may have been triggered by dissatisfaction with Nikephoros&#x27; handling of army salaries. Two influential supporters of Bardanes, Generals Leo (later Emperor Leo V) and Michael (later Emperor Michael II), defected to Nikephoros, receiving major promotions as a reward. Bardanes surrendered on the condition of a pledge of safety for him and his followers but he was soon blinded and sent to a monastery. A conspiracy led by the patrician Arsaber in 808 had a similar outcome.

In 805, the Sclaveni of Patras in the Peloponnese rebelled against Nikephoros, who in response appropriated them and their property to the Archbishopric of Patras.

Upon the death of Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople in February 806, Nikephoros appointed an iconodule layman, Nikephoros, causing the monks at the Monastery of Stoudios including Theodore the Stoudite and Plato of Sakkoudion to grow hostile towards him. Nikephoros also revived the Moechian controversy by convoking a synod in which Constantine VI&#x27;s second marriage was declared lawful. Theodore persuaded his brother, Joseph, the Archbishop of Thessalonica, to refuse to celebrate the Christmas liturgy with the Patriarch and Emperor, leading to a confrontation. Nikephoros confirmed in a 809 synod that the emperor was not bound by canon law, and demoted Joseph, Theodore and Plato, banishing them to the Princes&#x27; Islands. Although the Stoudites were unsuccessful, Theodore&#x27;s subsequent reputation benefited from his position and behaviour.

Nikephoros&#x27; imposition of taxes and his attempts to exert control over the church created a rift between him and the clergy. Although he appointed the iconodule Nikephoros as the patriarch, Emperor Nikephoros was portrayed unfavorably by ecclesiastical historians such as Theophanes the Confessor.

===Italy===
In 802, Charlemagne recognised the Republic of Venice as a Frankish fief under his third son, Pepin of Italy. Nikephoros responded by sending a fleet, but a compromise was reached in which the pro-Frankish Doge, Obelerio degli Antenori, would accept the additional title of &quot;spatharios&quot; to confirm his imperial loyalty. Nikephoros concluded a treaty known as the &quot;Pax Nicephori&quot; with Charlemagne, but refused to acknowledge his imperial status. Relations between the two deteriorated, leading to a war over Venice between 807 and 810 when Obelerio began to show signs of disloyalty, and a second Byzantine fleet arrived. While Nikephoros managed to suppress a rebellion in Venice in 807, he suffered significant losses to the Franks. The conflict was ultimately resolved after Nikephoros&#x27; death. Local opinion was overwhelmingly in favour of Byzantium, resulting in the assignment of Venice, Istria, the Dalmatian coast, and Southern Italy to the Eastern realm, while Rome, Ravenna, and the Pentapolis were included in the Western realm.

===Campaigns against the Arabs and Bulgars===

Shortly after Nikephoros&#x27; accession, he sent an insulting letter to Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid, demanding the return of tribute which Empress Irene had paid. He withheld further tribute, and there may have been raids against Arab settlements. Nikephoros thus committed himself to a war against Harun. Due to Bardanes&#x27; disloyalty, Nikephoros was forced to lead the military campaign himself, resulting in a severe defeat at the Battle of Krasos in Phrygia in 805. Although there was an exchange of prisoners, Harun imposed a tribute of 30,000 dinars on Byzantium. In 806, a Muslim army comprising 135,000 soldiers invaded the Empire, once again led by Harun, and captured Heraclea Cybistra and Tyana. Unable to match the Muslim forces, Nikephoros agreed to peace on the condition of an immediate payment of 50,000 &quot;nomismata&quot; and an annual tribute of 30,000 &quot;nomismata&quot;. Harun had taken measures to secure the Arab-Byzantine frontier including the construction of new fortified districts (&quot;al-Awasim&quot;) in order to more effectively gain control of Asia Minor. However, with the Caliphate embroiled in a succession struggle following Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s death in 809, Nikephoros was able to focus on dealing with Krum, the Khan of Bulgaria, who was posing a threat to the empire&#x27;s northern frontiers and had recently conquered Serdica (now Sofia).

Irene abolished several economic policies enacted by the Isaurians to sustain the Byzantine military, including the taxing of soldiers&#x27; widows to compensate for the loss of a fully-equipped soldier, if their household were to continue receiving a pension and tax exemptions. Thus, there was a manpower shortage by 809/810 which forced Nikephoros to decree that rural peasants be enlisted and equipped at the expense of their fellow villagers—a policy which drew harsh criticism from Theophanes the Confessor who numbered it among Nikephoros&#x27; &quot;vexations&quot;. In 809, the Bulgars captured the wagon of the &quot;rogai&quot; (cash renumeration for the Byzantine military) on the river Struma, which contained 79,200 &quot;nomismata&quot;. In 811, the Arabs captured the &quot;rogai&quot; of the Armeniac Theme which totalled to 93,600 &quot;nomismata&quot;. The payment of &quot;rogai&quot; was vital for the military and so the wagon was a key target for enemy capture.

In 811, Nikephoros launched an invasion of Bulgaria and was initially successful against Khan Krum and his armies, and sacked the Bulgarian capital, Pliska. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Michael the Syrian, a 12th-century patriarch of the Syrian Jacobites, describes the brutality and atrocities committed by Nikephoros: &quot;Now Nicephorus went with a large force against the Bulghars. He reached the capital city of their kingdom and caused great destruction, to the point that he threw their little children on the ground and mercilessly drove over them with his threshing wagons.&quot; As Nikephoros&#x27; forces were returning to Byzantium, the imperial army was ambushed and annihilated in the Varbitsa Pass at the Battle of Pliska by Krum. Nikephoros perished in the battle, and Krum is said to have had his head severed and used his skull as a drinking cup. The defeat was disastrous for Byzantine morale and for the political stability of the Empire.

==Assessment and legacy==
The reigns of the iconoclast emperors Leo III the Isaurian () and Constantine V () were militarily successful and saw the abatement of the Arab and Bulgar threat. According to the iconodule Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople, Isaurian propaganda ascribed both their military successes and longevity to their iconoclasm. The validity of iconoclasm was only confirmed by the military disasters under the iconodule emperors Nikephoros I and Michael I Rhangabe () as well as the success of the iconoclast Leo V the Armenian () against the Bulgars.

==Family==
By an unknown wife Nikephoros I had at least two children:
* Staurakios, who succeeded as emperor.
* Prokopia, who married Michael I Rhangabe, emperor 811–813.

<text>High School is a 1968 American documentary film by Frederick Wiseman that shows a typical day for students and faculty at a Pennsylvanian high school during the late 1960s. It is one of the first direct cinema (or cinéma vérité) documentaries . It was shot over five weeks between March and April 1968 at Northeast High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The film was not shown in Philadelphia at the time of its release, because of Wiseman&#x27;s concerns over what he called &quot;vague talk&quot; of a lawsuit.

The film was released in November 1968. &quot;High School&quot; has aired on PBS. Wiseman distributes his work (DVDs and 16mm prints) through Zipporah Films, which rents them to high schools, colleges, and libraries on a five-year long-term lease. &quot;High School&quot; was selected in 1991 for preservation in the National Film Registry.

In 1994, Wiseman released &quot;High School II&quot;, a second documentary on high school, based on Central Park East Secondary School in New York City.

==Reception and interpretation==
Film critic David Denby, writing in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, described &quot;High School&quot; as &quot;a savagely comic portrait&quot; of an urban high school in a period of emerging social unrest:

In his review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, A.A. Dowd wrote that &quot;High School&quot; “is filthy with the kind of revealing behavior that a documentarian can only hope and pray to capture on camera”, concluding:

<text>Demographic features of the population of the Czech Republic include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the population, economic status, and religious affiliations.

==Population==
With an estimated population of 10,516,707 as of 2022, compared to 9.3 million at the beginning of the 20th century, the population growth of the Czech Republic has been limited, due to low fertility rates and loss of population in and around World Wars I and II. Population loss during World War I was approximately 350,000. At the beginning of World War II the population of the Czech Republic reached its maximum (11.2 million). Due to the expulsion of the German residents after World War II, the Czech Republic lost about 3 million inhabitants and in 1947 the population was only 8.8 million. Population growth resumed, and in 1994 the population was 10.33 million.

From 1994 to 2003 natural growth was slightly negative (−0.15% per year) and the population decreased to 10.2 million. Since 2005, natural growth has been positive, but in recent times the most important influence on the population of the Czech Republic has been immigration: approximately 300,000 during the 2010s.

== Ethnic groups ==
The majority of the  million inhabitants of the Czech Republic are ethnically and linguistically Czech (95%). They are descendants of Slavic people from the Black Sea-Carpathian region who settled in Bohemia, Moravia and parts of present-day Austria in the 6th century AD. Other ethnic groups include Germans, Romani people, Poles, and Hungarians. Historical minorities like Germans and Poles are declining due to assimilation. There is also a growing community from Vietnam. Other ethnic communities like Greeks, Turks, Italians, and Yugoslavs are found in Prague. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, Slovaks living in the Czech Republic have comprised roughly 3% of the population.

There are different groups of national and ethnic minorities in the Czech Republic. The only &quot;old minority&quot; is Poles in the Trans-Olza region, while the &quot;new minorities&quot; are scattered among the majority population (generally in the larger towns). While some of the minorities have the whole social structure of Czech society (Poles, Slovaks, Greeks and Ukrainians), other represent only some of the social groups (i.e. Russian newcomers of middle class, and Romani people who generally represent the underclass).

===1880–1910===
===After World War I===

1 In 2011 a large part of the population did not claim any ethnicity, before the census it was widely mediatized that the question is not mandatory. The vast majority of those who did so are presumed to be ethnic Czechs, number of whom dropped by roughly the same amount that the number of undeclared people rose, circa 2.5 million.

The legal position of the minorities is defined foremost in the Act No. 273/2001 Coll. (The Rights of the Minorities Act) which implements the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms, Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and &quot;Recommendation of the Council of Europe No. 1201&quot;. There is a number of other enactments which to lesser extent deal with the minorities.

A special situation applies in the case of Moravians and Silesians, who are frequently allocated within the group of Czechs when it comes to the statistical data.

===Officially recognized minorities===
Minorities, which &quot;traditionally and on a long term basis live within the territory of the Czech Republic&quot; enjoy some privileges. As of 2022 there are 14 such officially recognized minorities, which are (alphabetically): Belarusians, Bulgarians, Croatians, Germans, Greeks, Hungarians, Poles, Romani people, Russians, Rusyns, Serbians, Slovaks, Ukrainians and Vietnamese.

Citizens belonging to the officially recognized minorities enjoy the right to &quot;use their language in communication with authorities and in courts of law&quot;. Article 25 of the Czech Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms provides the right of the national and ethnic minorities to education and communication with authorities in their own language. Act No. 500/2004 Coll. (&quot;The Administrative Rule&quot;) in its paragraph 16 (4) (&quot;Procedural Language&quot;) provides that a citizen of the Czech Republic who belongs to a national or an ethnic minority, which traditionally and on a long-term basis lives within the territory of the Czech Republic, has the right to address an administrative agency and proceed before it in the language of the minority. In the case that the administrative agency does not have an employee with knowledge of the language, the agency is bound to obtain a translator at the agency&#x27;s own expense. According to Act No. 273/2001 (&quot;About The Rights of Members of Minorities&quot;) paragraph 9 (&quot;The right to use language of a national minority in dealing with authorities and in the courts of law&quot;) the same also applies to members of national minorities in the courts of law.

Bulgarians

The economic migration of Bulgarians to the Czech Republic began in the 1990s. 4,363 citizens claimed to have Bulgarian nationality in the 2001 census. They mostly live in the large cities and towns, such as Prague, Brno, Ostrava, Karlovy Vary, Kladno, Ústí nad Labem, Děčín, and Havířov. Nowadays the newcomers from Bulgaria aim for these areas in particular, where they can join an already established community. Many of these economic immigrants have dual citizenship of both the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. However most of the recent immigrants still only have Bulgarian citizenship.

The Bulgarian Cultural Organisation publishes the magazine &quot;Roden Glas&quot;, while a folklore organisation &quot;Kytka&quot; promotes traditional Bulgarian dances. Among other organisations are &quot;Pirin&quot;, &quot;Zaedno&quot;, &quot;Vazraždane&quot; and &quot;Hyshove&quot;.

As an officially recognized minority the Bulgarian citizens of the Czech Republic enjoy the right to use their language in communication with authorities and in the courts of law. They also enjoy a number of other rights connected to the status of recognized minority, e.g. the right to education in their own language: the first Bulgarian school in the current Czech Republic was established in 1946 in Prague.

Germans

The German minority of the Czech Republic, historically the largest minority of the country, was almost entirely removed when 3 million were forcibly expelled in 1945–6 on the basis of the Potsdam agreement. The constitution guarantees rights for minority languages, however there are 13 municipalities with German minority constituting 10% of population, which qualifies for such provisions. There is no bilingual education system in Western and Northern Bohemia, where the German minority is mostly concentrated. However, this is in large part due to the absence of German-speaking youth, a heritage of the post-war policy of the Communist government.

According to the 2001 census there remain 13 municipalities and settlements in the Czech Republic with more than 10% Germans.

Many representatives of expellees&#x27; organizations support the erection of bilingual signs in all formerly German-speaking territory as a visible sign of the bilingual linguistic and cultural heritage of the region, but their efforts are not supported by some of the current inhabitants, as the vast majority of the current population is not of German descent.

The German-Czech Declaration of 21 January 1997 covered the two most critical issues—the role of some Sudeten Germans in the breakup of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and their expulsion after World War II.

Greeks
Another influential minority are Greeks. Large numbers of Greeks arrived in Czechoslovakia during the end of the Greek Civil War. The first transports of Greek children arrived in 1948 and 1949. Later, more transports, also including adults, arrived. They were partly leftists, communists and guerillas with their relatives, hence the willingness of Czechoslovak government to allow the immigration. This was viewed rather as a temporary solution. After the defeat of DSE and other left-wing guerillas, the Greeks stayed in Czechoslovakia. In total more than 12,000 Greeks immigrated to Czechoslovakia between 1948 and 1950. Today, there are about 7000 Greeks in the country (3219 according to 2001 census data), mostly in the 3 biggest towns – Prague, Brno, Ostrava – and also in Bohumín, Havířov, Jeseník, Karviná, Krnov, Šumperk, Třinec, Vrbno pod Pradědem and Žamberk (apart from the last one these towns are in Silesia).

Poles
The most concentrated linguistic minority in the Czech Republic are ethnic Poles, historically the plurality, today constituting about 10% of the population of Karviná and Frýdek-Místek districts. Poles have the right to use their language in official dealings; the public media (Czech TV and Czech Radio) regularly broadcast in Polish; and there are many Polish primary and secondary schools in the area. The Polish minority has been decreasing substantially since World War II as education in Polish was difficult to obtain, while Czech authorities did not permit bilingual signs to maintain Polish awareness among the population.

The erection of bilingual signs has technically been permitted since 2001, if a minority constitutes 10% of the population of a municipality. The requirement that a petition be signed by the members of minority was cancelled, thus simplifying the whole process. Still, only a couple of villages with large Polish minorities have bilingual signs (Vendryně/Wędrynia for instance).

Romanis
Another minority is the Roma, who nonetheless have very little influence on Czech policy. Around 90% of the Roma that lived in the Czech Republic prior to World War II were exterminated by the Nazi Porajmos. The Roma there now are 80% post-war immigrants from Slovakia or Hungary, or the descendants thereof. In total, the Roma in the CR now number around 200,000. There is Romani press in the CR, written in both Czech and Romani, but Romani radio is broadcast in Czech and there is no Romani television. Romani is also absent from legislative, judiciary, and other political texts but it has recently entered some university and elementary school courses. Life expectancy, literacy, median wage, school enrolment, and other socio-economic markers remain low while Roma compose the majority of prison and habitual offender populations despite accounting for only a fraction of a percent of Czech population.

==Immigration==
According to the Czech Statistical Office as of 31 December 2020 there were 632,570 legal foreign residents in the Czech Republic (5.1% of the total population). Residents from Ukraine are the largest group (165,356), followed by residents of Slovakia (124,544). There are also Asian immigrant communities in the Czech Republic. The largest is the Vietnamese one (62,842) followed by the Mongolians (10,135) and the Chinese (7,940). During the communist era the governments of Czechoslovakia and Vietnam had a deal concerning the education of Vietnamese people in Czechoslovakia. Vietnamese people came to Czechoslovakia for the first time in 1956 and then the number of new migrants grew until the fall of communism. First generation Vietnamese work mostly as small-scale businessmen in markets. Still, many Vietnamese are without Czech citizenship. One of the towns with the largest Vietnamese communities is Cheb. 
Other large immigrant groups come from Russia (41,692), Poland (20,733), Germany (20,861), Bulgaria (17,917) and Romania (18,396).

==Languages==

The Czech language (divided into three dialects in Bohemia, four dialects in Moravia, and two dialects in Czech Silesia) is the official language of the state. There is also the transitional Cieszyn Silesian dialect as well as the Polish language in Cieszyn Silesia, both spoken in Czech Silesia. Various Sudeten German dialects are currently practically extinct: present Czech Germans speak mainly Czech and/or Standard German. Czech Sign Language is the language of most of the deaf community.

For other languages spoken in the Czech Republic, see the above section on officially recognised minorities.

==Religion==


The 2021 census did not contain list of religious organisations and they had to be written by the respondent (unlike in the previous ones). Therefore another 231 thousand people responded with &quot;catholicism&quot; or similar response, 71 thousand people identified simply with &quot;Christianity&quot; and 27 thousand people claimed to be &quot;protestants&quot; or &quot;evangelicals&quot;. Moreover, after doubling their followers the Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia was the 2nd strongest church in 2021 census with 40,681 faithful.

Almost half (45.2%) of the Czech population prefer not to respond to religious questions in the Census. Others claim to have no religion or that they are without religious affiliation (34.2%). In comparison, one in every five claims to have some personal belief (20.6%).

The largest denominations are Roman Catholicism, estimated at 10.3% of the population, Protestant (0.5%), Hussites (0.4%). Other organized religions, including non-organized believers, totalled about (9.4%) (as of Census 2011).

According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2005, 19% of Czech citizens responded that &quot;they believe there is a God&quot;, whereas 50% answered that &quot;they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force&quot; and 30% that &quot;they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force&quot;; the percentage of believers is thus the lowest of EU countries after Estonia with 16%.

<text>Nikephoros II Phokas (, &quot;Nikēphóros Phōkãs&quot;; – 11 December 969), Latinized Nicephorus II Phocas, was Byzantine emperor from 963 to 969. His career, not uniformly successful in matters of statecraft or of war, nonetheless greatly contributed to the resurgence of the Byzantine Empire during the 10th century. In the east, Nikephoros completed the conquest of Cilicia and retook the islands of Crete and Cyprus, opening the path for subsequent Byzantine incursions reaching as far as Upper Mesopotamia and the Levant; these campaigns earned him the sobriquet &quot;pale death of the Saracens&quot;.

== Early life and career ==
Nikephoros Phokas was born around 912. From his paternal side, he belonged to the Phokas family which had produced several distinguished generals, including Nikephoros&#x27; father Bardas Phokas, brother Leo Phokas, and grandfather Nikephoros Phokas the Elder, who had all served as commanders of the field army (&quot;domestikos tōn scholōn&quot;). From his maternal side he belonged to the Maleinoi, a powerful Anatolian Greek family which had settled in Cappadocia. Early in his life Nikephoros had married Stephano. She had died before he rose to fame, and after her death he took an oath of chastity.

=== Early Eastern campaigns ===

Nikephoros joined the army at an early age. He was appointed the military governor of the Anatolic Theme in 945 under Emperor Constantine VII. In 954 or 955 Nikephoros was promoted to Domestic of the Schools, replacing his father, Bardas Phokas, who had suffered a series of defeats by the Hamdanids and by the Abbasids. The new position essentially placed Nikephoros in charge of the eastern Byzantine army. From 955, the Hamdanids in Aleppo entered a period of unbroken decline until their destruction in 1002. In June 957 Nikephoros managed to capture and destroy Adata. The Byzantines continued to push their advantage against the Arabs until the collapse of the Hamdanids, except for the period from 960 to 961, when the army turned its focus to the reconquest of Crete.

=== Conquest of Crete ===

From the ascension of Emperor Romanos II in 959, Nikephoros and his younger brother Leo Phokas were placed in charge of the eastern and western field armies respectively. In 960, 27,000 oarsmen and marines were assembled to man a fleet of 308 ships carrying 50,000 troops. At the recommendation of the influential minister Joseph Bringas, Nikephoros was entrusted to lead this expedition against the Muslim Emirate of Crete, and he led his fleet to the island and defeated a minor Arab force upon disembarking near Almyros. He soon began a nine-month siege of the fortress town of Chandax, where his forces suffered through the winter due to supply issues. Following a failed assault and many raids into the countryside, Nikephoros entered Chandax on 6 March 961 and soon wrested control of the entire island from the Muslims. Upon returning to Constantinople, he was denied the usual honor of a triumph, but was permitted an ovation in the Hippodrome.

===Later Eastern campaigns===

Following the conquest of Crete, Nikephoros returned to the east and marched a large and well-equipped army into Cilicia. In February 962, he captured Anazarbos and threatened the major city of Tarsus, which had recently ceased to recognize the Hamdanid Emir of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla. Nikephoros continued to ravage the Cilician countryside and won an open battle against ibn al-Zayyat, governor of Tarsus, who killed himself after the defeat. Thereafter, Nikephoros returned to the regional capital of Caesarea. Upon the beginning of the new campaigning season al-Dawla entered the Byzantine Empire to conduct raids, a strategy which left Aleppo dangerously undefended. Nikephoros soon took Syrian Hierapolis. In December, an army split between Nikephoros and John I Tzimiskes marched towards Aleppo, quickly routing an opposing force led by Naja al-Kasaki. Al-Dawla&#x27;s force caught up with the Byzantines, but he too was routed, and Nikephoros and Tzimiskes entered Aleppo on 24 December. The loss of the city would prove to be both a strategic and moral disaster for the Hamdanids. It was probably on these campaigns that Nikephoros earned the sobriquet &quot;The Pale Death of the Saracens&quot;.

== Ascension to the throne ==

On 15 March 963, Emperor Romanos II died unexpectedly at the age of twenty-six of uncertain cause. Both contemporary and later historians attribute the death to overindulgence in sex and drinking, or suspect that Romanos was poisoned by his wife, the Empress Theophano (c. 941–after 976). Theophano had already gained a reputation for intelligence and ambition, and hostile later historians characterize her as ruthless in achieving her goals. Romanos had already crowned as co-emperors his two sons Basil II and Constantine VIII. At the time that Romanos died, however, Basil was five years old and Constantine only three years old, so Theophano was named regent.
Theophano, however, was not allowed to rule alone. Joseph Bringas, the eunuch palace official who had become Romanos&#x27; chief councilor, maintained his position. According to contemporary sources he intended to keep authority in his own hands. He also tried to reduce the power of Nikephoros Phokas. The victorious general had been accepted as the actual commander of the army and maintained a strong connection to the aristocracy. Bringas was afraid that Nikephoros would attempt to claim the throne with the support of both the army and the aristocracy. This is exactly what he did. On July 2 in Caesarea, his armies, along with his highest-ranking officers, proclaimed Nikephoros emperor. From his position in Caesarea, and in advance of the news of his proclamation as emperor, Nikephoros sent a fleet to secure the Bosphorus Strait against his enemies. Around the same time, he appointed Tzimiskes as Domestic of the East, now taking on the formal roles of emperor. He then sent a letter to Constantinople requesting to be accepted as co-emperor. In response, Bringas locked down the city, forcing Nikephoros&#x27; father Bardas Phokas to seek sanctuary in the Hagia Sophia, while his brother Leo Phokas escaped the city in disguise. Bringas was able to garner some support within the city from a few high-ranking officers, namely Marianos Argyros, but he himself was not a skilled orator and was unable to obtain the support of other popular officials such as the Patriarch Polyeuctus and the general Basil Lekapenos. The people of Constantinople soon turned against his cause, killing Argyros in a riot and soon forcing Bringas to flee. On August 16, Nikephoros was proclaimed emperor and married the empress Theophano.

== Reign ==

=== Western Wars ===

Nikephoros II was not very successful in his western wars. Under his reign, relations with the Bulgarians worsened. It is likely that he bribed the Kievan Rus&#x27; to raid the Bulgarians in retaliation for them not blocking Magyar raids. This breach in relations triggered a decades-long decline in Byzantine-Bulgarian diplomacy and was a prelude to the wars fought between the Bulgarians and later Byzantine emperors, particularly Basil II.

Nikephoros&#x27; first military failures came in Sicily. In 962 the son of the governor of Fatimid Sicily, Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Kalbi, captured and reduced the Byzantine city of Taormina. The last major Byzantine stronghold in Sicily, Rometta, appealed to the newly crowned emperor Nikephoros for aid against the approaching Muslim armies. Nikephoros renounced his payments of tribute to the Fatimid caliphs, and sent a huge fleet, purportedly boasting a crew of around 40,000 men, under Patrikios Niketas and Manuel Phokas, to the island. The Byzantine forces, however, were swiftly routed in Rometta and at the Battle of the Straits, and Rometta soon fell to the Muslims, completing the Islamic conquest of Sicily.

In 967, the Byzantines and the Fatimids hastily concluded a peace treaty to cease hostilities in Sicily. Both empires had grander issues to attend to: the Fatimids were preparing to invade Egypt, and tensions were flaring up on mainland Italy between the Byzantines and the German emperor Otto I. The constant tension between the Germans and the Byzantines was largely due to mutual cultural biases, but also to the fact that both empires claimed to be the successors of the Roman Empire. Conflicts in southern Italy were preceded by religious contests between the two empires and by the malicious writings of Liutprand of Cremona. Otto first invaded Byzantine Apulia in 968 and failed to take Bari. Early the next year, he once again moved against Byzantine Apulia and Calabria, but, unable to capture Cassano or Bovino, failed to make any progress. In May he returned north, leaving Pandulf Ironhead to take charge of the siege. Pandulf was defeated and taken prisoner by the Byzantine general Eugenios, who went on to besiege Capua and enter Salerno. The two empires would continue to skirmish with each other until after the reign of Nikephoros, but neither side was able to make permanent or significant gains.

=== Eastern Wars ===

From 964 to 965, Nikephoros led an army of 40,000 men which conquered Cilicia and conducted raids in Upper Mesopotamia and Syria, while the patrician Niketas Chalkoutzes recovered Cyprus. In the spring of 964, Nikephorus headed east. During the summer he captured Anazarbos and Adana before withdrawing. Later that year, Nikephoros attempted to quickly take Mopsuestia, but failed, returning to Caesarea. It was around this time that Niketas Chalkoutzes instigated a coup in Cyprus, which at the time was a shared condominium between the Byzantines and the Arabs. In the summer of 965, the conquest of Cilicia began in earnest. Nikephorus and Tzimiskes seized Mopsuestia July 13, while Leo Phokas invested Tarsus and Nikephoros and Tzimiskes arrived soon after. Nikephoros won a pitched battle against the Tarsiots, routing their forces with his &quot;ironclad horsemen&quot;, referencing the Byzantine cataphracts. Within a fortnight, on August 16, Tarsus surrendered. Nikephoros allowed the inhabitants to depart unharmed before the city was plundered by his army. With the fall of these two strongholds, Cilicia was in the hands of the Byzantines.

In June 966, there was an exchange of prisoners between Sayf al-Dawla and the Byzantines, held at Samosata. In October 966, Nikephoros led an expedition to raid Amida, Dara and Nisibis, then he marched towards Hierapolis, where he took a relic with the image of Jesus to be later placed in the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos in Constantinople. He later sent a detachment to Barbalissos which returned with 300 prisoners, then he went to raid Wadi Butnan, Chalcis, Tizin and Artah, before laying siege to Antioch, but it was abandoned after eight days due to the lack of supplies.

In 967 or 968, Nikephoros annexed the Armenian state of Taron by diplomacy, in addition to Arzen and Martyropolis. In October 968, Nikephoros conducted another expedition which started by besieging Antioch for thirteen days, then he went south raiding and sacking most of the fortresses and cities along his path including Maarrat Misrin, Arra, Capharda, Larissa, Epiphania and Emesa in the Orontes valley until he reached the city of Tripoli, then he went to take Arca, Antarados, Maraclea, Gabala and received the submission of Laodicea. His aim was to cut off Antioch from its allies: the city was unsuccessfully blockaded two times in 966 and 968, and so the emperor decided to take it by hunger (so as not to damage to city) and left a detachment (a taxiarchy) of 1500 men in the fort of Pagrae, which lies on the road from Antioch to Alexandretta. The commander of the fort, the patrikios Michael Bourtzes, disobeyed the emperor&#x27;s orders and took Antioch with a surprise attack, supported by the troops of the stratopedarch Petros, eunuch of the Phokas family. Bourtzes was disgraced for his insubordination, and later joined the plot that killed Phokas.
=== Civil administration ===
Nikephoros&#x27; popularity was largely based on his conquests. Due to the resources he allocated to his army, Nikephoros was compelled to exercise a rigid economic policy in other departments. He retrenched court largess and curtailed the immunities of the clergy, and while he had an ascetic disposition, he forbade the foundation of new monasteries. By his heavy imposts and the debasement of the Byzantine currency, along with the enforcement and implementation of taxes across the centralized regions of the empire, he forfeited his popularity with the people and gave rise to riots.

Nikephoros also disagreed with the church on theological grounds. He wished the church to elevate those soldiers who died in battle against the Saracens to the positions of martyrs in the church – similar to the status of &quot;Shahid&quot; which the Emperor&#x27;s Muslim foes bestowed on their own fallen soldiers. In the Christian context, this was a highly controversial and unpopular demand.

In 967, he sparked a controversy in the capital by making a display of his military maneuvers in the Hippodrome similar in style to those displayed by the emperor Justinian centuries earlier preceding the Nika riots and its violent suppression within the stadium itself. The crowd within the Hippodrome panicked and began a stampede to retreat from the stadium, resulting in numerous deaths. In order to repopulate the regained lands in the East, he invited the Syriac Orthodox patriarch John VII Sarigta and his community to live in these lands. The Syriac community subsequently experienced a golden age with many monasteries founded, especially in the region around Melitene, such as the Monastery of Bārid, where John VII Sarigta and his successors came to reside.

Nikephoros was the author of extant treatises on military tactics, most famously the &quot;Praecepta Militaria&quot;, which contains valuable information on the art of war in his time, and the less-known &quot;On Skirmishing&quot; (), which concerned guerrilla-like tactics for defense against a superior enemy invasion force along the eastern frontier; though it purports that the tactics were no longer needed since the danger of the Muslim states to the east had subsided. It is likely that this latter work, at least, was not composed by the Emperor but rather for him; translator and editor George T. Dennis suggests that it was perhaps written by his brother Leo Phokas, then Domestic of the West. Nikephoros was a very devout man, and he helped his friend, the monk Athanasios, found the monastery of Great Lavra on Mount Athos.

=== Assassination ===
The plot to assassinate Nikephoros began when he dismissed Michael Bourtzes from his position following his disobedience in the siege of Antioch. Bourtzes was disgraced, and he would soon find an ally with whom to plot against Nikephoros. Towards the end of 965, Nikephoros had John Tzimiskes exiled to eastern Asia Minor for suspected disloyalty, but was recalled on the pleading of Nikephoros&#x27; wife, Theophano. According to Joannes Zonaras and John Skylitzes, Nikephoros had a loveless relationship with Theophano. He was leading an ascetic life, whereas she was secretly having an affair with Tzimiskes. Theophano and Tzimiskes plotted to overthrow the emperor. On the night of the deed, she left Nikephoros&#x27; bedchamber door unlocked, and he was assassinated in his apartment by Tzimiskes and his entourage on 11 December 969. He died praying to the mother of God. Following his death, the Phokas family broke into insurrection under Nikephoros&#x27; nephew Bardas Phokas, but their revolt was promptly subdued as Tzimiskes ascended the throne.

=== Contemporary descriptions ===

The tension between East and West resulting from the policies pursued by Nikephoros may be glimpsed in the unflattering description of him and his court by Bishop Liutprand of Cremona in his &quot;Relatio de legatione Constantinopolitana&quot;. His description of Nikephoros was clouded by the ill-treatment he received while on a diplomatic mission to Constantinople. Nikephoros, a man of war, was not apt at diplomacy. To add insult to injury, Pope John XIII sent a letter to Nikephoros while Liutprand was in Constantinople calling Otto I Emperor of Rome and even more insultingly referring to Nikephoros merely as Emperor of the Greeks. Liutprand failed in his goal of procuring an Imperial princess as a wife for Otto&#x27;s young son, the future emperor Otto II.

Bishop Liutprand described Nikephoros as:

:...a monstrosity of a man, a pygmy, fat-headed and like a mole as to the smallness of his eyes; disgusting with his short, broad, thick, and half hoary beard; disgraced by a neck an inch long; very bristly through the length and thickness of his hair; in color an Ethiopian; one whom it would not be pleasant to meet in the middle of the night; with extensive belly, lean of loin, very long of hip considering his short stature, small of shank, proportionate as to his heels and feet; clad in a garment costly but too old, and foul-smelling and faded through age; shod with Sicyonian shoes; bold of tongue, a fox by nature, in perjury, and lying a Ulysses.

Whereas Bishop Liutprand describes the emperor&#x27;s hair as being bristly, Leo the Deacon says it was black with &quot;tight curls&quot; and &quot;unusually long&quot;.

John Julius Norwich says, about his murder and burial, &quot;It was a honourable place; but Nikephoros Phocas, the White Death of the Saracens, hero of Syria and Crete, saintly and hideous, magnificent and insufferable, had deserved a better end&quot;.

=== Descendants ===
During the last decades of the tenth century, the Phokades repeatedly tried to get their hands again on the throne, and almost succeeded when Nikephoros&#x27; nephew, Bardas Phokas the Younger, rebelled against the rule of Basil II. His death, possibly by cardiac arrest, put an end to the rebellion, and ultimately to the political prominence of the Phokades, although Bardas the Younger&#x27;s own son, Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos, launched another abortive revolt in 1022 along with Nikephoros Xiphias.

===&quot;Praecepta Militaria&quot;===

Phokas was the author of a military manual, the &quot;Praecepta Militaria&quot;.

=== Modern honours ===
On 19 November 2004, the Hellenic Navy named its tenth in his honour as &quot;Nikiforos Fokas&quot; F-466 (formerly HNLMS &quot;Bloys Van Treslong&quot; F-824). Also, in the Rethymno regional unit in Crete, a municipality (Nikiforos Fokas) is named after him, as are many streets throughout Greece.

=== In popular culture ===
Nikephoros II appears as a character in:

<text>Technology assessment (TA, , ) is a practical process of determining the value of a new or emerging technology in and of itself or against existing technologies. This is a means of assessing and rating the new technology from the time when it was first developed to the time when it is potentially accepted by the public and authorities for further use. In essence, TA could be defined as &quot;a form of policy research that examines short- and long term consequences (for example, societal, economic, ethical, legal) of the application of technology.&quot;

== General description ==

TA is the study and evaluation of new technologies. It is a way of trying to forecast and prepare for the upcoming technological advancements and their repercussions to the society, and then make decisions based on the judgments. It is based on the conviction that new developments within, and discoveries by, the scientific community are relevant for the world at large rather than just for the scientific experts themselves, and that technological progress can never be free of ethical implications. Technology assessment was initially practiced in the 1960s in the United States where it would focus on analyzing the significance of &quot;supersonic transportation, pollution of the environment and ethics of genetic screening.&quot;

Also, technology assessment recognizes the fact that scientists normally are not trained ethicists themselves and accordingly ought to be very careful when passing ethical judgement on their own, or their colleagues, new findings, projects, or work in progress. TA is a very broad phenomenon which also includes aspects such as &quot;diffusion of technology (and technology transfer), factors leading to rapid acceptance of new technology, and the role of technology and society.&quot;

Technology assessment assumes a global perspective and is future-oriented, not anti-technological. TA considers its task as an interdisciplinary approach to solving already existing problems and preventing potential damage caused by the uncritical application and the commercialization of new technologies.

Therefore, any results of technology assessment studies must be published, and particular consideration must be given to communication with political decision-makers.

An important problem concerning technology assessment is the so-called Collingridge dilemma: on the one hand, impacts of new technologies cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used; on the other hand, control or change of a technology is difficult as soon as it is widely used. It emphasizes on the fact that technologies, in their early stage, are unpredictable with regards to their implications and rather tough to regulate or control once it has been widely accepted by the society. Shaping or directing this technology is the desired direction becomes difficult for the authorities at this period of time. There have been several approaches put in place in order to tackle this dilemma, one of the common ones being &quot;anticipation.&quot; In this approach, authorities and assessors &quot;anticipate ethical impacts of a technology (&quot;technomoral scenarios&quot;), being too speculative to be reliable, or on ethically regulating technological developments (&quot;sociotechnical experiments&quot;), discarding anticipation of the future implications.&quot;
Technology assessments, which are a form of cost–benefit analysis, are a medium for decision makers to evaluate and analyze solutions with regards to the particular technology assessment, and choose a best possible option which is cost effective and obeys the authoritative and budgetary requirements. However, they are difficult if not impossible to carry out in an objective manner since subjective decisions and value judgments have to be made regarding a number of complex issues such as (a) the boundaries of the analysis (i.e., what costs are internalized and externalized), (b) the selection of appropriate indicators of potential positive and negative consequences of the new technology, (c) the monetization of non-market values, and (d) a wide range of ethical perspectives. Consequently, most technology assessments are neither objective nor value-neutral exercises but instead are greatly influenced and biased by the values of the most powerful stakeholders, which are in many cases the developers and proponents (i.e., corporations and governments) of new technologies under consideration. In the most extreme view, as expressed by Ian Barbour in &#x27;’Technology, Environment, and Human Values&#x27;’, technology assessment is &quot;a one-sided apology for contemporary technology by people with a stake in its continuation.&quot;

Overall, technology assessment is a very broad field which reaches beyond just technology and industrial phenomenons. It handles the assessment of effects, consequences, and risks of a technology, but also is a forecasting function looking into the projection of opportunities and skill development as an input into strategic planning.&quot; Some of the major fields of TA are: information technology, hydrogen technologies, nuclear technology, molecular nanotechnology, pharmacology, organ transplants, gene technology, artificial intelligence, the Internet and many more. 

===Forms and concepts of technology assessment===
The following types of concepts of TA are those that are most visible and practiced. There are, however, a number of further TA forms that are only proposed as concepts in the literature or are the label used by a particular TA institution.
*Parliamentary TA (PTA): TA activities of various kinds whose addressee is a parliament. PTA may be performed directly by members of those parliaments (e.g. in France and Finland) or on their behalf of related TA institutions (such as in the UK, in Germany and Denmark) or by organisations not directly linked to a Parliament (such as in the Netherlands and Switzerland).
*Expert TA (often also referred to as the classical TA or traditional TA concept): TA activities carried out by (a team of) TA and technical experts. Input from stakeholders and other actors is included only via written statements, documents and interviews, but not as in participatory TA.
*Participatory TA (pTA): TA activities which actively, systematically and methodologically involve various kinds of social actors as assessors and discussants, such as different kinds of civil society organisations, representatives of the state systems, but characteristically also individual stakeholders and citizens (lay persons), technical scientists and technical experts. Standard pTA methods include consensus conferences, focus groups, scenario workshops etc. Sometimes pTA is further divided into expert-stakeholder pTA and public pTA (including lay persons). The participatory assessment makes room for the inclusion of laypeople and establishes the value of varied point of views, interests and knowledge. It shows importance of the need for decision makers and actors to have a varied set of mindsets and perspective to make a combined, informed and rational decision.
*Constructive TA (CTA): This concept of TA, developed in the Netherlands, but also applied and discussed elsewhere attempts to broaden the design of new technology through feedback of TA activities into the actual construction of technology. Contrary to other forms of TA, CTA is not directed toward influencing regulatory practices by assessing the impacts of technology. Instead, CTA wants to address social issues around technology by influencing design practices. It aims to &quot;mobilize insights on co-evolutionary dynamics of science, technology and society for anticipating and assessing technologies, rather than being predominantly concerned with assessing societal impacts of a quasi-given technology.&quot; This assessment established the value of involving users in the development and innovation process, encouraging the development and adaptation of new technology in their daily life. 
*Discursive TA or Argumentative TA: This type of TA wants to deepen the political and normative debate about science, technology and society. It is inspired by ethics, policy discourse analysis and the sociology of expectations in science and technology. This mode of TA aims to clarify and bring under public and political scrutiny the normative assumptions and visions that drive the actors who are socially shaping science and technology. This assessment can be used as a tool to analyse and evaluate the background of each and every reaction or perception that takes place for each technology; often some of the reactions these assessors receive are not related to science or technology. Some of the ways of analyzing actors and their reaction is by &quot;studying prospective users&#x27; everyday-life practices in their own right, and in naturalistic settings.&quot; Accordingly, argumentative TA not only addresses the side effects of technological change, but deals with both broader impacts of science and technology and the fundamental normative question of why developing a certain technology is legitimate and desirable.

<doc id="74009" wikidata="Q41689" url="?curid=74009" title="Nikephoros III Botaneiates">
<text>Nikephoros III Botaneiates (, 1002–1081), Latinized as Nicephorus III Botaniates, was Byzantine Emperor from 7 January 1078 to 1 April 1081. He became a general during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, serving with distinction during the Pecheneg revolt of 1048–1053. In 1057 he aided Isaac I Komnenos in overthrowing Emperor Michael VI Bringas, leading forces at the decisive Battle of Petroe. Under the Emperor Constantine X Doukas Nikephoros was made &quot;doux&quot;, first of Thessalonica and subsequently of Antioch. In the latter position he repelled numerous incursions from the Emirate of Aleppo. Constantine X died in 1067 and Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa married Romanos IV Diogenes; Nikephoros, who had also been a candidate for Eudokia&#x27;s hand and the position of emperor, was exiled and remained in retirement until Emperor Michael VII summoned him to serve as &quot;kouropalates&quot; and governor of the Anatolic Theme.

Having insulted Emperor Michael with overly frank appeals for help against the Seljuk Turks in Byzantine Anatolia, Nikephoros decided to protect himself from reprisals by seizing the throne. His military acumen and family renown won him strong support, and he took power in 1078 with the approval of the Byzantine Senate and the citizens of Constantinople. As emperor he faced numerous revolts, including those of Nikephoros Bryennios, Nikephoros Basilakes, and Constantine Doukas, as well as an attempted assassination by the Varangian Guard. Nikephoros performed many acts to increase his legitimacy and support, spending large amounts on donatives for the army and his supporters, forgiving all debt in arrears, and instituting minor legal reforms. Diplomatically, he secured the submission of Theodore Gabras and Philaretos Brachamios, governors of Trebizond and Antioch, respectively, who had become de facto independent of the Byzantine Empire.

In 1081, Alexios I Komnenos, sent to counter a Norman invasion, instead conspired to make himself emperor. He captured Constantinople on 1 April and arrested Nikephoros, who abdicated and became a monk in the Monastery of Peribleptus.

==Historiography and sources==
The most comprehensive account of Nikephoros III&#x27;s life and reign is &quot;The History&quot;, written in the 1070s by the Byzantine historian Michael Attaleiates and dedicated to Nikephoros himself. Attaleiates is the primary contemporary source for Nikephoros&#x27;s reign and counters the narrative of Byzantine historian Michael Psellos&#x27;s &quot;Chronographia&quot;, the only other contemporary source. Attaleiates highlights Nikephoros″s achievements, often recording actions which no other source mentions, such as his eleven-day rearguard command after the Battle of Zygos Pass, to which Attaleiates dedicates several pages. Attaleiates″s high opinion of Nikephoros was likely shaped by Nikephoros raising him to the rank of &quot;vestes&quot;, and by his benefiting from Nikephoros″s patronage. Much of Attaleiates″s work is shaped by his personal opinion of contemporary events, such as his bias against Nikephoros″s predecessor, Emperor Michael VII Doukas.

The Battle of Manzikert in 1071 is mentioned only in a single paragraph by Psellos, who chiefly comments that Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes should have studied strategy better; however, Attaleiates devotes an entire chapter to the details of the decisive battle, including the events before and after the battle, while also giving his own commentary and anecdotes of the actions and mistakes which were made. Attaleiates is invaluable in providing an understanding of what the populace of the Byzantine Empire, outside of the nobles of Constantinople, thought of the Turkish invasion of Anatolia. These opinions explain why Attaleiates condemns Michael VII and praises Nikephoros to such a degree: in the view of the average Byzantine, Michael was primarily at fault for the loss of Byzantine Anatolia, Attaleiates″s homeland, whereas Nikephoros, a fellow Anatolian, actively worked to prevent the further collapse of the Byzantine Empire.

Psellos&#x27;s &quot;Chronographia&quot; is largely useless in understanding the life of Nikephoros; while he provides a contemporary source from the view of the Byzantine nobles, he is far from objective in his review of events, although his retelling of Michael&#x27;s letter to Nikephoros is useful as it shares both Michael&#x27;s and Psellos″s opinion of the events. While Attaleiates generally provides a favorable account of Nikephoros, he does mention some of his failings, such as his defeat by the Oghuz Turks in 1063, whereas Psellos intentionally fails to mention several failings of Michael VII in his panegyrical chapter on him, including his loss of Anatolia to the Seljuk Turks and the debasement of currency which took place under him. The other main source for Nikephoros″s reign is Anna Komnene&#x27;s &quot;Alexiad&quot;, although she was born after the events, and the first sections of her account are generally derived from the writings of her husband Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger. She is also biased as a result of being the daughter of Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, who seized the throne from Nikephoros, causing the account to be from the view of Alexios&#x27;s rise. While her narrative primarily focuses on the actions of Alexios, it does provide information on Nikephoros″s last years in power and his subsequent exile to a monastery.

Nikephoros is briefly mentioned by John Skylitzes in his &quot;Synopsis of Histories&quot;, which covers the events of 811–1057, but is referenced far more in Skylitzes″s &quot;Continuatus&quot;. Although Skylitzes is a contemporary source, his &quot;Continuatus&quot; was written under Alexios, whom he is known to have favored; however, he generally follows the more objective account of Attaleiates, who was one of his main sources. Nikephoros Bryennius the Younger″s &quot;Material for a History&quot; chiefly relies on the testimonies of his contemporaries, including his father, Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder, and Alexios himself; however, it also relies on the works of Attaleiates, Psellos, and Skylitzes. Nikephoros Bryennios″s bias in favor of Alexios and against Nikephoros III is an inevitable result of being married to Alexios″s daughter, and of the fact that his father was blinded by Nikephoros. These authors mostly cover the career of Nikephoros from his role in the Battle of the Zygos Pass in 1053 to his death.

William of Apulia, a Norman historian who wrote in the 1090s, mentions Nikephoros during his account of Robert Guiscard&#x27;s invasion of the Byzantine Empire in 1081; as a foreigner, he was removed from the court politics of the Byzantine Empire, and thus provides a fair and objective view of Nikephoros. Nikephoros is also mentioned in the accounts of both Matthew of Edessa and Michael the Syrian, who wrote their chronicles several centuries after the events and are therefore quite objective in their treatment of Nikephoros, lacking political intrigue related to him. Michael is quite brief in his account of Nikephoros, but gives a balanced view – while he portrays Michael VII as incompetent and corrupt, he does praise Nikephoros as Attaleiates does. Michael&#x27;s usefulness is limited by his brevity on the subject, although it is likely, based on the contents of his chronicle, that Attaleiates himself served as a source. Matthew&#x27;s chronicle is longer, but clearly derived from the work of Psellos, as Matthew openly praises Michael VII while ridiculing Nikephoros, who he portrays as a hedonistic womanizer; ironically the exact accusation which Michael the Syrian makes against Michael VII.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===
Nikephoros was born in 1002 to Michael Botaneiates and his wife, members of the Botaneiates family, a prominent military family from the Anatolic Theme. According to Attaleiates, Nikephoros″s grandfather Nikephoros and father Michael both served as commanders under Basil II () during his campaigns against the Georgians and his conquest of Bulgaria; Attaleiates is the only source which gives this information. Attaleiates also states that the Botaniati family was related to Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas and the Phocas family. This was almost certainly used by Nikephoros to add legitimacy to his later rule, and this is corroborated by Psellos, who calls Nikephoros III &quot;Phocas&quot; in his reproduction of Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas&#x27; letter to him. Christian Settipani speculates that Nikephoros III&#x27;s great-grandfather Michael married an unnamed daughter of Nikephoros II. At an unknown date, Nikephoros married a woman named Vevdene, but he later married Maria of Alania, the former wife of Michael VII. He seems to have had at least one child with Vevdene, as Anna Komnene mentions his grandson in the &quot;Alexiad&quot;. Little else is known of Nikephoros″s life before 1053, other than that he served as a commander under Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos during the Pecheneg revolt of 1048–1053. His sister Botaneiatissa married Theodulos Synadenos and had a daughter Synadene, who became the second wife of Géza I of Hungary.

===Early career===
Nikephoros first attracts the attention of his Byzantine contemporaries and historians for his actions after the Battle of Zygos Pass in 1053. Attaleiates records that Nikephoros was able to wield effective command over his retreating mounted troops, preventing them from being overrun by Pecheneg forces during the Pecheneg revolt. Nikephoros ordered his cavalry to hold a tight formation, limiting the damage the horse-archers of the Pechenegs could inflict and deployed scouts to prevent his troops from being ambushed. During his maneuvering, the Pechenegs attempted to assault his troops and break their formation several times, but each time they were rebuffed. Nikephoros led his troops for eleven days in spite of constant harassment. According to Attaleiates, the Pechenegs attempted to convince the Byzantines to surrender and killed their horses with their bows when this failed. Nikephoros had them continue on foot and refused to flee when offered a horse, proclaiming he would prefer death to the dishonor of cowardice, which reinforced the morale of his troops. After eleven days of constant attacks, they reached the Byzantine city of Adrianople, where the Pechenegs finally gave up their pursuit. For his actions, Emperor Constantine IX awarded Nikephoros the high court rank of &quot;magistros&quot;. While it is possible that his actions were exaggerated by Attaleiates, it fits comfortably with his reputation as a strong commander.

Nikephoros is next mentioned for his role in the revolt of Isaac I Komnenos against the Byzantine Emperor Michael VI Bringas () in 1057. This revolt was a result of Michael&#x27;s favoritism toward the civil officials of Constantinople, and his scorn toward the military elites. After the &quot;Dynatoi&quot; were humiliated by Michael by his refusal to grant them any gifts, Isaac attempted to reconcile with Michael, only to be personally insulted by him, sparking a civil war, which is mentioned by Skylitzes, Psellos, and Attaleiates; Psellos himself led the embassy from Michael to Isaac. Isaac then gathered the support of other military elites before marching for Constantinople. At Constantinople, the Battle of Petroe took place on 20 August 1057, a decisive victory for Isaac, and reportedly one of the bloodiest battles the Byzantines engaged in during a civil war. Isaac&#x27;s victory placed the military aristocracy firmly back in control and marked the first time a general had held the throne since the death of Emperor Basil II in 1025. Nikephoros led a wing of Isaac&#x27;s forces during the battle, suggesting he had been a part of Isaac&#x27;s inner circle; Skylitzes mentions that during this battle Nikephoros fought a duel against one of Michael&#x27;s mercenaries, Randolf the Frank. In 1059, Isaac placed Nikephoros in command of the Danube frontier, where he remained until 1064. During his time at this command, he saved the life of the future Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes during Isaac&#x27;s campaign against the Hungarians.

By October 1061 at the latest, Nikephoros was serving as &quot;doux&quot; of Thessalonica. The evidence for his time in Thessalonica comes from several surviving signed and dated documents from the Iveron Monastery on Mount Athos. The first of these is an &quot;engraphon&quot; dated to December 1061. It mentions that Iveron&#x27;s abbot and two of its monks had delivered an order from Constantine X Doukas () to Nikephoros, &quot;doux&quot; of Thessalonica, in October (so Nikephoros″s tenure must have begun by then). The next two documents are a &quot;praktikon&quot; and a &quot;hypomnema&quot; both dated to August 1062. The &quot;praktikon&quot; still has a seal of Nikephoros″s attached to it, and all three documents also have Nikephoros″s signature. He misspelled his own name on all three. A fourth Athonite document, dated to February 1063, is signed by a &quot;doux&quot; of Thessalonica named Theodoros Dalassenos, so Nikephoros″s time as &quot;doux&quot; of Thessalonica must have ended by then.

The Iveron documents record some of Nikephoros″s activity settling complaints in the theme of Thessalonica. The first complaint we know of was a dispute centered on the Byzantine government&#x27;s confiscation of some of the property and &quot;Paroikoi&quot; (serfs) of the Iveron Monastery of Mount Athos, which the monastery viewed as unlawful. Nikephoros sent Michael the &quot;spatharokandidatos&quot; to inquire into the case, before ruling that, based upon a chrysobull issued by Basil II which had declared that the monastery&#x27;s property and &quot;Paroikoi&quot; were exempt from taxes, they could not be confiscated by the government. Nikephoros settled another dispute in February 1062, this time between the Monastery of Lavra and Theodoros of Aichmalotou, a local landowner, over monastic property; Nikephoros ruled in favor of the monastery. Nikephoros settled a boundary dispute between the Iveron Monastery and the Bishop of Ezoba, basing his ruling on the knowledge of the local populace. The last Thessalonian dispute we know of that Nikephoros ruled on was between the Iveron Monastery and the &quot;metochion&quot; of Melissourgeion; the &quot;metochion&quot; appears to have ignored a ruling previously made by Empress Theodora Porphyrogenita, which Nikephoros reasserted.

In the fall of 1064, the Oghuz Turks invaded the Byzantine Balkans and defeated both Nikephoros and Basil Apokapes, &quot;archon&quot; of Paristrion, in battle, and took them captive, which Attaleiates suggests was greatly humiliating for Nikephoros; however, the two men were able to escape captivity after the Oghuz Turk forces were devastated by both Bulgarian raids and disease. The surviving Oghuz Turks were quickly recruited into the Byzantine army.

Nikephoros may have also served as &quot;doux&quot; of Cyprus sometime in the mid-1060s. The only source for this is Bar Hebraeus, who wrote that Nikephoros &quot;ruled first over the island of Cyprus, and then over Antioch&quot;. Olga Karagiorgou suggests a date of 1065-67 for this stage in Nikephoros″s career.

===Later military career===

Nikephoros was reassigned as &quot;doux&quot; of Antioch in 1065 by Constantine X due to the mismanagement of the province by its previous &quot;doux&quot;, Nikephoritzes, who would later serve as &quot;logothetes&quot; under Michael VII. Although his troops were inexperienced and under-equipped, Nikephoros was able to repel numerous raids against Antioch from the Emirate of Aleppo, largely due to his own military prowess, his well-trained retinue, and his use of local levies. Nikephoros was relieved of his command in 1067, likely due to the political efforts of the civil officials, who wished to eliminate the military aristocracy, of which Nikephoros was a member. The political machinations of the civil officials, and their willingness to undermine the military elites, had built up under previous emperors such as Romanos III () and Michael VI; during this period the civil officials had become increasingly powerful, until Isaac I&#x27;s reforms definitively curbed their power. Constantine X had become emperor when Isaac abdicated in 1059 and was considerably weaker than Isaac had been, allowing the civil officials to manipulate him, thereby preventing him from gaining the level of control that Isaac had. This was largely accomplished by undermining the military aristocracy, even while the Turks had begun to invade Byzantine Armenia.

Upon the death of Constantine X in 1067, his wife, Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa, considered taking Nikephoros as husband and emperor, but instead chose Romanos IV Diogenes (). The need for an emperor was made pressing by the constant raids of the Turks into the Byzantine territories of Antioch, Cilicia, and Armenia; Eudokia, Patriarch John VIII of Constantinople, and the Byzantine Senate agreed that their top priority was the defense of the empire and that they needed an emperor to lead troops to repel the Turks. Nikephoros was the favorite candidate of the senate, but was in the field leading troops in Antioch, and was still married to Vevdene. Romanos was already in Constantinople and had no wife, making him a much more suitable candidate; Matthew of Edessa also suggests that Eudokia already desired Romanos over Nikephoros. Upon taking power, Romanos exiled Nikephoros to his holdings in the Anatolic Theme and excluded him from the Manzikert campaign due to questionable loyalty, likely because he had been Eudokia&#x27;s other candidate for the throne, and thus posed a threat to Romanos″s rule. After Romanos was captured by the Seljuks at the disastrous Battle of Manzikert, Nikephoros did not involve himself in the coup d&#x27;état of Michael VII against the still-captive Romanos, and would not again lead troops until the uprising of the mercenary leader Roussel de Bailleul.
Emperor Michael VII () brought Nikephoros, who was now in his early seventies, out of retirement and declared him &quot;kouropalates&quot; and governor of the Anatolic Theme. The title of &quot;kouropalates&quot; was reserved for esteemed members of the imperial court who were not related to the ruling dynasty, and officially designated him as a high-ranking general; the title of &quot;kouropalates&quot; was below the rank of &quot;nobilissimus&quot; and two ranks below the title of &quot;Caesar&quot;. None of the sources specifically mention why Nikephoros was recalled to lead forces, but it is likely due to a few reasons: Nikephoros was a renowned commander who had served under the Doukas emperors, he did not have any loyalty to Romanos IV, and the main theater of war was in the eastern portion of the Byzantine Empire, the terrain of which Nikephoros knew well; he likely gained the military governorship of the Anatolic Theme because it was his homeland. Michael VII then sent Nikephoros and the Caesar John Doukas to defeat the rebellion of Roussel de Bailleul. Nikephoros warned John not to cross the Zompos Bridge and engage the forces of Roussel, but John disregarded him and led his troops to defeat at the Battle of the Zompos Bridge in 1074. Nikephoros, who commanded the rearguard, held his troops back from fighting in the battle; modern historians have debated exactly why he chose to withhold his troops, and whether they could have turned the tide of the battle. After the defeat of the forces under John, Nikephoros gathered the survivors and led them with his troops back to his estates in the Anatolic Theme.

===Revolt===
Nikephoros, seeing how dire the situation of the Byzantine Empire was, sent a letter to Emperor Michael in 1077 pleading with him to address the rapidly worsening situation in Byzantine Anatolia. Michael was insulted by the directness of one of his subordinates, and turned against Nikephoros, forcing him to rebel against Michael to protect himself from imprisonment. Nikephoros declared himself emperor shortly after, on 2 July/October 1077, mobilizing an army of native troops and Turkish mercenaries. Michael sent Nikephoros a letter in which he reminded Nikephoros that he owed much to the emperor who had brought him out of exile. A month later, in November 1077, the general Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder raised his own revolt against Michael. The military acumen and family renown of Nikephoros (III) helped him to solidify his support base, and the tyranny of Michael ensured that even some of the elites of Constantinople sided with Nikephoros—something Attaleiates notes as being very rare, since generally people defect from the usurper&#x27;s side to the emperor&#x27;s side. The defection of some of the capital elites was even more astonishing because the march from the Anatolic Theme to Constantinople was not safe due to Turkish raids, which had reached deep into Anatolia by 1078, meaning that Nikephoros″s rebellion might be destroyed before it even reached Constantinople. On 7 January 1078, the Byzantine Senate proclaimed Nikephoros III as emperor, although he was still far from the city. Michael&#x27;s wife, Maria of Alania, seeing that Michael would soon be overthrown, defected to the side of Nikephoros. Michael VII abdicated after a popular uprising and was forced to become a monk on 31 March. Three days later, on 3 April, Nikephoros entered Constantinople and seized the throne. Upon taking power, Nikephoros married Maria of Alania, exiled Michael to a monastery, a common Byzantine practice for removing threats to the throne since the 7th century, and castrated Michael&#x27;s sons. The castration of the sons was viewed poorly by the Byzantine nobility, possibly due to the brutality of the act, although Michael the Syrian does not provide an in-depth explanation of exactly why the Byzantine elite opposed it.

===Reign===

During the reign of Nikephoros, he had to contend with four revolts and plots before the revolt of Alexios I Komnenos which ultimately ended his reign. The first revolt was that of Nikephoros Bryennios, who had contended for the throne of Michael VII at the same time as Nikephoros III; Nikephoros, now too old to command armies, sent Alexios Komnenos to defeat him. Once Bryennios was defeated, Nikephoros III had him blinded, but granted him and his partisans amnesty. The second revolt came from a supporter of Bryennios, Nikephoros Basilakes the &quot;protoproedros&quot;, rebelled in Dyrrhachium (modern-day Durrës) in 1078, but he was quickly defeated by Alexios, and similarly blinded. In 1079 the Varangian Guard attempted to murder Nikephoros during an evening inspection, but they were unsuccessful as Nikephoros was able to command his retinue and defend himself until his imperial guards could arrive to defeat the Varangians. Nikephoros had the ringleaders of the plot sent to remote forts and granted amnesty to the rest. Around this time, Michael of Nicomedia, the &quot;hypertimos&quot; (head of the imperial administration), who may be the same person as Michael Psellos, died in Nicomedia; it is not known if his death was related to the assassination plot of the Varangians.

Around the same time, Constantine Doukas plotted against Nikephoros, despite the emperor&#x27;s favor towards him. Meanwhile, Nikephoros was planning to deal with Byzantine Anatolia, now practically overrun by the Seljuk Turks. Nikephoros hired mercenaries to strengthen his forces, as he viewed his native forces as being too little in number; however, the mercenaries were rowdy and disloyal. At one point Nikephoros had to personally address the mercenaries to attempt to make them cooperate. Constantine Doukas&#x27;s rebellion put an end to Nikephoros&#x27;s eastern campaign, but Nikephoros was popular enough that none outside of the immediate army under Constantine joined him, allowing Nikephoros to quickly assemble an army of levies and his imperial guard to challenge Constantine. Nikephoros quickly sent emissaries to Constantine to inquire why he had rebelled and was able to persuade the soldiers under Constantine to surrender their general through an offer of amnesty; after Constantine was handed over to Nikephoros by his own troops, he was sent into exile at a monastery.

In 1078 the Paulician sect attempted to use the chaos of the rebellions of Bryennios and Basilakes and their growing popularity in the Balkans to rise up against Nikephoros; Leca the Paulician agitated against Nikephoros and attempted to convince the Pechenegs, with whom Basilakes had earlier attempted to ally, to invade Byzantine land. At the same time, Dobromir the Paulician stirred up a revolt in Mesembria, in co-operation with Leca, and began to pillage the surrounding areas. Leca and Dobromir soon abandoned their rebellion after they were informed that Nikephoros was quickly assembling an army to defeat them. Knowing their few loyalists would not be able to confront the Byzantine army, they begged Nikephoros for forgiveness, fearing that they would share the same punishment as Bryennios and Basilakes; Nikephoros showed mercy and granted them amnesty, along with both gifts and titles.

Nikephoros had originally considered Constantine Doukas as a candidate for his heir, as he had no children of his own, but he abandoned this after Constantine revolted against him. He then set his sights upon a distant relative, Nikephoros Synadenos, of whom almost nothing is known other than that he later married a niece of Alexios.

Norman Duke Robert Guiscard of Apulia prepared to invade the Byzantine Empire in 1081 under the pretext of defending the succession of Constantine Doukas, who had been engaged to Robert&#x27;s daughter Helena; at the same time, the Seljuks captured the town of Cyzicus. Alexios was entrusted with a substantial army to defeat the Norman threat but conspired with his relative John Doukas to instead take the throne for himself. Alexios raised a rebellion against Nikephoros and was able to quickly surround Constantinople and put it to siege due to the lack of a defensive army. Nikeophoros was unable to secure the support of either the Seljuk Turks or Nikephoros Melissenos, his traditional rivals, and thus was forced to prepare to abdicate. Nikephoros decided that his only choice was to abdicate in favor of Melissenos, who was nearby in Damalis in Anatolia, and sent messengers to him across the Bosphorus; however, these messengers were intercepted by George Palaiologos, a general of Alexios, who persuaded them to support Alexios. Alexios and his forces broke through the walls of Constantinople on 1 April 1081 and sacked the city; Patriarch Cosmas convinced Nikephoros to abdicate to Alexios rather than prolong the civil war. Nikephoros then fled to the Hagia Sophia and sought sanctuary inside of it. Michael, the &quot;logothete&quot; of Alexios, then escorted Nikephoros to the Monastery of Peribleptus, where he abdicated and became a monk. He died later that year. Daniel Maynard comments that both Anthony Kaldellis and João Vicente de Medeiros Publio Dias tend to characterize Nikephoros&#x27; reign as part of the Doukas dynasty, with Kaldellis stating that &quot;Botaniates&#x27; reign was basically an extension of the Ducas dynasty&quot;, and de Medeiros Publio Dias stating that &quot;His government is normally only seen as a prelude to the important, but at the same time controversial rule of Alexios I Komnenos&quot;.

====Reforms and domestic policy====

Nikephoros performed many acts to secure the support of the Byzantine populace, as he lacked the legitimacy of imperial succession as a usurper. He spent large amounts of money on donatives for his army and supporters, which severely sapped the imperial treasury, and distributed many titles to them; he also donated generously to charities. He returned the gold and silver ornaments that Michael VII had confiscated from the churches to fund his civil war against him. Whether or not these acts managed to gain the support of the people cannot be ascertained, as Nikephoros″s reign was filled with revolts and political uncertainty; however, it can be assumed that he was determined to prevent the betrayal which many previous emperors had suffered, and as such freely handed out gifts and titles. Many of the reforms which Nikephoros enacted were more likely intended to solidify his tenuous hold on the throne, rather than for the security of the empire.

Nikephoros issued a chrysobull that forgave all debt which was in arrears in order to gain support and to attempt to remedy the debt crisis which had occurred under the Doukas dynasty; he also forbade creditors from demanding debt repayment before the terms of the contract stated, likely to improve the financial stability of the empire by preventing sudden impoverishment, and forbade creditors from seizing the property of their debtors in payment of debt after their debts were canceled. Attaleiates says that these laws &quot;put an end to the fear of debt&quot;, which he said had been a source of much suffering for the Byzantine citizens under the Doukas dynasty.

Nikephoros may have revoked the edicts of Michael VII to secure more legitimacy and to reward the citizens of Constantinople who had supported him; one such measure involved the restoration of rights to owners of small jetties around Constantinople, allowing them to again use these ports, called &quot;skalai&quot;. Attaleiates states that Nikephoros &quot;diligently attended the festivals of the capital and frequently bestowed gifts to his subjects&quot;, suggesting that Nikephoros did not hesitate to embrace the trappings of an emperor to ensure that he was viewed as the legitimate emperor rather than a mere usurper. Nikephoros worked to not only gain the favor of the masses, but also the previous dynasty, which Romanos IV had failed to do, leading to his downfall. He brought Eudokia Makrembolitissa out of her monastic exile and allowed her to live among her family, and attempted to make Constantine Doukas his heir, likely in an attempt to appease the civil officials who he had just deposed. Additionally, succession was a strong concern, as Nikephoros was a widower, old, and childless in 1078. His marriage to Maria, the wife of Michael VII, and attempt to take Constantine as his heir, show Nikephoros″s determination to both secure his succession and restore stability to the empire.

Attaleiates praised Nikephoros for his reforms to the legal code and his diligence in the performance of his imperial duties. Nikephoros presided over court cases and in his free time read books to improve his ability to judge cases. Nikephoros settled several pressing legal issues in 1079, first enacting a law regarding spousal insanity, the second increasing the time between sentencing and execution to thirty days to allow new evidence to be presented or the judge to review whether the crime merited capital punishment. Nikephoros also issued a law that extended the same legal rights and protections enjoyed by private servants to imperial servants. While the reforms of Nikephoros are quite minor, they provide insight into Nikephoros″s desire to relieve some of the issues plaguing the Byzantine Empire and correct the rampant corruption of the Byzantine courts; that his reforms were quite minor is unsurprising in light of the fact that Nikephoros was nearly eighty and had to suppress several revolts and defend against the Turks in Anatolia.

====Diplomacy====
The situation of Byzantine Anatolia worsened after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, as the Seljuk Turks began to take the Byzantine lands for themselves, rather than simply raid them. Theodore Gabras and Philaretos Brachamios, the governors of Trebizond and Antioch, respectively, had become separated from the rest of the Byzantine Empire as the Turks invaded other regions of Anatolia which were almost undefended, and thus became &quot;de facto&quot; independent of the Byzantine Empire. Nikephoros negotiated with Philaretos for the submission of his fief in 1078 and granted him the title of &quot;doux&quot;, leaving him the legitimate ruler of the newly returned Byzantine province. This reincorporation benefited the Byzantine Empire as Philaretos had been attacking some nearby Byzantine towns in order to incorporate them into his domain, dividing the Byzantines&#x27; focus upon the Seljuk Turks in the area. This successful negotiation may also have reflected the prestige of the Botaneiates family, as Michael Doukas had failed to negotiate a similar agreement with Philaretos because of Philaretos&#x27;s dislike of the corrupt Nikephoritzes the Logothete. While a diplomatic victory, it did not effectively change the situation of either party, as Philaretos remained effectively independent, and Nikephoros had little to gain from reasserting control over the land. The only real success to come from it is that he may have gained legitimacy due to achieving something which his predecessor was never able to; that Attaleiates deigns to mention it as one of Nikephoros&#x27;s successes lends credence to it largely benefiting only Nikephoros&#x27;s legitimacy.

<text>The demography of the Republic of Bulgaria is monitored by the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria. Demographic features of the population of Bulgaria include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and others.

Bulgaria has a Human Development Index of 0.799, ranking 70th in the world in 2022 and holds the 38th position in &quot;Newsweek&quot;&#x27;s rankings of the world&#x27;s best countries to live in, measuring health, education, political environment and economic dynamism.

==Demographic history==

Various estimates have put Bulgaria&#x27;s medieval population at 1.1 million in 700 AD and 2.6 million in 1365. At the 2011 census, the population inhabiting Bulgaria was 7,364,570 in total, but the 2021 Census calculated that the population had declined to 6.5 million. The peak was in 1989, the year when the borders opened after a half of a century of communist regime, when the population numbered 9,009,018.

Note: Crude migration change (per 1000) is an extrapolation

== Birth rates and fertility ==

===Historical birth and fertility rates===
The first reliable data about fertility and natural increase rates in the Bulgarian lands date back to the mid-1800s.

According to Turkish statistician Kemal Karpat, Non-Muslims, Bulgarians included, in the Ottoman Empire received a remarkable boost in fertility in the early 1830s. Their average growth rate climbed up to 2% per year, compared to zero among Muslims, who suffered from demographic stagnation.

The same trend continued well after Bulgaria&#x27;s Liberation from Ottoman rule in 1878. Until the early 1890s, Muslim birth rates in Bulgaria hesitated in the low 20s, dwarfed by rates of + 40‰ among Orthodox Christians, while natural increase rates hovered around zero. The ongoing Muslim demographic crisis and the heavy migration to Turkey were the two primary reasons for the rapid decrease in Bulgaria&#x27;s Muslim and Turkish population between 1880 and 1910, from 28.7% in 1880 to 13.8% in 1910 for Muslims and from 26.2% to 10.7% for Turks.

Muslim birth and natural increase rates started climbing slowly from the late 1890s but only surpassed Orthodox ones in 1924. Nevertheless, it was not the Eastern Orthodox but rather Bulgaria&#x27;s Roman Catholics that had the highest birth rate during the period, though usually offset by very high mortality rates.

Average Number of Births &amp; Deaths, Average Birth Rate, Death Rate and Rate of Natural Increase in the Principality of Bulgaria by Period and Confession




In the 1930s and 1940s, ethnic Bulgarians completed stage 2 of their demographic transition, and crude birth rate among them fell to a mere 23.3‰ by 1946, or twice as low as the birth rate of Bulgaria&#x27;s two largest minorities, Turks (40.9‰) and Roma (47.2‰). At the same time, due to higher mortality, the rate of natural increase among Bulgarian Turks was almost identical to that among ethnic Bulgarians (12.1‰ vs. 11.1‰), while the rate among the Romani was twice as high (23.1‰).

===Present-day===

A total of 64,984 live births were recorded in Bulgaria in 2016, giving the country a crude birth rate of 9.1‰.

Bulgaria has a low total fertility rate of 1.58 children per woman (according to the 2021 Census). This is up significantly from the late 1990s, but still below replacement and not enough to prevent further population decline, especially with emigration. Provinces with large Roma populations (for example Sliven, Montana and Yambol) tend to have higher fertility rates (and higher death rates) compared to other areas, whereas Turkish fertility is similar to the Bulgarian majority. The average number of (live births) children in 2021 was 1.47 for all women (aged 12 or more), ranging from 0.04 children for women between the ages of 12-19 to 1.92 children per women between the ages of 70-79. The distribution by ethnicity shows that only among women who identify themselves as belonging to the Roma ethnic group, the average number of children is sufficient for simple reproduction - 2.25 children, mainly because of the significantly younger age structure and low educational level of this group, followed by the Turkish ethnic group with 1.79 children and 1.41 children for women who self-identified as belonging to the Bulgarian ethnic. The distribution of the average number of live births by religion changes from 1.83 children for Muslim women and 1.82 children for Protestant women, followed by &#x27;other Christian&#x27; (1.63), Eastern Orthodox (1.43), Catholic (1.36), Jewish (1.27) and Armenian Apostolic (1.26). Women without religion had an average number of 1.40 children.
&lt;br&gt;

=== Regional differences ===

As of 2022, the municipality of Tvarditsa has the highest crude birth rate in the country, at 18.4‰, followed by the municipalities of Yablanitsa (17.9‰) and Nikolaevo Municipality (17.2‰). All these municipalities have relatively large Romani populations.
&lt;br&gt;

On the other hand, the municipalities of Georgi Damyanovo, Banite and Nevestino have incredibly low birth rates. These municipalities are almost exclusively inhabited by ethnic Bulgarians.

=== Teenage pregnancy ===

Bulgaria has one of the highest share of teenage pregnancy in Europe. Nevertheless, this number declined rapidly between 1995 and 2010, until it stabilized at around 10%.

The ten municipalities with the largest absolute number of teenage mothers for 2022 are: Sliven (371), Sofia (345), Plovdiv (196), Pazardzhik (130), Yambol (123), Nova Zagora (121), Burgas (108), Pleven (110), Tvarditsa (98), Stara Zagora, Varna (83) and Haskovo (81).

== Demographic policies ==

The progressive decrease of the Bulgarian population is hindering economic growth and welfare improvement, and the management measures taken to mitigate the negative consequences do not address the essence of the problem. The Government Program for the period 2017 - 2021 is the first one that aims at overturning the trend. The program also identifies the priority means for achieving this goal: measures to increase the birth rate, reduce youth emigration, and build up regulatory and institutional capacity to implement a modern immigration policy tailored to the needs of the Bulgarian business.

== Ethnic groups ==


&lt;br&gt;
The following table shows the ethnic composition of all Provinces of Bulgaria according to the 2021 census:

== Languages ==

The 2001 census defines an ethnic group as a &quot;community of people, related to each other by origin and language, and close to each other by mode of life and culture&quot;; and one&#x27;s mother tongue as &quot;the language a person speaks best and usually uses for communication in the family (household)&quot;.
According to the 2011 census, among the Bulgarians 99.4% indicate Bulgarian as a mother tongue, 0.3% - Turkish/Balkan gagauz, 0.1% - Roma and 0.1% others; among Turks 96.6% have pointed the Turkish/Balkan Gagauz as a mother tongue and 3.2% - Bulgarian; among the Roma 85% indicate Roma language as a mother tongue, 7.5% - Bulgarian, 6.7% - Turkish/Balkan gagauz and 0.6% - Romanian.

== Religion ==
Bulgaria&#x27;s traditional religion according to the constitution is the Orthodox Christianity, while Bulgaria is a secular state too. Since the last two censuses (2001 and 2011) provide widely divergent results, they are both shown in the table below. It is noteworthy that over a fifth of the population chose not to respond to this question in the 2011 census.


The results of the Bulgarian 2011 Census, in which the indication of answer regarding the question for confession was optional, are as follows:
The results of the Bulgarian 2001 Census by ethnic groups, the latest census in which the indication of identification (whether by confession or as irreligious) in the question for confession was obligatory, are as follows:

==Migration==
===Historical migration===
The first censuses of the Principality of Bulgaria and the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia in 1880 recorded 31,786 and 17,970 Bulgarian refugees from Macedonia and Ottoman Thrace, respectively, who accounted for 1.38% of the population of the Principality an 2.20% of the population of the autonomous province, respectively. The census of the Principality also counted a total of 37,635 people, or 1.88% of the population, born in a country other than the Ottoman Empire, mostly Bulgarians from Romania, Northern Dobruja and Bessarabia. By 1887, when the first joint census of the Principality and the autonomous province was conducted following their peaceful unification in 1885, the number of the refugees from the Ottoman Empire had grown to 54,462 people, or 1.73% of the population, while the rest of the foreign-born population had fallen to 31,637 people, 9,831 of whom born in the Russian Empire, 11,843 in Romania, 2,690 in Serbia and 7,273 elsewhere.

According to the 1910 census, 300,000 or almost 10% of the ethnic Bulgarians were born in another Bulgarian municipality than the one they were enumerated in. The same data shows that the foreign-born ethnic Bulgarians numbered 78,000, or 2% of them, most numerous of whom were the 61,000 Ottoman-born, 9,000 Romanian-born and by less than 2,000 Austro-Hungarian, Serbian and Russian-born. By the 1926 census, there had been 253,000 refugees with granted households and land or citizenship but with many more in towns of uncertain number. 35% came from Eastern Thrace, 30% came from Greek Macedonia, another 18% from Western Thrace, 8% from Dobruja, 4% from the Western Outlands, 3% from Asia Minor, and 2% from North Macedonia. They constituted 6% of the country&#x27;s population. In 1940, 70,000 Bulgarians were exchanged from Northern Dobruja. The total number of refugees in 1878-1940 is estimated at between 700,000 and 1,200,000. In 1950-1951, around 150,000 Turks left Bulgaria for Turkey, and again in 1989.

===Current migration===
According to the 2011 census Russian citizens are the most numerous foreigners - 11 991, followed by 8 444 EU citizens (UK- 2 605, Greece - 1 253, Germany- 848, Poland - 819 and Italy - 456), citizens of Ukraine - 3 064, North Macedonia - 1 091, Moldova - 893 and Serbia - 569. 22.8% of them are from Asia, mostly from Turkey. Those with dual Bulgarian and other citizenship were 22 152, or 0.3% of the population. Of them persons with Bulgarian and Russian citizenship were 5 257 (23.7%), followed by persons with Bulgarian and Turkish citizenship - 4 282 (19.3%), Bulgarian and citizenship of the USA- 1 725 (7.8%). There are at least 17,527 Refugees of the Syrian Civil War with applications in Bulgaria. In 2001-2015 185,447 people applied for Bulgarian citizenship and 116,222 were provided with. 113,647 were granted on grounds of proven Bulgarian ancestry, including 59,968 North Macedonia citizens. 29,218 were Moldovan citizens, 5930 Ukrainians, 5374 Serbians, 5194 Russians, 3840 Israeli, 2192 Albanians, 692 Turks and others. In 2016, 12,880 foreigners were naturalized, including 6196 Macedonians.

== Age structure ==
:0–14 years: 13.2%
:15–65 years: 68.3%
:65 years and over: 18.5% (Census 2011)
At the 2011 census, the largest cohort of those self-identified as Romani was the 0–9 years cohort, which accounted for 20.8% of all Romani. The same age cohort accounted for 10.2% of the Turks and 7.2% of the Bulgarians. At the 2021 census, the 0–9 years cohort amongst the Romani was second largest after the 10–19 years one and represented 17.0% of all Romani. The corresponding percentages for ethnic Bulgarians and ethnic Turks stood at 7.7% and 8.8%, respectively.


Bulgarian children constitute the majority of all children in 23 out of 28 provinces. They constitute more than ninety percent of all children in two provinces: Sofia (city) (92%) and Pernik Province (90%).

Turkish children constitute the majority in Kardzhali Province (68% of self-declared) and Razgrad Province (50% of self-declared); they also constitute the largest group of all children in Silistra Province (43%).

Roma children constitute 12% of all children in Bulgaria and more than a quarter in three provinces: Montana (29%), Sliven (28%) and Yambol (27%).

Bulgaria is ageing rapidly, especially in some remote rural areas.

The ageing of the population leads to an increase of the median age. The median age is 43.6 as of 2017, up from 40.4 years in 2001.

== Education ==

Over 98% of the population is literate, the males being more literate than the females.

According to the 2011 census, about 112,778 people aged nine or more are illiterate. There are considerable differences in the share of illiterate persons amongst the three main ethnic groups. Amongst the Bulgarian ethnic group the share of illiterate is 0.5%, amongst the Turkish - 4.7% and amongst the Roma ethnic group - 11.8%. About 81 thousand people aged seven or more never visited school.

== Unemployment ==
The number of unemployed people declined from 207000 people (or around 6.2% of the population) in 2017 to 156 657 in November 2023. The unemployment rate stood at 4.3 per cent in November 2023 according to Eurostat.

Most unemployed people are aged 15 to 24 years old.

The unemployment rate in rural areas (around 10.0%) is nearly two times higher than the unemployment rate in urban areas (approximately 5.1%).

Vidin Province has the highest unemployment rate with almost one fifth of its labour force being unemployed. The provinces of Shumen (15.9%), Silistra (12.5%) and Targovishte (12.4%) also have very high unemployment rates.

== Other statistics ==

=== Home ownership ===
According to Eurostat, 82.3% per cent of the population live in privately owned and owner-occupied homes, ranking it as 12th highest in ownership globally. It is down from a recent peak of 87.6% in 2008, and has been steadily falling since.

=== Internet penetration ===
The number of Internet users has increased rapidly since 2000—from 430,000 their number grew to 1.55 million in 2004, and 3.4 million (48 per cent penetration rate) in 2010. Bulgaria has the third-fastest average Broadband Internet speed in the world after South Korea and Romania with an average speed of 1,611 kbit/s.

=== Mobile phone adoption ===
Currently there are three active mobile phone operators—A1, Yettel and Vivacom, A1 is the largest one with 5.2 million users as of 2010, Yettel has 3,9 million as of 2007 and Vivacom over 1 million.

=== HIV ===
Bulgaria&#x27;s HIV rate is among the lowest in the world, being 0.1% or 3,800 infected as of 2009.

== Urbanization ==
Most Bulgarians (72.5 per cent) reside in urban areas. Approximately one-sixth of them live in Sofia, which has a population exceeding 1,200,000 people.

:Urban population: 5,338,261 or 72.5% of total population (Census 2011)
:Rural: 2,026,309 or 27.5%
:Rate of urbanization: -0.3% annual rate of change (2005–10 est.)

<doc id="74011" wikidata="Q245208" url="?curid=74011" title="High Noon">
<text>High Noon is a 1952 American Western film produced by Stanley Kramer from a screenplay by Carl Foreman, directed by Fred Zinnemann, and starring Gary Cooper. The plot, which occurs in real time, centers on a town marshal whose sense of duty is tested when he must decide to either face a gang of killers alone, or leave town with his new wife.

Though mired in controversy at the time of its release due to its political themes, the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four (Actor, Editing, Score and Song) as well as four Golden Globe Awards (Actor, Supporting Actress, Score, and Black and White Cinematography). The award-winning score was written by Ukraine-born composer Dimitri Tiomkin.

&quot;High Noon&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; in 1989. An iconic film whose story has been partly or completely repeated in later film productions, its ending in particular has inspired numerous later films, including but not just limited to westerns.

==Plot==
In Hadleyville, a small town in New Mexico Territory, Marshal Will Kane, newly married to Amy Fowler, prepares to retire. The happy couple will soon depart to raise a family and run a store in another town. However, word arrives that Frank Miller, a vicious outlaw whom Kane sent to prison, has been released and will arrive by the noon train, one day ahead of the new marshal. Miller&#x27;s gang—his younger brother Ben, Jack Colby, and Jim Pierce—wait at the station.

For Amy, a devout Quaker and pacifist, the solution is simple—leave town before Miller arrives—but Kane&#x27;s sense of duty and honor make him stay. Besides, he says, Miller and his gang would hunt him down anyway. Amy gives Kane an ultimatum: she is leaving on the noon train, with or without him.

Kane visits old friends and allies, but none can or will help. Judge Percy Mettrick, who sentenced Miller, flees and urges Kane to do the same. Harvey Pell, Kane&#x27;s young deputy, is bitter that Kane did not recommend him as his successor; he says he will stand with Kane only if Kane &quot;puts the word in&quot; for him with the city fathers. When Kane refuses, Pell turns in his badge and pistol. Kane&#x27;s efforts to round up a posse at Ramírez&#x27;s Saloon and the church are met with fear and hostility. Some townspeople, worried that a gunfight would damage the town&#x27;s reputation, urge Kane to avoid the confrontation. Some are Miller&#x27;s friends, but others resent that Kane cleaned up the town in the first place. Others believe that Kane&#x27;s fight is not the town&#x27;s responsibility. Sam Fuller hides in his house, forcing his wife Mildred to tell Kane he is not home. Jimmy offers to help, but he is blind in one eye, sweating, and unsteady. The mayor encourages Kane to leave town. Martin Howe, Kane&#x27;s predecessor, is too old and arthritic. Herb Baker agrees to be deputized, but backs out when he realizes he is the only volunteer. One last offer of help comes from 14-year-old Johnny. Kane admires his courage, but refuses his aid.

While waiting at the hotel for the train, Amy confronts Helen Ramírez, who was once Miller&#x27;s lover, then Kane&#x27;s, then Pell&#x27;s. Amy believes the reason Kane refuses to leave town is because he wants to protect Helen, but Helen reveals there is no lingering attachment on Kane&#x27;s part and she, too, is leaving. When Helen questions why Amy will not stay with Kane, Amy explains that both her brother and father were gunned down by criminals, a tragedy that converted her to Quakerism. Helen nonetheless chides Amy for not standing by her husband in his hour of need, saying that if she was in Amy&#x27;s place, she would take up a gun and fight alongside Kane.

Pell saddles a horse and tries to persuade Kane to take it. They end up in a fist fight. After knocking Pell senseless, Kane returns to his office to write out his will. As the clock ticks toward noon, Kane goes into the street to face Miller and his gang. Amy and Helen ride by on a wagon, bound for the train. The train arrives, and Miller steps off as the two ladies board.

Kane walks down the deserted main street alone. He manages to kill Frank Miller&#x27;s brother, Ben, in the opening salvo. Just before the train departs, Amy hears the gunfire and runs back to town. Kane takes refuge in a stable, and Colby is killed when he comes in after him. Miller sets fire to the stable to flush him out. Kane frees the horses and tries to escape on one, only to be shot off and cornered. Despite her religious beliefs, Amy picks up Pell&#x27;s pistol and shoots Pierce from behind, leaving only Frank Miller, who grabs Amy as a human shield to force Kane into the open. When Amy claws Miller&#x27;s face, he pushes her to the ground and Kane shoots him dead.

The couple embrace. As the townspeople emerge, Kane smiles at Johnny, but looks angrily at the rest of the crowd. He drops his marshal&#x27;s star to the street and departs with Amy.

==Production==
According to &quot;Darkness at High Noon: The Carl Foreman Documents&quot;—a 2002 documentary based in part on a lengthy 1952 letter from screenwriter Carl Foreman to film critic Bosley Crowther—Foreman&#x27;s role in the creation and production of &quot;High Noon&quot; has been unfairly downplayed over the years in favor of producer Stanley Kramer&#x27;s. Foreman told Crowther that the film originated from a four-page plot outline he wrote that turned out to be very similar to a short story by John W. Cunningham entitled &quot;The Tin Star&quot;. Foreman purchased the film rights to Cunningham&#x27;s story and wrote the screenplay. By the time the documentary aired, most of the principals were dead, including Kramer, Foreman, Zinnemann, and Cooper. Victor Navasky, author of &quot;Naming Names&quot;, an authoritative account of the Hollywood blacklist, told a reporter that, based on his interviews with Kramer&#x27;s widow and others, the documentary seemed &quot;one-sided, and the problem is it makes a villain out of Stanley Kramer, when it was more complicated than that&quot;.

Years later, director Richard Fleischer claimed that he helped Foreman develop the story of &quot;High Noon&quot; over the course of eight weeks while driving to and from the set of the 1949 film &quot;The Clay Pigeon&quot;, which they were making together. Fleischer said that his RKO contract prevented him from directing &quot;High Noon&quot;.

There is a description of an incident very similar to the central plotline of &quot;High Noon&quot; in Chapter XXXV of &quot;The Virginian&quot;, by Owen Wister, in which Trampas (a villain) calls out The Virginian, who has a new bride waiting whom he might lose if he engages in a gunfight. &quot;High Noon&quot; has even been described as a &quot;straight remake&quot; of the 1929 film version of &quot;The Virginian&quot;, which also featured Gary Cooper in a starring role.

===House Un-American Activities Committee controversy===
The production and release of &quot;High Noon&quot; intersected with the Second Red Scare in the United States and the Korean War. In 1951, during production of the film, screenwriter Carl Foreman was summoned before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) during its investigation of &quot;Communist propaganda and influence&quot; in the motion picture industry. Foreman had once been a member of the Communist Party, but he declined to identify fellow members or anyone he suspected of current membership. As a result, he was labeled an &quot;uncooperative witness&quot; by the committee, making him vulnerable to blacklisting by the movie industry.

After his refusal to name names was made public, Foreman&#x27;s production partner Stanley Kramer demanded an immediate dissolution of their partnership. As a signatory to the production loan, Foreman remained with the &quot;High Noon&quot; project, but before the film&#x27;s release, he sold his partnership share to Kramer and moved to Britain, knowing that he would not find further work in the United States.

Kramer later asserted that he had ended their partnership because Foreman had threatened to falsely name him to HUAC as a Communist. Foreman said that Kramer feared damage to his own career due to &quot;guilt by association&quot;. Foreman was indeed blacklisted by the Hollywood studios due to the &quot;uncooperative witness&quot; label along with pressure from Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn, MPA president John Wayne, and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gossip columnist Hedda Hopper.

===Casting===

John Wayne was originally offered the lead role in the film, but refused it because he believed that Foreman&#x27;s story was an obvious allegory against blacklisting, which he actively supported. Later, he told an interviewer that he would &quot;never regret having helped run Foreman out of the country&quot;. Gary Cooper was Wayne&#x27;s longtime friend and shared his conservative political views; Cooper had been a &quot;friendly witness&quot; before HUAC but did not implicate anyone as a suspected Communist, and he later became a vigorous opponent of blacklisting. Cooper won an Academy Award for his performance, and since he was working in Europe at the time, he asked Wayne to accept the Oscar on his behalf. Although Wayne&#x27;s contempt for the film and refusal of its lead role were well known, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m glad to see they&#x27;re giving this to a man who is not only most deserving, but has conducted himself throughout the years in our business in a manner that we can all be proud of ... Now that I&#x27;m through being such a good sport ... I&#x27;m going back to find my business manager and agent ... and find out why I didn&#x27;t get &quot;High Noon&quot; instead of Cooper ...&quot;

After Wayne refused the Will Kane role, Kramer offered it to Gregory Peck, who declined because he felt it was too similar to his role in &quot;The Gunfighter&quot;, the year before. Peck later said he considered it the biggest mistake of his career. Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, and Charlton Heston also declined the role.

Kramer saw Grace Kelly in an off-Broadway play and cast her as Kane&#x27;s bride, despite Cooper and Kelly&#x27;s substantial age disparity (50 and 21, respectively). Rumors of an affair between Cooper and Kelly during filming remain unsubstantiated. Kelly biographer Donald Spoto wrote that there was no evidence of a romance, aside from tabloid gossip. Biographer Gina McKinnon speculated that &quot;there might well have been a roll or two in the hay bales&quot;, but cited no evidence, other than a remark by Kelly&#x27;s sister Lizanne that Kelly was &quot;infatuated&quot; with Cooper.

Lee Van Cleef made his film debut in &quot;High Noon&quot;. Kramer first offered Van Cleef the Harvey Pell role, after seeing him in a touring production of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, on the condition that Van Cleef have his nose surgically altered to appear less menacing. Van Cleef refused and was cast instead as Colby, the only role of his career without a single line of dialog.

===Filming===
&quot;High Noon&quot; was filmed in the late summer/early fall of 1951 in several locations in California. The opening scenes, under the credits, were shot at Iverson Movie Ranch near Los Angeles. A few town scenes were shot in Columbia State Historic Park, a preserved Gold Rush mining town near Sonora, but most of the street scenes were filmed on the Columbia Movie Ranch in Burbank. St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in Tuolumne City was used for exterior shots of the Hadleyville church. The railroad was the old Sierra Railroad in Jamestown, a few miles south of Columbia, now known as Railtown 1897 State Historic Park, and often nicknamed &quot;the movie railroad&quot; due to its frequent use in films and television shows. The railroad station was built for the film alongside a water tower at Warnerville, about 15 miles to the southwest.

Cooper was reluctant to film the fight scene with Bridges due to ongoing problems with his back, but eventually did so without the use of a stunt double. He wore no makeup to emphasize his character&#x27;s anguish and fear, which was probably intensified by pain from recent surgery to remove a bleeding ulcer.

The running time of the story almost precisely parallels the running time of the film—an effect heightened by frequent shots of clocks to remind the characters (and the audience) that the villain will be arriving on the noon train.

===Music===
The movie&#x27;s theme song, &quot;High Noon&quot; (as it is credited in the film), also known by its opening lyric, &quot;Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling&quot;, became a major hit on the country-and-western charts for Tex Ritter, and later, a pop hit for Frankie Laine as well. Its popularity set a precedent for theme songs that were featured in many subsequent Western films. Composer Dimitri Tiomkin&#x27;s score and song, with lyrics by Ned Washington, became popular for years afterwards and Tiomkin became in demand for future westerns in the 1950s like &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; and &quot;Last Train from Gun Hill.&quot;

==Reception==
The film earned $3.75 million in theatrical rentals at the North American box office in 1952.

Upon its release, critics and audiences expecting chases, fights, spectacular scenery, and other common Western film elements were dismayed to find them largely replaced by emotional and moralistic dialogue until the climactic final scenes. Some critics scoffed at the unorthodox rescue of the hero by the heroine. David Bishop argued that had Quaker Amy &quot;not&quot; helped her husband by shooting a man in the back, such inaction would have pulled pacifism &quot;toward apollonian decadence&quot;. Alfred Hitchcock thought Kelly&#x27;s performance was &quot;rather mousy&quot; and lacking in animation; only in later films, he said, did she show her true star quality.

&quot;High Noon&quot; has been cited as a favorite by several U.S. presidents. Dwight Eisenhower screened the film at the White House, and Bill Clinton hosted a record 17 White House screenings of it. &quot;It&#x27;s no accident that politicians see themselves as Gary Cooper in &quot;High Noon&quot;,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;Not just politicians, but anyone who&#x27;s forced to go against the popular will. Any time you&#x27;re alone and you feel you&#x27;re not getting the support you need, Cooper&#x27;s Will Kane becomes the perfect metaphor.&quot; Ronald Reagan cited &quot;High Noon&quot; as his favorite film, due to the protagonist&#x27;s strong commitment to duty and the law.

By contrast, John Wayne told an interviewer that he considered &quot;High Noon&quot; &quot;the most un-American thing I&#x27;ve ever seen in my whole life,&quot; and later teamed with director Howard Hawks to make &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; in response. &quot;I made &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; because I didn&#x27;t like &quot;High Noon&quot;,&quot; Hawks explained. &quot;Neither did Duke [Wayne]. I didn&#x27;t think a good town marshal was going to run around town like a chicken with his head cut off asking everyone to help. And who saves him? His Quaker wife. That isn&#x27;t my idea of a good Western.&quot;

Zinnemann responded, &quot;I admire Hawks very much. I only wish he&#x27;d leave my films alone!&quot; In a 1973 interview, Zinnemann added, &quot;I&#x27;m rather surprised at Hawks&#x27; and Wayne&#x27;s thinking. Sheriffs are people and no two people are alike. The story of &quot;High Noon&quot; takes place in the Old West but it is really a story about a man&#x27;s conflict of conscience. In this sense it is a cousin to &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;. In any event, respect for the Western hero has not been diminished by &quot;High Noon&quot;.&quot;

The film was criticized in the Soviet Union as &quot;glorification of the individual&quot;.

==Legacy and cultural influence==
&quot;High Noon&quot; is considered an early example of the revisionist Western. Kim Newman calls it the &quot;most influential Western of the 1950s (because) its attitudes subtly changed the societal vision of the whole (Western) genre&quot;. The traditional format of the Western is of a strong male character leading the civilized against the uncivilized but in this film, the civilized people fail (in a way described by John Wayne as &quot;un-American&quot;) to support their town marshal. Newman draws the contrast between the &quot;eerily neat and civilised&quot; town of Hadleyville and the &quot;gutlessness, self-interest and lack of backbone exhibited by its inhabitants&quot; who will allow the town to &quot;slip back into the savage past&quot; from which Kane and his deputies once saved it.

In his article, &quot;The Women of &quot;High Noon&quot;: A Revisionist View&quot;, Don Graham argues that in addition to the man-alone theme, &quot;High Noon&quot; &quot;represents a notable advance in the portrayal of women in Westerns&quot;. Compared with the &quot;hackneyed presentation&quot; of stereotypical women characters in earlier Westerns, &quot;High Noon&quot; grants the characters of Amy and Helen an expanded presence, the two being counterpoints. While Helen is socially inferior, she holds considerable economic power in the community. Helen&#x27;s encounter with Amy is key because she tells Amy that she would never leave Kane if he were her man – she would get a gun and fight, thus predicting Amy&#x27;s actions. For most of the film, Amy is the &quot;Eastern-virgin archetype&quot; but her reaction to the first gunshot &quot;transcends the limitations of her genre role&quot; as she returns to town and kills Pierce.

The gang&#x27;s actions indicate the implicit but very real threat they pose to women, as is suggested by the Mexican woman crossing herself when the first three ride into town. Graham summarizes the many references to women as a community demoralized by the failure of its male members, other than Kane. The women, he asserts, equal Kane in strength of character to the extent that they are &quot;protofeminists&quot;.

In 1989, 22-year-old Polish graphic designer Tomasz Sarnecki transformed Marian Stachurski&#x27;s 1959 Polish variant of the &quot;High Noon&quot; poster into a Solidarity election poster for the first partially free elections in communist Poland. The poster, which was displayed all over Poland, shows Cooper armed with a folded ballot saying &quot;Wybory&quot; (i.e., elections) in his right hand while the Solidarity logo is pinned to his vest above the sheriff&#x27;s badge. The message at the bottom of the poster reads: &quot;W samo południe: 4 czerwca 1989&quot;, which translates to &quot;High Noon: 4 June 1989.&quot;

As former Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa wrote, in 2004,

The 1981 science fiction film &quot;Outland&quot;, starring Sean Connery as a federal agent on an interplanetary mining outpost, has been compared to &quot;High Noon&quot; due to similarities in themes and plot.

&quot;High Noon&quot; is referenced several times on the HBO drama series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Tony Soprano cites Gary Cooper&#x27;s character as the archetype of what a man should be, mentally tough and stoic. He frequently laments, &quot;Whatever happened to Gary Cooper?&quot; and refers to Will Kane as the &quot;strong, silent type&quot;. The iconic ending to the film is shown on a television during an extended dream sequence in the fifth-season episode &quot;The Test Dream&quot;.

&quot;High Noon&quot; inspired the 2008 hip-hop song of the same name by rap artist Kinetics, in which &quot;High Noon&quot; is mentioned along with several other classic Western films, drawing comparisons between rap battles and Western-film street showdowns.

==Sequels and remakes==
* A television sequel, &quot;High Noon, Part II: The Return of Will Kane&quot;, was produced in 1980, and aired on CBS in November of that year. Lee Majors and Katherine Cannon played the Cooper and Kelly roles. Elmore Leonard wrote the original screenplay.
*&quot;Outland&quot; is a 1981 British science fiction thriller film written and directed by Peter Hyams and starring Sean Connery, Peter Boyle, and Frances Sternhagen that was inspired by &quot;High Noon&quot;.
* In 2000, Stanley Kramer&#x27;s widow Karen Sharpe Kramer produced a remake of &quot;High Noon&quot; as a TV movie for the cable channel TBS. The film starred Tom Skerritt as Will Kane, with Michael Madsen as Frank Miller.
* In 2016, Karen Kramer signed an agreement with Relativity Studios for a feature film remake of &quot;High Noon&quot;, a modernized version set in the present day at the US-Mexico border. That deal collapsed when Relativity declared bankruptcy the following year, but in 2018, Kramer announced that Classical Entertainment had purchased the rights to the project, which will be produced by Thomas Olaimey with writer-director David L. Hunt. As of 2024, there have been no further developments on it.

<text>Romanos I Lakapenos or Lekapenos (, &quot;Rōmanos Lakapēnos&quot; or &quot;Lekapēnos&quot;; 870 – 15 June 948), Latinized as Romanus I Lecapenus, was Byzantine emperor from 920 until his deposition in 944, serving as regent for and senior co-ruler of the young Constantine VII.

==Origin==
Romanos derived his epithet, now usually treated as a family name, from his birthplace of Lakape (later Laqabin) between Melitene and Samosata. It is found mostly as Lakapenos in the sources, although English-language scholarship in particular prefers the form Lekapenos, in large part due to Sir Steven Runciman&#x27;s 1928 study on the emperor. He was the son of a peasant with the remarkable name of Theophylact &quot;the Unbearable&quot; (&quot;Theophylaktos Abastaktos&quot;), who had rescued the Emperor Basil I from the enemy in battle at Tephrike and had been rewarded by a place in the Imperial Guard. Theophylaktos is usually identified as Armenian. Byzantinist Anthony Kaldellis contests this, saying that Armenian ancestry is not mentioned in the many Byzantine sources which discuss Romanos, and that Theophylaktos&#x27; alleged ethnicity is an assumption based on his being born in humble circumstances in the Armeniac Theme. The assumption has been repeated so often in literature that it has acquired the status of a known fact, even though it is based on the most tenuous of indirect connections.
Although he did not receive any refined education (for which he was later abused by his son-in-law Constantine VII), Romanos advanced through the ranks of the army during the reign of Emperor Leo VI the Wise. In 911 he was general of the naval theme of Samos and later served as admiral of the fleet (&quot;droungarios tou ploimou&quot;). In this capacity he was supposed to participate in the Byzantine operations against Bulgaria on the Danube in 917, but he was unable to carry out his mission. In the aftermath of the disastrous Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Acheloos in 917 by the Bulgarians, Romanos sailed to Constantinople, where he gradually overcame the discredited regency of Empress Zoe Karvounopsina and her supporter Leo Phokas.
==Rise to power==
On 25 March 919, at the head of his fleet, Lekapenos seized the Boukoleon Palace and the reins of government. Initially, he was named &quot;magistros&quot; and &quot;megas hetaireiarches&quot;, but he moved swiftly to consolidate his position: in April 919 his daughter Helena was married to Constantine VII, and Lekapenos assumed the new title &quot;basileopator&quot;. On 24 September 920, he was named &quot;caesar&quot;; and on 17 December, Romanos was crowned senior emperor.

In subsequent years Romanos crowned his own sons co-emperors, Christopher in 921, Stephen and Constantine in 924, although, for the time being, Constantine VII was regarded as first in rank after Romanos himself. It is notable that, as he left Constantine VII untouched, he was called &#x27;the gentle usurper&#x27;. Romanos strengthened his position by marrying his daughters to members of the powerful aristocratic families of Argyros and Mouseles, by recalling the deposed patriarch Nicholas Mystikos, and by putting an end to the conflict with the Papacy over the four marriages of Emperor Leo VI.

His early reign saw several conspiracies to topple him, which led to the successive dismissal of his first &quot;paradynasteuontes&quot;, John the Rhaiktor and John Mystikos. From 925 and until the end of his reign, the post was occupied by the chamberlain Theophanes.

==War and peace with Bulgaria==
The first major challenge faced by the new emperor was the war with Bulgaria, which had been re-ignited by the regency of Zoe. The rise to power of Romanos had curtailed the plans of Simeon I of Bulgaria for a marital alliance with Constantine VII, and Romanos was determined to deny the unpopular concession of imperial recognition to Simeon, which had already toppled two imperial governments. Consequently, the first four years of Romanos&#x27; reign were spent in warfare against Bulgaria. Although Simeon generally had the upper hand, he was unable to gain a decisive advantage because of the impregnability of Constantinople&#x27;s walls. In 924, when Simeon had once again blockaded the capital by land, Romanos succeeded in opening negotiations.
Meeting Simeon in person at Kosmidion, Romanos criticized Simeon&#x27;s disregard for tradition and Orthodox Christian brotherhood and supposedly shamed him into coming to terms and lifting the siege. In reality, this was accomplished by Romanos&#x27; tacit recognition of Simeon as emperor of Bulgaria. Relations were subsequently marred by continued wrangling over titles (Simeon called himself emperor of the &quot;Romans&quot; as well), but peace had been effectively established.

On the death of Simeon in May 927, Bulgaria&#x27;s new emperor, Peter I, made a show of force by invading Byzantine Thrace, but he showed himself ready to negotiate for a more permanent peace. Romanos seized the occasion and proposed a marriage alliance between the imperial houses of Byzantium and Bulgaria, at the same time renewing the Serbian-Byzantine alliance with Časlav of Serbia, returning independence the same year. In September 927 Peter arrived before Constantinople and married Maria (renamed Eirene, &quot;Peace&quot;), the daughter of Romanos&#x27; eldest son and co-emperor Christopher, and thus his granddaughter. On this occasion Christopher received precedence in rank over his brother-in-law Constantine VII, something which compounded the latter&#x27;s resentment towards the Lekapenoi, the Bulgarians, and imperial marriages to outsiders (as documented in his composition &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;). From this point on, Romanos&#x27; government was free from direct military confrontation with Bulgaria. Although Byzantium would tacitly support a Serbian revolt against Bulgaria in 931, and the Bulgarians would allow Magyar raids across their territory into Byzantine possessions, Byzantium and Bulgaria remained at peace for 40 years, until Sviatoslav&#x27;s invasion of Bulgaria.

==Campaigns in the East==
Romanos appointed the brilliant general John Kourkouas commander of the field armies (&quot;domestikos ton scholon&quot;) in the East. John Kourkouas subdued a rebellion in the theme of Chaldia and intervened in Armenia in 924. From 926 Kourkouas campaigned across the eastern frontier against the Abbasids and their vassals, and won an important victory at Melitene in 934. The capture of this city is often considered the first major Byzantine territorial recovery from the Muslims.

In 941, while most of the army under Kourkouas was absent in the East, a fleet of 15 old ships under the &quot;protovestiarios&quot; Theophanes had to defend Constantinople from a Kievan raid. The invaders were defeated at sea, through the use of Greek fire, and again at land, when they landed in Bithynia, by the returning army under Kourkouas. In 944 Romanos concluded a treaty with Prince Igor of Kiev. This crisis having passed, Kourkouas was free to return to the eastern frontier.
In 943 Kourkouas invaded northern Mesopotamia and besieged the important city of Edessa in 944. As the price for his withdrawal, Kourkouas obtained one of Byzantium&#x27;s most prized relics, the &quot;mandylion&quot;, the holy towel allegedly sent by Jesus Christ to King Abgar V of Edessa. 

John Kourkouas, although considered by some of his contemporaries &quot;a second Trajan or Belisarius,&quot; was dismissed after the fall of the Lekapenoi in 945. Nevertheless, his campaigns in the East paved the way for the even more dramatic reconquests in the middle and the second half of the 10th century.

==Internal policies==
Romanos I Lekapenos attempted to strengthen the Byzantine Empire by seeking peace everywhere that it was possible—his dealings with Bulgaria and Kievan Rus&#x27; have been described above. To protect Byzantine Thrace from Magyar incursions (such as the ones in 934 and 943), Romanos paid them protection money and pursued diplomatic avenues. The Khazars were the allies of the Byzantines until the reign of Romanos, when he started persecuting the Jews of the empire. According to the Schechter Letter, the Khazar ruler Joseph responded to the persecution of Jews by &quot;doing away with many Christians&quot;, and Romanos retaliated by inciting Oleg of Novgorod (called &quot;Helgu&quot; in the letter) against Khazaria.

Similarly, Romanos re-established peace within the church and overcame the new conflict between Rome and Constantinople by promulgating the &quot;Tomos of Union&quot; in 920. In 933 Romanos took advantage of a vacancy on the patriarchal throne to name his young son Theophylaktos patriarch of Constantinople. The new patriarch did not achieve renown for his piety and spirituality, but he added theatrical elements to the Byzantine liturgy and was an avid horse-breeder, allegedly leaving mass to tend to one of his favorite mares when she was giving birth.

Romanos was active as a legislator, promulgating a series of laws to protect small landowners from being swallowed up by the estates of the land-owning nobility (&quot;dynatoi&quot;). The legislative reform may have been partly inspired by hardship caused by the famine of 927 and the subsequent semi-popular revolt of Basil the Copper Hand. The emperor also managed to increase the taxes levied on the aristocracy and established the state on a more secure financial footing. Romanos was also able to effectively subdue revolts in several provinces of the empire, most notably in Chaldia, the Peloponnese, and Southern Italy.

He incorporated the Armenian fortress of Citharizum into the empire in 942 and renamed it Romanopolis (Ρωμανούπολις). In Constantinople, he built his palace in the place called Myrelaion, near the Sea of Marmara. Beside it Romanos built a shrine which became the first example of a private burial church of a Byzantine emperor. Moreover, he erected a chapel devoted to Christ Chalkites near the Chalke Gate, the monumental entrance to the Great Palace.

==End of the reign==

Romanos&#x27; later reign was marked by the old emperor&#x27;s heightened interest in divine judgment and his increasing sense of guilt for his role in the usurpation of the throne from Constantine VII. On the death of Christopher, by far his most competent son, in 931, Romanos did not advance his younger sons in precedence over Constantine VII. Fearing that Romanos would allow Constantine VII to succeed him instead of them, his younger sons Stephen and Constantine arrested their father on 20 (or 16) December 944, carried him off to the Princes&#x27; Islands and compelled him to become a monk. When they threatened the position of Constantine VII, however, the people of Constantinople revolted, and Stephen and Constantine were likewise stripped of their imperial rank and sent into exile to their father. Romanos died on 15 June 948, and was buried as the other members of his family in the church of Myrelaion.

Having lived long under constant threat of deposition—or worse—by the Lekapenoi family, Constantine VII was extremely resentful of them. In his &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; manual written for his son and successor, Romanos II, he minces no words about his late father-in-law: &quot;the lord Romanus the Emperor was an idiot and an illiterate man, neither bred in the high imperial manner, nor following Roman custom from the beginning, nor of imperial or noble descent, and therefore the more rude and authoritarian in doing most things ... for his beliefs were uncouth, obstinate, ignorant of what is good, and unwilling to adhere to what is right and proper.&quot;

==Family==
Romanos I&#x27;s only named wife is Theodora, who died in 922. However, genealogical and chronological considerations have led to the hypothesis that his three eldest children may have been born from an otherwise unattested first marriage. Romanos had at least eight legitimate and at least one illegitimate children, leading to numerous aristocratic descendants and connections in the Middle Byzantine period, including every emperor for the next century.

<doc id="74018" wikidata="Q1066714" url="?curid=74018" title="His Girl Friday">
<text>His Girl Friday is a 1940 American screwball comedy film directed by Howard Hawks, starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell and featuring Ralph Bellamy and Gene Lockhart. It was released by Columbia Pictures. The plot centers on a newspaper editor named Walter Burns who is about to lose his ace reporter and ex-wife, Hildy Johnson, newly engaged to another man. Burns suggests they cover one more story together, getting themselves entangled in the case of murderer Earl Williams as Burns desperately tries to win back his wife. The screenplay was adapted from the 1928 play &quot;The Front Page&quot; by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. This was the second time the play had been adapted for the screen, the first occasion being the 1931 film which kept the original title &quot;The Front Page&quot;.

The script for &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; was written by Charles Lederer and Ben Hecht, the latter of whom is not credited for his contributions. The major change in this version, introduced by Hawks, is that the role of Hildy Johnson is a woman. Filming began in September 1939 and finished in November, seven days behind schedule. Production was delayed because the frequent improvisation and numerous ensemble scenes required many retakes. Hawks encouraged his actors to be aggressive and spontaneous. &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; has been noted for its surprises, comedy, and rapid, overlapping dialogue. Hawks was determined to break the record for the fastest film dialogue, at the time held by &quot;The Front Page&quot;. He used a sound mixer on the set to increase the speed of dialogue and held a showing of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his film was.

&quot;His Girl Friday&quot; was #19 on American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Laughs and was selected in 1993 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film is in the public domain because the copyright was not renewed; the play it was based on remained under copyright for several decades until it expired in 2024, fully releasing the film from remaining copyright.

==Plot==

Walter Burns, the hard-boiled editor for &quot;The Morning Post&quot; of Chicago, learns his ex-wife and former star reporter, Hildegard &quot;Hildy&quot; Johnson, is about to marry insurance man Bruce Baldwin and settle down as a housewife in Albany. Walter, determined to sabotage these plans, entices a reluctant Hildy to cover one last story: the execution of Earl Williams, a white bookkeeper portrayed as a shy, confused man, convicted of murdering a black policeman. Walter is committed to stop the execution, claiming it is a political move to get the Mayor reelected, since the victim is &quot;of color&quot;. Hildy agrees on the condition that Walter buy a $100,000 life insurance policy from Bruce so he can receive a $1,000 commission. In the meantime, she bribes the warden to let her interview Williams in jail. She induces the convicted man to make a compelling argument in his defense, that he was not fully aware of his own actions when he shot the police officer.

Walter does everything he can to keep Hildy from marrying Bruce, eventually accusing her fiancé of stealing a watch, forcing Hildy to bail him out of jail. Exasperated, Hildy quits, but when the convicted man escapes, her journalistic instincts take over. Walter frames Bruce again, and he is immediately sent back to jail. Hildy realizes that Walter is behind the shenanigans, but she prioritizes covering the rapidly escalating Williams story over bailing Bruce out again.

On the run, Williams sneaks into the deserted press room and holds Hildy at gunpoint; the lure of a big scoop proves too tempting for her to resist. Williams&#x27;s girlfriend Mollie comes looking for him. When the other reporters return, Hildy hides the fugitive in a rolltop desk. Mrs. Baldwin, Hildy&#x27;s future mother-in-law, enters and berates her for the way she is treating Bruce. Upon being harassed for Williams&#x27;s whereabouts by the reporters, Mollie jumps out of the window. The reporters rush out, saving Williams from being found. Walter arrives and has his henchman Louie kidnap Mrs. Baldwin.

Bruce comes into the press room, having wired Albany for his bail and asking for his mother&#x27;s whereabouts. Hildy is so consumed with writing the story that she hardly notices; Bruce realizes his cause is hopeless and leaves. A disheveled Louie returns, revealing that he had hit a police car while driving away with Mrs. Baldwin and is unsure if she survived in the accident.

Meanwhile, the mayor and sheriff, portrayed as crooked, are informed that the &quot;reds&quot; in the city are gathering in support of the execution. The sheriff has no issues against the &quot;reds&quot;, so he suggests to try to get closer to such voters; the Mayor explains that all that is needed is their approval to keep their jobs in the upcoming election. So, when a messenger brings them a reprieve from the governor, they try to bribe the man to go away and return later, after it is too late.

After Williams is discovered in the desk, Walter and Hildy are handcuffed by the sheriff. However, the messenger returns with the reprieve, just in time to save Williams from the gallows. Walter uses the messenger&#x27;s statements to blackmail the mayor and sheriff into releasing him and Hildy. Hildy receives a call from Bruce, again in jail because of counterfeit money that was unknowingly transferred to him by Hildy from Walter. Hildy breaks down and admits to Walter that she was afraid that he was going to let her marry Bruce without a fight.

After bailing Bruce out of jail again, Walter asks Hildy to remarry him and promises to take her on the honeymoon they never had in Niagara Falls. Then Walter learns that there is a strike in Albany, which is on the way to Niagara Falls. Hildy agrees to honeymoon in Albany, accepting that Walter will never change.

===Development and writing===
While producing &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot; (1939), Howard Hawks tried to pitch a remake of &quot;The Front Page&quot; to Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures. Cary Grant was almost immediately cast in the film, but Cohn initially intended Grant to play the reporter, with radio commentator Walter Winchell as the editor. Hawks&#x27; production that became &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; was originally intended to be a straightforward adaptation of &quot;The Front Page&quot;, with both the editor and reporter being male. During auditions, Howard Hawks&#x27; secretary, a woman, read reporter Hildy Johnson&#x27;s lines. Hawks liked the way the dialogue sounded coming from a woman, resulting in the script being rewritten to make Hildy female and the ex-wife of editor Walter Burns played by Cary Grant. Cohn purchased the rights for &quot;The Front Page&quot; in January 1939.

Although Hawks considered the dialogue of &quot;The Front Page&quot; to be &quot;the finest modern dialogue that had been written&quot;, more than half of it was replaced with what Hawks believed to be better lines. Some of the original dialogue was left the same, as were all of the characters&#x27; names with two exceptions: Hildy&#x27;s fiancé (now no longer a fiancée) was given the name Bruce Baldwin, and the name of the comic messenger bringing the pardon from the governor was changed from Pincus to Pettibone. Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures approved Hawks&#x27; idea for the film project. Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, the writers of the original play, were unavailable for screenwriting. Consequently, Hawks considered Gene Fowler as the screenwriter, but he declined the job because he disliked the changes to the screenplay Hawks intended to make. Hawks instead recruited Charles Lederer, who had worked on the adaptation for &quot;The Front Page&quot;, to work on the screenplay. Though he was not credited, Hecht assisted Lederer in the adaptation. Additions were made at the beginning of the screenplay by Lederer to give the characters a convincing backstory; it was decided that Hildy and Walter would be divorced with Hildy&#x27;s intentions of remarriage serving as Walter&#x27;s motivation to win her back.

During writing, Hawks was in Palm Springs directing &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot;, but stayed in close contact with Lederer and Hecht. Hecht helped Lederer with some organizational revisions, and Lederer finished the script on May 22. After two more drafts completed by July, Hawks called Morrie Ryskind to revise the dialogue and make it more interesting. Ryskind revised the script throughout the summer and finished by the end of September before filming began. More than half of the original dialogue was rewritten. The film lacks one of the well-known final lines of the play, &quot;the son-of-a-bitch stole my watch!&quot;, because films of the time were more censored than Pre-Code Hollywood films, and Hawks felt that the line was too overused. Ryskind developed a new ending in which Walter and Hildy start fighting immediately after saying &quot;I do&quot; in the wedding they hold in the newsroom, with one of the characters stating, &quot;I think it&#x27;s gonna turn out all right this time.&quot; However, after revealing the ending to a few writers at Columbia one evening, Ryskind was surprised to hear that his ending was filmed on another set a few days later. Forced to create another ending, Ryskind ended up thanking the anonymous Columbia writer, because he felt that his ending and one of his final lines, &quot;I wonder if Bruce can put us up&quot;, were better than what he had written originally. After reviewing the screenplay, the Hays Office saw no issues with the film, besides a few derogatory comments towards newsmen and some illegal behavior of the characters. During some rewrites for censors, Hawks focused on finding a lead actress for his film.

===Casting===

Hawks had difficulty casting &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;. While the choice of Cary Grant was almost instantaneous, the casting of Hildy was a more extended process. At first, Hawks wanted Carole Lombard, whom he had directed in the screwball comedy &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; (1934), but the cost of hiring Lombard in her new status as a freelancer proved to be far too expensive, and Columbia could not afford her. Katharine Hepburn, Claudette Colbert, Margaret Sullavan, Ginger Rogers, and Irene Dunne were offered the role, but turned it down. Dunne rejected the role because she felt the part was too small and needed to be expanded. Jean Arthur was suspended by the studio when she refused to take it. Joan Crawford reportedly was considered. Hawks then turned to Rosalind Russell, who had just finished MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Women&quot; (1939). Russell was upset when she discovered from a &quot;New York Times&quot; article that Cohn was &quot;stuck&quot; with her after attempting to cast many other actresses. Before Russell&#x27;s first meeting with Hawks, to show her apathy, she took a swim and entered his office with wet hair, causing him to do a &quot;triple take&quot;. Russell confronted him about this casting issue; he dismissed her quickly and asked her to go to wardrobe.

===Filming===

After makeup, wardrobe, and photography tests, filming began on 27 September 1939. The film had the working title of &quot;The Bigger They Are&quot;.

The film is noted for its rapid-fire repartee, using overlapping dialogue to make conversations sound more realistic, with one character speaking before another finishes. Although overlapping dialogue is specified and cued in the 1928 play script by Hecht and MacArthur, Hawks told Peter Bogdanovich:

To get the effect he wanted, as multi-track sound recording was not yet available at the time, Hawks had the sound mixer on the set turn the various overhead microphones on and off as required for the scene, as many as 35 times. Reportedly, the film was sped up because of a challenge Hawks took upon himself to break the record for the fastest dialogue on screen, at the time held by &quot;The Front Page&quot;. Hawks arranged a showing for newsmen of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his dialogue was.

Hawks gave the actors the freedom to improvise some of their lines and actions, as he did with his comedies more than his dramas. In her autobiography &quot;Life Is a Banquet&quot;, Russell wrote that she thought she did not have as many good lines as Grant, so she hired her own writer to &quot;punch up&quot; her dialogue. With Hawks encouraging ad-libbing, she was able to slip her writer&#x27;s work into the movie. Only Grant was wise to this tactic and greeted her each morning with &quot;What have you got today?&quot; Her ghostwriter gave her some of the lines for the restaurant scene, which is unique to &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;. It was one of the most complicated scenes to film; because of the rapidity of the dialogue the actors actually ate very little during the scene. Hawks shot this scene with one camera a week and a half into production, and it took four days to film instead of the intended two. The improvisations made it difficult for the cinematographers to know what the characters were going to do. Russell was also difficult to film because her lack of a sharp jawline required makeup artists to paint and blend a dark line under her jawline while shining a light on her face to simulate a more youthful appearance.

Hawks encouraged aggressiveness and unexpectedness in the acting, breaking the fourth wall a few times in the film. At one point, Grant broke character because of something unscripted that Russell did and looked directly at the camera, saying &quot;Is she going to do that?&quot; Hawks decided to leave this scene in, although it does not appear in the final cut.

Owing to the numerous ensemble scenes, many retakes were necessary. Having learned from &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938), Hawks added some straight supporting characters in order to balance out the leading characters.

Arthur Rosson worked for three days on second unit footage at Columbia Ranch.

Filming was completed on 21 November 1939, seven days past schedule.

Unusually for the time period, the film contains no music except for the music that leads to the final fade out of the film.

====Ad-libs by Grant====
Grant&#x27;s character describes Bellamy&#x27;s character by saying &quot;He looks like that fellow in the movies, you know ... Ralph Bellamy!&quot; According to Bellamy, the remark was ad-libbed by Grant. Columbia studio head Harry Cohn thought it was too cheeky and ordered it removed, but Hawks insisted that it stay. Grant makes several other &quot;inside&quot; remarks in the film. When his character is arrested for kidnapping, he describes the horrendous fate suffered by the last person who crossed him: Archie Leach (Grant&#x27;s birth name). Another line that people think is an inside remark is when Earl Williams attempts to get out of the rolltop desk he&#x27;s been hiding in, Grant says, &quot;Get back in there, you Mock Turtle.&quot; The line is a &quot;cleaned-up&quot; version of a line from the stage version of &quot;The Front Page&quot; (&quot;Get back in there, you God damned turtle!&quot;) and Grant also played &quot;The Mock Turtle&quot; in the 1933 film version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. Although Grant also might’ve been referencing an earlier line from the stage version, which is delivered in act one by Bensinger, (the owner of the infamous roll-top desk) in which he describes the condemned Williams’ last meal as: “…Mock turtle soup, chicken pot pie, hashed brown potatoes, combination salad, and pie a la mode.” 

==Release==

Release of the film was rushed by Cohn and a sneak preview of the film was held in December, with a press screening on January 3, 1940. &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; premiered in New York City at Radio City Music Hall on January 11, 1940, and went into general American release a week later.

== Reception ==

Contemporary reviews from critics were very positive. Critics were particularly impressed by the gender change of the reporter. Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;Except to add that we&#x27;ve seen &quot;The Front Page&quot; under its own name and others so often before we&#x27;ve grown a little tired of it, we don&#x27;t mind conceding &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; is a bold-faced reprint of what was once—and still remains—the maddest newspaper comedy of our times.&quot; The &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer wrote &quot;The trappings are different—even to the extent of making reporter Hildy Johnson a femme—but it is still &quot;Front Page&quot; and Columbia need not regret it. Charles Leder (sic) has done an excellent screenwriting job on it and producer-director Howard Hawks has made a film that can stand alone almost anywhere and grab healthy grosses.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote &quot;Even though the story and its development will be familiar to those who saw the first version of &quot;The Front Page&quot;, they will be entertained just the same, for the action is so exciting that it holds one in tense suspense throughout.&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; wrote &quot;Given a snappy pace, a top flight cast, good production and able direction, the film has all the necessary qualities for first-rate entertainment for any type of audience.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that after years of &quot;feeble, wispy, sad imitations&quot; of &quot;The Front Page&quot;, he found this authentic adaptation of the original to be &quot;as fresh and undated and bright a film as you could want&quot;. Louis Marcorelles called &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; &quot;le film américain par excellence&quot;.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 99% based on 100 reviews, with an average rating of 9.00/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Anchored by stellar performances from Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; is possibly the definitive screwball romantic comedy.&quot;

In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll of the greatest films of all time, &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; appeared on several lists, including those of critic David Thomson and director Quentin Tarantino.

==Interpretation and themes==

=== Story ===


The title &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; is an ironic title, because a girl &quot;Friday&quot; represents a servant of a master, but Hildy is not a servant in the film, but rather the equal to Walter. The world in this film is not determined by gender, but rather by intelligence and capability. At the beginning of the film, Hildy says that she wants to be &quot;treated like a woman&quot;, but her return to her profession reveals her true desire to live a different life. In &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, even though the characters remarry, Hawks displays an aversion to marriage, home, and family through his approach to the film. Specific, exclusionary camera work and character control of the frame and the dialogue portray a subtle criticism of domesticity. The subject of domesticity is fairly absent throughout the film. Even among the relationships between Grant and Russell and Bellamy and Russell, the relationships are positioned within a larger frame of the male-dominated newsroom. The film, like many comedies, celebrates difficult, tumultuous love rather than secure, suburban love through its preference for movement and argument rather than silent poise. Film critic Molly Haskell wrote that the scene near the end of the film when Hildy sheds tears was not included to expose her femininity, but to express the confusion she felt due to the collision of her professional and feminine natures. The feminine side of Hildy desires to be subservient and sexually desirable to men, while the other side of Hildy desires assertion and to forfeit the stereotypical duties of a woman. Her tears represent her emotional helplessness and inability to express anger to a male authority figure.

A commonality in many Howard Hawks films is the revelation of the amorality of the main character and a failure of that character to change or develop. In &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, Walter Burns manipulates, acts selfishly, frames his ex-wife&#x27;s fiancé, and orchestrates the kidnapping of an elderly woman. Even at the end of the film, Burns convinces Hildy Johnson to remarry him despite how much she loathes him and his questionable actions. Upon the resumption of their relationship, there is no romance visible between them. They do not kiss, embrace, or even gaze at each other. It is evident that Burns is still the same person he was in their previous relationship as he quickly waves off the plans for the honeymoon that they never had in pursuit of a new story. Additionally, he walks in front of her when exiting the room, forcing her to carry her own suitcase despite Johnson already having criticized this at the beginning of the film. This hints that the marriage is fated to face the same problems that ended it previously.

Hawks is known for his use of repeated or intentional gestures in his films. In &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, the cigarette in the scene between Hildy and Earl Williams serves several symbolic roles in the film. First, the cigarette establishes a link between the characters when Williams accepts the cigarette even though he does not smoke. However, the fact that he doesn&#x27;t smoke, and they don&#x27;t share the cigarette shows the difference between and separation of the worlds in which the two characters live.

The film contains two main plots: the personal and the professional. Walter induces Hildy to get back in the beat in the paper’s attempt to scoop the story of murderer Earl Williams; the concurrent plot is Walter attempting to scuttle Hildy’s upcoming marriage. The speed of the film results in snappy and overlapping dialogue among interruptions and rapid speech. Gesture, character and camera movement, as well as editing, serve to complement the dialogue in increasing the pace of the film. There is a clear contrast between the fast-talking Hildy and Walter and slow-talking Bruce and Earl. The average word per minute count of the film is 240 while the average American speech is around 140 words per minute. There are nine scenes with at least four words per second and at least two with more than five words per second. Hawks attached verbal tags before and after specific script lines so the actors would be able to interrupt and talk over each other without making the necessary dialogue incomprehensible.

Film theorist and historian David Bordwell explained the ending of &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; as a &quot;closure effect&quot; rather than a closure. The ending of the film is rather circular, and there is no development of characters, specifically Walter Burns, and the film ends similarly to the way in which it starts. Additionally, the film ends with a brief epilogue in which Walter announces their remarriage and reveals their intention to go cover a strike in Albany on the way to their honeymoon. The fates of the main characters and even some of the minor characters such as Earl Williams are revealed, although there are minor flaws in the resolution. For example, they do not discuss what happened to Mollie Malloy after the conflict is resolved. However, the main characters’ endings were wrapped up so neatly that it overshadows the need for the minor characters&#x27; endings to be wrapped up. This creates a &quot;closure effect&quot; or an appearance of closure.

=== Editing style ===


&quot;His Girl Friday&quot; is a movie intentioned for speed: it set the record on fastest words spoken per minute in a movie. A second to appreciate the moment is a foregone luxury in the whirlwind nature of the publishing business. Dissecting one of the scenes from the movie to best display the editing style, consider the specific scene where Earl Williams escapes. Howard Hawks emphasizes the pace difference between Hildy’s two possible lives, by having plot elements and staging mirror the editing, where slow and languid moments are interspersed with sub-second shots of newsworthy freneticism. To emphasize the contrast of rhythm between Hildy’s domestic life with Bruce versus her dynamic life with Walter, the director mirrors with editing techniques like lengthier contemplative shots versus rapid fire shots, matches on action versus elliptical shots with continuous diegetic sound, and scenes with one element of focus versus several different objects and sounds splitting our attention.

The scene opens with two lengthy (10 second) shots of Hildy describing her life outside the newsroom—the shots reinforce the idea that the life with Bruce will be predictable and slowly paced. As Hildy looks off away from the camera for the first time, literally turning her back on the newspaper life for just an instant, her attention is snapped back to the newsroom as shots are fired. Immediately, the editing reflects the newfound fast pace: from slow pans to static shots with the only movement being Hildy’s slow walking, the movie immediately shifts to dynamic shots with several people’s movements on the street, as well as gunshots, ducking, spotlight-exaggerated lighting shifts, and shouting with the men in the window. The medium shots of the frantic news reporters are in contrast with a now obscured long shot of Hildy—while previously she was the main character and source of sound, the director makes it clear that she will be suddenly relegated to the background when the action is happening: her background presence is obscured by a frosted window, and her sounds obscured by the frenzy of the gunshots and shouting.

Upon revealing that Earl Williams has escaped, the movie then shifts from multi-second shots to sub-second shots as the news editors enter maximum monkey mode. As gunshots provide a diegetic backdrop of time, ellipses shots become more obvious; the first reporter immediately cuts from reaching the table to talking on the phone. The next 5 shots are also sub-second close-ups of newsmen yelling into phones. As she is slowly drawn into this world again, Hildy begins to occupy more of the frame—going from a long shot to a medium shot as the newsmen stream past her. Once the men are gone, the longest shot of the sequence ensues: 16 seconds as she closes the distance she created from her old life, shedding her coat, symbolizing her chilly life in Albany, to reveal the reporter-ready dress underneath, the person she truly is. She fully reunites with it as she picks up the phone to talk to Walter, then rushes out of the room with the same fervor as the news folk. The camera cements this final switch as the dolly moves out, and a crossfade ensues on her running out, unlike all the prior cuts.

Finally it concludes using shots of gates opening, cars streaming out, and people running. Here, Hawks’ shots are not just fast—they are explicit about being faster than time. A diegetic siren delineates unit seconds as cars screech, but the film shows the abbreviated ellipses shot of the gate closing, skipping the time with a shot of guards running. This sequence is faster than real time, and the contrast with the siren shows how time in the news reporters world is faster paced than the world around them. Hildy joins the chaos shouting &quot;HEY!&quot;, providing a final contrast to the start of the scene where she described the idyllic and calm city life she was originally headed for.

Throughout this sequence, Hawks is explicit about the passage of time and focus of characters through his edits and mocks the slow Albany life Hildy begins with by showcasing the romantic frenzy of news life through shot timing, continuity of action, and shifting attention-grabbing elements.

=== Women reporters ===
According to Pauline Kael, all female reporters in newspaper films are based on Adela Rogers St. Johns.

==Legacy==
&quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (often along with &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; and &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;) is cited as an archetype of the screwball comedy genre. In 1993, the Library of Congress selected &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. The film ranked 19th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Laughs, a 2000 list of the funniest American comedies. Prior to &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, the play &quot;The Front Page&quot; had been adapted for the screen once before, in the 1931 film, also called &quot;The Front Page&quot;, produced by Howard Hughes, with Adolphe Menjou and Pat O&#x27;Brien in the starring roles. In this first film adaptation of the Broadway play of the same title (written by former Chicago newsmen Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur), Hildy Johnson was male.

&quot;His Girl Friday&quot; was dramatized as a one-hour radio play on the September 30, 1940, broadcast of &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, with Claudette Colbert, Fred MacMurray and Jack Carson. It was dramatized again with a half-hour version on &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; on March 30, 1941, with Grant and Russell reprising their film roles. &quot;The Front Page&quot; was remade in a 1974 Billy Wilder movie starring Walter Matthau as Walter Burns, Jack Lemmon as Hildy Johnson, and Susan Sarandon as his fiancée.

&quot;His Girl Friday&quot; and the original Hecht and MacArthur play were adapted into another stage play &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; by playwright John Guare. This was presented at the National Theatre in London from May to November 2003, with Alex Jennings as Burns and Zoë Wanamaker as Hildy. The 1988 film &quot;Switching Channels&quot; was loosely based on &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, with Burt Reynolds in the Walter Burns role, Kathleen Turner in the Hildy Johnson role, and Christopher Reeve in the role of Bruce. In December 2017 Peter Giser, the artistic director of the Snowglobe Theatre, an independent theatre based in Montreal, Canada, adapted the script for the stage, expanded some characters, and made the play more accessible to modern audiences. It was performed that December after Snowglobe obtained copyright status of this adapted version.

Director Quentin Tarantino has named &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; as one of his favorite movies. In the 2004 French film &quot;Notre musique&quot;, the film is used by Godard as he explains the basic of filmmaking, specifically the shot reverse shot. As he explains this concept, two stills from &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; are shown with Cary Grant in one photo and Rosalind Russell in the other. He explains that upon looking closely, the two shots are actually the same shot, &quot;because the director is incapable of seeing the difference between a man and a woman.&quot;

Rosalind Russell&#x27;s performance as Hildy Johnson was cited as the model for the character of Lois Lane in the Superman franchise.

<doc id="74026" wikidata="Q41847" url="?curid=74026" title="Romanos II">
<text>Romanos II (; 938 – 15 March 963) was Byzantine Emperor from 959 to 963. He succeeded his father Constantine VII at the age of twenty-one and died suddenly and mysteriously four years later. His wife Theophano helped their sons Basil II and Constantine VIII to ultimately succeed him in 976.

==Life==
Romanos II was a son of the Emperor Constantine VII and Helena Lekapene, the daughter of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos and his wife Theodora. The &quot;Theophanes Continuatus&quot; states that he was 21 years old at the time of his accession in 959, meaning that he was born in 938. Named after his maternal grandfather, Romanos was married, as a child, to Bertha, the illegitimate daughter of King Hugh of Italy, to bond an alliance. She had changed her name to Eudokia after their marriage, but died an early death in 949, which caused the dissolution of the alliance.

On 27 January 945, Constantine VII succeeded in removing his brothers-in-law, the sons of Romanos I, assuming the throne alone. On 6 April 945 (Easter), Constantine crowned his son co-emperor. With Hugh out of power in Italy and dead by 947, Romanos secured the promise from his father that he would be allowed to select his own bride. Romanos chose a woman named Anastaso, whom he married in 956 and renamed Theophano.

In November 959, Romanos II succeeded his father on the throne amidst rumors that he or his wife had poisoned him. Romanos purged his father&#x27;s courtiers of his enemies and replaced them with friends. To appease his bespelling wife, he excused his mother, Empress Helena, from court and forced his five sisters into convents. Nevertheless, many of Romanos&#x27; appointees were able men, including his chief adviser, the eunuch Joseph Bringas.

The pleasure-loving sovereign could also leave military matters in the adept hands of his generals, in particular the brothers Leo and Nikephoros Phokas. In 960 Nikephoros Phokas was sent to Crete with a fleet that was considered by contemporary historians as notably large, but probably not comprising more than 25,000-30,000 soldiers and sailors in total. After a difficult campaign and nine-month Siege of Chandax, Nikephoros successfully re-established Byzantine control over the entire island in 961. Following a triumph celebrated at Constantinople, Nikephoros was sent to the eastern frontier, where the Emir of Aleppo Sayf al-Dawla was engaged in annual raids into Byzantine Anatolia. Nikephoros took Cilicia and even Aleppo in 962, sacking the palace of the Emir and taking possession of his treasures. In the meantime Leo Phokas and Marianos Argyros had countered Magyar incursions into the Byzantine Balkans.

After a lengthy hunting expedition Romanos II took ill and died on 15 March 963. Rumor attributed his death to poison administered by his wife Theophano, but there is no evidence of this, and Theophano would have been risking much by exchanging the secure status of a crowned Augusta with the precarious one of a widowed regent of her very young children.

Romanos II&#x27;s reliance on his wife and on bureaucrats like Joseph Bringas had resulted in a relatively capable administration, but this built up resentment among the nobility, which was associated with the military. In the wake of Romanos&#x27; death, his Empress Dowager, now regent to the two co-emperors, her underage sons, was quick to marry the general Nikephoros Phokas and to acquire another general, John Tzimiskes, as her lover, having them both elevated to the imperial throne in succession. The rights of her sons were safeguarded, however, and eventually, when Tzimiskes died at war, her eldest son Basil II became senior emperor.

==Family==
Romanos&#x27; first marriage, in September 944, was to Bertha, illegitimate daughter of King Hugh of Italy. She changed her name from Bertha to Eudokia after her marriage. She died in 949, her marriage unconsummated.

By his second wife Theophano he had at least four children:
* Helena, born 955
* Basil II, born in 958
* Constantine VIII, born in 960
* Anna Porphyrogenita, born 13 March 963

<doc id="74028" wikidata="Q2625053" url="?curid=74028" title="The Hitch-Hiker">
<text>The Hitch-Hiker is a 1953 American independent film noir thriller co-written and directed by Ida Lupino, and starring Edmond O&#x27;Brien, William Talman and Frank Lovejoy. Based on the 1950 killing spree of Billy Cook, the film follows two friends who are taken hostage by a murderous hitchhiker during an automobile trip to Mexico.

&quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; was the first American mainstream film noir directed by a woman. It was selected in 1998 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
In the early 1950s, a hitchhiker robs and kills motorists who offer him rides. A suspect, Emmett Myers (Talman), is publicized in newspaper headlines.

In California, two friends, Roy Collins (O&#x27;Brien) and Gilbert Bowen (Lovejoy), are driving to a planned fishing trip in San Felipe, Baja California, Mexico. In Calexico, California, they pick up Myers, who pulls a gun and takes them hostage. Myers forces the pair to drive him to Santa Rosalía, Baja California Sur, where he plans to escape a police manhunt by taking a ferry across the Gulf of California to Guaymas. To avoid law enforcement, he orders them to stay off main roads and instead try to drive through the Baja California desert.

Collins and Bowen comply, hoping they will be identified and stopped at the Mexico–United States border at Mexicali, but to their dismay they are let through. In Mexico, Myers sadistically terrorizes the pair—at one point forcing Bowen to shoot a tin can out of Collins&#x27; hand from a long distance—and revels in the ineffective attempts by Mexican law enforcement to catch him using checkpoints. After a tense moment while stopping to get food, they stop for the night. Collins and Bowen discuss their plans to escape, and agree that they must act at the right time or they will be killed.

The next morning, the car radio fails, and Myers berates Collins for breaking it, so Bowen must drive. Meanwhile, police investigators learn the three are together and deduce where Myers is planning to go. At a gas station, Myers kills a dog, while Bowen leaves his wedding ring for the police to find. Overnight, Collins and Bowen attempt to escape, but Collins injures his ankle, and the pair are recaptured. As the police investigation proceeds, investigators release false information to trick Myers, which seems to work. Later, when the car is damaged, Myers forces the group to continue on foot at gunpoint, and taunts them for missing opportunities to escape even if it would mean the other would be killed.

Collins, Bowen, and Myers reach Santa Rosalía and head to a bar, where Myers tries to conceal his identity and find an English speaker. Learning the regular ferry to Guaymas has burned, Myers pays a fishing boat to take him there instead. However, as he prepares to leave with Collins and Bowen, a local resident recognizes Myers and alerts the authorities, who prepare to catch him at the pier. After a shootout and a scuffle, Myers is arrested and Collins and Bowen are freed unharmed.

==Background==
&quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; was based on the 1950 killing spree of Billy Cook who, posing as a hitchhiker, murdered a family of five, kidnapped a Riverside County Sheriff&#x27;s Department deputy and abandoned him in a desert (the deputy survived), and killed a traveling salesman, before attempting to flee to Mexico by taking two men on a hunting trip hostage and forcing them to drive him to Santa Rosalía. There, Cook was identified and apprehended by local police without incident. As Mexico then lacked a formal extradition treaty with the United States, Mexican authorities &quot;extradited&quot; him back to the U.S. by physically pushing him over the border, where he was taken into custody by waiting American law enforcement. Cook was tried, convicted, and received the death penalty. On December 12, 1952, Cook was executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison in California.

==Production==
The film was written by Lupino and her former husband Collier Young, based on a story by Daniel Mainwaring which was adapted by Robert L. Joseph. Mainwaring did not receive a screen credit due to his then being on the Hollywood blacklist.

&quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; went into production on June 24, 1952, and wrapped in late July. The director of photography was RKO Pictures regular Nicholas Musuraca. Location shooting took place in the Alabama Hills near Lone Pine and Big Pine, California. Working titles for the film were &quot;&quot;The Difference&quot; and &quot;The Persuader&quot;&quot;.

Lupino was a noted actress who began directing when Elmer Clifton got sick and couldn&#x27;t finish the film he was directing for Filmakers Inc., the production company founded by Lupino and her husband Collier Young to make low-budget, issue-oriented movies. Lupino stepped in to finish the film and went on to direct her own projects. &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; was her first hard-paced, fast-moving picture after four &quot;women&#x27;s&quot; films about social issues.

Lupino interviewed the two prospectors whom Billy Cook had held hostage, and got releases from them and from Cook as well, so that she could integrate parts of Cook&#x27;s life into the script. To appease the censors at the Hays Office, however, she reduced the number of deaths to three. &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; premiered in Boston on March 20, 1953, to little fanfare and immediately went into general release. The film was marketed with the tagline: &quot;When was the last time you invited death into your car?&quot;

The film is in the public domain.

==Reception==

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; said that &quot;with nothing more than three able actors, a lot of rugged scenery and their own impressive talents as producers, authors and director, Collier Young and Ida Lupino have brewed a grim little chiller&quot;. The &quot;Inquirer&quot; critic praised the performances and said the film was &quot;directed with masculine strength by the amazing Miss Lupino&quot;.

The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave the film three and a half of four stars, saying Lupino made &quot;good and exciting use&quot; of the real-life incident.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film an &quot;unrelenting but superficial study of abnormal psychology coupled with standard chase melodrama&quot;. Critic A. H. Weiler complimented the performances and Lupino&#x27;s &quot;brisk direction&quot;, but criticized the plot as excessively predictable.

&quot;The Detroit Free Press&quot; said that the film performed a public service by warning motorists about the dangers of picking up hitchhikers.

== Legacy ==
The film has been widely praised in the years since its release, and holds a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 43 reviews.

Critic John Krewson lauded the work of Ida Lupino, and wrote, As a screenwriter and director, Lupino had an eye for the emotional truth hidden within the taboo or mundane, making a series of B-styled pictures which featured sympathetic, honest portrayals of such controversial subjects as unmarried mothers, bigamy, and rape ... in &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot;, arguably Lupino&#x27;s best film and the only true noir directed by a woman, two utterly average middle-class American men are held at gunpoint and slowly psychologically broken by a serial killer. In addition to her critical but compassionate sensibility, Lupino had a great filmmaker&#x27;s eye, using the starkly beautiful street scenes in &quot;Not Wanted&quot; and the gorgeous, ever-present loneliness of empty highways in &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; to set her characters apart.

&quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot; wrote of the film, Absolutely assured in her creation of the bleak, noir atmosphere – whether in the claustrophobic confines of the car, or lost in the arid expanses of the desert – Lupino never relaxes the tension for one moment. Yet her emotional sensitivity is also upfront: charting the changes in the menaced men&#x27;s relationship as they bicker about how to deal with their captor, stressing that only through friendship can they survive. Taut, tough, and entirely without macho-glorification, it&#x27;s a gem, with first-class performances from its three protagonists, deftly characterised without resort to cliché.

In January 2014, a restored 35mm print was premiered by the Film Noir Foundation at Noir City 12 at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco. On April 6, 2014 &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; was shown again at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood. Mary Ann Anderson author of &quot;The Making of The Hitch-Hiker&quot; appeared at this event.

While most &quot;films noir&quot; were filmed in claustrophobic cities, &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; was filmed in the desert southwestern United States (territory similar to that of Baja California, where most of the story takes place), mostly in wilderness and small villages. Critics Bob Porfiero and Alain Silver, in a review and analysis of the film, praised Lupino&#x27;s use of shooting locations. They wrote, &quot;&quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot;″s desert locale, although not so graphically dark as a cityscape at night, isolates the protagonists in a milieu as uninviting and potentially deadly as any in &quot;film noir&quot;.&quot;

<text>Data terminal equipment (DTE) is an end instrument that converts user information into signals or reconverts received signals. It is also called data processing terminal equipment or tail circuit. A DTE device communicates with the data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE), such as a modem. The DTE/DCE classification was introduced by IBM.

A DTE is the functional unit of a data station (&quot;station&quot;, &quot;terminal&quot;) that serves as a data source or a data sink and provides for the data communication control function to be performed in accordance with the link protocol.

Usually, the DTE device is the terminal (or a computer emulating a terminal), and the DCE is a modem or another carrier-owned device. The data terminal equipment may be a single piece of equipment or an interconnected subsystem of multiple pieces of equipment that perform all the required functions necessary to permit users to communicate. A user interacts with the DTE (e.g. through a human-machine interface), or the DTE may be the user.

==Connections==
Two different types of devices are assumed on each end of the interconnecting cable for a case of simply adding DTE to the topology (e.g. to a hub, DCE), which also brings a less trivial case of interconnection of devices of the same type: DTE-DTE or DCE-DCE. Such cases need crossover cables, such as for the Ethernet or null modem for RS-232.

D-sub connectors follow another rule for pin assignment.
* 25 pin DTE devices transmit on pin 2 and receive on pin 3. 
* 25 pin DCE devices transmit on pin 3 and receive on pin 2.
* 9 pin DTE devices transmit on pin 3 and receive on pin 2. 
* 9 pin DCE devices transmit on pin 2 and receive on pin 3.

==Networking==
A general rule is that DCE devices provide the clock signal (internal clocking) and the DTE device synchronizes on the provided clock (external clocking).

This term is also generally used in the Telco and Cisco equipment context to designate a network device, such as terminals, personal computers but also routers and bridges, that&#x27;s unable or configured not to generate clock signals. Hence a direct PC to PC Ethernet connection can also be called a DTE to DTE communication. This communication is done via an Ethernet crossover cable as opposed to a PC to DCE (hub, switch, or bridge) communication which is done via an Ethernet straight cable.

V.35 is a high-speed serial interface designed to support both higher data rates and connectivity between DTEs (data-terminal equipment) or DCEs (data-communication equipment) over digital lines.

<doc id="74043" wikidata="Q1035128" url="?curid=74043" title="Captain Hook">
<text>Captain James Hook is the main antagonist of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s 1904 play &quot;Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot; and its various adaptations, in which he is Peter Pan&#x27;s archenemy. The character is a pirate captain of the brig &quot;Jolly Roger.&quot; His two principal fears are the sight of his own blood (supposedly an unnatural colour) and the crocodile who pursues him after having previously eaten Captain Hook&#x27;s hand cut off by Pan. An iron hook that replaced his severed hand has given the pirate his name.

==Creation of the character==
Hook did not appear in early drafts of the play, wherein the capricious and coercive Peter Pan was closest to a &quot;villain&quot;, but was created for a front-cloth scene (a cloth flown well downstage in front of which short scenes are played while big scene changes are &quot;silently&quot; carried out upstage) depicting the children&#x27;s journey home. Later, Barrie expanded the scene, on the premise that children were fascinated by pirates, and expanded the role of the captain as the play developed. The character was originally cast to be played by Dorothea Baird, the actress playing Mary Darling, but Gerald du Maurier, already playing George Darling (and the brother of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies), persuaded Barrie to let him take the additional role instead, a casting tradition since replicated in many stage and film productions of the Peter Pan story.

According to A. N. Wilson, Barrie &quot;openly acknowledged [that] Hook and his obsession with the crocodile was an English version of Ahab&quot;, and there are other borrowings from Melville.

==Biography of the character==
Barrie states in the novel that &quot;Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze&quot;. He is said to be &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s bo&#x27;sun&quot; and &quot;the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid&quot;. (In Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, one of the names Long John Silver goes by is &quot;Barbecue&quot;.)

In the play, it is implied that Hook attended Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, and his final words are &quot;Floreat Etona&quot;, Eton&#x27;s motto. In the novel, Hook&#x27;s last words are a similarly upper-class &quot;bad form&quot;, in disapproval of the way Peter Pan beats him by throwing him overboard. He also has a yellow blood disorder.

The book relates that Peter Pan began the ongoing rivalry between them by feeding the pirate&#x27;s hand to a crocodile. After getting a taste of Hook, the crocodile pursues him relentlessly, but the ticking clock it has also swallowed warns Hook of its presence.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Peter Pan&quot; (play) and &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot; (novel)===
Hook is described as &quot;cadaverous&quot; and &quot;blackavised&quot;, with &quot;eyes which were of the blue of the forget-me-not&quot; (&quot;save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly&quot;) and long dark curls resembling &quot;black candles&quot;. He is a very skilled swordsman. In many pantomime performances of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, Hook&#x27;s hair is a wig and is accompanied by thick bushy eyebrows and moustache. The hook is fixed to his right hand (often changed to the left hand in film adaptations) and is used as a weapon. He is also described as having a &quot;handsome countenance&quot; and an &quot;elegance of ... diction&quot; – &quot;even when he [is] swearing&quot;. Barrie describes &quot;an attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts&quot;. Hook&#x27;s cigar holder enables him to smoke two cigars at once. Barrie also stated in &quot;Captain Hook at Eton&quot; that he was, &quot;in a word, the handsomest man I have ever seen, though, at the same time, perhaps slightly disgusting&quot;. Although Hook is callous and bloodthirsty, it makes it clear that these qualities make him a magnificent pirate and &quot;not wholly unheroic&quot;.
=== version===

In the animated film &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953), Captain Hook is a far more comical villain than the original character: he is seen as a vain and dastardly coward with a childish temper who is prone to crying out in terror. During the film&#x27;s early development, the story department analysed Hook&#x27;s character as &quot;a fop... Yet very mean, to the point of being murderous. This combination of traits should cause plenty of amusement whenever he talks or acts&quot;.

Frank Thomas was the directing animator of Hook. According to Disney&#x27;s Platinum release bonus features, Hook was modeled after an English king. One director insisted that Hook should be a darker villain with no comedic traits; but this was refused for fear of frightening a juvenile audience, and Hook became a comical villain, equally matched with Peter Pan.

Actor Hans Conried set the tone and pathos for Disney&#x27;s interpretation of Hook, as he was the original voice for the Captain, as well as, in the tradition of the stage play, Mr. Darling, and performed live-action reference for the two characters. In subsequent Disney animation, Hook is voiced by Corey Burton.

Hook seeks revenge on Peter Pan for having fed the crocodile his left hand and refuses to leave Neverland prior to this revenge. Throughout the film, Hook is supported by Mr. Smee. After promising Tinker Bell not to lay a finger (or a hook) on Peter Pan, he plants a bomb in Peter&#x27;s hideout (instead of Barrie&#x27;s vial of poison). At the conclusion of the film, Hook is chased by the crocodile into the distance, with the rest of the crew trying to save Hook. Walt Disney insisted on keeping Hook alive, as he said: &quot;The audience will get to liking Hook, and they don&#x27;t want to see him killed.&quot;

====Other film appearances====
In the sequel &quot;Return to Never Land&quot; (2002), Hook mistakes Wendy&#x27;s daughter Jane for Wendy and uses her as bait to lure Peter Pan to his death. After this fails, he promises to take Jane home if she will help him find the island&#x27;s treasure, and &quot;not to harm a single hair on Peter Pan&#x27;s head&quot;. This last promise is kept when he pulls a single hair from Peter&#x27;s head, declaring &quot;the rest of him is mine&quot;. At the end of the film, he and the crew are pursued into the distance by a giant octopus. 

Captain Hook is one of the Disney Villains who have a main focus in the direct-to-video anthology film &quot;Once Upon a Halloween&quot;.

Captain Hook&#x27;s origins are explored in the Disney Fairies film &quot;The Pirate Fairy&quot;, in which he is voiced by Tom Hiddleston. In the story, a young James years before he lost his hand, pretended to be a pirate ship&#x27;s cabin boy and befriended a rebellious fairy Zarina who had left Pixie Hollow after being dismissed as a dust-keeper when her unauthorised experiments with pixie dust led to a disaster. James foresaw the great potential of the pixie dust and let Zarina think she had the authority over pirates.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; short film &quot;Welcome to the Club&quot;, Captain Hook (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) appears along with other Disney Villains trying to convince Lisa Simpson how fun it is to be a villain. He also appears in the short film &quot;The Most Wonderful Time of the Year&quot;.

Jude Law portrays Captain Hook in Disney&#x27;s live-action film &quot;Peter Pan &amp; Wendy&quot;, which loosely adapts material from the 1953 animated film. Unlike the animated version, his hook is his right arm. Unlike Barrie&#x27;s original play and later &quot;Peter Pan&quot; adaptations, in which the same actor play Hook and Mr. Darling, the latter&#x27;s role is performed by a different actor, Alan Tudyk. In this version, Hook is revealed to be an old friend of Peter&#x27;s and the first Lost Boy, but he left Neverland because he missed his mother. Years later, he returned to Neverland as a pirate, being rejected by Peter because he had grown up.

Joshua Colley plays a teen Hook in the live-action film &quot;&quot;, from the &quot;Descendants&quot; franchise. His teenage son Harry (portrayed by Thomas Doherty) appears in the previous films of the franchise &quot;Descendants 2&quot; and &quot;Descendants 3&quot;, Captain Hook being only mentioned.

====Television series====
Captain Hook made a special guest cameo on &quot;Raw Toonage&quot; in the episode hosted by Don Karnage (air pirate of &quot;TaleSpin&quot;), wherein he challenged Karnage to a sword fight for a treasure chest and won.

Hook also appeared frequently on &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, and its two direct-to-video films &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse&quot; and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s House of Villains&quot;, being one of the main villains in the last one.

In the Disney Junior series &quot;Jake and the Never Land Pirates&quot;, Hook serves as the main antagonist, with his mother, Mama Hook, herself exclusive to the Disney Junior series, keeping him &quot;honest&quot; if he gets tempted.

====Video games====
=====&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series=====
 appears in the Action/RPG game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, in cooperation with Maleficent and other villains. He uses his pirate ship to travel between worlds. His Japanese voice actor was Chikao Ōhtsuka up until &quot;Birth by Sleep&quot;, where Chikao Ōhtsuka was cast as Master Xehanort and Hook thus voiced by Naoya Uchida. His English voice actor is Corey Burton.

He takes Riku along with him, where Kairi is being held. Hook does not like Riku&#x27;s bossiness and regrets taking him along; nonetheless, he follows his orders, as Riku now has control over the Heartless and would most likely unleash them on him should he disobey. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy arrive in Neverland, Riku throws them in the hold where they meet and escape with Peter Pan, who is searching for his friend Wendy. Captain Hook believed that Wendy was a &quot;Princess of Heart&quot; and that is why he captured her. However, Riku reports to him from Maleficent that Wendy is not a Princess of heart at all, irritating Hook (he hints that kidnapping Wendy was a very difficult task). After defeating the Heartless below deck, Sora fights a copy of himself summoned by Riku in Hook&#x27;s office. After confronting Hook on the deck, learning that Riku took Kairi to Hollow Bastion, Sora and company are forced to surrender when Hook uses Tinker Bell as a hostage. When the crocodile appears, Hook flees to his office while telling Smee to have their prisoners walk the plank. However, Peter Pan returns to save Sora before imitating Smee to trick Hook out to the deck, resulting in the villain being thrown overboard and chased into the horizon by the crocodile.

In &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot; he appears as a figment of Sora&#x27;s memories. He later reappears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot;, finding a large number of treasure maps all leading to boxes that are actually set to release Heartless once Hook opens the chest (unknown to Hook and Smee, however, is that these chests were set up to help build Pete&#x27;s Heartless army). Hook later appears in the game series prequel, &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot;, where he tricks Terra into attempting to kill Peter Pan for him. He later kidnaps Tinker Bell and takes Mickey Mouse&#x27;s star fragment, but is defeated by Ventus and thrown into the water, where the crocodile chases him off.

=====&quot;Epic Mickey&quot;=====
An animatronic version of Captain Hook is also featured prominently in the Wii game &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;, wherein he has been converting his crew into animatronic, cyborg version of themselves (referred to in the game as Beetleworx) and is waging an attack against the non-converted pirates. Smee requests that Mickey Mouse find a way to save Hook and stop this machine that is turning pirates into Beetleworx. Players can either fight Hook by themselves and earn a thinner upgrade (and a &quot;bad ending&quot;) or free the Sprite and have Pete Pan (a version of Pete dressed up as Peter Pan) defeat him and earn a paint upgrade (and a &quot;good ending&quot; showing Pete Pan and Captain Hook in a duel). In &quot;Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two&quot;, Hook has disappeared entirely, leaving his crew leaderless and having been run out of Tortooga by Blackbeard and Pete Pan having joined up with the Mad Doctor after losing his purpose. Some of Hook&#x27;s clothes and items have been left behind in Ventureland, which the crew members seek to assert their authority to take over leadership of the other pirates and lead them to take back their home.

The Cartoon World&#x27;s version of Hook appears in &quot;Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion&quot; as the first boss, having fallen under the control of Mizrabel to fight Mickey. Upon his defeat, he comes to his senses and offers his help to Mickey&#x27;s quest to bring the toons back to the Cartoon World.

====Attractions and live events====

Captain Hook appears at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts as a meetable character along with Mr. Smee in Adventureland. He also appears as a figure during the dark ride &quot;Peter Pan&#x27;s Flight&quot;.

In &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; at Disneyland, there is a scene in which we see Captain Hook and Peter Pan duelling aboard the Jolly Roger (portrayed by the Sailing Ship &quot;Columbia&quot;). This is replaced by a short re-enactment of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pocahontas&quot; at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios.

At Disney World&#x27;s &quot;Dream-Along with Mickey&quot; show, Hook, along with Smee, is one of the villains that crashes Mickey&#x27;s party. This happens when Peter and Wendy appear to make Goofy&#x27;s dream for some adventure come true and play a game of &quot;Pretend to Be Pirates&quot; with Donald Duck, who pretends to be the captain until the real Hook appears and challenges Peter to a duel. At first, Hook&#x27;s appearance seems to take place for no reason other than to add some action to the show but is revealed to actually be working for Maleficent, who is insulted after not being invited to the party. He is defeated by Mickey Mouse, who leads the audience in a chant of &quot;Dreams come true!&quot;, and scares off the villains.

At the Disney Villains Mix and Mingle Halloween Dance Party at &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party&quot;, Hook is summoned up by Maleficent along with the other villains, and co-hosts along with her, revealed by him being the only one of the villains besides her to sing and also being the villain that dances with her.

Captain Hook was also featured in the &quot;Disney on Ice&quot; 2013 show &#x27;Let&#x27;s Party&#x27; as part of the Halloween celebration section, which takes the format of a party hosted by Jack Skellington where all the &#x27;main&#x27; Disney villains attend (Evil Queen and Jafar being two other notable villains in the scene) and they plan to capture Mickey Mouse to plunge everyone into unhappiness.

====Printed media====
Occasionally, Hook appears in the Scrooge McDuck universe of comic books as the nemesis of Moby Duck, a whaler cousin of Donald Duck.

In the &quot;Kingdom Keepers&quot; series book &quot;Disney at Dawn&quot; (2008), Captain Hook was snooping around Ariel&#x27;s Grotto, having been sent by the Overtakers in investigate the meaning in Jess playing songs over the park speakers.

In the &quot;Descendants&quot; franchise novels &quot;Isle of the Lost&quot; (2015) and its sequel &quot;Rise of the Isle of the Lost&quot; (2017), Captain Hook appears as one of the villains who live imprisoned on the titular island. He is also the father of Harriet (eldest daughter), Harry (middle son), and CJ (youngest daughter).

In the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; novel &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom&quot; by A. C. Crispin, Captain Hook is mentioned as &quot;James&quot; in conversation, confirmed by Crispin to be a Disney &quot;in&quot; joke.

===In film===
====&quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1924 film)====

In the 1924 silent film &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, Captain Hook is portrayed by Ernest Torrence.

====&quot;Hook&quot; (1991 film)====
Captain James Hook is played by Dustin Hoffman in &quot;Hook&quot;. Looking for purpose in his own life Hook kidnaps the children of the adult Peter to lure his arch-enemy back to Neverland and gives the middle-aged man three days to rekindle his spirit. Hook has been left feeling depressed and suicidal since Peter Pan forfeited his eternal youth and left Neverland to start a family with Wendy&#x27;s granddaughter Moira and took on the new identity of Peter Banning (Robin Williams). After his initial arrival in Neverland, Banning make an unsuccessful first attempt to get Hook to release his children by offering money but Hook refuses, shooting Peter&#x27;s checkbook. Hook worries he has nothing left to accomplish; he has long since killed the crocodile and made a quiet clock tower out of its corpse. Despite killing the crocodile, he remains terrified of the sound of ticking clocks and has become increasingly paranoid of the crocodile coming back, often destroying clocks to cope. At Smee&#x27;s suggestion, Hook attempts to persuade Peter&#x27;s children that their father never loved them, in order to coerce them to stay in Neverland. He is successful with Jack, Peter&#x27;s son, who soon sees Hook as the attentive father figure that Peter has never been, and Hook eventually sees Jack as a potential heir. Peter&#x27;s daughter, Maggie, mistrusts Hook immediately and refuses to be swayed, reminding Hook of her father&#x27;s past defiances. Hook decides to hold Maggie hostage until Peter&#x27;s failure to rescue her ruins her faith in him. This backfires when Peter and the Lost Boys rescue her immediately. Jack sees Hook stab Rufio to death in a duel and realises how much his father cares for the Lost Boys, rejecting the murderous Hook and embracing Peter once again. As Peter leaves the ship with his children and the Lost Boys, Hook orders him to come back. Maggie tells him off, stating Hook needs a mother to straighten his bad attitude. After Hook vows to kidnap future generations of children in Peter&#x27;s family, Peter and Hook engage in a final duel amidst a circle of Lost Boys, Peter taunting Hook about the idea that the ticking clocks he fears are not reminders of the crocodile, but a reminder of time ticking away. After a close call where Tinker Bell deflects an attack with the hook, the crocodile clock tower seemingly comes to &quot;life&quot; and eats Hook when it falls on top of him.

Hook&#x27;s missing hand is his left and his stump takes other attachments, including a baseball mitt and a pointer. He dresses very elegantly in a gold-trimmed red coat, matching hat, and a wig that hides his balding head. He wears a ceremonial captain&#x27;s sword at his side, but uses a proper duelling sword when fighting Rufio and Peter. Hook&#x27;s physical appearance in the film is heavily influenced by Disney&#x27;s portrayal, though with more elaborate clothing trim and his moustache is curled, shaped like a hook. He is closer to Barrie&#x27;s characterisation as a gentleman pirate than in Disney&#x27;s version; for instance, he frequently describes certain behaviours as &quot;good form&quot; or &quot;bad form&quot; (although he is willing to violate these rules when it suits him, such as trying to stab Peter in the back during their climatic duel). Hoffman claimed to have based the character&#x27;s voice and mannerisms on conservative columnist William F. Buckley Jr.

In addition to playing the titular character, as a reference to the traditional element of casting one actor in a dual-role of Captain Hook and George Darling in the original play, Hoffman also provided the airline pilot&#x27;s announcement in the scene where the Bannings fly from San Francisco to London for Christmas.

====&quot;Peter Pan&quot; (2003 film)====
In the 2003 film adaptation of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, Captain Hook is portrayed by English actor Jason Isaacs, who also plays the role of George Darling, Wendy&#x27;s father, following the tradition of the original play. Isaacs correctly wears the hook on his right hand, supported by a shoulder harness. The character also features a tattoo of Eton&#x27;s coat of arms on his left shoulder. Hook is feared and ruthless, but also gentlemanly. In the climactic duel, he learns to fly, almost defeating Peter Pan, but the Lost Boys&#x27; taunts weaken the enthusiasm needed to fly, and he falls into the crocodile&#x27;s mouth, accepting his fate.

====&quot;Shrek&quot; film series====

Captain Hook is a minor character in the film &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, playing &quot;Little Drop of Poison&quot; by Tom Waits and &quot;People Just Ain&#x27;t No Good&quot; by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds on the piano in the &quot;Poisoned Apple&quot; tavern. In &quot;Shrek the Third&quot;, he has a greater role as a secondary villain and is voiced by Ian McShane.

====&quot;Finding Neverland&quot;====
During the film &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;, a biopic about Peter Pan&#x27;s creator James Matthew Barrie, James finds inspiration for the character of Captain Hook from Sylvia&#x27;s strict mother as she is holding a coat hanger to one of Sylvia&#x27;s boys. James envisions the hook in place of the left hand.

====&quot;Pan&quot; (2015 film)====

In this prequel to &quot;Peter Pan&quot; stories, Garrett Hedlund portrays a younger James Hook, one of the main protagonists, who teams up with Peter Pan to escape from Blackbeard&#x27;s mines in Neverland and joins forces with the native tribe. Although initially only interested in leaving Neverland, Hook is attracted to Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara) and assists her and Peter in personally dueling Boatswain Bishop as Tiger Lily fights Blackbeard during the final confrontation in the fairy kingdom. At the film&#x27;s conclusion, he joins Peter and Tiger Lily in rescuing other children including Peter&#x27;s confidant Nibs from Peter&#x27;s old orphanage back in London. Hook in this film is different from the original character, and is portrayed as a pioneer-era American without any connection with Eton, Blackbeard, or piracy in general.

====&quot;Come Away&quot;====

The character is played by David Gyasi in the 2020 film &quot;Come Away&quot; as CJ (a reference to &quot;Captain James&quot;), a ruthless pawnbroker and lower crime lord who is also the son of the Mad Hatter, the paternal grandfather of Alice and Peter Pan, making CJ their paternal uncle and the paternal great-uncle of the Darling children, Wendy, Michael and John through Alice (who grows up to marry George Darling and have the Darling siblings). CJ takes care of his father who is showing senility and thus only recognizes Jack; Alice and Peter&#x27;s father as his son who CJ has always resented having grown up in his older brother&#x27;s shadow. He also seems to blame Jack for the death of David who CJ seemed to view as his favorite nephew, so when Jack comes to his brother to help call off various debt collectors, CJ showing loyalty to his crime lord superiors crushes Jack&#x27;s right hand leaving it to be amputated. Peter in response seeks out a group of street urchins to then rob his uncle of the gold coins he&#x27;s safe guarding for the various criminal underworld factions before cutting off CJ&#x27;s left hand in a sword duel (when CJ catches them in the act) before fleeing to parts unknown pursued by CJ and his cohorts.

====&quot;Wendy&quot;====

The character is played by Kevin Pugh in the 2020 film &quot;Wendy&quot; in this contemporary re-telling film with Gavin Naquin as his younger self. Wendy here is the youngest to two twin older brothers James and Douglas, who are taken to Neverland by Peter, who here is made ageless after a deity saved him from a disaster that killed his family by sharing her powers with him making him untouched by time. This deity who is known as &quot;mother&quot; stops the kids who dwell there from growing up provided they retain faith in her otherwise she lets them rapidly ages into middle age adults. When Douglas seems to drown James starts losing faith, finding his right hand start to age prematurely prompting Peter to amputate it, but despite this James continues to grow old and rallies the other adults to kill and consume &quot;mother&quot; in an effort to retain their lost youth with a restored fishing boat. When Wendy discovers Douglas survived from seemingly drowning both help Peter revive &quot;mother&quot; after she is harpooned and temporary dies. James now with a makeshift hook in place of his right hand can no longer return home with his siblings and their friends, so stays to play with Peter as his new “enemy” Captain Hook, thereby allowing him to live out the rest of his days with the spirit of a child.

====&quot;Lost Girls&quot;====
Iain Glen plays Hook in the 2022 film &quot;The Lost Girls&quot;.

====&quot;Peter Pan&#x27;s Neverland Nightmare&quot;====
Hook is played by Charity Kase in the 2025 Twisted Childhood Universe film &quot;Peter Pan&#x27;s Neverland Nightmare&quot;.

===In television===
====&quot;Peter Pan (1976 musical)&quot;====
Hook was played by Danny Kaye in the 1976 &quot;Peter Pan&quot; TV musical.

====&quot;Peter Pan – The Animated Series (no boken)&quot;====
In 1989, the Japanese Nippon Animation produced 41 episodes of &quot;Peter Pan – the Animated Series&quot;, aired on World Masterpiece Theater and in several other countries. Hook&#x27;s personality was far closer to the original character from Barrie&#x27;s novel. Apart from wanting to destroy Pan, he is also eager to become Neverland&#x27;s first king. Hook has a second hook-hand that both looked and functioned like a crab claw.

He is voiced by Chikao Ōhtsuka, who also portrayed the Disney incarnation of the character in Japanese media, particularly in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; games.

====&quot;Peter Pan and the Pirates&quot;====
In 1990, Fox produced the television series &quot;Peter Pan and the Pirates&quot;, wherein Hook&#x27;s costume was more early 18th century rather than the classic Charles II-Restoration period. He had white hair and wore black clothes. He was also clean-shaven, without a moustache. Hook&#x27;s personality is closer to Barrie&#x27;s original character: he terrifies his crew, brutalises his enemies, has no fear (except the crocodile), shows great intelligence, and is passionate about William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. He was voiced by Tim Curry, who won an Emmy for this part.

====&quot;The Children&#x27;s Party at the Palace&quot;====
Hook is played by Anthony Head in the 2006 BBC TV special &quot;The Children&#x27;s Party at the Palace&quot;.

====&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;====

Captain Hook appears as a regular character in the TV series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;. He made his first appearance in the second-season episode &quot;The Crocodile&quot;. The character is played by Colin O&#x27;Donoghue.

Hook is born Killian Jones, who becomes captain of the Jolly Roger after his brother&#x27;s death. His hand is cut off by the dark trickster Rumpelstiltskin as revenge for Hook running away with his wife. In order to find a way to kill Rumplestiltskin, Hook travels to Neverland, where he spends over 100 years before escaping back to the Enchanted Forest. Hook teams up with Cora, the Queen of Hearts, and they travel to the Land Without Magic after the curse is broken.

====&quot;Neverland&quot; (TV miniseries)====

In the TV miniseries &quot;Neverland&quot;, James Hook is played by Rhys Ifans. He is introduced as &quot;Jimmy&quot;, a fencing teacher and leader of a small group of juvenile pickpockets including Peter Pan with whom he has developed a father-son relationship (that over time shatters completely due to events in Neverland culminating in the demise of Peter&#x27;s confidant). Jimmy is seeking a mysterious orb, which Peter and his gang have discovered unbeknownst to him. In the course of the miniseries, &quot;Jimmy&quot; in avertedly causes Peter&#x27;s right hand boy to die, where it is then revealed that &quot;Jimmy&quot; actually killed Peter&#x27;s father because he was in love with Peter&#x27;s mother, with the watch that Hook owns having once belonged to Peter&#x27;s father; the watch is lost with Hook&#x27;s hand in their final confrontation when the crocodile swallows both.

====&quot;Peter Pan Live!&quot; (2014 TV special)====
Christopher Walken plays Captain Hook in the musical production &quot;Peter Pan Live!&quot; which was broadcast live by NBC in December 2014. Compared to the 1954 musical on which it was based, this show sought to &quot;strengthen and deepen&quot; the portrayal of Captain Hook. Hook and his pirate crew perform songs from the original musical, such as &quot;Hook&#x27;s Tango&quot;, in addition to new songs such as &quot;Vengeance&quot; and &quot;Only Pretend&quot;.

====&quot;Peter and Wendy&quot; (2015 TV film)====

In the ITV film &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot;, he is played by Stanley Tucci. Who in real life is a prominent surgeon Dr. Wylie at Great Ormond Street Hospital that child patient Lucy Rose played by Hazel Doupe imagines is Hook with his surgical team as his pirates after she slips into a fantasy world that resembles Neverland following a near death experience during her life saving heart operation. Hook here is shown to be just as being somewhat equally naïve as Peter Pan; since this disliking of children is due to his own somewhat turbulent childhood; where he was sent away to Eton by an unloving family so therefore in some ways he needs Wendy as much as Peter. He even reads out aloud to crewmembers his recounts of his hated school days but still refuses to believe his family didn&#x27;t love him. He is shown to punish his crew for the slightest infractions killing one for accidentally spitting on his boots. Culminating in an ending similar to the book, only this time the crocodile drags him through an opening after bursting through the bottom hull to seize him, with said hook breaking off while James uses it to cling to the side of the hull.

===In literature===
====&quot;Peter Pan in Scarlet&quot;====
Geraldine McCaughrean&#x27;s authorized sequel to &quot;Peter Pan&quot; gives Peter a new nemesis, while bringing back the old favourite.

Ravello, a circus man in a constantly ragged woollen coat, volunteers to become Peter&#x27;s valet in the search for the treasure. Ravello provides a red coat (that formerly belonged to Hook) and a bad influence, influencing Peter increasingly to become more and more like Captain Hook. He sees himself not as a living person; he never sleeps and eats only eggs. He is revealed in the middle of the book to be the old James Hook, who escaped the crocodile when the animal&#x27;s stomach contractions broke the vial of poison Hook kept with him at all times. The poison killed the crocodile, and Hook used his hook to claw his way out, but he was mutated by the stomach acid into an uglier man with a scarred visage—vastly different in appearance from the noble pirate. He then assumed a new identity of Ravello, owner of a travelling circus, complete with lions, tigers, and bears.

A clue to Ravello&#x27;s true identity is given when one of the Lost Boys asks Ravello his name: he thinks for a while as if trying to remember, and finally says the name his mother gave him was Crichton, but that names given by mothers don&#x27;t mean anything.

One of Ravello&#x27;s trophies is an Eton trophy dated 1894. If Hook was 18—the last year of an Etonian—in that year, then he was born in 1876, a full one hundred and one years after his appearance at The Pirates&#x27; Conference, and even further after the times of Blackbeard and Long John Silver. It must also be said that Hook in this book denies that he was ever with Blackbeard, claiming that he would never have served such an uneducated man and that all such suggestions are merely rumours started by his enemies. Only upon receiving Wendy&#x27;s kiss, and five weeks&#x27; worth of sleep, does the real James Hook again reveal himself.

====&quot;Capt. Hook: The Adventures of a Notorious Youth&quot;====
According to the (2007 non-canon) novel &quot;Capt. Hook: The Adventures of a Notorious Youth&quot;, Captain Hook was the illegitimate son of a nobleman, &quot;Lord B&quot;, and an unnamed woman Hook has never met (implied to be the Queen). Disowned by Lord B., James Matthew is reared by a Shakespearean actress he calls Aunt Emily, and unwillingly attends Eton College as an Oppidan scholar, where he is an avid reader of Shakespeare and Shelley, and his motto is &quot;Knowledge is Power&quot;. He describes many things as first-rate – &quot;Topping Swank&quot;, and punctuates his sentences with &quot;The End&quot;. He is very interested in the French Revolution.

In the novel, James has only a few friends including Roger Peter Davies, whom he nicknames &quot;Jolly Roger&quot; (the name of his ship in later life), and the spider &quot;Electra&quot;. A seventeen-year-old Colleger, Arthur Darling (named after Arthur Llewelyn Davies) is his rival in studies, fencing, sports, and the attentions of the visiting Ottoman Sultana Ananova Ariadne. When James successfully woos Ananova, their affection sets off political outrage that affects the noble position of Lord B., who arranges for James to leave Eton on his trading ship, the &quot;Sea Witch&quot;. Upon leaving, James defeats Arthur in a final duel and burns his own school records to leave no traces of his behaviour. On the &quot;Sea Witch&quot;, he befriends boatswain Bartholomew Quigley Smeethington, generally called Smee, frees the slaves aboard ship, overthrows the ship&#x27;s captain (killed by Electra), and murders the quartermaster with a metal hook.

Throughout &quot;Capt. Hook&quot;, author J.V. Hart relates events in James Matthew Barrie&#x27;s life and the lives of the Llewellyn Davies children. The narrative expands upon details of Barrie&#x27;s original play and novel but ascribes James&#x27;s unusual colouring and yellow blood to a blood disorder, makes James&#x27;s long dark hair natural, rather than the usual wig, and has James titled &quot;Hook&quot; after murdering the quartermaster of the &quot;Sea Witch&quot;, rather than in reference to his prosthetic hand.

====&quot;Peter and the Starcatchers&quot;====
In the novel &quot;Peter and the Starcatchers&quot; by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson, Captain Hook is distinguished by halitosis, beady black eyes, a pock-marked face, and perpetual filth of his person and surroundings contrasting strongly with J. M. Barrie&#x27;s Etonian gentleman. The novel, which takes place before the Captain meets Peter Pan, calls Hook &quot;Black Stache&quot; for his prominent moustache, and his ship is called the &quot;Sea Devil&quot;; he captures the &quot;Jolly Roger&quot;, originally a British ship called the &quot;Wasp&quot;, later. Black Stache is renamed &quot;Captain Hook&quot; in the second instalment, &quot;Peter and the Shadow Thieves&quot;. In Barry and Pearson&#x27;s book, his left hand is accidentally cut off by Peter.

In Rick Ellis&#x27; theatrical adaptation of the Barry-Pearson novel, Black Stache (portrayed in the original production by Christian Borle, who won a Tony Award for the role) is a witty, poetical, but psychotic pirate prone to malapropisms and the occasional pratfall. Similar to the Disney film character, Black Stache resembles both a dangerous villain and a comic buffoon. The last of a line of villains, he seeks to become a great villain by fighting a great hero, and finds one in Peter. His hand is cut off not by Peter, but accidentally severed when he slams the lid of a trunk in a fit of rage.

====&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;====
One of conceptual consultant James Ward Byrkit&#x27;s concept art for the 2007 film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; showed a pirate similar to Captain Hook as one of the Pirate Lords of the Brethren Court.

In A. C. Crispin&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom&quot;, during a conversation between Captain Teague and Pirate Lord Don Rafael: &quot;You&#x27;ll never guess who I encountered at Oporto a few months ago. [...] James. [...] He&#x27;s lost a hand. [...] he said it wasn&#x27;t so bad, the hook was as good as a dagger in a fight. [...] He didn&#x27;t look a day older, not a day. [...] James was a lot more...subdued. [...] The taberna keeper&#x27;s little lad came round to collect our plates, and when he turned and saw he, for just a second he looked—scared. No, worse than that. Terrified. [...] Can you imagine that? Afraid! Of a young boy!&quot; It was confirmed by the author Crispin that &quot;James&quot; is indeed Captain Hook from J.M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. Crispin figured that since the &quot;Pirates&quot; franchise had a couple Disney &quot;in&quot; jokes (such as Gillette&#x27;s comment about &quot;a little mermaid&quot; in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;), that she&#x27;d include the mention of &quot;James&quot; as a joke.

===In theatre===
====&quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1950 musical)====
In Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s musical version, Boris Karloff starred as Mr. Darling/Captain Hook and Jean Arthur played Peter.

====&quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1954 musical)====

Kelsey Grammer originated the role in the Broadway cast and replacements for the role in the production include Anthony Warlow, Terrence Mann, and Marc Kudisch. Tom Hewitt played the role in the first US national tour.

===Other===
====2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony====

<text>Mickey Mouse Works (also known as Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse Works or simply Mouse Works) is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation featuring Mickey Mouse and his friends in a series of animated shorts. The first Disney television animated series to be produced in widescreen high definition, it is formatted as a variety show, with skits starring Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy, Pluto and Ludwig Von Drake while Horace Horsecollar, Clarabelle Cow, Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse, Huey, Dewey and Louie, Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale, Scrooge McDuck, Pete, Humphrey the Bear, J. Audubon Woodlore, Dinah the Dachshund, Butch the Bulldog, Mortimer Mouse, José Carioca, and Clara Cluck appear as supporting or minor characters. Musical themes for each character were composed by Stephen James Taylor with a live 12-piece band and extensive use of the fretless guitar to which the music of the series was nominated for an Annie Award in both 1999 and 2001. Most of the shorts from the series were later used in &quot;House of Mouse&quot;.

==Overview==
As Mickey Mouse&#x27;s first revival series, &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; was produced to recreate the golden age of Disney&#x27;s animated shorts featuring Disney&#x27;s most popular characters. By using basic colors and the original sound effects, effort was put forth to capture the look and feel of &quot;classic&quot; Disney.

Each half-hour episode consisted of various short cartoons that fell into three general types: 90-second gag cartoons, 7-and-a-half-minute character cartoons, and 12-minute &quot;Mouse Tales&quot; based on famous stories. The character-based segments also included &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;, carrying on the tradition of that series of theatrical shorts.

The gag shorts, which lasted 90 seconds each, were shown with the following umbrella titles:
* Mickey to the Rescue: Mickey tries to rescue Minnie from Pete&#x27;s trap-laden hideout.
* Maestro Minnie: Minnie conducts an orchestra of anthropomorphic rebellious musical instruments.
* Goofy&#x27;s Extreme Sports: Goofy shows off extreme sports in the words of his off-screen narrator.
* Donald&#x27;s Dynamite: Donald&#x27;s activity is interrupted by the appearance of a well-placed bomb.
* Von Drake&#x27;s House of Genius: Ludwig Von Drake shows off an invention of his which goes haywire.
* Pluto Gets the Paper: Pluto goes through a bit of problems trying to fetch the newspaper for Mickey.

With no established schedule or routine, &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; was designed to look like one spontaneous flow. Adding to that feeling were the show&#x27;s opening credits which ended differently each week, the only constant being an elaborate interruption from a spotlight-stealing Donald Duck.

While most skits involved individual characters, some have Mickey, Donald and Goofy running a special service group. Most Goofy skits have him doing a &quot;how-to&quot; segment always accompanied by a narrator. Most Donald segments were about him trying to accomplish a certain task which never works out right, frustrating him.

==Characters==
===Main===
* Mickey Mouse (voiced by Wayne Allwine, Quinton Flynn in &quot;Minnie Takes Care of Pluto&quot;) is the main protagonist of the series, he gets himself entangled in many farcical situations due to his guilelessness but is overall a calm character.
* Minnie Mouse (voiced by Russi Taylor) is Mickey&#x27;s girlfriend; like how Donald gets frustrated, Minnie is often peeved by Mickey&#x27;s impulsiveness and Daisy&#x27;s loudmouth, though she is mature for her age.
* Donald Duck (voiced by Tony Anselmo) is one of Mickey&#x27;s friends; he is well known for his hot temper, which often lashes out by impatience and self-righteousness.
* Goofy (voiced by Bill Farmer) is one of Mickey&#x27;s friends; he isn&#x27;t the smartest character on the show, as his idiocy usually irritates his friends.
* Daisy Duck (voiced by Diane Michelle in season 1 and Tress MacNeille in season 2) is Donald&#x27;s girlfriend; though they both have quick-tempers, Daisy is shown to be aloof and more selfish and dull-witted in this show.
* Pluto (voiced by Bill Farmer) is Mickey&#x27;s loyal dog who is often combative towards some animals.
* Ludwig Von Drake (voiced by Corey Burton) is a scientist duck who is shown to be highly intelligent but insane. He is Donald&#x27;s uncle and Huey, Dewey, and Louie&#x27;s great-uncle.

===Supporting===
* Pete (voiced by Jim Cummings) is Mickey&#x27;s rival. He is intimidating and aggressive, but extremely gullible.
* Huey, Dewey, and Louie (voiced by Russi Taylor), Donald&#x27;s naughty nephews.
* Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale (voiced by Tress MacNeille and Corey Burton), two chipmunks, common rivals of Donald and Pluto.
* The Narrator (voiced by Corey Burton), serves as a guide narrating the cartoons starring Goofy.
* Mortimer Mouse (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is Mickey&#x27;s sleazy rival who is charming, but in a condescending and harmful manner; he often flirts with Minnie Mouse and/or Daisy, and his most famous catchphrase is &quot;I CHACHA!&quot; (pronounced &quot;ha cha cha&quot;).
* Clarabelle Cow (voiced by April Winchell), a friend of Mickey&#x27;s gang. She is Horace&#x27;s girlfriend.
* Chief O&#x27;Hara (voiced by Corey Burton), police chief in the town.
* Louie the Mountain Lion (voiced by Frank Welker), a mountain lion who wants to eat Goofy.
* Butch the Bulldog (voiced by Frank Welker), a big bulldog, rival of Pluto.
* Dinah the Dachshund (voiced by Frank Welker), Pluto&#x27;s love interest.
* The Phantom Blot (voiced by John O&#x27;Hurley) is the mysterious shadow in the distance, who wants to steal all the colors for himself and leave the real world stuck in black and white.
* Salty the Seal (voiced by Frank Welker), a playful seal.
* Figaro (voiced by Frank Welker), Minnie&#x27;s pet cat.
* Humphrey the Bear (voiced by Jim Cummings), a bear of the forest.
* J. Audubon Woodlore (voiced by Corey Burton), a ranger in charge of Humphrey.
* Aracuan Bird (voiced by Frank Welker)
* Horace Horsecollar (voiced by Bill Farmer)
* Clara Cluck (voiced by Russi Taylor)
* Scrooge McDuck (voiced by Alan Young), is Donald&#x27;s uncle and Huey, Dewey, and Louie&#x27;s great-uncle.
* José Carioca (voiced by Rob Paulsen), an old friend of Donald.
* Baby Shelby (introduced) (voiced by Jeff Bennett), a small turtle who always torments Donald.
* Mrs. Turtle (introduced) (voiced by Estelle Harris), Shelby&#x27;s mother.
* Mr. Jollyland (voiced by Jeff Bennett)

==Legacy==
When the show was replaced by &quot;House of Mouse&quot; in January 2001, most of the &quot;Mouse Works&quot; segments were repeated there but the original &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; format has never been seen again.

Four of the gag cartoons were released theatrically with various Disney films during 1998 and 1999 and released to theaters as commercials for the show. The cartoons included:
* &quot;Goofy&#x27;s Extreme Sports: Skating the Half Pipe&quot; with &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot; 
* &quot;Goofy&#x27;s Extreme Sports: Paracycling&quot; with &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot;
* &quot;Pluto Gets the Paper: Spaceship&quot; with &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;
* &quot;Donald&#x27;s Dynamite: Opera Box&quot; with &quot;Doug&#x27;s 1st Movie&quot;

== Home media ==
While the series has not seen an official VHS or DVD release, several shorts have been featured on other releases.

In April 2005, Disney released a DVD in European, Latin American and Asian territories entitled &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Laugh Factory&quot;, which contained nine selected shorts taken from this series as well as those from &quot;House of Mouse&quot; with jokes told by various children used as framing material. While some shorts have the &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; title card background, others have the &quot;House of Mouse&quot; version (the &quot;Mouse Works&quot; version has various mechanics in the background including a Mickey-shaped one and one with the &quot;Mouse Works&quot; text inside it, but the &quot;House of Mouse&quot; version has various moving swirls). Cartoons include &quot;Hickory Dickory Mickey&quot;, &quot;Mickey Tries to Cook&quot;, &quot;Organ Donors&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Airplane Kit&quot;, &quot;Street Cleaner&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s New Car&quot;, &quot;Bubble Gum&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Big Break&quot; and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Mix-Up&quot;.

The DVD &quot;Disney&#x27;s Learning Adventures: Mickey&#x27;s Seeing the World&quot; includes the cartoons &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Mechanical House&quot; slightly abridged to fit in with the documentary nature of the DVD.

On November 11, 2008, the eighth wave of Walt Disney Treasures was released. One of the sets released in this wave, &quot;The Chronological Donald, Volume Four&quot;, features a handful of Donald-centric shorts from both &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot; as bonuses, including &quot;Bird Brained Donald&quot;, &quot;Donald and the Big Nut&quot;, &quot;Donald&#x27;s Charmed Date&quot;, &quot;Donald&#x27;s Dinner Date&quot;, &quot;Donald&#x27;s Failed Fourth&quot;, &quot;Donald&#x27;s Rocket Ruckus&quot;, &quot;Donald&#x27;s Shell Shots&quot;, &quot;Donald&#x27;s Valentine Dollar&quot;, &quot;Music Store Donald&quot; and &quot;Survival of the Woodchucks&quot;.

<text>Yum! Brands, Inc. (sometimes called simply Yum!) is an American multinational fast food corporation. It is a spin-off of PepsiCo, after they acquired KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. PepsiCo divested the brands in 1997, and these consolidated as Yum! The company operates KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, WingStreet (Pizza Hut&#x27;s chicken wing menu), and Habit Burger &amp; Grill since 2020, except in China, where the brands are operated by another company known as Yum China. Yum! previously also owned Long John Silver&#x27;s and A&amp;W Restaurants. Yum! was founded as Tricon Global Restaurants after PepsiCo finalized the split. In 2002, they took their current name after they merged with Yorkshire Global Restaurants, which at the time was the parent company of A&amp;W, who also spun off an international branch.

Based in Louisville, Kentucky, Yum! is one of the world&#x27;s largest fast food restaurant companies in terms of system units. Among the fast-food chains operated by Yum Brands, KFC is relocating its U.S. corporate headquarters from Louisville, Kentucky, to Plano, Texas, Yum announced on Tuesday February 18, 2025. About 100 corporate workers will move from Louisville to Plano in the next six months as a result, according to the company. In 2016, Yum! had 43,617 restaurants, including 2,859 that were company-owned and 40,758 that were franchised, in 135 nations and territories worldwide. Due to it being a spin-off of PepsiCo, all restaurants owned by this company do not serve Coca-Cola as a soft drink, and instead serve Pepsi. New Zealand restaurants serve Coca-Cola.

==History==
===PepsiCo fast food division===
The company&#x27;s history began in 1977, when PepsiCo entered the restaurant business by acquiring Pizza Hut from co-founders Dan and Frank Carney. A year later, PepsiCo purchased Taco Bell from founder Glen Bell. In July 1986, R. J. Reynolds sold KFC to PepsiCo to pay off debt from its recent purchase of Nabisco.

In 1990, Hot &#x27;n Now was acquired via Taco Bell from William Van Domelen, but the company was sold in 1996. In 1992, PepsiCo acquired California Pizza Kitchen. In 1993, it acquired Chevys Fresh Mex, D&#x27;Angelo Grilled Sandwiches, and the American division of Canadian chain East Side Mario&#x27;s. These chains were later sold when PepsiCo exited the restaurant business and spun off KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell (see next paragraph). In 1997, PepsiCo sold PepsiCo Food Systems restaurant-supply unit to Ameriserve Food Distribution Inc.

===Tricon Global Restaurants===

Yum! was created in 1997 as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo&#x27;s fast food division as the parent corporation of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies. The decision was announced in January and the spin off was effected on October 6. Tricon selected Louisville, also the site of KFC&#x27;s headquarters, as its corporate headquarters. Taco Bell and Pizza Hut continued to be headquartered in Irvine, California and Dallas, Texas, respectively.

In 2000, Tricon Global tested multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&amp;Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver&#x27;s and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver&#x27;s and was considered successful by the companies.

In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called &quot;Wing Works&quot;, a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. KFC also hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.

===Yum! Brands===
In March 2002, Yorkshire announced it would merge with Tricon Global Restaurants to form Yum! Brands. The merger was finalized on May 8, 2002, and the name change became effective on May 22, 2002. On June 6, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!&#x27;s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver&#x27;s and A&amp;W Restaurants (which previously served Coca-Cola products) began switching to Pepsi products, with A&amp;W Restaurants retaining A&amp;W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Keurig Dr Pepper).

In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers, and A&amp;W. The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.

In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise. In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicized WingStreet&#x27;s national launch.

An East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success. As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.

===International focus===

In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to dispose of its Long John Silver&#x27;s and A&amp;W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company&#x27;s announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company&#x27;s long-term growth plans. The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm&#x27;s January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to dispose of the A&amp;W and Long John Silver&#x27;s chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&amp;W and Long John Silver&#x27;s chains. A Great American Brand bought A&amp;W, and Long John Silver&#x27;s was sold to LJS Partners LLC.

In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion. The deal spent more than 4 months in antitrust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country&#x27;s restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.

In 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut was also planned.

In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain &quot;excess levels of chemical residue&quot;. Yum! had lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25, 2013.

The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC was the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country&#x27;s first drive-thru service. Yum! Brands also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.

Yum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.

In 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road. The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015. In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.

In 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop. Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas, a restaurant similar in format to Chick-fil-A, on April 9, 2014. In the summer of 2014, Yum!&#x27;s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.

In the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company. A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.

In 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country&#x27;s Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.

In January 2020, Yum! announced they were acquiring Irvine, California-based The Habit Burger Grill, for $375 million; the transaction was completed on March 18, 2020. The company was remamed Habit Burger &amp; Grill in 2024.

In 2020 and 2021, Yum! acquired several technology companies. In March 2020, it acquired Heartstyles, an omnichannel training company. In March 2021, it acquired Tictuk Technologies, an Israeli omnichannel ordering and marketing solutions provider, and announced it was acquiring Kvantum Inc., an artificial intelligence-based consumer insights and marketing technology company. In September 2021, Yum! completed the acquisition of Australian kitchen order management and delivery technology company Dragontail Systems for US$69.1 million in cash.

In December 2023 the company announced it will acquire 218 restaurants from its largest franchisee EG Group in the UK and Ireland. After completion in 2024, all of the privately owned EG Group&#x27;s KFC UK and Ireland businesses will come under Yum&#x27;s KFC UK and Ireland management.

==Corporate==
The current CEO of Yum! Brands is David Gibbs. Former CEOs include Greg Creed and David C. Novak. Novak became CEO of predecessor firm Tricon Global on January 1, 2000, and chairman of the board on January 1, 2001. Greg Creed replaced Novak in his role as CEO on January 1, 2015. At the AGM in May 2016, Robert D. Walter became non-executive chairman. At the end of 2019 Greg Creed retired as CEO and the current COO (David Gibbs) was Creed&#x27;s replacement.

Since 2006, Yum! Brands has served as the corporate sponsor of the Kentucky Derby.

On October 20, 2015, Yum! Brands, Inc., announced that it intended to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies. Yum China was spun off on November 1, 2016. Yum China&#x27;s operations excluded stores in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, which are franchised from Yum Brands through Jardine Matheson unit Jardine Pacific&#x27;s Jardine Restaurant Group.

<text>John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry (20 July 184431 January 1900), was a British nobleman of the Victorian era, remembered for his atheism, his outspoken views, his brutish manner, for lending his name to the &quot;Queensberry Rules&quot; that form the basis of modern boxing, and for his role in the downfall of the Irish author and playwright Oscar Wilde.

==Biography==
John Douglas was born in Florence, Italy, the eldest son of Conservative politician Archibald, Viscount Drumlanrig, and Caroline Margaret Clayton. He had three brothers, Francis, Archibald, and James, and two sisters, Gertrude and Florence. He was briefly styled Viscount Drumlanrig following his father&#x27;s succession in 1856, and on the latter&#x27;s death in 1858 he inherited the Marquessate of Queensberry. The 9th Marquess was educated in the training ships &quot;Illustrious&quot; and &quot;Britannia&quot; at Portsmouth, and served in the Royal Navy until resigning in 1864. He was Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the 1st Dumfriesshire Rifle Volunteers from 1869 to 1871.

In 1864, Lord Queensberry entered Magdalene College, Cambridge, which he left two years later without taking a degree. He was more distinguished in sport, playing college cricket as well as running, hunting, and steeplechasing.
He married Sibyl Montgomery in 1866. They had four sons and a daughter; his wife successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his adultery. She survived him to the age of 90, dying in 1935. Queensberry married Ethel Weeden in 1893, but this marriage was annulled the following year.
Queensberry sold the family seat of Kinmount in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, an action which further alienated him from his family.

He died, two months after a stroke, and after a period of mental decline believed to be caused by syphilis, in his club room in Welbeck Street, west London, aged 55, nearly a year before Oscar Wilde&#x27;s death. He wrote a poem starting with the words &quot;When I am dead cremate me.&quot; After cremation at Woking Crematorium, his ashes were buried at Kinmount in the Douglas Mausoleum outside Cummertrees Parish Church, a Church of Scotland.

His eldest son and heir apparent was Francis, Viscount Drumlanrig, who was rumoured to have been engaged in a homosexual relationship with the Liberal Prime Minister, the 5th Earl of Rosebery. Lord Drumlanrig died from a gunshot wound, unmarried and without children.

Douglas&#x27;s second son, Lord Percy Douglas (1868–1920), succeeded to the peerage instead. Lord Alfred &quot;Bosie&quot; Douglas, his third son, was a close friend of famous author and poet Oscar Wilde. Eventually it became known that Lord Alfred and Wilde had engaged in sexual intercourse on multiple occasions, severely damaging the reputation of both men and enraging Queensberry. Queensberry&#x27;s efforts to end that relationship ultimately led to his famous dispute with Wilde, which would culminate in Wilde&#x27;s eventual imprisonment, decline, and fall.

==Contributions to sports==
Queensberry was a patron of sport and a noted boxing enthusiast. In 1866 he was one of the founders of the Amateur Athletic Club, now the Amateur Athletic Association of England, one of the first groups that did not require amateur athletes to belong to the upper-classes to compete. The following year the Club published a set of twelve rules for conducting boxing matches. The rules had been drawn up by John Graham Chambers but appeared under Queensberry&#x27;s sponsorship and are universally known as the &quot;Queensberry Rules&quot;. These rules were eventually to govern the sport worldwide.

He was one of the first people to bring association football to Scotland, forming his own teamcalled Kinmountof which he was captain to take on the Annan N.B. team in matches in 1868. As the Annan side wore red caps, the Kinmount side wore blue caps.

A keen rider, Queensberry was also active in fox hunting and owned several successful race horses. As a rider his first winner was in the Dumfriesshire Hunt Club chase in 1865, and his last was at Sandown Park in 1883. He was Master of the Worcester Fox Hounds in 1870. He was on the committee of the National Hunt but never won a Grand National as a rider, a last-minute substitution on the victorious &quot;Old Joe&quot; keeping him out of the 1886 National. During his riding career he recovered from a series of serious injuries.

==Political career==
In 1872, Queensberry was chosen by the Peers of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer. He served as such until 1880, when he was again nominated but refused to take the religious oath of allegiance to the sovereign. Viewed by some as an outspoken atheist, he declared that he would not participate in any &quot;Christian tomfoolery&quot; and that his word should suffice. As a consequence neither he nor Charles Bradlaugh, who had also refused to take the oath after being elected to the House of Commons, were allowed to take their seats in parliament. This prompted an apology from the new prime minister, William Gladstone. Bradlaugh was re-elected four times by the constituents of Northampton until he was finally allowed to take his seat in 1886. Queensberry, however, was never again sent to parliament by the Scottish nobles.

In 1881, Queensberry accepted the presidency of the British Secular Union, a group that had broken away in 1877 from Bradlaugh&#x27;s National Secular Society. That year he published a long philosophical poem, &quot;The Spirit of the Matterhorn&quot;, which he had written in Zermatt in 1873 in an attempt to articulate his secularist views. In 1882, he was ejected from the theatre after loudly interrupting a performance of the play &quot;The Promise of May&quot; by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, the Poet Laureate, because it included a villainous atheist in its cast of characters. Under the auspices of the British Secular Union, Queensberry wrote a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Religion of Secularism and the Perfectibility of Man&quot;. The Union, always small, ceased to function in 1884.

His divorces, brutality, atheism, and association with the boxing world made Queensberry an unpopular figure in London high society. In 1893 his eldest son Francis was made a baron in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, thus giving him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Queensberry resented his son sitting in a chamber that had refused to admit him, leading to a bitter dispute between himself and both his son and the Earl of Rosebery, who had promoted Francis&#x27;s ennoblement and who shortly thereafter became prime minister. Francis was killed in a shooting accident in 1894; the inquest returned an &quot;accidental death&quot; verdict, but his death may have been a suicide. Queensberry believed, as he put it in a letter, that &quot;snob queers like Rosebery&quot; had corrupted his sons, and held Rosebery responsible for Francis&#x27;s death.

==Dispute with Oscar Wilde==


In February 1895, angered by the apparent ongoing homosexual relationship between his son Alfred and Oscar Wilde,
Queensberry left a calling card reading &quot;For Oscar Wilde, posing &quot; at Wilde&#x27;s club. Wilde sued for criminal libel, leading to Queensberry&#x27;s arrest.

The trial opened at the Old Bailey on 3 April 1895 before Justice Richard Henn Collins amid scenes of near hysteria both in the press and the public galleries. Queensberry&#x27;s lawyers, headed by barrister Edward Carson, presented Wilde as a vicious older man who seduced innocent young boys into a life of degenerate homosexuality. Wilde dropped the libel case when Queensberry&#x27;s lawyers informed the court that they intended to call several male prostitutes as witnesses to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. According to the Libel Act 1843, proving the truth of the accusation and a public interest in its exposure was a defence against a libel charge, and Wilde&#x27;s lawyers concluded that the prostitutes&#x27; testimony was likely to do that. Queensberry won a counterclaim against Wilde for the expenses he had incurred from lawyers and private detectives in organizing his defence. Wilde was left bankrupt; his assets were later seized and sold at auction to pay the claim.

Queensberry then sent the evidence collected by his detectives to Scotland Yard, which resulted in Wilde being charged and convicted of gross indecency under the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 and sentenced to two years&#x27; hard labour, which he served (1895-1897). Upon release, Wilde immediately went into exile in France, his health and reputation destroyed.

Queensberry died on 31 January 1900. Ten months later, Oscar Wilde died at the Hotel d&#x27;Alsace in Paris.

==Screen portrayals==

Queensberry has been portrayed by a number of actors in later dramatisations of the Wilde-Alfred Douglas affair, notably:
*Edward Chapman in 20th Century Fox movie &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot; (1960).
*Lionel Jeffries in United Artists movie &quot;The Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot; (1960)
*Keith Richards in promotional film for the Rolling Stones song, “We Love You” (1967)
*Tom Wilkinson in biographical film &quot;Wilde&quot; (1997).

An effeminately flamboyant caricature of him, voiced by Jim Rash, is featured as a main character in the Adult Swim cartoon &quot;Mike Tyson Mysteries&quot; in which he serves as a lifestyle coach to Mike Tyson.

<doc id="74095" wikidata="Q460660" url="?curid=74095" title="Lord Alfred Douglas">
<text>Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas (22 October 1870 – 20 March 1945), also known as Bosie Douglas, was an English poet and journalist, and a lover of Oscar Wilde. At Oxford University he edited an undergraduate journal, &quot;The Spirit Lamp&quot;, that carried a homoerotic subtext, and met Wilde, starting a close but stormy relationship. Douglas&#x27;s father, John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry, abhorred it and set out to humiliate Wilde, publicly accusing him of homosexuality. Wilde sued him for criminal libel, but some intimate notes were found and Wilde was later imprisoned. On his release, he briefly lived with Douglas in Naples, but they had separated by the time Wilde died in 1900. Douglas married a poet, Olive Custance, in 1902 and had a son, Raymond.

On converting to Catholicism in 1911, he repudiated homosexuality, and in a Catholic magazine, &quot;Plain English&quot;, expressed openly antisemitic views, but rejected the policies of Nazi Germany. He was jailed for libelling Winston Churchill over claims of World War I misconduct. Douglas wrote several books of verse, some in a homoerotic Uranian genre. The phrase &quot;The love that dare not speak its name&quot; appears in one (), though it is widely misattributed to Wilde.

==Early life and background==

Douglas was born at Ham Hill House in Powick, Worcestershire, the third son of John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry and his first wife, Sibyl Montgomery. He was born on 22 October 1870.

He was his mother&#x27;s favourite child; she called him Bosie (a derivative of &quot;boysie&quot;, as in boy), a nickname which stuck for the rest of his life. His mother successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his father&#x27;s adultery. The Marquess later married Ethel Weeden in 1893 but the marriage was annulled the following year.

Douglas was educated at Wixenford School, Winchester College (1884–88) and Magdalen College, Oxford (1889–93), which he left without obtaining a degree. At Oxford, he edited an undergraduate journal, &quot;The Spirit Lamp&quot; (1892–3), an activity that intensified the constant conflict between him and his father. Their relationship had always been a strained one and, during the Queensberry-Wilde feud, Douglas sided with Wilde, even encouraging Wilde to prosecute the Marquess for libel. In 1893, Douglas had a brief affair with George Ives.

In 1858 his grandfather, Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry, had died in what was reported as a shooting accident, but was widely believed to have been suicide. In 1862, his widowed grandmother, Lady Queensberry, converted to Catholicism and took her children to live in Paris. One of his uncles, Lord James Douglas, was deeply attached to his twin sister &quot;Florrie&quot; (Lady Florence Douglas) and was heartbroken when she married a baronet, Sir Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie. In 1885, Lord James tried to abduct a young girl, and after that became ever more manic; in 1888, he made a disastrous marriage. Separated from Florrie, James drank himself into a deep depression, and in 1891 committed suicide by cutting his throat. Another of his uncles, Lord Francis Douglas (1847–1865) had died in a climbing accident on the Matterhorn. His uncle Lord Archibald Edward Douglas (1850–1938) became a clergyman. Alfred Douglas&#x27;s aunt, Lord James&#x27;s twin Lady Florence Dixie (1855–1905), was an author, war correspondent for the &quot;Morning Post&quot; during the First Boer War, and a feminist. In 1890, she published a novel, &quot;Gloriana, or the Revolution of 1900&quot;, in which women&#x27;s suffrage is achieved after a woman posing as a man named Hector D&#x27;Estrange is elected to the House of Commons. The character D&#x27;Estrange is clearly based on Oscar Wilde.

==Relationship with Wilde==
In 1891, Lionel Johnson brought Douglas to the home of Oscar Wilde in Tite Street, Chelsea, for afternoon tea. Wilde took an interest in Douglas but it was six months before they became intimate and their affair began. In 1894, the Robert Hichens novel &quot;The Green Carnation&quot; was published, a &quot;roman à clef&quot; depicting satirically Douglas&#x27;s dependent relationship on Wilde.

Douglas has been described as spoiled, reckless, insolent and extravagant. He would spend money on boys and gambling and expected Wilde to contribute to funding his tastes. They often argued and broke up, but would always be reconciled.

Douglas had praised Wilde&#x27;s play &quot;Salome&quot; in the Oxford magazine &quot;The Spirit Lamp&quot;, of which he was editor. Wilde had originally written &quot;Salomé&quot; in French, and in 1893 he commissioned Douglas to translate it into English. Douglas&#x27;s French was very poor and his translation was highly criticised; for example, a passage that runs &quot;On ne doit regarder que dans les miroirs&quot; (&quot;One should look only in mirrors&quot;) he rendered &quot;One must not look at mirrors&quot;. Douglas was angered at Wilde&#x27;s criticism, and claimed that the errors were in fact in Wilde&#x27;s original play. This led to a hiatus in the relationship and a row between the two, with angry messages being exchanged and even the involvement of the publisher John Lane and the illustrator Aubrey Beardsley when they themselves objected to the poor standard of Douglas&#x27;s work. Beardsley complained to Robbie Ross: &quot;For one week the numbers of telegraph and messenger boys who came to the door was simply scandalous&quot;. Wilde redid much of the translation himself, but in a gesture of reconciliation suggested that Douglas be dedicated as the translator rather than be credited, along with him, on the title page. Accepting this, Douglas, likened the difference between sharing the title page and having a dedication to &quot;the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman&quot;.

In 1894, Douglas came and visited Oscar Wilde in Worthing, to the consternation of the latter&#x27;s wife Constance.

On another occasion, while staying with Wilde in Brighton, Douglas fell ill with influenza and was nursed by Wilde, but failed to return the favour when Wilde himself fell ill having caught influenza in consequence. Instead Douglas moved to the luxurious Grand Hotel and on Wilde&#x27;s 40th birthday sent him a letter informing him that he had charged Wilde with the hotel bill. Douglas also gave his old clothes to male prostitutes, but failed to remove from the pockets incriminating letters exchanged between him and Wilde, which were then used for blackmail.

Alfred&#x27;s father, the Marquess of Queensberry, suspected the liaison to be more than a friendship. He sent his son a letter, attacking him for leaving Oxford without a degree and failing to take up a proper career. He threatened to &quot;disown [Alfred] and stop all money supplies.&quot; Alfred responded with a telegram rudely stating: &quot;What a funny little man you are.&quot;

Queensberry&#x27;s next letter threatened his son with a &quot;thrashing&quot; and accused him of being &quot;crazy&quot;. He also threatened to &quot;make a public scandal in a way you little dream of&quot; if he continued his relationship with Wilde.

Queensberry was well known for his short temper and threatening to beat people with a horsewhip. Alfred sent his father a postcard stating &quot;I detest you&quot; and making it clear that he would take Wilde&#x27;s side in a fight between him and the Marquess, &quot;with a loaded revolver&quot;.

In answer Queensberry wrote to Alfred (whom he addressed as &quot;You miserable creature&quot;) that he had divorced Alfred&#x27;s mother so as not to &quot;run the risk of bringing more creatures into the world like yourself&quot; and that when Alfred was a baby, &quot;I cried over you the bitterest tears a man ever shed, that I had brought such a creature into the world, and unwittingly committed such a crime... You must be demented.&quot;

Douglas&#x27;s eldest brother Francis Viscount Drumlanrig died in a suspicious hunting accident in October 1894, as rumours circulated that he had been having a homosexual relationship with the Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery, and that the cause of death was suicide. The Marquess of Queensberry thus embarked on a campaign to save his other son and began a public persecution of Wilde. Wilde had been openly flamboyant and his actions made the public suspicious even before the trial. The Marquess and a bodyguard confronted Wilde in Wilde&#x27;s home; later, Queensberry planned to throw rotten vegetables at Wilde on the first night of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, but forewarned of this, Wilde was able to deny him access to the theatre.

Queensberry then publicly insulted Wilde by leaving at the latter&#x27;s club a visiting card on which he had written, &quot;For Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite &quot;. The wording is in dispute – the handwriting is unclear – although Hyde reports it as this. According to Merlin Holland, Wilde&#x27;s grandson, it is more likely &quot;Posing somdomite&quot;, while Queensberry himself claimed it to be &quot;Posing as somdomite&quot;. Holland suggests that this wording (&quot;posing [as] ...&quot;) would have been easier to defend in court.

==1895 trials==

With Douglas&#x27;s avid support, but against the advice of friends such as Robbie Ross, Frank Harris and George Bernard Shaw, Wilde had Queensberry arrested and charged with criminal libel in a private prosecution, as sodomy was then a criminal offence. According to the libel laws of the time, since his authorship of the charge of sodomy was not in question, Queensberry could avoid conviction by demonstrating in court not only that the charge he had made was true but also that there was a public interest in having made the charge public. Edward Carson, Queensberry&#x27;s lawyer, portrayed Wilde as a vicious older man who preyed upon naive young boys and with extravagant gifts and promises of a glamorous lifestyle seduced them into a life of homosexuality. Several highly suggestive erotic letters that Wilde had written to Douglas were introduced as evidence; Wilde claimed they were works of art. Wilde was questioned closely on the homoerotic themes in &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; and &quot;The Chameleon&quot;, a single-issue magazine published by Douglas to which Wilde had contributed &quot;Phrases and Philosophies for Use of the Young&quot;.

Queensberry&#x27;s attorney announced in court that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. Wilde&#x27;s lawyers advised him that this would make a conviction on the libel charge very unlikely; he then dropped the libel charge, on his lawyers&#x27; advice, to avoid further pointless scandal. Without a conviction, the libel law of the time left Wilde liable to pay Queensberry&#x27;s considerable legal costs, leaving him bankrupt. Based on the evidence raised during the case, Wilde was arrested the next day and charged with committing criminal sodomy and &quot;gross indecency&quot;, a crime capable of being committed only by two men, which might include sexual acts other than sodomy.

Douglas&#x27;s September 1892 poem &quot;&quot; (published in the Oxford magazine &quot;The Chameleon&quot; in December 1894) was used against Wilde at the latter&#x27;s trial. It ends with the famous line that calls homosexuality &quot;the love that dare not speak its name&quot;, which is often attributed wrongly to Wilde. Wilde gave an eloquent but counter-productive explanation of the nature of this love on the witness stand. The trial resulted in a hung jury.

In 1895, when Wilde was released on bail during his trials, Douglas&#x27;s cousin Sholto Johnstone Douglas stood surety for £500 of the bail money. The prosecutor opted to retry the case. Wilde was convicted on 25 May 1895 and sentenced to two years&#x27; hard labour, first at Pentonville, then Wandsworth, then famously in Reading Gaol. Douglas was forced into exile in Europe.

While in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a long and critical letter titled &quot;De Profundis&quot;, describing how he felt about him. Wilde was not permitted to send it but it might have been sent to him after Wilde&#x27;s release. It was given to Robbie Ross with instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotations and did not know there was a letter until reference was made to it in a biography of Wilde&#x27;s on which Ross had consulted. After Wilde&#x27;s release on 19 May 1897, the two reunited in August at Rouen but stayed together only a few months due to personal differences and various pressures on them.

==Naples and Paris==
The meeting in Rouen was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. During the later part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together in Naples, but they separated due to financial pressures and for other personal reasons. Wilde spent the rest of his life mainly in Paris; Douglas returned to Britain in late 1898. The cohabitation period in Naples later became controversial. Wilde claimed Douglas had offered a home, but had no funds or ideas. When Douglas eventually gained funds from his late father&#x27;s estate, he refused to grant Wilde a permanent allowance, although he gave him occasional sums. Wilde was still bankrupt when he died in 1900. Douglas served as chief mourner, but there was reportedly a graveside altercation between him and Robbie Ross that developed into a feud and foreshadowed the later litigation between the two former lovers of Wilde.

==Marriage==

After Wilde&#x27;s death, Douglas made a close friendship with Olive Custance, a bisexual heiress and poet. They married on 4 March 1902. Olive Custance was in a relationship with the writer Natalie Barney when she and Douglas first met. Barney and Douglas eventually became close friends and Barney was named godmother to their son, Raymond Wilfred Sholto Douglas, born on 17 November 1902.

The marriage grew stormy after Douglas became a Catholic in 1911. They separated in 1913, lived together for a time in the 1920s after Custance also converted, and then lived apart after she gave up her Catholicism. The health of their only child further strained the marriage, which by the end of the 1920s was all but over, although they never divorced.

==Repudiation of Wilde==
In 1911, Douglas embraced Catholicism as Wilde had done earlier. More than a decade after Wilde&#x27;s death, with the release of suppressed portions of Wilde&#x27;s &quot;De Profundis&quot; letter in 1912, Douglas turned against his former friend, whose homosexuality he grew to condemn. He was a defence witness in the libel case brought by Maud Allan against Noel Pemberton Billing in 1918. Billing had accused Allan, who was performing Wilde&#x27;s play &quot;Salome&quot;, of being part of a deliberate homosexual conspiracy to undermine the war effort.

Douglas also contributed to Billing&#x27;s journal &quot;Vigilante&quot; as part of his campaign against Robbie Ross. He had written a poem calling Margot Asquith one &quot;bound with Lesbian fillets&quot;, while her husband Prime Minister Herbert gave Ross money. During the trial he called Wilde as &quot;the greatest force for evil that has appeared in Europe during the last three hundred and fifty years&quot;, adding that he intensely regretted having met Wilde and helped him with the French translation of &quot;Salome&quot;, which he called &quot;a most pernicious and abominable piece of work&quot;.

==&quot;Plain English&quot;==
In 1920 Douglas founded a right-wing, Catholic, and deeply antisemitic weekly magazine called &quot;Plain English&quot;, in which he collaborated with Harold Sherwood Spencer and initially Thomas William Hodgson Crosland. It claimed to succeed &quot;The Academy&quot;, to which Douglas had been a contributing editor. &quot;Plain English&quot; ran until the end of 1922. Douglas later admitted that its policy was &quot;strongly anti-Semitic&quot;.

From August 1920 (issue No 8) &quot;Plain English&quot; began publishing a long series of articles called &quot;The Jewish Peril&quot; by Major-General Count Cherep-Spiridovitch, whose title was taken from the fore-title of George Shanks&#x27;s version of a fraudulent work, &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. &quot;Plain English&quot; advertised from issue 20 The Britons&#x27; second edition of Shank&#x27;s version of the &quot;Protocols&quot;. Douglas challenged the &quot;Jewish Guardian&quot;, published by the League of British Jews, to take him to court, suggesting they refrained from doing so because they were &quot;well aware of the absolute truth of the allegations which we have made.&quot; The magazine suggested in 1921, &quot;We need a Ku Klux Klan in this country,&quot; but a promotion for &quot;Ostara&quot; magazine was generally not well received by readers.

Other regular targets of the magazine included David Lloyd George, Alfred Viscount Northcliffe, H. G. Wells, Frank Harris, and Sinn Féin. In December 1920 the magazine was the first to publish the secret constitution of the Irish Republican Brotherhood.

From 25 December 1920 it began publishing notorious articles alleging that a &quot;powerful individual in the Admiralty&quot; had alerted the Germans at the Battle of Jutland that the British had broken their code, and that Winston Churchill had falsified a report in return for a large sum of money from Ernest Cassel, who thereby profited. In May 1921 Douglas insinuated that Lord Kitchener had been murdered by Jews.

Douglas ceased to be editor after issue 67 in 1921, after a row with Spencer. He then produced a short-lived, almost identical rival called &quot;Plain Speech&quot; in 1921 with Herbert Moore Pim. Its first issue contained a letter from a correspondent in Germany praising &quot;Herr Hittler&quot; (so spelt) and &quot;The German White Labour Party&quot;.

In 1920 he adhered to the idea of &quot;the Jewish Peril&quot;, but noted, &quot;Christian Charity forbids us to join in wholesale and indiscriminate abuse and vilification of an entire race.&quot; In 1921 he declared it was not acceptable to &quot;shift responsibility&quot; onto the Jews. In his 1929 &quot;Autobiography&quot; he wrote, &quot;I feel now that it is ridiculous to make accusations against the Jews, attributing them qualities and methods which are really much more typically English than Jewish,&quot; and then indicated the country had only itself to blame if the Jews came in and trampled on it.

The historian Colin Holmes argued that while &quot;Douglas had been to the forefront of anti-semitism in the early 1920s, he was quite unable to come to terms with the vicious racist anti-semitism in Germany&quot; under the Nazis. Politically Douglas described himself as &quot;a strong Conservative of the &#x27;Diehard&#x27; variety&quot;.

==Libel actions==
Douglas started his &quot;litigious and libellous career&quot; by gaining an apology and 50 guineas each from the Oxford and Cambridge university magazines &quot;Isis&quot; and &quot;Cambridge&quot; for defamatory references to him in an article on Wilde.

Douglas was plaintiff or defendant in several trials for civil or criminal libel. In 1913 he was charged with libelling his father-in-law. That same year he accused Arthur Ransome of libelling him in his book &quot;Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study&quot;. He saw the trial as a weapon against his enemy Ross, not understanding that Ross would not be called to give evidence. The court found in Ransome&#x27;s favour and Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit. Ransome removed the offending passages from the second edition.

The prime case was brought by the Crown on Winston Churchill&#x27;s behalf in 1923. Douglas was found guilty of libelling Churchill and sentenced to six months in prison. Churchill had been accused as cabinet minister of falsifying an official report on the Battle of Jutland in 1916, when although suffering losses, the Royal Navy drove the German battle fleet off the high seas. Churchill was said to have reported that the British Navy had in fact been defeated, the supposed motive being that when the news was flashed, British security prices would tumble on the world&#x27;s stock exchanges, allowing a group of named Jewish financiers to snap them up cheaply. Churchill&#x27;s reward was a houseful of furniture valued at £40,000. The allegations were made by Douglas in &quot;Plain English&quot; and later at a public meeting in London. A false report of a crushing British naval defeat had indeed been planted in the New York press by German interests, but by this time (after the failure of his Dardanelles Campaign) Churchill was unconnected with the Admiralty. As the attorney general noted in court on Churchill&#x27;s behalf, there was &quot;no plot, no phoney communiqué, no stock market raid and no present of fine furniture&quot;.

In 1924, while in prison, Douglas echoed Wilde&#x27;s composition of &quot;De Profundis&quot; (From the Depths) during his incarceration and wrote his last major poetic work, &quot;In Excelsis&quot; (In the Highest) in 17 cantos. Since the prison authorities would not allow Douglas to take the manuscript with him on his release, he had to rewrite the work from memory. Douglas maintained that his health never recovered from his harsh prison ordeal, which included sleeping on a plank bed without a mattress.

==Later life==
Douglas&#x27;s feelings towards Wilde began to soften after Douglas&#x27;s own incarceration in 1924. He wrote in &quot;Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up&quot;, &quot;Sometimes a sin is also a crime (for example, a murder or theft), but this is not the case with homosexuality, any more than with adultery.&quot; In 1933 he gave a talk about poetry to the Catholic Poetry Society on &#x27;The Catholic attitude to certain poets.&#x27; Of Wilde, Douglas said: &#x27;Many years [after Wilde&#x27;s death] and after I had become a Catholic, I reacted violently against him...Converts are very apt to be censorious and to be more Catholic than Catholics...I hope I am now more charitable and broad-minded than I was...After swinging to two extremes in my estimate of Wilde I have now got into what I believe to be the happy mean.&#x27; Similarly, in 1935 he wrote to the theatre manager Norman Marshall regarding Marshall&#x27;s proposed production of a play about the Wilde scandal, closing his letter, &#x27;Devoted as I still am and always will be to the memory of this brilliant and wonderful man and conscious as I am and always shall be about my own failings...Wilde was the author of what I consider to be, apart from Shakespeare, the finest comedy in the English language.&#x27;

Throughout the 1930s and up to his death, Douglas kept up correspondence with many people, including Marie Stopes and George Bernard Shaw. Anthony Wynn based his play &quot;Bernard and Bosie: A Most Unlikely Friendship&quot; on the letters between Shaw and Douglas. One of Douglas&#x27;s final public appearances was a well-received lecture to the Royal Society of Literature on 2 September 1943 on &quot;The Principles of Poetry&quot;, published in an edition of 1,000 copies. He attacked the poetry of T. S. Eliot; the talk was praised by Arthur Quiller-Couch and Augustus John.

Harold Nicolson described his impression of Douglas after meeting him at a lunch party in 1936: 

In the book, &quot;Secret Historian&quot;, Samuel Steward (a professor, poet, and novelist) wrote in his diary that he met Lord Alfred Douglas when Douglas was 67; Steward was 27. Lord Alfred professed that he was beyond &quot;sins of the flesh,&quot; yet ends up in bed with Steward. Douglas proclaims that Wilde and he did little more than kiss and find other men for each other.

Douglas&#x27;s only child, Raymond, was diagnosed in 1927, at the age of 24, with schizoaffective disorder and entered St Andrew&#x27;s Hospital, a mental institution. Though decertified and discharged after five years, he suffered another breakdown and returned to the hospital. In February 1944, when his mother died of a cerebral haemorrhage at the age of 70, Raymond was able to attend her funeral, and in June he was again decertified. His conduct rapidly deteriorated, and he returned to St Andrew&#x27;s in November, where he stayed until his death on 10 October 1964.

==Death==

Douglas died of congestive heart failure in Lancing, West Sussex, on 20 March 1945 at the age of 74. He was buried on 23 March at the Franciscan Friary, Crawley, alongside his mother, who had died on 31 October 1935 at the age of 90. They share a gravestone.

The elderly Douglas, living a reduced life in Hove in the 1940s, appears in the diaries of Henry Channon and in the first autobiography of Donald Sinden, whose son Marc Sinden claimed his father was one of only two people at the funeral. In fact the funeral report in &quot;The Times&quot; named some 20 mourners, including Sinden, with &quot;other friends&quot;. He died at the home of Edward and Sheila Colman, who were the main beneficiaries in his will, inheriting the copyright to his work.

==Writings==
Douglas published several volumes of poetry and two books about his relationship with Wilde, &quot;Oscar Wilde and Myself&quot; (1914, largely ghost-written by T. W. H. Crosland, assistant editor of the literary journal &quot;The Academy&quot; and later repudiated by Douglas) and &quot;Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up&quot; (1940). He also wrote two memoirs: &quot;The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas&quot; (1929) and &quot;Without Apology&quot; (1938).

Douglas edited &quot;The Academy&quot; from 1907 to 1910, during which time he had an affair with the artist Romaine Brooks, who was also bisexual. The main love of her life, Natalie Clifford Barney, also had an affair with Wilde&#x27;s niece Dorothy and even, in 1901, with Douglas&#x27;s future wife Olive Custance, the year before the couple married.

Of the six biographies of Douglas, the earlier ones by Braybrooke and Freeman were forbidden to quote from his copyright work, while &quot;De Profundis&quot; was unpublished. Later biographies were by Rupert Croft-Cooke, H. Montgomery Hyde (who also wrote about Wilde), Douglas Murray (who called Braybrooke&#x27;s biography &quot;a rehash and exaggeration of Douglas&#x27;s book&quot; [his autobiography]). The most recent is &quot;Alfred Douglas: A Poet&#x27;s Life and His Finest Work&quot; by Caspar Wintermans in 2007.

In 1999, The University of Oxford established the Lord Alfred Douglas Memorial Prize for &quot;...the best sonnet or other poem written in English and in strict rhyming metre.&quot; The award was established by Douglas&#x27;s friend Sheila Coleman, who, on her death, left a legacy of $36,000 to fund the award.

==In Popular Culture==
In the films &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot; and &quot;The Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot;, both released in 1960, Douglas was portrayed by John Neville and John Fraser respectively. In the 1997 British film &quot;Wilde&quot;, Douglas was portrayed by Jude Law. In the 2018 film &quot;The Happy Prince&quot;, he was portrayed by Colin Morgan.

In the BBC drama &quot;Oscar&quot; (1985) he was portrayed by Robin Lermitte (credited as Robin McCallum); Michael Gambon played Wilde.

The queer history podcast Bad Gays covered Douglas in Episode 2 of their first season.
