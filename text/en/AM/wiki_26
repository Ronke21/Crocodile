<text>Steven Frederic Seagal ( ; born April 10, 1952) is an American actor, producer, screenwriter, martial artist, and musician. A 7th-dan black belt in aikido, he began his adult life as a martial arts instructor in Japan where he became the first American to teach in an aikido dojo. He later moved to Los Angeles where he continued teaching aikido. In 1988, Seagal made his acting debut in &quot;Above the Law&quot;, which is regarded as the first American film to feature aikido in fight sequences. He has appeared in over 50 films.

By 1991, he had starred in three commercially successful films, and would go on to achieve greater fame in &quot;Under Siege&quot; (1992), where he played Navy SEALs counter-terrorist expert Casey Ryback, a role he reprised in the sequel &quot;Under Siege 2: Dark Territory&quot; (1995). In 1994, he starred in his directorial debut film &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot;. During the latter half of the 1990s, Seagal starred in three more feature films and the direct-to-video film &quot;The Patriot&quot;. Subsequently, his career shifted to mostly direct-to-video productions. He has since appeared in films and reality shows, most notably as the main villain in Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;Machete&quot; (2010), and &quot;Steven Seagal: Lawman&quot;, which depicted Seagal performing duties as a reserve deputy sheriff.

Seagal is a guitarist and has released two studio albums, &quot;Songs from the Crystal Cave&quot; and &quot;Mojo Priest&quot;, and performed on the scores of several of his films. He has worked with Stevie Wonder and Tony Rebel, who both performed on his debut album. He has been involved in a line of &quot;therapeutic oil&quot; products and energy drinks. Seagal is an environmentalist, animal rights activist, and supporter of 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso. In 2004, he was inducted into the Martial Arts History Museum Hall of Fame.

Seagal has been the subject of controversy during his career. Since 1991, multiple women have accused Seagal of sexual harassment or assault. A supporter of Vladimir Putin, he backed the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. He was granted both Russian and Serbian citizenship in 2016. In 2018, he was appointed Russia&#x27;s special envoy to the U.S.

== Early life ==
Seagal was born on April 10, 1952, in Lansing, Michigan, the son of Patricia Anne Fisher, a medical technician, and Samuel Seagal, a mathematics teacher. His mother was of Irish descent, while his father was Jewish. His paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. During an interview for the Russian talk show &quot;Let Them Talk&quot;, Seagal stated that he has paternal ancestors from the Siberian city of Vladivostok, as well as Belarus and Saint Petersburg. He claims that genetic testing determined that he has Yakut and Buryat ancestry as well. When he was 5, Seagal moved with his parents to Fullerton, California. His mother later told &quot;People&quot; magazine that prior to the move Seagal was frail and suffered from asthma: &quot;He was a puny kid back then. But he really thrived after the move [from Michigan].&quot;

Seagal attended Buena Park High School in Buena Park, California, and Fullerton College between 1970 and 1971. Seagal has been described as a “pathological liar” due to his propensity of making greatly exaggerated or outright fabricated statements about his personal life and achievements. For instance, Seagal has claimed that he was a student of the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba; despite the fact that Ueshiba died in 1969 when Seagal was 17 and five years before Seagal moved to Japan at age 22 — when he moved there to allegedly avoid the draft for the Vietnam War by marrying a Japanese national.

== Martial arts and Japan ==
According to Seagal&#x27;s first wife, Miyako Fujitani: &quot;I met Steven in California in the fall of 1974. He followed me back to Japan in October. We got married in December 1974.&quot; Fujitani was a second-degree black belt and daughter of an Osaka aikido master who had come to Los Angeles to teach aikido. After they married, they had a son, Kentaro, and a daughter, Ayako. Seagal taught at the school owned by Miyako&#x27;s family and earned his aikido black belt in 1978. Interviewed in 1993, Fujitani stated that: &quot;The only reason Steven was awarded the black belt was because the judge, who was famous for his laziness, fell asleep during Steven&#x27;s presentation. The judge just gave him the black belt.&quot;

Seagal has claimed that he helped train CIA agents in Japan: &quot;They saw my abilities, both with martial arts and with the language. You could say that I became an advisor to several CIA agents in the field, and through my friends in the CIA, I met many powerful people and did special works and favors.&quot; Fujitani has refuted these allegations and has also dismissed Seagal&#x27;s claims that he had combatted yakuza. There is no evidence that Seagal has ever worked with the Central Intelligence Agency. In the early-1980s, Seagal had aspirations to return to America and become a movie star. Fujitani then &quot;scrimped and saved for years, even denying herself and her children necessities, to help pay his way home.&quot; According to Fujitani, &quot;he then availed himself of her savings and hied off.&quot;

Seagal returned to Taos, New Mexico, with his student (and later film stuntman) Craig Dunn, where they opened a dojo, although Seagal spent much of his time pursuing other ventures. After another period in Japan, Seagal returned to the United States in 1983 with senior student Haruo Matsuoka. They opened an aikido dojo, initially in North Hollywood, but later moved it to the city of West Hollywood. Seagal left Matsuoka in charge of the dojo, which the latter ran until the two parted ways in 1997. In the early 1980s, Seagal had his first experiences in the film industry by working as a fight coordinator on &quot;The Challenge&quot; (1982) which was shot in Japan, and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983).

Later in his career, Seagal helped train Brazilian mixed martial artist Lyoto Machida, who credited Seagal for helping him perfect the front kick that he used to knock out Randy Couture at &quot;UFC 129&quot; in May 2011.

== Career ==
=== 1987–2002: Hollywood action star ===
In 1987, Seagal began work on his first film as an actor, &quot;Above the Law&quot; (titled &quot;Nico&quot; in Europe), with director Andrew Davis. Seagal was asked to make the film by agent Michael Ovitz, who reportedly became convinced that Seagal had movie star potential after taking aikido classes with him. Ovitz financed Seagal&#x27;s successful screen test, which led Seagal to be offered a contract by Warner Bros. Ovitz&#x27; role in starting Seagal&#x27;s acting career led to a long-standing, unfounded rumor that the agent had made a bet that he could turn anyone into a movie star and decided to bank on his martial arts teacher to win his wager. &quot;Above the Law&quot; was a success, grossing $18,869,631 in the U.S. and Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; stated &quot;It contains 50 percent more plot than it needs, but that allows it room to grow in areas not ordinarily covered in action thrillers.&quot; Following its success, Seagal&#x27;s subsequent movies were &quot;Hard to Kill&quot;, &quot;Marked for Death&quot;, and &quot;Out for Justice&quot;; all were box office hits and made Seagal an action hero. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Seagal is effective for both his novelty value and his ability to be both literally and figuratively disarming.&quot;

Seagal achieved mainstream success in 1992 with the release of &quot;Under Siege&quot;, which reunited him with director Andrew Davis for what critics described as &quot;&quot;Die Hard&quot; on a battleship&quot;. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 79% based on reviews from 28 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A well-directed action thriller that makes the most of its confined setting, &quot;Under Siege&quot; marks a high point for early &#x27;90s action—and its star&#x27;s spotty filmography.&quot; Reviewers praised Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey&#x27;s performances as the film&#x27;s villains, and it is often considered Seagal&#x27;s best film to date.

On April 20, 1991, Seagal hosted Season 16, Episode 18 of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The series&#x27; long-time executive producer Lorne Michaels and cast-members David Spade and Tim Meadows called Seagal the show&#x27;s &quot;worst host ever&quot;. Spade and Meadows cited Seagal&#x27;s humorlessness, his ill-treatment of the cast and writers, and his refusal to do a &quot;Hans and Franz&quot; sketch because the skit&#x27;s title characters had previously said that they could &quot;beat up Steven Seagal&quot;. Seagal has never been invited back to the show. Meadows commented, &quot;He didn&#x27;t realize that you can&#x27;t tell somebody they&#x27;re stupid on Wednesday and expect them to continue writing for you on Saturday.&quot;

SNL cast member Julia Sweeney later recalled that Seagal &quot;had this idea that he&#x27;s a therapist and he wanted Victoria Jackson to be his patient who&#x27;s just been raped. And the therapist says, &#x27;You&#x27;re going to have to come to me twice a week for like three years,&quot; because, he said, &#x27;That&#x27;s how therapists freaking are. They&#x27;re just trying to get your money.&#x27; And then he says that the psychiatrist tries to have sex with her.&quot; The cast and crew&#x27;s difficulties with Seagal were later echoed on-air by Michaels during guest host Nicolas Cage&#x27;s monologue in the September 26, 1992, Season 18 premiere. When Cage worried that he would do so poorly that the audience would regard him as &quot;the biggest jerk who&#x27;s ever been on the show&quot;, Michaels replied: &quot;No, no. That would be Steven Seagal.&quot;

Seagal directed and starred in &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot; (1994), featuring Michael Caine, R. Lee Ermey, and Billy Bob Thornton in minor supporting roles. The film emphasized environmental and spiritual themes, signaling a break with his previous persona as a genre-ready inner-city cop. &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot; was poorly received by critics, especially denouncing Seagal&#x27;s long environmental speech in the film. Regardless, Seagal considers it one of the most important and relevant moments in his career. Seagal followed this with a sequel to one of his most successful films, &quot;Under Siege&quot;, titled &quot;Under Siege 2: Dark Territory&quot; (1995). According to co-star Morris Chestnut, Seagal rewrote many of the scenes he was in. &quot;The only time they really stuck to the script or had ad libs was the stuff when he really wasn&#x27;t there. It was a lot of stuff, because at that time I think he was flying a helicopter, he was doing something... He would come to set, &quot;Okay, you&#x27;re gonna say this. I&#x27;m gonna say this and this is gonna happen and then you do that.&quot; That&#x27;s how we did a lot of that movie.&quot;

In 1996, Seagal had a role in the Kurt Russell film &quot;Executive Decision&quot;, portraying a special ops soldier who appears in only the film&#x27;s first 45 minutes. Former Warner Bros Vice President Bill Daly later stated Seagal agreed to the role in exchange for the studio forgiving him losing his director&#x27;s salary due to going over-budget with &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot;. The same year, he filmed a police drama &quot;The Glimmer Man&quot; (1996). In another environmentally conscious and commercially unsuccessful film, &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; (1997), he played an EPA Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance agent fighting industrialists dumping toxic waste in the Kentucky hills.

In 1998, Seagal made &quot;The Patriot&quot;, another environmental thriller which was his first direct-to-video release in the United States (though it was released theatrically in most of the world). Seagal produced this film with his own money, and the film was shot on-location on and near his farm in Montana. After producing &quot;Prince of Central Park&quot;, Seagal returned to cinema screens with the release of &quot;Exit Wounds&quot; in March 2001. The film had fewer martial arts scenes than Seagal&#x27;s previous films, but it was a commercial success, taking almost $80 million worldwide. It was considered at the time to be a &quot;comeback&quot; for Seagal. However, Seagal was unable to capitalize on this success and his next two projects were both critical and commercial failures. The movie &quot;Ticker&quot;, co-starring Tom Sizemore and Dennis Hopper, was filmed in San Francisco before &quot;Exit Wounds&quot;, and went straight to DVD. &quot;Half Past Dead&quot;, starring hip hop star Ja Rule, made less than $20 million worldwide. It was ranked in a &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; editorial on the 100 worst movies of all time. Seagal was also nominated for Worst Actor at the 2002 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards and the 23rd Golden Raspberry Awards.

=== 2003–present: Direct-to-video films and television ===
Other than his role as a villain in Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;Machete&quot; (2010), almost all the films Seagal has made since the latter half of 2001 have been released direct-to-video (DTV) in North America, with some theatrical releases to other countries around the world. Seagal is credited as a producer and sometimes a writer on many of these DTV movies, which include &quot;Black Dawn&quot;, &quot;Belly of the Beast&quot;, &quot;Out of Reach&quot;, &quot;Submerged&quot;, &quot;Kill Switch&quot;, &quot;Urban Justice&quot;, &quot;Pistol Whipped&quot;, &quot;Against the Dark&quot;, &quot;Driven to Kill&quot;, &quot;A Dangerous Man&quot;, &quot;Born to Raise Hell&quot;, and &quot;The Keeper&quot;. &quot;Beyond the Law&quot; (2019) is one of Seagal&#x27;s few movies to have had a theatrical release in North America since &quot;Machete&quot;.

In 2009, A&amp;E Network premiered the reality television series &quot;Steven Seagal: Lawman&quot;, focusing on Seagal as a deputy in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. In the 2010s, Seagal&#x27;s direct-to-video films increasingly started to become ensemble pieces, with Seagal playing minor or supporting roles, despite the fact that he often received top billing. &quot;Maximum Conviction&quot;, &quot;Force of Execution&quot;, &quot;Gutshot Straight&quot;, &quot;Code of Honor&quot;, &quot;Sniper Special Ops&quot;, &quot;The Asian Connection&quot;, &quot;The Perfect Weapon&quot;, &quot;Cartels&quot;, and &quot;China Salesman&quot; all exemplify this trend. This has led some commentators to criticize Seagal for his low-effort participation in movies which heavily promote his involvement.

In 2011, Seagal produced and starred in an American television action series entitled &quot;True Justice&quot;. The series first aired on Nitro, a TV station in Spain, on May 12, 2011. It premiered in the UK on 5 USA, with the first episode broadcast July 20, 2011. The series was renewed for a second season airing on ReelzChannel. In the UK, &quot;True Justice&quot; was repackaged as a series of DVD movies, with each disc editing together two episodes.

== Influence and artistry ==
At the height of his career, Seagal was one of the biggest action movie stars in the world, and one of the most successful martial arts actors of the 1980s and 1990s, alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme. Credited with popularising aikido in film, Seagal is considered an important figure in the development and popularization of East Asian martial arts in the West. 

Many of Seagal&#x27;s films share unique elements which have become characteristic of his body of work. His characters often have an elite past affiliation with the CIA, Special Forces, or Black Ops (for example, Casey Ryback in &quot;Under Siege&quot;, a former Navy SEAL, Jack Cole in &quot;The Glimmer Man&quot;, an ex-CIA police detective, or Jonathan Cold in &quot;The Foreigner&quot; and &quot;Black Dawn&quot;, an ex-CIA Black Ops freelancer). His characters differ from those of other action movie icons by virtue of their near-invulnerability; they rarely face any significant physical threat, easily overpowering any opposition and seldom facing bodily harm or even temporary defeat. Two notable exceptions are &quot;Executive Decision&quot; (1996), in which Seagal&#x27;s character is introduced as a false protagonist only to be killed halfway through and &quot;Machete&quot; (2010), which features Seagal in a rare villainous role.

Seagal&#x27;s films also frequently reflect aspects of his personal life. His music appears in several of his films (for example, &quot;Into the Sun&quot; and &quot;Ticker&quot;, where he appears as part of a bar band), as does his fluency in other languages (he speaks Japanese in &quot;Into the Sun&quot;) and religion (Buddhism features prominently in &quot;The Glimmer Man&quot; and &quot;Belly of the Beast&quot;). His past as an aikido teacher is also incorporated into several films, for example &quot;Above the Law&quot; (which opens with a montage of real-life photos from Seagal&#x27;s own past) or &quot;Shadow Man&quot;, where he is seen giving an aikido demonstration. Several of his films also feature prominent political messages, most notably the environmentalism evident in &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot;.

While Seagal&#x27;s acting in &quot;Above the Law&quot; gained praise from the likes of Roger Ebert, Seagal has repeatedly faced criticism from both critics and fans who accuse him of playing the same character in many of his movies, as well as displaying a lack of emotional range. In fact, his typecasting has been informally referred to as &quot;Seagalism&quot; and has become the subject of much parody. In 2008, author and critic Vern published &quot;Seagalogy&quot;, a work which examines Seagal&#x27;s filmography using the framework of auteur theory. Vern describes themes of government corruption (particularly involving the CIA), environmentalism, and adoption of foreign cultures as being examples of recurrent motifs in Seagal&#x27;s films, among a variety of others. The first edition breaks Seagal&#x27;s career into four chronological &quot;eras&quot;, marked by specific differences in style and content. The 2012 updated edition adds a fifth era.

These chronological &quot;eras&quot; describe different phases of Seagal&#x27;s career, and include the &quot;Golden Era&quot; (1988–1991), the period of Seagal&#x27;s first successes, the &quot;Silver Era&quot; (1992–1997), during which Seagal saw the peak of his fame and made high-profile blockbusters, a &quot;Transitional Period&quot; (1998–2002) during which he made lower-profile or ensemble films, a lengthy &quot;direct-to-video&quot; period (his most prolific to date, 2003–2008) and, in the 2012 updated addition, a &quot;Chief Seagal&quot; period (2009–present) during which Seagal moved into television and began reflecting elements of his &quot;Steven Seagal: Lawman&quot; persona in his films.

== Other ventures ==
=== Music ===

Seagal plays the guitar and among his extensive collection are guitars previously owned by &quot;the Kings&quot;; Albert, BB, and Freddie, as well as Bo Diddley, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Buddy Guy, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Muddy Waters, and Jimi Hendrix. In 2004, he released his first album, &quot;Songs from the Crystal Cave&quot;, which has a mix of pop, world, country, and blues music. It features duets with Tony Rebel, Lt. Stichie, Lady Saw, and Stevie Wonder. The soundtrack to Seagal&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;Into the Sun&quot; features several songs from the album. One of his album tracks, &quot;Girl It&#x27;s Alright&quot;, was also released as a single in several countries alongside an accompanying music video. Seagal&#x27;s second album, titled &quot;Mojo Priest&quot;, was released in April 2006 and spawned a concert tour. Thom Jurek of AllMusic panned the album, rating it 1.5 stars out of 5 and stating that Seagal&#x27;s guitar playing &quot;rarely rises above bar band pedigree&quot; and that &quot;all of this music takes itself so seriously that it borders on delusional excess.&quot;

=== Law enforcement work ===
Seagal has been a Reserve Deputy Chief in the Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, Sheriff&#x27;s Office. In the late 1980s, after teaching the deputies martial arts, unarmed combat, and marksmanship, then-sheriff Harry Lee (1932–2007) asked Seagal to join the force. Seagal&#x27;s rank in Louisiana was ceremonial. &quot;Steven Seagal: Lawman&quot;, a series which follows his work in the Jefferson Parish Sheriff&#x27;s Office, premiered on A&amp;E on December 2, 2009. Seagal stated that &quot;I&#x27;ve decided to work with A&amp;E on this series now because I believe it&#x27;s important to show the nation all the positive work being accomplished here in Louisiana—to see the passion and commitment that comes from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff&#x27;s Office in this post-Katrina environment.&quot; The series premiere drew 3.6 million viewers, ranking as best season opener for any original A&amp;E series ever.

On April 14, 2010, the series was suspended by Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand due to a sexual trafficking lawsuit filed against Seagal. The suit was later dropped. A&amp;E resumed the show for the second season, which began on October 6, 2010. Production on Season 3 started in February 2011, with a change of location from Louisiana to Maricopa County, Arizona. Two episodes were scheduled to be aired, beginning on January 4, 2012. Shortly before the episodes were to be aired, Season 3 was suspended, with no explanations given. Season 3 premiered on January 2, 2014, but the show was not renewed for a fourth season. In October 2011, Seagal was sworn in as the Sheriff department&#x27;s deputy sheriff of Hudspeth County, Texas, a law department responsible for patrolling a 98-mile stretch of the Texas-Mexico border.

=== Business ventures ===
In 1997, Seagal was to be featured in an action video game for the Nintendo 64 and the original PlayStation called &quot;Deadly Honor&quot;, but it was cancelled for undisclosed reasons in its beta phase of development. In 2005, Seagal Enterprises began to market an energy drink known as &quot;Steven Seagal&#x27;s Lightning Bolt&quot;, but it has since been discontinued. Seagal has also marketed an aftershave called &quot;Scent of Action&quot;, and a range of knives and weapons. In 2013, Seagal joined newly formed Russian firearms manufacturer ORSIS, representing the company in both a promotional capacity as well as lobbying for the easement of US import restrictions on Russian sporting firearms.

== Personal life ==
Seagal has an extensive sword collection, and at one time had a custom gun made for him once a month. Seagal owns a home in the Mandeville Canyon section of Los Angeles, and a home in Louisiana. He formerly lived on Staten Island in New York. Seagal is a Buddhist and in February 1997, Lama Penor Rinpoche from Palyul monastery announced that Seagal was a tulku, and specifically the reincarnation of Chungdrag Dorje, a 17th-century terton (treasure revealer) of the Nyingma, the oldest sect of Tibetan Buddhism.
Seagal holds citizenships in three countries: the United States, Serbia, and Russia. Born in the United States, he possesses &quot;jus soli&quot; U.S. citizenship. He was granted Serbian citizenship on January 11, 2016, following several visits to the country, and has been asked to teach aikido to the Serbian Special Forces.

Seagal was granted Russian citizenship on November 3, 2016; according to government spokesman Dmitry Peskov, &quot;He was asking quite insistently and over a lengthy period to be granted citizenship.&quot; Various media outlets have cited Seagal and President Vladimir Putin as friends and Seagal stated that he &quot;would like to consider [Putin] as a brother&quot;, Putin bestowed the Russian award of Order of Friendship medal, upon Seagal in 2023; Peskov has said of Putin: &quot;he&#x27;s definitely seen some of his movies.&quot;
While in Japan, Seagal married his first wife, Miyako Fujitani, the daughter of an aikido instructor. With Fujitani, he had a son, actor and model Kentaro Seagal, and a daughter, writer and actress Ayako Fujitani. Seagal left Miyako to move back to the United States. During this time, he met actress and model Kelly LeBrock, with whom he began an affair that led to Fujitani granting him a divorce. Seagal was briefly married to actress Adrienne La Russa in 1984, but that marriage was annulled the same year over concerns that his divorce had not yet been finalized. LeBrock gave birth to Seagal&#x27;s daughter Annaliza in early 1987. Seagal and LeBrock married in September 1987 and their son Dominic was born in June 1990. Their daughter Arissa was born in 1993. The following year, LeBrock filed for divorce citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;.

Seagal is married to Mongolian Erdenetuya Batsukh (), better known as &quot;Elle&quot;. They have one son together, Kunzang. From an early age, Elle trained as a dancer at the Children&#x27;s Palace in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. After her graduation from high school and the Children&#x27;s Palace, she pursued a career as a professional dancer. She won a number of dancing contests and was considered the top female dancer in Mongolia, excelling at ballroom dancing in particular. Elle first met Seagal in 2001, when she worked as his interpreter during his visit to Mongolia. Seagal has seven children from four relationships, two grandchildren by his eldest son, Kentaro and one granddaughter by his daughter Ayako Fujitani. In addition to his biological offspring, Seagal is the guardian of Yabshi Pan Rinzinwangmo, the only child of the 10th Panchen Lama of Tibet. When she studied in the United States, Seagal was her minder and bodyguard.

== Political views and activism ==
Seagal lent his voice as a narrator for an activist film project, &quot;Medicine Lake Video&quot;. The project seeks to protect sacred tribal ground near Seagal&#x27;s ranch in Siskiyou County. He also wrote an open letter to the leadership of Thailand in 2003, urging them to enact a law to prevent the torture of baby elephants. In 1999, Seagal was awarded a PETA Humanitarian Award.


In a March 2014 interview with &quot;Rossiyskaya Gazeta&quot;, Seagal described Vladimir Putin as &quot;one of the great living world leaders&quot;. He expressed support for the annexation of Crimea by Russia. In July 2014, following calls for a boycott, Seagal was dropped from the lineup of the August Blues Festival in Haapsalu, Estonia. The Estonian musician Tõnis Mägi, the minister of Foreign Affairs, Urmas Paet, and Parliament&#x27;s Foreign Affairs chairman Marko Mihkelson had all condemned inviting Seagal into the country, with Paet saying, &quot;Steven Seagal has tried to actively participate in politics during the past few months and has done it in a way which is unacceptable to the majority of the world that respects democracy and the rule of law.&quot;

In August 2014, Seagal appeared at a Night Wolves-organized show in Sevastopol, Crimea, supporting the Crimean annexation and depicting Ukraine as a country controlled by fascists. On November 3, Seagal was granted Russian citizenship by Putin. His views on Ukraine and Russian citizenship caused Ukraine to ban him from entering the country because he &quot;committed socially dangerous actions&quot;. Seagal visited the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2015 and met with the country&#x27;s long-time president, Ilham Aliyev. Seagal has expressed support for Azerbaijan&#x27;s territorial integrity and dispute with neighboring Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

Seagal spoke out against the protests during the United States national anthem by professional athletes, stating, &quot;I believe in free speech, I believe that everyone&#x27;s entitled to their own opinion, but I don&#x27;t agree that they should hold the United States of America or the world hostage by taking a venue where people are tuning in to watch a football game and imposing their political views.&quot; He also expressed skepticism of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Not long after this, former two time World boxing heavyweight champion George Foreman publicly challenged Seagal to an official ten-round MMA match in Las Vegas, which Seagal promptly declined.

In 2017, Seagal collaborated with a former chair of the Arizona Republican Party, Tom Morrissey, in writing a self-published conspiracy thriller novel, &quot;The Way of the Shadow Wolves: The Deep State And The Hijacking Of America,&quot; which featured a Tohono Shadow Wolf tracker working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to foil a plot by Mexican drug cartels and the &quot;deep state&quot; to smuggle in Islamist terrorists to the United States through the U.S.–Mexico border.

In October 2017, Seagal met with Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte while scouting locations in Manila for a possible film. During the visit, Seagal flashed Duterte&#x27;s signature fist. In 2021, Seagal gave a katana to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro as Russia&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Ministry special envoy while visiting Canaima National Park. Maduro referred to Seagal as &quot;my brother.&quot; On May 30, 2021, the pro-Kremlin systemic opposition party A Just Russia — Patriots — For Truth announced that Seagal had received an official membership card to the party.

In March 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Seagal visited Moscow where he organized his birthday party, attended by many people connected to Vladimir Putin, including some affected by international sanctions. This has been criticized as a dissenting action that came amidst the growing international boycott of Russia. In August 2022, he visited Olenivka in Donetsk Oblast, the site of the Olenivka prison massacre, with Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic leader Denis Pushilin, who claimed that Seagal was filming a documentary about the war in Donbas. Seagal also met with Leonid Slutsky. On February 27, 2023, he received the Russian Order of Friendship from Vladimir Putin for his &quot;major contribution to the development of international cultural and humanitarian cooperation&quot;.

==Controversies==
=== Allegations and lawsuits ===
In May 1991 (during the filming of &quot;Out for Justice&quot;), Warner Brothers employees Raenne Malone, Nicole Selinger, and Christine Keeve accused Seagal of sexual harassment. In return for remaining silent, Malone and another woman received around $50,000 each in an out-of-court settlement. Around the same time, at least four actresses said that Seagal had made sexual advances, typically during late-night &quot;casting sessions&quot;. In another incident, Jenny McCarthy said that Seagal asked her to undress during an audition for &quot;Under Siege 2: Dark Territory&quot;.

In 1995, Seagal was charged with employment discrimination, sexual harassment, and breach of contract. Cheryl Shuman filed a case against Seagal, accusing him of threatening and beating her during the filming of &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot;. In August 1995, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki dismissed the case, calling the claims &quot;repetitive and unintelligible&quot;.

On April 12, 2010, 23-year-old Kayden Nguyen filed a lawsuit against Seagal in a Los Angeles County Superior Court, requesting more than one million dollars in damages. In her suit, Nguyen alleged Seagal engaged in sexual harassment, the illegal trafficking of females for sex, failure to prevent sexual harassment, and wrongful termination. Seagal denied the allegations, but his reality show &quot;Steven Seagal: Lawman&quot; was suspended while his attorneys resolved the case. On July 14, 2010, three months after Nguyen filed her suit, she withdrew her claim without explanation.

On August 30, 2011, Jesus Sanchez Llovera filed a lawsuit against Seagal over his part in a Maricopa county police raid with heavy weapons (notably including an army surplus tank) of Llovera&#x27;s residence for suspicion of cockfighting. The incident was taped for Seagal&#x27;s A&amp;E reality show &quot;Steven Seagal: Lawman&quot;. Llovera was seeking $100,000 for damages caused during the raid and a letter of apology from Seagal to Llovera&#x27;s children for the death of their family pet. Llovera claimed that his 11-month-old puppy was shot and killed during the raid. Llovera failed to file court-ordered paperwork after his attorney withdrew from the case and the lawsuit was dismissed in January 2013.

In 2017, actress Portia de Rossi accused Seagal of sexually harassing her during a movie audition. De Rossi alleged that during an audition in Seagal&#x27;s office, he told her &quot;how important it was to have chemistry off-screen&quot; before unzipping his pants. On an April 18 appearance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, Katherine Heigl alleged on the final day of shooting for &quot;Under Siege 2&quot; that Seagal told her that he had girlfriends the same age as the 16-year-old Heigl. Kimmel responded by displaying a photo from the film&#x27;s promotional tour showing Seagal&#x27;s hand on Heigl&#x27;s chest while they posed for a photo. 
On November 9, 2017, Dutch model Faviola Dadis posted a statement on her Instagram account stating that she also had been sexually assaulted by Seagal years earlier.

On January 15, 2018, actress Rachel Grant publicly accused Seagal of sexually assaulting her in 2002, during pre-production on his direct-to-video film, &quot;Out for a Kill&quot; (2003), stating that she lost her job on the film after the incident. In February 2018, the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s office acknowledged that it was reviewing a potential sex-abuse case involving Seagal.

In March 2018, Regina Simons publicly claimed that in 1993, when she was 18, Seagal raped her at his home when she arrived for what she thought was a wrap party for the movie &quot;On Deadly Ground.&quot; In September 2018, Los Angeles prosecutors refused to charge the actor based on Regina Simons accusations, due to California&#x27;s statute of limitations. Two months later, the case involving the actress Rachel Grant was dismissed for the same reasons.

=== Victim of attempted extortion ===
Seagal became embroiled in a legal case involving film producer Julius R. Nasso after Nasso attempted to extort Seagal. Nasso produced seven of Seagal&#x27;s films beginning with &quot;Marked for Death&quot; in 1990. The two &quot;became best friends&quot;, according to Seagal, and formed Seagal/Nasso Productions together. Their relationship became strained, however, and their partnership ended in 2000. Believing that Seagal owed him $3 million in compensation for backing out of a four-film deal, Nasso enlisted members of the Gambino crime family to threaten Seagal in an attempt to recoup money Nasso allegedly lost.

Gambino family captain Anthony Ciccone first visited Seagal in Toronto during the filming of &quot;Exit Wounds&quot; in October 2000. In January 2001, Primo Cassarino and other gangsters picked up Seagal by car to bring him to a meeting with Ciccone at a Brooklyn restaurant. At the meeting, Ciccone reportedly told Seagal that he had a choice of making four promised movies with Nasso or paying Nasso a penalty of $150,000 per movie, and that if Seagal refused, Ciccone would kill him.

Seagal, who later claimed that he brought a handgun to the meeting, was able to stall Ciccone and escape the meeting unharmed. In the spring of 2001, Seagal sought out another mobster, Genovese crime family captain Angelo Prisco, to act as a &quot;peacemaker&quot;. He visited Prisco in prison at Rahway, New Jersey and paid Prisco&#x27;s lawyer $10,000.

On March 17, 2003, Cassarino, Ciccone and others were convicted of labor racketeering, extortion, and 63 other counts under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Seagal testified for the prosecution about the mobsters&#x27; extortion attempt. Nasso pleaded guilty to the charge of extortion conspiracy in August 2003. In February 2004, he was sentenced to a year and a day in prison, fined $75,000 and ordered to take mental health counselling on release from jail. In January 2008, Nasso agreed to drop a $60 million lawsuit against Seagal for an alleged breach of contract when the two settled out of court.

===Conflicts with stuntmen===
Seagal has been accused by former stunt performers who have worked with him, including Kane Hodder, Stephen Quadros, and Gene LeBell, of intentionally hitting stuntmen during scenes. Additionally, while serving as stunt coordinator for &quot;Out for Justice&quot;, LeBell allegedly got into an on-set altercation with Seagal over his mistreatment of some of the film&#x27;s stunt performers. After the actor claimed that, due to his aikido training, he was &quot;immune&quot; to being choked unconscious, LeBell offered Seagal the opportunity to prove it. LeBell is said to have placed his arms around Seagal&#x27;s neck, and once Seagal said &quot;go&quot;, proceeded to choke him unconscious, with Seagal losing control of his bowels. Seagal bodyguard and stuntman Steven Lambert stated he was present and said that a confrontation did happen, during which Seagal elbowed LeBell before he could lock the hold on Seagal, after which LeBell flipped Seagal.

LeBell was requested to confirm the on-set incident publicly in an interview with Ariel Helwani in 2012, but he avoided answering the question, albeit implying that it was true. He was quoted as &quot;When we had a little altercation or difference of opinion, there were thirty stuntmen and cameramen that were watching. Sometimes Steven has a tendency to cheese off the wrong people, and you can get hurt doing that.&quot;

On the other hand, when Seagal was asked about the incident, he directly denied the allegations, calling LeBell a &quot;sick, pathological scumbag liar&quot;, and offered the name of a witness who could prove LeBell had fabricated the entire story. The claim garnered a heated response from LeBell&#x27;s trainee Ronda Rousey, who said that Seagal was the one lying, and declared &quot;If [Seagal] says anything bad about Gene to my face, I&#x27;d make him crap his pants a second time.&quot;

Authentic or not, the reports of this incident led LeBell to be counted in 1992 as an additional member of Robert Wall&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot;, a group of martial artists willing to answer to a public challenge made by Seagal. LeBell however declined to participate, revealing the feud with Seagal was hurting him professionally. He did however criticize Seagal for his treatment of stuntmen, and left open the possibility of a professional fight if Seagal wanted to do it.

Allegations of mistreatment towards stuntmen have continued throughout Seagal&#x27;s later career, with both stuntman Peter Harris Kent (Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s stunt double) and Mike Leeder publicly criticizing his on-set antics. Actor John Leguizamo also claimed that during rehearsals on &quot;Executive Decision&quot;, in retaliation for laughing at him, Seagal caught him off guard and knocked him into a brick wall. Michael Jai White, who acted with him in a number of movies, stated that he routinely hit stunt men, and that he was known for it. He said they just accepted it. However, he stated that Seagal never hit him.

<doc id="67405" wikidata="Q194256" url="?curid=67405" title="Great Red Spot">
<text>The Great Red Spot is a persistent high-pressure region in the atmosphere of Jupiter, producing an anticyclonic storm that is the largest in the Solar System. It is the most recognizable feature on Jupiter, owing to its red-orange color whose origin is still unknown. Located 22 degrees south of Jupiter&#x27;s equator, it produces wind-speeds up to 432 km/h (268 mph). It was first observed in September 1831, with 60 recorded observations between then and 1878, when continuous observations began. A similar spot was observed from 1665 to 1713; if this is the same storm, it has existed for at least 360 years, but a study from 2024 suggests this is not the case.

==Observation history==

=== First observations ===
The Great Red Spot may have existed before 1665, but it could be that the present spot was first seen only in 1830, and was well studied only after a prominent appearance in 1879. The storm that was seen in the 17th century may have been different from the storm that exists today. A long gap separates its period of current study after 1830 from the 17th century discovery. It is unknown whether the original spot dissipated and reformed, whether it faded away, or whether observers simply failed to study and record it.

The first sighting of the Great Red Spot is often credited to Robert Hooke, who described a spot on the planet in May 1664. However, it is likely that Hooke&#x27;s spot was not only in another belt altogether (the North Equatorial Belt, as opposed to the current Great Red Spot in the South Equatorial Belt), but also that it was in the shadow of a transiting moon, most likely Callisto. Far more convincing is Giovanni Cassini&#x27;s description of a &quot;permanent spot&quot; the following year. With fluctuations in visibility, Cassini&#x27;s spot was observed from 1665 to 1713, but the 48-year observational gap makes the identity of the two spots inconclusive. Because of the older spot&#x27;s shorter observational history and slower motion than the modern spot, it is difficult to conclude that they are the same.

A minor mystery concerns a Jovian spot depicted in a 1711 canvas by Donato Creti, which is exhibited in the Vatican. Part of a series of panels in which different (magnified) heavenly bodies serve as backdrops for various Italian scenes, and all overseen by the astronomer Eustachio Manfredi for accuracy, Creti&#x27;s painting is the first known depiction of the Great Red Spot as red (albeit raised to the Jovian northern hemisphere due to an optical inversion inherent to the era&#x27;s telescopes). No Jovian feature was explicitly described in writing as red before the late 19th century.

The Great Red Spot has been frequently observed since 5 September 1831, with over 60 observations recorded by 1879, when it came into popular prominence. Since then, it has been under continuous observation.

A 2024 study of historical observations suggests that the &quot;permanent spot&quot; observed from 1665 to 1713 may not be the same as the modern Great Red Spot observed since 1831. It is suggested that the original spot disappeared, and later another spot formed, which is the one seen today.

===Late 20th and 21st centuries===
On 25 February 1979, when the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; spacecraft was from Jupiter, it transmitted the first detailed image of the Great Red Spot. Cloud details as small as across were visible. The colorful, wavy cloud pattern seen to the left (west) of the Red Spot is a region of extraordinarily complex and variable wave motion.

In the 21st century, the major diameter of the Great Red Spot has been observed to be shrinking. In 2004 its length was about half that of a century earlier, when it reached a size of , about three times the diameter of Earth. At the present rate of reduction, it will become circular by 2040. It is not known how long the spot will last, or whether the change is a result of periodic fluctuations. In 2019, the spot began &quot;flaking&quot; at its edge, with fragments of the storm spinning off and dissipating. The shrinking and &quot;flaking&quot; fueled speculation from some astronomers that the spot could dissipate within decades. However, other astronomers believe the apparent size of the spot reflects its cloud coverage and not the size of the underlying vortex, and also that the flaking events can be explained by interactions with other cyclones or anticyclones, including incomplete absorptions of smaller systems; this might mean that the Great Red Spot is not in danger of dissipating.

A smaller spot, designated Oval BA, which formed in March 2000 from the merging of three white ovals, has turned reddish in color. Astronomers have named it the &quot;Little Red Spot&quot; or &quot;Red Jr.&quot; As of 5 June 2006, the Great Red Spot and Oval BA appeared to be approaching convergence. The storms pass each other about every two years, but the passings of 2002 and 2004 were of little significance. Amy Simon-Miller, of the Goddard Space Flight Center, predicted the storms would have their closest passing on 4 July 2006. She worked with Imke de Pater and Phil Marcus of UC Berkeley as well as a team of professional astronomers beginning in April 2006 to study the storms using the Hubble Space Telescope; on 20 July 2006, the two storms were photographed passing each other by the Gemini Observatory without converging. In May 2008, a third storm turned red.

The &quot;Juno&quot; spacecraft, which entered into a polar orbit around Jupiter in 2016, flew over the Great Red Spot upon its close approach to Jupiter on 11 July 2017, taking several images of the storm from a distance of about above the surface. Over the duration of the &quot;Juno&quot; mission, the spacecraft continued to study the composition and evolution of Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere, especially its Great Red Spot.

The Great Red Spot should not be confused with the Great Dark Spot, a feature observed near the northern pole of Jupiter in 2000 with the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; spacecraft. There is also a feature in the atmosphere of Neptune called the Great Dark Spot. The latter feature was imaged by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in 1989 and may have been an atmospheric hole rather than a storm. It disappeared by 1994, although a similar spot had appeared farther to the north.

==Mechanical dynamics==

Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot rotates counterclockwise, with a period of about 4.5 Earth days, or 11 Jovian days, as of 2008. Measuring in width as of 3 April 2017, the Great Red Spot is 1.3 times the diameter of Earth. The cloud-tops of this storm are about above the surrounding cloud-tops. The storm has continued for centuries because there is no planetary surface (only a mantle of hydrogen) to cause friction; circulating atmospheric eddies persist because there is nothing to oppose their angular momentum.

Infrared data has long indicated that the Great Red Spot is colder (and thus higher in altitude) than most of the other clouds on the planet. The upper atmosphere above the storm, however, has substantially higher temperatures than the rest of the planet. Acoustic waves rising from the turbulence of the storm below have been proposed as an explanation for the heating of this region. The acoustic waves travel vertically up to a height of above the storm where they break in the upper atmosphere, converting wave energy into heat. This creates a region of upper atmosphere that is —several hundred kelvins warmer than the rest of the planet at this altitude. The effect is described as like &quot;crashing [...] ocean waves on a beach&quot;.

Careful tracking of atmospheric features revealed the Great Red Spot&#x27;s counterclockwise circulation as far back as 1966, observations dramatically confirmed by the first time-lapse movies from the &quot;Voyager&quot; fly-bys. The spot is confined by a modest eastward jet stream to its south and a very strong westward one to its north. Though winds around the edge of the spot peak at about , currents inside it seem stagnant, with little inflow or outflow. The rotation of the spot has slowed with time, perhaps as a direct result of its steady reduction in size.

The Great Red Spot&#x27;s latitude has been stable for the duration of good observational records, typically varying by about a degree. Its longitude, however, is subject to constant variation, including a 90-day longitudinal oscillation with an amplitude of ~1°. Because Jupiter&#x27;s gaseous body does not rotate uniformly at all latitudes, astronomers have defined three different systems for defining longitude. System II is used for latitudes of more than 10 degrees and was originally based on the average rotational period of the Great Red Spot (9h 55m 42s). Despite this, however, the spot has &quot;lapped&quot; the planet in System II at least 10 times since the early 19th century. Its drift rate has changed dramatically over the years and has been linked to the brightness of the South Equatorial Belt and the presence or absence of a South Tropical Disturbance.

== Internal depth and structure ==
Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot (GRS) is an elliptical shaped anticyclone, occurring at 22 degrees below the equator, in Jupiter&#x27;s southern hemisphere. The largest anticyclonic storm (~16,000 km) in our solar system, little is known about its internal depth and structure. Visible imaging and cloud-tracking from in-situ observation determined the velocity and vorticity of the GRS, which is located in a thin anticyclonic ring at 70–85% of the radius and is located along Jupiter&#x27;s fastest westward moving jet stream. During NASA&#x27;s 2016 Juno mission, gravity signature and thermal infrared data were obtained that offered insight into the structural dynamics and depth of the GRS. During July 2017, the Juno spacecraft conducted a second pass of the GRS to collect Microwave Radiometer (MWR) scans of the GRS to determine how far the GRS extended toward the surface of the condensed H2O layer. These MWR scans suggested that the GRS vertical depth extended to about 240 km below cloud level, with an estimated drop in atmospheric pressure to 100 bar. Two methods of analysis that constrain the data collected were the mascon approach, which found a depth of ~290 km, and the Slepian approach showing wind extending to ~310 km. These methods, along with gravity signature MWR data, suggest that the GRS zonal winds still increase at a rate of 50% of the velocity of the viable cloud level, before the wind decay starts at lower levels. This rate of wind decay and gravity data suggest the depth of the GRS is between 200 and 500 km.

Galileo and Cassini&#x27;s thermal infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the GRS were conducted during 1995–2008, in order to find evidence of thermal inhomogeneities within the internal structure vortex of the GRS. Previous thermal infrared temperature maps from the Voyager, Galileo, and Cassini missions suggested the GRS is a structure of an anticyclonic vortex with a cold core within a upwelling warmer annulus; this data shows a gradient in the temperature of the GRS. Better understanding of Jupiter&#x27;s atmospheric temperature, aerosol particle opacity, and ammonia gas composition was provided by thermal-IR imaging: a direct correlation of the visible cloud layers reactions, thermal gradient and compositional mapping to observational data were collected over decades. During December 2000, high spatial resolution images from Galileo, of an atmospheric turbulent area to the northwest of the GRS, showed a thermal contrast between the warmest region of the anticyclone and regions to the east and west of the GRS.

The vertical temperature of the structure of the GRS is constrained between the 100–600 mbar range, with the vertical temperature of the GRS core at approximately 400 mbar of pressure being 1.0–1.5 K, much warmer than regions of the GRS to the east–west, and 3.0–3.5 K warmer than regions to the north–south of the structure&#x27;s edge. This structure is consistent with the data collected by the VISIR (VLT Mid-Infrared Imager Spectrometer on the ESO Very Large Telescope) imaging obtained in 2006; this revealed that the GRS was physically present at a wide range of altitudes that occur within the atmospheric pressure range of 80–600 mbar, and confirms the thermal infrared mapping result. To develop a model of the internal structure of the GRS, the Cassini instrument Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) and ground based spatial imaging mapped the composition of the phosphine and ammonia aerosols (PH3, NH3) and para-hydroxybenzoic acid within the anticyclonic circulation of the GRS. The images that were collected from the CIRS and ground-based imaging trace the vertical motion in the Jovian atmosphere by PH3 and NH3 spectra.

The highest concentrations of PH3 and NH3 were found to the north of the GRS peripheral rotation. They aided in determining the southward jet movement and showed evidence of an increase in altitude of the column of aerosols with pressures ranging from 200–500 mbar. However, the NH3 composition data shows that there is a major depletion of NH3 below the visible cloud layer at the southern peripheral ring of the GRS; this lower opacity is relative to a narrow band of atmospheric subsidence. The low mid-IR aerosol opacity, along with the temperature gradients, the altitude difference, and the vertical movement of the zonal winds, are involved with the development and sustainability of the vorticity. The stronger atmospheric subsidence and compositional asymmetries of the GRS suggest that the structure exhibits a degree of tilt from the northern edge to the southern edge of the structure. The GRS depth and internal structure has been constantly changing over decades; however there is still no logical reason that it is 200–500 km in depth, but the jet streams that supply the force that powers the GRS vortex are well below the structure base.

==Color and composition==
It is not known what causes the Great Red Spot&#x27;s reddish color. Hypotheses supported by laboratory experiments suppose that it may be caused by chemical products created from the solar ultraviolet irradiation of ammonium hydrosulfide and the organic compound acetylene, which produces a reddish material—likely complex organic compounds called tholins. The high altitude of the compounds may also contribute to the coloring.

The Great Red Spot varies greatly in hue, from almost brick-red to pale salmon or even white. The spot occasionally disappears, becoming evident only through the Red Spot Hollow, which is its location in the South Equatorial Belt (SEB). Its visibility is apparently coupled to the SEB; when the belt is bright white, the spot tends to be dark, and when it is dark, the spot is usually light. These periods when the spot is dark or light occur at irregular intervals; from 1947 to 1997, the spot was darkest in the periods 1961–1966, 1968–1975, 1989–1990, and 1992–1993.

<doc id="67408" wikidata="Q162483" url="?curid=67408" title="Maamme">
<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; (), known by its original Swedish title as &quot;&#x27;&quot; () and in English as &quot;&quot;, is the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem of Finland. The music was composed by the German immigrant Fredrik Pacius, with original Swedish lyrics by Johan Ludvig Runeberg. It was first performed on 13 May 1848. Originally, it was written for the 500th anniversary of Porvoo, and for that occasion it was Runeberg himself who wrote the music.

The melody of &quot;Maamme&quot; is also used for two other anthems: the Estonian anthem &quot;Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm&quot; (&quot;My Fatherland, My Happiness and Joy&quot;) and the Livonian anthem &quot;Min izāmō&quot; (&quot;My Fatherland&quot;).

==History==


The original poem, written in 1846 but not printed until 1848, had 11 stanzas and formed the prologue to the verse cycle &quot;The Tales of Ensign Stål&quot; (&quot;Fänrik Ståhls sägner&quot;), a classic example of Romantic nationalism. The current Finnish language text is usually attributed to the 1889 translation of &quot;Ensign Stål&quot; by Paavo Cajander, but in fact, originates from the 1867 translation by Julius Krohn.

In the 1880s and the 1920s, there were more attempts to replace it with a Finnish language version but these ceased by the 1930s. Some Finns have proposed that the Finnish national anthem be set as &quot;Finlandia&quot; by Jean Sibelius, with lyrics by V.A. Koskenniemi (Finnish) and Joel Rundt (Swedish).

It is said that Pacius composed the tune in four days. It was popular throughout the 19th century but established its current position only after Pacius&#x27; death.

There is no law regarding an official national anthem in Finland, in the way the coat of arms and flag of Finland are legally defined. Instead, its position has been established gradually by convention over the years. In 2018, &quot;Maamme&quot; was described by the Government of Finland as the &quot;Finnish national anthem&quot;.

Even though &quot;Maamme&quot; has become established as the &quot;de facto&quot; anthem, its status has still been debated from time to time. It has been suggested that the status of &quot;Maamme&quot; as the national anthem should be legalised. For example, opposing legislative initiatives were made in 2003 by the Finnish Parliament to make &quot;Maamme&quot; and the Finlandia Hymn the official national anthem. In 2014, there was a citizens&#x27; initiative about choosing the Finlandia Hymn as the national anthem, and in 2016 members of the National Coalition Party began campaigning to stop using &quot;Maamme&quot; in favour of the Finlandia Hymn, however, opinions were not unanimous in the party, and the campaign fell short of its goal.

Despite the lack of official status, in usage, &quot;Maamme&quot; fills the function of a national anthem in the same way as in many other countries. For example, it is played during state visits, and used to represent Finland at international sporting fixtures.

==Lyrics==
The original lyrics consist of eleven verses, but it is customary to only sing the first verse and the last verse unless the people gathered are mixed Finnish- and Swedish-speaking. In the latter case, three verses are sung: the first in Finnish, the first in Swedish and the last in Finnish.

<text>The Boeing 707 is an early American long-range narrow-body airliner, the first jetliner developed and produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

Developed from the Boeing 367-80 prototype first flown in 1954, the initial first flew on December 20, 1957.
Pan Am began regular 707 service on October 26, 1958.

With versions produced until 1979, the 707 is a swept wing quadjet with podded engines. Its larger fuselage cross-section allowed six-abreast economy seating, retained in the later 720, 727, 737, and 757 models.
Although it was not the first commercial jetliner in service, the 707 was the first to be widespread, and is often credited with beginning the Jet Age. It dominated passenger air-transport in the 1960s, and remained common through the 1970s, on domestic, transcontinental, and transatlantic flights, as well as cargo and military applications. It established Boeing as a dominant airliner manufacturer with its 7x7 series.

The initial, was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojet engines.
The shortened, long-range and the more powerful entered service in 1959.
The longer-range, heavier 707-300/400 series has larger wings and is stretched slightly by .
Powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A turbojets, the 707-320 entered service in 1959, and the with Rolls-Royce Conway turbofans in 1960.

The 720, a lighter short-range variant, was also introduced in 1960. Powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D turbofans, the 707-120B debuted in 1961 and the 707-320B in 1962. The 707-120B typically flew 137 passengers in two classes over , and could accommodate 174 in one class. With 141 passengers in two classes, the 707-320/420 could fly and the 707-320B up to . The 707-320C convertible passenger-freighter model entered service in 1963, and passenger 707s have been converted to freighter configurations. Military derivatives include the E-3 Sentry airborne reconnaissance aircraft and the C-137 Stratoliner VIP transport. In total, 865 Boeing 707s were produced and delivered, not including 154 Boeing 720s.

==Development==

===Model 367-80 origins===


During and after World War II, Boeing was known for its military aircraft. The company had produced innovative and important bombers, from the B-17 Flying Fortress and B-29 Superfortress to the jet-powered B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress, but its commercial aircraft were not as successful as those from Douglas Aircraft and other competitors. As Douglas and Lockheed dominated the postwar air transport boom, the demand for Boeing&#x27;s offering, the 377 Stratocruiser, quickly faded with only 56 examples sold and no new orders as the 1940s drew to a close. That venture had netted the company a $15 million loss. During 1949 and 1950, Boeing embarked on studies for a new jet transport and saw advantages with a design aimed at both military and civilian markets. Aerial refueling was becoming a standard technique for military aircraft, with over 800 KC-97 Stratofreighters on order. The KC-97 was not ideally suited for operations with the USAF&#x27;s new fleets of jet-powered fighters and bombers; this was where Boeing&#x27;s new design would win military orders.

As the first of a new generation of American passenger jets, Boeing wanted the aircraft&#x27;s model number to emphasize the difference from its previous propeller-driven aircraft, which bore 300-series numbers. The 400-, 500- and 600-series were already used by their missiles and other products, so Boeing decided that the jets would bear 700-series numbers, and the first would be the 707. The marketing personnel at Boeing chose 707 because they thought it was more appealing than 700.

The project was enabled by the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojet engine, the civilian version of the J57 that yielded much more power than the previous generation of jet engines and was proving itself with the B-52. Freed from the design constraints imposed by limitations of late-1940s jet engines, developing a robust, safe, and high-capacity jet aircraft was within reach for Boeing. Boeing studied numerous wing and engine layouts for its new transport/tanker, some of which were based on the B-47 and C-97, before settling on the 367-80 &quot;Dash 80&quot; quadjet prototype aircraft. Less than two years elapsed from project launch in 1952 to rollout on May 14, 1954, with the first Dash 80 flying on July 15, 1954. The prototype was a proof-of-concept aircraft for both military and civilian use. The United States Air Force was the first customer, using it as the basis for the KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refueling and cargo aircraft.

Whether the passenger 707 would be profitable was far from certain. At the time, nearly all of Boeing&#x27;s revenue came from military contracts. In a demonstration flight over Lake Washington outside Seattle, on August 7, 1955, test pilot Tex Johnston performed a barrel roll in the 367-80 prototype. Although he justified his unauthorized action to Bill Allen, then president of Boeing, as selling the airplane with a 1 &#x27;g&#x27; maneuver he was told not to do it again.

The wide fuselage of the Dash 80 was large enough for four-abreast (two-plus-two) seating like the Stratocruiser. Answering customers&#x27; demands and under Douglas competition, Boeing soon realized this would not provide a viable payload, so it widened the fuselage to to allow five-abreast seating and use of the KC-135&#x27;s tooling. Douglas Aircraft had launched its DC-8 with a fuselage width of . The airlines liked the extra space and six-abreast seating, so Boeing increased the 707&#x27;s width again to compete, this time to .

===Production and testing===
The first flight of the first-production 707-120 took place on December 20, 1957, and FAA certification followed on September 18, 1958. Both test pilots Joseph John &quot;Tym&quot; Tymczyszyn and James R. Gannett were awarded the first Iven C. Kincheloe Award for the test flights that led to certification. A number of changes were incorporated into the production models from the prototype. A Krueger flap was installed along the leading edge between the inner and outer engines on early 707-120 and -320 models. This was in response to de Havilland Comet overrun accidents which occurred after over-rotating on take-off. Wing stall would also occur on the 707 with over-rotation so the leading-edge flaps were added to prevent stalling even with the tail dragging on the runway.

===Further developments===

The initial standard model was the 707-120 with JT3C turbojet engines. Qantas ordered a shorter-bodied version called the 707-138, which was a -120 with six fuselage frames removed, three in front of the wings, and three aft. The frames in the 707 were set apart, so this resulted in a shortening of to a length of . With the maximum takeoff weight the same as that of the -120 (), the -138 was able to fly the longer routes that Qantas needed. Braniff International Airways ordered the higher-thrust version with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A engines, the 707-220. The final major derivative was the 707-320, which featured an extended-span wing and JT4A engines, while the 707-420 was the same as the -320, but with Conway turbofan engines.

Though initially fitted with turbojet engines, the dominant engine for the Boeing 707 family was the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D, a turbofan variant of the JT3C with lower fuel consumption and higher thrust. JT3D-engined 707s and 720s were denoted with a &quot;B&quot; suffix. While many 707-120Bs and -720Bs were conversions of existing JT3C-powered machines, 707-320Bs were available only as newly built aircraft, as they had a stronger structure to support a maximum takeoff weight increased by , along with modifications to the wing. The 707-320B series enabled nonstop westbound flights from Europe to the West Coast of the United States and from the US to Japan.

The final 707 variant was the 707-320C, (C for &quot;Convertible&quot;), which had a large fuselage door for cargo. It had a revised wing with three-sectioned leading-edge flaps, improving takeoff and landing performance and allowing the ventral fin to be removed (although the taller fin was retained). The 707-320Bs built after 1963 used the same wing as the -320C and were known as 707-320B Advanced aircraft.

In total, 1,010 707s were built for civilian use between 1958 and 1978, though many of these found their way to military service. The 707 production line remained open for purpose-built military variants until 1991, with the last new-build 707 airframes built as E-3 and E-6 aircraft.

Traces of the 707 are still found in the 737, which uses a modified version of the 707&#x27;s fuselage, as well as the same external nose and cockpit configurations as those of the 707. These were also used on the previous 727, while the 757 also used the 707 fuselage cross-section.

==Design==
===Wings===
The 707&#x27;s wings are swept back at 35°, and like all swept-wing aircraft, display an undesirable &quot;Dutch roll&quot; flying characteristic that manifests itself as an alternating combined yawing and rolling motion. Boeing already had considerable experience with this on the B-47 and B-52, and had developed the yaw damper system on the B-47 that would be applied to later swept-wing configurations like the 707. However, many pilots new to the 707 had no experience with this instability as they were mostly accustomed to flying straight-wing propeller-driven aircraft such as the Douglas DC-7 and Lockheed Constellation.

On one customer-acceptance flight, where the yaw damper was turned off to familiarize the new pilots with flying techniques, a trainee pilot&#x27;s actions violently exacerbated the Dutch roll motion and caused three of the four engines to be torn from the wings. The plane, a brand new 707-227, &quot;N7071&quot;, destined for Braniff, crash-landed on a river bed north of Seattle at Arlington, Washington, killing four of the eight occupants.

In his autobiography, test pilot Tex Johnston describes a Dutch roll incident he experienced as a passenger on an early commercial 707 flight. As the aircraft&#x27;s movements did not cease and most of the passengers became ill, he suspected a misrigging of the directional autopilot (yaw damper). He went to the cockpit and found the crew unable to understand and resolve the situation. He introduced himself and relieved the ashen-faced captain who immediately left the cockpit feeling ill. Johnston disconnected the faulty autopilot and manually stabilized the plane &quot;with two slight control movements&quot;.

Johnston recommended Boeing increase the height of the tail fin, add a boosted rudder as well as add a ventral fin. These modifications were aimed at mitigating Dutch roll by providing more directional stability in yaw.

===Engines===
The initial was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojet engines.

The JT3D-3B engines are readily identifiable by the large gray secondary-air inlet doors in the nose cowl. These doors are fully open (sucked in at the rear) during takeoff to provide additional air. The doors automatically close with increasing airspeed.

The 707 was the first commercial jet aircraft to be fitted with clamshell-type thrust reversers.

====Turbocompressors====
The 707 uses engine-driven turbocompressors to supply compressed air for cabin pressurization. On many commercial 707s, the outer port (number 1) engine mount is distinctly different from the other three, as this engine is not fitted with a turbocompressor. Later-model 707s typically had this configuration, although American Airlines had turbocompressors on engines 2 and 3 only. Early 707 models often had turbocompressor fairings on all four engines, but with only two or three compressors installed.

====Upgraded engines====
Pratt &amp; Whitney, in a joint venture with Seven Q Seven (SQS) and Omega Air, selected the JT8D-219 low-bypass turbofan as a replacement powerplant for Boeing 707-based aircraft, calling their modified configuration a 707RE. Northrop Grumman selected the -219 to re-engine the US Air Force&#x27;s fleet of 19 E-8 Joint STARS aircraft, which would allow the J-STARS more time on station due to the engine&#x27;s greater fuel efficiency. NATO also planned to re-engine their fleet of E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft. The -219 is publicized as being half the cost of the competing powerplant, the CFM International CFM56, and is 40 dB quieter than the original JT3D engines.

==Operational history==
The first commercial orders for the 707 came on October 13, 1955, when leading global carrier Pan Am committed to 20 Boeing 707s, and 25 Douglas DC-8s, dramatically increasing their passenger capacity (in available revenue passenger seat-miles per hour/per day) over its existing fleet of propeller aircraft. The competition between the 707 and DC-8 was fierce. Pan Am ordered these planes when and as they did so that they would be the operators of the &quot;first-off&quot; production line for each aircraft type. Once the initial batch of the aircraft had been delivered to them and put into operation, Pan Am would have the distinction of being not only the &quot;Launch Customer&quot; for both transcontinental American jets, but the exclusive operator of American intercontinental jet transports for at least a year.

The only rival in intercontinental jet aircraft production at the time was the British de Havilland Comet. However, the Comet series had been the subject of fatal accidents (due to design flaws) early in its introduction and withdrawn from service; virtually redesigned from scratch, it was still smaller and slower than the 707 when reintroduced as version -4. In addition, airlines and their passengers at the time preferred the more established Douglas Aircraft as a maker of passenger aircraft, and several major carriers committed only to the Douglas DC-8, delayed by Douglas&#x27; decision to wait for the larger and more fuel efficient (Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A) turbojet to design a larger and longer range aircraft around. Anticipating this advantage, Boeing made a late and costly decision to redesign and enlarge the initial 707&#x27;s wing to help increase range and payload, giving birth to the 707-320.

Pan Am inaugurated 707 service with a christening at National Airport on October 17, 1958, attended by President Eisenhower, followed by a transatlantic flight for VIPs (personal guests of founder Juan Trippe) from Baltimore&#x27;s Friendship International Airport to Paris. The aircraft&#x27;s first commercial flight was from Idlewild Airport, New York, to Le Bourget, Paris, on October 26, 1958, with a fuel stop in Gander, Newfoundland. In December, National Airlines operated the first US domestic jet airline flights between New York/Idlewild and Miami, using 707s leased from Pan Am.
In February 1956, rival global giant Trans World Airlines&#x27; then-President Howard Hughes ordered eight new Boeing 707-120, dubbing the new jet service &quot;StarStream&quot;, launching its first jet service, between New York-Idlewild International Airport and San Francisco International Airport, on January 25, 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;northeastnews/twa-star-stream&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;airlineratings/twa-starstream-707&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

American Airlines was the first domestic airline to fly its own jets, on January 25, 1959. TWA started domestic 707-131 flights in March and Continental Airlines started 707-124 flights in June; airlines that had ordered only the DC-8, such as United, Delta, and Eastern, were left without jets until September and lost market share on transcontinental flights. Qantas was the first non-US airline to use the 707s, starting in 1959.

The 707 quickly became the most popular jetliner of its time. Its success led to rapid developments in airport terminals, runways, airline catering, baggage handling, reservations systems, and other air transport infrastructure. The advent of the 707 also led to the upgrading of air traffic control systems to prevent interference with military jet operations.

As the 1960s drew to a close, the exponential growth in air travel led to the 707 being a victim of its own success. The 707 had become too small to handle the increased numbers of passengers on the routes for which it had been designed. Stretching the fuselage again was not a viable option because the installation of larger, more powerful engines would need a larger undercarriage, which was not feasible given the design&#x27;s limited ground clearance at takeoff. Rather than stretch the fuselage, which would have also required pilot retraining, Boeing&#x27;s answer to the problem was the first wide-body airliner—the Boeing 747. The 707&#x27;s first-generation engine technology was also rapidly becoming obsolete in the areas of noise and fuel economy, especially after the 1973 oil crisis.
Operations of the 707 were threatened by the enactment of international noise regulations in 1985. Shannon Engineering of Seattle developed a hush kit with funding from Tracor, Inc, of Austin, Texas. By the late 1980s, 172 Boeing 707s had been equipped with the Quiet 707 package. Boeing acknowledged that more 707s were in service than before the hush kit was available.

Trans World Airlines flew the last scheduled 707 flight for passengers by a US carrier on October 30, 1983, although 707s remained in scheduled service by airlines from other nations for much longer. Middle East Airlines of Lebanon flew 707s and 720s in front-line passenger service until the end of the 1990s. Since LADE of Argentina removed its 707-320Bs from regular service in 2007, Saha Airlines of Iran was the last commercial operator of the Boeing 707. After suspending its scheduled passenger service in April 2013, Saha continued to operate a small fleet of 707s on behalf of the Iranian Air Force.

As of 2019, only a handful of 707s remain in operation, acting as military aircraft for aerial refueling, transport, and AWACS missions.

==Variants==

Although certified as Series 100s, 200s, 300s, etc., the different 707 variants are more commonly known as Series 120s, 220s, 320s, and so on, where the &quot;20&quot; part of the designation is Boeing&#x27;s &quot;customer number&quot; for its development aircraft.

===707-020===


Announced in July 1957 as a derivative for shorter flights from shorter runways, the 707-020 first flew on November 23, 1959. Its type certificate was issued on June 30, 1960, and it entered service with United Airlines on July 5, 1960. As a derivative, the 720 had low development costs, allowing profitability despite few sales.
Compared to the 707-120, it has a length reduced by 9 feet (2.7 m), a modified wing and a lightened airframe for a lower maximum takeoff weight. Powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojets, the initial 720 could cover a range with 131 passengers in two classes.

Powered by JT3D turbofans, the 720B first flew on October 6, 1960, and entered service in March 1961. It could seat 156 passengers in one class over a range. A total of 154 Boeing 720s and 720Bs were built until 1967. Some 720s were later converted to the 720B specification. The 720 was succeeded by the Boeing 727 trijet.

===707-120===
The 707-120 was the first production 707 variant, with a longer, wider fuselage, and greater wingspan than the Dash 80. The cabin had a full set of rectangular windows and could seat up to 189 passengers. It was designed for transcontinental routes, and often required a refueling stop when flying across the North Atlantic. It had four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C-6 turbojets, civilian versions of the military J57, initially producing with water injection. Maximum takeoff weight was and first flight was on December 20, 1957. Major orders were the launch order for 20 707-121 aircraft by Pan Am and an American Airlines order for 30 707-123 aircraft. The first revenue flight was on October 26, 1958; 56 were built, plus seven short-bodied -138s; the last -120 was delivered to Western in May 1960.

The 707-138 was a -120 with a fuselage shorter than the others, with (three frames) removed ahead and behind the wing, giving increased range. Maximum takeoff weight was the same as the standard version. It was a variant for Qantas, thus had its customer number 38. To allow for full-load takeoffs at the midflight refueling stop in Fiji, the wing&#x27;s leading-edge slats were modified for increased lift, and the allowable temperature range for use of full takeoff power was increased by 10°F (5.5°C). Seven -138s were delivered to Qantas between June and September 1959, and they first carried passengers in July of that year.

The 707-120B had Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D-1 turbofan engines, which were quieter, more powerful, and more fuel-efficient, rated at , with the later JT3D-3 version giving . (This thrust did not require water injection, eliminating both the system and 5000–6000 lb of water.) The -120B had the wing modifications introduced on the 720 and a longer tailplane; a total of 72 were built, 31 for American and 41 for TWA, plus six short-bodied -138Bs for Qantas. American had its 23 surviving -123s converted to -123Bs, but TWA did not convert its 15 -131s. The only other conversions were Pan Am&#x27;s five surviving -121s and one surviving -139, the three aircraft delivered to the USAF as -153s and the seven short-bodied Qantas -138s (making 13 total 707s delivered to Qantas between 1959 and 1964). The first flight of the -120B was on June 22, 1960, and American carried the first passengers in March 1961; the last delivery was to American in April 1969. Maximum weight was for both the long- and short-bodied versions.

===707-220===
The 707-220 was designed for hot and high operations with more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A-3 turbojets. Five of these were produced, but only four were ultimately delivered, with one being lost during a test flight. All were for Braniff International Airways and carried the model number 707-227; the first entered service in December 1959. This version was made obsolete by the arrival of the turbofan-powered 707-120B.

===707-320 Intercontinental===
The 707-320 Intercontinental is a stretched version of the turbojet-powered 707-120, initially powered by JT4A-3 or JT4A-5 turbojets producing each (most eventually got JT4A-11s). The interior allowed up to 189 passengers, the same as the -120 and -220 series, but improved two-class capacity due to an 80-in fuselage stretch ahead of the wing (from to ), with extensions to the fin and horizontal stabilizer extending the aircraft&#x27;s length further. The longer wing carried more fuel, increasing range by and allowing the aircraft to operate as true transoceanic aircraft. The wing modifications included outboard and inboard inserts, as well as a kink in the trailing edge to add area inboard. Takeoff weight was increased to initially and to with the higher-rated JT4As and center section tanks. Its first flight was on January 11, 1958; 69 turbojet 707-320s were delivered through January 1963, the first passengers being carried (by Pan Am) in August 1959.

===707-420===
The 707-420 was identical to the -320, but fitted with Rolls-Royce Conway 508 (RCo.12) turbofans (or by-pass turbojets as Rolls-Royce called them) of thrust each. The first announced customer was Lufthansa. BOAC&#x27;s controversial order was announced six months later, but the British carrier got the first service-ready aircraft off the production line. The British Air Registration Board refused to give the aircraft a certificate of airworthiness, citing insufficient yaw control, excessive rudder forces, and the ability to over-rotate on takeoff, stalling the wing on the ground (a fault of the de Havilland Comet 1). Boeing responded by adding to the vertical stabilizer, applying full instead of partial rudder boost, and fitting an underfin to prevent over-rotation. These modifications except to the fin under the tail became standard on all 707 variants and were retrofitted to all earlier 707s. The 37 -420s were delivered to BOAC, Lufthansa, Air-India, El Al, and Varig through November 1963; Lufthansa was the first to carry passengers, in March 1960.

===707-320B===
The 707-320B had the application of the JT3D turbofan to the Intercontinental, but with aerodynamic refinements. The wing was modified from the -320 by adding a second inboard kink, a dog-toothed leading edge, and curved low-drag wingtips instead of the earlier blunt ones. These wingtips increased overall wingspan by 3.0 ft (0.9 m). Takeoff gross weight was increased to . The 175 707-320B aircraft were all new-build; no original -320 models were converted to fan engines in civilian use. First service was June 1962, with Pan Am.

The 707-320B Advanced is an improved version of the -320B, adding the three-section leading-edge flaps already seen on the -320C. These reduced takeoff and landing speeds and altered the lift distribution of the wing, allowing the ventral fin found on earlier 707s to be removed. From 1965, -320Bs had the uprated -320C undercarriage allowing the same MTOW. These were often identified as 707-320BA-H.

===707-320C===
The 707-320C has a convertible passenger–freight configuration, which became the most widely produced variant of the 707. The 707-320C added a strengthened floor and a new cargo door to the -320B model. The wing was fitted with three-section leading-edge flaps which allowed the removal of the underfin. A total of 335 of this variant were built, including some with JT3D-7 engines ( takeoff thrust) and a takeoff weight of . Most -320Cs were delivered as passenger aircraft with airlines hoping the cargo door would increase second-hand values. The addition of two additional emergency exits, one on either side aft of the wing raised the maximum passenger limit to 219. Only a few aircraft were delivered as pure freighters. One of the final orders was by the Iranian Government for 14 707-3J9C aircraft capable of VIP transportation, communication, and in-flight refueling tasks.

===707-700===
The 707-700 was a test aircraft used to study the feasibility of using CFM International CFM56 engines on a 707 airframe and possibly retrofitting existing aircraft with the engine. After testing in 1979, &quot;N707QT&quot;, the last commercial 707 airframe, was restored to 707-320C configuration and delivered to the Moroccan Air Force as a tanker aircraft via a &quot;civilian&quot; order. Boeing abandoned the retrofit program, since they felt it would be a threat to the 757 and 767 programs. The information gathered from testing led to the eventual retrofitting of CFM56 engines to the USAF C-135/KC-135R models, and some military versions of the 707 also used the CFM56. The Douglas DC-8 &quot;Super 70&quot; series with CFM56 engines was developed and extended the DC-8&#x27;s life in a stricter noise regulatory environment. As a result, significantly more DC-8s remained in service into the 21st century than 707s.

===Undeveloped variants===
The 707-620 was a proposed domestic range-stretched variant of the 707-320B. The 707-620 was to carry around 200 passengers while retaining several aspects of the 707-320B. It would have been delivered around 1968 and would have also been Boeing&#x27;s answer to the stretched Douglas DC-8 Series 60. Had the 707-620 been built, it would have cost around US$8,000,000. However, engineers discovered that a longer fuselage and wing meant a painstaking redesign of the wing and landing-gear structures. Rather than spend money on upgrading the 707, engineer Joe Sutter stated the company &quot;decided spending money on the 707 wasn&#x27;t worth it&quot;. The project was cancelled in 1966 in favor of the newer Boeing 747.

The 707-820 was a proposed intercontinental stretched variant of the 707-320B. This variant was to be powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D-15 turbofan engines, and it would have had a nearly extension in wingspan, to . Two variations were proposed, the 707-820(505) model and the 707-820(506) model. The 505 model would have had a fuselage longer than the 707-320B, for a total length of . This model would have carried 209 passengers in mixed-class configuration and 260 passengers in all-economy configuration. The 506 model would have had a fuselage longer than the 707-320B, to in length. This second model would have carried 225 passengers in mixed-class configuration and 279 passengers in all-economy configuration. Like the 707-620, the 707-820 was also set to compete with the stretched DC-8-60 Super Series models. The design was being pitched to American, TWA, BOAC, and Pan Am at the time of its proposal in early 1965. The 707-820 would have cost US$10,000,000. Like the 707-620, the 707-820 would have required a massive structural redesign to the wing and gear structures. The 707-820 was also cancelled in 1966 in favor of the 747.

===Military versions===

The militaries of the US and other countries have used the civilian 707 aircraft in a variety of roles, and under different designations. (The 707 and US Air Force&#x27;s KC-135 were developed in parallel from the Boeing 367–80 prototype.)

The Boeing E-3 Sentry is a US military airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft based on the Boeing 707 that provides all-weather surveillance, command, control, and communications.

The Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS is an aircraft modified from the Boeing 707-300 series commercial airliner. The E-8 carries specialized radar, communications, operations and control subsystems. The most prominent external feature is the 40 ft (12 m) canoe-shaped radome under the forward fuselage that houses the 24 ft (7.3 m) APY-7 active electronically scanned array side looking airborne radar antenna.

The VC-137 variant of the Stratoliner was a special-purpose design meant to serve as Air Force One, the secure transport for the President of the United States. These models were in operational use from 1962 to 1990. The first presidential jet aircraft, a VC-137B designated SAM 970, is on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle. Two VC-137C aircraft are on display with SAM 26000 at the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio and SAM 27000 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.

The Canadian Forces also operated the Boeing 707 with the designation CC-137 Husky (707-347C) from 1971 to 1997.

Boeing 717 was the company designation for the C-135 Stratolifter and KC-135 Stratotanker derivatives of the 367-80. (The 717 designation was later reused in renaming the McDonnell Douglas MD-95 to Boeing 717 after the company merged with Boeing.)

==Operators==

Boeing&#x27;s customer codes used to identify specific options and livery specified by customers was started with the 707, and has been maintained through all Boeing&#x27;s models. In essence the same system as used on the earlier Boeing 377, the code consisted of two digits affixed to the model number to identify the specific aircraft version. For example, Pan Am was assigned code &quot;21&quot;. Thus, a 707-320B sold to Pan Am had the model number 707-321B. The number remained constant as further aircraft were purchased; thus, when Pan Am purchased the 747-100, it had the model number 747-121.

In the 1980s, the USAF acquired around 250 used 707s to provide replacement turbofan engines for the KC-135E Stratotanker program.

The 707 is no longer operated by commercial airlines. American actor John Travolta owned an ex-Qantas 707-138B, with the registration &quot;N707JT.&quot; In May 2017, he donated the plane to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society near Wollongong, Australia. The plane is planned to be flown to Shellharbour Airport, where HARS is based, once repairs to ensure safe flying condition have been completed. The repairs were delayed several times since the 2017 announcement.

<text>Above the Law, also known as Nico: Above the Law, or simply Nico, is a 1988 American crime action thriller film co-written, co-produced and directed by Andrew Davis. It marked the film debut of Steven Seagal, who also produced the film alongside Davis, and stars Seagal alongside Pam Grier, Sharon Stone, Ron Dean and Henry Silva. Seagal plays Nico Toscani, an ex-CIA agent, an Aikido specialist and a Chicago policeman who discovers a conspiracy upon investigating the mysterious shipment of military explosives seized from a narcotics dealer.

The film originated after a successful screen test financed by Michael Ovitz, leading to Seagal being offered a contract by Warner Bros. It was set and filmed on location in Chicago. The film premiered in the United States on April 8, 1988. &quot;Above the Law&quot; is regarded as the first American film to feature Aikido in fight sequences. Seagal tweeted plans for &quot;Above the Law 2&quot; on August 1, 2016, but the project remains in pre-production.

==Plot==
Sergeant Nico Toscani, who traces his roots to Palermo, Sicily, is a detective in the Chicago Police Department&#x27;s vice squad. At an early age he had become interested in martial arts, and moved to Japan to study them. In 1969, Toscani was recruited to join the CIA by Nelson Fox and was involved in covert operations on the Vietnamese-Cambodian border during the Vietnam War. There, he became disgusted with DCI Kurt Zagon, who tortured prisoners. A stand-off occurred when Toscani tried to stop a torture session, and he left the CIA. Toscani returned to Chicago, joined the police department, and got married.

Toscani and his new partner Detective Delores &quot;Jacks&quot; Jackson are investigating a drug ring, and after busting two of the dealers, including Salvadorian drug lord Tony Salvano, Toscani finds C-4 explosive. Shortly afterward, the men that Toscani and Jackson arrested are released at the request of federal officials, and Toscani is ordered to stand down. Later, the priest of Toscani&#x27;s parish is killed in an explosion during Mass. Fox calls Toscani and tells him to move his family to a safer location, saying that he is in danger. Under pressure from the feds, Toscani is asked to turn in his badge. He eventually discovers that the dealers he busted are linked to Zagon, who is still with the CIA, and who is being accused of human rights violations by a Central American priest who was being sheltered by Toscani&#x27;s priest. While Zagon is torturing the priest, Toscani bursts in and a gun battle ensues. Detectives Lukich and Jackson are wounded during the shootout, and Toscani has to flee.

Senator Ernest Harrison is investigating Zagon&#x27;s group to reveal their covert operations and drug dealing. When Toscani finds out that Zagon killed the priest and is planning to kill Harrison, he goes after Zagon. Fox confronts Toscani while the latter is doing surveillance on a rooftop, but they are later interrupted by Zagon&#x27;s men. Fox is killed and Toscani is captured. He is held in the kitchen of a hotel during a Harrison campaign rally. Before Zagon can kill Harrison, Toscani breaks free and kills Zagon and all of his remaining men. Afterwards, Toscani meets Harrison, who has been informed of everything. Harrison promises justice and Toscani says he is now willing to testify about his experiences with Zagon and covert operations in the CIA.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; stated &quot;It contains 50 percent more plot than it needs, but that allows it room to grow in areas not ordinarily covered in action thrillers.&quot; In a negative review, Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticized it as &quot;woefully short on originality.&quot; In another negative review, film historian Leonard Maltin described the picture as a &quot;...slick but stupid action-fest; Seagal&#x27;s thesping makes Chuck Norris seem like Laurence Olivier.&quot;

<text>Jonathan Coe (; born 19 August 1961) is an English novelist and writer. His work has an underlying preoccupation with political issues, although this serious engagement is often expressed comically in the form of satire. For example, &quot;What a Carve Up!&quot; (1994) reworks the plot of an old 1960s spoof horror film of the same name. It is set within the &quot;carve up&quot; of the UK&#x27;s resources that was carried out by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative governments of the 1980s.

==Early life and education==
Coe was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, on 19 August 1961 to Roger and Janet (née Kay) Coe. He studied at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, and Trinity College, Cambridge. He taught at the University of Warwick, where he completed an MA and PhD in English Literature.

==Career==
Coe has long been interested in both music and literature. In the mid-1980s he played with a band (The Peer Group) and tried to get a recording of his music. He also wrote songs and played keyboards for a short-lived feminist cabaret group, Wanda and the Willy Warmers.

He published his first novel, &quot;The Accidental Woman&quot;, in 1987. In 1994 his fourth novel &quot;What a Carve Up!&quot; won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, and the Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger in France. It was followed by &quot;The House of Sleep&quot;, which won the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain Best Novel award and, in France, the Prix Médicis. As of 2022, Coe has published fourteen novels.

Besides novels, Coe has written a biography of the experimental British novelist B. S. Johnson, &quot;Like a Fiery Elephant&quot;, which D. J. Taylor described in &quot;Literary Review&quot; as &quot;a deeply unconventional biography,&quot; won the Samuel Johnson Prize in 2005. Also in 2005 Penguin published his &quot;collected shorter prose&quot;, a volume consisting of only 55 pages, under the title &quot;9th &amp; 13th&quot;. The same collection was published in France in 2012 under the title &quot;Désaccords imparfaits&quot;.

He has written a short children&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift, and a children&#x27;s story called &quot;The Broken Mirror&quot;. Both titles are published in Italy only, as &quot;La storia di Gulliver&quot; (2011) and &quot;Lo specchio dei desideri&quot; (2012).

A handwritten manuscript page from &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot; was displayed as part of the &quot;Writing Britain: Wastelands to Wonderlands&quot; exhibition that ran at the British Library during 2012.

Coe was a judge for the Booker Prize in 1996 and has been a jury member at the Venice Film Festival (in 1999, under the chairmanship of Emir Kusturica) and the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2007.

In 2012 Coe was invited by Javier Marías to become a duke of the kingdom of Redonda. He chose as his title &quot;Duke of Prunes&quot;, after a favourite piece of music by Frank Zappa.

Coe read an excerpt of &quot;The Terrible Privacy of Maxwell Sim&quot; to crowds at the Latitude Festival in July 2009. The central character was to be &quot;a product of the social media boom&quot;, and &quot;the sort of person with hundreds of Facebook friends but no one to talk to when his marriage breaks up.&quot;

Coe&#x27;s 2019 book &quot;Middle England&quot; won the European Book Prize and also won the Costa Book Award in the Novel category.

==Film and TV adaptations==
Both &quot;What a Carve Up!&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot; (2001) have been adapted as drama serials for BBC Radio 4. &quot;What a Carve Up!&quot; was adapted by David Nobbs. &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot; was adapted for television by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and broadcast on BBC Two in January–February 2005. &quot;The Dwarves of Death&quot; (1990) was filmed as &quot;Five Seconds to Spare&quot; in 1999, for which Coe himself co-wrote the screenplay.

&quot;The Very Private Life of Mister Sim&quot;, a French film based on &quot;The Terrible Privacy of Maxwell Sim&quot;, directed by Michel Leclerc and produced by Delante Cinema and Kare Productions, was released on 16 December 2015.

==Musical collaborations==

Music is a constant thread in Coe&#x27;s work. He played music for years and tried to find a record label as a performer before becoming a published novelist. He had to wait until 2001 to make his first appearance on a record with &quot;9th &amp; 13th&quot; (Tricatel, 2001), a collection of readings of his work, set to music by jazz pianist/double bass player Danny Manners and indiepop artist Louis Philippe.

Coe is a lifelong fan of Canterbury progressive rock. His novel &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot; is named after an album by Hatfield and the North. He has contributed to the liner notes for that band&#x27;s archival release &quot;Hatwise Choice&quot;. He once said: &quot;I&#x27;d love to find a pianist to collaborate with – maybe Alex Maguire, who is now playing with the reformed line-up of Hatfield and the North&quot;. In fact, this collaboration did come to fruition, at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in 2009, where Maguire performed a suite of piano pieces to accompany readings from the novel &quot;The Rain Before It Falls&quot;. Coe has also performed live with flautist Theo Travis.

Coe wrote the sleevenotes &quot;Reflections on The High Llamas&quot; for the 2003 compilation of The High Llamas &quot;Retrospective, Rarities and Instrumentals&quot;. He has also written lyrics for songs on the albums &quot;My Favourite Part of You&quot; and &quot;The Wonder of It All&quot; by Louis Philippe, and &quot;Earth to Ether&quot; by Theo Travis, for which the vocalist was Richard Sinclair.

In 2008 Coe wrote &quot;Say Hi to the Rivers and the Mountains&quot;, a 60-minute piece of what he calls &quot;spoken musical theatre&quot;, with dialogue to be delivered continuously by three actors over a sequence of songs and instrumentals by The High Llamas. The work was premiered at the Analog Festival in Dublin that summer, and subsequently performed at various venues in the UK and Spain. The most recent performance was as part of the &quot;Notes and Letters&quot; Festival at Kings Place in London in September 2011, with Henry Goodman in the leading role of Bobby. The piece is inspired by the proposed demolition of Robin Hood Gardens, an East London council estate designed by Alison and Peter Smithson.

In March 2011, at the City Winery in New York, Coe took the keyboard solos on a live version of &quot;Nigel Blows A Tune&quot; from the Caravan album &quot;In the Land of Grey and Pink&quot;, along with the musician/novelist Wesley Stace and his band The English UK.

==Personal life==
Coe married Janine McKeown in 1989, and they have two daughters born in 1997 and 2000.

In 2009, Coe took part in Oxfam&#x27;s first annual book festival, &quot;Bookfest&quot;. Along with William Sutcliffe, Coe volunteered for the Oxfam Bloomsbury Bookshop in London on Thursday 9 July. Coe and Sutcliffe were each asked to choose a theme, and to find books from the stockroom to set up in the shop&#x27;s window. Coe chose satire as the theme for his display. He chose books by or about Michael Moore, Bill Hicks, Peter Cook and Steve Bell. He also unearthed a script of Terry Gilliam’s film &quot;Brazil&quot;.

Coe donated a story to Oxfam&#x27;s &quot;Ox-Tales&quot; project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Coe&#x27;s story was published in the &quot;Earth&quot; collection.

He is a trustee of the charity Cleared Ground Demining, and in spring 2007 visited Guinea-Bissau to write an article about their operations there.

In a 2001 newspaper interview, Coe described himself as an atheist.

<text>Marked for Death is a 1990 American action film directed by Dwight H. Little. The film stars Steven Seagal as John Hatcher, a former DEA troubleshooter who returns to his Illinois hometown to find it taken over by a posse of vicious Jamaican drug dealers led by Screwface. Using a combination of fear and Obeah, a Jamaican syncretic religion of West African and Caribbean origin similar to Haitian vodou and Santería, Screwface attempts to control the drug trade in Lincoln Heights.

==Plot==

DEA Agents John Hatcher and his partner Chico pursue drug dealer Hector on foot. Later, at a drug deal, Hector is revealed to have blown John&#x27;s cover. John and Chico manage to fight their way out of the ambush caused by Hector. During their escape, Chico is shot and mortally wounded by a woman pretending to be unarmed. In response, Hatcher immediately shoots several rounds through the wall, hitting and killing the woman. Hatched kicks in the door to her room and then realizes Chico&#x27;s assailant was a woman and he has killed her. Hatcher gets Chico back to the car, but Chico dies as they leave the meeting spot. He returns home and he retires from working from the DEA. He visits his friend Max Keller, who is disturbed to see Jamaican drug dealers, known as Posse, hanging around the school where Max works. Later at a bar, they see the dealers again, and a gunfight breaks out. John manages to assist in arresting one of the Jamaicans and a responding FBI agent asks him to join the case; he refuses. At the scene, a detective finds a symbol which an expert named Leslie Davalos reveals to be a religious icon to mark the crimes of a man called Screwface.

Screwface sends some men to do a drive-by at John&#x27;s sister&#x27;s house (where he is staying); they wound his niece Tracey. John interrogates a gangster he saw in the club shootout called Jimmy Fingers, but he refuses to help and John is forced to kill him. One of Screwface&#x27;s men, who is Jimmy&#x27;s accomplice, arrives and only gives a small clue on Screwface before defenestrating. Upon returning to his sister&#x27;s house, John finds the same symbol on a rug along with a cow tongue and black cross nailed to the door. Leslie informs him that such symbols mark the person for death. John demands that the FBI provide protection for his family.

During a call with his sister, she is attacked again by Screwface&#x27;s men in an attempt to ritually sacrifice her. John rushes and arrives in time as Screwface flees. John enlists Max&#x27;s help to go after the gang and try to find Screwface, trailing some of his gang in a park and engage in a chase ending in a high-end store. John and Max kill several of them but do not learn anything about Screwface. However, Screwface manages to ambush John that night, trapping his car between two construction vehicles and burning it with a molotov cocktail, but John escapes.

Charles Marks, a Jamaican detective working with the FBI on Screwface&#x27;s crimes, reaches out to John and Max and offers his help. Together they acquire new weapons and go to Jamaica, where Screwface is thought to have fled. With the help of a former girlfriend of his, they presumably get an address and a clue: she says that Screwface has two heads and four eyes. The three descend on Screwface&#x27;s complex during a party one evening. John uses an explosive device to distract the guards and cut the power; Max and Charles open fire on the ambushing Posse gang while John infiltrates the house. He is captured and prepared for a ritual sacrifice by Screwface but escapes his bonds and manages to behead Screwface in a swordfight.

They return to Chicago and present Screwface&#x27;s head and sword to the remaining loyal gang members in order to intimate them into leaving. John tells them to get out of town within 24 hours or he will come for all of them. As they are leaving, Screwface surprisingly appears behind Charles and stabs him with a sword. Mortally wounding him. The posse, surprised by Screwface&#x27;s appearance, start shooting at the trio, with Max getting shot in the lag as they escape Charles passes away during the escape, as Max says he will cover John&#x27;s pursuit of Screwface, who turns out to be a twin brother of the Screwface Charles said had fled to Jamaica and was responsible for all the Posse crimes in the United States. After a lengthy fight, John manages to blind Screwface before breaking his back and throwing him down an elevator shaft, where his gang sees his body impaled on a spike, with John remarking they he hoped that they weren&#x27;t triplets. John and Max leave the crime scene with Charles&#x27; body in tow.

== Production ==
Steven Seagal had wanted to hire director Dwight Little for his second feature, &quot;Hard to Kill&quot;, but studio Warner Bros. vetoed his choice, and went with Bruce Malmuth instead. According to Little, Seagal had the option in his contract with Warner to do one film with another studio. Seagal chose to exercise that option and make his third film at 20th Century Fox, where he demanded that they hire Little for &quot;Marked for Death&quot;. &quot;I got that job only because Steven insisted,&quot; said Little. During production, the studio was pushing for more humor in the film, but Little and Seagal had made a pact to resist these attempts. Their template for the film was &quot;The French Connection&quot;.

On the third day of shooting &quot;Marked for Death&quot;, &quot;Hard to Kill&quot; came out in theaters. Dwight Little: &quot;It opened huge, and it stayed on top for a while. No one, including Steven, thought that was going to be success. But it was. Frankly, just based on his charisma and a couple of good action scenes. I was downtown shooting a scene for &quot;Marked for Death&quot; when suddenly I see all these limos and towncars coming to the set. They were all CAA-agents and producers, coming out of the woodwork to see the next big action guy. They all wanted to talk to him.&quot;

Of Seagal&#x27;s martial arts, Little said: &quot;Steven is the only guy who does what he does in the movies, where you let your opponent&#x27;s energy go past you. In that respect, he&#x27;s totally unique. But it&#x27;s not a forward, high kicking, punching thing. That&#x27;s why I felt I needed action movie stuff, like car chases, gun fights, explosions and some old fashioned cop stuff. Because if we tried to string together a bunch of Steven&#x27;s fights, they will quickly start to feel the same.&quot;

==Music==

A soundtrack containing hip hop, reggae, and R&amp;B music was released on September 27, 1990 by Delicious Vinyl.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Marked for Death&quot; opened at number one at the U.S. box office with an opening weekend gross of $11,790,047, making it Seagal&#x27;s second straight film to open #1. It remained at #1 for 3 weekends. It earned a little more than $46 million domestically and $58 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 27% of 11 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4/10. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale. Both &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave it a thumbs up, writing that it was another solid Seagal action film. In a less than favorable response from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, they wrote that the film is partially &quot;undone by murky cinematography&quot;. The Chicago Tribune was very critical of the film.

<text>Hard to Kill is a 1990 American vigilante action-thriller film directed by Bruce Malmuth, starring Steven Seagal, Kelly LeBrock, William Sadler and Frederick Coffin. Seagal&#x27;s second film after &quot;Above the Law&quot;, he portrays Mason Storm, a detective who falls into a coma after being shot during a home invasion that killed his wife. Reawakening seven years later, Storm embarks on a journey to avenge the death of his wife, and expose the corruption of Senator Vernon Trent, the man who ordered the murder of his family. The film was released on February 9, 1990, and grossed $75 million worldwide.

==Plot==
In 1983, Mason Storm (Steven Seagal), a Los Angeles police internal affairs detective investigates a mob meeting that takes place by a pier. He records a shadowy figure who assures the mob they can rely on his political support. Mason is spotted, but escapes. Unaware that he is monitored by corrupt cops, Mason informs his partner, Becker, and his friend Lt. O’Malley that he has evidence of corruption.

Mason hides the videotape in his house. When he goes upstairs, a hit squad composed of corrupt policemen, including Jack Axel and Max Quentero, break in and proceed to murder Mason&#x27;s wife and shoot him. Mason&#x27;s young son, Sonny, escapes out of a window. The corrupt policemen frame Mason, making it look like a murder-suicide. At the same time, assassins kill Mason&#x27;s partner. Later at the hospital, Mason is first pronounced dead, but is then discovered to be alive, although in a coma. To prevent the assassins from finishing the job, Lieutenant O&#x27;Malley tells the medics to keep Mason&#x27;s status a secret.

Seven years later, Mason wakes from his coma. Andy Stewart (Kelly LeBrock), one of his nurses, makes a phone call, which is intercepted by corrupt police officers. They send Axel to finish the job and kill the nurses to whom Mason might have talked. Mason realizes that he is still in danger, but his muscles have atrophied to where he can barely move. He manages to get to an elevator, and when Andy sees her co-workers killed, she helps Mason escape.

Needing time to recuperate, Andy takes Mason to a friend&#x27;s house, where Mason uses his knowledge of acupuncture, moxibustion and other meditation techniques to recover his strength. While training, Mason hears a commercial for Senator Vernon Trent and recognizes the voice from the pier. Mason contacts O&#x27;Malley, who supplies him with weapons and tells him that his son is still alive. O&#x27;Malley adopted Sonny and sent him to a private school so that he would be out of danger. He arranges to meet O&#x27;Malley and his now-teenage son at a train station later. After O&#x27;Malley leaves, Senator Trent&#x27;s men find the house and attempt to kill Andy and Mason, but they both manage to escape.

Posing as a real estate agent, Mason recovers the hidden videotape from his old house. O&#x27;Malley and Sonny arrive at the train station, but are confronted by some of the Senator&#x27;s men. Sonny flees with the tape, but O&#x27;Malley is killed. When Mason arrives, he sees Sonny running away from Quentero and Nolan. Mason catches up with the men and subdues Nolan by breaking his leg and throwing him in a trash bin. He then beats up Quentero and recognizes him as one of the men who took part in the assault on Mason&#x27;s home. Mason proceeds to snap Quentero&#x27;s neck, killing him. After a brief reunion with his son, Mason goes after Senator Trent.

Mason sneaks into the Senator&#x27;s mansion and manages to eliminate his men one by one. Mason fights with Axel in the billiard room and avenges his wife by jamming a broken pool cue into Axel&#x27;s neck, killing him. Next, Mason leaves a death taunt to Capt. Hulland, another corrupt cop who betrayed Mason to Trent, and stalks Hulland through the house before cornering the corrupt captain near the fireplace. Mason then strangles Hulland with his necktie and breaks his neck, killing him as well. Mason finally confronts Senator Trent and holds him at gunpoint when the police storm the mansion. However, they reveal that they had already seen the film and knew that Mason was set up. Trent is arrested, and Mason is reunited with Andy and his son as the footage from the videotape is played on the news, showing that Trent making a deal with the underworld mob and coming out of the shadows.

<text>The Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) is a Conservative Jewish education organization in New York City, New York. It is one of the academic and spiritual centers of Conservative Judaism and a center for academic scholarship in Jewish studies. The Jewish Theological Seminary Library is one of the most significant collections of Judaica in the world.

==History==
===Possible antecedents: Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau===

Rabbi Zecharias Frankel (1801–1875) was a leading figure in mid-19th-century German Jewry. Known for both his traditionalist views and the esteem he held for scientific study of Judaism, Frankel was at first considered a moderate figure within the nascent Reform movement. He severely criticized the 1844 first Reform rabbinic conference of Braunschweig, yet eventually agreed to participate in the next, in spite of warnings from conservative friends such as Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport. He withdrew from the assembly, held in Frankfurt am Main in 1845, making a final break with the Reform camp after coming to regard their positions as excessively radical. In 1854 he became the director of a new rabbinical school, the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau. 

Rabbi Bernard Drachman, a key Frankel student and one of the founders of the American JTS, was himself Orthodox, and claimed that the Breslau seminary was completely Orthodox. Others disagree, citing the published viewpoint of Frankel. In his magnum opus &quot;Darkhei HaMishnah&quot; (&quot;Ways of the Mishnah&quot;), Frankel amassed scholarly support which showed that Jewish law was not static, but rather had always developed in response to changing conditions. He called his approach towards Judaism &quot;Positive-Historical&quot;, which meant that one should accept Jewish law and tradition as normative, yet one must be open to changing and developing the law in the same historical fashion in which Judaism has always historically developed.

===Seminary&#x27;s founding: Morais era (1886–1897)===
The Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) was founded in 1886 through the efforts of two distinguished rabbis, Sabato Morais and Henry Pereira Mendes, along with a group of prominent lay leaders from Sephardic congregations in Philadelphia and New York. Its mission was to preserve the knowledge and practice of historical Judaism. In 1887, JTS held its first class of ten students in the vestry of the Spanish-Portuguese Synagogue, New York City&#x27;s oldest congregation. 

About this time in North America, the Reform movement was growing at a rapid pace, alarming more traditional (halakhic) Jews. Sabato Morais, rabbi of Philadelphia&#x27;s Congregation Mikveh Israel championed the reaction to American Reform. At one time, Morais had been a voice for moderation and bridge-building among the Reformers. He opposed the more radical changes but was open to moderate changes that would not break with significant traditional changes. After the Reform movement published the Pittsburgh Platform in late 1885, Morais recognized the futility of his efforts and began to work with like-minded rabbis to strengthen the Orthodox institutions.

One of the tools his group used was creating a new rabbinical school in New York City. The &quot;Jewish Theological Seminary Association&quot; was founded with Morais as its President in 1886 as an Orthodox institution to combat the hegemony of the Reform movement. The school was hosted by Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes&#x27; Congregation Shearith Israel, a sister synagogue to Mikveh Israel.

Morais and Mendes were soon joined by Alexander Kohut and Bernard Drachman, both of whom had received &quot;semicha&quot; (rabbinic ordination) at Rabbi Frankel&#x27;s Breslau seminary. They shaped the curriculum and philosophy of the new school after Rabbi Frankel&#x27;s seminary. The first graduate to be ordained, in 1894, was Joseph Hertz, who would go on to become the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth.

Morais was president of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America until he died in 1897.

===Schechter era (1902–1915)===
After Morais&#x27;s death, Mendes led the school, but the financial position of the association became precarious, and Mendes did not have the resources to turn it around. In October 1901, a new organization was projected entitled the &quot;Jewish Theological Seminary of America&quot;, with which the association was invited to incorporate. This arrangement was carried into effect April 14, 1902. The new organization was endowed with a fund of over $500,000, and was presented with a suitable building on University Heights by Jacob H. Schiff. It obtained a charter from the state of New York (approved Feb. 20, 1902), &quot;for the perpetuation of the tenets of the Jewish religion, the cultivation of Hebrew literature, the pursuit of Biblical and archeological research, the advancement of Jewish scholarship, the establishment of a library, and the education and training of Jewish rabbis and teachers. It is empowered to grant and confer the degrees of Rabbi, Ḥazan, Master and Doctor of Hebrew Literature, and Doctor of Divinity, and also to award certificates of proficiency to persons qualified to teach in Hebrew schools.&quot; The reorganized seminary was opened on Sept. 15, 1902, in the old building of the Theological Seminary Association at 736 Lexington Avenue. A search was executed for a new president.

Solomon Schechter was recruited from Great Britain. His religious approach seemed compatible with JTS&#x27;s, and he assumed the presidency, as well as serving as Professor of Jewish theology. In a series of papers he articulated an ideology for the nascent movement of Conservative Judaism. Many of the Orthodox rabbis associated with JTS vehemently disagreed with him, and left the institution. About 100 days after Schechter&#x27;s appointment, the Agudath Harabbonim formed, principally in protest, and declared that they would not accept any new ordinations from JTS, though previous recipients were still welcome. The more moderate Orthodox Union (OU), however, maintained some ties to JTS, and some of its rabbis, including Drachman, continued to teach there.

In 1913, Schechter directed the creation of the United Synagogue of America, as a formal group for member synagogues who subscribed to his philosophy. The group was strongly aligned with JTS from its creation to the present day.

Along with Schechter and Bernard Drachman, professors at the seminary at the time included: Louis Ginzberg, professor of Talmud; Alexander Marx, professor of history and rabbinical literature and librarian; Israel Friedländer, professor of Bible; Joseph Mayor Asher, professor of homiletics; and Joshua A. Joffe, instructor in Talmud. In 1905, Israel Davidson joined the faculty, teaching Hebrew and Rabbinics. According to David Ellenson and Lee Bycel, &quot;each of these men was a distinguished scholar, and the academic reputation of the Seminary soared with the addition of these men to the faculty. ... Schechter was determined to carve out the highest academic reputation for the Seminary.&quot;

The rabbinical school had very high academic standards. The curriculum focused especially on Talmud, legal codes, and classical rabbinic literature, but aside from a little time for a Homiletics class, very little time was spent on practical training for serving in a rabbinical position.

As of 1904 there were 37 students in the theological department, and 120 students took a set of courses designed for teachers. This set of course later evolved into the Teachers Institute.

Mordechai Kaplan joined the faculty during this period, becoming professor of homiletics following Joseph Mayor Asher&#x27;s death. Kaplan became the first principal of the Teachers Institute (TI), which opened in 1909. A majority of TI students were women, both because teaching was seen as a women&#x27;s profession and because the Teachers Institute was one of the only institutions where women could obtain an advanced education in Jewish studies. The Teachers Institute offered both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The undergraduate division is now the Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies, and the graduate division is the William Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education.

===Adler era (1915–1940)===
In 1915, Schechter was succeeded by Cyrus Adler, the President of Dropsie College. A member of the board with impressive academic qualifications, he was initially seen as an interim replacement for Schechter. Adler went on to serve as President until 1940.

During the 1920s, Adler explored the possibility of a merger with Yeshiva University, but the Orthodox leaders of Yeshiva University viewed JTS as insufficiently Orthodox.

New faculty appointed during the early part of Adler&#x27;s tenure included the Biblical scholar Jacob Hoschander. In the 1920s, Boaz Cohen and Louis Finkelstein, both of whom were ordained at JTS and completed their doctoral degrees at Columbia University, joined the Talmud faculty. In the 1930s, Adler appointed H.L. Ginsberg, Robert Gordis, and Alexander Sperber as professors of Bible. He also gave appointments to Israel Efros, Simon Greenberg, Milton Steinberg, and Ismar Elbogen.

During his tenure, Adler groomed Louis Finkelstein as his chosen successor. In 1931, he appointed Finkelstein to a full professorship. Finkelstein became the Solomon Schechter Professor of Theology. In 1937 Adler appointed Finkelstein as Provost.

In 1930 the organization commissioned a new headquarters for 122nd Street and Broadway in a neo-colonial style, with a tower at the corner. The architects were Gehron, Ross and Alley.

In 1931, the Seminary College of Jewish Studies was established for students who wanted college-level courses in Jewish studies but who were not preparing for teaching careers. This branch is now part of the Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies.

===Finkelstein era (1940–72)===
Louis Finkelstein became chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1940. During his chancellorship, JTS made significant efforts to engage the American public. One of its signature programs was a radio and television show called &quot;The Eternal Light&quot;. The show aired on Sunday afternoons, featuring well-known Jewish personalities like Chaim Potok and Elie Wiesel. Broadcasts did not involve preaching or prayer, but drew on history, literature and social issues to explore Judaism and Jewish holidays in a manner that was accessible to persons of any faith. The show continued to run until 1985.

During the 1940s, the Jewish Theological Seminary established Camp Ramah as a tool for furthering Jewish education. The founders envisioned an informal camp setting where Jewish youth would reconnect with the synagogue and Jewish tradition, and a new cadre of American-born Jewish leadership could be cultivated. The first camp opened in Conover, Wisconsin in 1947. The program was drawn up by Moshe Davis and Sylvia Ettenberg of the JTS Teachers&#x27; Institute.

In 1945, JTS established a new institution, the Leadership Training Fellowship, designed to educate young people within Conservative synagogues and guide them into Jewish public service.

In 1952, the Jewish Theological Seminary opened a new school known as the Cantors Institute. (The school was later renamed the H. L. Miller Cantorial School and College of Jewish Music.) This was at roughly the same time that the other established American Jewish seminaries, Hebrew Union College and Yeshiva University, opened cantorial schools. Prior to this time, American cantors were often trained in Europe.

In 1950, Finkelstein created the Universal Brotherhood program, which &quot;brought together laymen interested in interpreting the ethical dimensions of Judaism to the wider society.&quot; JTS expanded its public outreach in the 1950s with Finkelstein&#x27;s development of JTS&#x27;s Institute for Religious Studies and the establishment of its Herbert H. Lehman Institute of Ethics.

During the Finkelstein era, the Institute for Religious and Social Studies brought together Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish scholars for theological discussions. (In 1986, the name of the institute was changed to the Finkelstein Institute for Religious and Social Studies in Finkelstein&#x27;s honor.)

In 1957, JTS announced plans to build a satellite campus in Jerusalem for JTS rabbinical students studying in Israel. A building was completed in 1962. (The campus eventually evolved into the home of the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies.) In 1962, the seminary also acquired the Schocken Institute for Jewish Research and its library in Jerusalem.

In 1968, JTS received a charter from the State of New York to create an Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities, which conferred bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees. The Institute was designed as a non-sectarian academic institute which would train future college and university professors. Its first students enrolled in 1970. The Institute later evolved into the Graduate School of the Jewish Theological Seminary.

====Faculty during the Finkelstein era====
When Finkelstein took office, prominent faculty members included Louis Ginzberg, Alexander Marx, Mordecai Kaplan, H.L. Ginsberg, Robert Gordis, and Boaz Cohen.

In 1940, Finkelstein made his most significant academic appointment, hiring the prominent Talmud scholar Saul Lieberman as Professor of Palestinian Literature and Institutions. In 1948, Lieberman became dean of the Rabbinical School. In 1958, he was named rector of the Seminary.

In 1945, Finkelstein hired the theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel, who had been teaching for a brief period at Hebrew Union College. During the course of his chancellorship, Finkelstein also gave academic appointments to other prominent scholars including Moshe Davis (1942), Shalom Spiegel (1943), Yochanan Muffs (1954), Max Kadushin (1960), Gerson Cohen, David Weiss Halivni, Judah Goldin, Chaim Dimitrovsky, and Seymour Siegel.

Finkelstein appointed Max Arzt to serve as Vice-Chancellor of JTS in 1951, and he appointed Arzt as Israel Goldstein Professor of Practical Theology in 1962.

The Jewish Theological Seminary, JTS, is the primary educational and religious center of Conservative Judaism. The single largest physical addition to JTS came in the form of seventeen-foot wrought iron gates. The beautifully constructed gates led to the main entrance through a large vaulted passageway to the entire group of buildings. In a 1930s guidebook, it is written about the Seminary, &quot;Be sure to notice the main gate to the seminary as you go in. It is hand-wrought iron and the whole design is symbolic.&quot; These gates were presented on September 26, 1934, by Mrs. Frieda and Mr. Felix M. Warburg in memory of her parents, Jacob H. and Therese Schiff.

====Library fire====

In April 1966 JTS&#x27;s library caught fire. 70,000 books were destroyed, and many others were damaged.

===The Cohen era (1972–1986)===
Gerson D. Cohen became Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1972.

Prominent faculty during Cohen&#x27;s chancellorship included David Weiss Halivni of the Talmud Department and José Faur. Both of these scholars resigned when the JTS faculty voted to ordain women as rabbis and as cantors in 1983.

Yochanan Muffs, who had joined the JTS faculty in 1954, was a prominent professor of Bible. Max Kadushin, who had joined the JTS faculty in 1960, taught ethics and rabbinic thought until his death in 1980.

In 1972, Cohen appointed Avraham Holtz as the dean of academic development. Neil Gillman served as Dean of the JTS Rabbinical School for much of the Cohen chancellorship. Morton Leifman served as Dean of the Cantors Institute.

Cohen oversaw the appointment of Judith Hauptman as the first female professor of Talmud at JTS. Hauptman began teaching at JTS in 1973.

Joel Roth, who had begun teaching at JTS in 1968, was appointed Associate Professor of Talmud upon completing his Ph.D. at JTS in 1973. Roth went on to serve as the dean of the Rabbinical School from 1981 to 1984. He was succeeded by Gordon Tucker, who became dean of the Rabbinical School in 1984.

In June 1973, the Seminary&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities was granted permission to grant Ph.D. degrees in Jewish History, Bible, Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Hebrew. In 1975, the Seminary replaced the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities with the Graduate School of the Jewish Theological Seminary, which brought together JTS&#x27;s non-theological academic training programs. Cohen appointed historian Ismar Schorsch as the first dean of the Graduate School.

====Admission of female students====
Beginning in the 1970s, the topic of women&#x27;s ordination was regularly discussed at JTS. Women who unsuccessfully sought admission to the rabbinical school during the 1970s included Susannah Heschel, daughter of JTS faculty member Abraham Joshua Heschel. There was a special commission appointed by the chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (Gerson D. Cohen) to study the issue of ordaining women as rabbis, which met between 1977 and 1978, and consisted of 11 men and three women; the women were Marian Siner Gordon, an attorney, Rivkah Harris, an Assyriologist, and Francine Klagsbrun, a writer. After years of discussion, the JTS faculty voted to ordain women as rabbis and as cantors in 1983. The first female rabbi to graduate from the school (and the first female Conservative Jewish rabbi in the world) was Amy Eilberg, who graduated and was ordained as a rabbi in 1985. The first class of female rabbis that was admitted to JTS in 1984 included Rabbi Naomi Levy, who later became a best-selling author and Nina Beth Cardin, who became an author and environmental activist. Erica Lippitz and Marla Rosenfeld Barugel were the first women ordained as cantors by JTS (and the first female Conservative Jewish cantors in the world.) They were both ordained in 1987.

===Schorsch era (1986–2006)===
Ismar Schorsch became Chancellor of JTS in 1986.

Among his accomplishments was creating the William Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education, which was established through an endowment by William Davidson of Detroit in 1994.

Michael Greenbaum served as Vice Chancellor of The Jewish Theological Seminary.

Prominent faculty in the Talmud and Rabbinics department during Schorsch&#x27;s chancellorship included Joel Roth, Mayer Rabinowitz, David C. Kraemer and Judith Hauptman. Hauptman was the first woman appointed to teach Talmud at JTS. The Bible department included David Marcus and Stephen A. Geller. The Jewish literature Department included David G. Roskies. The Jewish history department included Jack Wertheimer and Shuly Rubin Schwartz. The Jewish Philosophy department included Neil Gillman and Shaul Magid. In 2004, Alan Mittleman joined the Jewish Philosophy department and became head of JTS&#x27;s Louis Finkelstein Institute for Religious and Social Studies.

The number of advanced programs in the Graduate School grew over the course of Schorsch&#x27;s tenure. The Graduate School came to describe itself as being &quot;the most extensive academic program in advanced Judaica in North America.&quot;

Gordon Tucker&#x27;s tenure as dean of the Rabbinical School ended in 1992. His predecessor, Joel Roth, again became dean, serving in 1992–1993. Roth was succeeded by William Lebeau, who served as dean from 1993–1999. Lebeau was succeeded by Alan Kensky, and then Lebeau became dean of the Rabbinical School again in June 2002.

In 1998, Henry Rosenblum was appointed Dean of the H.L. Miller Cantorial School and College of Jewish Music at the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1998, becoming the first Hazzan to hold that position. Rosenblum remained in this position until 2010.

===Eisen era (2007–2020)===
Arnold Eisen, Koshland Professor of Jewish Culture and Religion and Chair of the Department of Religious Studies at Stanford University, took office as Chancellor-elect on July 1, 2006, the day after Schorsch stepped down. Eisen assumed the position full-time on July 1, 2007.

Eisen is the second non-rabbi, after Cyrus Adler, to hold this post. He is also the first person with a social science background to serve as Chancellor; previous chancellors had backgrounds in Jewish history or Talmud.

In January 2007, at the start of Eisen&#x27;s chancellorship, Daniel S. Nevins was named the Dean of the Rabbinical School of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, succeeding Rabbi William Lebeau. Biblical scholar Alan Cooper was named Provost. In 2010, Henry Rosenblum left the H.L. Miller Cantorial School as part of JTS&#x27;s restructuring efforts, and Nevins also became responsible for oversight of the H.L. Miller Cantorial School.

In June 2009, Goldman Sachs executive Abby Joseph Cohen was named Chairman of the Board of JTS, the first woman to hold the position.

Also in 2009, with funding from the Charles H. Revson Foundation and the Booth Ferris Foundation, JTS established The Center for Pastoral Education with the goal of teaching the art of pastoral care to seminary students and ordained clergy of all faiths. The Center was developed by Rabbi Mychal Springer, formerly an Associate Dean of the Rabbinical School. Springer became the Center&#x27;s first director.

In 2010, the Tikvah Fund endowed a new institute at JTS, the Tikvah Institute for Jewish Thought, which is &quot;devoted to the intellectual encounter between the best sources of Jewish and broader Western reflection on the deepest problems of human life.&quot; According to the Seminary, &quot;JTS was selected by the Tikvah Fund based on its academic excellence and its mission to advance Jewish life in the modern world.&quot; Alan Mittleman, Chair of the Department of Jewish Thought, was appointed as its director.

Burton L. Visotzky was appointed to replace Mittleman as director of the Louis Finkelstein Institute for Religious and Social Studies. His early work as director of the Finkelstein Institute focused on Muslim-Jewish dialogue. In October 2010, a group of prominent Muslim and Jewish scholars and leaders, joined by the heads of several Christian seminaries, met at JTS for two days to discuss and compare the situations of Islam and Judaism in America.

In May 2011, Eisen launched &quot;Conservative Judaism: A Community Conversation,&quot; an interactive website featuring original essays on Conservative Judaism, with responses from Movement and Lay leaders and scholars.

====Admission of LGBT students====
Since March 2007, JTS has accepted openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual students into their rabbinical and cantorial programs (the seminary&#x27;s other three schools upheld such non-discrimination policies prior to this date). A survey conducted prior to the decision indicated that 58% of the rabbinical student body supported this change. The school issued a press release announcing the new admission policy, without taking a stance on same-sex unions. JTS marked the first anniversary of the change with a special program. Some students who opposed the change in admission policy said they felt excluded from the day&#x27;s program because it did not sufficiently recognize the pluralism in the student body. In April 2011, JTS held a Yom Iyyun, or day of learning, about LGBTQ issues, and their intersection with Judaism. Joy Ladin, a transgender woman who teaches English at Yeshiva University, gave a talk about her life. Other programs included creating welcoming communities, and inclusive prayer, among others. It was sponsored in part by Keshet, a Jewish LGBTQ social action group.

==JTS and the Conservative movement==
JTS was the founding institution of Conservative Judaism in America. The United Synagogue of America, the organization of Conservative synagogues, was founded by Solomon Schechter while he served as President of JTS. In the context of the pre-Finkelstein era, Orthodox Rabbi Nosson Scherman stated that &quot;in its early years the JTS was what today might be called Modern Orthodox.&quot;

During the chancellorship of Louis Finkelstein, however, there were many tensions between JTS and the Conservative Judaism movement which it led. JTS was often more traditional in matters of religious practice than the denomination as a whole. When Jacob Neusner applied to JTS during the Finkelstein era, in 1954, he like other applicants &quot;had to sign a pledge saying they would abide by traditional Jewish law.&quot; Finkelstein was also perceived as focusing on American and world Jewry as a whole while paying little attention to the Conservative movement.

According to scholar Michael Panitz, the situation changed under Finkelstein&#x27;s successors. Under Chancellor Gerson Cohen (chancellor from 1972–86), JTS &quot;decisively embraced its identity as a Conservative Jewish institution, it thereby abandoned its earlier hopes to provide a non-denominational unifier for traditional and moderate American Jews.&quot; The next chancellor, Ismar Schorsch (1986–2006), &quot;emerged as an outspoken advocate for Conservative Judaism.&quot; With the new mission statement introduced by Chancellor Arnold Eisen (2007-), the school has positioned itself as serving both &quot;Conservative Judaism&quot; and &quot;the vital religious center.&quot;

As of 2010, JTS&#x27;s website describes JTS as &quot;the academic and spiritual center of Conservative Judaism worldwide.&quot; Others describe it as &quot;the academic and spiritual centre of Conservative Judaism in the United States.&quot; A second important center for Conservative Judaism in the United States is the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies in California, founded by graduates of JTS in 1996.

==Current educational programs==
===Rabbinical School===
The Rabbinical School describes itself as offering &quot;an intensive program of study, personal growth, and spiritual development that leads to rabbinic ordination and a career of service to the Jewish community.&quot;

As of 2010, the rabbinical school requires five or six years of study. Its curriculum requires extensive study of Talmud, midrash, Bible, Jewish history, Hebrew language, and various professional skills. Students are required to spend the second year of the program at the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem.

Students must choose a field of concentration during their studies. Concentrations include:
*Bible
*Rabbinics
*Midrash
*Jewish history
*Jewish literature
*Jewish liturgy
*Jewish education
*Jewish philosophy
*Jewish women&#x27;s studies
*Pastoral care
===Cantorial school===
The cantorial school describes itself as training &quot;select advanced students as hazzanim (cantors) for congregational service or as teachers of Jewish music, choral directors, composers, or research scholars.&quot;

The school is technically divided into two parts: the entity formally known as the &quot;H. L. Miller Cantorial School&quot; invests students as hazzanim, while the entity known as the &quot;College of Jewish Music&quot; awards the master&#x27;s degree in Sacred Music. All students in the Cantorial School are enrolled in both programs simultaneously.

At present, the first year of cantorial school at JTS is generally spent in Israel. The curriculum during the five years focuses on three main areas: general music, Jewish music and Jewish text study.

===Graduate school===
The graduate school of the Jewish Theological Seminary offers academic programs in advanced Jewish studies. It describes itself as offering &quot;the most extensive academic program in advanced Judaic Studies in North America&quot;. The school grants MA, DHL, and PhD degrees in the areas of:
*Ancient Judaism
*Bible and Ancient Semitic Languages
*Interdepartmental Studies (MA only)
*Jewish Art and Visual Culture (MA only)
*Jewish History
*Jewish Literature
*Jewish philosophy
*Jewish Studies and Public Administration (MA only)
*Jewish Studies and Social Work (MA only)
*Jewish Women’s Studies (MA only)
*Liturgy
*Medieval Jewish Studies
*Midrash
*Modern Jewish Studies
*Talmud and Rabbinics
===William Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education===
In 1994, William Davidson of Detroit, Michigan established a $15 million endowment at JTS to fund the William Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education, which trains educators who can serve in Jewish institutions and elsewhere, in both formal and informal settings. The Davidson School offers both master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees.

===List College===

Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies (List College) is the undergraduate school of JTSA. It is closely affiliated with Columbia University; almost all List College students are enrolled in dual-degree programs with either Columbia University’s School of General Studies or Barnard College.

==Additional institutes at JTS==
* Tikvah Institute for Jewish Thought – devoted to the intellectual encounter between the best sources of Jewish and broader Western reflection on the deepest problems of human life.

Released on October 9, 1992, &quot;Under Siege&quot; was both a critical and commercial success, receiving two Academy Award nominations for sound production and grossing over $156.6 million at the global box office. It is often considered Steven Seagal&#x27;s best film to date. It was followed in 1995 by a sequel, &quot;Under Siege 2: Dark Territory&quot;, which was not as well received.

&quot;Under Siege&quot; was the final film of actor Patrick O&#x27;Neal, before his death in 1994.

== Plot ==
The battleship arrives at Pearl Harbor, where then-President George H. W. Bush announces that the ship will be decommissioned in California. Casey Ryback, a chief petty officer and a culinary specialist, is preparing meals to celebrate commanding officer Captain Adams&#x27; birthday, against the orders of executive officer Commander Krill, who has arranged for food and entertainment to be brought by helicopter. Krill provokes a tussle with Ryback. Unable to imprison Ryback in the brig without the captain&#x27;s approval, Krill detains him in the walk-in fridge, placing Marine Private Nash on guard. The helicopter arrives with a musical band and caterers, accompanied by &quot; Playboy&quot; Playmate Jordan Tate.

The band and caterers are mercenaries led by disillusioned former CIA operative William Strannix, who, aided by Krill, takes over the ship. Several officers are killed, including Captain Adams. The surviving crew are imprisoned in the forecastle, with some stragglers confined in unsecured areas. Ryback hears the gunshots and persuades Nash to call the bridge. Strannix sends two mercenaries to eliminate Ryback and Nash. Nash is killed, but Ryback slays both mercenaries. He encounters Tate and reluctantly allows her to tag along.

Strannix and his mercenaries seize the ship&#x27;s weapon systems, shooting down a jet sent to investigate; they plan to cover their escape with missiles to obliterate tracking systems in Pearl Harbor. Strannix&#x27;s mission is to steal the ship&#x27;s Tomahawks and load them onto a hijacked North Korean submarine as revenge for the CIA attempting to assassinate him.

Strannix contacts Admiral Bates at the Pentagon to make demands but learns Ryback has escaped. Krill discovers Ryback is a former Navy SEAL with extensive training in counterterrorism tactics; Captain Adams had taken Ryback aboard as his cook after Ryback was demoted for striking a superior officer who provided inadequate intel for a failed mission in Panama. Ryback contacts Bates, who says a Navy SEAL team is underway to retake the ship. Ryback, helped by Tate, moves throughout the ship, eliminating mercenaries. Krill activates the fire suppression system to flood the forecastle and force Ryback to rescue his mates while setting an ambush.

Ryback and Tate release 6 imprisoned sailors. They overcome the ambush and shut off the water flooding the forecastle. Ryback shuts down &quot;Missouri&quot;″s weapon systems to allow incoming Navy SEALs to land, but the submarine crew shoots down the helicopter carrying the team. The Pentagon orders an air strike that will sink the &quot;Missouri&quot;. Strannix regains control of the ship&#x27;s weapon systems and loads the Tomahawks onto the submarine. Aided by a gunner&#x27;s mate, Ryback attacks the submarine using the battleship&#x27;s 16-inch guns, killing Krill and everyone on board.

His plan foiled, Strannix launches two retaliatory nuclear-tipped Tomahawks towards Honolulu. As the sailors retake the ship, Ryback enters the control room and encounters Strannix. Ryback kills Strannix in a knife fight and then uses the launch code disk to destroy the Tomahawk missiles. A jet obliterates one missile, and the other is deactivated; the Navy calls off its airstrike.

The remaining crew are released as the ship sails to San Francisco harbor. A funeral ceremony for Captain Adams is held aboard the &quot;Missouri&quot;, with Tate amongst the crew. Ryback salutes the captain&#x27;s casket in his formal dress uniform with full decorations.

== Production ==

=== Development and pre-production ===
The film was based on an original spec script by J. F. Lawton called &quot;Dreadnought&quot; which sold for $1 million. Warners wanted Seagal to star in the film but he turned it down at first. Seagal later said he had problems with the role of a character &quot;who is at first a bimbo jumping out of a cake and gets paired up with me.&quot; But he said that in revisions of the script, the role became a character &quot;who gradually reveals her intelligence.&quot;

Lawton said &quot;We are trying to make him [Seagal] more mainstream...getting him out of the pure action genre and into an acting role.&quot; The writer added &quot;I&#x27;m trying to bring the budget within a reasonable range. The original script was almost irresponsible, with things like battleships getting blown up...the way it was, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; would have cost $100 million-plus to make. Now we&#x27;re looking at the $30 million range... It was Steven&#x27;s idea to fit the Pearl Harbor Memorial into the film, because all these incredible ships would be there—a spectacular sight.&quot;

Seagal originally wanted to direct the film himself.

Director Andrew Davis had previously made &quot;Above the Law&quot; with Steven Seagal. Davis later said &quot;Terry Semel wanted us to get back together again saying that Seagal was only in the movie 41 minutes. Tommy Lee is in the movie longer than Steven. It was fine, it was fine. It worked out well. We had a nice time down in Mobile and had a lot of fun making the movie, and that was the movie that got me &quot;The Fugitive&quot; so it was worth it.&quot;

In a 2018 interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Pamela Anderson claimed that she was a contender for the role of Jordan Tate, but was dropped after refusing to sleep with Seagal. Gary Busey claimed in later interviews that Seagal sexually harassed Erika Eleniak, who co-starred with Anderson on &quot;Baywatch&quot;, on set. Eleniak has stated that Seagal never acted inappropriately with her during casting or filming.

=== Filming ===
 (serving as a museum in Mobile) stood in for many of the &quot;Missouri&quot; sequences, and (museum ship) portrayed the North Korean submarine. The film also featured footage of the real &quot;Missouri&quot; sailing in Pearl Harbor, the Pacific Ocean, and San Francisco Bay. The war room sequences were filmed inside of a set constructed in a local high school gymnasium.

The film makes extensive use of the Introvision process, a variation of front projection that allows realistic three-dimensional interaction of foreground characters with projected backgrounds without the heavy cost of traditional bluescreen effects. The technique was also used in the films &quot;Outland&quot;, &quot;Megaforce&quot;, &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; and Andrew Davis&#x27; later film, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.

&quot;Most people are surprised that the film is as sophisticated as it is,&quot; Davis said. &quot;It appeals to people who have a point of view about nuclear weapons and the story thrusts you into an incredible situation that is not far-fetched.&quot; When the original title &quot;Dreadnought&quot; did not test well with audiences, the marketing department wanted to give the film a three word title like other Seagal films and came up with the title &quot;Last to Surrender&quot;. Lawton and Seagal both hated the title, and Seagal fought to have it changed, and the film ended up with the title &quot;Under Siege&quot;.

Robert Booth Nichols, a self-described former espionage artist, alleged mob associate, and con artist, was employed by Seagal as a technical advisor. He also appears in the film in a small speaking role.

Casey Ryback&#x27;s signature knives were designed for the film by Gil Hibben.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
On its opening weekend, &quot;Under Siege&quot; made $15,760,003 from 2,042 theaters, with a $7,717 average. From there, it went on to make $83,563,139. Worldwide, it made $156,563,139. At the time, it was the most successful film that had not been screened for any critics prior to its release.

=== Critical response ===
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale. Reviewers praised Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey&#x27;s performances as the film&#x27;s villains. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 80% based on reviews from 30 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A well-directed action thriller that makes the most of its confined setting, &quot;Under Siege&quot; marks a high point for early &#x27;90s action—and its star&#x27;s spotty filmography.&quot; This is one of the few Steven Seagal films to receive a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, along with &quot;Executive Decision&quot; and &quot;Machete&quot;, being called &quot;&quot;Die Hard&quot; on a battleship&quot; by film critics. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.
It was also the only Seagal movie to receive an Academy Award nomination, earning two nominations for Best Sound Effects Editing (John Leveque and Bruce Stambler) and for Best Sound (Donald O. Mitchell, Frank A. Montaño, Rick Hart and Scott D. Smith). It did not win in either category, losing to &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; and &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. Harrison Ford saw a rough cut of the film and approved director Andrew Davis for &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993).

===Sequel===
A sequel, &quot;Under Siege 2: Dark Territory&quot;, was released on July 14, 1995, with Seagal, Romano, Mancuso and Dye reprising their roles. The film failed to replicate the success of its predecessor.

===Reboot===
In November 2021, a reboot of the original was in development for HBO Max, with Timo Tjahjanto and Umair Aleem attached to direct and write the film.

<text>Out for Justice is a 1991 American neo-noir action thriller film directed by John Flynn and co-produced by and starring Steven Seagal as Gino Felino, a veteran police detective who sets out to avenge his partner Bobby&#x27;s murder by killing Richie, the trigger-happy, drug-addicted mafioso culprit. The film was released theatrically on April 12, 1991.

==Plot==
Gino Felino is an NYPD detective from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, who has strong ties within his neighborhood. Gino and his partner Bobby Lupo wait to bust up a multimillion-dollar drug deal, but Gino sees a pimp violently assaulting one of his girls and intervenes. Shortly afterward, Richie Madano murders Bobby, shooting him multiple times in broad daylight in front of his wife, Laurie, and his two children.

Richie is a crack addict who grew up with Gino and Bobby. He has become psychotic and homicidal due to rage and drug use, and seems not to care about the consequences of his actions. After killing Bobby, Richie kills a woman at random, shooting her in the head at a traffic stop when she tells him to move his car. He then heads off into Brooklyn alongside his goons, who are horrified by what he does, but continue to work alongside him.

Gino knows that Richie is not going to leave the neighborhood. Ronnie Donziger, his captain, gives him the clearance for a manhunt and provides him with a shotgun and an unmarked car. Gino visits his mob connection Frankie and his boss Don Vittorio, and he tells them he will not get out of the way of their own plans to take out Richie, whom they view as a loose cannon. While driving, Gino sees a fellow driver discard something moving from his car. Upon investigating, Gino rescues an abandoned German Shepherd puppy.

Gino starts the hunt for Richie at a bar run by Richie&#x27;s brother Vinnie Madano. Vinnie and his friends all refuse to provide information, so Gino beats up a number of them. He still does not find out where Richie is, but his concern about getting an attitude problem has been taken care of. Gino attempts to get Richie out of hiding by arresting his sister Pattie and by talking to his estranged, elderly father.

Gino and his wife, Vicky, who are in the middle of a divorce, decide to reconcile. They, along with their son, Tony, are attacked by Richie&#x27;s men who storm into their apartment. Gino kills them all and saves his wife and son. Richie later comes back to the bar and beats up Vinnie for not killing Gino when the situation was one cop against a bar full of armed men. He also has information leaked to the mob that he is at the bar, then emerges from hiding and ambushes the mob&#x27;s hitmen in a shoot-out.

After visiting a number of local hangouts and establishments trying to find information, Gino discovers Richie killed Bobby because Bobby was having an affair with two women – Richie&#x27;s girlfriend, Roxanne Ford, and a waitress named Terry Malloy. When Gino goes to Roxanne&#x27;s home, he finds she is dead. Gino believes that Richie killed Roxanne before he killed Bobby. Gino goes to Laurie&#x27;s house and tells the widow what is going on. In Laurie&#x27;s purse, Gino finds the picture that Richie dropped on Bobby&#x27;s body after killing him. Bobby turns out to have been a corrupt cop who had wanted a money-making lifestyle like Richie&#x27;s, and Laurie knew Bobby was corrupt. Laurie had found a picture of Bobby and Roxanne having sex. She had given Richie the picture out of jealousy, never expecting Richie to kill Bobby for sleeping with Roxanne. Laurie took the picture away from where Richie dropped it on Bobby because she wanted to protect her husband&#x27;s reputation.

Following a tip from his local snitch Picolino, Gino eventually finds Richie in a house in the old neighborhood having a party. Gino kills or wounds all of Richie&#x27;s men. Gino then finds Richie and fights him hand-to-hand. After beating Richie senseless, Gino finally kills him by stabbing him in the forehead with a corkscrew. The mobsters arrive soon after, also intent on killing Richie. Gino uses the lead mobster&#x27;s gun to shoot the already-dead Richie several times, then tells him to return to his boss and take credit for Richie&#x27;s death.

Gino and his wife adopt the puppy as a family pet, naming him Coraggio (Italian for courage or bravery). Whilst visiting Coney Island, they encounter the same man who abandoned the puppy earlier, and Gino confronts him. When the man attacks him, Gino defends himself, knocking the man down by kicking him in the testicles. Gino and his wife laugh as the puppy urinates on the man&#x27;s head.

==Production==
John Flynn later claimed the original title was &quot;The Price of Our Blood&quot;, &quot;meaning Mafia blood. That was the title that Steven and I wanted, but Warner Bros. said no. It had to be a three-word title like the other Steven Seagal films (&quot;Above the Law&quot;, &quot;Hard to Kill&quot;, and &quot;Marked for Death&quot;).&quot;

The movie was originally much longer and included more plot and characters. Seagal cut some of William Forsythe&#x27;s scenes because he felt that Forsythe was upstaging him. Also, Warner Bros. brought in editor Michael Eliot to re-edit the original cut of the movie so that it would be shorter and more profitable at the box office. Eliot did the same job on a few other Warner Bros. movies - Wes Craven&#x27;s sci-fi horror &quot;Deadly Friend&quot; (1986) and Mark L. Lester&#x27;s action movie &quot;Showdown in Little Tokyo&quot; (1991). Some scenes were deleted, and some others were cut for pacing, so two montage scenes with no dialogue are in the movie. Re-editing also caused some minor continuity mistakes. The theatrical trailer shows two deleted scenes: Richie shooting inside a clothing store from which he took a new shirt (in his first few scenes, he is wearing one shirt, then all of a sudden, he is wearing another shirt for the rest of the movie), and a scene where the police captain tells Gino that body count is going up. Some TV versions of the movie included two deleted scenes: Richie stealing the new shirt from store because he got blood on it (also seen in trailer), and Richie and his guys breaking into the house where Gino&#x27;s wife is and trying to find her, but leaving when some neighbors show up. Flynn later recalled:

I really liked working with Bill Forsythe and Jerry Orbach and all those guys in the car who played the killers. But I didn&#x27;t get along with Steven. He was always about an hour late for work and caused a lot of delays. We shot until October 31, 1990, because an IATSE strike was threatened. (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts - Ed.) Warner Bros. told us we had to be on a plane by November 1. So we shot for about a month in Brooklyn. The rest of &quot;Out for Justice&quot; was shot in and around south Los Angeles. We filmed those scenes on Lacy Street, in a slummy area of old wooden buildings that could pass for Brooklyn.

===The Seagal/LeBell incident===
While on the production set, Seagal allegedly stated that due to his aikido training he was &quot;immune&quot; to being choked unconscious. It has been said that at some point, judo master Gene LeBell (who was a stunt coordinator for the movie), heard about the claim and gave Seagal the opportunity to prove it. LeBell is said to have placed his arms around Seagal&#x27;s neck, and once Seagal said &quot;go&quot;, proceeded to choke him unconscious, with Seagal losing control of his bowels. The popularity of this incident led LeBell to be counted in 1992 as a potential additional member of Robert Wall&#x27;s controversial &quot;Dirty Dozen,&quot; a group of martial artists willing to answer to a public challenge made by Seagal. LeBell was requested to confirm the story publicly in an interview with Ariel Helwani in 2012, but he avoided answering the question, albeit implying that the incident was true. He was quoted as saying: &quot;When we had a little altercation or difference of opinion, there were thirty stuntmen and cameramen that were watching. Sometimes Steven has a tendency to cheese off the wrong people, and you can get hurt doing that.&quot; After being asked whether he was not going to directly confirm it, LeBell said: &quot;Well, if thirty people are watching, let them talk about it.&quot; When Seagal was asked about the incident, he denied the incident took place, calling LeBell a &quot;sick, pathological scumbag liar&quot; and offered the name of a witness who could discredit the other account. Seagal bodyguard and stuntman Steven Lambert stated he was present and said that a confrontation did happen. According to Lambert, Seagal explained to LeBell that he did not believe his choke hold was effective, and that he could escape from it. LeBell demonstrated the choke hold by putting it on Seagal. Before LeBell could lock the hold, however, Seagal side stepped and swung his forearm backward into his crotch. LeBell came off the floor by a few feet. As soon as he landed, LeBell used a foot sweep to sweep Seagal off the floor, with Seagal landing on his back. LeBell helped Seagal up.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Out for Justice&quot; debuted at number one for the U.S. box office, the third straight Seagal movie to do so. It eventually grossed $40 million, about a third less than his prior movie, &quot;Marked for Death&quot;.

===Critical response===
The movie received generally negative reviews. It was originally rated NC-17 for its brutal and graphic violence. Several cuts were made for the film&#x27;s release overseas. In the United Kingdom in particular, several of the gruesome action scenes were trimmed for the video release, cutting the duration by 54 seconds. It was later released uncut for DVD. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 23% based on reviews from 22 critics. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 38 out of 100 based on reviews from 12 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

<text>On Deadly Ground is a 1994 American environmental action adventure film directed, co-produced by, and starring Steven Seagal, and co-starring Michael Caine, Joan Chen, John C. McGinley and R. Lee Ermey. As of 2024, it is Seagal&#x27;s only directorial effort and features a minor appearance by Billy Bob Thornton in one of his early roles. Seagal plays Forrest Taft, an expert firefighter who chooses to fight back against the environmental destruction caused by his ruthless former employer (Caine). &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on February 18, 1994, by Warner Bros. It garnered negative reviews from critics and grossed $78.1 million worldwide on a $50 million production budget.

==Plot==
Aegis Oil owns various oil refineries and rigs in Alaska, where the company faces great opposition from the public due to the increasing environmental damage done by its operations. Aegis had purchased the oil production rights from the local Tribal Council 20 years prior; however, the rights will revert to the natives if Aegis 1, the company&#x27;s newest oil platform and biggest refinery, is not online within a certain deadline. In order to make the deadline in the face of multiple delays, CEO Michael Jennings forces his workers to use substandard parts.

Foreman Hugh Palmer&#x27;s rig suffers a blowout due to the faulty parts. Trained firefighter Forrest Taft extinguishes the blaze. However, they have become suspicious of their company&#x27;s consistently poor safety record. Taft manages to hack into the company&#x27;s computer files and learn about the faulty parts. After being informed of Palmer&#x27;s efforts to alert the Environmental Protection Agency and of Taft&#x27;s access to restricted files, Jennings arranges for both of them to be eliminated by his Chief Security Officer, MacGruder and his assistant Otto. The two ransack Palmer&#x27;s cabin and brutally torture and murder him when he refuses to cooperate. Meanwhile, Taft is ordered by Jennings to head over to another accident site, but realizes too late that the damaged building has been rigged as a booby trap. Taft narrowly survives the ensuing explosion and is rescued by Masu, the daughter of Yupik tribe chief Silook.

At the behest of Silook, Taft undergoes a vision quest in which he sees the full truth and vows to make amends for his part in Aegis&#x27;s crimes. Meanwhile, the Aegis security team tracks Taft to Silook&#x27;s village and when the tribe turns them down, a confrontation ensues, ending with MacGruder fatally shooting Silook. Taft returns in time to have one last talk with Silook before he succumbs to his wounds, vowing to avenge him and bring down Aegis.

Taft and Masu make their way to Palmer&#x27;s cabin. While gathering supplies, they find his incriminating disk containing proof of Aegis&#x27;s crimes. Otto and three Aegis security guards track the pair back to the cabin. Taft ambushes the party, quickly killing all of them. Jennings then deploys a squad of mercenaries led by an older man code-named &quot;Stone&quot;, but Taft manages to evade the group by killing several of the members with booby traps and blowing up a shack which obliterates a helicopter, effectively finishing their pursuit.

Taft and Masu collect weapons and explosives and proceed to sneak into the refinery complex. Taft sabotages Aegis 1 by killing the main power and forcing a reboot, then releasing hydrochloric acid gas inside the refinery. He then plants a series of C-4 explosive charges onto several oil tanks and in the control room and sets them to a timer.

Jennings has already arrived at the refinery to check on it when he gets word of Taft&#x27;s infiltration and orders his henchmen to find and kill him. Taft fights and eventually eliminates every opposing mercenary (including MacGruder and Stone) using firearms, a steel pipe, and even burning gasoline. He then confronts and corners Jennings, condemning him for his greed and corruption. As Jennings attempts to escape, Taft lassos one of his legs with a cable, puts it on a hook and shoots the cable, sending Jennings to his death into a pool of oil sludge below. He and Masu then escape the rig just as the hidden C-4 charges detonate, causing a chain of explosions that ravages the entire plant. They flee the exploding refinery in an Aegis truck, escaping as Aegis 1 is torn down by the fire. Later, Taft, far from being arrested for industrial sabotage and multiple murders, delivers a speech at the Alaska State Capitol about the dangers of oil pollution and the companies that are endangering the ecosystem.

===Critical response===
&quot;On Deadly Ground&quot; received negative reviews from critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

At the time of its release, Gene Siskel included the film in his &quot;Worst of&quot; list for 1994, singling out the melancholy tone of the film and the quality of Seagal&#x27;s dialogue. On their syndicated TV show &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, Siskel called the film&#x27;s pyrotechnics &quot;low rent&quot; and stated that he &quot;didn&#x27;t think the fight sequences were anything special.&quot; He noted that Seagal&#x27;s speech at the end was &quot;more interesting than the actual fighting.&quot;

Roger Ebert, for his part, stated the movie was &quot;limited to two basic qualities: it&#x27;s violent and it&#x27;s sanctimonious&quot;, and opined that while &quot;it doesn&#x27;t pay to devote close attention to the plot&quot;, &quot;if you like to see lots of stuff blowed up real good, then this&#x27;ll be a movie for you.&quot; His opinion on the ending speech was that it was &quot;absurd&quot;, stating, &quot;at the end after Seagal kills about 30 people and blowing up the largest oil refinery in the world, what happens? He&#x27;s invited to the Alaska State Legislature to give a talk about ecology. I&#x27;m not sure, but blowing up oil refineries does not make you that popular in Alaska.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; film critic Leonard Klady referred to the film as &quot;a vanity production parading as a social statement&quot; and commented that the film seemingly borrowed heavily from the earlier film &quot;Billy Jack&quot;, but opined that Seagal lacked &quot;acting technique and the ability behind the camera to keep the story simple and direct&quot; that &quot;Billy Jack&quot; star Tom Laughlin exhibited. Like Siskel, Klady also singled out the speech by Seagal&#x27;s character at the end of the film.

In the 1996 movie guide &quot;Seen That, Now What?&quot;, the film was given the rating of &quot;C−&quot;, stating &quot;This combination action/environmental rights movie is an interesting hybrid in concept, but a filmic mess in execution, including embarrassing Eskimo shaman scenes and well-meaning lecture-finale on endangered species.&quot;

&quot;Seagalogy&quot; author Vern considers &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot; to be one of Seagal&#x27;s defining works, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s the corniest, most unintentionally hilarious movie of his career... But it&#x27;s also Seagal&#x27;s most sincere and his most ballsy,&quot; going on to claim, &quot;You can&#x27;t understand Seagal if you haven&#x27;t seen &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot;.&quot; He points out that many of the most important themes and motifs that define Seagal&#x27;s work are present in the film, and more overtly so than in any of his other films.

Caine&#x27;s American accent in the film, which &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described as that of a &quot;Texan that had been brought up in the mean streets of London,&quot; has made several &quot;worst movie accent&quot; lists.

===Box office===
The film grossed $38.6 million in the United States and Canada and $78.1 million worldwide against its reported $50 million budget.

===Accolades===
The film received six Golden Raspberry Awards nominations and won in the Worst Director category. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

<doc id="67422" wikidata="Q1142051" url="?curid=67422" title="Executive Decision">
<text>Executive Decision is a 1996 American action thriller film directed by Stuart Baird (in his directorial debut) and written by Jim Thomas and John Thomas, who also produced the film with Joel Silver. It stars Kurt Russell, Steven Seagal, Halle Berry, John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt, Joe Morton, David Suchet and B.D. Wong. It depicts the rescue of an airliner hijacked by terrorists, by a small team placed on the plane in mid-flight. The film was released in the United States on March 15, 1996, by Warner Bros. It grossed $122 million against a $55 million budget. The film is famous for Steven Seagal&#x27;s short onscreen time and his death early into the movie.

== Plot ==
In May 1995, Lieutenant Colonel Austin Travis leads an unsuccessful Special Forces black ops raid on a Chechen mafia safe house in Trieste, Italy, to recover a stolen Soviet nerve agent, DZ-5. Three months later, Oceanic Airlines Flight 343, a Boeing 747-200, leaves Athens bound for Washington, D.C., with more than 400 passengers aboard including Nagi Hassan, lieutenant of the imprisoned terrorist leader El Sayed Jaffa. Hassan and his men hijack the flight, demanding Jaffa&#x27;s release. Meanwhile, just moments before the hijacking, a suicide bomber working for Jaffa destroys a London Marriott hotel restaurant.

Dr. David Grant, the U.S. Army intelligence consultant behind the botched raid, is summoned to a meeting at the Pentagon to plan an operation to retake the plane. Grant doubts Hassan&#x27;s demands, suspecting he engineered Jaffa&#x27;s capture, and intends to use the 747 to detonate a bomb loaded with the DZ-5 in U.S. airspace. The Pentagon authorizes a mid-air insertion of Travis&#x27; special operations team onto the hijacked airliner using the experimental &quot;Remora F117x&quot; aircraft. Grant and DARPA engineer Dennis Cahill reluctantly join the mission.

The Remora intercepts and docks with the airliner. Grant, Cahill, and team members Cappy, Baker, Louie and Rat successfully board but Cappy is injured after a fall. Severe turbulence strains the docking tunnel. Travis sacrifices himself by closing the 747&#x27;s hatch before it decompresses. The Remora is destroyed along with the team&#x27;s communications equipment, leaving the Pentagon unaware of their survival. They conduct a covert search for the bomb, hoping to neutralize it and storm the cabin. Grant accidentally reveals his presence to flight attendant Jean, but successfully recruits her to assist their search, despite Hassan&#x27;s suspicions.

The team locates the bomb and Cappy, despite his injuries, guides Cahill in disarming it until they discover its arming device has an additional, remote-controlled trigger. Jaffa, released by U.S officials in an attempt to resolve the situation, calls Hassan from a private jet to tell him he is on his way to Algeria, but Hassan abruptly ends the call. Grant and the others realize Hassan&#x27;s men are unaware of the bomb and Hassan&#x27;s true intentions, after he kills one of them for rebuking him. He also inadvertently reveals that one of the passengers is a sleeper agent and the trigger-man for the bomb.

The Pentagon dispatches U.S. Navy F-14 Tomcats to shoot down the 747, prompting Hassan to execute passenger U.S. Senator Jason Mavros as a warning. Baker uses Morse code via the 747&#x27;s taillights to signal the fighters that the team made it aboard, requesting an extra ten minutes to neutralize the bomb and retake the 747, despite already crossing into U.S. airspace. Jean spots a man with an electronic device and informs Grant, who enters the passenger cabin to take the suspected individual by surprise, only to find he is merely a diamond thief. Grant spots the real sleeper, Demou, and fights him for the detonator. Hassan attempts to shoot Grant, but is himself shot by an on-board air marshal.

The commandos storm the cabin as a firefight ensues. Grant struggles to wrestle the detonator from Demou&#x27;s grip while Baker and Rat gun down several terrorists. Louie assists Grant by fatally shooting Demou and eliminating the remaining terrorists. Demou, however, manages to arm the bomb before dying, and stray bullets from a terrorist&#x27;s weapon pierce a window causing explosive decompression. The bomb is disarmed just in time by Cappy and Cahill as the 747 stabilizes. Hassan kills the pilots and damages the controls, before being shot and killed by Rat.

Despite his limited flying experience and poor flying technique, Grant takes control of the 747 and attempts a landing but misses the approach to Dulles International Airport. Now flying north over Maryland, Grant recognizes the area surrounding his training airfield, Frederick Field, and opts to attempt to land the 747 there. With Jean&#x27;s assistance, Grant successfully lands the airliner and the passengers are safely evacuated. Grant is saluted by Baker, Louie, Rat and Cappy for his leadership before being summoned to the Pentagon.

Steven Seagal says that he was enticed to accept the unusual role of Austin Travis by a hefty salary, which amounted to around a million dollars per day spent on the shoot. He also found some satisfaction in knowing that his character&#x27;s unexpected fate would shock the audience, and therefore did not regret taking the role.

Exterior shots of the Boeing 747 were done using models and two real aircraft. Grant McCune Design constructed two models for actual shooting, one model to test the rig, one complete lower half for closeups of the landing gear extension sequence, and one 1/12 scale nose section for the stealth docking sequence. Two models of the Remora were also made at 1/6 scale, one for the docking sequence with a motion controlled snorkel and articulated hatch and another for post dock sequences. An ex-Kuwait Airways 747-269BM belonging to Kalitta Air (registration N707CK) was featured in most of the in-flight shots, while a Corsair 747-121 (externally identical to the 747-200) formerly owned by Pan Am was used for closeups of the aircraft in the aftermath of the crash landing at the end. The latter aircraft was stored in the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California, after filming wrapped up and was subsequently scrapped in 1998. The F-14s featured in the film came from the VF-84 &quot;Jolly Rogers&quot; squadron. This would be VF-84&#x27;s last Hollywood appearance before disestablishment.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 62% based on reviews from 42 critics, with an average rating of 6.30/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Executive Decision&quot; adheres entertainingly to classic action thriller formula, proving a genre outing doesn&#x27;t need to win points for originality to be solidly effective.&quot; On Metacritic the film has an approval rating of 62 out of 100, based on reviews from 20 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Leonard Maltin called it &quot;a tense, inventive thriller&quot; which needed more editing. Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;The picture&#x27;s logic may be a bit fast and loose, but its action-and-excitement quotient is top-notch.&quot; Roger Ebert rated it 3 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;a gloriously goofy mess of a movie&quot; with several plot holes (e.g. smuggling a toxin into the country would likely be easier and just as effective as hijacking). Ebert praised the first-act plot twist of killing off the character played by Seagal, then a major Hollywood star: &quot;I perked right up&quot;.

===Accolades===
Halle Berry earned a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Actress – Adventure/Drama for her performance in the film in 1997. Steven Seagal earned a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actor for his performance in the film but lost to Marlon Brando for &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot;.

== Other versions ==
The European theatrical version of the film was edited by the studio in order to remove reference to Islam. The original US version was the source of the DVD in that country, while the European version was used worldwide as the source for the Blu-ray HD master.

<doc id="67424" wikidata="Q688425" url="?curid=67424" title="Steyr-Puch Haflinger">
<text>The Haflinger is a small, lightweight, four wheel drive, high mobility cab over vehicle about 2.8 m long (3.15 m for the long wheelbase version) and 1.3 m wide, powered by a 643 cc horizontally opposed flat twin, rear mounted air-cooled engine. Weighing around 635 kg (1400 lb), the Haflinger can be lifted by four strong people and yet can carry a load of 515 kg (1135.3 lb). This truck falls into the category of the light utility vehicle. It was produced between 1959 and 1974 by the Austrian manufacturer Steyr-Daimler-Puch.


==History==

After WWII, the newly organized Austrian Army was equipped with the surplus US Army Willys MB and Ford GPW Jeep. A decade after hostilities ended, the Austrian Army was considering the retirement of the aging Jeeps in favor of something more contemporary as well as locally designed and produced. The design genius of Erich Ledwinka (son of legendary Tatra designer and father of the Volkswagen Beetle Hans Ledwinka) was utilized by the Austrian firm Steyr-Daimler-Puch to produce and field test prototypes. Its extensive similarities with the larger Tatra all wheel drive trucks are obvious, it has even been referred to as &#x27;A little Tatra&#x27;. Once the production model design was finalized, the trucks were manufactured between 1959 and 1974 and were exported all over the world. The manufacturer designated the trucks as &quot;Type Multipurpose Passenger Vehicle&quot;. A total of 16,647 were made. (See Military Use below.) 

The majority of the Haflinger trucks entered directly into the hands of private owners around the world with a small number also being placed into municipal, ambulance and fire brigade services. Like its predecessor, the US Army Jeep, Haflinger trucks are at home both off and on road. They have been licensed for on-road use throughout Europe, North and South America, Asia, Africa and Australia. During their 16-year production run they were sold in Austria and exported to 35 other countries. The first trucks to see use in the United States arrived in 1960. In 1983 one was driven from Vermont to California, while Austrian travel journalist Ernst Wiese in his book &quot;10,000 Miles Through Arabia&quot; described his four-month return journey from Vienna to the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. Its multi-functional capabilities meant it was described as a car, a truck and the &quot;Austrian Jeep&quot;.

==Military use==

Approximately 7,000 Haflingers were recruited into military service by the Swiss, Austrian and Australian armies and the Royal Navy. Small numbers were also in use in Katanga and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1960s.

In Australian Army service the 46 Haflinger vehicles were each equipped with a dedicated trailer unit. Haflinger were often allocated to RAEME units where typically an individual craftsman, like artillery artificers, would use the vehicle to carry tools and other equipment around the field attending to technical servicing of weapons platforms and fighting vehicles.

Haflinger, Steyr Puch, is not listed in the table of Australian Army vehicles in Vietnam within the M Cecil book &quot;Mud &amp; Dust&quot;, but a popular misconception may have occurred because of the US M274 Mechanical Mule which has a similar size and mechanical arrangement and was used to carry munitions and other equipment.

==Features==

Particular features that add to the off-road capability include:
* Exceptionally low centre of gravity due to the low placement of the chassis and the lack of upper bodywork
* Generous approach and departure angles
* The provision of both front and rear differential locks enables the vehicle to make progress even if only one wheel is in firm contact with the ground.
* The &#x27;portal&#x27; type design of the front and rear axles means that the centre of the axle is above the centre of the wheel, thus increasing ground clearance under the axle without the need to increase the wheel diameter. Power is transmitted from the axle to the wheel via drop gears in each wheel hub.
* The suspension is fully independent, of the swing axle type both front and rear, each half-axle having about 25 cm of free movement.

==Haflinger fans==

Most enthusiasts are found in Germany and Austria, where there are thriving clubs. There are also many owners/enthusiasts in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, and Asia. One of the more important club meetings is held every year at the village of Hafling (Avelengo) in Italy.

Vintage Haflingers in good conditions are sought after by collectors and car enthusiasts and command high prices on the used car market.

==Trivia==

Haflingers feature in the 1971 Doctor Who story Colony in Space, the location filming for which took place in a clay pit in Cornwall.

Steyr subsequently designed and produced a much larger vehicle of very similar layout to the Haflinger, called the Pinzgauer, which is available in both 4x4 and 6x6 versions.

The name originates from a horse breed of the same name.

Steyr Puch stood alone and had no input from the Daimler-Benz, i.e. Mercedes-Benz, until well after the production of Haflinger ceased.

Steyr Puch was an important light motorcycle manufacturer.

Their expertise in 4WD attracted Mercedes-Benz and they built the first G Wagens (Geländewagen) that were intended as an alternative to the military specification Land Rover. When Mercedes invested in Steyr Puch they started building both Puch and Mercedes badged vehicles.

G Wagens serve in the French Army albeit with Peugeot engines. Under Australian Department of Defence project Land 121 Mercedes-Benz G-Class have been introduced into Australian Army service to replace the ageing Land Rover Perentie

Note: The term &#x27;G-Wagen&#x27; is only used in English-speaking parts of the world. It is originally called &#x27;G-Klasse&#x27; (&#x27;G-Class&#x27;), similar to the C-, E-, M-, R-, and S-Klasse in MB&#x27;s nomenclature.

Also the links with Fiat were maintained as Steyr Puch made all the 4WD kit for the Panda and may still do to this day.

== Variants ==
The Haflinger changed very little during its years of production, but there are some notable changes and variants along the way:
* Series 1: original model, 4-speed gearbox
* Series 2: 5-speed gearbox (crawler gear) and a higher output engine
* Polycab: upper steel bodywork optionally replaced with a fully enclosed fibreglass cab
* SchneeWiesel: &quot;Snow Weasel&quot; with tires replaced by tracks for snow/ice operations
* Swiss Military: Series1/2 hybrid with unique bumpers, canvas, and other details
* USA-spec: Larger &quot;bugeye&quot; headlights, other modifications to meet US requirements

==Australian assembly==
Approximately 800 Haflingers were assembled and sold in Australia from 1966.

<doc id="67425" wikidata="Q846674" url="?curid=67425" title="Battles of Saratoga">
<text>The Battles of Saratoga (September 19 and October 7, 1777) marked the climax of the Saratoga campaign, giving a decisive victory to the Americans over the British in the American Revolutionary War. British General John Burgoyne led an invasion army of 7,200–8,000 men southward from Canada in the Champlain Valley, hoping to meet a similar British force marching northward from New York City and another British force marching eastward from Lake Ontario; the goal was to take Albany, New York. British General William Howe never moved his forces north and Brigadier General Barry St. Leger turned back his forces meant to arrive from the west, leaving Burgoyne surrounded by American forces in upstate New York short of his goal. He fought two battles which took place 18 days apart on the same ground south of Saratoga, New York. He gained a victory in the first battle despite being outnumbered, but lost the second battle after the Americans returned with an even larger force.

Burgoyne found himself trapped by much larger American forces with no relief, so he retreated to Saratoga (now Schuylerville) and surrendered his entire army there on October 17. His surrender, says historian Edmund Morgan, &quot;was a great turning point of the war because it won for Americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory.&quot;

Burgoyne&#x27;s strategy to divide New England from the southern colonies had started well but slowed due to logistical problems. He won a small tactical victory over American General Horatio Gates and the Continental Army in the September 19 Battle of Freeman&#x27;s Farm at the cost of significant casualties. His gains were erased when he again attacked the Americans in the October 7 Battle of Bemis Heights and the Americans captured a portion of the British defenses. Burgoyne was therefore compelled to retreat, and his army was surrounded by the much larger American force at Saratoga, forcing him to surrender on October 17. News of Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender was instrumental in formally bringing France into the war as an American ally, although it had previously given supplies, ammunition, and guns, notably the de Valliere cannon which played an important role in Saratoga.

The battle on September 19 began when Burgoyne moved some of his troops in an attempt to flank the entrenched American position on Bemis Heights. American Major General Benedict Arnold anticipated the maneuver and placed significant forces in his way. Burgoyne did gain control of Freeman&#x27;s Farm, but it came at the cost of significant casualties. Skirmishing continued in the days following the battle, while Burgoyne waited in the hope that reinforcements would arrive from New York City. Patriot militia forces continued to arrive, meanwhile, swelling the size of the American army. Disputes within the American camp led Gates to strip Arnold of his command.

British General Sir Henry Clinton moved up from New York City and attempted to divert American attention by capturing Forts Clinton and Montgomery in the Hudson River highlands on October 6, and Kingston on October 13, but his efforts were too late to help Burgoyne. Burgoyne attacked Bemis Heights again on October 7 after it became apparent that he would not receive relieving aid in time. This battle culminated in heavy fighting marked by Arnold&#x27;s spirited rallying of the American troops. Burgoyne&#x27;s forces were thrown back to the positions that they held before the September 19 battle, and the Americans captured a portion of the entrenched British defenses.

==Background==
The American Revolutionary War was approaching the two-year point, and the British changed their plans. They decided to split the Thirteen Colonies and isolate New England from what they believed to be the more Loyalist middle and southern colonies. The British command devised a plan to divide the colonies with a three-way pincer movement in 1777. The western pincer under the command of Barry St. Leger was to progress from Ontario through western New York, following the Mohawk River, and the southern pincer was to progress up the Hudson River valley from New York City. The northern pincer was to proceed southward from Montreal, and the three forces were to meet in the vicinity of Albany, New York, severing New England from the other colonies.

===British situation===
British Lieutenant General John Burgoyne moved south from the province of Quebec in June 1777 to gain control of the upper Hudson River valley. His campaign had become bogged down in difficulties following a victory at Fort Ticonderoga. Elements of the army had reached the upper Hudson as early as the end of July, but logistical and supply difficulties delayed the main army at Fort Edward. One attempt to alleviate these difficulties failed when nearly 1,000 men were killed or captured at the August 16 Battle of Bennington. Furthermore, news reached Burgoyne on August 28 that St. Leger&#x27;s expedition down the Mohawk River valley had turned back after the failed Siege of Fort Stanwix.

General William Howe had taken his army from New York City by sea on a campaign to capture Philadelphia instead of moving north to meet Burgoyne. Most of Burgoyne&#x27;s Indian support had fled following the loss at Bennington, and his situation was becoming difficult. He needed to reach defensible winter quarters, requiring either retreat back to Ticonderoga or advance to Albany, and he decided to advance. He then deliberately cut communications to the north so that he would not need to maintain a chain of heavily fortified outposts between his position and Ticonderoga, and he decided to cross the Hudson River while he was in a relatively strong position. He ordered Baron Riedesel, who commanded the rear of the army, to abandon outposts from Skenesboro south, and then had the army cross the Hudson just north of Saratoga between September 13 and 15.
===American situation===
The Continental Army had been in a slow retreat since Burgoyne&#x27;s capture of Ticonderoga early in July, under the command of Major General Philip Schuyler, and was encamped south of Stillwater, New York. On August 19, Major General Horatio Gates assumed command from Schuyler, whose political fortunes had fallen over the loss of Ticonderoga and the ensuing retreat. Gates and Schuyler were from very different backgrounds and did not get along with each other. They had previously argued over command issues in the army&#x27;s Northern Department. The army was growing in size because of increased militia turnout following calls by state governors, the success at Bennington, and widespread outrage over the slaying of Jane McCrea, the fiancée of a Loyalist in Burgoyne&#x27;s army by Indians under Burgoyne&#x27;s command. This massive outpouring of militia continued as the battle progressed (and Burgoyne had no way of obtaining reinforcements). This sealed Burgoyne&#x27;s fate. By the end of the battle, Burgoyne&#x27;s army totaled 5,791, and the effective colonial force was about 12,000 men.

General George Washington&#x27;s strategic decisions also improved the situation for Gates&#x27; army. Washington was most concerned about the movements of General Howe. He was aware that Burgoyne was also moving, and he took some risks in July. He sent aid north in the form of Major General Benedict Arnold, his most aggressive field commander, and Major General Benjamin Lincoln, a Massachusetts man noted for his influence with the New England militia. He ordered 750 men from Israel Putnam&#x27;s forces defending the New York highlands to join Gates&#x27; army in August, before he was certain that Howe had indeed sailed south. He also sent some of the best forces from his own army: Colonel Daniel Morgan and the newly formed Provisional Rifle Corps, which comprised about 500 specially selected riflemen from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, chosen for their sharpshooting ability. This unit came to be known as Morgan&#x27;s Riflemen.

On September 7, Gates ordered his army to march north. A site was selected for its defensive potential that was known as Bemis Heights, just north of Stillwater and about south of Saratoga; the army spent about a week constructing defensive works designed by Polish engineer Tadeusz Kościuszko. The heights had a clear view of the area and commanded the only road to Albany, where it passed through a defile between the heights and the Hudson River. To the west of the heights lay more heavily forested bluffs that would present a significant challenge to any heavily equipped army.

==First Saratoga: Battle of Freeman&#x27;s Farm (September 19)==

===Prelude===
Moving very cautiously, since the departure of his Native American support had deprived him of reliable reports on the American position, Burgoyne advanced to the south after crossing the Hudson. On September 18, the vanguard of his army had finally reached a position just north of Saratoga, about from the American defensive line, and skirmishes occurred between American scouting parties and the leading elements of his army.

The American camp had become a bed of rising intrigue ever since Arnold&#x27;s return from Fort Stanwix. While he and Gates had previously been on reasonably good terms in spite of their prickly egos, Arnold managed to turn Gates against him by taking on officers friendly to Schuyler as staff, dragging him into the ongoing feud between the two. These conditions had not yet reached a boil on September 19, but the day&#x27;s events contributed to the situation. Gates had assigned the left wing of the defenses to Arnold, and assumed command himself of the right, which was nominally assigned to General Lincoln, whom Gates had detached in August with some troops to harass the British positions behind Burgoyne&#x27;s army.

Both Burgoyne and Arnold understood the importance of the American left, and the need to control the heights there. After the morning fog lifted around 10 am, Burgoyne ordered the army to advance in three columns. Baron Riedesel led the left column, consisting of the German troops and the 47th Foot, on the river road, bringing the main artillery and guarding supplies and the boats on the river. General James Inglis Hamilton commanded the center column, consisting of the 9th, 20th, 21st, and 62nd regiments, which would attack the heights, and General Simon Fraser led the right wing with the 24th Regiment and the light infantry and grenadier companies, to turn the American left flank by negotiating the heavily wooded high ground north and west of Bemis Heights.

Arnold also realized such a flanking maneuver was likely, and petitioned Gates for permission to move his forces from the heights to meet potential movements, where the American skill at woodlands combat would be at an advantage. Gates, whose preferred strategy was to sit and wait for the expected frontal assault, grudgingly permitted a reconnaissance in force consisting of Daniel Morgan&#x27;s men and Henry Dearborn&#x27;s light infantry. When Morgan&#x27;s men reached an open field northwest of Bemis Heights belonging to Loyalist John Freeman, they spotted British advance troops in the field. Fraser&#x27;s column was slightly delayed and had not yet reached the field, while Hamilton&#x27;s column had also made its way across a ravine and was approaching the field from the east through dense forest and difficult terrain. Riedesel&#x27;s force, while it was on the road, was delayed by obstacles thrown down by the Americans. The sound of gunfire to the west prompted Riedesel to send some of his artillery down a track in that direction. The troops Morgan&#x27;s men saw were an advance company from Hamilton&#x27;s column.

===Battle===
Morgan placed marksmen at strategic positions, who then picked off virtually every officer in the advance company. Morgan and his men then charged, unaware that they were headed directly for Burgoyne&#x27;s main army. While they succeeded in driving back the advance company, Fraser&#x27;s leading edge arrived just in time to attack Morgan&#x27;s left, scattering his men back into the woods. James Wilkinson, who had ridden forward to observe the fire, returned to the American camp for reinforcements. As the British company fell back toward the main column, the leading edge of that column opened fire, killing a number of their own men.

There was then a lull in the fighting around 1:00 pm as Hamilton&#x27;s men began to form up on the north side of the field, and American reinforcements began to arrive from the south. Learning that Morgan was in trouble, Gates ordered out two more regiments (1st and 3rd New Hampshire) to support him, with additional regiments (2nd New York, 4th New York, the 1st Canadian, and Connecticut militia) from the brigade of Enoch Poor to follow. Burgoyne arrayed Hamilton&#x27;s men with the 21st on the right, the 20th on the left, and the 62nd in the center, with the 9th held in reserve.

The battle then went through phases alternating between intense fighting and breaks in the action. Morgan&#x27;s men had regrouped in the woods, and picked off officers and artillerymen. They were so effective at reducing the latter that the Americans several times gained brief control of British field pieces, only to lose them in the next British charge. At one point it was believed that Burgoyne himself had been taken down by a sharpshooter; it was instead one of Burgoyne&#x27;s aides, riding a richly dressed horse, who was the victim. The center of the British line was very nearly broken at one point, and only the intervention of General Phillips, leading the 20th, made it possible for the 62nd to reform. In the memoir of Roger Lamb, a British soldier present at the battle, he wrote 

The final stroke of the battle belonged to the British. Around 3 pm, Riedesel sent a messenger to Burgoyne for instructions. He returned two hours later with orders to guard the baggage train, but also to send as many men as he could spare toward the American right flank. In a calculated risk, Riedesel left 500 men to guard the vital supply train and marched off toward the action with the rest of his column. Two of his companies advanced on the double and opened vicious fire on the American right, and Fraser&#x27;s force threatened to turn the American left flank. In response to the latter threat, Arnold requested more forces, and Gates allowed him to dispatch Ebenezer Learned&#x27;s brigade (2nd, 8th and 9th Massachusetts). (If Arnold had been on the field, these forces might have instead faced the larger danger posed by Riedesel&#x27;s force.) Fortunately for the American right, darkness set in, bringing an end to the battle. The Americans retreated back to their defenses, leaving the British on the field.

Burgoyne had gained the field of battle, but suffered nearly 600 casualties. Most of these were to Hamilton&#x27;s center column, where the 62nd was reduced to the size of a single company, and three quarters of the artillerymen were killed or wounded. American losses were nearly 300 killed and seriously wounded.

It has been widely recounted in histories of this battle that General Arnold was on the field, directing some of the action. However, John Luzader, a former park historian at the Saratoga National Historical Park, carefully documents the evolution of this story and believes it is without foundation in contemporary materials, and that Arnold remained at Gates&#x27; headquarters, receiving news and dispatching orders through messengers. Arnold biographer James Kirby Martin, however, disagrees with Luzader, arguing that Arnold played a more active role at Freeman&#x27;s Farm by directing patriot troops into position and possibly leading some charges before being ordered back to headquarters by Gates.

==Interlude==
Burgoyne&#x27;s council discussed whether to attack the next day, and a decision was reached to delay further action at least one day, to September 21. The army moved to consolidate the position closer to the American line while some men collected their dead. The attack on the 21st was called off when Burgoyne received a letter dated September 12 from Henry Clinton, who was commanding the British garrison in New York City. Clinton suggested that he could &quot;make a push at [Fort] Montgomery in about ten days.&quot; (Fort Montgomery was an American post on the Hudson River, in the New York Highlands south of West Point). If Clinton left New York on September 22, &quot;about ten days&quot; after he wrote the letter, he still could not hope to arrive in the vicinity of Saratoga before the end of the month. Burgoyne, running low on men and food, was still in a very difficult position, but he decided to wait in the hope that Clinton would arrive to save his army. Burgoyne wrote to Clinton on September 23, requesting some sort of assistance or diversion to draw Gates&#x27; army away. Clinton sailed from New York on October 3, and captured Forts Montgomery and Clinton on October 6. The furthest north any of his troops reached was Clermont, where they raided the estate of the prominent Patriot Livingston family on October 16.

Unknown to either side at Saratoga, General Lincoln and Colonel John Brown had staged an attack against the British position at Fort Ticonderoga. Lincoln had collected 2,000 men at Bennington by early September. Brown and a detachment of 500 men captured poorly defended positions between Ticonderoga and Lake George, and then spent several days ineffectually bombarding the fort. These men, and some of the prisoners they freed along the way, were back in the American camp by September 29.

In the American camp, the mutual resentment between Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold finally exploded into open hostility. Gates quickly reported the action of September 19 to the Congress and Governor George Clinton of New York, but he failed to mention Arnold at all. The field commanders and men universally credited Arnold for their success. Almost all the troops involved were from Arnold&#x27;s command and Arnold was the one directing the battle while Gates sat in his tent. Arnold protested, and the dispute escalated into a shouting match that ended with Gates relieving Arnold of his command and giving it to Benjamin Lincoln. Arnold asked for a transfer to Washington&#x27;s command, which Gates granted, but instead of leaving he remained in his tent. There is no documentary evidence for a commonly recounted anecdote that a petition signed by line officers convinced Arnold to stay in camp.

During this period there were almost daily clashes between pickets and patrols of the two armies. Morgan&#x27;s sharpshooters, familiar with the strategy and tactics of woodland warfare, constantly harassed British patrols on the western flank.

As September passed into October it became clear that Clinton was not coming to help Burgoyne, who put the army on short rations on October 3. The next day, Burgoyne called a war council in which several options were discussed, but no conclusive decisions were made. When the council resumed the next day, Riedesel proposed retreat, in which he was supported by Fraser. Burgoyne refused to consider it, insisting that retreat would be disgraceful. They finally agreed to conduct an assault on the American left flank with two thousand men, more than one-third of the army, on October 7. The army he was attacking, however, had grown in the interval. In addition to the return of Lincoln&#x27;s detachment, militiamen and supplies continued to pour into the American camp, including critical increases in ammunition, which had been severely depleted in the first battle. The army Burgoyne faced on October 7 was more than 12,000 men strong and was led by a man who knew how much trouble Burgoyne was in. Gates had received consistent intelligence from the stream of deserters leaving the British lines and had also intercepted Clinton&#x27;s response to Burgoyne&#x27;s plea for help.

==Second Saratoga: Battle of Bemis Heights (October 7)==
===British foray===
While Burgoyne&#x27;s troop strength was nominally higher, he likely had only about 5,000 effective, battle-ready troops on October 7, as losses from the earlier battles in the campaign and desertions following the September 19 battle had reduced his forces. General Riedesel advised that the army retreat. Burgoyne decided to reconnoiter the American left flank to see if an attack was possible. As an escort, the generals took Fraser&#x27;s Advanced Corps, with light troops and the 24th Foot on the right and the combined British grenadiers on the left, and a force drawn from all the German regiments in the army in the center. There were eight British cannon under Major Williams and two Hesse-Hanau cannon under Captain Pausch. Leaving their camp between 10 and 11 am, they advanced about three-quarters of a mile (1 km) to Barber&#x27;s wheat field on a rise above Mill Brook, where they stopped to observe the American position. While the field afforded some room for artillery to work, the flanks were dangerously close to the surrounding woods.

Gates, following the removal of Arnold from the field command, assumed command of the American left and gave the right to General Lincoln. When American scouts brought news of Burgoyne&#x27;s movement to Gates, he ordered Morgan&#x27;s riflemen out to the far left, with Poor&#x27;s men (1st, 2nd, and 3rd New Hampshire) on the left; the 2nd and 4th New York Regiments on the right, and Learned&#x27;s 1st New York, 1st Canadian, 2nd, 8th and 9th Massachusetts Regiments, plus militia companies, in the center. A force of 1,200 New York militia under Brigadier General Abraham Ten Broeck was held in reserve behind Learned&#x27;s line. In all, more than 8,000 Americans took the field that day, including about 1,400 men from Lincoln″s command that were deployed when the action became particularly fierce.

The opening fire came between 2 and 2:30 pm from the British grenadiers. Poor&#x27;s men held their fire, and the terrain made the British shooting largely ineffective. When Major Acland led the British grenadiers in a bayonet charge, the Americans finally began shooting at close range. Acland fell, shot in both legs, and many of the grenadiers also went down. Their column was a total rout, and Poor&#x27;s men advanced to take Acland and Williams prisoner and capture their artillery. On the American left, things were also not going well for the British. Morgan&#x27;s men swept aside the Canadians and Native Americans to engage Fraser&#x27;s regulars. Although slightly outnumbered, Morgan managed to break up several British attempts to move west. While General Fraser was mortally wounded in this phase of the battle, according to Luzader a frequently told story claiming it to be the work of Timothy Murphy, one of Morgan&#x27;s men, could be a 19th-century fabrication. The fall of Fraser and the arrival of Ten Broeck&#x27;s large militia brigade (which roughly equaled the entire British reconnaissance force in size), broke the British will, and they began a disorganized retreat toward their entrenchments. Burgoyne was also very nearly killed by one of Morgan&#x27;s marksmen; three shots hit his horse, hat, and waistcoat.

The first phase of the battle lasted about one hour and cost Burgoyne nearly 400 men, including the capture of most of the grenadiers&#x27; command, and six of the ten field pieces brought to the action.

=== American attack ===
At this point, the Americans were joined by an unexpected participant. General Arnold, who was &quot;betraying great agitation and wrath&quot; in the American camp, and may have been drinking, rode out to join the action. Gates immediately sent Major Armstrong after him with orders to return; Armstrong did not catch up with Arnold until the action was effectively over. (A letter, written by a witness to proceedings in the camp, suggests that Arnold did in fact have authorization from Gates to engage in this action.)

The defenses on the right side of the British camp were anchored by two redoubts. The outermost one was defended by about 300 men under the command of the Hessian Heinrich von Breymann, while the other was under the command of Lord Balcarres. A small contingent of Canadians occupied the ground between these two fortifications. Most of the retreating force headed for Balcarres&#x27; position, as Breymann&#x27;s was slightly north and further away from the early action.

Arnold led the American chase, and then led Poor&#x27;s men in an attack on the Balcarres redoubt. Balcarres had set up his defenses well, and the redoubt was held, in action so fierce that Burgoyne afterwards wrote, &quot;A more determined perseverance than they showed … is not in any officer&#x27;s experience&quot;. Seeing that the advance was checked, and that Learned was preparing to attack the Breymann redoubt, Arnold moved toward that action, recklessly riding between the lines and remarkably emerging unhurt. He led the charge of Learned&#x27;s men through the gap between the redoubts, which exposed the rear of Breymann&#x27;s position, where Morgan&#x27;s men had circled around from the far side. In furious battle, the redoubt was taken and Breymann was killed. Arnold&#x27;s horse was hit in one of the final volleys, and Arnold&#x27;s leg was broken by both shot and the falling horse. Major Armstrong finally caught up with Arnold to officially order him back to headquarters; he was carried back in a litter. Arnold wished that he was shot in the heart, knowing that if he died in the battle, he would have kept the fame as a heroic martyr.

The capture of Breymann&#x27;s redoubt exposed the British camp, but darkness was setting in. An attempt by some Germans to retake the redoubt ended in capture as darkness fell and an unreliable guide led them to the American line.

==Surrender==
Burgoyne had lost over 1,000 men in the two battles, leaving him outnumbered by roughly 3 to 1. American losses came to about 330 killed and wounded. Burgoyne had also lost several of his most effective leaders, his attempts to capture the American position had failed, and his forward line was now breached. After the second battle, Burgoyne lit fires at his remaining forward positions and withdrew under the cover of darkness. He withdrew his men 10–15 miles north, near present-day Schuylerville, New York. By the morning of October 8, he was back in the fortified positions he had held on September 16.

On October 13, with his army surrounded, Burgoyne held a council of war to propose terms of surrender. Riedesel suggested that they be paroled and allowed to march back to Canada without their weapons. Burgoyne felt that Gates would not even consider such terms, asking instead to be conveyed to Boston, where they would sail back to Europe. After several days of negotiations, the two sides signed the capitulation.

On October 17, Burgoyne surrendered his army to Gates. The British and German troops were accorded the traditional honors of war as they marched out to surrender. The troops formed the Convention Army, named after the convention that granted them safe passage back to Europe. However, the Continental Congress revoked the convention, and the Convention Army was kept in captivity until the end of the war.

==Aftermath==
Burgoyne&#x27;s failed campaign marked a major turning point in the war. General Burgoyne returned to England and was never given another commanding position in the British Army. The British learned that the Americans would fight bravely and effectively. One British officer said:

In recognition of his contribution to the battles at Saratoga, General Arnold had his seniority restored (he had lost it after being passed over for promotion earlier in 1777). However, Arnold&#x27;s leg wound kept him in bed five months. Later, while still unfit for field service but serving as military governor of Philadelphia, Arnold entered into treasonous correspondence with the British. He received command of the fort at West Point and plotted to hand it over to the British, only to flee into the British lines when the capture of his contact John André led to the exposure of the plot. Arnold went on to serve under William Phillips, the commander of Burgoyne&#x27;s right wing, in a 1781 expedition into Virginia.

Although he left the direction of the battle to subordinates, General Gates received a great deal of credit as the commanding general for the greatest American victory of the war to date. He may have conspired with others to replace George Washington as the commander-in-chief. Instead, he received the command of the main American army in the South. He led it to a disastrous defeat at the 1780 Battle of Camden, where he was at the forefront of a panicked retreat. Gates never commanded troops in the field thereafter.

In response to Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender, Congress declared December 18, 1777, as a national day &quot;for solemn Thanksgiving and praise&quot;; it was the nation&#x27;s first official observance of a holiday with that name.

===French aid===
Once news of Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender reached France, King Louis XVI decided to enter into negotiations with the Americans that resulted in a formal Franco-American alliance and French entry into the war. This moved the conflict onto a global stage. As a consequence, Britain was forced to divert resources used to fight the war in North America to theaters in the West Indies and Europe, and rely on what turned out to be the chimera of Loyalist support in its North American operations. Having been defeated by the British in the French and Indian War more than a decade earlier, France found an opportunity to undercut British power and ultimately of revenge by aiding the colonists throughout the Revolutionary War. Prior to the Battle of Saratoga, France did not fully aid the colonists. However, after the Battles of Saratoga were conclusively won by the colonists, France realized that the Americans had the hope of winning the war, and began fully aiding the colonists by sending soldiers, donations, loans, military arms, and supplies.

==Legacy==
The battlefield and the site of Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender have been preserved, and are now administered by the National Park Service as the Saratoga National Historical Park, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The park preserves a number of the buildings in the area and contains a variety of monuments. The Saratoga Monument obelisk has four niches, three of which hold statues of American commanders: Gates and Schuyler and of Colonel Daniel Morgan. The fourth niche, where Arnold&#x27;s statue would go, is empty. A more dramatic memorial to Arnold&#x27;s heroism, that does not name him, is the Boot Monument. Donated by Civil War General John Watts de Peyster, it shows a boot with spurs and the stars of a major general. It stands at the spot where Arnold was shot on October 7 charging Breymann&#x27;s redoubt and is dedicated to &quot;the most brilliant soldier of the Continental Army&quot;.

From 1972 to 1977, at the request of the National Park Service, archeologist Dean R. Snow conducted field investigations and excavations in and around the battlefield site, and recovered various artifacts and two human skeletons. As of mid-2023, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved 26 acres of the battlefield next to the national park.

Six Army National Guard units (101st Eng Bn, 102nd Inf, 125th QM Co, 181st Inf, 182nd Inf and 192nd MP Bn) are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Saratoga. There are now only thirty-two units in the U.S. Army with lineages that go back to the colonial era.

There are a number of ships named after the battles including USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; (1842), USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; (CV-3), and USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; (CV-60)

<text>The Glimmer Man is a 1996 American buddy-cop action comedy film directed by John Gray, written by Kevin Brodbin, and produced by Steven Seagal and Julius R. Nasso. Seagal and Keenen Ivory Wayans star as newly-partnered Los Angeles Police Department detectives Jack Cole and Jim Campbell, whose first case together – the pursuit of a serial killer who murders entire families – reveals connections to Cole&#x27;s mysterious past. Bob Gunton, Brian Cox, and Michelle Johnson also star.

Filming took place on location in and around Los Angeles. &quot;The Glimmer Man&quot; was released in the United States on October 4, 1996, by Warner Bros. It received mostly negative reviews from film critics and grossed $41.8 million against a budget of $45 million.

==Plot==
Jack Cole was once a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative known as &quot;the Glimmer Man&quot;, because he could move so quickly and quietly through the jungle that his victims would only see a glimmer before they died. Having retired from the CIA, Coleversed in Buddhism and unaccustomed to working with othershas become a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department.

Cole is partnered with Detective Jim Campbell, who has little patience for Cole&#x27;s New Age philosophies and &quot;outsider&quot; attitude. Cole and Campbell must set aside their differences when they are assigned to track down a serial killer known as &quot;the Family Man&quot;, named for his habit of killing entire households.

The Family Man&#x27;s latest victims turn out to be Cole&#x27;s ex-wife Ellen and her current husband Andrew Dunleavy. When Cole&#x27;s fingerprints are found on Ellen&#x27;s body, Campbell and he suspect that Smith - Jack&#x27;s former superior in the CIA - may be connected with the killings. Cole contacts Smith, who (unbeknownst to Campbell and him) has been working with local crime boss Frank Deverell.

Cole and Campbell receive a tip that leads them to Christopher Maynard who insists that the Family Man murders were actually committed by more than one killer. Only the slayings that occurred before Jack arrived in Los Angeles were Maynard&#x27;s work; more recently, a second party has been massacring households and blaming it on Maynard, whom Cole is forced to shoot in self-defense.

Seeking a lead on the &quot;other&quot; Family Man, Cole goes to the home of Sonya Roslov, Deverell&#x27;s Russian translator and a recent victim of the serial killer. Jack finds out that the Roslovs had tickets to Russia, paid for by Deverell&#x27;s company. The Family Man makes an unsuccessful attempt on the lives of both Cole and Campbell, blowing up the latter&#x27;s apartment. The Family Man is revealed to work for both Deverell and Smith, who have murder contracts out on both of the detectives and also on Johnny, Deverell&#x27;s own stepson.

Cole and Campbell question Johnny&#x27;s girlfriend, Millie, who tells them where to find Johnny. The detectives trick and kill a hitman sent by Johnny&#x27;s stepfather. Johnny informs Campbell and Cole that Donald Cunningham, Deverell&#x27;s private security chief, is the other Family Man, whose killings were confused with Maynard&#x27;s. Johnny also reveals Smith&#x27;s partnership with Deverell.

The detectives confront Smith, who reveals that Deverell has been smuggling chemical weapons into the USA from Russia and selling said arms to the Serbian underworld. Smith is arranging contacts for the deal, which is being cut by the Russian Liberation Fighters (the&quot; Organizatsiya&quot;). The sale has been scheduled to take place at a welfare hotel in downtown Los Angeles.

When Cole and Campbell storm the hotel to disrupt the weapons deal, Cunningham kills Deverell (because Deverell set up Cunningham for the LAPD, to clear himself of the arms-running charges) and wounds Campbell. Cole fights Cunningham, finally throwing him through a window to be impaled on a wrought iron fence.

Campbell jokes that Cole has brought him nothing but bad luck ever since they became partners. Cole says he will keep that in mind, as Campbell is driven off to the hospital.

==Production==
===Development===
In the original screenplay, which was 114 pages long, Cole was called Calhoun, Campbell was named Leary, and Donald Cunningham was called Abraham.

Originally envisioned as a much larger action picture, the film was similar in scope to &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot; (1991), which starred Wayans&#x27; brother Damon Wayans. Several action scenes were removed to cut down the budget, including the bombing of a boat owned by Campbell (who lived on a houseboat instead of an apartment), an encounter between Cole and a SWAT team, who have raided his house, and the final confrontation/gunfight at the LA museum.

Roland Joffé was originally considered to direct the picture.

Brian Cox&#x27;s character Mr. Smith was originally intended for Steven Seagal&#x27;s &quot;Under Siege&quot; co-star Tommy Lee Jones, and he was attached to the film before leaving shortly before filming began. Cox replaced him on very short notice.

===Filming===
The film was shot on location in and around Los Angeles, California. After the filming was completed, Warner Bros. conducted additional editing to make it faster and appear more like previous Steven Seagal movies. Cut scenes included several comedic and dramatic exchanges between Campbell and Cole, as well as several scenes of Cole&#x27;s wife Jessica, played by Michelle Johnson.

According to Stephen Tobolowsky, Seagal wanted to change the scene in which Cole kills Maynard. Due to his spiritual beliefs, Seagal did not want to kill villains in his movies anymore. Tobolowsky convinced Seagal that Maynard was a deeply unhappy person and killing him would allow for reincarnation and redemption. Seagal agreed and the scene was filmed as written. Months later, however, Seagal wanted to change the scene to show that Maynard survived the shooting. Tobolowsky was brought in to overdub lines to indicate that Maynard was still alive, though this was not used in the final cut.

Seagal wrote two original songs for the film, &quot;Bulletproof&quot; and &quot;Snake&quot;, performed by the Jeff Healey Band and Taj Mahal, respectively. Guitarist Trevor Rabin, formerly of Yes, composed the score, his first as a film music composer.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film debuted at number two at the box office behind &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, but despite this, the film was an overall box-office flop, grossing only $20,351,264 in the United States and Canada and $41.8 million worldwide, against an estimated production budget of $45 million.

===Critical response===
The film received mostly negative reviews from film critics. Lawrence Van Gelder, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, did not like the film. He wrote, Short on suspense, routine in its action and monotonous in its performances, this movie opened yesterday without [the] benefit of press screenings, usually, a sign that the distributors have detected cinematic &quot;rigor mortis&quot; before audiences formally withdraw such life-support systems as tickets, popcorn, and the glucose drip of spilled Coke.

Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a negative review, commenting, &quot;For a rock&#x27;em, sock&#x27;em action thriller, &quot;The Glimmer Man&quot; is a hopelessly slow-moving, slow-witted shaggy-dog tale that delivers the jolts, but lacks the juice necessary for high-voltage entertainment.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 11% based on 27 reviews with the consensus: &quot;A grimy, humorless glimpse of Steven Seagal&#x27;s direct-to-video future, &quot;The Glimmer Man&quot; fails to shine.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 33% based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

<text>Titan was a family of United States expendable rockets used between 1959 and 2005. The Titan I and Titan II were part of the US Air Force&#x27;s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fleet until 1987. The space launch vehicle versions contributed the majority of the 368 Titan launches, including all the Project Gemini crewed flights of the mid-1960s. Titan vehicles were also used to lift US military payloads as well as civilian agency reconnaissance satellites and to send interplanetary scientific probes throughout the Solar System.

==Titan I missile==
The HGM-25A Titan I, built by the Martin Company, was the first version of the Titan family of rockets. It began as a backup ICBM project in case the SM-65 Atlas was delayed. It was a two-stage rocket operational from early 1962 to mid-1965 whose LR-87 booster engine was powered by RP-1 (kerosene) and liquid oxygen (LOX). The ground guidance for the Titan was the UNIVAC ATHENA computer, designed by Seymour Cray, based in a hardened underground bunker. Using radar data, it made course corrections during the burn phase.

Unlike decommissioned Thor, Atlas, and Titan II missiles, the Titan I inventory was scrapped and never reused for space launches or RV tests, as all support infrastructure for the missile had been converted to the Titan II/III family by 1965.

==Titan II==
===Titan II missile===

Most of the Titan rockets were the Titan II ICBM and their civilian derivatives for NASA. The Titan II used the LR-87-5 engine, a modified version of the LR-87, that used a hypergolic propellant combination of nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) for its oxidizer and Aerozine 50 (a 50/50 mix of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) instead of the liquid oxygen and RP-1 propellant of the Titan I.

The first Titan II guidance system was built by AC Spark Plug. It used an inertial measurement unit made by AC Spark Plug derived from original designs from the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT. The missile guidance computer (MGC) was the IBM ASC-15. When spares for this system became hard to obtain, it was replaced by a more modern guidance system, the Delco Electronics Universal Space Guidance System (USGS). The USGS used a Carousel IV IMU and a Magic 352 computer. The USGS was already in use on the Titan III space launcher when work began in March 1978 to replace the Titan II guidance system. The main reason was to reduce the cost of maintenance by $72 million per year; the conversions were completed in 1981.

====Hypergolic propellants====

Liquid oxygen is dangerous to use in an enclosed space, such as a missile silo, and cannot be stored for long periods in the booster oxidizer tank. Several Atlas and Titan I rockets exploded and destroyed their silos, although without loss of life. The Martin Company was able to improve the design with the Titan II. The RP-1/LOX combination was replaced by a room-temperature fuel whose oxidizer did not require cryogenic storage. The same first-stage rocket engine was used with some modifications. The diameter of the second stage was increased to match the first stage. The Titan II&#x27;s hypergolic fuel and oxidizer ignited on contact, but they were highly toxic and corrosive liquids. The fuel was Aerozine 50, a 50/50 mix of hydrazine and UDMH, and the oxidizer was NTO.

====Accidents at silos====
There were several accidents in Titan II silos resulting in loss of life and/or serious injuries.

In August 1965, 53 construction workers were killed in fire in a missile silo northwest of Searcy, Arkansas. The fire started when hydraulic fluid used in the Titan II was ignited by a welding torch.

The liquid fuel missiles were prone to developing leaks of their toxic propellants. At a silo outside Rock, Kansas, an oxidizer transfer line carrying NTO ruptured on August 24, 1978. An ensuing orange vapor cloud forced 200 rural residents to evacuate the area. A staff sergeant of the maintenance crew was killed while attempting a rescue and a total of twenty were hospitalized.

Another site at Potwin, Kansas leaked NTO oxidizer in April 1980 with no fatalities, and was later closed.

In September 1980, at Titan II silo 374-7 near Damascus, Arkansas, a technician dropped an socket that fell , bounced off a thrust mount, and broke the skin of the missile&#x27;s first stage, over eight hours prior to an eventual explosion. The puncture occurred about 6:30 p.m. and when a leak was detected shortly after, the silo was flooded with water and civilian authorities were advised to evacuate the area. As the problem was being attended to at around 3 a.m., leaking rocket fuel ignited and blew the nuclear warhead out of the silo. It landed harmlessly several hundred feet away. There was one fatality and 21 were injured, all from the emergency response team from Little Rock AFB. The explosion blew the 740-ton launch tube cover into the air and left a crater in diameter.
====Missile retirement====
The 54 Titan IIs in Arizona, Arkansas, and Kansas were replaced by 50 MX &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; solid-fuel rocket missiles in the mid-1980s; the last Titan II silo was deactivated in May 1987. The 54 Titan IIs had been fielded along with a thousand Minuteman missiles from the mid-1960s through the mid-1980s.

A number of Titan I and Titan II missiles have been distributed as museum displays across the United States.

===Titan II launch vehicle===

The most famous use of the civilian Titan II was in the NASA Gemini program of crewed space capsules in the mid-1960s. Twelve Titan II GLVs were used to launch two U.S. uncrewed Gemini test launches and ten crewed capsules with two-person crews. All of the launches were successful.

===Titan 23G===

Starting in the late 1980s, some of the deactivated Titan IIs were converted into space launch vehicles to be used for launching U.S. Government payloads. 
Titan 23G rockets consisted of two stages burning liquid propellant. The first stage was powered by one Aerojet LR87 engine with two combustion chambers and nozzles, and the second stage was propelled by an LR91. On some flights, the spacecraft included a kick motor, usually the Star-37XFP-ISS; however, the Star-37S was also used.

Thirteen were launched from Space Launch Complex 4W (SLC-4W) at Vandenberg Air Force Base starting in 1988. The final such vehicle launched a Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) weather satellite on 18 October 2003.

==Titan III==

The Titan III was a modified Titan II with optional solid rocket boosters. It was developed on behalf of the United States Air Force (USAF) as a heavy-lift satellite launcher to be used mainly to launch American military payloads and civilian intelligence agency satellites such as the Vela Hotel nuclear-test-ban monitoring satellites, observation and reconnaissance satellites (for intelligence-gathering), and various series of defense communications satellites. As USAF project, Titan III was more formally known as Program 624A (SSLS), Standard Space Launch System, Standardized Space Launch System, Standardized Space Launching System or Standard Space Launching System (all abbreviated SSLS).

The Titan III core was similar to the Titan II, but had a few differences. These included:

*Thicker tank walls and ablative skirts to support the added weight of upper stages
*Radio ground guidance in place of the inertial guidance on ICBM Titan IIs
*Guidance package placed on the upper stages (if present)
*Removal of retrorockets and other unnecessary ICBM hardware
*Slightly larger propellant tanks in the second stage for longer burn time; since they expanded into some unused space in the avionics truss, the actual length of the stage remained unchanged.

The Titan III family used the same basic LR-87 engines as Titan II (with performance enhancements over the years), however SRB-equipped variants had a heat shield over them as protection from the SRB exhaust and the engines were modified for air-starting.

===Avionics===
The first guidance system for the Titan III used the AC Spark Plug company IMU (inertial measurement unit) and an IBM ASC-15 guidance computer from the Titan II. For the Titan III, the ASC-15 drum memory of the computer was lengthened to add 20 more usable tracks, which increased its memory capacity by 35%.

The more-advanced Titan IIIC used a Delco Carousel VB IMU and MAGIC 352 Missile Guidance Computer (MGC).

===Titan IIIA===

The Titan IIIA was a prototype rocket booster and consisted of a standard Titan II rocket with a Transtage upper stage.

===Titan IIIB===

The Titan IIIB with its different versions (23B, 24B, 33B, and 34B) had the Titan III core booster with an Agena D upper stage. This combination was used to launch the KH-8 GAMBIT series of intelligence-gathering satellites. They were all launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, due south over the Pacific into polar orbits. Their maximum payload mass was about 7,500 lb (3,000 kg).

===Titan IIIC===

The powerful Titan IIIC used a Titan III core rocket with two large strap-on solid-fuel boosters to increase its launch thrust and maximum payload mass. The solid-fuel boosters that were developed for the Titan IIIC represented a significant engineering advance over previous solid-fueled rockets, due to their large size and thrust, and their advanced thrust-vector control systems.

===Titan IIID===

The Titan IIID was the Vandenberg Air Force Base version of the Titan IIIC, without a Transtage, that was used to place members of the Key Hole series of reconnaissance satellites into polar low Earth orbits.

===Titan IIIE===

The Titan IIIE, with a high-specific-impulse Centaur upper stage, was used to launch several scientific spacecraft, including both of NASA&#x27;s two Voyager space probes to Jupiter, Saturn and beyond, and both of the two Viking missions to place two orbiters around Mars and two instrumented landers on its surface.

===Titan 34D===

The Titan 34D featured Stage 1 and Stage 2 stretched with more powerful UA1206 solid motors. A variety of upper stages were available, including the Inertial Upper Stage, the Transfer Orbit Stage, and the Transtage. The Titan 34D made its maiden flight in the year of 1982 on the 30th of October with two DSCS defense communications satellites for the United States Department of Defense (DOD).

===Commercial Titan III===

Derived from the Titan 34D and originally proposed as a medium-lift expendable launch system for the US Air Force, who selected the Delta II instead. Development was continued as a commercial launch system, and the first rocket flew in 1990. The Commercial Titan III differed from the Titan 34D in that it had a stretched second stage, and a larger payload fairing to accommodate dual satellite payloads.

===Titan IIIM===

The Titan IIIM was intended to launch the Manned Orbiting Laboratory and other payloads. Development was cancelled in 1969. The projected UA1207 solid booster rockets were eventually used on the Titan IV.

==Titan IV==

The Titan IV was an extended length Titan III with solid rocket boosters on its sides. The Titan IV could be launched with a Centaur upper stage, the USAF Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), or no upper stage at all. This rocket was used almost exclusively to launch US military or Central Intelligence Agency payloads. However, it was also used for a purely scientific purpose to launch the NASA–ESA Cassini / Huygens space probe to Saturn in 1997. The primary intelligence agency that needed the Titan IV&#x27;s launch capabilities was the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).

When it was being produced, the Titan IV was the most powerful uncrewed rocket available to the United States, with proportionally high manufacturing and operations expenses. By the time the Titan IV became operational, the requirements of the Department of Defense and the NRO for launching satellites had tapered off due to improvements in the longevity of reconnaissance satellites and the declining demand for reconnaissance that followed the internal disintegration of the Soviet Union. As a result of these events and improvements in technology, the unit cost of a Titan IV launch was very high. Additional expenses were generated by the ground operations and facilities for the Titan IV at Vandenberg Air Force Base for launching satellites into polar orbits. Titan IVs were also launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, a location often used for launch into non-polar orbits.

==Titan V concept==

The Titan V was a proposed development of the Titan IV, that saw several designs being suggested. One Titan V proposal was for an enlarged Titan IV, capable of lifting up to of payload. Another used a cryogenic first stage with LOX/LH2 propellants; however the Atlas V EELV was selected for production instead.

==Launch vehicle retirement==
Most of the decommissioned Titan II ICBMs were refurbished and used for Air Force space launch vehicles, with a perfect launch success record.

For orbital launches, there were strong advantages to using higher-performance liquid hydrogen or RP-1 fueled vehicles with liquid oxygen; the high cost of using hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, along with the special care that was needed due to their toxicity, were a further consideration. Lockheed Martin decided to extend its Atlas family of rockets instead of its more expensive Titans, along with participating in joint-ventures to sell launches on the Russian Proton rocket and the new Boeing-built Delta IV class of medium and heavy-lift launch vehicles. The Titan IVB was the last Titan rocket to remain in service, making its penultimate launch from Cape Canaveral on 30 April 2005, followed by its final launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base on 19 October 2005, carrying the USA-186 optical imaging satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office.

<text>Nymphaeaceae () is a family of flowering plants, commonly called water lilies. They live as rhizomatous aquatic herbs in temperate and tropical climates around the world. The family contains five genera with about 70 known species. Water lilies are rooted in soil in bodies of water, with leaves and flowers floating on or rising from the surface. Leaves are oval and heart-shaped in &quot;Barclaya&quot;. Leaves are round, with a radial notch in &quot;Nymphaea&quot; and &quot;Nuphar&quot;, but fully circular in &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Euryale&quot;.

Water lilies are a well-studied family of plants because their large flowers with multiple unspecialized parts were initially considered to represent the floral pattern of the earliest flowering plants. Later genetic studies confirmed their evolutionary position as basal angiosperms. Analyses of floral morphology and molecular characteristics and comparisons with a sister taxon, the family Cabombaceae, indicate, however, that the flowers of extant water lilies with the most floral parts are more derived than the genera with fewer floral parts. Genera with more floral parts, &quot;Nuphar&quot;, &quot;Nymphaea&quot;, &quot;Victoria&quot;, have a beetle pollination syndrome, while genera with fewer parts are pollinated by flies or bees, or are self- or wind-pollinated. Thus, the large number of relatively unspecialized floral organs in the Nymphaeaceae is not an ancestral condition for the clade.

==Description==
=== Vegetative characteristics ===
The Nymphaeaceae are annual or perennial, aquatic, rhizomatous herbs. The family is further characterized by scattered vascular bundles in the stems, and frequent presence of latex, usually with distinct, stellate-branched sclereids projecting into the air canals. Hairs are simple, usually producing mucilage (slime).

Leaves are alternate and spiral, opposite or occasionally whorled, simple, peltate or nearly so, entire to toothed or dissected, short to long petiolate, with blade submerged, floating or emergent, with palmate to pinnate venation. Stipules are either present or absent.

=== Generative characteristics ===
Flowers are solitary, bisexual, radial, with a long pedicel and usually floating or raised above the surface of the water, with girdling vascular bundles in receptacle. Some species are protogynous and primarily cross-pollinated, but because male and female stages overlap during the second day of flowering, and because it is self-compatible, self-fertilization is possible. Female and male parts of the flower are usually active at different times, to facilitate cross-pollination, although this is just one of several reproductive strategies used by these plants.

There are 4–12 sepals, which are distinct to connate, imbricate, and often petallike. Petals lacking or 8 to numerous, inconspicuous to showy, often intergrading with stamens. Stamens are 3 to numerous, the innermost sometimes represented by staminodes. Filaments are distinct, free or adnate to petaloid staminodes, slender and well differentiated from anthers to laminar and poorly differentiated from anthers; pollen grains usually monosulcate or lacking apertures. Carpels are 3 to numerous, distinct or connate.

The fruit is an aggregate of nuts, a berry, or an irregularly dehiscent fleshy spongy capsule. Seeds are often arillate, more or less lacking endosperm.

==Taxonomy==
Nymphaeaceae has been investigated systematically for decades because botanists considered their floral morphology to represent one of the earliest groups of angiosperms. Modern genetic analyses by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group researchers has confirmed its basal position among flowering plants. In addition, the Nymphaeaceae are more genetically diverse and geographically dispersed than other basal angiosperms. Nymphaeaceae is placed in the order Nymphaeales, which is the second diverging group of angiosperms after &quot;Amborella&quot; in the most widely accepted flowering plant classification system, APG IV system.

Nymphaeaceae is a small family of three to six genera: &quot;Barclaya&quot;, &quot;Euryale&quot;, &quot;Nuphar&quot;, &quot;Nymphaea&quot;, &quot;Ondinea&quot;, and &quot;Victoria&quot;. The genus &quot;Barclaya&quot; is sometimes given rank as its own family, Barclayaceae, on the basis of an extended perianth tube (combined sepals and petals) arising from the top of the ovary and by stamens that are joined in the base. However, molecular phylogenetic work includes it in Nymphaeaceae. The genus &quot;Ondinea&quot; has recently been shown to be a morphologically aberrant species of &quot;Nymphaea&quot;, and is now included in this genus. The genera &quot;Euryale&quot;, of far east Asia, and &quot;Victoria&quot;, from South America, are closely related despite their geographic distance, but their relationship toward &quot;Nymphaea&quot; need further studies.

The sacred lotus was once thought to be a water lily, but is now recognized to be a highly modified eudicot in its own family Nelumbonaceae of the order Proteales.

=== Fossils ===
Several fossil species are known, including Cretaceous representatives of &quot;Nymphaea&quot;, as well as fossil genera such as &quot;Jaguariba&quot; from the Cretaceous of Brazil, &quot;Allenbya&quot; from the Ypresian of British Columbia, &quot;Notonuphar&quot; from the Eocene of Antarctica, &quot;Nuphaea&quot; from the Eocene of Germany, &quot;Susiea&quot; from the Late Paleocene Almont Flora of North Dakota, USA, and &quot;Barclayopsis&quot; from the Maastrichtian of Eisleben, Germany.

==Invasiveness==
The beautiful nature of water lilies has led to their widespread use as ornamental plants. The Mexican waterlily, native to the Gulf Coast of North America, is planted throughout the continent. It has escaped from cultivation and become invasive in some areas, such as California&#x27;s San Joaquin Valley. It can infest slow-moving bodies of water and is difficult to eradicate. Populations can be controlled by cutting top growth. Herbicides can also be used to control populations using glyphosate and fluridone.

==Culture==
The water lily is the national flower of Iran, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The Emblem of Bangladesh contains a lily floating on water. It is also the birth flower for the month of July.

The Nymphaeaceae, which is also called (Nilufar Abi in Persian), can be seen in many reliefs of the Achaemenid period (552 BC) such as the statue of Anahita in the Persepolis. Lotus flower was included in Kaveh the blacksmith&#x27;s Derafsh and later as the flag of the Sasanian Empire Derafsh Kaviani. Today, it is known as the symbol of Iranians Solar Hijri Calendar.

Lily pads, also known as &quot;Seeblätter&quot;, are a charge in Northern European heraldry, often coloured red (gules), and appear on the flag of Friesland and the coat of arms of Denmark (in the latter case often replaced by red hearts).

The water lily has a special place in Sangam literature and Tamil poetics, where it is considered symbolic of the grief of separation; it is considered to evoke imagery of the sunset, the seashore, and the shark.

===Heraldry===
=== In visual arts ===
Water lilies were depicted by the French artist Claude Monet (1840–1926) in a series of paintings.

=== The Maya ===
The main job of the Maya rulers during pre-Columbian Mesoamerica was to obtain clean and drinkable water for their citizens during both the wet and dry seasons. Their success in accomplishing this is what allowed them to grow their polity by attracting dry-season laborers. They did this by constructing water systems such as reservoirs, wetland reclamation, and dams and channels to capture and store rainwater. With their knowledge of the wetland biosphere, they transformed artificial reservoirs into wetland biospheres. One way that they tested whether the water systems were working properly was if the Nymphaeaceae were thriving. Water lilies became a visual sign of water cleanliness, so the Maya elite began to associate themselves with the flowers. 

The Maya began to use water lily iconography depicted on stelae, monumental architecture, murals, and in hieroglyphic writing. Even in Maya settlements like Palenque, where the main water supplies were springs and flowing streams (places where water lilies cannot grow), the flowers were prevalent in their iconographic records. Aristocrats and religious figures wore masks and/or headdresses during celebratory events that had water lilies and/or water lily symbols to appear like gods. There is also evidence that water lilies were used as cultural entheogenic. Some interpretations of ritual scenes drawn out by the Maya have been blood being extracted from perforated body parts. However, more close examinations show that this is instead a liquid flowing directly from water lily flowers that were on the heads of certain gods. It is likely that the Maya ingested these plants to create a non-ordinary state of consciousness, which makes sense because there is a class of opiate alkaloids in Nymphaeaceae. Overall, these examples show just how important this specific form of water symbolism was throughout the Maya region.

<doc id="67431" wikidata="Q1418758" url="?curid=67431" title="Fire Down Below (1997 film)">
<text>Fire Down Below is a 1997 American action film starring Steven Seagal and directed by Félix Enríquez Alcalá in his directorial debut. The film also includes cameos by country music performers Randy Travis, Mark Collie, Ed Bruce, Marty Stuart and Travis Tritt, and country-rocker and the Band member Levon Helm, as well as Kris Kristofferson in a supporting role. Steven Seagal plays Jack Taggert, an EPA agent who investigates a Kentucky mine and helps locals stand up for their rights. The film was released in the United States on September 5, 1997.

==Plot==
In the peaceful Appalachian hills of eastern Kentucky, toxins are being dumped into abandoned mines, causing environmental havoc, but the locals, mindful of their jobs and the power of the mine owners, can do nothing. EPA CID agent Jack Taggert is sent to investigate, after a fellow agent, revealed to be Jack&#x27;s friend and partner, Frank Elkins, is found dead, probably not by accident. The EPA has received an anonymous letter from Jackson, Kentucky, and Taggert goes undercover to continue his colleague&#x27;s investigations.

It is discovered that Hanner Coal Company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr., is being paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft, so Jack is assigned to go to the small town of Jackson, where his cover is that of assistant and volunteer carpenter to a local church. He stays in a room in the church&#x27;s basement and begins his cover work by repairing the roof at a house where one of the children is sick because of the pollution. He attempts to question the family, but they do not have much to say. He has little better results elsewhere; even the man who tipped off the EPA is decidedly taciturn. While testing the water, Taggert wanders into a local marijuana field and is accosted by the growers. After disarming them, he tells them that he has no interest in arresting them.

The men responsible for Agent Elkins&#x27; death soon notice Taggert&#x27;s presence. As a newcomer to the small local community, he is threatened by Hanner&#x27;s son Orin Jr. (Brad Hunt), the incompetent local tool of the company; the corrupt local Sheriff Lloyd Foley; and several thugs that work for them. The thugs in question start by leaving two rattlesnakes in his dwelling; Taggert responds by capturing the snakes alive and leaving them in the pickup that the thugs were driving, causing them to crash. Soon after, five of them attack him while he is buying supplies, and receive a severe beating as a result. Orin then orders one of his truck drivers to arrange an &quot;accident&quot; by running him off the road, but Taggert escapes alive while the driver is killed after falling off an open-pit mine cliff.

While these conflicts occur, Taggert strikes up a relationship with Sarah Kellogg, a young woman who lives in the town. She is regarded as an outcast because of her father&#x27;s murder, a crime of which she was accused but not convicted. Eventually, she agrees to testify against Orin and his people, much to the anger of her estranged brother Earl, who actually committed the murder, after their father found out about his sexual abuse against her. Earl is revealed to be working as one of Hanner&#x27;s thugs, and sets the church on fire, in the process killing the preacher who was helping Taggert. He then attempts to collapse the mine with Taggert inside it. Taggert escapes, while several mercenaries are killed, including Earl.

With evidence and a witness, Taggert calls the FBI to take Sarah into protective custody. However, they are revealed to be corrupt, and a firefight ensues. Taggert kills one agent, then sends the second back to Orin with a message that he will be coming for him next. However, when Orin is arrested and charged, he gets off with a slap on the wrist for the environmental violations. Taggert goes back into the town and fights his way past the last of Orin Jr&#x27;s thugs, then demands the truth from him. Orin agrees to turn the state&#x27;s evidence, implicating his father on racketeering, conspiracy, and murder charges. Taggert goes to a casino to arrest Orin Sr. Upon hearing about the reception awaiting him in federal prison, Orin produces a gun and resists, but Taggert shoots him in the shoulder and he is taken into custody. Taggert then returns to Jackson, where he is reunited with Sarah.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was shot on location in and around Kentucky; parts of the &quot;truck chase scene&quot; were shot at Natural Bridge State Resort Park. Some of the opening scenes were filmed at Cumberland Falls State Resort Park. The cave scenes were filmed in the Great Saltpetre Cave. This was the third, and final time that Kane Hodder worked with Seagal as a stuntman.

Seagal liked the film in part because it was &quot;kind of an environmental movie.&quot; He also enjoyed working with Helgenberger. &quot;While I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s a physical, spectacular, drop dead gorgeous woman, at the same time she&#x27;s a spectacular actress,&quot; said Seagal. &quot;Her performance was wonderful.&quot;

<doc id="67433" wikidata="Q4356154" url="?curid=67433" title="Prince of Central Park">
<text>Prince of Central Park is a 2000 movie. The cast included Kathleen Turner, Danny Aiello, Harvey Keitel, and Cathy Moriarty. It was written and directed by John Leekley, and produced by Julius R. Nasso, Steven Seagal, and John P. Gulino. The film is a remake of the 1977 TV movie &quot;The Prince of Central Park&quot;, starring Ruth Gordon and T.J. Hargrave; both films were based on the novel &quot;The Prince of Central Park&quot; by Evan Rhodes.

==Plot==
12-year-old J.J. Somerled (Frankie Nasso) runs away because his mother died and he has been placed in the care of an abusive foster mother. He takes his electronic keyboard, and lives in Central Park in New York City. He learns a lot, and meets a lot of people there including a person called &quot;The Guardian&quot; (Harvey Keitel).

==Cast==
==Adaptation==
Rhodes also adapted his own novel for Broadway in 1989, but the production, starring Jo Anne Worley, was so poorly received it closed after four performances.
The production was directed and choreographed by Tony Tanner. The sets and costumes were designed by Michael Bottari and Ronald Case, who received many good reviews for their turntable set design. The Lighting Design was by Norman Coates.
There was a production prior to the Broadway opening in Miami Beach that was directed by Bob Bogdanoff and starred Nannette Fabray. Many have thought that if Nannette Fabray stayed with the show, that the musical would have lasted longer.
The Broadway production played at the Belasco Theater. In addition to JoAnne Worley, it starred a young Richard H. Blake, who would go on to become a familiar face on Broadway in such shows as The Wedding Singer, Saturday Night Fever, and Legally Blonde: The Musical. Anthony Galde (of Starlight Express-Broadway and 1st U.S. Tour, Film: Just One of the Guys) played the leader of the street gang.

==Production==
Steven Seagal was initially scheduled to appear in the film before he withdrew on the advice of his Buddhist spiritual adviser. Harvey Keitel was subsequently cast in the role.

<doc id="67435" wikidata="Q212079" url="?curid=67435" title="Second Triumvirate">
<text>The Second Triumvirate was an extraordinary commission and magistracy created at the end of the Roman republic for Mark Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian to give them practically absolute power. It was formally constituted by law on 27 November 43 BC with a term of five years; it was renewed in 37 BC for another five years before expiring in 32 BC. Constituted by the &quot;lex Titia&quot;, the triumvirs were given broad powers to make or repeal legislation, issue judicial punishments without due process or right of appeal, and appoint all other magistrates. The triumvirs also split the Roman world into three sets of provinces.

The triumvirate, formed in the aftermath of a conflict between Antony and the senate, emerged as a force to reassert Caesarian control over the western provinces and wage war on the &quot;liberatores&quot; led by the men who assassinated Julius Caesar. After proscriptions, purging the senatorial and equestrian orders, and a brutal civil war, the &quot;liberatores&quot; were defeated at the Battle of Philippi. After Philippi, Antony and Octavian took the east and west, respectively, with Lepidus confined to Africa. The last remaining opposition to the Triumvirs came from Sextus Pompey, a son of Pompey the Great, who controlled Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia.

Octavian and Antony were pushed to cooperation, in part by their soldiers, and the triumvirs had their legal arrangement renewed for another five years in 37 BC. Eventually, after Antony&#x27;s defeat in Parthia and Octavian&#x27;s victory over Sextus Pompey, Octavian forced Lepidus from the triumvirate in 36 BC. Relations between the two remaining triumvirs broke down in the late 30s BC before they fought a final war, from which Octavian emerged the victor.

== Name ==

The name &quot;Second Triumvirate&quot; is a modern misnomer derived from the branding of the political alliance between Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar (created ) as the &quot;First&quot; Triumvirate. This nomenclature was unknown during and before the Renaissance and was first attested in the late 17th century, coming into widespread use only in the following century. Recent books have started to avoid the traditional nomenclature of &quot;First&quot; and &quot;Second&quot; Triumvirates. The &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot;, for example, warns &quot;&#x27;First&#x27; and &#x27;Second Triumvirate&#x27; are modern and misleading terms&quot;.

== Triumviral period ==
Following the assassination of Julius Caesar on 15 March 44 BC, there was initially a settlement reached between the perpetrators, who styled themselves &quot;liberatores&quot;, and remaining Caesarian supporters. This settlement included an amnesty for the tyrannicides, confirmation of Caesar&#x27;s official actions, and abolition of the dictatorship. By late spring 44 BC, the provinces assigned by Caesar before his death – many to his later killers – were largely confirmed.

Mark Antony was one of the consuls for 44 BC and on 2 June 44 BC, was able to push through illegal legislation assigning to himself the provinces of Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul, displacing their existing governors. These governorships secured for Antony a political future where he would be able to intimidate the senate and Italy from across the river Rubicon. Antony also persuaded the senate to disarm Marcus Brutus and Cassius (the two leading tyrannicides) giving them grain supply assignments; both men viewed these assignments as insults, later compounded by their assignment to minor provinces after their praetorships.

Relations between Antony and Caesar&#x27;s legal heir, Octavian, also started to break down: Octavian was successful in attracting some of Caesar&#x27;s veterans from Antony&#x27;s camp, undercutting Antony&#x27;s military support. Antony also sought later in the year to isolate Cicero politically, as the eloquent ex-consul was prestigious and on friendly terms with large portions of the aristocracy. Octavian, starting a bidding war for extreme Caesarians, broke with Antony and formed for himself a private army. In December 44 BC, Cicero induced the senate to honour Octavian&#x27;s efforts and to support the existing governors of Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul in retaining their provinces against Antony. The senate&#x27;s forces, led by the two consuls and Octavian, put Antony to flight at the Battle of Mutina on 21 April 43 BC. After news of the victory, Cicero had the senate declare Antony a public enemy. But with both consuls dead, Octavian moved against the senate – both sides knew they were only using the other – and marched south to secure for himself the consulships opened by their deaths.

=== Creation, 43 BC ===
After Octavian and his forces reached Rome on 19 August 43 BC, he secured for himself election to the consulship with his cousin Quintus Pedius. They moved quickly to enact legislation confirming Octavian&#x27;s adoption as Caesar&#x27;s heir and establishing courts to condemn Caesar&#x27;s assassins &quot;in absentia&quot;. They also repealed the declaration of Antony as a public enemy. Octavian then moved north to treat with Antony under Lepidus&#x27; protection. With the Caesarian soldiers&#x27; urging, Octavian and Antony reconciled; Octavian also would marry Antony&#x27;s step-daughter Clodia. The three men then established themselves as the &quot;triumviri rei publicae constituendae&quot; (the latter words indicate a &quot;causa&quot; or commission for the reconstitution of the republic) for five years. This was confirmed by the &quot;lex Titia&quot;, proposed by a friendly tribune at their request.

The law was modelled on the &quot;lex Valeria&quot; in 82 BC which established Sulla&#x27;s dictatorship. They received power to issue legally binding edicts, were granted &quot;imperium maius&quot; which permitted them to overrule the ordinary provincial governors and to take credit for their victories, and to act (without right of appeal). They also received powers to call the senate and directly appoint magistrates and provincial governors. The legal powers given, exceeding those of the ordinary consuls, were noted on the Capitoline Fasti, which list the triumvirs above the consuls.

Octavian and Antony then prepared to wage war on the &quot;liberatores&quot; with forty total legions. They also divided the western Roman world:
* Antony would receive Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul,
* Lepidus would receive Narbonensis and Spain, and
* Octavian (then the junior partner) would receive Africa, Sardinia, and Sicily.

The triumvirs&#x27; powers were initially set to lapse on 31 December 38 BC, though the legal powers may have been retained (after their later renewal in 38 BC) all the way until 27 BC when Octavian abdicated his magistracy.

=== Proscriptions ===

In desperate need of money, the three men issued a declaration which – according to Appian – declared Caesar&#x27;s &quot;clementia&quot; to have been a failure; it was appended with a death list. Some three hundred senators and 2,000 equites were then killed; some victims escaped to Macedonia or Sicily (held by Brutus and Sextus Pompey, respectively) or were able to plead successfully for clemency. Still without sufficient funds, the triumvirs seized eighteen rich Italian towns and redistributed them to their soldiers.

The proscriptions claimed enemies and friends of the triumvirs. Cicero, whom Octavian had held in high esteem, was placed on the death lists along with his brother, nephew, and son; Cicero&#x27;s activism against Antony in the Philippicae marked him for retribution. The triumvirs themselves traded friends and family to secure the addition of their enemies to the death lists. Persons on the proscription lists had their properties confiscated and sold; freelance assassins, bounty hunters, and informers received cash rewards for aiding in the killings.

=== Liberators&#x27; civil war, 42 BC ===


Preparations for war on the tyrannicides started promptly. In Rome, the new year saw Julius Caesar consecrated as a god. With the triumvirs having slaughtered their political enemies in Italy, they moved with some forty legions against Brutus and Cassius in the east: Lepidus remained in Italy – supervised by two pro-Antony governors – while Antony and Octavian moved to cross the Adriatic for Macedonia.

While some eight legions had crossed the Adriatic early in the year, the naval forces of the &quot;liberatores&quot; and of Sextus Pompey were able to interdict the triumvir&#x27;s transports. Octavian dispatched Quintus Salvius Salvidienus Rufus against Sextus Pompey&#x27;s base of operations in Sicily, resulting in a bloody but indecisive battle near Messana. It took until summer for the triumvirs to move all their armies into Macedonia. Through early 42 BC, Brutus and Cassius were active in Asia sacking cities and forcing tribute from the provincials to pay their own soldiers. The &quot;liberatores&quot;, busy, delayed marching west (perhaps an error in retrospect); they moved to intercept Antony and Octavian only in mid-July.

The triumvirs&#x27; advance forces reached Philippi first, but were outmanoeuvred and forced to retreat. Brutus and Cassius, hugely outnumbering the advance force, reached Philippi in early September, forcing the triumvirs&#x27; advance forces to retreat. Antony and Octavian arrived some days later. The &quot;liberatores&quot; first attempted to avoid battle in light of the triumvirs&#x27; weak supply situation. But Antony was successful in forcing battle with the construction of earthworks on Cassius&#x27; flank.

The &quot;liberatores&quot; accepted battle, triggering the first battle: Brutus fought Octavian, Cassius fought Antony. Brutus&#x27; forces were successful and stormed Octavian&#x27;s camp and destroying three of Octavian&#x27;s legions. Cassius&#x27; forces, however, were less successful; Antony was able to storm Cassius&#x27; camp around the same time. Believing the battle was lost, Cassius committed suicide. In the aftermath, Cassius&#x27; forces were amalgamated into Brutus&#x27; army.

Three weeks later, on 23 October 42 BC, Brutus offered battle again, fearing desertions and possible cutting of his supply lines. In this second battle, the combined forces of Antony and Octavian defeated Brutus&#x27; army. Antony was largely the victor – Octavian apparently spent most of the first battle hiding in a marsh – and had forced the &quot;liberatores&quot; to battle and defeat twice. In the aftermath, Brutus committed suicide.

=== Antony turns east ===
In the aftermath of Philippi, Antony moved to reorganise the wealthy eastern provinces. His provinces and legions were also adduced: retaining Transalpine Gaul, he took Narbonensis from Lepidus, though he gave up Cisalpine Gaul to Italy. Octavian&#x27;s assignment was less easy: he would have the privilege of settling the veterans of Philippi in Italy and carrying on the war against Sextus Pompey in Sicily. Lepidus, however, not sharing in the glory, gave Spain to Octavian in return for Africa only. This new strategic position placed Antony at the head of an enormous advantage. His position in the east allowed him enormous resources with which he could overwhelm the west as Sulla had. His position in Gaul gave him easy access to Italy, just as Caesar had before his civil war. Moreover, while Antony would be in the east, his trusted lieutenants controlled the Gallic provinces. This strategic position placed him firmly at the head of the triumvirate.

Antony moved first against Parthia, which had aided the &quot;liberatores&quot; and was harbouring the Pompeian commander Quintus Labienus, (son of Titus Labienus who had served with Caesar during the Gallic wars and fought against him during the civil war). In the preparations for war, however, Antony found most of the east largely sucked dry by the previous armies of Dolabella, Cassius, and Brutus, and so was gentle with the areas that Brutus and Cassius had pillaged. He also displayed favour for great cultural centres and toured the eastern provinces seeking to buttress popular support.

Moving down the Mediterranean coast, Antony confirmed a number of rulers – in spite of their previous support for the &quot;liberatores&quot; or for Parthia – in Palestine and called Cleopatra to attend to him in Cilicia. Cleopatra quickly entered into an affair with Antony, which proved useful to her: Antony helped her secure her throne with the death of her sister Arsinoe and against other Ptolemaic claimants. While ancient writers speculated on Antony being manipulated by the Egyptian queen, it is more likely in this period he was merely attempting to strengthen Cleopatra&#x27;s position in Egypt as part of his policy of favouring strong allied monarchs. Regardless, he left her in the spring of 40 to embark on a campaign against Parthia.

The Parthians, in the winter of 41 BC, knowing that Antony was preparing an offensive, struck first. Invading Asia Minor and Syria under the command of Pacorus and Quintus Labienus in the early spring of 40 BC, the Parthian forces were largely unchallenged: Pacorus moved south for Palestine while Labienus moved west through Cilicia for Ionia. Antony at the time was wholly distracted from the Parthian invasion due to the Perusine War.

=== Perusine War, 41–40 BC ===


The veterans&#x27; demands for lands in Italy – in the midst of a famine, which itself was exacerbated by Sextus Pompey&#x27;s naval blockade of Italy, – caused protests and unrest throughout the Italian countryside. Antony&#x27;s brother, Lucius Antonius, serving as consul for 41 BC, and Antony&#x27;s wife Fulvia fanned the flames of this unrest to undermine Octavian. They spread propaganda indicting Octavian&#x27;s regime with stomping on citizen rights and favouring Octavian&#x27;s veterans over Antony&#x27;s. Although there was little truth behind these charges, they were largely able to build up support for a militant rising against Octavian.

Antony attempted to remain largely aloof to the goings-on, probably so he could exploit the outcome, but his supporters in Italy were largely uninformed of his intentions and readied for conflict. The consul Lucius, in the summer of 41 BC, occupied Rome with an army; however, he was beaten back by Octavian&#x27;s forces and besieged in Perusia. Unsure of Antony&#x27;s intentions, the pro-Antony governors in the two Gauls and in southern Italy stood by. Eventually, Perusia was captured: Octavian let Lucius Antonius and Fulvia go and spared Lucius&#x27; soldiers when Octavian&#x27;s own soldiers interceded; Octavian, however, sacked the town, massacred its councillors, and had it burnt to the ground.

After the death of one of the pro-Antony governors in Gaul in the summer of 40 BC, Octavian occupied the province. He also gained the support of the legions in southern Italy. Antony, concerned, hurried back to Italy from the east that same summer with substantial forces.

=== Treaties of Brundisium and Misenum, 40–39 BC ===


As relations deteriorated between Antony and Octavian, Octavian moved to woo Sextus Pompey over to his side. As part of this, he married Scribonia, Sextus&#x27; sister-in-law, in the summer of 40 BC. At the same time, however, Sextus was attempting to broker an agreement with Antony; receiving a positive response from Antony, he raided the Italian coast and took Sardinia from Octavian. Another ex-republican naval commander, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, was also induced to join Antony&#x27;s side.

When Antony sailed to Brundisium, Octavian&#x27;s garrison of five legions refused to admit him. It was then besieged. Octavian&#x27;s lieutenant Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa arrived with reinforcements but was turned back after some skirmishing. The troops on both sides, however, urged their leaders to come to terms. Octavian and Antony conducted negotiations through intermediaries (the envoys were Gaius Maecenas and Gaius Asinius Pollio, respectively). Negotiations for the treaty completed in September 40 BC:
* Octavian&#x27;s occupation of Gaul was recognised; he also would be granted Illyricum.
* Antony would be confirmed as master of the east.
* Lepidus retained Africa.
* Antony would lead a military expedition against Parthia to avenge Crassus&#x27; defeat at Carrhae.
* Octavian would either reach an agreement with or defeat Sextus Pompey.
* Amnesty would be granted for former republicans.
* Italy would be shared, but Octavian&#x27;s personal presence on the peninsula made it &quot;de facto&quot; one of his territories.

The treaty would be sealed by another marriage: Antony would wed Octavian&#x27;s sister Octavia. The announcement of peace was greatly celebrated by the people of Italy. Both dynasts celebrated ovations when entering Rome in October. But public opinion soured when they also announced new higher taxes amid further disruption of grain ships from Sextus&#x27; fleet. While in Rome, they also secured the senate&#x27;s rubber stamp for a required dispensation for Octavia&#x27;s marriage (she was not yet out of mourning for her previous husband) and for triumviral political and territorial settlements generally.

The dynasts also negotiated peace with Sextus Pompey at Misenum in the summer of 39 BC: they confirmed him in Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and the Peloponnese for five years. They promised him the consulship in 33 BC on expiration of his commands and had him elected augur. In exchange, Sextus would guarantee free passage of Italian grain ships and suppress Mediterranean piracy; his supporters also would receive amnesty and compensation for seized properties; his soldiers received the same retirement benefits as those of the triumvirs and his runaway slaves were granted freedom. The last concessions to Sextus&#x27; soldiers and slave forces were especially important for the triumvirs: with the soldiers and slaves&#x27; main grievances resolved, Sextus&#x27; military power was permanently neutered. After celebrations for this agreement, Antony departed for the east on 2 October 39 BC.

=== Renewal of the triumvirate ===

==== Antony in the east ====
While Antony was in Italy, his lieutenant Publius Ventidius scored major victories against the Parthian invasion of Asia Minor: he defeated Labienus&#x27; forces and presumably had him killed. He also won the Battle of Amanus Pass against Phranipates, the Parthian satrap of Syria, killing the satrap and forcing the Parthians to retreat beyond the Euphrates. All of these victories were won before the autumn of 39 BC.

Antony wintered in Athens and returned eastward in the spring of 38 BC. With the defence of the provinces largely complete, he prioritised reorganisations in the eastern provinces and client states. Among other boundary adjustments, he gave Cleopatra portions of eastern Cilicia and Cyprus with which to harvest timber to build a fleet. He also started to publicly identify with the god Dionysus. But before he moved further east he was drawn back to Brundisium by Octavian to discuss a worsening situation in Italy; when Octavian did not arrive promptly, he issued a public rebuke and sailed east for Syria, where he found Ventidius&#x27; victories uninterrupted. Ventidius was relieved of command by Antony and then returned to Rome to celebrate a triumph on 27 November 38 BC before dying shortly thereafter.

==== Octavian in the west ====
The agreement between Sextus Pompey and Octavian, without Antony&#x27;s presence to balance the two, started to break down in autumn 39 BC. That winter, the famine in Italy and pirate raids on grain ships continued. One of Sextus&#x27; admirals also defected to Octavian, giving Octavian back the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, along with three legions and sixty ships. Sextus, outraged, declared war.

Two large naval battles were fought in the spring of 38 BC near Cumae and near Messana. Both resulted in victories for Sextus, but he did not exploit his advantage and allowed Octavian to retire to Campania. Antony likely sought to maintain the power balance between both Octavian and Sextus for his own advantage. Octavian now requested some support after these defeats. To preserve the balance of power, Antony prepared to move west and provide support. There also was a rebellion in Gaul, which Agrippa put down by the end of 38 BC. Agrippa, loyal to Octavian and in light of Octavian&#x27;s inglorious defeat, tactfully went without a triumph.

==== Treaty of Tarentum ====
In the spring of 37 BC, Antony sailed for Italy with 300 ships. Denied entrance at Brundisium (the townsfolk suspected an invasion), he docked at Tarentum instead. Octavian travelled there to meet him. Negotiations dragged on until late July or early August. Antony apparently had to be persuaded by his wife Octavia to support Octavian against Sextus.

They agreed to strip Sextus of his augurate and future consulship. Octavian would wait a year to attack Sextus and would receive 120 ships from Antony in exchange for 20,000 men and 1,000 elite troops. The triumvirate also had uncomfortably expired at the end of 38 BC. Normal republican practice had magistrates abdicate their offices at the close of their terms; the triumvirs&#x27; terms had ended, but they had not abdicated. Nor were any successors appointed. Regardless, the legal position of the triumvirs was of little practical relevance. Making a show of constitutionalism, the triumvirate was then renewed by law for another five years, to expire on the last day of 33 BC.

=== Parthia and Sicily, 36 BC ===
Preparations for war continued apace. Agrippa, serving as consul in 37 BC, built a large harbour (the &quot;portus Julius&quot;) to train and supply troops against Sextus in Sicily. In the east, Roman client Herod retook most of Judaea; even better for the Romans, the Parthian threat disappeared amid a dynastic struggle when Orodes II abdicated in favour of his chosen successor Phraates IV, who promptly murdered his father, all of his brothers, and his own son, precipitating a revolt.

Amid a general reorganisation of the east which again strengthened client kingdoms – among a number of changes, Cleopatra received Crete and Cyrene, – Antony fathered a son with Cleopatra and publicly acknowledged his paternity of two twins born in 40 BC. This may have been related to strengthening Antony and Cleopatra&#x27;s positions in Egypt and building popular support there; even if so, the relationship was unpopular in Italy and Antony should have known this.

==== Parthian campaign ====

Antony demanded the return of Crassus&#x27; eagles from Phraates; Phraates, needing to ensure his own position, refused. Antony struck north towards Armenia, where he was joined by detachments from allied kings and a Roman governor. With sixteen legions and many auxiliaries, he drove south into Persia. Moving quickly without his siege engines, he arrived to Phraata, the Parthian capital, but then discovered that his slow-moving siege engines had been intercepted and destroyed. He was then abandoned by Artavasdes, the Armenian king; Antony, while successful in some defences, was unable to effectively counter the swift Parthian cavalry.

Abandoning the siege, he was forced into a difficult retreat with few supplies and harried by Parthian archers. Over 27 days, the army returned after a famous display of resilience and valour, to Armenia. Reaching an agreement with Artavasdes, Antony continued to retreat through the winter until he reached Cappadocia. In total, he lost around a third of his entire army.

The failure of the Parthian campaign fatally damaged Antony&#x27;s military prestige and power. If it had been successful, it would clearly placed him above Octavian; but after its failure, Antony&#x27;s fortunes turned for the worse.

==== Sicily ====

Agrippa prepared exhaustively for Octavian&#x27;s campaign against Sicily. Octavian also was able to secure support from Lepidus in Africa, who possibly had plans of his own. In July 36 BC, Octavian and Lepidus launched a three-pronged attack on Sicily with Octavian&#x27;s forces landing in the north and east while Lepidus landed in the south.

Initially, Octavian&#x27;s naval forces were beset by storms. Lepidus&#x27; forces, however, successfully effected a landing in his theatre and placed one of Sextus&#x27; lieutenants under siege in Lilybaeum. In the north and east, there were naval battles: Octavian was personally defeated off Tauromenium while Agrippa was victorious off Mylae. Even so, Sextus&#x27; forces were stretched thin and Octavian was able to effect landings of 21 legions onto the island. A decisive naval battle ended the campaign, with Agrippa defeating Sextus near Naulochus on 3 September 36 BC. Sextus, able to muster only 17 ships, fled for Antony in the east.

Lepidus, buoyed by victory, attempted to suborn Octavian&#x27;s troops. After accepting the surrender of Sextus Pompey&#x27;s legions, he attempted to negotiate with Octavian to exchange Sicily and Africa for his old provinces of Narbonensis and Spain. Octavian, walking into Lepidus&#x27; camp almost unaccompanied, secured the loyalty of the soldiers; defeated, Lepidus was then stripped of membership in the triumvirate and his provincial commands. Kept in his property, life, and the title of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, Lepidus was forced into exile and retirement.

== Breakdown ==

With the three reduced to two, Octavian started to prepare for a showdown against Antony. He furthered his attempts to link Antony with Cleopatra and drilled his troops in Illyricum near the dividing line of the provinces. Antony, however, was slow to respond and was focused on the far east against Armenia. In the interim, Sextus arrived in Antony&#x27;s provinces, where he was caught and executed, though Antony erected some cover of plausible deniability for the actions.

Octavian&#x27;s troops, believing Octavian&#x27;s propaganda about having brought to an end the civil wars and restoring peace, started to demand demobilisation. While some of the longest-serving were released, Octavian was keenly aware of his need to keep his men mobilised. To that end, he offered some donatives and a ploy about spoils in Illyricum. He also offered an embassy led by Octavia to transfer to Antony about half of his lent ships and 2, 000 elite men – nowhere near the 20, 000 promised at Tarentum – which had the effect of forcing Antony to choose between accepting Octavian&#x27;s so-called repayment or insulting his wife in the eyes of the Italians. Antony accepted his wife&#x27;s troops but bade her to winter in Athens while he went back to Alexandria to stay with Cleopatra.

=== Propaganda war, 34 BC ===

Antony, through treacherous means, tricked the Armenian king Artavasdes into a meeting in 34 BC. Capturing the Armenian king, he occupied his country and then paraded him in a Dionysiac procession in Alexandria. Octavian&#x27;s propaganda seized on the procession as a sacrilege and betrayal of Rome&#x27;s gods. Antony also engaged on an unwise ceremony, the &quot;donations of Alexandria&quot;, where he crowned his children with Cleopatra as oriental monarchs. These antics went down very poorly in Rome. In a political climate which blamed the civil wars on a collapse of public morality, Octavian was able to link Antony with oriental immorality under Cleopatra&#x27;s influence.

Antony and his supporters, of course, responded: they alleged Octavian to be a coward; they objected to Octavian&#x27;s shabby treatment of Lepidus; they accused Octavian of monopolising all the land in Italy for his own veterans; they also made allegations that Octavian was stealing ex-consuls&#x27; wives and prostituting his daughter Julia to foreign kings.

While the propaganda war was raging, Octavian campaigned in Illyricum; he was successful at defeating, with overwhelming force, a number of barbarian tribes. Able to keep his soldiers in arms and build their experience, he celebrated with friendly generals a large number of triumphs; those triumphs also financed, from the spoils, building and renovation projects in Rome. Octavian and Antony competed on building new public works in the city. Octavian&#x27;s ally Agrippa also engaged in renovations of the sewers and aqueducts; and during a term as aedile in 33 BC, sponsored spectacular games and public donations.

=== End of the triumvirate, 32–30 BC ===


The triumvirate&#x27;s legal term expired on 31 December 33 BC (Octavian&#x27;s holding of his triumviral legal powers may have continued to 27 BC). In the new year, Octavian used force to drive the potentially resurgent consuls from Rome after one of the consuls started to publicly attack him. The consuls fled to the east and Antony with several hundred senators, which Antony organised into a &quot;counter-senate&quot;.

Antony started to move his massive army, of some 100,000 men and 800 ships, west towards Greece. His men debated whether or not they should permit Cleopatra to stay with them: the main argument to remove her was that her presence would further Octavian&#x27;s propaganda depicting a war on the east; however, removing her would also demoralise some of their own forces, who were fighting for their queen against Rome rather than for Antony, a Roman general. Arriving in Athens, Antony divorced Octavia; the choice of removing his Roman wife to stay with his Egyptian mistress alienated Italian public opinion.

Lucius Munatius Plancus then fled Antony&#x27;s camp for Octavian&#x27;s. Upon his arrival, he recommend that Octavian open Antony&#x27;s will, legally sealed with the Vestal Virgins. Opening it, Octavian allegedly found that Antony planned to be buried in Alexandria, would recognise Caesarion as Caesar&#x27;s son, and give large portions of Roman lands to his children with Cleopatra. It is likely that Octavian may have invented provisions: the Vestals in Rome would not have seen the sealed will; some provisions may have been alleged which Antony would find uncomfortable to deny (losing eastern support) or admit (losing western support).

Antony&#x27;s forces in Greece provoked panic in Italy; Octavian, no longer calling himself triumvir (but retaining his provincial commands) organised defence of the peninsula. He organised a civil oath to his personal leadership, unprecedented in republican history. Declaring war on Cleopatra, Octavian also had the republic strip Antony of his legal position.

Early in the campaigning season of 31 BC, Agrippa launched a series of surprise attacks on the western Greek harbours under Antony&#x27;s control. Octavian moved quickly to take beachheads on the Greek mainland near Corcyra. After cutting off Antony&#x27;s supplies and escape by land, Antony and Cleopatra engaged in a sea battle, attempting to break out with his remaining fleet. They fought Octavian on 2 September 31 BC at the Battle of Actium. Antony and Cleopatra were able to flee through a gap in the line, which was the plan, but most of his fleet did not follow and returned to port. After the battle, most of his forces in Greece surrendered.

After a number of defections to Octavian – both Roman governors and client kings – through the winter of 31 and 30 BC, Antony&#x27;s remaining forces were only those in the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Troubled by demands from his soldiers for land, and only able to solve them with large-scale land purchases, Octavian marched on Egypt in pursuit of its booty. He marched overland on the Mediterranean coast. He engaged negotiations with Cleopatra but they broke down by July 30 BC. Later that month, Octavian arrived at Alexandria and on 1 August, took and sacked the city. He killed Caesarion and Antony&#x27;s heir, Antyllus, but captured Cleopatra&#x27;s children for his triumph. Cleopatra and Antony committed suicide.

== Legacy ==

=== In formation of the Principate ===

The ascendancy of Octavian at the triumvirate&#x27;s close was closely followed by his constitutional &quot;settlements&quot; and the formation of the Principate and the Roman empire. The creation of the triumvirate and its system of absolute rule, however, was not then known to be permanent. Even in the imperial period, writers like Tacitus reflected on how the republic had been dominated by single men before. Moreover, it was not inevitable that the triumvirs were going to defeat the &quot;liberatores&quot;. Their successful campaign, culminating at Philippi, was recognised in coming generations as a turning point in the republic&#x27;s history. Tacitus, for example, dates the end of the republic to the triumviral victory there, which left the republic defenceless and &quot;nulla iam publica arma&quot; (i.e., the republic was disarmed). Erich Gruen, in &quot;Last generation of the Roman republic&quot;, attributes the republic&#x27;s collapse to the long and brutal conflicts after Caesar&#x27;s assassination, largely fought by (and then between) the triumvirs, which eventually &quot;made it impossible to pick up the pieces&quot;.

The mass violence of triumviral rule and their untraditional form of government was contemporaneously seen as illegitimate. To combat such charges, the triumvirs attempted to preserve the appearance of republican practices and legality. Of course, the extent to which the triumvirate heeded republican traditions changed over time. Over time, as the political situation stabilised, Octavian in Rome resumed the normal operation of the consulship (rather than appointment of many and multiple suffect consulships in a single year).

The traditional magistrates did not yield all of their duties to the triumvirs; they were still expected to and did conduct public business. Moreover, the consuls still exercised some degree of independent political authority. The traditional means of moving legislation before the senate and the assemblies also was not abandoned: the triumvirs moved multiple laws before the people on diverse subjects such as extending citizenship, ratification of Antony&#x27;s eastern settlements, extension of the triumvirate, and expanding the patriciate. While the mere operation of the republic&#x27;s institutional machinery did not represent a free state, the triumvirs made a show of following traditional legal niceties. The triumvirs at various times also made repeated promises or offers to give their powers back to the senate and people, though of course these promises were never kept. Most especially, the triumvirs&#x27; powers to appoint all provincial governors served as part of the division between military and civic provinces later adopted in Augustus&#x27; political settlements.

=== In Roman culture ===
The political chaos of the triumviral years proved a ladder for many provincials, veterans, and former slaves. Many of the great works of Latin literature were produced in this unstable period, such as Horace&#x27;s &quot;Epodes&quot; and &quot;Satires&quot;, Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot; and &quot;Georgics&quot;, and the histories of Sallust and Asinius Pollio. The political competition between Octavian and Antony provided the impetus for Octavian&#x27;s ally, Gaius Maecenas, to support many leading artists of his day.

Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot;, for example, shed light on the fears of shepherds and herdsmen in rural Italy during Octavian&#x27;s land confiscations when he sought lands to settle veterans in the aftermath of Philippi. The proscriptions also proved a topic of embellishment; many stories are told of the plight of victims and their attempts to escape. Cicero&#x27;s plight during the proscriptions, especially, was a recurrent topic in ancient schools of oratory.

<text>Pseudoephedrine, sold under the brand name Sudafed among others, is a sympathomimetic medication which is used as a decongestant to treat nasal congestion. It has also been used off-label for certain other indications, like treatment of low blood pressure. At higher doses, it may produce various additional effects including stimulant, appetite suppressant, and performance-enhancing effects. In relation to this, non-medical use of pseudoephedrine has been encountered. The medication is taken by mouth.
Side effects of pseudoephedrine include insomnia, elevated heart rate, increased blood pressure, restlessness, dizziness, anxiety, and dry mouth, among others. Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been associated with serious cardiovascular complications like heart attack and hemorrhagic stroke. Some people may be more sensitive to its cardiovascular effects. Pseudoephedrine acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent, thereby indirectly activating adrenergic receptors. As such, it is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Pseudoephedrine significantly crosses into the brain, but has some peripheral selectivity due to its hydrophilicity. Chemically, pseudoephedrine is a substituted amphetamine and is closely related to ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, and amphetamine. It is the (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-enantiomer of β-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-methylamphetamine.
Along with ephedrine, pseudoephedrine occurs naturally in ephedra, which has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine. It was first isolated from ephedra in 1889. Subsequent to its synthesis in the 1920s, pseudoephedrine was introduced for medical use as a decongestant. Pseudoephedrine is widely available over-the-counter (OTC) in both single-drug and combination preparations. Availability of pseudoephedrine has been restricted starting in 2005 as it can be used to synthesize methamphetamine. Phenylephrine has replaced pseudoephedrine in many over-the-counter oral decongestant products. However, oral phenylephrine appears to be ineffective as a decongestant. In 2022, the combination with brompheniramine and dextromethorphan was the 265th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions. In 2022, the combination with loratadine was the 289th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions.
==Medical uses==

===Nasal congestion===
Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic and is well-known for shrinking swollen nasal mucous membranes, so it is often used as a decongestant. It reduces tissue hyperemia, edema, and nasal congestion commonly associated with colds or allergies. Other beneficial effects may include increasing the drainage of sinus secretions, and opening of obstructed Eustachian tubes. The same vasoconstriction action can also result in hypertension, which is a noted side effect of pseudoephedrine.

Pseudoephedrine can be used either as oral or as topical decongestant. Due to its stimulating qualities, however, the oral preparation is more likely to cause adverse effects, including urinary retention. According to one study, pseudoephedrine may show effectiveness as an antitussive drug (suppression of cough).

Pseudoephedrine is indicated for the treatment of nasal congestion, sinus congestion, and Eustachian tube congestion. Pseudoephedrine is also indicated for vasomotor rhinitis and as an adjunct to other agents in the optimum treatment of allergic rhinitis, croup, sinusitis, otitis media, and tracheobronchitis.

===Other uses===
Amphetamine-type stimulants and other catecholaminergic agents are known to have wakefulness-promoting effects and are used in the treatment of hypersomnia and narcolepsy. Pseudoephedrine at therapeutic doses does not appear to improve or worsen daytime sleepiness, daytime fatigue, or sleep quality in people with allergic rhinitis. Likewise, somnolence was not lower in children with the common cold treated with pseudoephedrine for nasal congestion. In any case, insomnia is a known side effect of pseudoephedrine, although the incidence is low. In addition, doses of pseudoephedrine above the normal therapeutic range have been reported to produce stimulant effects including insomnia and fatigue resistance.

There has been interest in pseudoephedrine as an appetite suppressant for the treatment of obesity. However, due to lack of clinical data and potential cardiovascular side effects, this use is not recommended. Only a single placebo-controlled study of pseudoephedrine for weight loss exists (120mg/day slow-release for 12weeks) and found no significant difference in weight lost compared to placebo (-4.6kg vs. -4.5kg). This was in contrast to phenylpropanolamine, which has been found to be more effective at promoting weight loss compared to placebo and has been more widely studied and used in the treatment of obesity.

Pseudoephedrine has been used limitedly in the treatment of orthostatic intolerance including orthostatic hypotension and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). However, its effectiveness in the treatment of POTS is controversial. Pseudoephedrine has also been used limitedly in the treatment of refractory hypotension in intensive care units. However, data on this use are limited to case reports and case series.

Pseudoephedrine is also used as a first-line prophylactic for recurrent priapism. Erection is largely a parasympathetic response, so the sympathetic action of pseudoephedrine may serve to relieve this condition. Data for this use are however anecdotal and effectiveness has been described as variable.

Treatment of urinary incontinence is an off-label use for pseudoephedrine and related medications.

===Available forms===
Pseudoephedrine is available by itself over-the-counter in the form of 30 and 60mg immediate-release and 120 and 240mg extended-release oral tablets in the United States.

Pseudoephedrine is also available over-the-counter and prescription-only in combination with numerous other drugs, including antihistamines (acrivastine, azatadine, brompheniramine, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, desloratadine, dexbrompheniramine, diphenhydramine, fexofenadine, loratadine, triprolidine), analgesics (acetaminophen, codeine, hydrocodone, ibuprofen, naproxen), cough suppressants (dextromethorphan), and expectorants (guaifenesin).

Pseudoephedrine has been used in the form of the hydrochloride and sulfate salts and in a polistirex form. The drug has been used in more than 135 over-the-counter and prescription formulations. Many prescription formulations containing pseudoephedrine have been discontinued over time.

==Contraindications==
Pseudoephedrine is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, severe or uncontrolled hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, prostatic hypertrophy, hyperthyroidism, closed-angle glaucoma, or by pregnant women. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.

==Side effects==
Common side effects with pseudoephedrine therapy may include central nervous system (CNS) stimulation, insomnia, restlessness, excitability, dizziness, and anxiety. Infrequent side effects include tachycardia or palpitations. Rarely, pseudoephedrine therapy may be associated with mydriasis (dilated pupils), hallucinations, arrhythmias, hypertension, seizures, and ischemic colitis; as well as severe skin reactions known as recurrent pseudo-scarlatina, systemic contact dermatitis, and non-pigmenting fixed drug eruption. Pseudoephedrine, particularly when combined with other drugs including narcotics, may also play a role in the precipitation of episodes of psychosis. It has also been reported that pseudoephedrine, among other sympathomimetic agents, may be associated with the occurrence of hemorrhagic stroke and other cardiovascular complications.

Due to its sympathomimetic effects, pseudoephedrine is a vasoconstrictor and pressor agent (increases blood pressure), a positive chronotrope (increases heart rate), and a positive inotrope (increases force of heart contractions). The influence of pseudoephedrine on blood pressure at clinical doses is controversial. A closely related sympathomimetic and decongestant, phenylpropanolamine, was withdrawn due to associations with markedly increased blood pressure and incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. There has been concern that pseudoephedrine may likewise dangerously increase blood pressure and thereby increase the risk of stroke, whereas others have contended that the risks are exaggerated. Besides hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary vasospasm, and sudden death have also rarely been reported with sympathomimetic ephedra compounds like pseudoephedrine and ephedrine.

A 2005 meta-analysis found that pseudoephedrine at recommended doses had no meaningful effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure in healthy individuals or people with controlled hypertension. Systolic blood pressure was found to slightly increase by 0.99mmHg on average and heart rate was found to slightly increase by 2.83bpm on average. Conversely, there was no significant influence on diastolic blood pressure, which increased by 0.63mgHg. In people with controlled hypertension, systolic hypertension increased by a similar degree of 1.20mmHg. Immediate-release preparations, higher doses, being male, and shorter duration of use were all associated with greater cardiovascular effects. A small subset of individuals with autonomic instability, perhaps in turn resulting in greater adrenergic receptor sensitivity, may be substantially more sensitive to the cardiovascular effects of sympathomimetics. Subsequent to the 2005 meta-analysis, a 2015 systematic review and a 2018 meta-analysis found that pseudoephedrine at high doses (&gt;170mg) could increase heart rate and physical performance with larger effect sizes than lower doses.

A 2007 Cochrane review assessed the side effects of short-term use of pseudoephedrine at recommended doses as a nasal decongestant. It found that pseudoephedrine had a small risk of insomnia and this was the only side effect that occurred at rates significantly different from placebo. Insomnia occurred at a rate of 5% and had an odds ratio (OR) of 6.18. Other side effects, including headache and hypertension, occurred at rates of less than 4% and were not different from placebo.

Tachyphylaxis is known to develop with prolonged use of pseudoephedrine, especially when it is re-administered at short intervals.

There is a case report of temporary depressive symptoms upon discontinuation and withdrawal from pseudoephedrine. The withdrawal symptoms included worsened mood and sadness, profoundly decreased energy, a worsened view of oneself, decreased concentration, psychomotor retardation, increased appetite, and increased need for sleep.

Pseudoephedrine has psychostimulant effects at high doses and is a positive reinforcer with amphetamine-like effects in animals including rats and monkeys. However, it is substantially less potent than methamphetamine or cocaine.

==Overdose==
The maximum total daily dose of pseudoephedrine is 240mg. Symptoms of overdose may include sedation, apnea, impaired concentration, cyanosis, coma, circulatory collapse, insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions, headache, dizziness, anxiety, euphoria, tinnitus, blurred vision, ataxia, chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, increased blood pressure, decreased blood pressure, thirstiness, sweating, difficulty with urination, nausea, and vomiting. In children, symptoms have more often included dry mouth, pupil dilation, hot flashes, fever, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Pseudoephedrine may produce toxic effects both with use of supratherapeutic doses but also in people who are more sensitive to the effects of sympathomimetics. Misuse of the drug has been reported in one case at massive doses of 3,000 to 4,500mg (100–150×30-mg tablets) per day, with the doses gradually increased over time by this individual. No fatalities due to pseudoephedrine misuse have been reported as of 2021. However, death with pseudoephedrine has been reported generally.

==Interactions==
Concomitant or recent (previous 14days) monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) use can lead to hypertensive reactions, including hypertensive crisis, and should be avoided. Clinical studies have found minimal or no influence of certain MAOIs like the weak non-selective MAOI linezolid and the potent selective MAO-B inhibitor selegiline (as a transdermal patch) on the pharmacokinetics of pseudoephedrine. This is in accordance with the fact that pseudoephedrine is not metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO). However, pseudoephedrine induces the release of norepinephrine, which MAOIs inhibit the metabolism of, and as such, MAOIs can still potentiate the effects of pseudoephedrine. No significant pharmacodynamic interactions have been found with selegiline, but linezolid potentiated blood pressure increases with pseudoephedrine. However, this was deemed to be without clinical significance in the case of linezolid, though it was noted that some individuals may be more sensitive to the sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine and related agents. Pseudoephedrine is contraindicated with MAOIs like phenelzine, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, and moclobemide due to the potential for synergistic sympathomimetic effects and hypertensive crisis. It is also considered to be contraindicated with linezolid and selegiline as some individuals may react more sensitively to coadministration.

Concomitant use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors, including ergot alkaloids like ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, linezolid, oxytocin, ephedrine, phenylephrine, and bromocriptine, among others, is not recommended due to the possibility of greater increases in blood pressure and risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Sympathomimetic effects and cardiovascular risks of pseudoephedrine may also be increased with digitalis glycosides, tricyclic antidepressants, appetite suppressants, and inhalational anesthetics. Likewise, greater sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine may occur when it is combined with other sympathomimetic agents. Rare but serious cardiovascular complications have been reported with the combination of pseudoephedrine and bupropion. Increase of ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. The antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, guanethidine, mecamylamine, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by sympathomimetics like pseudoepehdrine. Beta blockers like labetalol may reduce the effects of pseudoephedrine.

Urinary acidifying agents like ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride can increase the excretion of and thereby reduce exposure to amphetamines including pseudoephedrine, whereas urinary alkalinizing agents including antacids like sodium bicarbonate as well as acetazolamide can reduce the excretion of these agents and thereby increase exposure to them.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic agent which acts primarily or exclusively by inducing the release of norepinephrine. Hence, it is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Some sources state that pseudoephedrine has a mixed mechanism of action consisting of both indirect and direct effects by binding to and acting as an agonist of adrenergic receptors. However, the affinity of pseudoephedrine for adrenergic receptors is described as very low or negligible. Animal studies suggest that the sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine are exclusively due to norepinephrine release.

Pseudoephedrine induces monoamine release &quot;in vitro&quot; with an of 224nM for norepinephrine and 1,988nM for dopamine, whereas it is inactive for serotonin. As such, it is about 9-fold selective for induction of norepinephrine release over dopamine release. The drug has negligible agonistic activity at the α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors (Kact &gt;10,000nM). At the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, it acts as a partial agonist with relatively low affinity (β1 = Kact = 309μM, = 53%; β2 = 10μM; = 47%). It was an antagonist or very weak partial agonist of the β3-adrenergic receptor (Kact = ; = 7%). It is about 30,000 to 40,000times less potent as a β-adrenergic receptor agonist than (–)-isoproterenol.

Pseudoephedrine&#x27;s principal mechanism of action relies on its action on the adrenergic system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomson/Micromedex 2007 2452&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The vasoconstriction that pseudoephedrine produces is believed to be principally an α-adrenergic receptor response. Pseudoephedrine acts on α- and β2-adrenergic receptors, to cause vasoconstriction and relaxation of smooth muscle in the bronchi, respectively. α-Adrenergic receptors are located on the muscles lining the walls of blood vessels. When these receptors are activated, the muscles contract, causing the blood vessels to constrict (vasoconstriction). The constricted blood vessels now allow less fluid to leave the blood vessels and enter the nose, throat, and sinus linings, which results in decreased inflammation of nasal membranes, as well as decreased mucus production. Thus, by constriction of blood vessels, mainly those located in the nasal passages, pseudoephedrine causes a decrease in the symptoms of nasal congestion. Activation of β2-adrenergic receptors produces relaxation of the smooth muscle of the bronchi, causing bronchial dilation and in turn decreasing congestion (although not fluid) and difficulty breathing.

Pseudoephedrine is less potent as a sympathomimetic and psychostimulant than ephedrine. Clinical studies have found that pseudoephedrine is about 3.5- to 4-fold less potent than ephedrine as a sympathomimetic agent in terms of blood pressure increases and 3.5- to 7.2-fold or more less potent as a bronchodilator. Pseudoephedrine is also said to have much less central effect than ephedrine and to be only a weak psychostimulant. Blood vessels in the nose are around five times more sensitive than the heart to the actions of circulating epinephrine (adrenaline), which may help to explain how pseudoephedrine at the low doses used in over-the-counter products can produce nasal decongestion with minimal effects on the heart. Compared to dextroamphetamine, pseudoephedrine is about 30 to 35times less potent as a norepinephrine releasing agent and 80 to 350times less potent as a dopamine releasing agent &quot;in vitro&quot;.

Pseudoephedrine is a very weak reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) &quot;in vitro&quot;, including both MAO-A and MAO-B (Ki = 1,000–5,800μM). It is far less potent in this action than other agents like dextroamphetamine and moclobemide.

===Pharmacokinetics===
====Absorption====
Pseudoephedrine is orally active and is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Its oral bioavailability is approximately 100%. The drug reaches peak concentrations after 1 to 4hours (mean 1.9hours) in the case of the immediate-release formulation and after 2 to 6hours in the case of the extended-release formulation. The onset of action of pseudoephedrine is 30minutes.

====Distribution====
Pseudoephedrine, due to its lack of polar phenolic groups, is relatively lipophilic. This is a property it shares with related sympathomimetic and decongestant agents like ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. These agents are widely distributed throughout the body and cross the blood–brain barrier. However, it is said that pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine cross the blood-brain barrier only to some extent and that pseudoephedrine has limited central nervous system activity, suggesting that it is partially peripherally selective. The blood-brain barrier permeability of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine is reduced compared to other amphetamines due to the presence of a hydroxyl group at the β carbon which decreases their lipophilicity. As such, they have a greater ratio of peripheral cardiovascular to central psychostimulant effect. Besides entering the brain, these substances also cross the placenta and enter breast milk.

The plasma protein binding of pseudoephedrine has been reported to be approximately 21 to 29%. It is bound to α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and albumin (HSA).

====Metabolism====
Pseudoephedrine is not extensively metabolized and is subjected to minimal first-pass metabolism with oral administration. Due to its methyl group at the α carbon (i.e., it is an amphetamine), pseudoephedrine is not a substrate for monoamine oxidase (MAO) and is not metabolized by this enzyme. It is also not metabolized by catechol &quot;O&quot;-methyltransferase (COMT). Pseudoephedrine is demethylated into the metabolite norpseudoephedrine to a small extent. Similarly to pseudoephedrine, this metabolite is active and shows amphetamine-like effects. Approximately 1 to 6% of pseudoephedrine is metabolized in the liver via &quot;N&quot;-demethylation to form norpseudoephedrine.

====Elimination====
Pseudoephedrine is excreted primarily via the kidneys in urine. Its urinary excretion is highly influenced by urinary pH and is decreased when the urine is acidic and is increased when it is alkaline.

The elimination half-life of pseudoephedrine on average is 5.4hours and ranges from 3 to 16hours depending on urinary pH. At a pH of 5.6 to 6.0, the elimination half-life of pseudoephedrine was 5.2 to 8.0hours. In one study, a more acidic pH of 5.0 resulted in a half-life of 3.0 to 6.4hours, whereas a more alkaline pH of 8.0 resulted in a half-life of 9.2 to 16.0hours. Substances that influence urinary acidity and are known to affect the excretion of amphetamine derivatives include urinary acidifying agents like ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride as well as urinary alkalinizing agents like acetazolamide.

A majority of an oral dose of pseudoephedrine is excreted unchanged in urine within 24hours of administration. This has been found to range from 43 to 96%. The amount excreted unchanged is dependent on urinary pH similarly to the drug&#x27;s half-life, as a longer half-life and duration in the body allows more time for the drug to be metabolized.

The duration of action of pseudoephedrine, which is dependent on its elimination, is 4 to 12hours.

Pseudoephedrine has been reported to accumulate in people with renal impairment.

==Chemistry==
Pseudoephedrine, also known structurally as (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-α,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyl-β-hydroxyphenethylamine or as (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-&quot;N&quot;-methyl-β-hydroxyamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine, amphetamine, and β-hydroxyamphetamine derivative. It is a diastereomer of ephedrine.

Pseudoephedrine is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C10H15NO and a molecular weight of 165.23g/mol. It has an experimental log P of 0.89, while its predicted log P values range from 0.9 to 1.32. The compound is relatively lipophilic, but is also more hydrophilic than other amphetamines. The lipophilicity of amphetamines is closely related to their brain permeability. For comparison to pseudoephedrine, the experimental log P of methamphetamine is 2.1, of amphetamine is 1.8, of ephedrine is 1.1, of phenylpropanolamine is 0.7, of phenylephrine is -0.3, and of norepinephrine is -1.2. Methamphetamine has high brain permeability, whereas phenylephrine and norepinephrine are peripherally selective drugs. The optimal log P for brain permeation and central activity is about 2.1 (range 1.5–2.7).

Pseudoephedrine is readily reduced into methamphetamine or oxidized into methcathinone.

===Nomenclatures===
The dextrorotary (+)- or d- enantiomer is (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-pseudoephedrine, whereas the levorotating (−)- or l- form is (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-pseudoephedrine.

In the outdated system (+)-pseudoephedrine is also referred to as pseudoephedrine and (−)-pseudoephedrine as pseudoephedrine (in the Fisher projection then the phenyl ring is drawn at bottom).

Often the system (with small caps) and the d/l system (with lower-case) are confused. The result is that the dextrorotary d-pseudoephedrine is wrongly named pseudoephedrine and the levorotary l-ephedrine (the diastereomer) wrongly ephedrine.

The IUPAC names of the two enantiomers are (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)- respectively (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-2-methylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol. Synonyms for both are &quot;psi&quot;-ephedrine and &quot;threo&quot;-ephedrine.

Pseudoephedrine is the of the (+)-form, when used as pharmaceutical substance.

===Detection in body fluids===
Pseudoephedrine may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to monitor any possible performance-enhancing use by athletes, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Some commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with pseudoephedrine, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish pseudoephedrine from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma pseudoephedrine concentrations are typically in the 50 to 300μg/L range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 500 to 3,000μg/L in people with substance use disorder involving pseudoephedrine or poisoned patients, and 10 to 70mg/L in cases of acute fatal overdose.

==Manufacturing==
Although pseudoephedrine occurs naturally as an alkaloid in certain plant species (for example, as a constituent of extracts from the &quot;Ephedra&quot; species, also known as &quot;ma huang&quot;, in which it occurs together with other isomers of ephedrine), the majority of pseudoephedrine produced for commercial use is derived from yeast fermentation of dextrose in the presence of benzaldehyde. In this process, specialized strains of yeast (typically a variety of &quot;Candida utilis&quot; or &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;) are added to large vats containing water, dextrose and the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (such as found in beets and other plants). After the yeast has begun fermenting the dextrose, the benzaldehyde is added to the vats, and in this environment, the yeast converts the ingredients to the precursor l-phenylacetylcarbinol (L-PAC). L-PAC is then chemically converted to pseudoephedrine via reductive amination.

The bulk of pseudoephedrine is produced by commercial pharmaceutical manufacturers in India and China, where economic and industrial conditions favor its mass production for export.

==History==
Pseudoephedrine, along with ephedrine, occurs naturally in ephedra. This herb has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine. Pseudoephedrine was first isolated and characterized in 1889 by the German chemists Ladenburg and Oelschlägel, who used a sample that had been isolated from &quot;Ephedra vulgaris&quot; by the Merck pharmaceutical corporation of Darmstadt, Germany. It was first synthesized in the 1920s in Japan. Subsequently, pseudoephedrine was introduced for medical use as a decongestant.

===Recreational use===
Over-the-counter pseudoephedrine has been misused as a psychostimulant. Six case reports and one case series of pseudoephedrine misuse have been published as of 2021. There is a case report of self-medication with pseudoephedrine in massive doses for treatment of depression.

===Use in exercise and sports===
Pseudoephedrine has been used as a performance-enhancing drug in exercise and sports due to its sympathomimetic and stimulant effects. Because of these effects, pseudoephedrine can increase heart rate, elevate blood pressure, improve mental energy, and reduce fatigue, among other performance-enhancing effects.

A 2015 systematic review found that pseudoephedrine lacked performance-enhancing effects at therapeutic doses (60–120mg) but significantly enhanced athletic performance at supratherapeutic doses (≥180mg). A subsequent 2018 meta-analysis, which included seven additional studies, found that pseudoephedrine had a small positive effect on heart rate ( = 0.43) but insignificant effects on time trials, perceived exertion ratings, blood glucose levels, and blood lactate levels. However, subgroup analyses revealed that effect sizes were larger for heart rate increases and quicker time trials in well-trained athletes and younger participants, for shorter exercise sessions with pseudoephedrine administered within 90minutes beforehand, and with higher doses of pseudoephedrine. A dose–response relationship was established, with larger doses (&gt;170mg) showing greater increases in heart rate and faster time trials than with smaller doses (≤170mg) ( = 0.85 for heart rate and = -0.24 for time trials, respectively). In any case, the meta-analysis concluded that the performance-enhancing effects of pseudoephedrine were marginal to small and likely to be lower in magnitude than with caffeine. It is relevant in this regard that caffeine is a permitted stimulant in competitive sports.

Pseudoephedrine was on the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s (IOC) banned substances list until 2004 when the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list replaced the IOC list. Although WADA initially only &quot;monitored&quot; pseudoephedrine, it went back onto the &quot;banned&quot; list on 1 January 2010.

Pseudoephedrine is excreted through urine, and the concentration in urine of this drug shows a large inter-individual spread; that is, the same dose can give a vast difference in urine concentration for different individuals. Pseudoephedrine is approved to be taken up to 240 mg per day. In seven healthy male subjects, this dose yielded a urine concentration range of 62.8 to 294.4 microgram per milliliter (μg/mL) with mean ± standard deviation 149 ± 72 μg/mL. Thus, normal dosage of 240 mg pseudoephedrine per day can result in urine concentration levels exceeding the limit of 150 μg/mL set by WADA for about half of all users. Furthermore, hydration status does not affect the urinary concentration of pseudoephedrine.

====List of doping cases====
* Canadian rower Silken Laumann was stripped of her 1995 Pan American Games team gold medal after testing positive for pseudoephedrine.
* In February 2000, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze won gold at the 2000 European Figure Skating Championships but were stripped of their medals after Berezhnaya tested positive. This resulted in a three-month disqualification from the date of the test, and the medal being stripped. She stated that she had taken cold medication approved by a doctor but had failed to inform the ISU as required. The pair missed the World Championships that year as a result of the disqualification.
* Romanian gymnast Andreea Răducan was stripped of her gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games after testing positive. She took two pills given to her by the team coach for a cold. Although she was stripped of the overall gold medal, she kept her other medals, and, unlike in most other doping cases, was not banned from competing again; only the team doctor was banned for a number of years. Ion Țiriac, the president of the Romanian Olympic Committee, resigned over the scandal.
* In the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, the IOC issued a reprimand against the Slovak ice hockey player Lubomir Visnovsky for usage of pseudoephedrine.
* In the 2014 Winter Olympic Games Team Sweden and Washington Capitals ice hockey player Nicklas Bäckström was prevented from playing in the final for usage of pseudoephedrine. Bäckström claimed he was using it as allergy medication. In March 2014, the IOC Disciplinary Commission decided that Bäckström would be awarded the silver medal. In January 2015 Bäckström, the IOC, WADA and the IIHF agreed to a settlement in which he accepted a reprimand but was cleared of attempting to enhance his performance.

===Manufacture of amphetamines===
Its membership in the amphetamine class has made pseudoephedrine a sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone. As a result of the increasing regulatory restrictions on the sale and distribution of pseudoephedrine, pharmaceutical firms have reformulated medications to use alternative compounds, particularly phenylephrine, even though its efficacy as an oral decongestant has been demonstrated to be indistinguishable from placebo.

In the United States, federal laws control the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. Retailers in the US have created corporate policies restricting the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. Their policies restrict sales by limiting purchase quantities and requiring a minimum age and government issued photographic identification. These requirements are similar to and sometimes more stringent than existing law. Internationally, pseudoephedrine is listed as a Table I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.

===Legal status===
====Australia====
Illicit diversion of pseudoephedrine in Australia has caused significant changes to the way the products are regulated. , all products containing pseudoephedrine have been rescheduled as either &quot;Pharmacist Only Medicines&quot; (Schedule 3) or &quot;Prescription Only Medicines&quot; (Schedule 4), depending on the amount of pseudoephedrine in the product. A Pharmacist Only Medicine may only be sold to the public if a pharmacist is directly involved in the transaction. These medicines must be kept behind the counter, away from public access.

Pharmacists are also encouraged (and in some states required) to log purchases with the online database Project STOP.

As a result, some pharmacies no longer stock Sudafed, the common brand of pseudoephedrine cold/sinus tablets, opting instead to sell Sudafed PE, a phenylephrine product that has not been proven effective in clinical trials.

====Belgium====
Until 2024, several formulations of pseudoephedrine were available over-the-counter in Belgium. However, new legislation came into effect in November 2024, banning the over-the-counter sale of all medicines containing pseudoephedrine.

====Canada====
Health Canada has investigated the risks and benefits of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine/Ephedra. Near the end of the study, Health Canada issued a warning on their website stating that those who are under the age of 12, or who have heart disease and may have strokes, should avoid taking pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. Also, they warned that everyone should avoid taking ephedrine or pseudoephedrine with other stimulants like caffeine. They also banned all products that contain both ephedrine (or pseudoephedrine) and caffeine.

Products whose only medicinal ingredient is pseudoephedrine must be kept behind the pharmacy counter. Products containing pseudoephedrine along with other medicinal ingredients may be displayed on store shelves but may be sold only in a pharmacy when a pharmacist is present.

====Colombia====
The Colombian government prohibited the trade of pseudoephedrine in 2010.

====Estonia====
Pseudoephedrine is an over-the-counter drug in Estonia.

====Finland====
Pseudoephedrine medicines can only be obtained with a prescription in Finland.

====France====
Pseudoephedrine-containing combination products are available over the counter from pharmacies, most commonly with Paracetamol under the brand name &quot;Dolihrume&quot;. Products combining pseudoephedrine and ibuprofen or certain antihistamines are also available. However, products containing pseudoephedrine as a single ingredient are not sold. In October 2023, the French health department officially warned against the usage of pseudoephedrine for patients with a cold. It also suggested the substance&#x27;s availability could be restricted in the future, pending its pharmaceutical re-evaluation on EU level.
In December 2024, the government announced pseudoephedrine medicines would henceforth only be obtainable with a prescription.

====Germany====
Various pseudoephedrine-containing products in combination with ibuprofen, aspirin, or antihistamines can be obtained without a prescription upon request at a pharmacy. Common names include Aspirin Complex, Reactine Duo, and RhinoPront. Products containing pseudoephedrine as a single ingredient are not available.

====Japan====
Medications that contain more than 10% pseudoephedrine are prohibited under the Stimulants Control Law in Japan.

====Mexico====
On 23 November 2007, the use and trade of pseudoephedrine in Mexico was made illegal as it was argued that it was extremely popular as a precursor in the synthesis of methamphetamine.

====Netherlands====
Pseudoephedrine was withdrawn from sale in 1989 due to concerns about adverse cardiac side effects.

====New Zealand====
Since April 2024, pseudoephedrine has been classified as a restricted (pharmacist-only) drug in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 which allows the purchase of medicines containing pseudoephedrine from a pharmacist without a prescription.

Pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and any product containing these substances, e.g. cold and flu medicines, were first classified in October 2004 as Class C Part III (partially exempted) controlled drugs, due to being the principal ingredient in methamphetamine. New Zealand Customs and police officers continued to make large interceptions of precursor substances believed to be destined for methamphetamine production. On 9 October 2009, Prime Minister John Key announced pseudoephedrine-based cold and flu tablets would become prescription-only drugs and reclassified as a class B2 drug. The law was amended by The Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill 2010, which passed in August 2011.

On 24 November 2023, the recently formed National-led coalition government announced that the sale of cold medication containing pseudoephedrine would be allowed (as part of the coalition agreement between the National and ACT parties).

====Switzerland====
Pseudoephedrine is available without a prescription in combination (with aspirin) under the brand name &quot;Aspirin Complex&quot;. There is also a preparation consisting of a single ingredient 120 mg extended-release tablet that can be obtained at pharmacies with a prescription or after consultation with a pharmacist.

====Turkey====
In Turkey, medications containing pseudoephedrine are available by prescription only.

====United Kingdom====
In the UK, pseudoephedrine is available over the counter under the supervision of a qualified pharmacist, or on prescription. In 2007, the MHRA reacted to concerns over the diversion of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine by introducing voluntary restrictions limiting over-the-counter sales to one box containing no more than 720 mg of pseudoephedrine in total per transaction. These restrictions became law in April 2008. No form of ID is required.

====United States====
=====Federal=====
The United States Congress has recognized that pseudoephedrine is used in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine. In 2005, the Committee on Education and the Workforce heard testimony concerning education programs and state legislation designed to curb this illegal practice.

Attempts to control the sale of the drug date back to 1986, when federal officials at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) first drafted legislation, later proposed by Senator Bob Dole, that would have placed several chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. The bill would have required each transaction involving pseudoephedrine to be reported to the government, and federal approval of all imports and exports. Fearing this would limit legitimate use of the drug, lobbyists from over the counter drug manufacturing associations sought to stop this legislation from moving forward and were successful in exempting from the regulations all chemicals that had been turned into a legal final product, such as Sudafed.

Before the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, sales of the drug became increasingly regulated, as DEA regulators and pharmaceutical companies continued to fight for their respective positions. The DEA continued to make greater progress in its attempts to control pseudoephedrine as methamphetamine production skyrocketed, becoming a serious problem in the western United States. When purity dropped, so did the number of people in rehab and people admitted to emergency rooms with methamphetamine in their systems. This reduction in purity was usually short-lived, however, as methamphetamine producers eventually found a way around the new regulations.

Congress passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 (CMEA) as an amendment to the renewal of the USA Patriot Act. Signed into law by President George W. Bush on 6 March 2006, the act amended , concerning the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. The law mandated two phases, the first needing to be implemented by 8 April 2006, and the second to be completed by 30 September 2006. The first phase dealt primarily with implementing the new buying restrictions based on the amount, while the second phase encompassed the requirements of storage, employee training, and record keeping. Though the law was mainly directed at pseudoephedrine products it also applies to all over-the-counter products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, their salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical isomers.
Pseudoephedrine was defined as a &quot;scheduled listed chemical product&quot; under (45(A)). The act included the following requirements for merchants (&quot;regulated sellers&quot;) who sell such products:

* Required a retrievable record of all purchases, identifying the name and address of each party, to be kept for two years
* Required verification of proof of identity of all purchasers
* Required protection and disclosure methods in the collection of personal information
* Required reports to the Attorney General of any suspicious payments or disappearances of the regulated products
* Required training of employees with regard to the requirements of the CMEA. Retailers must self-certify as to training and compliance.
* The non-liquid dose form of regulated products may only be sold in unit dose blister packs
* Regulated products must be stored behind the counter or in a locked cabinet in such a way as to restrict public access
* Sales limits (per customer):
** Daily sales limit—must not exceed 3.6 grams of pseudoephedrine base without regard to the number of transactions
** 30-day (not monthly) sales limit—must not exceed 7.5 grams of pseudoephedrine base if sold by mail order or &quot;mobile retail vendor&quot;
** 30-day purchase limit—must not exceed 9 grams of pseudoephedrine base. (A misdemeanor possession offense under for the person who buys it.)

The requirements were revised in the Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act of 2008 to require that a regulated seller of scheduled listed chemical products may not sell such a product unless the purchaser:
* Presents a government-issued photographic identification; and
* Signs the written logbook with name, address, and time and date of the sale

=====State=====
Most states also have laws regulating pseudoephedrine.

The states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii () Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana (), Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have laws requiring pharmacies to sell pseudoephedrine &quot;behind the counter&quot;. Though the drug can be purchased without a prescription, states can limit the number of units sold and can collect personal information from purchasers.&quot;

The states of Oregon and Mississippi previously required a prescription for the purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine. However, as of 1 January 2022, these restrictions have been repealed. The state of Oregon reduced the number of methamphetamine lab seizures from 448 in 2004 (the final full year before implementation of the prescription only law) to a new low of 13 in 2009. The decrease in meth lab incidents in Oregon occurred largely before the prescription-only law took effect, according to a NAMSDL report titled &quot;Pseudoephedrine Prescription Laws in Oregon and Mississippi&quot;. The report posits that the decline in meth lab incidents in both states may be due to other factors: &quot;Mexican traffickers may have contributed to the decline in meth labs in Mississippi and Oregon (and surrounding states) as they were able to provide ample supply of equal or greater quality meth at competitive prices&quot;. Additionally, similar decreases in meth lab incidents were seen in surrounding states, according to the report, and meth-related deaths in Oregon have dramatically risen since 2007. Some municipalities in Missouri have enacted similar ordinances, including Washington, Union, New Haven, Cape Girardeau and Ozark. Certain pharmacies in Terre Haute, Indiana do so as well.

Another approach to controlling the drug on the state level mandated by some state governments to control the purchases of their citizens is the use of electronic tracking systems, which require the electronic submission of specified purchaser information by all retailers who sell pseudoephedrine. Thirty-two states now require the National Precursor Log Exchange (NPLEx) to be used for every pseudoephedrine and ephedrine OTC purchase, and ten of the eleven largest pharmacy chains in the US voluntarily contribute all of their similar transactions to NPLEx. These states have seen dramatic results in reducing the number of methamphetamine laboratory seizures. Before the implementation of the system in Tennessee in 2005, methamphetamine laboratory seizures totaled 1,497 in 2004 but were reduced to 955 in 2005, and 589 in 2009. Kentucky&#x27;s program was implemented statewide in 2008, and since statewide implementation, the number of laboratory seizures has significantly decreased. Oklahoma initially experienced success with its tracking system after implementation in 2006, as the number of seizures dropped in that year and again in 2007. In 2008, however, seizures began rising again, and have continued to rise in 2009.

NPLEx appears to be successful by requiring the real-time submission of transactions, thereby enabling the relevant laws to be enforced at the point of sale. By creating a multi-state database and the ability to compare all transactions quickly, NPLEx enables pharmacies to deny purchases that would be illegal based on gram limits, age, or even to convicted meth offenders in some states. NPLEx also enforces the federal gram limits across state lines, which was impossible with state-operated systems. Access to the records is by law enforcement agencies only, through an online secure portal.

==Research==
Pseudoephedrine has been studied in the treatment of snoring. However, data are inadequate to support this use.

<text>Ticker is a 2001 American action film directed by Albert Pyun and starring Tom Sizemore, Jaime Pressly, Dennis Hopper, Steven Seagal, Ice-T, Kevin Gage, and Nas.

==Plot==
A SWAT team converges on the house of a United States Senator, who is being held hostage. The bomb squad arrives; Frank Glass (Steven Seagal) finds a bomb in the basement and works to disarm it while the SWAT team is in a shootout with the hostage takers. Glass disarms the bomb but deems it too easy, believing it was designed to mislead him. The real bomb detonates, killing everyone inside.

A year later in San Francisco, narcotics cops Ray Nettles (Tom Sizemore) and partner Art &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Rice (Nas) arrest a suspect on drug charges. Ray lets a woman go who pleads for her and her child; Fuzzy tells Ray to get some help for his &quot;demons&quot; - he has never mourned the car bombing death of his wife and son. They see people entering a warehouse late at night and investigate. Ray apprehends a woman and three men converge on him; Fuzzy is shot by their leader (Dennis Hopper) and the three men flee. Ray arrests the woman, Claire (Jaime Pressly), but she refuses to say anything about the men. She is wearing an odd-looking bracelet which Nettles takes to the bomb squad for Glass to look over. The bracelet is found to contain detonation cord and Semtex explosive. The leader tells the police they have one hour to release Claire; when they do not, he bombs a bar.

Ray takes Glass back to the warehouse where they find a French cigarette and matchbook from a jazz club. They go to the club and kill one of the bombers, disarming his bomb. Ray questions Claire again; she reveals the bomber&#x27;s names - Alex Swan, the leader, and Vershbow, the surviving member. She claims that no matter what happens, she will be killed for getting caught, and has decided to cooperate. Swan intends to plant a bomb at the police station, but Vershbow gets cold feet and forces Swan to give him the bomb at gunpoint. The police corner him and Glass apparently prevents the detonation, but Swan detonates several more bombs using a pay phone.

Swan arranges a massive bombing with a crew led by Vincent Cruichshank (Ice-T). Ray convinces the police to release Claire, hoping to avert another bombing, and they give her a tracking device. Once she meets up with Swan, however, she disables the tracker and works with him. They discuss their upcoming &quot;masterpiece,&quot; and Claire goes to a phone booth to activate the bomb. She detonates a car bomb in Swan&#x27;s car, instead. Confused, Glass tells Ray they must both be dead. Seeing City Hall on TV, Ray remembers Claire&#x27;s story about her husband and realizes she was the mastermind all along. They rush to City Hall and split up - Ray goes to the basement and Glass to the roof. Ray is forced to disarm a bomb with advice over the radio from Glass, who coaches him to relax and forget his grief, but the device is a decoy. Glass disarms the real bomb on the roof.

<doc id="67442" wikidata="Q1383916" url="?curid=67442" title="Exit Wounds">
<text>Exit Wounds is a 2001 American action comedy film directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak, produced by Joel Silver, and starring Steven Seagal, DMX, Isaiah Washington, Anthony Anderson, Michael Jai White, Bill Duke, Tom Arnold and Jill Hennessy. Seagal plays Orin Boyd, a Detroit police detective notorious for pushing the limits of the law in his quest for justice. The screenplay is based on a novel of the same name by John Westermann.

This is the second of three films directed by Bartkowiak and produced by Silver that focus on martial arts-based action in an urban setting with a hip-hop soundtrack, following &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; (2000) and preceding &quot;Cradle 2 the Grave&quot; (2003). The three films feature many of the same cast, key crew, and locations.

The film received mixed reviews from critics. It earned $19 million in its opening weekend, and went on to gross a worldwide total of $79.9 million against a budget of $33 million. &quot;Exit Wounds&quot; was the final film under Steven Seagal&#x27;s exclusive contract with Warner Bros.

==Plot==

Detroit Police Department&#x27;s detective Orin Boyd is a cop in Detroit&#x27;s 21st precinct, who saves the Vice President of the United States from a right-wing militant group trying to kill him. Because he disobeyed orders, however, Captain Frank Daniels transfers Boyd to the 15th precinct — the city&#x27;s worst.

Boyd&#x27;s new captain, former internal affairs officer Annette Mulcahy, knows of his reputation, and she tells him that she will not tolerate insubordination. Annette sends Boyd to an anger management class where he meets Henry Wayne, the high-strung host of a local talk show called &quot;Detroit AM&quot;. Boyd comes across local drug dealer Latrell Walker and his fast-talking sidekick T.K. Johnson doing a shady deal with a man named Matt Montini. After a brief fight, Boyd discovers that Montini has been working undercover trying to nail Walker and Boyd ruined the sting, and that does not sit well with Montini&#x27;s musclebound partner Useldinger.

Sergeant Lewis Strutt steps in to cool things down when Boyd gets in a fight with Useldinger. After Boyd stumbles upon the theft of $5,000,000 worth of heroin from evidence storage, Boyd and new partner George Clark begin focusing their efforts on Walker and T.K. Intrigued by what little they have on Walker, they investigate why he has been visiting Shaun Rollins. Henry discovers that Walker is not a drug dealer, but a computer expert and billionaire whose real name is Leon Rollins, Shaun Rollins&#x27; brother. After an attempt on his life, Boyd confronts Leon, who explains that a group of corrupt cops needed a fall guy for a deal gone bad and pinned it on Shaun. It is further revealed that Strutt is the leader of the group, which also includes Montini and Useldinger. Leon and his friend Trish have been videotaping the activities of Strutt&#x27;s gang, hoping that it might help prove Shaun&#x27;s innocence and get him out of jail.

Boyd meets Mulcahy at a parking lot and to inform her what he has uncovered. Montini, Useldinger, and some other men try to kill Boyd and Annette. Mulcahy is killed in the chase and Boyd escapes. Boyd calls Frank and tells him that Strutt will be having a meeting at a warehouse in about an hour, to sell the heroin that was stolen. Strutt plans to try to sell it to Leon and T. K., not knowing that Leon is working against him. Frank promises that he will be there with some backup.

Boyd and Daniels show up, but Strutt tells Frank to keep Boyd under control. Boyd realizes that it is Frank who is behind everything. Clark blows open the door and barges in with backup, including police chief Hinges. Useldinger shoots Boyd and as he is about to shoot him again, while Clark shoots Useldinger dead. Chief Hinges kills Frank by shooting him four times with a shotgun. After a fight with Boyd, Strutt grabs a case full of money and runs up to the roof, where a helicopter is waiting. Montini gets the upper hand in his fight with Leon after he damages Leon&#x27;s vision with indigo fabric dye. Leon manages to stab Montini in the leg with a piece of broken glass, before killing him by having his neck impaled on a clothes rack. As the helicopter ladder is dragging Boyd across the roof with Strutt hanging on to the ladder, Boyd hooks the ladder to the roof; Strutt falls and is impaled on a metal pipe.

At dawn, Leon gives Hinges the videotape that proves the corruption, hoping that the tape will help prove Shaun&#x27;s innocence. Hinges does not believe the courts will care about the tape, so he had Shaun released from county jail about an hour before. Boyd decides to stay with the 15th precinct with George as his partner, and T.K. becomes Henry&#x27;s television co-host.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film is based on the book of the same name by John Westermann. The book is set in Long Island, New York, but the film moves the setting to Detroit. Seagal signed on to the film under a pay-or-play deal.

Filming took place in Toronto, Ontario; Hamilton, Ontario and the Centre Street Bridge in Calgary, Alberta. The club scene inside was filmed at Guvernment nightclub in Toronto. The exterior of the club was outside of Tonic nightclub in Toronto.

The film reunites actors DMX, Isaiah Washington, and Anthony Anderson with Polish film director Andrzej Bartkowiak, with whom they first worked together on the earlier 2000 film &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;. It is the second of three films directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak and produced by Joel Silver that focus on martial arts based action in an urban setting with a hip-hop soundtrack and featuring many of the same cast. Two years later they collaborated again on the film &quot;Cradle 2 the Grave&quot;.

Eva Mendes&#x27; voice was dubbed over by another, unidentified actress without her prior knowledge, as producers felt Mendes didn&#x27;t sound &quot;intelligent enough&quot;.

Dion Lam was the film&#x27;s martial arts choreographer.

===Accident on set===
Stuntman Chris Lamon died of head injuries on August 23, 2000, six days after a stunt went wrong on the &quot;Exit Wounds&quot; set in Hamilton, Ontario. A van was being towed along a street upside-down as part of a chase scene; he was supposed to roll safely out, but apparently struck his head. Another stuntman suffered a concussion in the same incident.

==Music==

A soundtrack containing hip hop music was released on March 20, 2001 by Virgin Records. It peaked at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #5 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Exit Wounds&quot; debuted at number one at the box office, grossing $19 million at North American theaters from Friday through Sunday. It was considered a surprise hit movie, as it grossed over $50 million in America and almost $30 million throughout the rest of the world. It was hailed as Seagal&#x27;s big &quot;comeback&quot;.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 32% based on 65 reviews. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;It probably goes without saying that &quot;Exit Wounds&quot; is loaded with plotholes and bad dialogue.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 39 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Lawrence Van Gelder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film 3 out of 5 and wrote: &quot;For those in search of action-filled escapist entertainment who are willing to jettison expectations of credibility into the nearest popcorn tub, Exit Wounds ... will do to pass time on an inclement day.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;In its low grade way, this blithely brutal cops and drugs thriller is an efficient hot wire entertainment.&quot; Gleiberman singled out Jill Hennessy for praise, saying that she &quot;takes the minor character of Seagal&#x27;s precinct commander and invests her with an intelligence and a flirty warm panache that sparkles on screen.&quot;

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety magazine&quot; gave the film a negative review, particularly Seagal&#x27;s performance saying he &quot;makes one wonder how he ever managed to be regarded as anything resembling a movie star.&quot; McCarthy complained that the action scenes were &quot;routine and unimaginative&quot; lacking the flair director Bartkowiak had shown in &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;. McCarthy was also critical of unconvincing use of easily recognizable Toronto locations as a stand in for Detroit.
Jonathan Foreman of &quot;The New York Post&quot; suggests that Barkowiak was trying to make a John Woo movie but simply did not have the skills. Foreman called the screenplay &quot;embarrassingly clunky and inane&quot;. He concludes, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to know which is more offensive, &quot;Exit Wounds&#x27;&quot; ineptitude or its disgusting, cynical brutality. But the people responsible for it are crass and shameless.&quot;

<text>Half Past Dead is a 2002 American action film written and directed by Don Michael Paul in his directorial debut. The film was produced by Elie Samaha, Andrew Stevens, and Steven Seagal, who also starred in the lead role. The film co-stars Morris Chestnut, Ja Rule, Tony Plana, Kurupt, and Nia Peeples. It tells the story of a criminal who infiltrates a prison to interrogate a prisoner about the location of a fortune in gold while an undercover FBI agent has to stop him. Distribution and copyrights were held by Columbia Pictures. &quot;Half Past Dead&quot; was released in the United States on November 15, 2002, by Screen Gems. The film garnered negative reviews from critics, and only grossed $19 million worldwide against its $25 million production budget. &quot;Half Past Dead&quot; was Steven Seagal&#x27;s last widely released film before he shifted to several direct-to-video films in many years until 2010.

==Plot==
In San Francisco, FBI agent Sasha Petrosevitch goes undercover as a Russian car thief and is brought in by criminal Nick Frazier to work for crime boss Sonny Eckvall, who apparently shot and killed Sasha&#x27;s wife. After some time, FBI Special Agent Ellen Williams and her team show up to nail Nick, but things go wrong, and Sasha gets shot.

After eight months of recovery following his brief bout of being clinically dead from the shooting, Sasha is incarcerated along with Nick in the newly reopened Alcatraz prison. Run by the charismatic warden, Juan Ruiz &quot;El Fuego&quot; Escarzaga, the place is known for its new state of the art death chamber where the condemned can choose from five different ways to die: lethal injection, gas chamber, hanging, firing squad, or electric chair.

Lester McKenna is the first death row prisoner brought to the new Alcatraz and also the first prisoner scheduled to be executed. An older man, he stole $200,000,000 worth of gold bricks in a heist that resulted in five deaths and hid the loot at an unknown location. Federal Bureau of Prisons head Frank Hubbard and Supreme Court Justice Jane McPherson have arrived to witness the execution, which is a result of Jane sentencing Lester.

But she&#x27;s not the only one interested in Lester. A small but well-equipped team of terrorists who call themselves the &quot;49ers&quot; have parachuted onto the Alcatraz island and gained control of it. Led by 49er One, a.k.a. Hubbard&#x27;s assistant Donny Johnson, and 49er Six, the team finds Lester, and they want him to give up the location of his hidden stash of gold. When Lester will not tell them, Donny shoots a nearby priest and threatens to kill others if the information is not delivered.

Donny&#x27;s plan is disrupted, however, when Sascha decides to step in and fight back. At this point, Sasha&#x27;s true identity is revealed and he used Nick to get to Sonny Eckvall, whom he seeks revenge on for the death of his wife. When Sasha rescues Lester, the 49ers strap Jane to the electric chair and threaten to kill her, all while Ellen and her team prepare a rescue plan from the mainland.

With the help of Nick and some of the other inmates such as Twitch and Little Joe, Sasha sets out to rescue Jane and bring Donny down, before Alcatraz becomes everyone&#x27;s final resting place. The conflict culminates in the 49ers taking McPherson and Lester on a helicopter and departing with Sascha in pursuit. Donny attempts to buy time by throwing MacPherson out of the helicopter, but Sascha dives after her and manages to save her, while Lester reveals that he was previously given an improvised bomb vest of grenades that he sets off, killing himself and Donny. Sasha subsequently leads the investigators to the gold, Lester having told him its location before his death.

A month later, Nick, having previously learnt of Sasha&#x27;s reasons for hunting Donny, is still recovering in prison, but is informed in a meeting with Sasha that he is being released early for his role in the hostage crisis.

<text>Baruch Kopel Goldstein (; born Benjamin Carl Goldstein; December 9, 1956 – February 25, 1994) was an American-Israeli physician and religious extremist who, in 1994, murdered 29 Palestinian people in Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, an incident of Jewish terrorism. Goldstein was a supporter of Kach, a religious Zionist party that the United States, the European Union and other countries designate as a terrorist organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;eu-2009/67/CFSP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Kach was banned less than a month after Goldstein&#x27;s attacks on account of statements made in support of his actions.

Born in 1956 in Brooklyn, New York, to an Orthodox Jewish family, Goldstein received his education there, starting with Jewish scripture studies, and eventually studying medicine at Yeshiva University. In the United States, he was a member of the Jewish Defense League (JDL), a militant Jewish organization founded by his boyhood acquaintance Meir Kahane. In 1983, Goldstein immigrated to Israel, and served as a physician in the Israeli military, during which he refused to treat Arabs, including those serving as soldiers. Later, he worked as a physician, and lived in the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Goldstein was active in Kahane&#x27;s Kach party, and was third on the party list for the Knesset during the 1984 elections. 

On February 25, 1994, Goldstein dressed in an Israeli military uniform, entered a mosque in the Cave of the Patriarchs and opened fire on the 800 Palestinian Muslim worshippers praying there during the month of Ramadan, killing 29 and wounding 125 worshippers, until he was beaten to death by survivors.

Goldstein&#x27;s gravesite became a pilgrimage site for Jewish extremists. The following words are inscribed on the tomb: &quot;He gave his life for the people of Israel, its Torah and land.&quot; In 1999, after the passing of Israeli legislation outlawing monuments to terrorists, the Israeli Army dismantled the shrine that had been built to Goldstein at the site of his interment. The tombstone and its epitaph, calling Goldstein a martyr with clean hands and a pure heart, was left untouched. After the flagstones around it were pried away under the eye of a military chaplain, the ground was covered with gravel.

==Early life and education==
Goldstein was born on December 9, 1956, as Benjamin Goldstein in Brooklyn, New York, to an Orthodox Jewish family. He attended the Yeshiva of Flatbush religious day school. He studied medicine at Yeshiva University, receiving a medical degree from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He belonged to the Jewish Defense League (JDL), a militant Jewish organization founded by his boyhood acquaintance Meir Kahane.

==Immigration to Israel==
Goldstein immigrated to Israel in 1983. He served as a physician in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), first as a conscript, then in the reserve forces. Following the end of his active duty, Goldstein worked as a physician, and lived in the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron, where he worked as an emergency doctor, and was involved in treating victims of Arab-Israeli violence. He changed his name from Benjamin to Baruch, married a Soviet immigrant named Miriam, and had four children. Israeli press reports claimed that Goldstein refused to treat Arabs, even Arab soldiers serving in the IDF, believing it was against Jewish laws to treat non-Jews even for payment. This was also reflected in comments by his acquaintances. Goldstein was active in Kahane&#x27;s Kach party, and was third on the party list for the Knesset during the 1984 elections.
He compared Israel&#x27;s democracy to the Nazi regime, and often wore a yellow star with the word &quot;JUDE&quot; on it.

==Massacre==

On February 25, 1994, that year&#x27;s Purim day, Goldstein entered a room in the Cave of the Patriarchs that was serving as a mosque, wearing an Israeli army uniform &quot;with the insignia of rank, creating the image of a reserve officer on active duty&quot;. He then opened fire, killing 29 worshippers and wounding more than 125. Mosque guard Mohammad Suleiman Abu Saleh said he thought that Goldstein was trying to kill as many people as possible, and described how there were &quot;bodies and blood everywhere&quot;. Eventually, Goldstein was overcome and beaten to death by survivors of the massacre. According to Ian Lustick, &quot;By mowing down Arabs he believed wanted to kill Jews, Goldstein was re-enacting part of the Purim story.&quot;

Palestinian protests and riots immediately followed the shooting; in the following week, twenty-five Palestinians were killed (by the Israel Defense Forces), as well as five Israelis. Following the riots, the Israeli government imposed a two-week curfew on the 120,000 Palestinian residents of Hebron. The 400 Jewish settlers of H2 were free to move around. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin telephoned Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat, and described the attack as a &quot;loathsome, criminal act of murder&quot;. In an address to the Knesset, Rabin, addressing not just Goldstein and his legacy but also other militant settlers, stated: 
&quot;You are not part of the community of Israel ... You are not part of the national democratic camp which we all belong to in this house, and many of the people despise you. You are not partners in the Zionist enterprise. You are a foreign implant. You are an errant weed. Sensible Judaism spits you out. You placed yourself outside the wall of Jewish law ... We say to this horrible man and those like him: you are a shame on Zionism and an embarrassment to Judaism.&quot;
The Israeli government condemned the massacre, and responded by arresting followers of Meir Kahane, forbidding certain settlers from entering Arab towns, and demanding that those settlers turn in their army-issued rifles, though rejecting a PLO demand that settlers be disarmed and that an international force be created to protect Palestinians. Goldstein was immediately &quot;denounced with shocked horror even by the mainstream Orthodox&quot;, and many in Israel classified Goldstein as insane.

==Gravesite and shrine==
Israeli military authorities refused to allow Goldstein to be buried in the Jewish cemetery in Hebron. He was buried opposite the Meir Kahane Memorial Park in Kiryat Arba, a Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron. The park is named in memory of Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the Israeli far-right political party Kach, a group classified by the United States and Israeli governments as a terrorist group. Goldstein was a long-time devotee of Kahane.

The gravesite has become a pilgrimage site for Jewish extremists; a plaque near the grave reads, &quot;To the holy Baruch Goldstein, who gave his life for the Jewish people, the Torah, and the nation of Israel&quot;. According to Baruch Marzel, about 10,000 people had visited the grave by the year 2000. In 1996, members of the Labor Party called for the shrine-like landscaped prayer area near the grave to be removed, and Israeli security officials expressed concern that the grave would encourage extremists. In 1999, following passage of a law designed to prohibit monuments to terrorists, and an associated Supreme Court ruling, the Israeli Army bulldozed the shrine and prayer area set up near Goldstein&#x27;s grave. As of 2014, a new tomb has been built, and still receives visits from Jewish pilgrims.

==Veneration by extremists==

While mainstream Jewish religious leaders, including the chief rabbis of Israel, rejected the suggestion that killing Palestinians was authorized by the Torah, some extremist religious Jews have defended Goldstein&#x27;s actions.

At Goldstein&#x27;s funeral, Rabbi Yaacov Perrin claimed that even one million Arabs are &quot;not worth a Jewish fingernail&quot;. Samuel Hacohen, a teacher at a Jerusalem college, declared Goldstein the &quot;greatest Jew alive, not in one way, but in every way&quot;, and said that he was &quot;the only one who could do it, the only one who was 100 percent perfect&quot;. Rabbi Dov Lior of Kiryat Arba declared that Goldstein was &quot;holier than all the martyrs of the Holocaust&quot;.

In the weeks following the massacre, hundreds of Israelis traveled to Goldstein&#x27;s grave to celebrate Goldstein&#x27;s actions. Some Hasidim danced and sang around his grave. According to one visitor to the gravesite in the wake of the attacks, &quot;If [Goldstein] stopped these so-called peace talks, then he is truly holy because this is not real peace.&quot; Some visitors declared Goldstein a &quot;saint&quot; and &quot;hero of Israel&quot;.

The phenomenon of the veneration of Goldstein&#x27;s tomb persisted for years. Even after the dismantling of Goldstein&#x27;s shrine in 1999, radical Jewish settlers continued to celebrate the anniversary of the massacre in the West Bank, sometimes even dressing up themselves or their children to look like Goldstein.

In 2010, Jewish settlers sang songs in praise of Baruch Goldstein&#x27;s massacre demonstratively in front of their Arab neighbours, during celebrations of Purim. A phrase from one song reads, &quot;Dr. Goldstein, there is none other like you in the world. Dr. Goldstein, we all love you ... He aimed at terrorists&#x27; heads, squeezed the trigger hard, and shot bullets, and shot, and shot.&quot;

Prior to entering the Knesset, Otzma Yehudit party leader and current Israeli Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir displayed a portrait of Goldstein in his living room. It was removed when Ben-Gvir entered politics.

<doc id="67453" wikidata="Q12191" url="?curid=67453" title="Nantes">
<text>Nantes (, ; ; or ; ) is a city in the Loire-Atlantique department of France on the Loire, from the Atlantic coast. The city is the sixth largest in France, with a population of 320,732 in Nantes proper and a metropolitan area of nearly 1 million inhabitants (2020). With Saint-Nazaire, a seaport on the Loire estuary, Nantes forms one of the main north-western French metropolitan agglomerations.

It is the administrative seat of the Loire-Atlantique department and the Pays de la Loire region, one of 18 regions of France. Nantes belongs historically and culturally to Brittany, a former duchy and province, and its omission from the modern administrative region of Brittany is controversial.

Nantes was identified during classical antiquity as a port on the Loire. It was the seat of a bishopric at the end of the Roman era before it was captured by the Bretons in 851 with the help of Lambert II of Nantes. Although Nantes was the primary residence of the 15th-century dukes of Brittany, Rennes became the provincial capital after the 1532 union of Brittany and France. 

During the 17th century, after the establishment of the French colonial empire, Nantes gradually became the largest port in France and was responsible for nearly half of the 18th-century French Atlantic slave trade. The French Revolution resulted in an economic decline, but Nantes developed robust industries after 1850 (chiefly in shipbuilding and food processing). Deindustrialization in the second half of the 20th century spurred the city to adopt a service economy. 

In 2020, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked Nantes as a Gamma world city. It is the third-highest-ranking city in France, after Paris and Lyon. The Gamma category includes cities such as Algiers, Orlando, Porto, Turin and Leipzig. Nantes has been praised for its quality of life, and it received the European Green Capital Award in 2013. The European Commission noted the city&#x27;s efforts to reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions, its high-quality and well-managed public transport system and its biodiversity, with of green space and several protected Natura 2000 areas.

==Etymology==

Nantes is named after a tribe of Gaul, the Namnetes, who established a settlement between the end of the second century and the beginning of the first century BC on the north bank of the Loire near its with the Erdre. The origin of the name &quot;Namnetes&quot; is uncertain, but is thought to come from the Gaulish root *&quot;nant-&quot; &#x27;river, stream&#x27; (from the pre-Celtic root &quot;*nanto&quot; &#x27;valley&#x27;) or from &quot;Amnites&quot;, another tribal name possibly meaning &#x27;men of the river&#x27;.

Its first recorded name was by the Greek writer Ptolemy, who referred to the settlement as () and ()—which might be read as ()—in his treatise, &quot;Geography&quot;. The name was Latinised during the Gallo-Roman period as (the most common form), , and . Although its origins are unclear, seems to be related to the Gaulish word &#x27;confluence&#x27;.

The Namnete root of the city&#x27;s name was introduced at the end of the Roman period, when it became known as &quot;port of the Namnetes&quot; and &#x27;city of the Namnetes&#x27;. Like other cities in the region (including Paris), its name was replaced during the fourth century with a Gaulish one: Lutetia became Paris (city of the Parisii), and Darioritum became Vannes (city of the Veneti). Nantes&#x27;s name continued to evolve, becoming and during the fifth century and Nantes after the sixth, via syncope (suppression of the middle syllable).

===Modern pronunciation and nicknames===
&quot;Nantes&quot; is pronounced , and the city&#x27;s inhabitants are known as &quot;Nantais&quot; . In Gallo, the oïl language traditionally spoken in the region around Nantes, the city is spelled &quot;Naunnt&quot; or &quot;Nantt&quot; and pronounced identically to French, although northern speakers use a long . In Breton, Nantes is known as or , the latter of which is less common and reflects the more-frequent use of articles in Breton than in French ones.

Nantes&#x27;s historical nickname was &quot;Venice of the West&quot; (), a reference to the many quays and river channels in the old town before they were filled in during the 1920s and 1930s. The city is commonly known as &quot;the City of the Dukes [of Brittany]&quot; for its castle and former role as a ducal residence.

==History==
===Prehistory and antiquity===

The first inhabitants of what is now Nantes settled during the Bronze Age, later than in the surrounding regions (which have Neolithic monuments absent from Nantes). Its first inhabitants were apparently attracted by small iron and tin deposits in the region&#x27;s subsoil. The area exported tin, mined in Abbaretz and Piriac, as far as Ireland. After about 1,000 years of trading, local industry appeared around 900 BC; remnants of smithies dated to the eighth and seventh centuries BC have been found in the city. Nantes may have been the major Gaulish settlement of Corbilo, on the Loire estuary, which was mentioned by the Greek historians Strabo and Polybius.

Its history from the seventh century to the Roman conquest in the first century BC is poorly documented, and there is no evidence of a city in the area before the reign of Tiberius in the first century AD. During the Gaulish period it was the capital of the Namnetes people, who were allied with the Veneti in a territory extending to the northern bank of the Loire. Rivals in the area included the Pictones, who controlled the area south of the Loire in the city of Ratiatum (present-day Rezé) until the end of the second century AD. Ratiatum, founded under Augustus, developed more quickly than Nantes and was a major port in the region. Nantes began to grow when Ratiatum collapsed after the Germanic invasions.

Because tradesmen favoured inland roads rather than Atlantic routes, Nantes never became a large city under Roman occupation. Although it lacked amenities such as a theatre or an amphitheatre, the city had sewers, public baths and a temple dedicated to Mars Mullo. After an attack by German tribes in 275, Nantes&#x27;s inhabitants built a wall; this defense also became common in surrounding Gaulish towns. The wall in Nantes, enclosing , was one of the largest in Gaul.

Christianity was introduced during the third century. The first local martyrs (Donatian and Rogatian) were executed in 288–290, and a cathedral was built during the fourth century.

===Middle Ages===

Like much of the region, Nantes was part of the Roman Empire during the early Middle Ages. Although many parts of Brittany experienced significant Breton immigration (loosening ties to Rome), Nantes remained allied with the empire until its collapse in the fifth century. Around 490, the Franks under Clovis I captured the city (alongside eastern Brittany) from the Visigoths after a sixty-day siege; it was used as a stronghold against the Bretons. 

Under Charlemagne in the eighth century the town was the capital of the Breton March, a buffer zone protecting the Carolingian Empire from Breton invasion. The first governor of the Breton March was Roland, whose feats were mythologized in the body of literature known as the Matter of France. 

After Charlemagne&#x27;s death in 814, Breton armies invaded the March and fought the Franks. Nominoe (a Breton) became the first duke of Brittany, seizing Nantes in 850. Discord marked the first decades of Breton rule in Nantes as Breton lords fought among themselves, making the city vulnerable to Viking incursions. The most spectacular Viking attack in Nantes occurred in 843, when Viking warriors killed the bishop but did not settle in the city at that time. Nantes became part of the Viking realm in 919, but the Norse were expelled from the town in 937 by Alan II, Duke of Brittany.

Feudalism took hold in France during the 10th and 11th centuries, and Nantes was the seat of a county founded in the ninth century. Until the beginning of the 13th century, it was the subject of succession crises which saw the town pass several times from the Dukes of Brittany to the counts of Anjou (of the House of Plantagenet). During the 14th century, Brittany experienced a war of succession which ended with the accession of the House of Montfort to the ducal throne. The Montforts, seeking emancipation from the suzerainty of the French kings, reinforced Breton institutions. They chose Nantes, the largest town in Brittany (with a population of over 10,000), as their main residence and made it the home of their council, their treasury and their chancery. Port traffic, insignificant during the Middle Ages, became the city&#x27;s main activity. Nantes began to trade with foreign countries, exporting salt from Bourgneuf, wine, fabrics and hemp (usually to the British Isles). 

The 15th century is considered Nantes&#x27;s first golden age. The reign of Francis II saw many improvements to a city in dire need of repair after the wars of succession and a series of storms and fires between 1387 and 1415. Many buildings were built or rebuilt (including the cathedral and the castle), and the University of Nantes, the first in Brittany, was founded in 1460.

===Modern era===
The marriage of Anne of Brittany to Charles VIII of France in 1491 began the unification of the duchy of Brittany with the French crown which was ratified by Francis I of France in 1532. The union ended a long feudal conflict between France and Brittany, reasserting the king&#x27;s suzerainty over the Bretons. In return for surrendering its independence, Brittany retained its privileges. Although most Breton institutions were maintained, the unification favoured Rennes (the site of ducal coronations). Rennes received most legal and administrative institutions, and Nantes kept a financial role with its Chamber of Accounts. 

During the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598, the city was a Catholic League stronghold. The Duke of Mercœur, governor of Brittany, strongly opposed the succession of the Protestant Henry IV of France to the throne of France in 1589. The Duke created an independent government in Nantes, allying with Spain and pressing for independence from France. Despite initial successes with Spanish aid, in 1598 he submitted to Henry IV (who had by then converted to Catholicism); the Edict of Nantes (legalising Protestantism in France) was signed in the town, concluding the French wars of religion. Nonetheless, the town remained fervently Catholic (by contrast to nearby La Rochelle), and the local Protestant community did not number more than 1,000.

Coastal navigation and the export of locally produced goods (salt, wine and fabrics) dominated the local economy around 1600. During the mid-17th century, the siltation of local salterns and a fall in wine exports compelled Nantes to find other activities. Local shipowners began importing sugar from the French West Indies (Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue) in the 1640s, which became very profitable after protectionist reforms implemented by Jean-Baptiste Colbert prevented the import of sugar from Spanish colonies (which had dominated the market). 

In 1664 Nantes was France&#x27;s eighth-largest port, and it was the largest by 1700. Plantations in the colonies needed labour to produce sugar, rum, tobacco, indigo dye, coffee and cocoa, and Nantes shipowners began trading African slaves in 1706. The port was part of the triangular trade: ships went to West Africa to buy slaves, slaves were sold in the French West Indies, and the ships returned to Nantes with sugar and other exotic goods. From 1707 to 1793, Nantes was responsible for 42 percent of the French slave trade; its merchants sold about 450,000 African slaves in the West Indies.

Manufactured goods were more lucrative than raw materials during the 18th century. There were about fifteen sugar refineries in the city around 1750 and nine cotton mills in 1786. Nantes and its surrounding area were the main producers of French printed cotton fabric during the 18th century, and the Netherlands was the city&#x27;s largest client for exotic goods. Although trade brought wealth to Nantes, the city was confined by its walls; their removal during the 18th century allowed it to expand. Neoclassical squares and public buildings were constructed, and wealthy merchants built sumptuous &quot;hôtels particuliers&quot;.

===French Revolution===

The French Revolution initially received some support in Nantes, a bourgeois city rooted in private enterprise. On 18 July 1789, locals seized the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany in an imitation of the storming of the Bastille. Rural western France, Catholic and conservative, strongly opposed the abolition of the monarchy and the submission of the clergy. A rebellion in the neighbouring Vendée began in 1793, quickly spreading to surrounding regions. 

Nantes was an important Republican garrison on the Loire en route to England. On 29 June 1793, 30,000 Royalist troops from Vendée attacked the city on their way to Normandy (where they hoped to receive British support). Twelve thousand Republican soldiers resisted and the Battle of Nantes resulted in the death of Royalist leader Jacques Cathelineau. Three years later another Royalist leader, François de Charette, was executed in Nantes.

After the Battle of Nantes, the National Convention (which had founded the First French Republic) decided to purge the city of its anti-revolutionary elements. Nantes was seen by the convention as a corrupt merchant city; the local elite was less supportive of the French Revolution, since its growing centralisation reduced their influence. From October 1793 to February 1794, deputy Jean-Baptiste Carrier presided over a revolutionary tribunal notorious for cruelty and ruthlessness. Between 12,000 and 13,000 people (including women and children) were arrested, and 8,000 to 11,000 died of typhus or were executed by the guillotine, shooting or drowning. The Drownings at Nantes were intended to kill large numbers of people simultaneously, and Carrier called the Loire &quot;the national bathtub&quot;.

The French Revolution was disastrous for the local economy. The slave trade nearly disappeared because of the abolition of slavery and the independence of Saint-Domingue, and Napoleon&#x27;s Continental Blockade decimated trade with other European countries. Nantes never fully recovered its 18th-century wealth; the port handled 43,242 tons of goods in 1807, down from 237,716 tons in 1790.

===Industries===

Outlawed by the French Revolution, the slave trade re-established itself as Nantes&#x27;s major source of income in the first decades of the 19th century. It was the last French port to conduct the illegal Atlantic trade, continuing it until about 1827. The 19th-century slave trade may have been as extensive as that of the previous century, with about 400,000 slaves deported to the colonies. Businessmen took advantage of local vegetable production and Breton fishing to develop a canning industry during the 1820s, but canning was eclipsed by sugar imported from Réunion in the 1840s and 1850s. Nantes tradesmen received a tax rebate on Réunion sugar, which was lucrative until disease devastated the cane plantations in 1863. 

By the mid-19th century, Le Havre and Marseille were the two main French ports; the former traded with America and the latter with Asia. They had embraced the Industrial Revolution, thanks to Parisian investments; Nantes lagged behind, struggling to find profitable activities. Nostalgic for the pre-revolutionary golden age, the local elite had been suspicious of political and technological progress during the first half of the 19th century. In 1851, after much debate and opposition, Nantes was connected to Paris by the Tours–Saint-Nazaire railway.

Nantes became a major industrial city during the second half of the 19th century with the aid of several families who invested in successful businesses. In 1900, the city&#x27;s two main industries were food processing and shipbuilding. The former, primarily the canning industry, included the biscuit manufacturer LU and the latter was represented by three shipyards which were among the largest in France. These industries helped maintain port activity and facilitated agriculture, sugar imports, fertilizer production, machinery and metallurgy, which employed 12,000 people in Nantes and its surrounding area in 1914. Because large, modern ships had increased difficulty traversing the Loire to reach Nantes, a new port in Saint-Nazaire had been established at the mouth of the estuary in 1835. Saint-Nazaire, primarily developed for goods to be before being sent to Nantes, also built rival shipyards. Saint-Nazaire surpassed Nantes in port traffic for the first time in 1868. Reacting to the growth of the rival port, Nantes built a canal parallel to the Loire to remain accessible to large ships. The canal, completed in 1892, was abandoned in 1910 because of the efficient dredging of the Loire between 1903 and 1914.

===Land reclamation===

At the beginning of the 20th century, the river channels flowing through Nantes were increasingly perceived as hampering the city&#x27;s comfort and economic development. Sand siltation required dredging, which weakened the quays; one quay collapsed in 1924. Embankments were overcrowded with railways, roads and tramways. Between 1926 and 1946, most of the channels were filled in and their water diverted. Large thoroughfares replaced the channels, altering the urban landscape. Feydeau and Gloriette Islands in the old town were attached to the north bank, and the other islands in the Loire were formed into the Isle of Nantes.

When the land reclamation was almost complete, Nantes was shaken by the air raids of the Second World War. The city was captured by Nazi Germany on 18 June 1940, during the Battle of France. Forty-eight civilians were executed in Nantes in 1941 in retaliation for the assassination of German officer Karl Hotz. They are remembered as &quot;the 50 hostages&quot; because the Germans initially planned to kill 50 people. British bombs first hit the city in August 1941 and May 1942. The main attacks occurred on 16 and 23 September 1943, when most of Nantes&#x27;s industrial facilities and portions of the city centre and its surrounding area were destroyed by American bombs. About 20,000 people were left homeless by the 1943 raids, and 70,000 subsequently left the city. Allied raids killed 1,732 people and destroyed 2,000 buildings in Nantes, leaving a further 6,000 buildings unusable. The Germans abandoned the city on 12 August 1944, and it was recaptured without a fight by the French Forces of the Interior and the U.S. Army.

===Postwar===

The postwar years were a period of strikes and protests in Nantes. A strike organised by the city&#x27;s 17,500 metallurgists during the summer of 1955 to protest salary disparities between Paris and the rest of France deeply impacted the French political scene, and their action was echoed in other cities. Nantes saw other large strikes and demonstrations during the May 1968 events, when marches drew about 20,000 people into the streets. The 1970s global recession brought a large wave of deindustrialisation to France, and Nantes saw the closure of many factories and the city&#x27;s shipyards. The 1970s and 1980s were primarily a period of economic stagnation for Nantes. During the 1980s and 1990s its economy became service-oriented and it experienced economic growth under Jean-Marc Ayrault, the city&#x27;s mayor from 1989 to 2012. Under Ayrault&#x27;s administration, Nantes used its quality of life to attract service firms. The city developed a rich cultural life, advertising itself as a creative place near the ocean. Institutions and facilities (such as its airport) were re-branded as &quot;Nantes Atlantique&quot; to highlight this proximity. Local authorities have commemorated the legacy of the slave trade, promoting dialogue with other cultures.

Nantes has been noted in recent years for its climate of social unrest, marked by frequent and often violent clashes between protesters and police. Tear gas is frequently deployed during protests. The city has a significant ultra-left radical scene, owing in part to the proximity of the ZAD de Notre-Dame-des-Landes. Masked rioters have repeatedly ransacked shops, offices and public transport infrastructure. The death of Steve Maia Caniço in June 2019 has led to accusations of police brutality and cover-ups.

==Geography==

===Location===

Nantes is in northwestern France, near the Atlantic Ocean and southwest of Paris. Bordeaux, the other major metropolis of western France, is south. Nantes and Bordeaux share positions at the mouth of an estuary, and Nantes is on the Loire estuary.

The city is at a natural crossroads between the ocean in the west, the centre of France (towards Orléans) in the east, Brittany in the north and Vendée (on the way to Bordeaux) in the south. It is an architectural junction; northern French houses with slate roofs are north of the Loire, and Mediterranean dwellings with low terracotta roofs dominate the south bank. The Loire is also the northern limit of grape culture. 

Land north of Nantes is dominated by bocage and dedicated to polyculture and animal husbandry, and the south is renowned for its Muscadet vineyards and market gardens. The city is near the geographical centre of the land hemisphere, identified in 1945 by Samuel Boggs as near the main railway station (around ).

===Hydrology===

The Loire is about long and its estuary, beginning in Nantes, is in length. The river&#x27;s bed and banks have changed considerably over a period of centuries. In Nantes the Loire had divided into a number of channels, creating a dozen islands and sand ridges. They facilitated crossing the river, contributing to the city&#x27;s growth. Most of the islands were protected with levees during the modern era, and they disappeared in the 1920s and 1930s when the smallest waterways were filled in. The Loire in Nantes now has only two branches, one on either side of the Isle of Nantes.

The river is tidal in the city, and tides are observed about further east. The tidal range can reach in Nantes, larger than at the mouth of the estuary. This is the result of 20th-century dredging to make Nantes accessible by large ships; tides were originally much weaker. Nantes was at the point where the river current and the tides cancelled each other out, resulting in siltation and the formation of the original islands.

The city is at the confluence of two tributaries. The Erdre flows into the Loire from its north bank, and the Sèvre Nantaise flows into the Loire from its south bank. These two rivers initially provided natural links with the hinterland. When the channels of the Loire were filled, the Erdre was diverted in central Nantes and its confluence with the Loire was moved further east. The Erdre includes Versailles Island, which became a Japanese garden during the 1980s. It was created in the 19th century with fill from construction of the Nantes–Brest canal.

===Geology===

Nantes is built on the Armorican Massif, a range of weathered mountains which may be considered the backbone of Brittany. The mountains, stretching from the end of the Breton peninsula to the outskirts of the sedimentary Paris Basin, are composed of several parallel ridges of Ordovician and Cadomian rocks. Nantes is where one of these ridges, the Sillon de Bretagne, meets the Loire. It passes through the western end of the old town, forming a series of cliffs above the quays. The end of the ridge, the Butte Sainte-Anne, is a natural landmark above sea level; its foothills are at an elevation of .

The Sillon de Bretagne is composed of granite; the rest of the region is a series of low plateaus covered with silt and clay, with mica schist and sediments found in lower areas. Much of the old town and all of the Isle of Nantes consist of backfill. Elevations in Nantes are generally higher in the western neighbourhoods on the Sillon, reaching in the north-west. The Erdre flows through a slate fault. Eastern Nantes is flatter, with a few hills reaching . The city&#x27;s lowest points, along the Loire, are above sea level.

===Climate===
Nantes has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) influenced by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. West winds produced by cyclonic depressions in the Atlantic dominate, and north and north-west winds are also common. Slight variations in elevation make fog common in valleys, and slopes oriented south and south-west have good insolation. Winters are cool and rainy, with an average temperature of ; snow is rare. Summers are warm, with an average temperature of . Rain is abundant throughout the year, with an annual average of . The climate in Nantes is suitable for growing a variety of plants, from temperate vegetables to exotic trees and flowers imported during the colonial era.

===Urban layout===

Nantes&#x27;s layout is typical of French towns and cities. It has a historical centre with old monuments, administrative buildings and small shops, surrounded by 19th-century faubourgs surrounded by newer suburban houses and public housing. The city centre has a medieval core (corresponding to the former walled town) and 18th-century extensions running west and east. The northern extension, Marchix, was considered squalid and nearly disappeared during the 20th century. The old town did not extend south before the 19th century, since it would have meant building on the unsteady islands in the Loire.

The medieval core has narrow streets and a mixture of half-timbered buildings, more recent sandstone buildings, post-World War II reconstruction and modern redevelopment. It is primarily a student neighbourhood, with many bars and small shops. The eastern extension (behind Nantes Cathedral) was traditionally inhabited by the aristocracy, and the larger western extension along the Loire was built for the bourgeoisie. It is Nantes&#x27;s most-expensive area, with wide avenues, squares such as the Place Saint-Pierre and &quot;hôtels particuliers&quot;. The area was extended towards the Parc de Procé during the 19th century. The other faubourgs were built along the main boulevards and the plateaus, turning the valleys into parks. Outside central Nantes several villages, including Chantenay, Doulon, L&#x27;Eraudière and Saint-Joseph-de-Porterie, were absorbed by urbanisation.
After World War II, several housing projects were built to accommodate Nantes&#x27;s growing population. The oldest, Les Dervallières, was developed in 1956 and was followed by Bellevue in 1959 and Le Breil and Malakoff in 1971. Once areas of poverty, they are experiencing regeneration since the 2000s. The northern outskirts of the city, along the Erdre, include the main campus of the University of Nantes and other institutes of higher education. During the second half of the 20th century, Nantes expanded south into the communes of Rezé, Vertou and Saint-Sébastien-sur-Loire (across the Loire but near the city centre) and north-bank communes including Saint-Herblain, Orvault and Sainte-Luce-sur-Loire.

The Isle of Nantes is divided between former shipyards on the west, an old faubourg in its centre and modern housing estates on the east. Since the 2000s, it has been subject to the conversion of former industrial areas into office space, housing and leisure facilities. Local authorities intend to make it an extension of the city centre. Further development is also planned on the north bank along an axis linking the train station and the Loire.

===Parks and environment===

Nantes has 100 public parks, gardens and squares covering . The oldest is the Jardin des Plantes, a botanical garden created in 1807. It has a large collection of exotic plants, including a 200-year-old &quot;Magnolia grandiflora&quot; and the national collection of &quot;camellia&quot;. Other large parks include the Parc de Procé, Parc du Grand Blottereau and Parc de la Gaudinière, the former gardens of country houses built outside the old town. Natural areas, an additional , include the Petite Amazonie (a Natura 2000 protected forest) and several woods, meadows and marshes. Green space (public and private) makes up 41 percent of Nantes&#x27;s area.

The city adopted an ecological framework in 2007 to reduce greenhouse gases and promote energy transition. Nantes has three ecodistricts (one on the Isle of Nantes, one near the train station and the third in the north-east of the city), which aim to provide affordable, ecological housing and counter urban sprawl by redeveloping neglected areas of the city.

==Governance==

===Local government===

Nantes is the (capital city) of the Loire-Atlantique &quot;département&quot; and the Pays de la Loire . It is the residence of a and &quot;département&quot; &quot;prefect&quot;, local representatives of the French government. Nantes is also the meeting place of the and &quot;département&quot; councils, two elected political bodies.

The city is administered by a mayor and a council, elected every six years. The council has 65 councillors. It originated in 1410, when John V, Duke of Brittany created the Burghers&#x27;s Council. The assembly was controlled by wealthy merchants and the Lord Lieutenant. After the union of Brittany and France, the burghers petitioned the French king to give them a city council which would enhance their freedom; their request was granted by Francis II in 1559. The new council had a mayor, ten aldermen and a crown prosecutor. The first council was elected in 1565 with Nantes&#x27;s first mayor, Geoffroy Drouet. The present city council is a result of the French Revolution and a 4 December 1789 act. The current mayor of Nantes is Johanna Rolland (Socialist Party), who was elected on 4 April 2014. The party has held a majority since 1983, and Nantes has become a left-wing stronghold. The city council is based at the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall).

Since 1995, Nantes has been divided into 11 neighbourhoods (&quot;quartiers&quot;), each with an advisory committee and administrative agents. City-council members are appointed to each &quot;quartier&quot; to consult with the local committees. The neighbourhood committees, existing primarily to facilitate dialogue between citizens and the local government, meet twice a year.

Like most French municipalities, Nantes is part of an intercommunal structure which combines the city with 24 smaller, neighbouring communes. Called Nantes Métropole, it encompasses the city&#x27;s metropolitan area and had a population of 609,198 in 2013. Nantes Métropole administers urban planning, transport, public areas, waste disposal, energy, water, housing, higher education, economic development, employment and European topics. As a consequence, the city council&#x27;s mandates are security, primary and secondary education, early childhood, social aid, culture, sport and health. Nantes Métropole, created in 1999, is administered by a council consisting of the 97 members of the local municipal councils. According to an act passed in 2014, beginning in 2020, the metropolitan council will be elected by the citizens of Nantes Métropole. The council is currently overseen by Rolland.

===Heraldry===

Local authorities began using official symbols in the 14th century, when the provost commissioned a seal on which the Duke of Brittany stood on a boat and protected Nantes with his sword. The present coat of arms was first used in 1514; its ermines symbolise Brittany, and its green waves suggest the Loire.

Nantes&#x27;s coat of arms had ducal emblems before the French Revolution: the belt cord of the Order of the Cord (founded by Anne of Brittany) and the city&#x27;s coronet. The coronet was replaced by a mural crown during the 18th century, and during the revolution a new emblem with a statue of Liberty replaced the coat of arms. During Napoleon&#x27;s rule the coat of arms returned, with bees (a symbol of his empire) added to the chief. The original coat of arms was readopted in 1816, and the Liberation Cross and the 1939–45 War Cross were added in 1948.

Before the revolution, Nantes&#x27;s motto was &quot;Oculi omnium in te sperant, Domine&quot; (&quot;The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord&quot;, a line from a grace). It disappeared during the revolution, and the city adopted its current motto—&quot;Favet Neptunus eunti&quot; (&quot;Neptune favours the traveller&quot;)—in 1816. Nantes&#x27;s flag is derived from the naval jack flown by Breton vessels before the French Revolution. The flag has a white cross on a black one; its quarters have Breton ermines except for the upper left, which has the city&#x27;s coat of arms. The black and white crosses are historic symbols of Brittany and France, respectively.

===Nantes and Brittany===

Nantes and the Loire-Atlantique &quot;département&quot; were part of the historic province of Brittany, and the city and Rennes were its traditional capitals. In the 1789 replacement of the historic provinces of France, Brittany was divided among five &quot;départements&quot;. The administrative region of Brittany did not exist during the 19th and early 20th centuries, although its cultural heritage remained. Nantes and Rennes are in Upper Brittany (the Romance-speaking part of the region), and Lower Brittany in the west is traditionally Breton-speaking and more Celtic in culture. As a large port whose outskirts encompassed other provinces, Nantes has been Brittany&#x27;s economic capital and a cultural crossroads. Breton culture in Nantes is not necessarily characteristic of Lower Brittany&#x27;s, although the city experienced substantial Lower Breton immigration during the 19th century.

In the mid-20th century, several French governments considered creating a new level of local government by combining &quot;départements&quot; into larger regions. The regions, established by acts of parliament in 1955 and 1972, loosely follow the pre-revolutionary divisions and Brittany was revived as Region Brittany. Nantes and the Loire-Atlantique &quot;département&quot; were not included, because each new region centred on one metropolis. Region Brittany was created around Rennes, similar in size to Nantes; the Loire-Atlantique &quot;département&quot; formed a new region with four other &quot;départements&quot;, mainly portions of the old provinces of Anjou, Maine and Poitou. The new region was called Pays de la Loire (&quot;Loire Countries&quot;) although it does not include most of the Loire Valley. It has often been said that the separation of Nantes from the rest of Brittany was decided by Vichy France during the Second World War. Philippe Pétain created a new Brittany without Nantes in 1941, but his region disappeared after the liberation.

Debate continues about Nantes&#x27;s place in Brittany, with polls indicating a large majority in Loire-Atlantique and throughout the historic province favouring Breton reunification. In a 2014 poll, 67 percent of Breton people and 77 percent of Loire-Atlantique residents favoured reunification. Opponents, primarily Pays de la Loire officials, say that their region could not exist economically without Nantes. Pays de la Loire officials favour a union of Brittany with the Pays de la Loire, but Breton politicians oppose the incorporation of their region into a Greater West region. Nantes&#x27;s city council has acknowledged the fact that the city is culturally part of Brittany, but its position on reunification is similar to that of the Pays de la Loire. City officials tend to consider Nantes an open metropolis with its own personality, independent of surrounding regions.

==Population==

Nantes had 320,732 inhabitants in 2020, the largest population in its history. Although it was the largest city in Brittany during the Middle Ages, it was smaller than three other north-western towns: Angers, Tours and Caen. Nantes has experienced consistent growth since the Middle Ages, except during the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon I (when it experienced depopulation, primarily due to the Continental System). In 1500, the city had a population of around 14,000. Nantes&#x27;s population increased to 25,000 in 1600 and to 80,000 in 1793. In 1800 it was the sixth-largest French city, behind Paris (550,000), Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux and Rouen (all 80,000 to 109,000). Population growth continued through the 19th century; although other European cities experienced increased growth due to industrialisation, in Nantes growth remained at its 18th-century pace. Nantes reached the 100,000 mark about 1850, and 130,000 around 1900. In 1908 it annexed the neighbouring &quot;communes&quot; of Doulon and Chantenay, gaining almost 30,000 inhabitants. Population growth was slower during the 20th century, remaining under 260,000 from the 1960s to the 2000s primarily because urban growth spread to surrounding &quot;communes&quot;. Since 2000 the population of Nantes began to rise due to redevelopment, and its urban area has continued to experience population growth. The Nantes metropolitan area had a population of 907,995 in 2013, nearly doubling since the 1960s. Its population is projected to reach one million by 2030, based on the fertility rate.

The population of Nantes is younger than the national average, with 44.3 percent under age 29 (France 35.3 percent). People over age 60 account for 18.7 percent of the city&#x27;s population (France 26.4 percent). Single-person households are 53.1 percent of the total, and 16.4 percent of households are families with children. Young couples with children tend to move outside the city because of high property prices, and most newcomers are students (37 percent) and adults moving for professional reasons (49 percent). Students generally come from within the region, and working people are often from Paris. In 2020, the unemployment rate was 10.5 percent of the active population (France 9.5 percent, Loire-Atlantique 7.9 percent). The poorest council estates had unemployment rates of 22 to 47 percent. Of those employed, 59.5 percent were in intermediate or management positions, 24.1 percent were employees and 11.4 percent were workers in 2020. In 2020, 39.7 percent of the population over 15 had a higher-education degree and 12.9 percent had no diploma.

===Ethnicity and languages===
Nantes has long had ethnic minorities. Spanish, Portuguese and Italian communities were mentioned during the 16th century, and an Irish Jacobite community appeared a century later. However, immigration has always been lower in Nantes than in other large French cities. The city&#x27;s foreign population has been stable since 1990, half the average for other French cities of similar size. France does not have ethnic or religious categories in its census, but counts the number of people born in a foreign country. In 2013 this category had 24,949 people in Nantes, or 8.5 percent of the total population. The majority (60.8 percent) were 25 to 54 years old. Their primary countries of origin were Algeria (13.9 percent), Morocco (11.4 percent) and Tunisia (5.8 percent). Other African countries accounted for 24.9 percent, the European Union 15.6 percent, the rest of Europe 4.8 percent and Turkey 4.3 percent.

The city is part of the territory of the langues d&#x27;oïl, a dialect continuum which stretches across northern France and includes standard French. The local dialect in Nantes is Gallo, spoken by some in Upper Brittany. Nantes, as a large city, has been a stronghold of standard French. A local dialect (&quot;parler nantais&quot;) is sometimes mentioned by the press, but its existence is dubious and its vocabulary mainly the result of rural emigration. As a result of 19th-century Lower Breton immigration, Breton was once widely spoken in parts of Nantes. Nantes signed the charter of the Public Office for the Breton Language in 2013. Since then, the city has supported its six bilingual schools and introduced bilingual signage.

==Economy==

For centuries, Nantes&#x27;s economy was linked to the Loire and the Atlantic; the city had France&#x27;s largest harbour in the 18th century. Food processing predominated during the Industrial Age, with sugar refineries (Beghin-Say), biscuit factories (LU and BN), canned fish (Saupiquet and Tipiak) and processed vegetables (Bonduelle and Cassegrain); these brands still dominate the French market. The Nantes region is France&#x27;s largest food producer; the city has recently become a hub of innovation in food security, with laboratories and firms such as Eurofins Scientific.

Nantes experienced deindustrialisation after port activity in Saint-Nazaire largely ceased, culminating in the 1987 closure of the shipyards. At that time, the city attempted to attract service firms. Nantes capitalised on its culture and proximity to the sea to present itself as creative and modern. Capgemini (management consulting), SNCF (rail) and Bouygues Telecom opened large offices in the city, followed by smaller companies. Since 2000 Nantes has developed a business district, Euronantes, with of office space and 10,000 jobs. Although its stock exchange was merged with that of Paris in 1990, Nantes is the third-largest financial centre in France after Paris and Lyon.
The city has one of the best-performing economies in France, producing annually; returns to the local economy. Nantes has over 25,000 businesses with 167,000 jobs, and its metropolitan area has 42,000 firms and 328,000 jobs. The city is one of France&#x27;s most dynamic in job creation, with 19,000 jobs created in Nantes Métropole between 2007 and 2014 (outperforming larger cities such as Marseille, Lyon and Nice). The communes surrounding Nantes have industrial estates and retail parks, many along the region&#x27;s ring road. The metropolitan area has ten large shopping centres; the largest, Atlantis in Saint-Herblain, is a mall with 116 shops and several superstores (including IKEA). The shopping centres threaten independent shops in central Nantes, but it remains the region&#x27;s largest retail area with about 2,000 shops. Tourism is a growing sector and Nantes, with two million visitors annually, is France&#x27;s seventh-most-visited city.

In 2021, 79.8 percent of the city&#x27;s businesses were involved in trade, transport and services; 12.2 percent in public administration, education and health; 4.4 percent in construction, and 3.6 percent in industry. Although industry is less significant than it was before the 1970s, Nantes is France&#x27;s second-largest centre for aeronautics. The European company Airbus produces its fleet&#x27;s wingboxes and radomes in Nantes, employing about 2,000 people. The city&#x27;s remaining port terminal still handles wood, sugar, fertiliser, metals, sand and cereals, ten percent of the total Nantes–Saint-Nazaire harbour traffic (along the Loire estuary). The Atlanpole technopole, in northern Nantes on its border with Carquefou, intends to develop technological and science sectors throughout the Pays de la Loire. With a business incubator, it has 422 companies and 71 research and higher-education facilities and specialises in biopharmaceuticals, information technology, renewable energy, mechanics, food production and naval engineering. Creative industries in Nantes had over 9,000 architectural, design, fashion, media, visual-arts and digital-technology companies in 2016, a 15 percent job-creation rate between 2007 and 2012 and have a hub under construction on the Isle of Nantes.

==Architecture==

Nantes&#x27;s cityscape is primarily recent, with more buildings built during the 20th century than in any other era. The city has 127 buildings listed as &quot;monuments historiques&quot;, the 19th-ranked French city. Most of the old buildings were made of tuffeau stone (a light, easily sculpted sandstone typical of the Loire Valley) and cheaper schist. Because of its sturdiness, granite was often used for foundations. Old buildings on the former Feydeau Island and the neighbouring embankments often lean because they were built on damp soil.

Nantes has a few structures dating to antiquity and the early Middle Ages. Remnants of the third-century Roman city wall exist in the old town. The Saint-Étienne chapel, in the Saint-Donatien cemetery outside the city centre, dates to 510 and was originally part of a Roman necropolis. The Roman city walls were largely replaced during the 13th and 15th centuries. Although many of the walls were destroyed in the 18th century, some segments (such as Porte Saint-Pierre, built in 1478) survived.
Several 15th- and 16th-century half-timbered houses still stand in Le Bouffay, an ancient area corresponding to Nantes&#x27;s medieval core which is bordered by Nantes Cathedral and the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany. The large, Gothic cathedral replaced an earlier Romanesque church. Its construction took 457 years, from 1434 to 1891. The cathedral&#x27;s tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany and his wife is an example of French Renaissance sculpture. The Psallette, built next to the cathedral about 1500, is a late-Gothic mansion. The Gothic castle is one of Nantes&#x27;s chief landmarks. Begun in 1207, many of its current buildings date to the 15th century. Although the castle had a military role, it was also a residence for the ducal court. Granite towers on the outside hide delicate tuffeau-stone ornaments on its inner facades, designed in Flamboyant style with Italianate influence. The Counter-Reformation inspired two baroque churches: the 1655 Oratory Chapel and Sainte-Croix Church, rebuilt in 1670. A municipal belfry clock (originally on a tower of Bouffay Castle, a prison demolished after the French Revolution) was added to the church in 1860.
After the Renaissance, Nantes developed west of its medieval core along new embankments. Trade-derived wealth permitted the construction of many public monuments during the 18th century, most designed by the neoclassical architects Jean-Baptiste Ceineray and Mathurin Crucy. They include the Chamber of Accounts of Brittany (now the &quot;préfecture&quot;, 1763–1783); the Graslin Theatre (1788); Place Foch, with its column and statue of Louis XVI (1790), and the stock exchange (1790–1815). Place Royale was completed in 1790, and the large fountain added in 1865. Its statues represent the city of Nantes, the Loire and its main tributaries. The city&#x27;s 18th-century heritage is also reflected in the &quot;hôtels particuliers&quot; and other private buildings for the wealthy, such as the Cours Cambronne (inspired by Georgian terraces). Although many of the 18th-century buildings have a neoclassical design, they are adorned with sculpted rococo faces and balconies. This architecture has been called &quot;Nantais baroque&quot;.
Most of Nantes&#x27;s churches were rebuilt during the 19th century, a period of population growth and religious revival after the French Revolution. Most were rebuilt in Gothic Revival style, including the city&#x27;s two basilicas: Saint-Nicolas and Saint-Donatien. The first, built between 1844 and 1869, was one of France&#x27;s first Gothic Revival projects. The latter was built between 1881 and 1901, after the Franco-Prussian War (which triggered another Catholic revival in France). Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Port, near the Loire, is an example of 19th-century neoclassicism. Built in 1852, its dome was inspired by that of Les Invalides in Paris. The Passage Pommeraye, built in 1840–1843, is a multi-storey shopping arcade typical of the mid-19th century.

Industrial architecture includes several factories converted into leisure and business space, primarily on the Isle of Nantes. The former Lefèvre-Utile factory is known for its Tour Lu, a publicity tower built in 1909. Two cranes in the former harbour, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, have also become landmarks. Recent architecture is dominated by postwar concrete reconstructions, modernist buildings and examples of contemporary architecture such as the courts of justice, designed by Jean Nouvel in 2000.

==Culture==

===Museums===

Nantes has several museums. The Fine Art Museum is the city&#x27;s largest. Opened in 1900, it has an extensive collection ranging from Italian Renaissance paintings to contemporary sculpture. The museum includes works by Tintoretto, Brueghel, Rubens, Georges de La Tour, Ingres, Monet, Picasso, Kandinsky and Anish Kapoor. The Historical Museum of Nantes, in the castle, is dedicated to local history and houses the municipal collections. Items include paintings, sculptures, photographs, maps and furniture displayed to illustrate major points of Nantes history such as the Atlantic slave trade, industrialisation and the Second World War.

The Dobrée Museum, closed for repairs , houses the &quot;département&quot; archaeological and decorative-arts collections. The building is a Romanesque Revival mansion facing a 15th-century manor. Collections include a golden reliquary made for Anne of Brittany&#x27;s heart, medieval statues and timber frames, coins, weapons, jewellery, manuscripts and archaeological finds. The Natural History Museum of Nantes is one of the largest of its kind in France. It has more than 1.6 million zoological specimens and several thousand mineral samples. The Machines of the Isle of Nantes, opened in 2007 in the converted shipyards, has automatons, prototypes inspired by deep-sea creatures and a walking elephant. With 620,000 visitors in 2015, the &quot;Machines&quot; were the most-visited non-free site in Loire-Atlantique. Smaller museums include the Jules Verne Museum (dedicated to the author, who was born in Nantes) and the Planetarium. The HAB Galerie, located in a former banana warehouse on the Loire, is Nantes&#x27;s largest art gallery. Owned by the city council, it is used for contemporary-art exhibitions. The council manages four other exhibition spaces, and the city has several private galleries.

===Venues===

&quot;Le Zénith Nantes Métropole&quot;, an indoor arena in Saint-Herblain, has a capacity of 9,000 and is France&#x27;s largest concert venue outside Paris. Since its opening in 2006, Placebo, Supertramp, Snoop Dogg and Bob Dylan have performed on its stage. Nantes&#x27;s largest venue is &quot;La Cité, Nantes Events Center&quot;, a 2,000-seat auditorium. It hosts concerts, congresses and exhibitions, and is the primary venue of the Pays de la Loire National Orchestra. The Graslin Theatre, built in 1788, is home to the Angers-Nantes Opéra. The former LU biscuit factory, facing the castle, has been converted into Le Lieu unique. It includes a Turkish bath, restaurant and bookshop and hosts art exhibits, drama, music and dance performances. The 879-seat Grand T is the Loire-Atlantique &quot;département&quot; theatre, and the Salle Vasse is managed by the city. Other theatres include the &quot;Théâtre universitaire&quot; and several private venues. La Fabrique, a cultural entity managed by the city, has three sites which include music studios and concert venues. The largest is Stereolux, specialising in rock concerts, experimental happenings and other contemporary performances. The 140-seat Pannonica specialises in jazz, and the nearby 503-seat Salle Paul-Fort is dedicated to contemporary French singers. Nantes has five cinemas, with others throughout the metropolitan area.

===Events and festivals===

The Royal de Luxe street theatre company moved to Nantes in 1989, and has produced a number of shows in the city. The company is noted for its large marionettes (including a giraffe, the Little Giant and the Sultan&#x27;s Elephant), and has also performed in Lisbon, Berlin, London and Santiago. Former Royal de Luxe machine designer François Delarozière created the Machines of the Isle of Nantes and its large walking elephant in 2007. The Machines sponsor theatre, dance, concerts, ice-sculpting shows and performances for children in the spring and fall and at Christmastime.

&quot;Estuaire&quot; contemporary-art exhibitions were held along the Loire estuary in 2007, 2009 and 2012. They left several permanent works of art in Nantes and inspired the Voyage à Nantes, a series of contemporary-art exhibitions across the city which has been held every summer since 2012. A route (a green line painted on the pavement) helps visitors make the &quot;voyage&quot; between the exhibitions and the city&#x27;s major landmarks. Some works of art are permanent, and others are used for a summer. Permanent sculptures include Daniel Buren&#x27;s &quot;Anneaux&quot; (a series of 18 rings along the Loire reminiscent of Atlantic slave trade shackles) and works by François Morellet and Dan Graham.

&quot;La Folle Journée&quot; (&quot;The Mad Day&quot;, an alternate title of Pierre Beaumarchais&#x27; play &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;) is a classical music festival held each winter. The original one-day festival now lasts for five days. Its programme has a main theme (past themes have included exile, nature, Russia and Frédéric Chopin), mixing classics with lesser-known and -performed works. The concept has been exported to Bilbao, Tokyo and Warsaw, and the festival sold a record 154,000 tickets in 2015. The September Rendez-vous de l&#x27;Erdre couples a jazz festival with a pleasure-boating show on the Erdre, exposing the public to a musical genre considered elitist; all concerts are free. Annual attendance is about 150,000. The Three Continents Festival is an annual film festival dedicated to Asia, Africa and South America, with a Mongolfière d&#x27;or (Golden Hot-air Balloon) awarded to the best film. Nantes also hosts &quot;Univerciné&quot; (festivals dedicated to films in English, Italian, Russian and German) and a smaller Spanish film festival. The Scopitone festival is dedicated to digital art, and &quot;Utopiales&quot; is an international science fiction festival.

=== Slavery Memorial ===

A path along the Loire river banks, between the Anne-de-Bretagne Bridge and the Victor-Schoelcher footbridge begins the Nantes slavery memorial. The path is covered in 2,000 spaced glass inserts, with 1,710 of them commemorating the names of slave ships and their port dates in Nantes. The other 290 inserts name ports in Africa, the Americas, and the area around the Indian Ocean. The path and surrounding 1.73-acre park lead to the under-the-docks part of the memorial which opens with a staircase, leading visitors underground closer to the water level of the river, which can be seen through the gaps between the support pillars. Upon entry, visitors are greeted with The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the word &quot;freedom&quot; written in 47 different languages from areas affected by the slave trade. Other etchings of quotes by figures like Nelson Mandela and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. appear on the slanted frosted glass wall which lined the memorial wall opposite the pillars which open to the river. These quotes come from across the globe, from all four continents affected by the slave trade, and span over five centuries, from the 17th to the 21st. At the end of the hall, toward the exit, is a room with the timeline of slavery as it became abolished in various countries around the world.

===In the arts===

Nantes has been described as the birthplace of surrealism, since André Breton (leader of the movement) met Jacques Vaché there in 1916. In &quot;Nadja&quot; (1928), André Breton called Nantes &quot;perhaps with Paris the only city in France where I have the impression that something worthwhile may happen to me&quot;. Fellow surrealist Julien Gracq wrote &quot;The Shape of a City&quot;, published in 1985, about the city. Nantes also inspired Stendhal (in his 1838 &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;un touriste&quot;); Gustave Flaubert (in his 1881 &quot;Par les champs et par les grèves&quot;, where he describes his journey through Brittany); Henry James, in his 1884 &quot;A Little Tour in France&quot;; André Pieyre de Mandiargues in &quot;Le Musée noir&quot; (1946), and Paul-Louis Rossi in &quot;Nantes&quot; (1987).

The city is the hometown of French New Wave film director Jacques Demy. Two of Demy&#x27;s films were set and shot in Nantes: &quot;Lola&quot; (1964) and &quot;A Room in Town&quot; (1982). The Passage Pommeraye appears briefly in &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;. Other films set (or filmed) in Nantes include &quot;God&#x27;s Thunder&quot; by Denys de La Patellière (1965), &quot;The Married Couple of the Year Two&quot; by Jean-Paul Rappeneau (1971), &quot;Day Off&quot; by Pascal Thomas (2001) and &quot;Black Venus&quot; by Abdellatif Kechiche (2010). Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Keep Your Right Up&quot; was filmed at its airport in 1987.

Nantes appears in a number of songs, the best-known to non-French audiences being 2007&#x27;s &quot;Nantes&quot; by the American band Beirut. French-language songs include &quot;Nantes&quot; by Barbara (1964) and &quot;Nantes&quot; by Renan Luce (2009). The city is mentioned in about 50 folk songs, making it the most-sung-about city in France after Paris. &quot;Dans les prisons de Nantes&quot; is the most popular, with versions recorded by Édith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Tri Yann and Nolwenn Leroy. Other popular folk songs include &quot;Le pont de Nantes&quot; (recorded by Guy Béart in 1967 and Nana Mouskouri in 1978), &quot;Jean-François de Nantes&quot; (a sea shanty) and the bawdy &quot;De Nantes à Montaigu&quot;.

British painter J. M. W. Turner visited Nantes in 1826 as part of a journey in the Loire Valley, and later painted a watercolour view of Nantes from Feydeau Island. The painting was bought by the city in 1994, and is on exhibit at the Historical Museum in the castle. An engraving of this work was published in The Keepsake annual for 1831, with an illustrative poem entitled by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. Turner also made two sketches of the city, which are in collections at Tate Britain.

===Cuisine===

During the 19th century Nantes-born gastronome Charles Monselet praised the &quot;special character&quot; of the local &quot;plebeian&quot; cuisine, which included buckwheat crepes, &quot;caillebotte&quot; fermented milk and &quot;fouace&quot; brioche. The Nantes region is renowned in France for market gardens and is a major producer of corn salad, leeks, radishes and carrots. Nantes has a wine-growing region, the &quot;Vignoble nantais&quot;, primarily south of the Loire. It is the largest producer of dry white wines in France, chiefly Muscadet and &quot;Gros Plant&quot; (usually served with fish, langoustines and oysters).

Local fishing ports such as La Turballe and Le Croisic mainly offer shrimp and sardines, and eels, lampreys, zander and northern pike are caught in the Loire. Local vegetables and fish are widely available in the city&#x27;s eighteen markets, including the Talensac covered market (Nantes&#x27;s largest and best known). Although local restaurants tend to serve simple dishes made with fresh local products, exotic trends have influenced many chefs in recent years.

&quot;Beurre blanc&quot; is Nantes&#x27;s most-famous local specialty. Made with Muscadet, it was invented around 1900 in Saint-Julien-de-Concelles (on the south bank of the Loire) and has become a popular accompaniment for fish. Other specialties are the LU and BN biscuits, including the Petit-Beurre (produced since 1886), &#x27; (sweets made with flavoured melted sugar) and similar &#x27; sweets with marmalade filling, &quot;gâteau nantais&quot; (a rum cake invented in 1820), &quot;&quot; and &quot;Mâchecoulais&quot; cheeses and &quot;fouace&quot;, a star-shaped brioche served with new wine in autumn.

==Education==

The University of Nantes was first founded in 1460 by Francis II, Duke of Brittany, but it failed to become a large institution during the Ancien Régime. It disappeared in 1793 with the abolition of French universities. During the 19th century, when many of the former universities reopened, Nantes was neglected and local students had to go to Rennes and Angers. In 1961 the university was finally recreated, but Nantes has not established itself as a large university city. The university had about 30,000 students during the 2013–2014 academic year, and the metropolitan area had a total student population of 53,000. This was lower than in nearby Rennes (64,000), and Nantes is the ninth-largest commune in France in its percentage of students. The university is part of the EPSCP Bretagne-Loire Université, which joins seven universities in western France to improve the region&#x27;s academic and research potential.

In addition to the university, Nantes has a number of colleges and other institutes of higher education. Audencia, a private management school, is ranked as one of the world&#x27;s best by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and &quot;The Economist&quot;. The city has five engineering schools: Oniris (veterinary medicine and food safety), (mechanical and civil engineering), Polytech Nantes (digital technology and civil engineering), École des mines de Nantes (now IMT Atlantique) (information technology, nuclear technology, safety and energy) and ICAM (research and logistics). Nantes has three other &quot;grandes écoles&quot;: the École supérieure du bois (forestry and wood processing), the School of Design and (computing). Other institutes of higher education include a national merchant navy school, a fine-arts school, a national architectural school and Epitech and Supinfo (computing).

==Sport==

Nantes has several large sports facilities. The largest is the Stade de la Beaujoire, built for UEFA Euro 1984. The stadium, which also hosted matches during the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup, has 37,473 seats. The second-largest venue is the Hall XXL, an exhibition hall on the Stade de la Beaujoire grounds. The 10,700-seat stadium was selected as a venue for the 2017 World Men&#x27;s Handball Championship. Smaller facilities include the 4,700-seat indoor Palais des Sports, a venue for EuroBasket 1983. The nearby Mangin Beaulieu sports complex has 2,500 seats and Pierre Quinon Stadium, an athletics stadium within the University of Nantes, has 790 seats. La Trocardière, an indoor 4,238-seat stadium, is in Rezé. The Erdre has a marina and a centre for rowing, sailing and canoeing, and the city has six swimming pools.

Six teams in Nantes play at a high national or international level. Best known is FC Nantes, which is a member of Ligue 1 for the 2018–19 season. Since its formation in 1943, the club has won eight Championnat titles and three Coupes de France. FC Nantes has several French professional football records, including the most consecutive seasons in the elite division (44), most wins in a season (26), consecutive wins (32) and consecutive home wins (92 games, nearly five years). In handball, volleyball and basketball, Nantes&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s clubs play in the French first division: HBC Nantes and Nantes Loire Atlantique Handball (handball), and (volleyball), Hermine de Nantes Atlantique and (basketball). The men&#x27;s (futsal) team plays in the Championnat de France de Futsal, and the main athletics team (Nantes Métropole Athlétisme) includes some of France&#x27;s best athletes.

==Transport==

The city is linked to Paris by the A11 motorway, which passes through Angers, Le Mans and Chartres. Nantes is on the Way of the Estuaries, a network of motorways connecting northern France and the Spanish border in the south-west while bypassing Paris. The network serves Rouen, Le Havre, Rennes, La Rochelle and Bordeaux. South of Nantes, the road corresponds to the A83 motorway; north of the city (towards Rennes) it is the RN137, a free highway. These motorways form a ring road around the city, France&#x27;s second longest after the ring in Bordeaux.

Nantes&#x27;s central railway station is connected by TGV trains to Paris, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg. The LGV Atlantique high-speed railway reaches Paris in two hours, ten minutes (compared with four hours by car). With almost 12 million passengers each year, the Nantes station is the sixth-busiest in France outside Paris. In addition to TGV trains, the city is connected by Intercités trains to Rennes, Vannes, Quimper, Tours, Orléans, La Rochelle and Bordeaux. Local TER trains serve Pornic, Cholet or Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie.
Nantes Atlantique Airport in Bouguenais, south-west of the city centre, serves about 80 destinations in Europe (primarily in France, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Greece) and connects airports in Africa, the Caribbean and Canada. Air traffic has increased from 2.6 million passengers in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2014, while its capacity has been estimated at 3.5 million passengers per year. A new Aéroport du Grand Ouest in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, north of Nantes, was projected from the 1970s, to create a hub serving north-western France. Its construction was however strongly opposed, primarily by green and anti-capitalist activists. The potential construction site was long occupied and the project became a political topic on the national scale. The French government eventually decided to renounce to the project in 2018.

Public transport in Nantes is managed by Semitan, also known as &quot;Tan&quot;. One of the world&#x27;s first horsebus transit systems was developed in the city in 1826. Nantes built its first compressed-air tram network in 1879, which was electrified in 1911. Like most European tram networks, Nantes&#x27;s disappeared during the 1950s in the wake of automobiles and buses. However, in 1985 Nantes was the first city in France to reintroduce trams. The city has an extensive public-transport network consisting of trams, buses and river shuttles. The Nantes tramway has three lines and a total of of track. Semitan counted 132.6 million trips in 2015, of which 72.3 million were by tram. Navibus, the river shuttle, has two lines: one on the Erdre and the other on the Loire. The latter has 520,000 passengers annually and succeeds the Roquio service, which operated on the Loire from 1887 to the 1970s.

Nantes has also developed a tram-train system, the Nantes tram-train, which would allow suburban trains to run on tram lines; the system already exists in Mulhouse (in eastern France) and Karlsruhe, Germany. The city has two tram-train lines: Nantes-Clisson (southern) and Nantes-Châteaubriant (northern). Neither is yet connected to the existing tram network, and resemble small suburban trains more than tram-trains. The Bicloo bicycle-sharing system has 880 bicycles at 103 stations.

<text>The Actinidiaceae are a small family of flowering plants. The family has three genera and about 360 species and is a member of the order Ericales.

==Distribution==
They are temperate and subtropical woody vines, shrubs, and trees, native to Asia (&quot;Actinidia&quot; or kiwifruit, &quot;Clematoclethra&quot;, and &quot;Saurauia&quot;) and Central America and South America (&quot;Saurauia&quot; only). &quot;Saurauia&quot;, with its 300 species, is the largest genus in this family. Although now confined to Asia and tropical Central and South America, evidence indicates in the past the family had a wider distribution. The now extinct genus &quot;Parasaurauia&quot; is thought to have belonged to the Actinidiaceae and lived in North America during the early Campanian.

==Characteristics==
The plants are usually small trees or shrubs, or sometimes vines (&quot;Actinidia&quot;). The alternate, simple, spiral leaves have serrated or entire margins. They lack stipules or are minutely stipulated. They are often beset with rather flattened bristles.

The flowers grow solitary or are aggregated in terminal cymes, with free sepals and petals. Except for members of the genus &quot;Clematoclethra&quot; which have 10 stamens, the stamens are numerous and originally attached at the back. They invert just before the flower starts expanding, so their bases become apical.

The plants may be dioecious, monoecious, or hermaphroditic. The fruit is usually a berry, such as the edible kiwifruit, a cultivar from the genus &quot;Actinidia&quot;.

==Evidence supporting placement within the Ericales==
Before genetic evidence appeared in the last 10 years, the placement of the Actinidiaceae within the Ericales was highly controversial. The USDA Plants Database, a resource considered authoritative, still places the Actinidaceae within the Theales, an order which has been shown not to be monophyletic. Placement of the Actinidiaceae within the Ericales has been strongly supported recently by genetic evidence, and contrary to previous thought, it is not a basal member of the Ericales. Multiple studies using genetic evidence now firmly place the Actinidiaceae in the Ericoid clade, a monophyletic group consisting of the Ericaceae, the Cyrillaceae, the Clethraceae, the Sarraceniaceae, and the Roridulaceae. Further genetic evidence points to the Actinidiaceae being sister to the Roridulaceae, with the Roridulaceae and Sarraceniaceae, forming another, smaller, monophyletic group.

==Evidence supporting monophyly of the Actinidiaceae==
What genera were to be placed in the Actinidiaceae before recent genetic and micromorphological studies emerged was highly controversial. Before recent evidence, the genus &quot;Sladenia&quot; was often placed within the Actinidiaceae. Also, &quot;Saurauia&quot; was sometimes considered its own family. Thus, before more detailed studies started, two to four genera could be placed within the Actinidiaceae. Micromorphological characters have confirmed that &quot;Sladenia&quot; does not belong in the Actinidiaceae. Furthermore, biological characteristics of the cells, and molecular evidence have confirmed the three genera currently circumscribed in the Actinidiaceae, &quot;Clematoclethra&quot;, &quot;Saurauia&quot;, and &quot;Actinidia&quot;, do indeed form a monophyletic group.

<text>Actinidia is a genus of woody and, with a few exceptions, dioecious plants native to temperate eastern Asia, occurring throughout most of China, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, and extending north to southern areas of Russian Far East and south into Indochina. The genus includes shrubs growing to tall, and vigorous, strong-growing vines, growing up to in tree canopies. They mostly tolerate temperatures down to around , and some are much hardier.

The leaves are alternate and simple, with a dentated margin and a long petiole. The flowers are solitary or in axillary cymes, usually white, with five small petals. Most of the species are dioecious with separate male and female plants, but some are monoecious. The fruit is a large berry containing numerous small seeds; in most species, the fruit is edible. In particular, this genus is known for the species &quot;Actinidia deliciosa&quot;, one of the most common cultivated kiwifruits, and for the hardy ornamental &quot;A. kolomikta&quot;.

==Fossil record==

== Uses ==
Kiwifruit is a cultivar group of &quot;A. deliciosa&quot;, and hardy kiwi is the species &quot;Actinidia arguta&quot;, which has small fruit weighing , with green edible skins and green flesh; it is hardier than &quot;A. deliciosa&quot;. Some species are grown as ornamental plants, notably &quot;A. kolomikta&quot;.

In Japan, &quot;Actinidia polygama&quot; (silver vine) is noted for having an effect on cats much like that of catnip. It is mentioned in the saying 猫にまたたび、女郎に小判 (&quot;neko ni matatabi, jorō ni koban&quot;, &quot;silver vine to a cat, a coin to a prostitute&quot;), meaning to put someone in a good mood by providing that which they most desire.

&quot;A. kolomikta&quot; is the hardiest species (to about -40 °C or -40 °F), and has distinctive white- and pink-variegated foliage even on wild plants, an unusual phenomenon. Its fruit is very small, weighing or less.

==Etymology==
&quot;Actinidia&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek &#x27;ray&#x27;, and is a reference to the rayed styles of the flowers.

<doc id="67457" wikidata="Q248243" url="?curid=67457" title="Second Viennese School">
<text>The Second Viennese School () was the group of composers that comprised Arnold Schoenberg and his pupils, particularly Alban Berg and Anton Webern, and close associates in early 20th-century Vienna. Their music was initially characterized by late-Romantic expanded tonality and later, a totally chromatic expressionism without a firm tonal centre, often referred to as atonality; and later still, Schoenberg&#x27;s serial twelve-tone technique. Twelve tone Composition was revolutionized by Arnold Schoenberg. Using this technique when composing he made sure he used all 12 notes in a chromatic scale when forming a melody, this would be called the “Primeseries”. This series would later be enhanced in his compositions through permutations such as, Retrogrades, Inversions, Transformations etc. How this happens is, Schoenberg taking the pitches of the Primeseries and through his “Magic Square” of permutations takes said pitches and depending on which permutation he is utilizing, creates a new series of pitches to form a new melody. Later a French composer named Pierre Boulez takes Schoenberg&#x27;s development and enhances it even further by serializing not only Pitch, but Rhythm, Articulation, and Dynamics as well. Adorno said that the twelve-tone method, when it had evolved into maturity, was a &quot;veritable message in a bottle&quot;, addressed to an unknown and uncertain future. Though this common development took place, it neither followed a common time-line nor a cooperative path. Likewise, it was not a direct result of Schoenberg&#x27;s teaching—which, as his various published textbooks demonstrate, was highly traditional and conservative. Schoenberg&#x27;s textbooks also reveal that the Second Viennese School spawned not from the development of his serial method, but rather from the influence of his creative example.

== Members ==
The principal members of the school, besides Schoenberg, were Alban Berg and Anton Webern, who were among his first composition pupils. Both of them had already produced copious and talented music in a late Romantic idiom but felt they gained new direction and discipline from Schoenberg&#x27;s teaching. Other members of this generation included Ernst Krenek, Heinrich Jalowetz, Erwin Stein and Egon Wellesz, and somewhat later Eduard Steuermann, Hanns Eisler, Robert Gerhard, Norbert von Hannenheim, Rudolf Kolisch, Paul A. Pisk, Karl Rankl, Josef Rufer, Nikos Skalkottas, Viktor Ullmann, and Winfried Zillig. Schoenberg&#x27;s brother-in-law Alexander Zemlinsky is sometimes included as part of the Second Viennese School, though he was never Schoenberg&#x27;s pupil and never renounced a traditional conception of tonality. 

Though Berg and Webern both followed Schoenberg into total chromaticism and both, each in his own way, adopted twelve-tone technique soon after he did, not all of these others did so, or waited for a considerable time before following suit. Several yet later disciples, such as Zillig, the Catalan Gerhard, the Transylvanian Hannenheim and the Greek Skalkottas, are sometimes covered by the term, though (apart from Gerhard) they never studied in Vienna but as part of Schoenberg&#x27;s masterclass in Berlin. 

Membership in the school is not generally extended to Schoenberg&#x27;s many pupils in the United States from 1933, such as John Cage, Leon Kirchner and Gerald Strang, nor to many other composers who, at a greater remove, wrote compositions evocative of the Second Viennese style, such as the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould. By extension, however, certain pupils of Schoenberg&#x27;s pupils, such as Berg&#x27;s pupil Hans Erich Apostel and Webern&#x27;s pupils René Leibowitz, Leopold Spinner and Ludwig Zenk, are usually included in the roll-call.

The broader circle of the Second Viennese School included, among others, Oskar Adler, Theodor W. Adorno, Hans Erich Apostel, Robert Gerhard, Norbert von Hannenheim, Heinrich Jalowetz, Hanns Jelinek, Sándor Jemnitz, , Rudolf Kolisch of the Kolisch Quartet, Ernst Krenek, , , Olga Novakovic, Paul Pisk, Rudolf Ploderer, Josef Polnauer, Erwin Ratz, , Josef Rufer, Peter Schacht, Julius Schloss, Nikos Skalkottas, Erwin Stein, Eduard Steuermann, Viktor Ullmann, Rudolf Weirich, Adolph Weiss, Egon Wellesz, Alexander Zemlinsky, and Winfried Zillig.

Contemporaneous performers, friends, admirers, and supporters of the circle at various times included figures as diverse as Guido Adler, David Josef Bach, Ernst Bachrich, Imre [Emerich] Balabán and Béla Bartók of the New Hungarian Music Society, Julius Bittner, Artur Bodanzky, Mark Brunswick, Richard Buhlig, Edward Clark, Henry Cowell, Herbert Eimert, , Marya Freund, Felix Galimir of the Galimir Quartet, Rudolph Ganz, George Gershwin, Richard Gerstl, Walter Gropius, Marie Gutheil-Schoder, Alois Hába, Emil Hertzka, Jascha Horenstein, Felicie Hüni-Mihacsek, Erich Itor Kahn, Wassily Kandinsky, Hans Keller, Erich Kleiber, Gustav Klimt, Wilhelm Klitsch, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Louis Krasner, Józef Koffler, Oskar Kokoschka, René Leibowitz, Erich Leinsdorf, Adolf Loos, Darius Milhaud and Francis Poulenc of &quot;Les Six&quot;, Elisabeth Lutyens, Gustav and Alma Mahler, Frank Martin, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Soma Morgenstern, Johanna Müller-Hermann, Dika Newlin, Will Ogdon, Max Oppenheimer, Otakar Ostrčil, Maurice Ravel, Rudolph Reti, , Arnold Rosé et al. of the Rosé Quartet, Hans Rosbaud, Nikolai Roslavets et al. of the Association for Contemporary Music, Hermann Scherchen, Egon Schiele, , , Erich Schmid, Franz Schreker, Erwin Schulhoff, Eugenie Schwarzwald, Rudolf Serkin, Roger Sessions, Peter Stadlen, , Igor Stravinsky, Georg Trakl, Edgard Varèse et al. of the International Composers Guild, Steuermann&#x27;s sister Salka Viertel, Imre Waldbauer et al. of the , Franz Werfel, Arnold Zweig, and &quot;Jung-Wien&quot; writers Peter Altenberg, Hermann Bahr, Karl Kraus, and Arthur Schnitzler.

== Practices ==
Though the school included highly distinct musical personalities (the styles of Berg and Webern are in fact very different from each other, and from Schoenberg—for example, only the works of Webern conform to the rule stated by Schoenberg that only a single row be used throughout all movements of a composition—while Gerhard and Skalkottas were closely involved with the folk music of their respective countries) the impression of cohesiveness was enhanced by the literary efforts of some of its members. Wellesz wrote the first book on Schoenberg, who was also the subject of several Festschriften put together by his friends and pupils; Rufer and Spinner both wrote books on the technique of twelve-tone composition; and Leibowitz&#x27;s influential study of Schoenberg, Berg and Webern, &quot;Schoenberg et son école&quot;, helped to establish the image of a school in the period immediately after World War II in France and abroad. Several of those mentioned (e.g. Jalowetz, Rufer) were also influential as teachers, and others (e.g. Kolisch, Rankl, Stein, Steuermann, Zillig) as performers, in disseminating the ideals, ideas and approved repertoire of the group. Perhaps the culmination of the school took place at Darmstadt almost immediately after World War II, at the Internationale Ferienkurse für Neue Musik, wherein Schoenberg—who was invited but too ill to travel—was ultimately usurped in musical ideology by the music of his pupil, Webern, as composers and performers from the Second Viennese School (e.g. Leibowitz, Rufer, Adorno, Kolisch, Heiss, Stadlen, Stuckenschmidt, Scherchen) converged with the new serialists (e.g. Boulez, Stockhausen, Maderna, Nono, et al.).

== First Viennese School ==
German musical literature refers to the grouping as the &quot;Wiener Schule&quot; or &quot;Neue Wiener Schule&quot;. The existence of a &quot;First Viennese School&quot; is debatable. The term is often assumed to connote the great Vienna-based masters of the Classical style working in the late 18th and early 19th century, particularly Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert. Though Mozart and Schubert did not study with Haydn, Beethoven did for a time receive lessons from the older master, Haydn, though he was not a pupil in the sense that Berg and Webern were pupils of Schoenberg.

== In art and culture ==

Berg, Schoenberg, or Webern featured (or were inferred) in the work of composers Michael Dellaira, Ernst Krenek, and René Staar and writers William H. Gass, Gert Jonke, Thomas Mann, Thomas Pynchon, and Amelia Rosselli. Erika Fox named her &quot;Malinconia Militare&quot; (2003) after the first line of Rosselli&#x27;s &quot;Webern Opus 4&quot;.

Webern&#x27;s Op. 27 was used in &quot;The Sopranos&quot; episode &quot;Bust Out&quot;.

<doc id="67458" wikidata="Q5137803" url="?curid=67458" title="Coalbed methane extraction">
<text>Coalbed methane extraction (CBM extraction) is a method for extracting methane from a coal deposit. Coal bed methane (CBM) is one of the factors restricting the safe production of coal in underground coal mines. It is also a form of high-quality energy that can be used in many fields such as power generation, heating, and chemical industries. CBM extraction is therefore carried out before extraction with a view of increasing the safety of mining coal beds, and as a useful energy resource to be exploited.

==Basic principles==
Methane adsorbed into a solid coal matrix (coal macerals) will be released if the coal seam is depressurized. Methane may be extracted by drilling wells into the coal seam. The goal is to decrease the water pressure by pumping water from the well. The decrease in pressure allows methane to desorb from the coal and flow as a gas up the well to the surface. Methane is then compressed and piped to market.

The objective is to avoid putting methane into the water line but allow it to flow up the backside of the well (casing) to the compressor station. If the water level is pumped too low during dewatering, methane may travel up the tubing into the water line causing the well to become &quot;gassy&quot;. Although methane may be recovered in a water-gas separator at the surface, pumping water and gas is inefficient and can cause pump wear and breakdown.

==Areas with CBM extraction==
Tens of thousands of methane wells have been drilled, and extensive support facilities such as roads, pipelines, and compressors have been installed for CBM extraction in the Powder River Basin of northeast Wyoming and southeast Montana and now in India at West Bengal- Ranigunj, Panagarh, etc. Seven percent of the natural gas (methane) currently produced in the United States comes from CBM extraction. Methane from coalbed reservoirs can be recovered economically, but disposal of water is an environmental concern.

There are also sites in Central Scotland at Letham Moss.
Most gas in coal is stored on the internal surfaces of organic matter. Because of its large internal surface area, coal stores 6 to 7 times more gas than the equivalent rock volume of a conventional gas reservoir. Gas content generally increases with coal rank, with depth of burial of the coal bed, and with reservoir pressure. Fractures, or cleats, within coal beds, are usually filled with water. Deeper coal beds contain less water, but that water is more saline. Removing water from the coal bed reduces pressure and releases methane. Large amounts of water, sometimes saline brine, are produced from coalbed methane wells. The greatest water volumes are produced during the early stages of production. Environmentally acceptable disposal of brine is a major cost factor for economic methane production. Fresh water may be discharged on the surface, but the brine is usually injected into the rock at a depth where the salinity of the injected brine is less than the connate fluids of the host rock. Evaporation of water for recovery of potentially salable solid residues might be feasible in regions having high evaporation rates.

== Measuring the gas content of coal ==
Coal bed gas content measurements are commonly used in mine safety as well as coal bed methane resource assessment and recovery applications. Gas content determination techniques generally fall into two categories: (1) direct methods which measure the volume of methane released from a coal sample sealed into a desorption canister and (2) indirect methods based on empirical correlations, or laboratory-derived sorption isotherm methane storage capacity data. Laboratory sorption isotherms provide information about the storage capacity of a coal sample if these are measured under geological realistic pressure and temperature conditions. Thus, the maximum gas content that can be expected for methane recovery can be assessed from such laboratory isotherm measurements.

The total gas content by the indirect methods is based on the empirical formula given by Meisner and Kim. The quantity of gas is determined by the Meisner and Kim formula using the moisture content, volatile content, the volume of methane adsorbed on wet coal, fixed carbon, thickness of coal, and temperature.
Meisner (1984) observed that the amount of methane gas (VCH4) is related to volatile matter (daf).

VCH4 = −325.6 × log (V.M/37.8)

The estimation of the &quot;in situ&quot; gas content of the coal will be evaluated by using Kim&#x27;s (Kim 1977) equation 

V = (100 −M − A) /100 × [ Vw /Vd ] [K(P)N - (b × T)]
Where,
V = Volume of methane gas adsorbed (cc/g) 
M = Moisture content (%) 
A = Ash content (%).
Vw/Vd = 1/(0.25 ×M + 1)
Vw = Volume of gas adsorbed on wet coal (cc/g) 
Vd = Volume of gas adsorbed on dry coal (cc/g)
The values of K and N depend on the rank of the coal and can be expressed in terms of the ratio of fixed carbon (FC) to Volatile matter(VM)
K = 0.8 (F.C /V.M) + 5.6
Where
F.C = Fixed carbon (%)
VM = Volatile matter (%)
N = Composition of coal (for most bituminous coals, N = (0.39 - 0.013 × K)
b =Adsorption constant due to temperature change (cc/g/◦C).
T = Geothermal Gradient × (h/ 100) + To
T = Temperature at a given depth
To = Ground temperature
h = Depth (m)

Estimation of methane content in coal seams by Karol curve

In the absence of measured methane content of coal beds, and production data from coal bed methane wells, gas content can be estimated using the Eddy curve. Eddy and others constructed a series of curves estimating the maximum producible methane content of coal beds as a function of depth and rank.
The estimation of the methane content of a coal bed is determined from the Eddy curve by locating the average depth of each coal seam on the depth axis. A normal line is extended upward from the depth axis (feet) to intersect the specific coal rank curves. A line from the point on the curve is extended normally to the lost and desorbed gas axis (cm3/gm). The intersection of the line and the axis is the estimated methane content of the coal seam.

== Interpretation of Ash analysis ==
Ash is an important indicator of clastic input, derived from marine or fluvial deposition of clay, silt, and sand during peat development. Outcrop ash content appears to be less than the ash content of subsurface samples. Lower ash contents of outcrop samples may be due to coal deposits being up-dip and further away from a marine influence than samples down-dip.

<text>The geography of France consists of a terrain that is mostly flat plains or gently rolling hills in the north and the west and mountainous in the south (including the Massif Central and the Pyrenees) and the east (the country&#x27;s highest points being in the Alps). Metropolitan France has a total size of (Europe only). It is the third-largest country in Europe by area (after Russia and Ukraine) and the largest in Western Europe.

==Physical geography of Metropolitan France==


===Climate===

Metropolitan France&#x27;s territory is relatively large and so it climate is not uniform and gives rise to the following climate nuances:

*The cool semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) is found in the western part of the Bouches-du-Rhône area and the Roussillon plain of the Pyrénées-Orientales. Summers are hot, winters are cool winters. There is insufficient average annual rainfall in some years. 
*The hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) is found along the Gulf of Lion and further inland. Summers are hot and dry, winters are cool and autumns can be very rainy near the Cévennes.
*The warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;) is found in the northwestern part of Brittany and along the Gulf of Lion but higher in altitude, in the mountains. Summers are warm (but not hot) and dry, winters are cool and can be cold in the mountains and autumns are rainy.
*The humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) is found in southwestern France, in the Toulouse area. In France, the humid subtropical climate is not as hot and humid as in the Southeastern United States. Summers are hot and wetter than in the Mediterranean Basin, and winters are cool and somewhat foggy in the plains.
*The oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) concerns a large part of France, as far as Champagne and Burgundy and of course around the coasts of the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel and the North Sea. Summers are pleasantly warm (rarely hot), somewhat dry and winters are cool and wet.
*The subalpine oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;) is found at the foot of the Pyrenees, Massif Central and western French Alps as in the mountains of the Vercors Massif and the Chartreuse Mountains. Summers are short, cool and wet, and winters are moderately cold, long and snowy.
*The warm-summer dry-summer continental climate (&quot;Dsb&quot;) is found in all the mountainous regions of Southern France between 700 and 1,400 metres a.s.l. Summers are pleasantly warm and dry, and winters are very cold and snowy.
*The cool-summer dry-summer continental climate (&quot;Dsc&quot;) is found in all the mountainous regions of Southern France between 1,400 and 2,300-2,400 metres a.s.l. Summers are cool, short and dry, and winters are very cold and snowy.
*The warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) is found in the far east of France or in all the mountain ranges far from the ocean or the sea. Summers are warm to hot and stormy and winters are cold and somewhat dry, and snow is not uncommon. Above 500–600 meters a.s.l in the northeastern quarter of France, the snowpack can persist throughout the winter. In January 1985, in Mouthe, the temperature has dropped under .
*The subalpine climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) is found in all the mountainous regions of France between 1,100-1,400 meters a.s.l in the Vosges mountains and 1,400-2,300 metres a.s.l in the southern French Alps or in the Pyrenees. Summers are cool, short and stormy while winters are very cold, long and snowy.
* The alpine tundra climate (&quot;ET&quot;) is found in all the mountainous regions of France, generally above 2,000 or 2,300-2,400 metres a.s.l depending on the mountain ranges. Summers are chilly, stormy and windy and winters are extremely cold, long and snowy.
* The ice cap climate (&quot;EF&quot;) is found in all the mountainous regions of France that have a glacier, in the highest mountains of the Alps or the Pyrenees. The climate in the Mont Blanc massif (up to 4,810 meters a.s.l) is an ice cap climate for example. Summers are cold and wet and winters are extremely cold, long and snowy.

Climate change in France includes above average heating.

===Elevation extremes===

* Highest point: Mont Blanc 4,808 m 

===Land use===
* &quot;Arable land&quot;: 33.40%
* &quot;Permanent crops&quot;: 1.83%
* &quot;Other&quot;: 64.77% (2007)

&quot;Irrigated land:&quot; 26,420 km2 (2007)

&quot;Total renewable water resources:&quot; 211 km3 (2011)

&quot;Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):&quot; 31.62 km3/yr (19%/71%/10%) (512.1 m3/yr per capita) (2009)

===Natural resources===
Coal, iron ore, bauxite, zinc, uranium, antimony, arsenic, potash, feldspar, fluorspar, gypsum, timber, fish, gold, clay, petroleum, silver

===Natural hazards===
Flooding, Hailstorms, avalanches, midwinter windstorms, drought, forest fires in the south near the Mediterranean

===Environment===
The region that now comprises France consisted of open grassland during the Pleistocene Ice Age. France gradually became forested as the glaciers retreated starting in 10,000 BC, but clearing of these primeval forests began in Neolithic times. These forests were still fairly extensive until the medieval era.

In prehistoric times, France was home to large predatory animals such as wolves and brown bears, as well as herbivores such as elk. The larger fauna have disappeared outside the Pyrenees Mountains where bears live as a protected species. Smaller animals include martens, wild pigs, foxes, weasels, bats, rodents, rabbits, and assorted birds.

By the 15th century, France had largely been denuded of its forests and was forced to rely on Scandinavia and their North American colonies for lumber. Significant remaining forested areas are in the Gascony region and north in the Alsace-Ardennes area. The Ardennes Forest was the scene of extensive fighting in both world wars.

The northcentral part of the region is dominated by the Paris Basin, which consists of a layered sequence of sedimentary rocks. Fertile soils over much of the area make good agricultural land. The Normandy coast to the northwest is characterized by high, chalk cliffs, while the Brittany coast (the peninsula to the west) is highly indented in places that deep valleys were drowned by the sea, and the Biscay coast to the southwest is marked by flat, sandy beaches.

A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 1,433 km2 of tidal flats in France, making it the 23rd ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.

==Political geography==
===Internal divisions===

France has several levels of internal divisions. The first-level administrative division of Metropolitan France is regions. Also the French Republic has sovereignty over several other territories, with various administrative levels. 
*Metropolitan (i.e. European) France is divided into 12 &quot;régions&quot; and 1 territorial collectivity, Corsica. However, Corsica is referred to as a region in common speech. These regions are subdivided into 96 &quot;départements&quot;, which are further divided into 320 arrondissements, which are further divided into 1,995 cantons, which are further divided into 34,836 communes (as of 1/1/2021).
*Five overseas regions (&quot;régions d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;, or &quot;ROM&quot;): Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion, with identical status to metropolitan regions. Each of these overseas regions also being an overseas département (&quot;département d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;, or &quot;DOM&quot;), with the same status as a &#x27; of metropolitan France. This double structure (&quot;région&quot;/&#x27;) is new, due to the recent extension of the regional scheme to the overseas départements, and may soon transform into a single structure, with the merger of the regional and departmental assemblies. Another proposed change is that new &quot;départements&quot; are created such as in the case of Réunion, where it has been proposed to create a second &quot;&quot; in the south of the island, with the &quot;région&quot; of Réunion above these two &quot;départements&quot;.
*Four overseas collectivities (&quot;collectivités d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;, or &quot;COM&quot;): Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, and Wallis and Futuna.

<text>The economy of France is a highly developed social market economy with notable state participation in strategic sectors. It is the world&#x27;s seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP and the ninth-largest economy by PPP, constituting around 4% of world GDP. Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, France&#x27;s GDP as measured in dollars fluctuates sharply, being smaller in 2024 than in 2008. France has a diversified economy, that is dominated by the service sector (which in 2017 represented 78.8% of its GDP), whilst the industrial sector accounted for 19.5% of its GDP and the primary sector accounted for the remaining 1.7%. In 2020, France was the largest Foreign Direct Investment recipient in Europe, and Europe&#x27;s second largest spender in research and development. It was ranked among the 10 most innovative countries in the world by the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index, as well as the 15th most competitive nation globally according to the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report (up 2 notches compared to 2018). It was the fifth-largest trading nation in the world (and second in Europe after Germany). France is also the most visited destination in the world, as well as the European Union&#x27;s leading agricultural power.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in 2023, France was the world&#x27;s 23rd country by GDP per capita with $44,408 per inhabitant. In 2021, France was listed on the United Nations&#x27;s Human Development Index with a value of 0.903 (indicating very high human development) and 22nd on the Corruption Perceptions Index in 2021. Among OECD members, France has a highly efficient and strong social security system, which comprises roughly 31.7% of GDP. 

Paris is a leading global city, and has one of the largest city GDP in the world. It ranks as the first city in Europe (and 3rd worldwide) by the number of companies classified in &quot;Fortune&quot;&#x27;s Fortune Global 500. Paris produced US$738 billion (or US$882 billion at market exchange rates) or around 1/3 of the French economy in 2018 while the economy of the Paris metropolitan area—the largest in Europe with London—generates around 1/3 of France&#x27;s GDP or around $1.0 trillion. Paris has been ranked as the 2nd most attractive global city in the world in 2019 by KPMG. La Défense, Paris&#x27;s Central Business District, was ranked by Ernst &amp; Young in 2017 as the leading business district in continental Europe, and fourth in the world. The OECD is headquartered in Paris, the nation&#x27;s financial capital. The other major economic centres of the country include Lyon, Toulouse (centre of the European aerospace industry), Marseille and Lille.

France&#x27;s economy entered the recession of the late 2000s later and appeared to leave it earlier than most affected economies, only enduring four-quarters of contraction. However, France experienced stagnant growth between 2012 and 2014, with the economy expanding by 0% in 2012, 0.8% in 2013 and 0.2% in 2014. Growth picked up in 2015 with a growth of 0.8%. This was followed by a growth of 1.1% for 2016, a growth of 2.2% for 2017, and a growth of 2.1% for 2018.

According to INSEE (2021), non-financial and non-agricultural medium-sized firms employed 3 million full-time equivalent employees (24.3% of the workforce), accounted for 27% of investment, 30% of turnover, and 26% of value added, despite accounting for only 1.6% of total firms in France.

== Corporations ==
With 31 companies that are part of the world&#x27;s biggest 500 companies, France was in 2020 the most represented European country in the 2020 Fortune Global 500, ahead of Germany (27 companies) and the UK (22).

As of August 2020, France was also the country that weighed the most on the Eurozone&#x27;s EURO STOXX 50 (representing 36.4% of all total assets), ahead of Germany (35.2%).

Several French corporations rank amongst the largest in their industries such as AXA in insurance and Air France in air transportation. Luxury and consumer goods are particularly relevant, with L&#x27;Oreal being the world&#x27;s largest cosmetic company while LVMH and Kering are the world&#x27;s two largest luxury product companies. In energy and utilities, GDF-Suez and EDF are amongst the largest energy companies in the world, and Areva is a large nuclear-energy company; Veolia Environnement is the world&#x27;s largest environmental services and water management company; Vinci SA, Bouygues and Eiffage are large construction companies; Michelin ranks in the top 3 tire manufacturers; JCDecaux is the world&#x27;s largest outdoor advertising corporation; BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Société Générale rank amongst the largest banks in the world by assets. Capgemini and Atos are among the largest technology consulting companies.

Carrefour is the world&#x27;s second-largest retail group in terms of revenue; Total is the world&#x27;s fourth-largest private oil company; Lactalis is the world&#x27;s largest dairy products group; Sanofi is the world&#x27;s fifth-largest pharmaceutical company; Publicis is the world&#x27;s third-largest advertising company; Groupe PSA is the world&#x27;s 6th and Europe&#x27;s 2nd largest automaker; Accor is the leading European hotel group; Alstom is one of the world&#x27;s leading conglomerates in rail transport.

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in France is Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate with 2,656,178 companies followed by Services and Retail Trade with 2,090,320 and 549,395 companies respectively.

== Rise and decline of dirigisme ==
France embarked on an ambitious and very successful programme of modernisation under state coordination. This programme of &quot;dirigisme&quot;, mostly implemented by governments between 1944 and 1983, involved the state control of certain industries such as transportation, energy and telecommunications as well as various incentives for private corporations to merge or engage in certain projects.

The 1981 election of president François Mitterrand saw a short-lived increase in governmental control of the economy, nationalizing many industries and private banks. This form of increased &quot;dirigisme&quot;, was criticised as early as 1982. By 1983, the government decided to renounce &quot;dirigisme&quot; and start an era of rigueur (&quot;rigor&quot;) or corporation. As a result, the government largely retreated from economic intervention; &quot;dirigisme&quot; has now essentially receded, though some of its traits remain. The French economy grew and changed under government direction and planning much more than in other European countries.

Despite being a widely liberalised economy, the government continues to play a significant role in the economy: government spending, at 56% of GDP in 2014, is the second-highest in the European Union. Labor conditions and wages are highly regulated. The government continues to own shares in corporations in several sectors, including energy production and distribution, automobiles, aerospace industry, shipbuilding, the arms industry, electronics industry, machine industry, metallurgy, fuels, chemical industry, transportation, and telecommunications.

== Government finance ==


In April and May 2012, France held a presidential election in which the winner François Hollande had opposed austerity measures, promising to eliminate France&#x27;s budget deficit by 2017. The new government stated that it aimed to cancel recently enacted tax cuts and exemptions for the wealthy, raising the top tax bracket rate to 75% on incomes over a million euros, restoring the retirement age to 60 with a full pension for those who have worked 42 years, restoring 60,000 jobs recently cut from public education, regulating rent increases; and building additional public housing for the poor.

In June 2012, Hollande&#x27;s Socialist Party won an overall majority in the legislative elections, giving it the capability to amend the French Constitution and allowing immediate enactment of the promised reforms. French government bond interest rates fell 30% to record lows, less than 50 basis points above German government bond rates.

Hollande&#x27;s successor as President of France, Emmanuel Macron, a centrist politician, took office in May 2017. His aim was to revive the euro zone’s second-largest economy.

In July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government issued 10-years bonds which had negative interest rates, for the first time in its history (which means that investors buying French bonds will pay, rather than receive, interest for owning French sovereign debt).

France possesses in 2020 the fourth-largest gold reserves in the world.

Macron vowed in May 2023 to build factories, boost job creations and make France more independent, shaked by pension protests.

=== National debt ===

The Government of France has run a budget deficit each year since the early 1970s. As of 2021, French government debt reached an equivalent of 118.6% of French GDP.

Under European Union rules, member states are supposed to limit their debt to 60% of output or be reducing the ratio structurally towards this ceiling, and run public deficits of no more than 3.0% of GDP.

In late 2012, credit-rating agencies warned that growing French government debt levels risked France&#x27;s AAA credit rating, raising the possibility of a future credit downgrade and subsequent higher borrowing costs for the French government. In 2012 France was downgraded by ratings agencies Moody&#x27;s, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s (S&amp;P), and Fitch to an AA+ credit rating.

In December 2014 France&#x27;s credit rating was further downgraded by Fitch and S&amp;P to AA.

Macron, shaken by pension protests, vowed in May 2023 to build factories, boost job creations and make France more independent.

The Government of France experienced a significant shift in its bond market position on September 26, 2024, when its bond yield surpassed that of Spain for the first time since 2007. The yield on 10-year French bonds reached 2.97%, slightly exceeding the yield on Spanish bonds of similar maturity, despite France&#x27;s typically higher credit rating.
This development raised concerns among investors about France&#x27;s ability to manage its public finances effectively. France&#x27;s bond yields were reported to be higher than those of Portugal and approaching levels seen in Italy and Greece, countries traditionally viewed as having higher economic risks in the Eurozone.

Furthermore, France faces a budget crisis in 2024, with the deficit at risk of exceeding 6% of GDP, significantly higher than the previous government&#x27;s estimate of 5.1%. Newly appointed Finance Minister Antoine Armand and Budget Minister Laurent Saint-Martin pledged to focus on spending cuts before considering tax increases to address the fiscal shortfall. Prime Minister Michel Barnier was tasked with finalizing the 2025 budget within days, amidst pressure to present realistic plans for deficit reduction.

== Data ==

The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022–2027). Inflation below 5% is in green.

== Economic sectors ==

=== Industry ===

In 2019, France was the world&#x27;s 8th largest manufacturer in terms of value added, according to the World Bank.

The leading industrial sectors in France are telecommunications (including communication satellites), aerospace and defence, ship building, pharmaceuticals, construction and civil engineering, chemicals, textiles, and automobile production. The chemical industry is a key sector for France, helping to develop other manufacturing activities and contributing to economic growth.

Research and development spending is also high in France at 2.26% of GDP, the fourth-highest in the OECD.

Industry contributes to French exports: as of 2018, the Observatory of Economic Complexity estimates that France&#x27;s largest exports &quot;are led by planes, helicopters, and spacecraft ($43.8 billion), cars ($26 billion), packaged medicaments ($25.7 billion), vehicle parts ($16.5 billion), and gas turbines ($14.4 billion).&quot;

In December 2023, industrial production in France experienced its most significant change since May of the same year, with a notable increase of 1.1%.

===Energy===

France is the world-leading country in nuclear energy, home of global energy giants Areva, EDF and GDF Suez: nuclear power now accounts for about 78% of the country&#x27;s electricity production, up from only 8% in 1973, 24% in 1980, and 75% in 1990. Nuclear waste is stored on site at reprocessing facilities. Due to its heavy investment in nuclear power, France is the smallest emitter of carbon dioxide among the seven most industrialised countries in the world. Due to its overwhelming reliance on nuclear power, renewable energies have seen relatively little growth compared to other Western countries.

In 2006, electricity generated in France amounted to 548.8 TWh, of which:
*428.7 TWh (78.1%) were produced by nuclear power generation
*60.9 TWh (11.1%) were produced by hydroelectric power generation
*52.4 TWh (9.5%) were produced by fossil-fuel power generation
**21.6 TWh (3.9%) by coal power
**20.9 TWh (3.8%) by natural-gas power
**9.9 TWh (1.8%) by other fossil fuel generation (fuel oil and gases by-products of industry such as blast furnace gases)
*6.9 TWh (1.3%) were produced by other types of power generation (essentially waste-to-energy and wind turbines)
**The electricity produced by wind turbines increased from 0.596 TWh in 2004, to 0.963 TWh in 2005, and 2.15 TWh in 2006, but this still accounted only for 0.4% of the total production of electricity (as of 2006).

In November 2004, EDF (which stands for Electricité de France), one of the world&#x27;s largest utility company and France&#x27;s largest electricity provider, was floated with huge success on the French stock market. However, the French state still retains 70% of the capital. Other electricity providers include Compagnie nationale du Rhône (CNR) and Endesa (through SNET).

=== Agriculture ===
France is the world&#x27;s sixth largest agricultural producer and EU&#x27;s leading agricultural power, accounting for about one-third of all agricultural land within the EU. In the early 1980s, France was the leading producer of the three principal grains of wheat, barley, and maize. Back in 1983, France produced around 24.8 million tonnes, ahead of the United Kingdom and West Germany, the next two largest wheat producers.

Northern France is characterised by large wheat farms. Dairy products, pork, poultry, and apple production are concentrated in the western region. Beef production is located in central France, while the production of fruits, vegetables, and wine ranges from central to southern France. France is a large producer of many agricultural products and is currently expanding its forestry and fishery industries. The implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have resulted in reforms in the agricultural sector of the economy.

As the world&#x27;s second-largest agricultural exporter, France ranks just after the United States. The destination of 49% of its exports is other EU members states. France also provides agricultural exports to many poor African countries (including its former colonies) which face serious food shortages. Wheat, beef, pork, poultry, and dairy products are the principal exports.

Exports from the United States face stiff competition from domestic production, other EU member states, and third-world countries in France. US agricultural exports to France, totaling some $600 million annually, consist primarily of soybeans and soybean products, feeds and fodders, seafood, and consumer products, especially snack foods and nuts. French exports to the United States are much more high-value products such as its cheese, processed products and its wine.

The French agricultural sector receives almost €11 billion in EU subsidies. France produced in 2018 39.5 million tons of sugar beet (2nd largest producer in the world, just behind Russia), which serves to produce sugar and ethanol; 35.8 million tons of wheat (5th largest producer in the world); 12.6 million tons of maize (11th largest producer in the world); 11.2 million tons of barley (2nd largest producer in the world, only behind Russia); 7.8 million tons of potato (8th largest producer in the world); 6.2 million tons of grape (5th largest producer in the world); 4.9 million tons of rapeseed (4th largest producer in the world, behind Canada, China and India); 2.2 million tons of sugarcane; 1.7 million tons of apple (9th largest producer in the world); 1.3 million tons of triticale (4th largest producer in the world, only behind Poland, Germany and Belarus); 1.2 million tons of sunflower seed (9th largest producer in the world); 712 thousand tons of tomatoes; 660 thousand tons of linen; 615 thousand tons of dry pea; 535 thousand tons of carrot; 427 thousand tons of oats; 400 thousand tons of soy; in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

=== Tourism ===

France is the world&#x27;s most popular tourist destination with more than 83.7 million foreign tourists in 2014, ahead of Spain (58.5 million in 2006) and the United States (51.1 million in 2006). This figure excludes people staying less than 24 hours in France, such as northern Europeans crossing France on their way to Spain or Italy during the summer.

According to figures from 2003, some popular tourist sites include (in visitors per year): Eiffel Tower (6.2 million), Louvre Museum (5.7 million), Palace of Versailles (2.8 million), Cité des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie (2.6 million), Musée d&#x27;Orsay (2.1 million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2 million), Centre Pompidou (1.2 million), Mont-Saint-Michel (1 million), Château de Chambord (711,000), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg (549,000), Puy de Dôme (500,000), Musée Picasso (441,000), Carcassonne (362,000). However, the most popular site in France is Disneyland Paris, with 9.7 million visitors in 2017

=== Arms industry ===

The French government is the French arms industry&#x27;s main customer, mainly buying warships, guns, nuclear weapons and equipment.

During the 2000–2015 period, France was the fourth largest weapons exporter in the world.

French manufacturers export great quantities of weaponry to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Greece, India, Pakistan, Taiwan, Singapore and many others. It was reported that in 2015, French arms sales internationally amounted to 17.4 billion U.S. dollars, more than double the figure of 2014.
=== Fashion and luxury goods ===
According to 2017 data compiled by Deloitte, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales, selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor. Moreover, France also possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales (LVMH, Kering SA, L&#x27;Oréal), more than any other country in the world.

Paris is considered one of the world&#x27;s foremost fashion capitals, or even &quot;the world&#x27;s fashion capital&quot;. The French tradition for haute couture has been estimated to start as early as the era of Louis XIV, the Sun King.

=== Education ===

Education in France is organised in a highly centralised manner, with many subdivisions. It is divided into the three stages of primary education (&quot;enseignement primaire&quot;), secondary education (&quot;enseignement secondaire&quot;), and higher education (&quot;enseignement supérieur&quot;). In French higher education, the following degrees are recognised by the Bologna Process (EU recognition): &quot;Licence&quot; and &quot;Licence Professionnelle&quot; (bachelor&#x27;s degrees), and the comparably named &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Doctorat&quot; degrees.

The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of French 15-year-olds as 26th in the world in reading literacy, mathematics, and science, near the OECD average of 493. France&#x27;s performance in mathematics and science at the middle school level was ranked 23 in the 1995 Trends in International Math and Science Study. The OECD also found that students in France reported greater concern about discipline and behaviour at school and in classrooms, much more than the rest of Europe. This was higher than all OECD countries. School principals reported higher staff and material shortage in France, higher than OECD averages. About 7% of French teachers believe the teaching profession is highly valued in France and in society. School principals noted regular acts of violence/ bullying among their students, higher than averages. The time spent of teaching time spent on keeping classes in good order is one of the largest in France, among all OECD countries studied. France also has a high drop out rate. 

Pupils can take apprenticeships to enter the labour market with the Baccalauréat Technologique. It allows pupils pursue short and technical studies (laboratory, design and applied arts, hotel and restaurant, management etc).

Higher education in France was reshaped by the student revolts of May 1968. During the 1960s, French public universities responded to a massive explosion in the number of students (280,000 in 1962–63 to 500,000 in 1967–68) by stuffing approximately one-third of their students into hastily developed campus annexes (roughly equivalent to American satellite campuses) which lacked decent amenities, resident professors, academic traditions, or the dignity of university status. This is why the French higher education economy performs poorly compared with other high-performing countries such as England or Australia. France also hosts various catholic universities recognised by the state, the largest one being Lille Catholic University, as well branch colleges of foreign universities. They include Baruch College, the University of London Institute in Paris, Parsons Paris School of Art and Design and the American University of Paris. Eighteen million pupils and students are in the education system, over 2.4 million of whom are in higher education.

=== Transport ===


Transportation in France relies on one of the densest networks in the world with 146 km of road and 6.2 km of rail lines per 100 km2. It is built as a web with Paris at its centre. The highly subsidised rail transport network makes up a relatively small portion of travel, most of which is done by car. However, the high-speed TGV trains make up a large proportion of long-distance travel, partially because intercity buses were prevented from operating until 2015.

With 3,220 kilometers of high-speed train lines, France boast the 2nd most expansive network in the world, only after China. Charles de Gaulle Airport is one of the busiest airports in the world by passenger traffic. Charles de Gaulle airport is third globally in the number of destinations served, and first in the number of countries served with non-stop flights.

France also boasts a number of seaports and harbours, including Bayonne, Bordeaux, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Brest, Calais, Cherbourg-Octeville, Dunkerque, Fos-sur-Mer, La Pallice, Le Havre, Lorient, Marseille, Nantes, Nice, Paris, Port-la-Nouvelle, Port-Vendres, Roscoff, Rouen, Saint-Nazaire, Saint-Malo, Sète, Strasbourg and Toulon. There are approximately 470 airports in France and by a 2005 estimate, there are three heliports. 288 of the airports have paved runways, with the remaining 199 being unpaved. The national carrier of France is Air France, a full service global airline which flies to 20 domestic destinations and 150 international destinations in 83 countries (including Overseas France) across all 6 major continents.

== Foreign investment==

According to a study conducted by Ernst &amp; Young, France was in 2020 the largest Foreign Direct Investment recipient in Europe, ahead of the UK and Germany. EY attributed this as a &quot;direct result of President Macron’s reforms of labor laws and corporate taxation, which were well received by domestic and international investors alike.&quot;

France scored 5th in the 2019 AT Kearney FDI Confidence Index, up 2 notches from its 2017 ranking.

==Labour market==
According to a 2011 report by the American Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), France&#x27;s GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is similar to that of the UK, with just over US$35,000 per head. To explain why French per capita GDP is lower than that of the United States, the economist Paul Krugman stated that &quot;French workers are roughly as productive as US workers&quot;, but that the French have a &quot;lower workforce participation rate,&quot; and &quot;when they work, they work fewer hours&quot;. According to Krugman, the difference is due to the French making &quot;different choices about retirement and leisure&quot;.

France has long suffered a relatively high unemployment rate, even during the years when its macroeconomic performances compared favourably with other advanced economies. French employment rates for the working age population is one of the lowest of the OECD countries: in 2020, only 64.4% of the French working age population were in employment, compared to 77% in Japan, 76.1% in Germany, 75.4% in the UK, but the French employment rate was higher than that of the US, which stood at 62.5%. This gap is due to the low employment rate for 15–24 years old: 38% in 2012, compared to 47% in the OECD.

Since his election in 2017, Emmanuel Macron has introduced several labour market reforms which proved successful in decreasing the unemployment rate before the global COVID-19 recession struck. In late 2019, the French unemployment rate, though still high compared to other developed economies, was the lowest in a decade.

During the 2000s and 2010s, classical liberal and Keynesian economists sought out different solutions to the unemployment issue in France. Keynesian economists&#x27;s theories led to the introduction of the 35-hour workweek law in 1999. Between 2004 and 2008, the government attempted to combat unemployment with supply-side reforms, but was met with fierce resistance; the &quot;contrat nouvelle embauche&quot; and the &quot;contrat première embauche&quot; (which allowed more flexible contracts) were of particular concern, and both were eventually repealed. The Sarkozy government used the &quot;revenu de solidarité active&quot; (in-work benefits) to redress the &quot;negative effect&quot; of the &quot;revenu minimum d&#x27;insertion&quot; (unemployment benefits which do not depend on previous contributions, unlike normal unemployment benefits in France) on the incentive to accept even jobs which are insufficient to earn a living. Neoliberal economists attribute the low employment rate, particularly evident among young people, to high minimum wages that would prevent low productivity workers from easily entering the labour market.

A December 2012 &quot;New York Times&quot; article reported on a &quot;floating generation&quot; in France that formed part of the 14 million unemployed young Europeans documented by the Eurofound research agency. This &quot;floating generation&quot; was attributed to a dysfunctional system: &quot;an elitist educational tradition that does not integrate graduates into the work force, a rigid labour market that is hard to enter for newcomers, and a tax system that makes it expensive for companies to hire full-time employees and both difficult and expensive to lay them off&quot;. In July 2013, the unemployment rate for France was 11%.

In early April 2014, employers&#x27; federations and unions negotiated an agreement with technology and consultancy employers, as employees had been experiencing an extension of their work time through smartphone communication outside of official working hours. Under a new, legally binding labour agreement, around 250,000 employees will avoid handling work-related matters during their leisure time and their employers will, in turn, refrain from engaging with staff during this time.

Every day, about 80,000 French citizens are commuting to work in neighbouring Luxembourg, making it the biggest cross-border workforce group in the whole of the European Union. They are attracted by much higher wages for the different job groups than in their own country and the lack of skilled labour in the booming Luxembourgish economy.

The background of the 2023 pension reform was about 14% of GDP pension spending in France compared to OECD average of just over 9%. The aim of the pension reform was to reduce cost by increasing the minimum legal retirement age from 62 years to 64 years in 2030. In April 2023, president Emmanuel Macron signed the pension reforms into law.

== External trade ==
In 2018, France was the 5th largest trading nation in the world, as well as the second-largest trading nation in Europe (after Germany). Its foreign trade balance for goods had been in surplus from 1992 until 2001, reaching $25.4 billion (25.4 G$) in 1998; however, the French balance of trade was hit by the economic downturn, and went into the red in 2000, reaching a US$15bn deficit in 2003. Total trade for 1998 amounted to $730 billion, or 50% of GDP—imports plus exports of goods and services. Trade with European Union countries accounts for 60% of French trade.

In 1998, US–France trade stood at about $47 billion – goods only. According to French trade data, US exports accounted for 8.7% – about $25 billion – of France&#x27;s total imports. US industrial chemicals, aircraft and engines, electronic components, telecommunications, computer software, computers and peripherals, analytical and scientific instrumentation, medical instruments and supplies, broadcasting equipment, and programming and franchising are particularly attractive to French importers.

The principal French exports to the US are aircraft and engines, beverages, electrical equipment, chemicals, cosmetics, luxury products and perfume. France is the ninth-largest trading partner of the US.

In August 2023, the French current account deficit shrank by €29.7 billion in the past six months, from −€39.3 billion to −€9.6 billion, primarily due to a fall in energy prices.

==Regional economy==


The economic disparity between French regions is not as high as that in other European countries such as the UK, Italy or Germany, and higher than in countries like Sweden or Denmark, or even Spain. However, Europe&#x27;s wealthiest and second largest regional economy, Ile-de-France (the region surrounding Paris), has long profited from the capital city&#x27;s economic hegemony.

The most important &quot;régions&quot; are Île-de-France (Europe&#x27;s 4th regional economy), Rhône-Alpes (Europe&#x27;s 5th largest regional economy thanks to its services, high-technologies, chemical industries, wines, tourism), Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur (services, industry, tourism and wines), Nord-Pas-de-Calais (European transport hub, services, industries) and Pays de la Loire (green technologies, tourism). Regions like Alsace, which has a rich past in industry (machine tool) and currently stands as a high income service-specialised region, are very wealthy without ranking very high in absolute terms.

The rural areas are mainly in Auvergne, Limousin, and Centre-Val de Loire, and wine production accounts for a significant proportion of the economy in Aquitaine (Bordeaux (or claret)), Burgundy, and champagne produced in Champagne-Ardennes.

==Departments economy and cities==

=== Departmental income inequalities ===

In terms of income, important inequalities can be observed among the French départements.

According to the 2008 statistics of the INSEE, the Yvelines is the highest income department of the country with an average income of €4,750 per month. Hauts-de-Seine comes second, Essonne third, Paris fourth, Seine-et Marne fifth. Île-de-France is the wealthiest region in the country with an average income of €4,228 per month (and is also the wealthiest region in Europe) compared to €3,081 at the national level. Alsace comes second, Rhône-Alpes third, Picardy fourth, and Upper Normandy fifth.

The poorest parts of France are the French overseas departments, French Guiana being the poorest department with an average household income of €1,826. In Metropolitan France it is Creuse in the Limousin region which comes bottom of the list with an average household income of €1,849 per month.

=== Urban income inequalities ===
Huge inequalities can also be found among cities.
In the Paris metropolitan area, significant differences exist between the higher standard of living of &quot;Paris Ouest&quot; and lower standard of living in areas in the northern &quot;banlieues&quot; of Paris such as Seine-Saint-Denis.

For cities of over 50,000 inhabitants, Neuilly-sur-Seine, a western suburb of Paris, is the wealthiest city in France with an average household income of €5,939, and 35% earning more than €8,000 per month.
But within Paris, four arrondissements surpass wealthy Neuilly-sur-Seine in household income: the 6th, the 7th, the 8th and the 16th; the 8th arrondissement being the wealthiest district in France (the other three following it closely as 2nd, 3rd and 4th wealthiest ones).

== Poverty ==
OECD data from 2021 estimate that 8.4% of the French population lived in poverty, compared with 18% in the United States, 11.6% in Canada, and 9.8% in Germany. In 2016, the poverty rate in France stood at 14%, compared to 12.8% in 2004. The northern districts of Marseille represent one of the poorest and unequal areas in France, where poor neighbourhoods rub shoulders with wealthier pockets. The share of people living below the poverty line (949 euro per month) was 28.8% in 2008 in sensitive urban zones (ZUS) compared to 12% in the rest of the territory.

In comparison with the average French workers, foreign workers tended to be employed in the hardest and lowest-paid jobs. They also live in poor conditions. A 1972 study found that foreign workers earned 17% less than their French counterparts, although this national average concealed the extent of inequality. Foreign workers were more likely to be men in their prime working years in the industrial areas, which generally had higher rates of pay than elsewhere.

== Wealth ==

=== Overview ===
In 2010, the French had an estimated wealth of US$14.0 trillion for a population of 63 million.

*In terms of aggregate wealth, the French are the wealthiest Europeans, accounting for more than a quarter of wealthiest European households. Globally, the French nation ranks fourth-wealthiest.
*In 2010, wealth per French adult was a little higher than $290,000, down from a pre-crisis high of $300,000 in 2007. According to this ratio, the French are the wealthiest in Europe. The wealth tax is paid by 1.1 million people in France. Liability to this tax starts from €1.3 million of assets. (There is a discount on the principal residence value.)
*Almost every French household has at least $1,000 in assets. Proportionally, there are twice as many French with assets of over $10,000 and four times as many French with assets of over $100,000 than the world average.

=== Millionaires ===
France has the third-highest number of millionaires in Europe as of 2017. There were 1.617 million millionaire households (measured in US dollars) living in France in 2017, behind the UK (2.225 million) and Germany (1.637 million).

The wealthiest man in France is the LVMH CEO and owner Bernard Arnault.

By 2022, the combined wealth of France&#x27;s 500 richest people will be worth 1,170 billion euros, or 45% of GDP. In 2009, this figure was just 194 billion, representing 10% of GDP at the time.
