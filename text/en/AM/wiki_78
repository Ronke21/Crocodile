<text>A nonprofit organization (NPO), also known as a nonbusiness entity, nonprofit institution, or simply a nonprofit, is a non-governmental (private) legal entity organized and operated for a collective, public or social benefit, as opposed to an entity that operates as a business aiming to generate a profit for its owners. A nonprofit organization is subject to the non-distribution constraint: any revenues that exceed expenses must be committed to the organization&#x27;s purpose, not taken by private parties. Depending on the local laws, charities are regularly organized as non-profits. A host of organizations may be nonprofit, including some political organizations, schools, hospitals, business associations, churches, foundations, social clubs, and consumer cooperatives. Nonprofit entities may seek approval from governments to be tax-exempt, and some may also qualify to receive tax-deductible contributions, but an entity may incorporate as a nonprofit entity without having tax-exempt status.

Key aspects of nonprofits are their ability to fulfill their mission with respect to accountability, integrity, trustworthiness, honesty, and openness to every person who has invested time, money, and faith into the organization. Nonprofit organizations are accountable to the donors, founders, volunteers, program recipients, and the public community. Theoretically, for a nonprofit that seeks to finance its operations through donations, public confidence is a factor in the amount of money that a nonprofit organization is able to raise. Presumably, the more a nonprofit focuses on their mission, the more public confidence they will gain. This will result in more money for the organization. The activities a nonprofit is partaking in can help build the public&#x27;s confidence in nonprofits, as well as how ethical the standards and practices are.

There is an important distinction in the US between and (NFPOs); while an NFPO does not profit its owners, and money goes into running the organization, it is not required to operate for the public good. An example is a sports club, whose purpose is its members&#x27; enjoyment. The names used and precise regulations vary from one jurisdiction to another.

== Fundraising ==

Nonprofit organizations are not driven by generating profit, but they must bring in enough income to pursue their social goals. Nonprofits are able to raise money in different ways. This includes income from donations from individual donors or foundations; sponsorship from corporations; government funding; programs, services or merchandise sales, and investments. Each NPO is unique in which source of income works best for them. With an increase in NPOs since 2010, organizations have adopted competitive advantages to create revenue for themselves to remain financially stable. Donations from private individuals or organizations can change each year and government grants have diminished. With changes in funding from year to year, many nonprofit organizations have been moving toward increasing the diversity of their funding sources. For example, many nonprofits that have relied on government grants have started fundraising efforts to appeal to individual donors.

== Management ==
Most nonprofits have staff that work for the company, possibly using volunteers to perform the nonprofit&#x27;s services under the direction of the paid staff. Nonprofits must be careful to balance the salaries paid to staff against the money paid to provide services to the nonprofit&#x27;s beneficiaries. Organizations whose salary expenses are too high relative to their program expenses may face regulatory scrutiny.

A second misconception is that nonprofit organizations may not make a profit. Although the goal of nonprofits is not specifically to maximize profits, they still have to operate as a fiscally responsible business. They must manage their income (both grants and donations, and income from services) and expenses so as to remain a fiscally viable entity. Nonprofits have the responsibility of focusing on being professional and financially responsible, replacing self-interest and profit motive with mission motive.

Though nonprofits are managed differently from for-profit businesses, they have felt pressure to be more businesslike. To combat private and public business growth in the public service industry, nonprofits have modeled their business management and mission, shifting their reason of existing to establish sustainability and growth.

Setting effective missions is a key for the successful management of nonprofit organizations. There are three important conditions for effective mission: opportunity, competence, and commitment.

One way of managing the sustainability of nonprofit organizations is to establish strong relations with donor groups. This requires a donor marketing strategy, something many nonprofits lack.

==Functions==
Nonprofit organizations provide public goods that are undersupplied by government. NPOs have a wide diversity of structures and purposes. For legal classification, there are, nevertheless, some elements of importance:
* Management provisions
* Accountability and auditing provisions
* Provisory for the amendment of the statutes or articles of incorporation
* Provisions for the dissolution of the entity
* Tax statuses of corporate and private donors
* Tax status of the founders

Some of the above must be (in most jurisdictions in the US at least) expressed in the organization&#x27;s charter of establishment or constitution. Others may be provided by the supervising authority at each particular jurisdiction.

While affiliations will not affect a legal status, they may be taken into consideration by legal proceedings as an indication of purpose. Most countries have laws that regulate the establishment and management of NPOs and that require compliance with corporate governance regimes. Most larger organizations are required to publish their financial reports detailing their income and expenditure publicly.

In many aspects, they are similar to corporate business entities though there are often significant differences. Both not-for-profit and for-profit corporate entities must have board members, steering-committee members, or trustees who owe the organization a fiduciary duty of loyalty and trust. A notable exception to this involves churches, which are often not required to disclose finances to anyone, including church members.

===Formation and structure===
In the United States, nonprofit organizations are formed by filing bylaws, articles of incorporation, or both in the state in which they expect to operate. The act of incorporation creates a legal entity enabling the organization to be treated as a distinct body (corporation) by law and to enter into business dealings, form contracts, and own property as individuals or for-profit corporations can.

Nonprofits can have members, but many do not. The nonprofit may also be a trust or association of members. The organization may be controlled by its members who elect the board of directors, board of governors or board of trustees. A nonprofit may have a delegate structure to allow for the representation of groups or corporations as members. Alternatively, it may be a non-membership organization and the board of directors may elect its own successors.

The two major types of nonprofit organization are membership and board-only. A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws. A board-only organization typically has a self-selected board and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board. A board-only organization&#x27;s bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization&#x27;s literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as &#x27;members&#x27;; examples of such organizations are FairVote and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act imposes many complexities and requirements on membership decision-making. Accordingly, many organizations, such as the Wikimedia Foundation, have formed board-only structures. The National Association of Parliamentarians has generated concerns about the implications of this trend for the future of openness, accountability, and understanding of public concerns in nonprofit organizations. Specifically, they note that nonprofit organizations, unlike business corporations, are not subject to market discipline for products and shareholder discipline of their capital; therefore, without membership control of major decisions such as the election of the board, there are few inherent safeguards against abuse. A rebuttal to this might be that as nonprofit organizations grow and seek larger donations, the degree of scrutiny increases, including expectations of audited financial statements. A further rebuttal might be that NPOs are constrained, by their choice of legal structure, from financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to members and directors is concerned.

===Tax exemption===
In many countries, nonprofits may apply for tax-exempt status, so that the organization itself may be exempt from income tax and other taxes. In the United States, to be exempt from federal income taxes, the organization must meet the requirements set forth in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Granting nonprofit status is done by the state, while granting tax-exempt designation (such as IRC 501(c)) is granted by the federal government via the IRS. This means that not all nonprofits are eligible to be tax-exempt. For example, employees of non-profit organizations pay taxes from their salaries, which they receive according to the laws of the country. NPOs use the model of a double bottom line in that furthering their cause is more important than making a profit, though both are needed to ensure the organization&#x27;s sustainability. An advantage of nonprofits registered in the UK is that they benefit from some reliefs and exemptions. Charities and nonprofits are exempt from Corporation Tax as well as the trustees being exempt from Income Tax. There may also be tax relief available for charitable giving, via Gift Aid, monetary donations, and legacies.

== In United States ==

According to the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), there are more than 1.5 million nonprofit organizations registered in the United States, including public charities, private foundations, and other nonprofit organizations. Private charitable contributions increased for the fourth consecutive year in 2017 (since 2014), at an estimated $410.02 billion. Out of these contributions, religious organizations received 30.9%, education organizations received 14.3%, and human services organizations received 12.1%. Between September 2010 and September 2014, approximately 25.3% of Americans over the age of 16 volunteered for a nonprofit.

In the United States, both nonprofit organizations and are tax-exempt. There are various types of nonprofit exemptions, such as 501(c)(3) organizations that are a religious, charitable, or educational-based organization that does not influence state and federal legislation, and 501(c)(7) organizations that are for pleasure, recreation, or another nonprofit purpose.

There is an important distinction in the US between and (NFPOs); while an NFPO does not profit its owners, and money goes into running the organization, it is not required to operate for the public good. An example is a club, whose purpose is its members&#x27; enjoyment. Other examples of NFPOs include: credit unions, sports clubs, and advocacy groups. Nonprofit organizations provide services to the community; for example aid and development programs, medical research, education, and health services. It is possible for a nonprofit to be both member-serving and community-serving.

== Online presence ==
When selecting a domain name, NPOs often use one of the following: .org, the country code top-level domain of their respective country, or the .edu top-level domain (TLD), to differentiate themselves from more commercial entities, which typically use .com.

In the traditional domain noted in , .org is for &quot;organizations that didn&#x27;t fit anywhere else&quot; in the naming system, which implies that it is the proper category for non-commercial organizations if they are not governmental, educational, or one of the other types with a specific TLD. It is not designated specifically for charitable organizations or any specific organizational or tax-law status, but encompasses anything that is not classifiable as another category. Currently, no restrictions are enforced on registration of .com or .org, so one can find organizations of all sorts in either of those domains, as well as other top-level domains including newer, more specific ones which may apply to particular sorts of organization including .museum for museums and .coop for cooperatives. Organizations might also register by the appropriate country code top-level domain for their country.

In 2020, nonprofit organizations began using microvlogging (brief videos with short text formats) on TikTok to reach Gen Z, engage with community stakeholders, and overall build community. TikTok allowed for innovative engagement between nonprofit organizations and younger generations. During COVID-19, TikTok was specifically used to connect rather than inform or fundraise, as its fast-paced, tailored For You Page separates itself from other social media apps such as Facebook and Twitter. 

== Alternative names ==
Some organizations offer new, positive-sounding alternative terminology to describe the sector. The term &quot;civil society organization&quot; (CSO) has been used by a growing number of organizations, including the &quot;Center for the Study of Global Governance&quot;. The term &quot;citizen sector organization&quot; (CSO) has also been advocated to describe the sector – as one of citizens, for citizens – by organizations including . Advocates argue that these terms describe the sector in its own terms, without relying on terminology used for the government or business sectors. However, use of terminology by a nonprofit of self-descriptive language that is not legally compliant risks confusing the public about nonprofit abilities, capabilities, and limitations.

== Criticism ==

=== Founder&#x27;s syndrome ===

Founder&#x27;s syndrome is an issue organizations experience as they expand. Dynamic founders, who have a strong vision of how to operate the project, try to retain control of the organization, even as new employees or volunteers want to expand the project&#x27;s scope or change policy.

=== Financial mismanagement ===
Financial mismanagement is a particular problem with NPOs because the employees are not accountable to anyone who has a direct stake in the organization. For example, an employee may start a new program without disclosing its complete liabilities. The employee may be rewarded for improving the NPO&#x27;s reputation, making other employees happy, and attracting new donors. Liabilities promised on the full faith and credit of the organization but not recorded anywhere constitute accounting fraud. But even indirect liabilities negatively affect the financial sustainability of the NPO, and the NPO will have financial problems unless strict controls are instated. Some commenters have argued that the receipt of significant funding from large for-profit corporations can ultimately alter the NPO&#x27;s functions. A frequent measure of an NPO&#x27;s efficiency is its expense ratio (i.e. expenditures on things other than its programs, divided by its total expenditures). Tax exempt status of NPOs can result in some cases, such as mismanagement, in negative value for society.

=== Lower wages ===
There are reports of major labour shortages in the nonprofit sector today, particularly for management positions. While many established NPOs are well-funded and comparative to their public sector competitors, many more are independent and must be creative with which incentives they use to attract and maintain people. The initial interest for many is the remuneration package, though many who have been questioned after leaving an NPO have reported that it was stressful work environments and the workload.

Public- and private-sector employment have, for the most part, been able to offer more to their employees than most nonprofit agencies throughout history. Either in the form of higher wages, more comprehensive benefit packages, or less tedious work, the public and private sectors have enjoyed an advantage over NPOs in attracting employees. Traditionally, the NPO has attracted mission-driven individuals who want to assist their chosen cause. Compounding the issue is that some NPOs do not operate in a manner similar to most businesses, or only seasonally. This leads many young and driven employees to forego NPOs in favor of more stable employment. Today, however, nonprofit organizations are adopting methods used by their competitors and finding new means to retain their employees and attract the best of the newly minted workforce.

One article states that most nonprofits will never be able to match the pay of the private sector and therefore should focus their attention on benefits packages, incentives and implementing pleasurable work environments. A good environment is ranked higher than salary and pressure of work. NPOs are encouraged to pay as much as they are able and offer a low-stress work environment that the employee can associate him or herself positively with. Other incentives that should be implemented are generous vacation allowances or flexible work hours.

<doc id="72489" wikidata="Q902328" url="?curid=72489" title="Electron energy loss spectroscopy">
<text>Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is a form of electron microscopy in which a material is exposed to a beam of electrons with a known, narrow range of kinetic energies. Some of the electrons will undergo inelastic scattering, which means that they lose energy and have their paths slightly and randomly deflected. The amount of energy loss can be measured via an electron spectrometer and interpreted in terms of what caused the energy loss. Inelastic interactions include phonon excitations, inter- and intra-band transitions, plasmon excitations, inner shell ionizations, and Cherenkov radiation. The inner-shell ionizations are particularly useful for detecting the elemental components of a material. For example, one might find that a larger-than-expected number of electrons comes through the material with 285 eV less energy than they had when they entered the material. This is approximately the amount of energy needed to remove an inner-shell electron from a carbon atom, which can be taken as evidence that there is a significant amount of carbon present in the sample. With some care, and looking at a wide range of energy losses, one can determine the types of atoms, and the numbers of atoms of each type, being struck by the beam. The scattering angle (that is, the amount that the electron&#x27;s path is deflected) can also be measured, giving information about the dispersion relation of whatever material excitation caused the inelastic scattering.

==History==
The technique was developed by James Hillier and RF Baker in the mid-1940s but was not widely used over the next 50 years, only becoming more widespread in research in the 1990s due to advances in microscope instrumentation and vacuum technology. With modern instrumentation becoming widely available in laboratories worldwide, the technical and scientific developments from the mid-1990s have been rapid. The technique is able to take advantage of modern aberration-corrected probe forming systems to attain spatial resolutions down to ~0.1 nm, while with a monochromated electron source and/or careful deconvolution the energy resolution can reach units of meV. This has enabled detailed measurements of the atomic and electronic properties of single columns of atoms, and in a few cases, of single atoms.

==Comparison with EDX==
EELS is spoken of as being complementary to energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (variously called EDX, EDS, XEDS, etc.), which is another common spectroscopy technique available on many electron microscopes. EDX excels at identifying the atomic composition of a material, is quite easy to use, and is particularly sensitive to heavier elements. EELS has historically been a more difficult technique but is in principle capable of measuring atomic composition, chemical bonding, valence and conduction band electronic properties, surface properties, and element-specific pair distance distribution functions. EELS tends to work best at relatively low atomic numbers, where the excitation edges tend to be sharp, well-defined, and at experimentally accessible energy losses (the signal being very weak beyond about 3 keV energy loss). EELS is perhaps best developed for the elements ranging from carbon through the 3d transition metals (from scandium to zinc). For carbon, an experienced spectroscopist can tell at a glance the differences between diamond, graphite, amorphous carbon, and &quot;mineral&quot; carbon (such as the carbon appearing in carbonates). The spectra of 3d transition metals can be analyzed to identify the oxidation states of the atoms. Cu(I), for instance, has a different so-called &quot;white-line&quot; intensity ratio than Cu(II) does. This ability to &quot;fingerprint&quot; different forms of the same element is a strong advantage of EELS over EDX. The difference is mainly due to the difference in energy resolution between the two techniques (~1 eV or better for EELS, perhaps a few tens of eV for EDX).

==Variants==

There are several basic flavors of EELS, primarily classified by the geometry and by the kinetic energy of the incident electrons (typically measured in kiloelectron-volts, or keV). Probably the most common today is transmission EELS, in which the kinetic energies are typically 100 to 300 keV and the incident electrons pass entirely through the material sample. Usually this occurs in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), although some dedicated systems exist which enable extreme resolution in terms of energy and momentum transfer at the expense of spatial resolution.

Other flavors include reflection EELS (including reflection high-energy electron energy-loss spectroscopy (RHEELS)), typically at 10 to 30 keV, and aloof EELS (sometimes called near-field EELS), in which the electron beam does not in fact strike the sample but instead interacts with it via the long-ranged Coulomb interaction. Aloof EELS is particularly sensitive to surface properties but is limited to very small energy losses such as those associated with surface plasmons or direct interband transitions.

Within transmission EELS, the technique is further subdivided into valence EELS (which measures plasmons and interband transitions) and inner-shell ionization EELS (which provides much the same information as x-ray absorption spectroscopy, but from much smaller volumes of material). The dividing line between the two, while somewhat ill-defined, is in the vicinity of 50 eV energy loss.

Instrumental developments have opened up the ultra-low energy loss part of the EELS spectrum, enabling vibrational spectroscopy in the TEM. Both IR-active and non-IR-active vibrational modes are present in EELS.

== EEL spectrum ==
The electron energy loss (EEL) spectrum (sometimes spelled EELS spectrum) can be roughly split into two different regions: the low-loss spectrum (up until about 50 eV in energy loss) and the high-loss spectrum. The low-loss spectrum contains the zero-loss peak (signal from all the electrons which did not loose a measurable energy) as well as the phonon and plasmon peaks, and contains information about the band structure and dielectric properties of the sample. It is also possible to resolve the energy spectrum in momentum to directly measure the band structure. The high-loss spectrum contains the ionisation edges that arise due to inner shell ionisations in the sample. These are characteristic to the species present in the sample, and as such can be used to obtain accurate information about the chemistry of a sample.

==Thickness measurements==
EELS allows quick and reliable measurement of local thickness in transmission electron microscopy. The most efficient procedure is the following:
* Measure the energy loss spectrum in the energy range about −5..200 eV (wider better). Such measurement is quick (milliseconds) and thus can be applied to materials normally unstable under electron beams.
* Analyse the spectrum: (i) extract zero-loss peak (ZLP) using standard routines; (ii) calculate integrals under the ZLP (&quot;I0&quot;) and under the whole spectrum (&quot;I&quot;).
* The thickness &quot;t&quot; is calculated as mfp*&quot;ln(I/I0)&quot;. Here mfp is the mean free path of electron inelastic scattering, which has been tabulated for most elemental solids and oxides.

The spatial resolution of this procedure is limited by the plasmon localization and is about 1 nm, meaning that spatial thickness maps can be measured in scanning transmission electron microscopy with ~1 nm resolution.

==Pressure measurements==
The intensity and position of low-energy EELS peaks are affected by pressure. This fact allows mapping local pressure with ~1 nm spatial resolution.
* &quot;Peak shift method&quot; is reliable and straightforward. The peak position is calibrated by independent (usually optical) measurement using a diamond anvil cell. However, the spectral resolution of most EEL spectrometers (0.3-2 eV, typically 1 eV) is often too crude for the small pressure-induced shifts. Therefore, the sensitivity and accuracy of this method is relatively poor. Nevertheless, pressures as small as 0.2 GPa inside helium bubbles in aluminum have been measured.
* &quot;Peak intensity method&quot; relies on pressure-induced change in the intensity of dipole-forbidden transitions. Because this intensity is zero for zero pressure the method is relatively sensitive and accurate. However, it requires existence of allowed and forbidden transitions of similar energies and thus is only applicable to specific systems, e.g., Xe bubbles in aluminum.

==Use in confocal geometry==
Scanning confocal electron energy loss microscopy (SCEELM) is a new analytical microscopy tool that enables a double corrected transmission electron microscope to achieve sub-10 nm depth resolution in depth sectioning imaging of nanomaterials. It was previously termed as energy filtered scanning confocal electron microscopy due to the lack to full spectrum acquisition capability (only a small energy window on the order of 5 eV can be used at a time). SCEELM takes advantages of the newly developed chromatic aberration corrector which allows electrons of more than 100 eV of energy spread to be focused to roughly the same focal plane. It has been demonstrated that a simultaneous acquisition of the zero loss, low-loss, and core loss signals up to 400 eV in the confocal geometry with depth discrimination capability.

<text>Year 312 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Corvus and Mus (or, less frequently, year 442 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 312 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
====Cyrenaica====
* The people of Cyrene in the Cyrenaica rise up in a revolt against Ptolemy, putting the Ptolemaic garrison, which occupies their citadel, under siege. After they execute Ptolemy&#x27;s envoys, who came to bade them to cease their sedition, he sends Agis (one of his generals) with an army and Epaunetus (another general) with a fleet to put down the rebellion. Agis storms the city, captures the rebels, and sends the ringleaders to Alexandria.

====Cyprus====
* After putting down the revolt in Cyrene, Ptolemy sails to Cyprus with a great force. He arrests the rulers of Kition, Lapethus, Kyrenia, and Marion for being too friendly towards Antigonus and/or too hostile towards himself, he then establishes his friend Nicocreon of Salamis as strategos (governor-general) of Cyprus .

==== Syria/Mesopotamia/Babylonia ====
* Ptolemy raids Antigonus&#x27; territories in Cilicia and Syria, and then sails back to Egypt.
* At the end of the year, Ptolemy invades Antigonus&#x27; territories in Palestine with an army of 18,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry. The resulting Battle of Gaza leads to a triumph for Ptolemy over Antigonus&#x27; son, Demetrius.
* Demetrius rallies the remnants of his army at Tripolis and summons reinforcements from the garrisons of upper Syria and Cilicia; he also writes his father, Antigonus, and urges him to send help. Meanwhile Ptolemy captures Acre, Joppa, Samaria and Sidon, and starts to besiege Tyre.
*Seleucus ceases his service to Ptolemy and returns to his former province, Babylonia. This event takes place on October 1 and becomes the starting point of the Seleucid era.

==== Asia Minor ====
* At the start of the year, Asander (Antigonus&#x27; governor of Caria) rebels, forcing Antigonus (wintering with his main army in Phrygia) to invade Caria. Calling all his forces from their winter quarters, he divides them into four columns: the first is sent to take Miletus; the second, under his nephew Ptolemy, campaigns through central Caria from east to west; a third marches to and takes Theangela; Antigonus himself with the main army campaigns from north to south capturing Tralles, Iasus and Kaunos. Caria is taken in the space of weeks.
* Antigonus sends his nephew Telesphoros with an army of 5,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to mainland Greece to carry on the war against Cassander.

==== Greece/Macedon/Thrace ====
* The people of Epirus elevate Aeacides&#x27; brother, Alcetas, to the kingship.
* Alcetas advances on the Macedonian garrison of Acarnania under Lyciscus, a general of Cassander. Three battles are fought and a defeated Alcetas flees to a fortress in Epirus. Cassander marches the main Macedonian field army into Epirus and forces Alcetas to ally with him.
* Cassander marches on Apollonia, which people had driven out his garrison with the help of the Illyrians, but the Appolonians and Illyrians defeat him in battle, driving him out of western Greece for the time being.
* The people of Epirus, tired of Alcetas (who ruled Epirus harshly), rose up and murdered him and his sons.
* Telesphorus arrives in to the Peloponnese and starts expelling Cassander&#x27;s garrisons. He successfully liberates all cities and towns that are being held for Cassander by Polyperchon and his son Alexander; all except Sicyon and Corinth who are being defended by Polyperchon and Alexander themselves.
* Cassander sails against the city of Oreus on Euboea with a fleet of 30 ships. He blockades its port trying to force the city&#x27;s surrender.
* Telesphorus comes to the aid of Oreus from the Peloponnese with 20 ships and 1,000 infantry, while Antigonid admiral Medius sails to relieve Oreus with a 100 ships from Asia Minor; they break Cassander&#x27;s blockade.
* Cassander receives reinforcements from Athens (under Thymochares the Sphettian, descendant of Thymochares) and defeats Telesphoros&#x27; squadron.
* Antigonus sends his nephew Ptolemy, whom he has made Strategos of Greece, with 5,000 infantry, 500 cavalry and 150 warships (he had recalled and reinforced Medius&#x27; fleet) to take command of all Antigonid forces and affairs in Greece.
* Cassander abandons the siege of Oreus, concentrating his forces at Chalcis to counter Ptolemy who has landed at Bathys in Boeotia and has been reinforced by the Boeotian League with 2,200 infantry and 1,300 cavalry.
* Antigonus marches his main field army to the Hellespontine region threatening to invade Europe and attack Macedon, forcing Cassander to retreat to Macedon to prepare its defences.
* Antigonus arrives at the Propontis and tries to negotiate an alliance with Byzantium, but the city, at the urging of Lysimachus, remains neutral; without it Antigonus gives up on the idea of crossing over into Europe.
* The Corcyraeans come to the aid of Apollonia and Epidamus and help the Apollonians and the people of Epidamus to remove the garrisons Cassander put there. They free Apollonia, but give the city of Epidamus to the Illyrian king Glaucias.
* Ptolemy captures Chalcis, removes Cassander&#x27;s garrison, but does not install a garrison of his own. Eretria and Carystus, both on Euboea as well, join Antigonus&#x27; alliance. Ptolemy crosses over to mainland Greece and captures Oropos, again removing Cassander&#x27;s garrison, he then hands it over to Antigonus&#x27; ally, the Boeotian League. After Oropos he invades Attica putting pressure on Athens to negotiate a truce. From Attica he marches on Thebes, captures it and removes Cassander&#x27;s garrison. He moves on to Phocis, drives out Cassander&#x27;s garrisons in that region as well, and moves into Opuntian Locris, where he besieges Opus.
* Telesphorus, who had been subordinated to Antigonus&#x27; other nephew Ptolemy considered this an insult and ends his friendship with Antigonus through betrayal.
* Telesphorus enters Elis, fortifies its citadel, and enslaves the city. He then marches on Olympia and plunders its sacred precinct collecting 500 talents; with his booty Telesphorus stars hiring mercenaries.
* Ptolemy soon restores the situation and persuades Telesphorus to give up his revolt.

==== Sicily ====
* Agathocles, tyrant of Syracuse, increased the size of his forces until they surpassed the Carthaginian garrison forces on the island.
* Carthage, concerned with Agathocles&#x27; increasing powers, decided to send 130 warships and 14,200 soldiers under the command of a general named Hamilcar (son of Gisco, grandson of Hanno the Great).
* Hamilcar&#x27;s fleet was caught by several storms which sank 60 warships and destroyed 200 transports.
* After landing on Sicily, Hamilcar gathered the remnants of his army, he also started to hire mercenaries, enlist those Sicilians opposed to Agathocles and enroll soldiers from the Carthaginian garrisons already on Sicily. In this way he was able to muster a large army.
* Agathocles, fearing Gela would turn against him, took over the city, executed 4,000 leading Geloans he suspected of treason, and confiscated their property.

==== Italy ====
* The Second Samnite War continues: there are rumours of a mobilisation of the Etruscans; since the consul Marcus Valerius Maximus Corvus is campaigning in Samnium and his consular colleague Publius Decius Mus is to ill to lead an army, the people appoint Gaius Sulpicius Longus as dictator. Sulpicius appoints Gaius Junius Bubulcus Brutus as his Magister Equitum (Second-in-command). Sulpicius &#x27; mission is to defend against the Etruscan invasion which never materialize; Sulpicius and Brutus remain in camp at Rome until the end of the campaigning season.
* The Roman censor, Appius Claudius Caecus, a patrician, enters office and begins construction of the Appian Way (the Via Appia) between Rome and Capua. He also embarks on a program of political reform, including the distribution of the landless citizens of Rome among the tribes, which at this time constitute basic political units. Appius also admits sons of freedmen into the Roman Senate. He also asserts the right of freed slaves to hold office.
* Rome gets its first pure drinking water as engineers complete the first aqueduct into the city, the Aqua Appia.

<text>Year 307 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Caecus and Violens (or, less frequently, year 447 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 307 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Babylonia ====
* Antigonus makes peace with Seleucus, who is left free to consolidate his empire in the east.

====Syria====
* Antigonus founds the city of Antigoneia on the Orontes intended to become his eastern capital.

====Asia Minor====
* Antigonus prepares an expedition to Greece under his son Demetrius. They gather a fleet of 250 ships and a large army in western Asia Minor. Antigonus gives his son 5.000 talents and some of his top officers, chief among them Medius of Larissa and Aristodemus of Miletus.

==== Greece ====
* At the beginning of June (the 26th day of the Attic month of Thargelion: Plut. &quot;Dem.&quot; 8,3) Demetrius, son of Antigonus, launches a surprise attack on Pireaus, Athens&#x27; harbour; his forces are able to secure control of the entire port city, except the fortress on the Munychia which remains in the hands of Dionysius, the commander of Cassander&#x27;s garrison in Athens. 
* Demetrius of Phalerum, who ruled Athens for 10 years with the support of Cassander, recognizes his position has become untenable. He opens up negotiations, and after several diplomatic exchanges involving Aristodemus of Miletus, Antigonus top diplomat, he is given safe conduct to Thebes. Eventually he settles in Alexandria 
* Demetrius captures the fortress on the Munychia and razes it to the ground. The old democracy, with the old constitution, is re-established in Athens under the leadership of Stratocles and Demochares. The grateful Athenians honour Antigonus and Demetrius as divine saviours (). 
* Demetrius captures Megara and there he restores the old constitution as well.
* Antigonus gives Athens control of the island of Lemnos and Imbros.
* Upon becoming ruler of Epirus, Pyrrhus allies himself with his brother-in-law, Demetrius and through him with Antigonus.

==== North Africa ====
* Agathocles, the tyrant of Syracuse, (who has been campaigning in North Africa for several years) launches a surprise attack on Utica. He captures around 300 citizens outside the walls and tries to negotiate a surrender of the city; Utica refuses. Agathocles then uses the prisoners as human shields by binding them to his siege engines.
* Agathocles assaults the walls of Utica. The Uticans, despite having to inflict death and injury on their fellow citizens, fiercely defend their city. Eventually, Agathocles&#x27; army is able to break into the city, they sacked the city and left behind a garrison.
* Agathocles besieges and takes a town called Hippu Acra. After capturing Hippu Acra several towns and cities come over to his side; even some Numidian tribes start sending their warriors to join Agathocles.
* With his expeditionary army now superior in numbers to the Carthaginians, Agathocles decides to leave his son Archagathus in command of the African campaign and return to Sicily. He starts constructing transports and when enough ships have been built sets sail for Sicily.
* Archagathus sends Eumachus, one of his father&#x27;s generals, on two successful inland campaigns. On both occasions Eumachus gained a lot of war booty. 
* Carthage musters (30,000 soldiers in total) and sends out three armies; one inland, one into the midlands, and one against the cities along the coast.
* Archagathus counters by dividing his army in three and sending them against the Carthaginian armies. Unfortunately for the Greeks, one army (commanded by Aeschrion) gets ambushed and another (commanded by Eumachus) is defeated in battle. Archagathus retreats to Tunis, regroups his army and sends messengers to his father in Sicily to inform him on the situation .The Carthaginians concentrate their forces at Tunis as well and start a blockade of the city.
* Agathocles returns to his expeditionary army. Trying to restore his army&#x27;s moral, he fights a battle under less than ideal conditions and suffers a bloody defeat (losing 3,000 soldiers).
* During a victory ceremony involving human sacrifice (the Carthaginians sacrificed prisoners of war by burning them alive) the Carthaginian camp catches fire, in the ensuing panic the Carthaginian army breaks and flees back to Carthage.
* 5,000 Libyans deserters, who came fleeing back to Agathocles&#x27; camp, cause panic in the Greek camp, scattering the army.
* After the lost battle and the night-time panic, all his Libyan allies desert. With his army in no condition to fight on, Agathocles decides to return to Sicily.
* Agathocles abandons his army and his sons and secretly sails back to Sicily. His soldiers kill his sons in anger.

==== Sicily ====
* Xenodocus, a general from Acragas, leads an army of 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry against Agathocles&#x27; generals on Sicily. Leptines and Demophilus, two of Agathocles&#x27; generals, oppose Xenoducus with 8,200 infantry and 1,200 cavalry. Xenoducus is defeated and retreats to Acragas. As a result of this defeat the people of Acragas give up the fight against Agathocles.
* Agathocles puts in at Selinus, marches on Heraclea (probably Heraclea Minoa) and forces its people to submit once more. He then marches across the island on the city of Therma, makes a treaty with its people and removes its Carthaginian garrison. After taking Cephaloedium (near Therma), he marches back south taking the cities of Centuripa and Sicily.
* Deinocrates, the leader of the exiles, proclaims himself the champion of common liberty and uses this to gather the bulk of Agathocles&#x27; enemies into one army. After mustering an army of 20,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, he marches on Agathocles, who refuses to do battle and retreats to Syracuse.
* Receiving word of the losses that had been inflicted on his expeditionary army (commanded by his son Archagathus) in Africa, Agathocles equips 17 warships to go to his son&#x27;s aid. While breaking through the Carthaginian blockade, he is able to defeat his opponents&#x27; fleet.
* Leptines, one of Agathocles&#x27; generals, defeats Xenodocus for the second time.
* Agathocles purges Syracuse of his opponents; 500 citizens are executed. With the city secure in his loyalty he sets sail for Africa.
* After meeting disaster in Africa (losing his army and two of his sons), Agathocles returns to Sicily. In dire need of cash, he razes the city of Segesta.

==== China ====
* The Chinese King Wuling of Zhao reforms the military of the State of Zhao by putting more emphasis on cavalry over charioteers.

=== By topic ===

==== Philosophy ====
* Epicureanism, a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of Epicurus, is founded (approximate date).
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
== Deaths ==
* Archagathus, son of Agathocles the tyrant of Syracuse.
* Heracleides, son of Agathocles the tyrant of Syracuse.

<text>Year 303 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Lentulus and Aventinensis (or, less frequently, year 451 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 303 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>Alexander Aleksandrovich Alekhine (March 24, 1946) was a Russian and French chess player and the fourth World Chess Champion, a title he held for two reigns.

By the age of 22, Alekhine was already among the strongest chess players in the world. During the 1920s, he won most of the tournaments in which he played. In 1921, Alekhine left Soviet Russia and emigrated to France, which he represented after 1925. In 1927, he became the fourth World Chess Champion by defeating José Raúl Capablanca.

In the early 1930s, Alekhine dominated tournament play and won two top-class tournaments by large margins. He also played first board for France in five Chess Olympiads, winning individual prizes in each (four medals and a brilliancy prize). Alekhine offered Capablanca a rematch on the same demanding terms that Capablanca had set for him, and negotiations dragged on for years without making much progress. Meanwhile, Alekhine defended his title with ease against Efim Bogoljubov in 1929 and 1934. He was defeated by Max Euwe in 1935, but regained his crown in the 1937 rematch. His tournament record, however, was uneven, and rising young stars like Paul Keres, Reuben Fine, and Mikhail Botvinnik threatened his title. Negotiations for a title match with Keres or Botvinnik were halted by the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939. Negotiations with Botvinnik for a world title match were proceeding in 1946 when Alekhine died in Portugal, in unclear circumstances. Alekhine is the only World Chess Champion to have died while holding the title.

Alekhine is known for his fierce and imaginative attacking style, combined with great positional and endgame skill. He is highly regarded as a chess writer and theoretician, having produced innovations in a wide range of chess openings and having given his name to Alekhine&#x27;s Defence and several other opening variations. He also composed some endgame studies.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Alekhine was born into a wealthy Russian family in Moscow, Russia, on October 31, 1892. His father, Alexander Ivanovich Alekhin, was a landowner and Privy Councilor to the conservative legislative Fourth Duma. His mother, Anisya Ivanovna Alekhina (born Prokhorova), was the daughter of a rich industrialist. Alekhine was introduced to chess by his mother, his older brother Alexei, and his older sister Varvara.

===Early chess career (1902–1914)===

Alekhine&#x27;s first known game was from a correspondence chess tournament that began on December 3, 1902, when he was ten years old. He participated in several correspondence tournaments, sponsored by the chess magazine &quot;Shakhmatnoe Obozrenie&quot; (&quot;Chess Review&quot;), between 1902 and 1911. In 1907, he played his first over-the-board tournament, the Moscow chess club&#x27;s Spring Tournament. Later that year, he tied for 11th–13th in the club&#x27;s Autumn Tournament; his elder brother, Alexei, tied for 4th–6th place. In 1908, Alexander won the club&#x27;s Spring Tournament, at the age of 15. In 1909, he won the All-Russian Amateur Tournament in Saint Petersburg. For the next few years, he played in increasingly stronger tournaments, some of them outside Russia. At first he had mixed results, but by the age of 16 he had established himself as one of Russia&#x27;s top players. He played first board in two friendly team matches: St. Petersburg Chess Club vs. Moscow Chess Club in 1911 and Moscow vs. St. Petersburg in 1912 (both drew with Yevgeny Znosko-Borovsky). By the end of 1911, Alekhine moved to St. Petersburg, where he entered the Imperial Law School for Nobles. By 1912, he was the strongest chess player in the St. Petersburg Chess Society. In March 1912, he won the St. Petersburg Chess Club Winter Tournament. In April 1912, he won the 1st Category Tournament of the St. Petersburg Chess Club. In January 1914, Alekhine won his first major Russian tournament, when he tied for first place with Aron Nimzowitsch in the All-Russian Masters Tournament at St. Petersburg. Afterwards, they drew in a mini-match for first prize (each won a game). Alekhine also played several matches in this period, and his results showed the same pattern: mixed at first but later consistently good.

===Top-level grandmaster (1914–1927)===
In April–May 1914, another major St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament was held in the capital of the Russian Empire, in which Alekhine took third place behind Emanuel Lasker and José Raúl Capablanca. By some accounts, Tsar Nicholas II conferred the title of &quot;Grandmaster of Chess&quot; on each of the five finalists (Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Siegbert Tarrasch, and Frank Marshall). (Chess historian Edward Winter has questioned this, stating that the earliest known sources supporting this story are an article by Robert Lewis Taylor in the June 15, 1940, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and Marshall&#x27;s autobiography &quot;My 50 Years of Chess&quot; (1942).) Alekhine&#x27;s surprising success made him a serious contender for the World Chess Championship. Whether or not the title was formally awarded to him, &quot;Thanks to this performance, Alekhine became a grandmaster in his own right and in the eyes of the audience.&quot; In July 1914, Alekhine tied for first with Marshall in Paris.

====World War I and post-revolutionary Russia====
In July–August 1914, Alekhine was leading an international Mannheim tournament, the 19th DSB Congress (German Chess Federation Congress) in Mannheim, Germany, with nine wins, one draw and one loss, when World War I broke out. Alekhine&#x27;s prize was 1,100 marks (worth about 11,000 euros in terms of purchasing power today). After the declaration of war against Russia, eleven &quot;Russian&quot; players (Alekhine, Efim Bogoljubov, Fedor Bogatyrchuk, Alexander Flamberg, N. Koppelman, Boris Maliutin, Ilya Rabinovich, Peter Romanovsky, Pyotr Saburov, Alexey Selezniev, and Samuil Weinstein) were interned in Rastatt, Germany. On September 14, 17, and 29 of 1914, four of them (Alekhine, Bogatyrchuk, Saburov, and Koppelman) were freed and allowed to return home. Alekhine made his way back to Russia (via Switzerland, Italy, London, Sweden, and Finland) by the end of October 1914. A fifth player, Romanovsky, was released in 1915, and a sixth, Flamberg, was allowed to return to Warsaw in 1916.

When Alekhine returned to Russia, he helped raise money by giving simultaneous exhibitions to aid the Russian chess players who remained interned in Germany. In December 1915, he won the Moscow Chess Club Championship. In April 1916, he won a mini-match against Alexander Evensohn with two wins and one loss at Kiev, and in summer he served in the Union of Cities (Red Cross) on the Austrian front. In September, he played five people in a blindfold display at a Russian military hospital at Tarnopol. In 1918, he won a &quot;triangular tournament&quot; in Moscow. In June of the following year, after the Russians forced the German army to retreat from Ukraine, Alekhine was charged with links with White movement counter-intelligence and was briefly imprisoned in Odessa&#x27;s death cell by the Odessa Cheka. Rumors appeared in the West that he had been killed by the Bolsheviks.

====1920–1927====
When conditions in Russia became more settled, Alekhine proved he was among Russia&#x27;s strongest players. In January 1920, he swept the championship of Moscow (11/11), but was not declared champion because he was not a resident of the city. In October 1920 he won the All-Russian Chess Olympiad in Moscow (+9−0=6); the tournament was retroactively called the first USSR Championship. His brother Alexei took third place in the tournament for amateurs.

In March 1920, Alekhine married Alexandra Batayeva. They divorced the next year. For a short time in 1920–21, he worked as an interpreter for the Communist International (Comintern) and was appointed secretary to the Education Department. In this capacity, he met a Swiss journalist and Comintern delegate, Annelise Rüegg, who was thirteen years older than he was, and they married on March 15, 1921. Shortly after, Alekhine was given permission to leave Russia for a visit to the West with his wife. He never returned. In June 1921, he left his second wife in Paris and went to Berlin.

In 1921–1923, Alekhine played seven mini-matches. In 1921, he won against Nikolay Grigoriev (+2−0=5) in Moscow, drew with Richard Teichmann (+2−2=2) and won against Friedrich Sämisch (+2−0=0), both in Berlin. In 1922, he won against Ossip Bernstein (+1−0=1) and Arnold Aurbach (+1−0=1), both in Paris, and Manuel Golmayo (+1−0=1) in Madrid. In 1923, he won against André Muffang (+2−0=0) in Paris.

From 1921 to 1927, Alekhine won or shared first prize in about two-thirds of the many tournaments in which he played. His &quot;least&quot; successful efforts were a tie for third place at Vienna 1922 behind Akiba Rubinstein and Richard Réti, and third place at the New York 1924 chess tournament, behind ex-champion Emanuel Lasker and world champion José Raúl Capablanca (but ahead of Frank Marshall, Richard Réti, Géza Maróczy, Efim Bogoljubov, Savielly Tartakower, Frederick Yates, Edward Lasker, and Dawid Janowski). Technically, Alekhine&#x27;s play was mostly better than his competitors&#x27;—even Capablanca&#x27;s—but he lacked confidence when playing his major rivals.

Alekhine&#x27;s main goal throughout this period was to arrange a match with Capablanca. He thought the greatest obstacle was not Capablanca&#x27;s play but the requirement under the 1922 &quot;London rules&quot; (at Capablanca&#x27;s insistence) that the challenger raise a purse of US$10,000 (~$162,000 in 2022 terms), of which the defending champion would receive over half even if defeated. Alekhine in November 1921, and Rubinstein and Nimzowitsch in 1923, challenged Capablanca but were unable to raise the $10,000. Raising the money was Alekhine&#x27;s preliminary objective; he even went on tour, playing simultaneous exhibitions for modest fees day after day. In New York on April 27, 1924, he broke the world record for simultaneous blindfold play when he played twenty-six opponents (the previous record was twenty-five, set by Gyula Breyer), winning sixteen games, losing five, and drawing five after twelve hours of play. He broke his own world record on February 1, 1925, by playing twenty-eight games blindfold simultaneously in Paris, winning twenty-two, drawing three, and losing three.

In 1924, he applied for the first time for a residence privilege in France and for French citizenship while pursuing his studies in the Sorbonne Faculty of Law to obtain a PhD. There is no record that he completed his studies there, but he was known as &quot;Dr. Alekhine&quot; in the 1930s.

His French citizenship application was postponed because of his frequent travels abroad to play chess and because he was reported once in April 1922, shortly after his arrival in France, as a &quot;bolshevist charged by the Soviets of a special mission in France&quot;. Later in 1927, the French Chess Federation asked the Ministry of Justice to intervene in Alekhine&#x27;s favor to have him lead the French team in the first Nation tournament to be held in London in July 1927. Nevertheless, Alekhine had to wait for a new law on naturalization which was published on 10 August 1927. The decree granting him French nationality (among hundreds of other appliers) was signed on 5 November 1927 and published in the Official Gazette of the French Republic on 14–15 November 1927, while Alekhine was playing Capablanca for the World title in Buenos Aires.

In October 1926, Alekhine won in Buenos Aires. From December 1926 to January 1927, he beat Max Euwe 5½–4½ in a match. In 1927, he married his third wife, Nadiezda Vasiliev (née Fabritzky), another older woman, the widow of the Russian general V. Vasiliev.

==World Chess Champion, first reign (1927–1935)==

===1927 title match===
In 1927, Alekhine&#x27;s challenge to Capablanca was backed by a group of Argentine businessmen and the president of Argentina, who guaranteed the funds, and organized by the Club Argentino de Ajedrez (Argentine Chess Club) in Buenos Aires. In the World Chess Championship match played from September 16 to November 29, 1927 at Buenos Aires, Alekhine won the title, scoring +6−3=25. This was the longest formal World Championship match until the contest in 1984 between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov. Alekhine&#x27;s victory surprised almost the entire chess world, since he had never previously won a single game from Capablanca. After Capablanca&#x27;s death Alekhine expressed surprise at his own victory, since in 1927 he did not think he was superior to Capablanca, and he suggested that Capablanca had been overconfident. Capablanca entered the match with no technical or physical preparation, while Alekhine got himself into good physical condition and had thoroughly studied Capablanca&#x27;s play. According to Kasparov, Alekhine&#x27;s research uncovered many small inaccuracies, which occurred because Capablanca was unwilling to concentrate intensely. Vladimir Kramnik has commented that this was the first contest in which Capablanca had no easy wins.

===Rematch offered, never finalized===
Immediately after winning the match, Alekhine announced that he was willing to give Capablanca a return match, on the same terms that Capablanca had required as champion: the challenger must provide a stake of US$10,000, of which more than half would go to the defending champion even if he was defeated. Negotiations dragged on for several years, often breaking down when agreement seemed in sight. Their relationship became bitter, and Alekhine demanded much higher appearance fees for tournaments in which Capablanca also played. The rematch never took place. After Capablanca&#x27;s death in 1942, Alekhine wrote that Capablanca&#x27;s demand for a $10,000 stake had been an attempt to avoid challenges.

===Defeats Bogoljubov twice in title matches===

Although he never agreed terms for a rematch against Capablanca, Alekhine played two world title matches with Efim Bogoljubov, in 1929 and 1934, winning handily both times. The first was held at Wiesbaden, Heidelberg, Berlin, The Hague, and Amsterdam from September through November 1929. Alekhine retained his title, scoring +11−5=9. From April to June 1934, Alekhine faced Bogoljubov again in a title match held in twelve German cities, defeating him by five games (+8−3=15). In 1929, Bogoljubov was forty years old and perhaps already past his peak.
===Anti-Bolshevik statements, controversy===
After the world championship match, Alekhine returned to Paris and spoke against Bolshevism. Afterwards, Nikolai Krylenko, president of the Soviet Chess Federation, published an official memorandum stating that Alekhine should be regarded as an enemy of the Soviets. The Soviet Chess Federation broke all contact with Alekhine until the end of the 1930s. His elder brother Alexei, with whom Alexander Alekhine had a very close relationship, publicly repudiated him and his anti-Soviet utterances shortly afterward, but Alexei may have had little choice about this decision.

===Early 1930s===
According to Reuben Fine, Alekhine dominated chess into the mid-1930s. His most famous tournament victories were at the San Remo 1930 chess tournament (+13=2, 3½ points ahead of Nimzowitsch) and the Bled 1931 chess tournament (+15=11, 5½ points ahead of Bogoljubov). He won most of his other tournaments outright, shared first place in two, and the first tournament in which he placed lower than first was Hastings 1933–34 (shared second place, ½ point behind Salo Flohr). In 1933, Alekhine also swept an exhibition match against Rafael Cintron in San Juan (+4−0=0), but only managed to draw another match with Ossip Bernstein in Paris (+1−1=2).

From 1930 to 1935, Alekhine played first board for France at four Chess Olympiads, winning the first brilliancy prize at Hamburg in 1930, gold medals for board one at Prague in 1931 and Folkestone in 1933, and the silver medal for board one at Warsaw in 1935. His loss to Latvian master Hermanis Matisons at Prague in 1931 was his first loss in a serious chess event since winning the world championship.

In the early 1930s, Alekhine travelled the world giving simultaneous exhibitions, including Hawaii, Tokyo, Manila, Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the Dutch East Indies. In July 1933, he played thirty-two people blindfold simultaneously (a new world record) in Chicago, winning nineteen, drawing nine and losing four games.

In 1934 Alekhine married his fourth wife, Grace Freeman (née Wishaar), sixteen years his senior. She was the American-born widow of a British tea-planter in Ceylon, who retained her British citizenship to the end of her life and remained Alekhine&#x27;s wife until his death.

In the early 1930s, around 1933 according to Reuben Fine, it was noticed that Alekhine was drinking increasing amounts of alcohol. Hans Kmoch wrote that Alekhine first drank heavily during the tournament at Bled in 1931, and drank heavily through the 1934 match with Bogoljubov.

==Loss of the World title (1935–1937)==

In 1933, Alekhine challenged Max Euwe to a championship match. Euwe, in the early 1930s, was regarded as one of three credible challengers (the others were José Raúl Capablanca and Salo Flohr). Euwe accepted the challenge for October 1935. Earlier that year, Dutch radio sports journalist Han Hollander asked Capablanca for his views on the forthcoming match. In the rare archival film footage, in which Capablanca and Euwe both speak, Capablanca replies: &quot;Dr. Alekhine&#x27;s game is 20% bluff. Dr. Euwe&#x27;s game is clear and straightforward. Dr. Euwe&#x27;s game—not so strong as Alekhine&#x27;s in some respects—is more evenly balanced.&quot; Then Euwe gives his assessment in Dutch, explaining that his feelings alternated from optimism to pessimism, but in the previous ten years, their score had been evenly matched at 7–7.

On October 3, 1935, the world championship match began in Zandvoort, the Netherlands. Although Alekhine took an early lead, from game thirteen onwards Euwe won twice as many games as Alekhine. The challenger became the new champion on December 16, 1935, with nine wins, thirteen draws, and eight losses. This was the first world championship match in which seconds were officially employed: Alekhine had the services of Salo Landau, and Euwe had Géza Maróczy. Euwe&#x27;s win was a major upset. Kmoch wrote that Alekhine drank no alcohol for the first half of the match, but later took a glass before most games.
However, Salo Flohr, who also assisted Euwe, thought overconfidence caused more problems than alcohol did for Alekhine in this match, and Alekhine himself had previously said he would win easily. Later World Champions Vasily Smyslov, Boris Spassky, Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov analyzed the match for their own benefit and concluded that Euwe deserved to win and that the standard of play was worthy of a world championship.

According to Kmoch, Alekhine abstained from alcohol altogether for five years after the 1935 match. In the eighteen months after losing the title, Alekhine played in ten tournaments, with uneven results: tied for first with Paul Keres at Bad Nauheim in May 1936; first place at Dresden in June 1936; second to Flohr at Poděbrady in July 1936; sixth, behind Capablanca, Mikhail Botvinnik, Reuben Fine, Samuel Reshevsky, and Euwe at Nottingham in August 1936; third, behind Euwe and Fine, at Amsterdam in October 1936; tied for first with Salo Landau at Amsterdam (&quot;Quadrangular&quot;), also in October 1936; in 1936/37 he won at the Hastings New Year tournament, ahead of Fine and Erich Eliskases; first place at Nice (&quot;Quadrangular&quot;) in March 1937; third, behind Keres and Fine, at Margate in April 1937; tied for fourth with Keres, behind Flohr, Reshevsky and Vladimirs Petrovs, at Kemeri in June–July 1937; tied for second with Bogoljubow, behind Euwe, at Bad Nauheim (&quot;Quadrangular&quot;) in July 1937.

==World Chess Champion, second reign (1937–1946)==

===1937–1939===

Max Euwe was quick to arrange a return match with Alekhine, something José Raúl Capablanca had been unable to obtain after Alekhine won the world title in 1927. Alekhine regained the title from Euwe in December 1937 by a large margin (+10−4=11). In this match, held in the Netherlands, Euwe was seconded by Fine, and Alekhine by Erich Eliskases. The match was a real contest initially, but Euwe collapsed near the end, losing four of the last five games. Fine attributed the collapse to nervous tension, possibly aggravated by Euwe&#x27;s attempts to maintain a calm appearance. Alekhine played no more title matches, and thus held the title until his death.

1938 began well for Alekhine, who won the Montevideo 1938 chess tournament at Carrasco (in March) and at Margate (in April), and tied for first with Sir George Alan Thomas at Plymouth (in September). In November, however, he only tied for 4th–6th with Euwe and Samuel Reshevsky, behind Paul Keres, Reuben Fine, and Mikhail Botvinnik, ahead of Capablanca and Flohr, at the AVRO tournament in the Netherlands. This tournament was played in each of several Dutch cities for a few days at a time; it was therefore perhaps not surprising that rising stars took the first three places, as the older players found the travel very tiring, though Fine was dismissive of this explanation because the distances were short.

Immediately after the AVRO tournament, Botvinnik, who had finished in third place, challenged Alekhine to a match for the world championship. They agreed on a prize fund of US$10,000 with two-thirds going to the winner, and that if the match were to take place in Moscow, Alekhine would be invited at least three months in advance so that he could play in a tournament to get ready for the match. Other details had not been agreed when World War II interrupted negotiations, which the two players resumed after the war.

Keres, who had won the AVRO tournament on tiebreak over Fine, also challenged Alekhine to a world championship match. Negotiations were proceeding in 1939 when they were disrupted by World War II. During the war Keres&#x27; home country, Estonia, was invaded first by the USSR, then by Germany, then again by the USSR. At the end of the war, the Soviet government prevented Keres from continuing the negotiations, on the grounds that he had collaborated with the Germans during their occupation of Estonia (by Soviet standards).

Alekhine was representing France at first board in the 8th Chess Olympiad at Buenos Aires 1939 when World War II broke out in Europe. The assembly of all team captains, with leading roles played by Alekhine (France), Savielly Tartakower (Poland), and Albert Becker (Germany), plus the president of the Argentine Chess Federation, Augusto de Muro, decided to go on with the Olympiad.

Alekhine won the individual silver medal (nine wins, no losses, seven draws), behind Capablanca (only results from finals A and B—separately for both sections—counted for best individual scores). Shortly after the Olympiad, Alekhine swept tournaments in Montevideo (7/7) and Caracas (10/10).

At the end of August 1939, both Alekhine and Capablanca wrote to Augusto de Muro regarding a possible world championship rematch. Whereas the former spoke of a rematch as a virtual certainty, even stating that the Cuban was remaining in Buenos Aires until it came about, the latter referred at length to the financial burden in the aftermath of the Olympiad. Supported by Latin-American financial pledges, José R. Capablanca challenged Alexander Alekhine to a world title match in November. Tentative plans—not, however, backed by a deposit of the required purse ($10,000 in gold)—led to a virtual agreement to play at Buenos Aires, Argentina, beginning on April 14, 1940.

===World War II (1939–1945)===
Unlike many participants in the 1939 Chess Olympiad, Alekhine returned to Europe in January 1940. After a short stay in Portugal, he enlisted in the French army as a sanitation officer.

After the fall of France (June 1940), he fled to Marseille. Alekhine tried to go to America by traveling to Lisbon and applying for an American visa. In October 1940, he sought permission to enter Cuba, promising to play a match with Capablanca. This request was denied. 

====Relationship with Nazi Germany====
Chess historians have had a significant interest in Alekhine&#x27;s affiliation with Nazi Germany. Of ongoing speculation among historians specialising in mid-20th century European chess is whether or not Alekhine was the author of numerous antisemitic pieces of propaganda published in relevant partisan materials at the time. While an analysis of writing styles is perceived to provide evidence supporting the theory Alekhine willingly worked as a propagandist in a non-coercive fashion, Alekhine himself denied this in written letters. 

By some accounts, to protect his wife, Grace, and her French assets (a castle at Saint Aubin-le-Cauf, near Dieppe, which the Nazis looted), he agreed to cooperate with the Nazis. Alekhine took part in chess tournaments in Munich, Salzburg, Kraków/Warsaw, and Prague, organised by Ehrhardt Post, the chief executive of the Nazi-controlled &quot;Grossdeutscher Schachbund&quot; (&quot;Greater Germany Chess Federation&quot;)—Keres, Bogoljubov, Gösta Stoltz, and several other strong masters in Nazi-occupied Europe also played in such events. In 1941, he tied for second-third with Erik Lundin in the Munich 1941 chess tournament (&quot;Europaturnier&quot; in September, won by Stoltz), shared first with Paul Felix Schmidt at Kraków/Warsaw (the 2nd General Government chess tournament, in October) and won in Madrid (in December). The following year he won in the Salzburg 1942 chess tournament (June 1942) and in Munich (September 1942; the Nazis named this the &quot;Europameisterschaft&quot;, which means &quot;European Championship&quot;). Later in 1942 he won at Warsaw/Lublin/Kraków (the 3rd GG-ch; October 1942) and tied for first with Klaus Junge in Prague (&quot;Duras Jubileé&quot;; December 1942). In 1943, he drew a mini-match (+2−2) with Bogoljubov in Warsaw (March 1943), he won in Prague (April 1943) and tied for first with Keres in Salzburg (June 1943).

By late 1943, Alekhine was spending all his time in Spain and Portugal, as the German representative to chess events. This also allowed him to get away from the onrushing Soviet invasion into eastern Europe. In 1944, he narrowly won a match against Ramón Rey Ardid in Zaragoza (+1−0=3; April 1944) and won in Gijón (July 1944). The following year, he won at Madrid (March 1945), tied for second place with Antonio Medina at Gijón (July 1945; the event was won by Antonio Rico), won at Sabadell (August 1945), he tied for first with F. López Núñez in Almeria (August 1945), won in Melilla (September 1945) and took second in Caceres, behind Francisco Lupi (Autumn 1945). Alekhine&#x27;s last match was with Lupi at Estoril near Lisbon, Portugal, in January 1946. Alekhine won two games, lost one, and drew one.

Alekhine took an interest in the development of the chess prodigy Arturo Pomar and devoted a section of his last book (&quot;¡Legado!&quot; 1946) to him. They played at Gijon 1944, when Pomar, aged 12, achieved a creditable draw with the champion.

===Final year and death===

After World War II, Alekhine was not invited to chess tournaments outside the Iberian Peninsula, because of his alleged Nazi affiliation. His original invitation to the London 1946 tournament was withdrawn when the other competitors protested.

While planning for a World Championship match against Botvinnik, Alekhine died aged 53 in his hotel room in Estoril, Portugal, on March 24, 1946. The circumstances of his death are still a matter of debate. It is usually attributed to a heart attack, but a letter in &quot;Chess Life&quot; magazine from a witness to the autopsy stated that choking on meat was the actual cause of death. At autopsy, a three-inch-long piece of unchewed meat was discovered blocking his windpipe. Some have speculated that he was murdered by a French &quot;death squad&quot;. A few years later, Alekhine&#x27;s son, Alexander Alekhine Jr., said that &quot;the hand of Moscow reached his father.&quot; Kevin Spraggett, a Canadian Grandmaster who has lived in Portugal since the late 1980s and has thoroughly investigated Alekhine&#x27;s death, favors this possibility. Spraggett makes a case for the manipulation of the crime scene and the autopsy by the Portuguese secret police PIDE. He believes that Alekhine was murdered outside his hotel room, probably by Soviet agents.

Alekhine&#x27;s burial was sponsored by FIDE, and the remains were transferred to the Cimetière du Montparnasse, Paris, France, in 1956.

His gravestone suffered heavy damage by a cyclone on 26 December 1999. The headstone monument was blown over, shattered and fell on the main gravestone. It was later restored.

==Assessment==
===Playing strength and style===
Alekhine&#x27;s peak period was in the early 1930s, when he won almost every tournament he played, sometimes by huge margins. Afterward, his play declined, and he never won a top-class tournament after 1934. After Alekhine regained his world title in 1937, there were several new contenders, all of whom would have been serious challengers.

Alekhine was one of the greatest attacking players and could apparently produce combinations at will. What set him apart from most other attacking players was his ability to see the potential for an attack and prepare for it in positions where others saw nothing. Rudolf Spielmann, a master tactician who produced many brilliancies, said, &quot;I can see the combinations as well as Alekhine, but I cannot get to the same positions.&quot; Dr. Max Euwe said, &quot;Alekhine is a poet who creates a work of art out of something that would hardly inspire another man to send home a picture post-card.&quot; An explanation offered by Réti was, &quot;he beats his opponents by analysing simple and apparently harmless sequences of moves in order to see whether at some time or another at the end of it an original possibility, and therefore one difficult to see, might be hidden.&quot; John Nunn commented that &quot;Alekhine had a special ability to provoke complications
without taking excessive risks&quot;, and Edward Winter called him &quot;the supreme genius of the complicated position&quot;. Some of Alekhine&#x27;s combinations are so complex that even modern champions and contenders disagree in their analyses of them.

Nevertheless, Garry Kasparov said that Alekhine&#x27;s attacking play was based on solid positional foundations, and Harry Golombek went further, saying that &quot;Alekhine was the most versatile of all chess geniuses, being equally at home in every style of play and in all phases of the game.&quot; Reuben Fine, a serious contender for the world championship in the late 1930s, wrote in the 1950s that Alekhine&#x27;s collection of best games was one of the three most beautiful that he knew, and Golombek was equally impressed.

Alekhine&#x27;s games have a higher percentage of wins than those of any other World Champion, and his drawn games are on average among the longest of all champions&#x27;. His desire to win extended beyond formal chess competition. When Fine beat him in some casual games in 1933, Alekhine demanded a match for a small stake. And in table tennis, which Alekhine played enthusiastically but badly, he would often crush the ball when he lost.

Bobby Fischer, in a 1964 article, ranked Alekhine as one of the ten greatest players in history. Fischer, who was famous for the clarity of his play, wrote of Alekhine: Alekhine has never been a hero of mine, and I&#x27;ve never cared for his style of play. There&#x27;s nothing light or breezy about it; it worked for him, but it could scarcely work for anyone else. He played gigantic conceptions, full of outrageous and unprecedented ideas. ... [H]e had great imagination; he could see more deeply into a situation than any other player in chess history. ... It was in the most complicated positions that Alekhine found his grandest concepts.

Alekhine&#x27;s style had a profound influence on Kasparov, who said: &quot;Alexander Alekhine is the first luminary among the others who are still having the greatest influence on me. I like his universality, his approach to the game, his chess ideas. I am sure that the future belongs to Alekhine chess.&quot; In 2012, Levon Aronian said that he considers Alekhine the greatest chess player of all time.

===Influence on the game===
Several openings and opening variations are named after Alekhine. In addition to the well-known Alekhine&#x27;s Defence (1.e4 Nf6) and the Albin-Chatard-Alekhine Attack in the &quot;orthodox&quot; Paulsen variation of the French Defense, there are Alekhine Variations in: the Budapest Gambit, the Vienna Game, the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez, the Winawer Variation of the French Defense; the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defense, the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted, the Slav Defense, the Queen&#x27;s Pawn Game, the Catalan Opening and the Dutch Defense (where three different lines bear his name). Irving Chernev commented, &quot;The openings consist of Alekhine&#x27;s games, with a few variations.&quot;

Alekhine also composed a few endgame studies, one of which is shown in the diagram, a miniature (a study with a maximum of seven pieces).

Alekhine wrote over twenty books on chess, mostly annotated editions of the games in a major match or tournament, plus collections of his best games between 1908 and 1937. Unlike Wilhelm Steinitz, Emanuel Lasker, Capablanca and Euwe, he wrote no books that explained his ideas about the game or showed beginners how to improve their play. His books appeal to expert players rather than beginners: they contain many long analyses of variations in critical positions, and &quot;singularities and exceptions were his forte, not rules and simplifications&quot;.

Although Alekhine was declared an enemy of the Soviet Union after his anti-Bolshevik statement in 1928, he was gradually rehabilitated by the Soviet chess elite following his death in 1946. Alexander Kotov&#x27;s research on Alekhine&#x27;s games and career, culminating in a biography, &quot;Alexander Alekhine&quot;, led to a Soviet series of Alekhine Memorial tournaments. The first of these, at Moscow 1956, was won jointly by Botvinnik and Vasily Smyslov. In their book &quot;The Soviet School of Chess&quot; Kotov and Yudovich devoted a chapter to Alekhine, called him &quot;Russia&#x27;s greatest player&quot; and praised his capacity for seizing the initiative by concrete tactical play in the opening. Botvinnik wrote that the Soviet School of chess learned from Alekhine&#x27;s fighting qualities, capacity for self-criticism and combinative vision. Alekhine had written that success in chess required &quot;Firstly, self-knowledge; secondly, a firm comprehension of my opponent&#x27;s strength and weakness; thirdly, a higher aim – ... artistic and scientific accomplishments which accord our chess equal rank with other arts.&quot;

===Accusations of &quot;improving&quot; games===

Samuel Reshevsky wrote that Alekhine &quot;allegedly made up games against fictitious opponents in which he came out the victor and had these games published in various chess magazines.&quot; In a recent book Andy Soltis lists &quot;Alekhine&#x27;s 15 Improvements&quot;. The most famous example is his game with five queens in Moscow in 1915. In the actual game, Alekhine, playing as Black, beat Grigoriev in the Moscow 1915 tournament; but in one of his books he presented the &quot;Five Queens&quot; variation (starting with a move he rejected as Black in the original game) as an actual game won by the White player in Moscow in 1915. (He did not say in the book who was who in this version, nor that it was in the tournament.)

In the position shown in the diagram, which never arose in real play, Alekhine claimed that White wins by 24.Rh6, as after some complicated play Black is mated or goes into an endgame a queen down. A later computer-assisted analysis concludes that White can force a win, but only by diverging from Alekhine&#x27;s move sequence at move 20, while there are only three queens.

Chess historian Edward Winter investigated a game Alekhine allegedly won in fifteen moves via a queen sacrifice at Sabadell in 1945. Some photos of the game in progress were discovered that showed the players during the game and their chessboard. Based on the position that the chess pieces had taken on the chessboard in this photo, the game could never have taken the course that was stated in the published version. This raised suspicions that the published version was made up. Even if the published version is a fake, however, there is no doubt that Alekhine did defeat his opponent in the actual game, and there is no evidence that Alekhine was the source of the famous fifteen-move win whose authenticity is doubted.

===Accusations of antisemitism===
During World War II, Alekhine played in several tournaments held in Germany or German-occupied territory, as did many strong players in occupied and neutral countries. In March 1941, a series of articles appeared under Alekhine&#x27;s name in the &quot;Pariser Zeitung&quot;, a German-language newspaper published in Paris by the occupying German forces. Among other things, these articles said that Jews had a great talent for exploiting chess but showed no signs of chess artistry; described the hypermodern theories of Nimzowitsch and Réti as &quot;this cheap bluff, this shameless self-publicity&quot;, hyped by &quot;the majority of Anglo-Jewish pseudo-intellectuals&quot;; and described his 1937 match with Euwe as &quot;a triumph against the Jewish conspiracy&quot;.

During interviews with two Spanish newspapers in September 1941, Alekhine criticised Jewish chess strategy. In one of these, he said that Aryan chess was aggressive but &quot;the Semitic concept admitted the idea of pure defence&quot;, thus the &quot;Jewish&quot; style was supposed to focus merely on exploiting the opponents&#x27; mistakes. He also praised rival chessplayer Capablanca for taking the world title from &quot;the Jew Lasker&quot;. He is reported to have expressed similar views in an interview to the Czech media Svět in 1942.

Almost immediately after the liberation of Paris (and before World War II ended), Alekhine publicly stated that &quot;he had to write two chess articles for the &quot;Pariser Zeitung&quot; before the Germans granted him his exit visa ... Articles which Alekhine claims were purely scientific were rewritten by the Germans, published and made to treat chess from a racial viewpoint.&quot; He wrote at least two further disavowals, in an open letter to the organizer of the 1946 London tournament (W. Hatton-Ward) and in his posthumous book &quot;¡Legado!&quot;. These three denials are phrased differently.

Extensive investigations by Ken Whyld have not yielded conclusive evidence of the authenticity of the articles. Chess writer Jacques Le Monnier claimed in a 1986 issue of &quot;Europe Échecs&quot; that in 1958 he saw some of Alekhine&#x27;s notebooks and found, in Alekhine&#x27;s own handwriting, the exact text of the first antisemitic article, which appeared in &quot;Pariser Zeitung&quot; on March 18, 1941. In his 1973 book &quot;75 parties d&#x27;Alekhine&quot; (&quot;75 of Alekhine&#x27;s games&quot;), however, Le Monnier had written &quot;It will never be known whether Alekhine was behind these articles or whether they were manipulated by the editor of the &quot;Pariser Zeitung&quot;.&quot;

British chess historian Edward G. Winter notes that the articles in the &quot;Pariser Zeitung&quot; misspelled the names of several famous chess masters, which could be interpreted as evidence of forgery or as attempts by Alekhine to signal that he was being forced to write things that he did not believe; but these could simply have been typesetting errors, as Alekhine&#x27;s handwriting was not easy to read. The articles contained (probably) incorrect claims that Lionel Kieseritzky (&quot;Kieseritsky&quot; in English, &quot;Kizierycki&quot; in Polish) was a Polish Jew, although Kieseritzky was neither Polish nor Jewish. Winter concludes: &quot;Although, as things stand, it is difficult to construct much of a defence for Alekhine, only the discovery of the articles in his own handwriting will settle the matter beyond all doubt.&quot; Under French copyright law, Alekhine&#x27;s notebooks did not enter the public domain until January 1, 2017.

There is evidence that Alekhine was not antisemitic in his personal or chess relationships with Jews. In June 1919, he was arrested by the Cheka, imprisoned in Odessa and sentenced to death. Yakov Vilner, a Jewish master, saved him by sending a telegram to the chairman of the Ukrainian Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, who knew of Alekhine and ordered his release. Alekhine accepted and apparently used chess analysis from Charles Jaffe in his World Championship match against Capablanca. Jaffe was a Jewish master who lived in New York City, which Alekhine often visited, and upon his return to New York after defeating Capablanca, Alekhine played a short match as a favour to Jaffe, without financial remuneration. Alekhine&#x27;s second for the 1935 match with Max Euwe was the master Salo Landau, a Dutch Jew. The American Jewish grandmaster Arnold Denker wrote that he found Alekhine very friendly in chess settings, taking part in consultation games and productive analysis sessions. Denker also wrote that Alekhine treated the younger and (at that time) virtually unproven Denker to dinner on many occasions in New York during the 1930s, when the economy was very weak because of the Great Depression. Denker added that Alekhine, during the early 1930s, opined that the American Jewish grandmaster Isaac Kashdan might be his next challenger (this did not in fact take place). He gave chess lessons to 14-year-old prodigy Gerardo Budowski, a German Jew, in Paris in spring 1940. Alekhine also married an American woman who may or may not have had Jewish ancestry, Grace Wishaar, as his fourth wife. Grace Alekhine was the women&#x27;s champion of Paris in 1944.

<text>Year 298 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Barbatus and Centumalus (or, less frequently, year 456 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 298 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<doc id="72501" wikidata="Q4769651" url="?curid=72501" title="Annual Customs of Dahomey">
<text>The Annual Customs of Dahomey (&quot;xwetanu&quot; or &quot;huetanu&quot; in Fon) were the main yearly celebration in the Kingdom of Dahomey, held at the capital, Abomey. These ceremonies were largely started under King Agaja around 1730 and involved significant collection and distribution of gifts and tribute, religious ceremonies involving human sacrifice, military parades, and discussions by dignitaries about the future for the kingdom.

==Origins==
Tradition amongst the Fon in Western Africa, and among other ethnic groups, often had ceremonies in family lineages where all members of the family would gather for a feast, provide gifts to the eldest member of the family, and discuss issues pertaining to the family. As part of the religious Vodun practiced in the area, gifts and sacrifices to the spirits and ancestors would also be given. King Houegbadja (&quot;c.&quot; 1645–1685) changed this widespread practice during his reign by making it so that sacrifices or gifts to spirits would have to be done by the king.

King Agaja (1718–1740) further centralized the ceremonies under the king and the royal dynasty. Under Agaja, the Annual customs became the central religious ceremony in the kingdom, wide participation by most of the population was required, all family lineages were expected to provide gifts and tribute (sometimes considered taxes) to the ruler, and aspects of animal and human sacrifice were added to the practice. The traditional family lineage ceremonies were not allowed in the kingdom until after the royal ceremony was completed. After Agaja the ceremony grew larger, longer and more lavish by future kings.

==Practice==

The Annual Customs involved multiple elaborate components and some aspects may have been added in the 19th century. In general, the celebration involved distribution of gifts, human sacrifice, military parades, and political councils. Its main religious aspect was to offer thanks and gain the approval for ancestors of the royal lineage.

Another function of the Annual Customs was to raise money for the royal family and the kingdom as a whole. Based on the traditional customs of gift-giving to eldest members of lineage lines, the population of the kingdom provided gifts or paid tribute to the king. The king would then display the riches as a sign of the accomplishments of his administration. The wealth was provided and displayed not simply to enrich the kingdom but also to gain the approval of the ancestors. After the display, significant amounts of the gifts were redistributed to the population.

Since Dahomey was a significant military power involved in the slave trade, slaves and human sacrifice became crucial aspects of the ceremony. Captives from war and criminals were killed for the deceased kings of Dahomey. During the ceremony, around 500 prisoners would be sacrificed. As many as 4,000 were reported killed in one of these ceremonies in 1727. Most of the victims were sacrificed through decapitation, a tradition widely used by Dahomean kings, and the literal translation for the Fon name for the ceremony &quot;Xwetanu&quot; is &quot;yearly head business&quot;. In later years this ceremony also included the spilling of human blood from the sacrificed. There was also a significant military parade in the ceremonies that further displayed the military might of the kingdom of Dahomey.

The Annual Customs also included a prominent structure for discussion and debate about public policy in the kingdom. In this respect, scholar John C. Yoder has argued that the customs &quot;served a political function similar to that of parliaments in Western countries&quot;, although still far from the open contests in democracies. The Great Council would convene at the annual customs and bring together important leaders from throughout Dahomey to discuss national policy. The Great Council included a large segment of the population and included women. Debate and discussion would be extensive; low ranking-officials could publicly rebuke high-ranking ones. In the end the king would end the debate by declaring consensus.

In addition, when a king died, his successor would have to include a significant ceremony in his honor to finish the funeral rites. Until such sacrifices and ceremonies were performed, it was considered that the new king was not approved by the spirits of the ancestors.

Items associated with the Customs are preserved at the Abomey Historical Museum, in the Royal Palaces of Abomey.

==Schedule==
By day, according to Yoder.

#Procession from Cana
#Private receptions or levées
#Parade through Great Square, more petitions
#Historical songs sung by court singers
#Parade of the king&#x27;s wealth
#Distribution of wealth, including slain captives
#King reviews troops
#Display of king&#x27;s wealth
#&lt;li value=&quot;17&quot;&gt;Great Council starts to meet in the mornings
#&lt;li value=&quot;25&quot;&gt;Great Council meetings end
#Troops swear loyalty
#Mino stage mock battle and slave raid
#Songs praising the kingdom sung by court singers
#Gifts given to officials for services
#Answers given to petitions

Officials largely spent their evenings building coalitions of political support.

<text>Babi Yar () or Babyn Yar () is a ravine in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and a site of massacres carried out by Nazi Germany&#x27;s forces during its campaign against the Soviet Union in World War II. The first and best documented of the massacres took place on 29–30 September 1941, in which some 33,771 Jews were murdered. Other victims of massacres at the site included Soviet prisoners of war, communists and Romani people. It is estimated that a total of between 100,000 and 150,000 people were murdered at Babi Yar during the German occupation.

The decision to murder all the Jews in Kyiv was made by the military governor &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Kurt Eberhard, the Police Commander for Army Group South, SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Friedrich Jeckeln, and the &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; C Commander Otto Rasch. Sonderkommando 4a as the sub-unit of &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; C, along with the aid of the &quot;SD&quot; and Order Police battalions with the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police backed by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, carried out the orders. Sonderkommando 4a and the 45th Battalion of the German Order Police conducted the shootings. Servicemen of the 303rd Battalion of the German Order Police at this time guarded the outer perimeter of the execution site.

The massacre was the largest mass-murder by the Nazi regime during the campaign against the Soviet Union, and it has been called &quot;the largest single massacre in the history of the Holocaust&quot; to that particular date. It is only surpassed overall by the later October 1941 Odessa massacre of more than 50,000 Jews (committed by German and Romanian troops), and by &quot;Aktion Erntefest&quot; of November 1943 in occupied Poland with 42,000–43,000 victims.

(Translation/spelling note: The English-language spelling of key locations in this article has been in flux in recent years; this article uses the traditional English spelling of the specific site [&quot;Babi Yar&quot; versus the local &quot;Babyn Yar&quot;], but now favors the local &quot;Kyiv&quot; for the spelling of the nearby major city [versus the previously-English-favored &quot;Kiev&quot;].)

==Historical background==
The &quot;Babi Yar&quot; (&quot;Babyn Yar&quot;) ravine was first mentioned in historical accounts in 1401, in connection to the sale of it by &quot;baba&quot; (an old woman) who was also the &quot;cantiniere&quot; in the Dominican Monastery. The word &quot;yar&quot; is Turkic in origin and means &quot;gully&quot; or &quot;ravine&quot;. Over several centuries, the site was used for various purposes, including military camps and at least two cemeteries, including an Orthodox Christian cemetery and a Jewish cemetery. The latter was officially closed in 1937.

==Massacres of September 1941==
Axis forces, mainly German, occupied Kyiv on 19 September 1941. Between 20 and 28 September, explosives planted by the Soviet secret police (the NKVD) caused extensive damage in the city, and on 24 September an explosion rocked Rear Headquarters Army Group South. Two days later, on 26 September, Maj. Gen. Kurt Eberhard, the military governor, and SS- Friedrich Jeckeln, the SS and Police Leader, met at Rear Headquarters Army Group South. There, they decided to exterminate the Jews of Kyiv, claiming that it was retaliation for the explosions. Also present were SS- Paul Blobel, commander of 4a of C, and his superior, SS- Dr. Otto Rasch, commander of C. The mass murder was to be carried out by units under the command of Rasch and Blobel, who were ultimately responsible for many atrocities in Soviet Ukraine during the summer and autumn of 1941.

The implementation of the order was entrusted to 4a of C commanded by Blobel, under the general command of Friedrich Jeckeln. This unit consisted of (SD) and (SiPo), the third company of the Special Duties -SS battalion, and a platoon of the 9th Police Battalion. 4a of C and Police Battalion 45, commanded by Major Besser, conducted the massacre, supported by members of a -SS battalion. Contrary to the &quot;myth of the clean&quot;, the Sixth Army under the command of Field Marshal Walter von Reichenau worked together with the SS and SD to plan and execute the mass-murder of the Jews of Kyiv.

On 26 September 1941, the following order was posted:


On 29 and 30 September 1941, the Nazis and their collaborators murdered approximately 33,771 Jewish civilians at Babi Yar. The order to murder the Jews of Kyiv was given to 4a of C, consisting of SD and SiPo men, the third company of the Special Duties -SS battalion, and a platoon of the No. 9 police battalion. These units were reinforced by police battalions Nos. 45 and 303, by units of the Ukrainian auxiliary police, and supported by local collaborators. 4a and the 45th Battalion of the German Order Police conducted the shootings. Servicemen of the 303rd Battalion of the German Order Police at this time guarded the outer perimeter of the execution site.

The commander of the reported two days later:

According to the testimony of a truck driver named Hofer, victims were ordered to undress and were beaten if they resisted:

The crowd was large enough that most of the victims could not have known what was happening until it was too late; by the time they heard the machine gun fire, there was no chance to escape. All were driven down a corridor of soldiers, in groups of ten, and then shot. A truck driver described the scene.

In the evening, the Germans undermined the wall of the ravine and buried the people under the thick layers of earth. According to the &#x27;s Operational Situation Report, 33,771 Jews from Kyiv and its suburbs were systematically shot dead by machine-gun fire at Babi Yar on 29 and 30 September 1941. The money, valuables, underwear, and clothing of the murdered were turned over to the local ethnic Germans and to the Nazi administration of the city. Wounded victims were buried alive in the ravine along with the rest of the bodies.

==Further massacres==
In the months that followed, thousands more were seized and taken to Babi Yar where they were shot. It is estimated that more than 100,000 residents of Kyiv of all ethnic groups, mostly civilians, were murdered by the Nazis there during World War II. The Syrets concentration camp was also built in the area, which was notorious for its cruelty and execution of three Dynamo Kyiv football players who played in the Match of Death.

Mass executions at Babi Yar continued until the Nazis evacuated the city of Kyiv. On 10 January 1942 about 100 captured Soviet sailors were executed there after being forced to disinter and cremate the bodies of previous victims. In addition, Babi Yar became a place of execution of residents of five Gypsy camps. Patients of the Ivan Pavlov Psychiatric Hospital were gassed and then dumped into the ravine. Thousands of other Ukrainians were murdered at Babi Yar. Ukrainian poet and activist Olena Teliha and her husband, and renowned bandurist Mykhailo Teliha, were murdered there on 21 February 1942. Also murdered in 1941 were Ukrainian activist writer Ivan Rohach, his sister, and his staff.

Upon the Soviet liberation of Kyiv in 1943, Soviet officials led Western journalists to the site of the massacres and allowed them to interview survivors. Among the journalists were Bill Lawrence of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Bill Downs of CBS. Downs described in a report to &quot;Newsweek&quot; what he had been told by one of the survivors, Efim Vilkis:

=== Number of people who were murdered ===
Estimates of the total number of people who were murdered at Babi Yar during the Nazi occupation vary. At the Nuremberg trials in 1946, Soviet prosecutor Lev Smirnov claimed that approximately 100,000 corpses were lying in Babi Yar; he made this estimate using documents which were published by the Extraordinary State Commission which the Soviets set up in order to investigate Nazi crimes after the liberation of Kyiv in 1943.

In a recently published letter to the Israeli journalist, writer, and translator Shlomo Even-Shoshan which was dated 17 May 1965, Anatoly Kuznetsov commented on the Babi Yar :

==Survivors==
One of the most often-cited parts of Anatoly Kuznetsov&#x27;s documentary novel &quot;Babi Yar&quot; is the testimony of Dina Pronicheva, an actress of the Kyiv Puppet Theatre, and a survivor. She was one of those ordered to march to the ravine, to be forced to undress and then be shot. Jumping before being shot and falling on other bodies, she played dead in a pile of corpses. She held perfectly still while the Nazis continued to shoot the wounded or gasping victims. Although the SS had covered the mass grave with earth, she eventually climbed through the soil and escaped. Since it was dark, she had to avoid the torches of the Nazis finishing off the remaining victims still alive, wounded, and gasping in the grave. She was one of the very few survivors of the massacre and later related her story to Kuznetsov. At least 29 survivors are known.

In 2006, Yad Vashem and other Jewish organisations started a project to identify and name the Babi Yar victims. However, so far, only 10% have been identified. Yad Vashem has recorded the names of around 3,000 Jews murdered at Babi Yar, as well as those of some 7,000 Jews from Kyiv who were murdered during the Holocaust.

==Concealment of the crimes==
Before the Nazis retreated from Kyiv ahead of the Soviet offensive of 1944, they were ordered by Wilhelm Koppe to conceal their atrocities in the East. Paul Blobel, who had been in control of the mass murders in Babi Yar two years earlier, supervised the &quot;special action&quot; &quot;Sonderaktion 1005&quot; to eliminate its traces. The &quot;Aktion&quot; was carried out earlier in all extermination camps. The bodies were exhumed, burned and the ashes were scattered over farmland in the vicinity. Several hundred prisoners of war from the Syrets concentration camp were forced to exhume the bodies for cremation in funeral pyres built atop layers of stolen Jewish gravestones.

== Trials ==
In the aftermath of the war, several SS commanders who had planned and supervised the massacre were arrested and put on trial. Paul Blobel, the overall commander of the SS unit responsible for the massacre, was sentenced to death by the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials in the Einsatzgruppen Trial. He was hanged on 7 June 1951 at Landsberg Prison. Otto Rasch was also indicted in the Einsatzgruppen Trial but his case was discontinued for health reasons, and he died in prison in 1948. Friedrich Jeckeln was convicted of war crimes by a Soviet military tribunal in the Riga Trial, sentenced to death, and hanged on 3 February 1946. Kurt Eberhard was arrested by US authorities but committed suicide while in custody in 1947.

In January 1946, 15 former members of the German police (including Paul Scheer) were tried in Kyiv over their roles in the massacre and other atrocities. Twelve of them were sentenced to death (Fritz Beckenhof, Karl Burckhardt, Georg Heinisch, Wilhelm Hellerforth, Hans Isenmann, Emil Jogschat, Emil Knoll, Willi Meier, Paul von Scheer, Eckart Hans von Tschammer und Osten, Georg Truckenbrod, and Oskar Walliser). The other three received prison sentences. Those condemned to death were publicly hanged in the town square of Kyiv on 29 January 1946. Erich Koch, who had been &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; of Ukraine at the time, was tried and sentenced to death by a Polish court for his atrocities in occupied Poland. However, he was never tried for his crimes in occupied Ukraine. His death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and he died in prison in 1986.

Two additional perpetrators were given prison sentences at the Nuremberg Trials. In 1967, 11 men were charged for participating in the massacre in a German court in Darmstadt. After a 14 month trial, seven were convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging between four and fifteen years. In 1971, three more former German police officials were put on trial in Regensburg. The vast majority of the perpetrators were never tried for their roles in the massacre.

==Remembrance==


After the war, specifically Jewish and Roma commemoration efforts encountered difficulty because of the Soviet Union&#x27;s emphasis on secular remembrances honoring all nationalities of the Soviet Union, so memorials (including at Babi Yar) would generally refer to &quot;peaceful victims of fascism.&quot; Memorials were not explicitly forbidden, but successive Soviet leaders preferred instead to emphasise the wide-ranging origins of those murdered at the site. This meant that both Jewish and Roma peoples were not specifically memorialised at the Babi Yar site until the Soviet Union collapsed. Indeed, Yevgeny Yevtushenko&#x27;s 1961 poem on Babi Yar begins &quot;Над Бабьим Яром памятников нет/Nad Babim Yarom pamyatnikov nyet&quot; (&quot;Over Babi Yar there are no monuments&quot;); it is also the first line of Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 13.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, several memorials were erected on the site and elsewhere. The events also formed a part of literature. Babi Yar is located in Kyiv at the juncture of today&#x27;s Kurenivka, Lukianivka and Syrets districts, between Kyrylivska, Melnykov, and Olena Teliha streets and St. Cyril&#x27;s Monastery. After the Orange Revolution, President Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine hosted a major commemoration of the 65th anniversary in 2006, attended by Presidents Moshe Katsav of Israel, Filip Vujanović of Montenegro, Stjepan Mesić of Croatia and Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau. Rabbi Lau pointed out that if the world had reacted to the massacre of Babi Yar, perhaps the Holocaust might never have happened. Implying that this impunity emboldened Hitler, Lau speculated:

In 2006, a message was also delivered on behalf of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, by his representative, Resident Coordinator Francis Martin O&#x27;Donnell, who added a Hebrew prayer Shalom, from the Mourners&#x27; Kaddish.

==Mudslide==
In the spring of 1961, Babi Yar was the site of a massive mudslide. An earthen dam in the ravine was used to hold loam pulp which had been pumped from the local brick factories without sufficient drainage over the course of ten years. The dam collapsed after it was hit by a heavy rainstorm, resulting in a mudslide that swept away the low-lying Kurenivka neighborhood and several other areas. The death toll was estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 people.

==2022 Russian bombing==

On 1 March 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine the site was struck by Russian forces while they were trying to destroy the nearby Kyiv TV Tower. The attack resulted in the death of at least five people.

<text>Year 287 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Marcellus and Rutilus (or, less frequently, year 467 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 287 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Roman Republic ====
* A new law, Lex Hortensia, gives much greater power to the &quot;Concilium Plebis&quot; (Plebeian Council) compared to the Senate. This law is passed following a threat from plebeian soldiers to secede. In the face of this threat, the Senate yields to plebeian concerns over their lack of political power and over their level of debt to the aristocracy. The law is named after Quintus Hortensius, a plebeian, who is made dictator to settle the controversy.
* With the Lex Hortensia in place, in theory the political distinctions in Rome between the patricians and the plebeians disappear. However, in practice, the coalition of leading plebeian families keep control which means that the patricians are able to largely nullify the power of the assemblies. So Roman government continues to be oligarchic in character.

==== Greece ====
* The Macedonians resent the extravagance and arrogance of Demetrius Poliorcetes and are not prepared to fight a difficult campaign for him. When Pyrrhus of Epirus takes the Macedonian city of Verroia, Demetrius&#x27; army promptly deserts and goes over to Pyrrhus&#x27; side as he is much admired by the Macedonians for his bravery. At this change of fortune, Phila, the mother of Antigonus, kills herself with poison.
* Demetrius besieges Athens without success. He leave Antigonus in charge of the war in Greece, assembles all his ships and embarks with his troops to attack Caria and Lydia, provinces in Asia Minor controlled by Lysimachus.
* Agathocles is sent by his father Lysimachus against Demetrius. Agathocles defeats Demetrius and drives him out of his father&#x27;s provinces.
* Pyrrhus is proclaimed King of Macedonia.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

* Archimedes of Syracuse, Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer and philosopher (approximate date) (d. c. 212 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Phila, daughter of Antipater, the regent of Macedonia
* Theophrastus, Greek Peripatetic philosopher and pupil of Aristotle (b. c. 372 BC)

<text>Lyudmila Andreyevna Kondratyeva (; born 11 April 1958) is a Russian former track and field athlete, who competed for the Soviet Union and is the 1980 Olympic 100 m champion.

Kondratyeva began athletics at age 11 at the Children and Youth Sport School in Shakhty, her first trainer being Lyudmila Mikhailovna Pavlenko. Two years later she passed exams into Rostov on Don Children and Youth Sport School, created in 1971, where she was coached by Nina Vasilyevna Lazarchenko. In 1973 she became a member of the Soviet Union National Youth Team, and in 1974 - of the Soviet Union National Team. At the 1975 European Youth Championships Kondratyeva finished 4th in the 200m and in the 4 × 100 m relay. Four years later she became the winner of the 200 m at the 1978 European Championships, where she also won a gold in the 4 × 100 m relay event.

Now one of the medal favourites for the 1980 Summer Olympics, which were held in Moscow, she also ran a non-recognised World Record just before the Olympics. The final in Moscow was a close race, with the first 5 athletes finishing within 1 tenth of a second. A photo finish showed that Kondratyeva had beaten Marlies Göhr of East Germany by just 0.01 seconds. Kondratyeva pulled her hamstring at the finish, thereby not allowing her to run the 200 m or the 4 × 100 m relay.

Unable to compete at the 1984 Summer Olympics due to the boycott led by the Soviet Union, Kondratyeva could not defend her Olympic title. She retired after that season and married Yuriy Sedykh, two-time Olympic champion in the hammer throw, although they would later divorce. The pair had a daughter, Oksana Kondratyeva, who followed in her father&#x27;s footsteps and became an international hammer thrower.

She came out of retirement to compete at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. She made the semi-finals of the 100m and won a bronze medal as part of the Soviet women&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay.

<text>Year 276 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Gurges and Clepsina (or, less frequently, year 478 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 276 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Egypt ====
* The Egyptian King Ptolemy II&#x27;s first wife, Arsinoe I (daughter of the late King Lysimachus of Thrace) is accused, probably at instigation of Ptolemy II&#x27;s sister (who also has the name Arsinoe), of plotting his murder and is exiled by the King. Arsinoe then marries her own brother, a customary practice in Egypt, but scandalous to the Greeks. The suffix &quot;Philadelphoi&quot; (&quot;Brother-Loving&quot;) consequently is added to the names of King Ptolemy II and Queen Arsinoe II. The former queen, Arsinoe I, is banished to Coptos, a city of Upper Egypt near the Wadi Hammamat, while her rival adopts her children.
* The first of the Syrian Wars starts between Egypt&#x27;s Ptolemy II and Seleucid emperor Antiochus I Soter. The Egyptians invade northern Syria, but Antiochus defeats and repels his opponent&#x27;s army.

==== Greece ====
* Antigonus II Gonatas consolidated his control over Macedon and Thessaly. 

==== Sicily ====
* Pyrrhus negotiates with the Carthaginians to end the fighting between them in Sicily. The Carthaginians are inclined to come to terms with Pyrrhus, but he demands that Carthage abandon all of Sicily and make the Libyan Sea the boundary between Carthage and the Greeks. Meanwhile, he begins to display despotic behaviour towards the Sicilian Greeks and soon Sicilian opinion moves against him. Therefore, fearing that his successes in Sicily may lead him to become the despot of their country, the Syracusans ask Pyrrhus to leave Sicily. He does so, and returns to the Italian mainland, noting that he expects Sicily to be a &quot;fair wrestling ring&quot; for Carthage and Rome.

====China====
* General Bai Qi of the State of Qin attacks the State of Wei and captures two cities.
* General Lian Po of the State of Zhou captures the Wei city of Qi.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Eratosthenes, Greek mathematician, geographer and astronomer (d. 194 BC)

<text>Year 275 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Dentatus and Caudinus (or, less frequently, year 479 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 275 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>Year 272 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* The Seleucid king Antiochus I Soter is defeated by Egypt&#x27;s Ptolemy II during the First Syrian War. Ptolemy II annexes Miletus, Phoenicia and western Cilicia from Antiochus. As a result, Ptolemy II extends Egyptian rule as far as Caria and into most of Cilicia.

==== Egypt ====
* Egypt&#x27;s victories solidify the kingdom&#x27;s position as the undisputed naval power of the eastern Mediterranean; the Ptolemaic sphere of power now extends over the Cyclades to Samothrace, and the harbours and coastal towns of Cilicia Trachea, Pamphylia, Lycia and Caria.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Tarentum, a Greek city in Italy, makes peace with the Romans.
* Rome builds the aqueduct &quot;Anio Vetus&quot; on the Esquiline hill.
* Pyrrhus&#x27; departure from southern Italy three years earlier leads to the Samnites finally being conquered by the Romans. With the surrender of Tarentum, the cities of Magna Graecia in southern Italy come under Roman influence and become Roman allies. Rome now effectively dominates all of the Italian peninsula.

==== Greece ====
* Cleonymus, a Spartan of royal blood who has been outcast by his fellow Spartans, asks the King of Macedonia and Epirus, Pyrrhus, to attack Sparta and place him in power. Pyrrhus agrees to the plan, but intends to win control of the Peloponnese for himself. As a large part of the Spartan army led by king Areus I is in Crete at the time, Pyrrhus has great hopes of taking the city easily, but the citizens organise stout resistance, allowing one of Antigonus II&#x27;s commanders, Aminias the Phocian, to reach the city with a force of mercenaries from Corinth. Soon after this, the Spartan king, Areus, returns from Crete with 2,000 men. These reinforcements stiffen Spartan resistance and Pyrrhus, finding that he is losing men to desertion every day, breaks off the attack and starts to plunder the country.
* As they plunder the countryside, Pyrrhus and his troops move onto Argos. Entering the city with his army by stealth, Pyrrhus finds himself caught in a confused battle with the Argives (who are supported by Antigonus&#x27; forces and a detachment from Sparta) in the narrow city streets. During the confusion an old woman watching from a rooftop throws a roof tile at Pyrrhus which stuns him, allowing an Argive soldier to kill him.
* Following his death in Argos, Pyrrhus is succeeded as king of Epirus by his son Alexander II while Antigonus II Gonatas regains his Macedonian throne which he has lost to Pyrrhus two years earlier.

==== India ====
* The Mauryan emperor, Bindusara, sends the Mauryan army to conquer the southern kingdoms. Kadamba is conquered.

==Births==

== Deaths ==
* Aristotimus, Greek tyrant of Elis (approximate date)
* Bindusara, emperor of the Mauryan Empire (b. c. 320 BC)
* Ptolemy, son of Pyrrhus of Epirus (b. 295 BC)
* Pyrrhus of Epirus, king of the Molossians (from c. 297 BC), Epirus (306–301 and 297–272 BC) and Macedon (288–284 and 273–272 BC); involved in disputes in southern Italy against Rome and in Sicily (b. 318 BC)

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* With the encouragement of Alcibiades, the Athenians take the island of Melos (which has remained neutral during the Peloponnesian War). Its inhabitants are treated with great cruelty by the Athenians, with all the men capable of bearing arms being killed, while the women and children are made slaves.
* In Sicily, the Ionian city of Segesta asks for Athenian help from the Dorian city of Selinus (which is supported by the powerful Sicilian city of Syracuse). The people of Syracuse are ethnically Dorian (as are the Spartans), while the Athenians, and their allies in Sicily, are Ionian. The Athenians feel obliged to assist their ally and therefore prepare an armada to attack Sicily.

==== Drama ====
* The tragedian Agathon wins first prize at the Lenaia.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
* Agathon along with Alcibiades and Socrates and Aristophanes and others attend a symposium described by Plato.

* Following the loss by Athens and its allies in the Battle of Mantinea, a political &quot;tug of war&quot; takes place in Athens. Alcibiades joins forces with Nicias against Hyperbolus, the successor of the demagogue politician Cleon as champion of the common people. Hyperbolus tries to bring about the ostracism of either Nicias or Alcibiades, but the two men combine their influence and induce the Athenian people to expel Hyperbolus instead.
* The second battle of Hysiae is fought between the armies of Sparta and Argos during the Peloponnesian War. The Spartan King Agis II was seeking to restore the pro-Spartan faction evicted from Argos by Alcibiades. While he failed to take the city of Argos, he did capture and subsequently destroy the town of Hysiae, killing all its male inhabitants.

<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; (&#x27;Chosen Land&#x27;), originally titled in Spanish as &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&#x27;Philippine National March&#x27;), and also commonly and informally known by its incipit &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Beloved Country&#x27;), is the national anthem of the Philippines. Its music was composed in 1898 by Julián Felipe, and the lyrics were adopted from the Spanish poem &quot;Filipinas&quot;, written by José Palma in 1899.

The composition known as &quot;Lupang Hinirang&quot; was commissioned on June 5, 1898, by Emilio Aguinaldo, head of the Dictatorial Government of the Philippines, as a ceremonial and instrumental national march without lyrics, similar to the status of the &quot;Marcha Real&quot; in Spain. It was first performed in public during the proclamation of Philippine independence at Aguinaldo&#x27;s residence in Kawit, Cavite, on June 12, 1898. It was re-adopted as the national march of the Philippine Republic () in 1899.

Following the defeat of the First Republic in the Philippine–American War and the subsequent Colonial rule of the United States, the Flag Act of 1907 prohibited the public display of flags, banners, emblems, or devices used by the Philippine Republican Army during the war. Under the Flag Act, public performance of the national march was prohibited. Upon repeal of the Flag Act in 1919, the national march regained its popular status as the national anthem of the Philippines. Following the establishment of self-rule under the Commonwealth of the Philippines, , approved on September 5, 1938, officially adopted the musical arrangement and composition by Julián Felipe as the national anthem.

In the years after the revolution, the poem &quot;Filipinas&quot;, written in 1899 by nationalist José Palma, gained widespread popularity as unofficial Spanish lyrics of the anthem. The Spanish lyrics were translated into English and, beginning in the 1940s, in the national language. The current Filipino lyrics, written in 1956 and with a slight revision in the 1960s, were adopted and made official. On February 12, 1998, Republic Act No. 8491 was passed, codifying these lyrics into law.

==History==
&quot;Lupang Hinirang&quot; began as incidental music which President Emilio Aguinaldo commissioned for use in the proclamation of Philippine independence from Spain. This task was given to Julián Felipe and was to replace a march which Aguinaldo had deemed unsatisfactory. The original title of this new march was &quot;Marcha Filipina-Magdalo&quot; (Philippine-Magdalo March), and was later changed to &quot;Marcha Nacional Filipina&quot; (Philippine National March) upon its adoption as the national anthem of the First Philippine Republic on June 11, 1898, a day before independence was to be proclaimed.
Felipe said that he had based his composition on three other musical pieces: the &quot;Marcha Real&quot;, which is the current Spanish national anthem; the &quot;Grand March&quot; from Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;; and the French national anthem, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;. It was played by the &quot;Banda San Francisco de Malabón&quot; (now called the &quot;Banda Matanda&quot;, from present-day General Trias) during the proclamation rites on June 12.

In August 1899, soldier and writer José Palma penned the Spanish poem &quot;Filipinas&quot;, which in turn was derived from a Kapampangan poem called &quot;Labuad Mapalad&quot; by Mariano Proceso Pabalan of Bacolor, Pampanga written in September 1898 during his stay in Casa Hacienda in Bautista, Pangasinan. The poem was published for the first time for the first anniversary of the newspaper &quot;La Independencia&quot; on September 3, 1899, and was subsequently set to the tune of the &quot;Marcha Nacional Filipina&quot;.

The Flag Act of 1907 prohibited the use of the anthem and other Philippine revolutionary and Katipunan symbols for a short period of time. When it was repealed back in 1919, the Insular Government decided to translate the hymn from its original Spanish version to the English version. The first translation was written around that time by the renowned poet Paz Márquez Benítez of the University of the Philippines. The most popular translation, called the &quot;Philippine Hymn&quot;, was written by Senator Camilo Osías and an American, Mary A. Lane. The anthem was played alongside the United States anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, which was adopted in 1931, until the country&#x27;s eventual independence in 1946.

Tagalog translations began appearing in the 1940s, with the first known one titled &quot;Diwa ng Bayan&quot; (Spirit of the Country), which was sung during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. The second most popular one was &quot;O Sintang Lupa&quot; (O Beloved Land) by Julián Cruz Balmaceda, Ildefonso Santos, and Francisco Caballo; this was adopted as the official version in 1948. Upon the adoption of &quot;Diwa ng Bayan&quot;, the song &quot;Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas&quot; and the Japanese national anthem &quot;Kimigayo&quot; were replaced.

During the term of President Ramon Magsaysay, Education Secretary Gregorio Hernández formed a commission to revise the lyrics. On May 26, 1956, the Tagalog translation &quot;Lupang Hinirang&quot; was sung for the first time. Minor revisions were made in the 1960s, and it is this version by Felipe Padilla de León which is presently used.

The Martial Law years from 1972 to 1981 during the second term of Ferdinand Marcos up to the 1986 EDSA Revolution saw the use of the National Anthem as the opening protest song of some political parties, activist organizations, and union groups, accompanied by the use of the &quot;raised clenched fist&quot; salute instead of the traditional hand-to-heart salute. This was notably done by opposition political parties and activists.

Some of the original meanings in &quot;Filipinas&quot; have been lost in translation; for example, &quot;hija del sol de oriente&quot; () in the original Spanish version became &quot;child of the sun returning&quot; in the Philippine Hymn and &quot;perlas ng silanganan&quot; () in the present (official) version. The time signature in performance had been changed from 2/4 to 4/4 to facilitate singing and the key changed from the original C major to G in the 1920s. However, this change was not codified into law.

The 1956 Filipino lyrics were confirmed in 1958 by Republic Act No. 8491 (the &quot;Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines&quot;) in 1998, abandoning use of both the Spanish and English versions. Philippine law requires that the anthem always be rendered in accordance with Felipe&#x27;s original musical arrangement and composition, but the original holograph cannot be located. In 2011, Senator Bong Revilla introduced a bill which, among other things, would have removed the requirement that the anthem be sung &quot;in its original Filipino lyrics and march tempo&quot;, but this was not promulgated into law.

===Other anthems===
&quot;Lupang Hinirang&quot; was not the first Philippine national anthem to ever be conceived. The composer and revolutionist Julio Nakpil composed &quot;Marangal na Dalit ng Katagalugan&quot; (Honorable Hymn of the Tagalog Nation/People) upon the request of Andrés Bonifacio, the leader of the Katipunan, the secret society that had spearheaded the Revolution. Bonifacio had converted the organization into a revolutionary government—with himself as President—known as the Tagalog Republic just before hostilities erupted. The term &quot;Katagalugan&quot; in Bonifacio&#x27;s usage referred to the Philippine Islands and its population as a whole; not just ethnic Tagalogs, but all Filipinos. Nakpil composed his national anthem for Bonifacio in Balara (part of modern Quezon City) in November 1896, and Bonifacio later promoted its use in Cavite, where it was still known as late as 1898. But after Bonifacio&#x27;s &quot;Katipunan&quot; and &quot;Republika ng Katagalugan&quot; were superseded by a succession of various governments led by Aguinaldo starting in 1897, Nakpil&#x27;s anthem was never officially adopted by them.

Some sources assert that an English version written by Mary A. Lane and Camilo Osías was legalized by Commonwealth Act No. 382. The act, however, only concerns itself with the instrumental composition by Julián Felipe.

During World War II, Felipe Padilla de León composed &quot;Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas&quot;, commissioned as a replacement anthem by the Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic. It was later adapted during the martial law era under President Ferdinand Marcos into the patriotic song titled &quot;Hymn of the New Society&quot;, not to be confused with the &quot;March of the New Society&quot;.

==Lyrics==
===Official lyrics===
The following Spanish, English and Tagalog versions of the national anthem have been given official status throughout Philippine history. However, only the current Filipino version is officially recognized by the Flag and Heraldic Code, approved on February 12, 1998, which specifies, &quot;The National Anthem shall always be sung in the &#x27;national language&#x27; within or outside the country; violation of the law is punishable by a fine and imprisonment.&quot; Several bills have been introduced to amend the Flag and Heraldic Code to highlight the importance of complying, abiding and conforming to the standard expression as prescribed by law, but none have been enacted into law.


===Other historical lyrics===


===Proposed lyrical revisions===
In 2018, Senate president Vicente Sotto III criticized the final line, &quot;ang mamatay nang dahil sa &#x27;yo&quot; (literally &quot;to die because of you [the country]&quot; and translated above as &quot;For us, thy sons to suffer and die.&quot;), in reference to Horace&#x27;s &quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori&quot; as &quot;defeatist&quot;, but a proposed recvision with a message of commitment to defending the country&#x27;s independence drew popular backlash. In 2013, musician Joey Ayala, tampered with the national anthem in a forum by changing the last line to &quot;ang magmahal nang dahil sa &#x27;yo&quot; (&quot;to love for the country&quot;) and arranged the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8, drawing mixed reactions from the public. In 2018, Senate President Tito Sotto suggested that last line should be revised to &quot;ang ipaglaban ang kalayaan mo&quot; (&quot;to defend your freedom&quot;) as it reflects the commitment of the Filipinos to defend the country&#x27;s independence, but his suggestion was not well-received online.

== Music and tempo ==
R.A. 8491 specifies that in official or civic gatherings the anthem &quot;shall be in accordance with the musical arrangement and composition of Julián Felipe.&quot; However, when literally followed, this would require performance by a pianist or by a brass band, as these were the only versions that were produced by Julián Felipe. The original version was composed in duple time (i.e., in a time signature of ) and was changed to the present quadruple time () in the 1920s to make singing easier by reducing emphasis on syncopation.

During televised boxing matches featuring Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao, singers have been both praised and criticized by the National Historical Institute (NHI) for singing too slow or too fast. The NHI says that the proper time signature is and the proper tempo is 100 bpm. The NHI also states that the anthem should last 53 seconds.

==Usage==

The anthem is usually played during public gatherings in the Philippines or in foreign countries where the Filipino audience is sizable. The Code also provides that it be played at other occasions as may be allowed by the National Historical Institute (now known as the National Historical Commission of the Philippines). It prohibits its playing or singing for mere recreation, amusement, or entertainment except during International competitions where the Philippines is the host or has a representative; local competitions; during the &quot;sign-on&quot; and &quot;sign-off&quot; of radio broadcasting and television stations in the country; and before the initial and last screening of films and before the opening of theatre performances.

Until 1999, the national anthem was played with four ruffles and flourishes as the presidential salute honors music during the beginning of civil or military parades following Spanish and Taiwanese tradition, especially on national holidays. Since that year it has been played solely during the presentation of award recipients on anniversary parades or following the presidential honors.

== Regulation ==
Article XVI, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution specifies that &quot;The Congress may, by law, adopt a new name for the country, a national anthem, or a national seal, which shall be truly reflective and symbolic of the ideals, history, and traditions of the people. Such law shall take effect only upon its ratification by the people in a national referendum.&quot;

===Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines===
Republic Act No. 8491 (&quot;The Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines&quot;) regulates usage of the National Anthem, and contains the complete lyrics of &quot;Lupang Hinirang&quot;. Enacted in 1998, it requires that the anthem &quot;shall always be sung in the national language&quot; regardless if performed inside or outside the Philippines, and specifies that the singing must be done &quot;with fervor&quot;.

The code specifies penalties for violation of its provisions. Section 48 provides for public censure and cancellation of licenses and permits, Section 49 requires the Department of Education and the Commission on Higher Education to ensure that all students commit the national anthem to memory, section 50 specifies penalties of fine or imprisonment for violations.

<text>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a unit of the United States Department of Labor. It is the principal fact-finding agency for the U.S. government in the broad field of labor economics and statistics and serves as a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System. The BLS collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates essential statistical data to the American public, the U.S. Congress, other Federal agencies, State and local governments, business, and labor representatives. The BLS also serves as a statistical resource to the United States Department of Labor, and conducts research measuring the income levels families need to maintain a satisfactory quality of life.

BLS data must satisfy a number of criteria, including relevance to current social and economic issues, timeliness in reflecting today&#x27;s rapidly changing economic conditions, accuracy and consistently high statistical quality, impartiality in both subject matter and presentation, and accessibility to all. To avoid the appearance of partiality, the dates of major data releases are scheduled more than a year in advance, in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget.

==History==

The Bureau of Labor was established within the Department of the Interior on June 27, 1884, to collect information about employment and labor. Its creation under the Bureau of Labor Act (23 Stat. 60) stemmed from the findings of U.S. Senator Henry W. Blair&#x27;s &quot;Labor and Capital Hearings&quot;, which examined labor issues and working conditions in the U.S. Statistician Carroll D. Wright became the first U.S. Commissioner of Labor in 1885, a position he held until 1905. The Bureau&#x27;s placement within the federal government structure changed three times in the first 29 years following its formation. It was made an independent (sub-Cabinet) department by the Department of Labor Act (25 Stat. 182) on June 13, 1888. The Bureau was then incorporated into the Department of Commerce and Labor by the Department of Commerce Act (32 Stat. 827) on February 14, 1903. Finally, it was transferred under the Department of Labor in 1913, where it resides today. The BLS is now headquartered in the Postal Square Building near the United States Capitol and Washington Union Station.

Since 1915, the BLS has published the &quot;Monthly Labor Review&quot;, a journal focused on the data and methodologies of labor statistics.

The BLS is headed by a commissioner who serves a four-year term from the date he or she takes office. The most recent Commissioner of Labor Statistics is William W. Beach, who was assumed office on March 28, 2019 Beach was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 13, 2019.

Erica Groshen was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on January 2, 2013, and sworn in as the 14th Commissioner of Labor Statistics on January 29, 2013, for a term that ended on January 27, 2017. William Wiatrowski, Deputy Commissioner of the BLS, served as Acting Commissioner until the next commissioner, William Beach was sworn in. Beach served until January 2024, at which time he was succeeded by Erika McEntarfer.

<text>An economic indicator is a statistic about an economic activity. Economic indicators allow analysis of economic performance and predictions of future performance. One application of economic indicators is the study of business cycles. Economic indicators include various indices, earnings reports, and economic summaries: for example, the unemployment rate, quits rate (quit rate in American English), housing starts, consumer price index (a measure for inflation), inverted yield curve, consumer leverage ratio, industrial production, bankruptcies, gross domestic product, broadband internet penetration, retail sales, price index, and changes in credit conditions.

The leading business cycle dating committee in the United States of America is the private National Bureau of Economic Research. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is the principal fact-finding agency for the U.S. government in the field of labor economics and statistics. Other producers of economic indicators includes the United States Census Bureau and United States Bureau of Economic Analysis.

==Classification by timing==
Economic indicators can be classified into three categories according to their usual timing in relation to the business cycle: leading indicators, lagging indicators, and coincident indicators.

===Leading indicators===
Leading indicators are indicators that usually, but not always, change before the economy as a whole changes. They are therefore useful as short-term predictors of the economy. Leading indicators include the index of consumer expectations, building permits, and credit conditions. The Conference Board publishes a composite Leading Economic Index consisting of ten indicators designed to predict activity in the U. S. economy six to nine months in future.

Components of the Conference Board&#x27;s Leading Economic Indicators Index:

#Average weekly hours (manufacturing) — Adjustments to the working hours of existing employees are usually made in advance of new hires or layoffs, which is why the measure of average weekly hours is a leading indicator for changes in unemployment.
#Average weekly initial jobless claims for unemployment insurance — The CB reverses the value of this component from positive to negative because a positive reading indicates a loss in jobs. The initial jobless-claims data is more sensitive to business conditions than other measures of unemployment, and as such leads the monthly unemployment data released by the U.S. Department of Labor. 
#Manufacturers&#x27; new orders for consumer goods/materials — This component is considered a leading indicator because increases in new orders for consumer goods and materials usually mean positive changes in actual production. The new orders decrease inventory and contribute to unfilled orders, a precursor to future revenue. 
#Vendor performance (slower deliveries diffusion index) — This component measures the time it takes to deliver orders to industrial companies. Vendor performance leads the business cycle because an increase in delivery time can indicate rising demand for manufacturing supplies. Vendor performance is measured by a monthly survey from the National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM). This diffusion index measures one-half of the respondents reporting no change and all respondents reporting slower deliveries. 
#Manufacturers&#x27; new orders for non-defense capital goods — As stated above, new orders lead the business cycle because increases in orders usually mean positive changes in actual production and perhaps rising demand. This measure is the producer&#x27;s counterpart of new orders for consumer goods/materials component (#3). 
#Building permits for new private housing units. 
#Stock prices of 500 common stocks — Equity market returns are considered a leading indicator because changes in stock prices reflect investors&#x27; expectations for the future of the economy and interest rates. 
#Leading Credit Index - a composite index developed by the Conference Board consisting of six financial indicators such as yield spreads, loan survey information and investor sentiment
#Interest rate spread (10-year Treasury vs. Federal Funds target) — The interest rate spread is often referred to as the yield curve and implies the expected direction of short-, medium- and long-term interest rates. Changes in the yield curve have been the most accurate predictors of downturns in the economic cycle. This is particularly true when the curve becomes inverted, that is, when the longer-term returns are expected to be less than the short rates. 
#Index of consumer expectations — This is the only component of the leading indicators that is based solely on expectations. This component leads the business cycle because consumer expectations can indicate future consumer spending or tightening. The data for this component comes from the University of Michigan&#x27;s Survey Research Center, and is released once a month.

Economist D.W. Mackenzie suggests that the ratio of private to public employment may also be useful as a leading economic indicator.

=== Lagging indicators ===
Lagging indicators are indicators that usually change after the economy as a whole does. Typically the lag is a few quarters of a year. The unemployment rate is a lagging indicator: employment tends to increase two or three quarters after an upturn in the general economy.. In a performance measuring system, profit earned by a business is a lagging indicator as it reflects a historical performance; similarly, improved customer satisfaction is the result of initiatives taken in the past.

The Index of Lagging Indicators is published monthly by The Conference Board, a non-governmental organization, which determines the value of the index from seven components.

The Index tends to &quot;follow&quot; changes in the overall economy.

The components on the Conference Board&#x27;s index are:

* The average duration of unemployment (inverted)
* The value of outstanding commercial and industrial loans
* The change in the Consumer Price Index for services
* The change in labour cost per unit of output
* The ratio of manufacturing and trade inventories to sales
* The ratio of consumer credit outstanding to personal income
* The average prime rate charged by banks

=== Coincident indicators ===
Coincident indicators change at approximately the same time as the whole economy, thereby providing information about the current state of the economy. There are many coincident economic indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product, industrial production, personal income and retail sales. A coincident index may be used to identify, after the fact, the dates of peaks and troughs in the business cycle.

There are four economic statistics comprising the Index of Coincident Economic Indicators:

* Number of employees on non-agricultural payrolls
* Personal income less transfer payments
* Industrial production
* Manufacturing and trade sale

The Philadelphia Federal Reserve produces state-level coincident indexes based on 4 state-level variables:

* Nonfarm payroll employment
* Average hours worked in manufacturing
* Unemployment rate
* Wage and salary disbursements deflated by the consumer price index (U.S. city average)

==By direction==
There are also three terms that describe an economic indicator&#x27;s &quot;direction&quot; relative to the direction of the general economy:

;Procyclical indicators: move in the same direction as the general economy: they increase when the economy is doing well; decrease when it is doing badly. Gross domestic product (GDP) is a procyclic indicator.
;Countercyclical indicators: move in the opposite direction to the general economy. The unemployment rate and the wage share are countercyclic: in the short run they rise when the economy is deteriorating.
;al indicators: are those with little or no correlation to the business cycle: they may rise or fall when the general economy is doing well, and may rise or fall when it is not doing well.

==Local indicators==
Local governments often need to project future tax revenues. The city of San Francisco, for example, uses the price of a one-bedroom apartment on Craigslist, weekend subway ridership numbers, parking garage usage, and monthly reports on passenger landings at the city&#x27;s airport.

<text>Evelyn Ashford (born April 15, 1957) is an American retired track and field athlete, the 1984 Olympic champion in the 100-meter dash, and the world record-holder in the 60-yard dash. She ran under the 11-second barrier over 30 times and was the first woman to run under 11 seconds in an Olympic Games. Ashford has the distinction of owning the longest unbroken athletics record (60y dash).

==Biography==
As a 19-year-old, Ashford finished fifth in the 100 m event at the 1976 Summer Olympics. After beating the world record holders in the 100 m and 200 m in 1979 at the World Cup of Track and Field in Montreal, Ashford was one of the potential medalists for the 1980 Summer Olympics, but these Games were boycotted by the United States. Ashford also tore a quad muscle in 1980 and was out for the rest of the season.

In 1977, she won the first Broderick Award (now the Honda Sports Award) as the nation&#x27;s best female collegiate track and field athlete.

Ashford was ranked No. 1 in the world by &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; over 100 meters in 1979 and 1981, and over 200 meters in 1981. She also was named Track and Field News &quot;Athlete of the Year&quot; twice, in 1981 and 1984

She again won the sprint double, at the world cup in Rome, in 1981.

On July 3, 1983, she set her first world record for the 100 meters, running 10.79 seconds at the National Sports Festival in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and was one of the favorites to win the 100-meter title at the inaugural World Championships in Helsinki. In the final, however, she pulled a hamstring muscle and fell. The other main favorite, Marlies Göhr of East Germany (who had already beaten Ashford earlier that year), went on to win.

At the 1984 Summer Olympics, Ashford had a chance to win a gold medal. However, she had to withdraw from the 200 m heats with a minor injury. She competed in the 100 m, winning the event in a new Olympic record of 10.97 secs. As the anchor runner for 4 × 100 m relay team, she won a second gold medal. In the absence of World Champions and world record holders East Germany, the US team clocked one of the fastest times in history and won by the biggest margin ever at an Olympics, 1.12 seconds.

Later in the season, she finally defeated her main rival Göhr at the Weltklasse meeting in Zürich, Switzerland. The race saw Ashford make up half a meter or so over Göhr and lower her own world record to 10.76 seconds. That race proved to be Ashford&#x27;s personal record. It still ranks as the No. 13 individual all-time. Ashford regained her No. 1 &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; ranking.

At the 1988 Summer Olympics, she was the flag bearer for the United States team at the Opening Ceremony. She was beaten in the 100 m by Florence Griffith Joyner, who had broken her world record earlier in the season at the Olympic Trials. In the 4 × 100 m relay she again ran the final leg, winning her third Olympic gold medal despite a less than perfect last exchange between Griffith-Joyner and Ashford that required Ashford to run a sensational final leg to overtake Göhr.

At her last Olympics in Barcelona, Ashford, aged 35, was eliminated in the 100 m semi-finals by 1/100 of a second; she went on to win her third straight Olympic 4 × 100 m relay gold, this time running the first leg. She is one of six women to have won four gold medals in track and field Olympic history.

Ashford came back from season-ending injuries three times, to reach the top of the sport in the following year. In 1980 she injured her quad, and returned in 1981 with the sprint double at the World Cup and the number one world ranking in both sprints. After an injury in 1983, she became double Olympic Champion in 1984. In 1987 a hamstring pull prevented her from competing at the World Championships, then a season later added an Olympic Silver and third Gold medal to her collection.

On May 30, 1985, she gave birth to her daughter Raina Ashley Washington, and again came back for an excellent 1986, losing only once over both the 100 m and 200 m, and winning the 100 meter title at the Goodwill Games; earning another No. 1 ranking by &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; over the shorter distance.

After parting ways with her coach Pat Connolly in 1985, Ashford was largely self-coached.

In 1997, Ashford was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, where she is said to be &quot;one of the greatest track and field runners ever&quot;. Ashford went to the University of California, Los Angeles and Roseville High School. She was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 1990.

<text>Thermal conduction is the diffusion of thermal energy (heat) within one material or between materials in contact. The higher temperature object has molecules with more kinetic energy; collisions between molecules distributes this kinetic energy until an object has the same kinetic energy throughout. Thermal conductivity, frequently represented by , is a property that relates the rate of heat loss per unit area of a material to its rate of change of temperature. Essentially, it is a value that accounts for any property of the material that could change the way it conducts heat. Heat spontaneously flows along a temperature gradient (i.e. from a hotter body to a colder body). For example, heat is conducted from the hotplate of an electric stove to the bottom of a saucepan in contact with it. In the absence of an opposing external driving energy source, within a body or between bodies, temperature differences decay over time, and thermal equilibrium is approached, temperature becoming more uniform.

Every process involving heat transfer takes place by only three methods:

# Conduction is heat transfer through stationary matter by physical contact. (The matter is stationary on a macroscopic scale—we know there is thermal motion of the atoms and molecules at any temperature above absolute zero.) Heat transferred between the electric burner of a stove and the bottom of a pan is transferred by conduction.
# Convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a fluid. This type of transfer takes place in a forced-air furnace and in weather systems, for example.
# Heat transfer by radiation occurs when microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, or another form of electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed. An obvious example is the warming of the Earth by the Sun. A less obvious example is thermal radiation from the human body.

==Overview==

A region with greater thermal energy (heat) corresponds with greater molecular agitation. Thus when a hot object touches a cooler surface, the highly agitated molecules from the hot object bump the calm molecules of the cooler surface, transferring the microscopic kinetic energy and causing the colder part or object to heat up. Mathematically, thermal conduction works just like diffusion. As temperature difference goes up, the distance traveled gets shorter or the area goes up thermal conduction increases:
:formula_1
Where:

* formula_2 is the thermal conduction or power (the heat transferred per unit time over some distance between the two temperatures),
* formula_3 is the thermal conductivity of the material,
* formula_4 is the cross-sectional area of the object,
* formula_5 is the difference in temperature from one side to the other,
* formula_6 is the distance over which the heat is transferred.

Conduction is the main mode of heat transfer for solid materials because the strong inter-molecular forces allow the vibrations of particles to be easily transmitted, in comparison to liquids and gases. Liquids have weaker inter-molecular forces and more space between the particles, which makes the vibrations of particles harder to transmit. Gases have even more space, and therefore infrequent particle collisions. This makes liquids and gases poor conductors of heat.

Thermal contact conductance is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact. A temperature drop is often observed at the interface between the two surfaces in contact. This phenomenon is said to be a result of a thermal contact resistance existing between the contacting surfaces. Interfacial thermal resistance is a measure of an interface&#x27;s resistance to thermal flow. This thermal resistance differs from contact resistance, as it exists even at atomically perfect interfaces. Understanding the thermal resistance at the interface between two materials is of primary significance in the study of its thermal properties. Interfaces often contribute significantly to the observed properties of the materials.

The inter-molecular transfer of energy could be primarily by elastic impact, as in fluids, or by free-electron diffusion, as in metals, or phonon vibration, as in insulators. In insulators, the heat flux is carried almost entirely by phonon vibrations.

Metals (e.g., copper, platinum, gold, etc.) are usually good conductors of thermal energy. This is due to the way that metals bond chemically: metallic bonds (as opposed to covalent or ionic bonds) have free-moving electrons that transfer thermal energy rapidly through the metal. The &quot;electron fluid&quot; of a conductive metallic solid conducts most of the heat flux through the solid. Phonon flux is still present but carries less of the energy. Electrons also conduct electric current through conductive solids, and the thermal and electrical conductivities of most metals have about the same ratio. A good electrical conductor, such as copper, also conducts heat well. Thermoelectricity is caused by the interaction of heat flux and electric current. Heat conduction within a solid is directly analogous to diffusion of particles within a fluid, in the situation where there are no fluid currents.

In gases, heat transfer occurs through collisions of gas molecules with one another. In the absence of convection, which relates to a moving fluid or gas phase, thermal conduction through a gas phase is highly dependent on the composition and pressure of this phase, and in particular, the mean free path of gas molecules relative to the size of the gas gap, as given by the Knudsen number formula_7.

To quantify the ease with which a particular medium conducts, engineers employ the thermal conductivity, also known as the conductivity constant or conduction coefficient, &quot;k&quot;. In thermal conductivity, &quot;k&quot; is defined as &quot;the quantity of heat, &quot;Q&quot;, transmitted in time (&quot;t&quot;) through a thickness (&quot;L&quot;), in a direction normal to a surface of area (&quot;A&quot;), due to a temperature difference (Δ&quot;T&quot;) [...]&quot;. Thermal conductivity is a material &quot;property&quot; that is primarily dependent on the medium&#x27;s phase, temperature, density, and molecular bonding. Thermal effusivity is a quantity derived from conductivity, which is a measure of its ability to exchange thermal energy with its surroundings.

===Steady-state conduction===
Steady-state conduction is the form of conduction that happens when the temperature difference(s) driving the conduction are constant, so that (after an equilibration time), the spatial distribution of temperatures (temperature field) in the conducting object does not change any further. Thus, all partial derivatives of temperature &quot;concerning space&quot; may either be zero or have nonzero values, but all derivatives of temperature at any point &quot;concerning time&quot; are uniformly zero. In steady-state conduction, the amount of heat entering any region of an object is equal to the amount of heat coming out (if this were not so, the temperature would be rising or falling, as thermal energy was tapped or trapped in a region).

For example, a bar may be cold at one end and hot at the other, but after a state of steady-state conduction is reached, the spatial gradient of temperatures along the bar does not change any further, as time proceeds. Instead, the temperature remains constant at any given cross-section of the rod normal to the direction of heat transfer, and this temperature varies linearly in space in the case where there is no heat generation in the rod.

In steady-state conduction, all the laws of direct current electrical conduction can be applied to &quot;heat currents&quot;. In such cases, it is possible to take &quot;thermal resistances&quot; as the analog to electrical resistances. In such cases, temperature plays the role of voltage, and heat transferred per unit time (heat power) is the analog of electric current. Steady-state systems can be modeled by networks of such thermal resistances in series and parallel, in exact analogy to electrical networks of resistors. See purely resistive thermal circuits for an example of such a network.

===Transient conduction===

During any period in which temperatures changes &quot;in time&quot; at any place within an object, the mode of thermal energy flow is termed &quot;transient conduction.&quot; Another term is &quot;non-steady-state&quot; conduction, referring to the time-dependence of temperature fields in an object. Non-steady-state situations appear after an imposed change in temperature at a boundary of an object. They may also occur with temperature changes inside an object, as a result of a new source or sink of heat suddenly introduced within an object, causing temperatures near the source or sink to change in time.

When a new perturbation of temperature of this type happens, temperatures within the system change in time toward a new equilibrium with the new conditions, provided that these do not change. After equilibrium, heat flow into the system once again equals the heat flow out, and temperatures at each point inside the system no longer change. Once this happens, transient conduction is ended, although steady-state conduction may continue if heat flow continues.

If changes in external temperatures or internal heat generation changes are too rapid for the equilibrium of temperatures in space to take place, then the system never reaches a state of unchanging temperature distribution in time, and the system remains in a transient state.

An example of a new source of heat &quot;turning on&quot; within an object, causing transient conduction, is an engine starting in an automobile. In this case, the transient thermal conduction phase for the entire machine is over, and the steady-state phase appears, as soon as the engine reaches steady-state operating temperature. In this state of steady-state equilibrium, temperatures vary greatly from the engine cylinders to other parts of the automobile, but at no point in space within the automobile does temperature increase or decrease. After establishing this state, the transient conduction phase of heat transfer is over.

New external conditions also cause this process: for example, the copper bar in the example steady-state conduction experiences transient conduction as soon as one end is subjected to a different temperature from the other. Over time, the field of temperatures inside the bar reaches a new steady-state, in which a constant temperature gradient along the bar is finally set up, and this gradient then stays constant in time. Typically, such a new steady-state gradient is approached exponentially with time after a new temperature-or-heat source or sink, has been introduced. When a &quot;transient conduction&quot; phase is over, heat flow may continue at high power, so long as temperatures do not change.

An example of transient conduction that does not end with steady-state conduction, but rather no conduction, occurs when a hot copper ball is dropped into oil at a low temperature. Here, the temperature field within the object begins to change as a function of time, as the heat is removed from the metal, and the interest lies in analyzing this spatial change of temperature within the object over time until all gradients disappear entirely (the ball has reached the same temperature as the oil). Mathematically, this condition is also approached exponentially; in theory, it takes infinite time, but in practice, it is over, for all intents and purposes, in a much shorter period. At the end of this process with no heat sink but the internal parts of the ball (which are finite), there is no steady-state heat conduction to reach. Such a state never occurs in this situation, but rather the end of the process is when there is no heat conduction at all.

The analysis of non-steady-state conduction systems is more complex than that of steady-state systems. If the conducting body has a simple shape, then exact analytical mathematical expressions and solutions may be possible (see heat equation for the analytical approach). However, most often, because of complicated shapes with varying thermal conductivities within the shape (i.e., most complex objects, mechanisms or machines in engineering) often the application of approximate theories is required, and/or numerical analysis by computer. One popular graphical method involves the use of Heisler Charts.

Occasionally, transient conduction problems may be considerably simplified if regions of the object being heated or cooled can be identified, for which thermal conductivity is very much greater than that for heat paths leading into the region. In this case, the region with high conductivity can often be treated in the lumped capacitance model, as a &quot;lump&quot; of material with a simple thermal capacitance consisting of its aggregate heat capacity. Such regions warm or cool, but show no significant temperature &quot;variation&quot; across their extent, during the process (as compared to the rest of the system). This is due to their far higher conductance. During transient conduction, therefore, the temperature across their conductive regions changes uniformly in space, and as a simple exponential in time. An example of such systems is those that follow Newton&#x27;s law of cooling during transient cooling (or the reverse during heating). The equivalent thermal circuit consists of a simple capacitor in series with a resistor. In such cases, the remainder of the system with a high thermal resistance (comparatively low conductivity) plays the role of the resistor in the circuit.

===Relativistic conduction===
The theory of relativistic heat conduction is a model that is compatible with the theory of special relativity. For most of the last century, it was recognized that the Fourier equation is in contradiction with the theory of relativity because it admits an infinite speed of propagation of heat signals. For example, according to the Fourier equation, a pulse of heat at the origin would be felt at infinity instantaneously. The speed of information propagation is faster than the speed of light in vacuum, which is physically inadmissible within the framework of relativity.

===Quantum conduction===
Second sound is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which heat transfer occurs by wave-like motion, rather than by the more usual mechanism of diffusion. Heat takes the place of pressure in normal sound waves. This leads to a very high thermal conductivity. It is known as &quot;second sound&quot; because the wave motion of heat is similar to the propagation of sound in air.this is called Quantum conduction

==Fourier&#x27;s law==
The law of heat conduction, also known as Fourier&#x27;s law (compare Fourier&#x27;s heat equation), states that the rate of heat transfer through a material is proportional to the negative gradient in the temperature and to the area, at right angles to that gradient, through which the heat flows. We can state this law in two equivalent forms: the integral form, in which we look at the amount of energy flowing into or out of a body as a whole, and the differential form, in which we look at the flow rates or fluxes of energy locally.

Newton&#x27;s law of cooling is a discrete analogue of Fourier&#x27;s law, while Ohm&#x27;s law is the electrical analogue of Fourier&#x27;s law and Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion is its chemical analogue.

===Differential form===
The differential form of Fourier&#x27;s law of thermal conduction shows that the local heat flux density formula_8 is equal to the product of thermal conductivity formula_9 and the negative local temperature gradient formula_10. The heat flux density is the amount of energy that flows through a unit area per unit time.
formula_11
where (including the SI units)
* formula_8 is the local heat flux density, W/m2,
* formula_9 is the material&#x27;s conductivity, W/(m·K),
* formula_14 is the temperature gradient, K/m.

The thermal conductivity formula_9 is often treated as a constant, though this is not always true. While the thermal conductivity of a material generally varies with temperature, the variation can be small over a significant range of temperatures for some common materials. In anisotropic materials, the thermal conductivity typically varies with orientation; in this case formula_9 is represented by a second-order tensor. In non-uniform materials, formula_9 varies with spatial location.

For many simple applications, Fourier&#x27;s law is used in its one-dimensional form, for example, in the direction:
formula_18

In an isotropic medium, Fourier&#x27;s law leads to the heat equation
formula_19
with a fundamental solution famously known as the heat kernel.

===Integral form===
By integrating the differential form over the material&#x27;s total surface formula_20, we arrive at the integral form of Fourier&#x27;s law:

: formula_21

where (including the SI units):
* is the thermal power transferred by conduction (in W), time derivative of the transferred heat formula_22 (in J),
* formula_23 is an oriented surface area element (in m2).

The above differential equation, when integrated for a homogeneous material of 1-D geometry between two endpoints at constant temperature, gives the heat flow rate as
formula_24
where
* formula_25 is the time interval during which the amount of heat formula_22 flows through a cross-section of the material,
* formula_4 is the cross-sectional surface area,
* formula_5 is the temperature difference between the ends,
* formula_29 is the distance between the ends.

One can define the (macroscopic) thermal resistance of the 1-D homogeneous material:
formula_30

With a simple 1-D steady heat conduction equation which is analogous to Ohm&#x27;s law for a simple electric resistance:
formula_31

This law forms the basis for the derivation of the heat equation.

==Conductance==
Writing
formula_32
where is the conductance, in W/(m2 K).

Fourier&#x27;s law can also be stated as:
formula_33

The reciprocal of conductance is resistance, formula_34 is given by:
formula_35

Resistance is additive when several conducting layers lie between the hot and cool regions, because and are the same for all layers. In a multilayer partition, the total conductance is related to the conductance of its layers by:
formula_36 or equivalently formula_37

So, when dealing with a multilayer partition, the following formula is usually used:
formula_38

For heat conduction from one fluid to another through a barrier, it is sometimes important to consider the conductance of the thin film of fluid that remains stationary next to the barrier. This thin film of fluid is difficult to quantify because its characteristics depend upon complex conditions of turbulence and viscosity—but when dealing with thin high-conductance barriers it can sometimes be quite significant.

===Intensive-property representation===
The previous conductance equations, written in terms of extensive properties, can be reformulated in terms of intensive properties. Ideally, the formulae for conductance should produce a quantity with dimensions independent of distance, like Ohm&#x27;s law for electrical resistance, formula_39, and conductance, formula_40.

From the electrical formula: formula_41, where &quot;ρ&quot; is resistivity, &quot;x&quot; is length, and &quot;A&quot; is cross-sectional area, we have formula_42, where &quot;G&quot; is conductance, &quot;k&quot; is conductivity, &quot;x&quot; is length, and &quot;A&quot; is cross-sectional area.

For heat,
formula_43
where is the conductance.

Fourier&#x27;s law can also be stated as:
formula_44
analogous to Ohm&#x27;s law, formula_45 or formula_46

The reciprocal of conductance is resistance, &quot;R&quot;, given by:
formula_47
analogous to Ohm&#x27;s law, formula_48

The rules for combining resistances and conductances (in series and parallel) are the same for both heat flow and electric current.

===Cylindrical shells===
Conduction through cylindrical shells (e.g. pipes) can be calculated from the internal radius, formula_49, the external radius, formula_50, the length, formula_6, and the temperature difference between the inner and outer wall, formula_52.

The surface area of the cylinder is formula_53

When Fourier&#x27;s equation is applied:
formula_54
and rearranged:
formula_55
then the rate of heat transfer is:
formula_56
the thermal resistance is:
formula_57
and formula_58, where formula_59. It is important to note that this is the log-mean radius.

===Spherical===
The conduction through a spherical shell with internal radius, formula_49, and external radius, formula_50, can be calculated in a similar manner as for a cylindrical shell.

The surface area of the sphere is: formula_62

Solving in a similar manner as for a cylindrical shell (see above) produces:
formula_63

==Transient thermal conduction==
===Interface heat transfer===

The heat transfer at an interface is considered a transient heat flow. To analyze this problem, the Biot number is important to understand how the system behaves. The Biot number is determined by:
formula_64
The heat transfer coefficient formula_65, is introduced in this formula, and is measured in formula_66. If the system has a Biot number of less than 0.1, the material behaves according to Newtonian cooling, i.e. with negligible temperature gradient within the body. If the Biot number is greater than 0.1, the system behaves as a series solution. however, there is a noticeable temperature gradient within the material, and a series solution is required to describe the temperature profile. The cooling equation given is:
formula_67
This leads to the dimensionless form of the temperature profile as a function of time:
formula_68
This equation shows that the temperature decreases exponentially over time, with the rate governed by the properties of the material and the heat transfer coefficient.
The heat transfer coefficient, , is measured in formula_69, and represents the transfer of heat at an interface between two materials. This value is different at every interface and is an important concept in understanding heat flow at an interface.

The series solution can be analyzed with a nomogram. A nomogram has a relative temperature as the coordinate and the Fourier number, which is calculated by
formula_70

The Biot number increases as the Fourier number decreases. There are five steps to determine a temperature profile in terms of time.
# Calculate the Biot number
# Determine which relative depth matters, either &quot;x&quot; or &quot;L&quot;.
# Convert time to the Fourier number.
# Convert formula_71 to relative temperature with the boundary conditions.
# Compared required to point to trace specified Biot number on the nomogram.

==Applications==

===Splat cooling===

Splat cooling is a method for quenching small droplets of molten materials by rapid contact with a cold surface. The particles undergo a characteristic cooling process, with the heat profile at formula_72 for initial temperature as the maximum at formula_73 and formula_74 at formula_75 and formula_76, and the heat profile at formula_77 for formula_78 as the boundary conditions. Splat cooling rapidly ends in a steady state temperature, and is similar in form to the Gaussian diffusion equation. The temperature profile, with respect to the position and time of this type of cooling, varies with:
formula_79

Splat cooling is a fundamental concept that has been adapted for practical use in the form of thermal spraying. The thermal diffusivity coefficient, represented as formula_80, can be written as formula_81. This varies according to the material.

===Metal quenching===

Metal quenching is a transient heat transfer process in terms of the time temperature transformation (TTT). It is possible to manipulate the cooling process to adjust the phase of a suitable material. For example, appropriate quenching of steel can convert a desirable proportion of its content of austenite to martensite, creating a very hard and strong product. To achieve this, it is necessary to quench at the &quot;nose&quot; (or eutectic) of the TTT diagram. Since materials differ in their Biot numbers, the time it takes for the material to quench, or the Fourier number, varies in practice. In steel, the quenching temperature range is generally from 600 °C to 200 °C. To control the quenching time and to select suitable quenching media, it is necessary to determine the Fourier number from the desired quenching time, the relative temperature drop, and the relevant Biot number. Usually, the correct figures are read from a standard nomogram. By calculating the heat transfer coefficient from this Biot number, one can find a liquid medium suitable for the application.

==Zeroth law of thermodynamics==

One statement of the so-called zeroth law of thermodynamics is directly focused on the idea of conduction of heat. Bailyn (1994) writes that &quot;the zeroth law may be stated: All diathermal walls are equivalent&quot;.

A diathermal wall is a physical connection between two bodies that allows the passage of heat between them. Bailyn is referring to diathermal walls that exclusively connect two bodies, especially conductive walls.

This statement of the &quot;zeroth law&quot; belongs to an idealized theoretical discourse, and actual physical walls may have peculiarities that do not conform to its generality.

For example, the material of the wall must not undergo a phase transition, such as evaporation or fusion, at the temperature at which it must conduct heat. But when only thermal equilibrium is considered and time is not urgent, so that the conductivity of the material does not matter too much, one suitable heat conductor is as good as another. Conversely, another aspect of the zeroth law is that, subject again to suitable restrictions, a given diathermal wall is indifferent to the nature of the heat bath to which it is connected. For example, the glass bulb of a thermometer acts as a diathermal wall whether exposed to a gas or a liquid, provided that they do not corrode or melt it.

These differences are among the defining characteristics of heat transfer. In a sense, they are symmetries of heat transfer.

== Instruments ==

=== Thermal conductivity analyzer ===
Thermal conduction property of any gas under standard conditions of pressure and temperature is a fixed quantity. This property of a known reference gas or known reference gas mixtures can, therefore, be used for certain sensory applications, such as the thermal conductivity analyzer.

The working of this instrument is by principle based on the Wheatstone bridge containing four filaments whose resistances are matched. Whenever a certain gas is passed over such network of filaments, their resistance changes due to the altered thermal conductivity of the filaments and thereby changing the net voltage output from the Wheatstone Bridge. This voltage output will be correlated with the database to identify the gas sample.

=== Gas sensor ===
The principle of thermal conductivity of gases can also be used to measure the concentration of a gas in a binary mixture of gases.

Working: if the same gas is present around all the Wheatstone bridge filaments, then the same temperature is maintained in all the filaments and hence same resistances are also maintained; resulting in a balanced Wheatstone bridge. However, If the dissimilar gas sample (or gas mixture) is passed over one set of two filaments and the reference gas on the other set of two filaments, then the Wheatstone bridge becomes unbalanced. And the resulting net voltage output of the circuit will be correlated with the database to identify the constituents of the sample gas.

Using this technique many unknown gas samples can be identified by comparing their thermal conductivity with other reference gas of known thermal conductivity. The most commonly used reference gas is nitrogen; as the thermal conductivity of most common gases (except hydrogen and helium) are similar to that of nitrogen.

<text>The premier of the Northwest Territories is a title given to the head of government in the Northwest Territories of Canada when the territory is using an elected system of responsible government. Throughout its history, the territory has been governed by various combinations of locally elected governments and administrators appointed by the government of Canada.

Upon creation, the Northwest Territories were governed by the lieutenant governor of Manitoba, a representative of the federal government and Queen Victoria, for the newly created province of Manitoba. Six years later in 1876, the territory was given its own lieutenant governor, separate from that of Manitoba. These lieutenant governors presided over an assembly with members both elected and appointed by the federal government. Before 1888, the territory required electoral districts with an area of to contain at least 1,000 people. When this quota was met, a by-election was held to elect a member to replace an appointed one.

The Northwest Territories held its first general elections to the North-West Legislative Assembly in 1888 when it considered the population to be sufficient. After this election, the chairman of the assembly&#x27;s executive committee (analogous to a cabinet) assumed the role of head of government. From 1897 to 1905, the chairman used the title &quot;premier&quot;, the same title used by the heads of government in the Canadian provinces.

In 1905, the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta were created from the most populous regions of the Northwest Territories. With a much lower population, powers of the territory&#x27;s head of government reverted to a federal and Crown representative appointed by the prime minister of Canada, this time with the title . Beginning in 1951, and increasingly in 1967, powers were transferred back to an elected assembly. In 1980, the head of this assembly regained the title of premier, and in 1985 the became chair of the Executive Council and full head of government.

Because the Northwest Territories has a consensus government, the premier is elected by, and from, the members of the Legislative Assembly, and are not divided into parties. This list contains only those government leaders who governed under an elected system of responsible government. For the heads of government before and in between these times, see commissioner of the Northwest Territories.

<doc id="72540" wikidata="Q12438" url="?curid=72540" title="Newton (unit)">
<text>The newton (symbol: N) is the unit of force in the International System of Units (SI). Expressed in terms of SI base units, it is 1 kg⋅m/s2, the force that accelerates a mass of one kilogram at one metre per second squared.

The unit is named after Isaac Newton in recognition of his work on classical mechanics, specifically his second law of motion.

== Definition ==
A newton is defined as 1 kg⋅m/s2 (it is a named derived unit defined in terms of the SI base units). One newton is, therefore, the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one metre per second squared in the direction of the applied force.

The units &quot;metre per second squared&quot; can be understood as measuring a rate of change in velocity per unit of time, i.e. an increase in velocity by one metre per second every second.

In 1946, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) Resolution 2 standardized the unit of force in the MKS system of units to be the amount needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one metre per second squared. In 1948, the 9th CGPM Resolution 7 adopted the name &quot;newton&quot; for this force. The MKS system then became the blueprint for today&#x27;s SI system of units. The newton thus became the standard unit of force in the (SI), or International System of Units.

The connection to Newton comes from Newton&#x27;s second law of motion, which states that the force exerted on an object is directly proportional to the acceleration hence acquired by that object, thus:
formula_1
where formula_2 represents the mass of the object undergoing an acceleration formula_3. When using the SI unit of mass, the kilogram (kg), and SI units for distance metre (m), and time, second (s) we arrive at the SI definition of the newton: 1 kg⋅m/s2.

== Examples ==

At average gravity on Earth (conventionally, formula_4 = ), a kilogram mass exerts a force of about 9.81 N. 
* An average-sized apple with mass 200 g exerts about two newtons of force at Earth&#x27;s surface, which we measure as the apple&#x27;s weight on Earth.
: formula_5
* An average adult exerts a force of about 608 N on Earth.
: formula_6 (where 62 kg is the world average adult mass).

== Kilonewtons ==

Large forces may be expressed in kilonewtons (kN), where . For example, the tractive effort of a Class Y steam train locomotive and the thrust of an F100 jet engine are both around 130 kN.

Climbing ropes are tested by assuming a human can withstand a fall that creates 12 kN of force. The ropes must not break when tested against 5 such falls.

<doc id="72542" wikidata="Q889694" url="?curid=72542" title="Hygelac">
<text>Hygelac (; ; ; or &quot;Hugilaicus&quot;; died 516 or 521) was a king of the Geats according to the poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;. It is Hygelac&#x27;s presence in the poem which has allowed scholars to tentatively date the setting of the poem as well as to infer that it contains at least some points of historical fact. &quot;Beowulf&quot; gives Hygelac&#x27;s genealogy: according to the poem, he was the son of Hrethel and had two brothers Herebeald and Hæþcyn, as well as an unnamed sister who was married to Ecgtheow and was the mother of the hero Beowulf. Hygelac was married to Hygd, and they had a son Heardred and an unnamed daughter who married Eofor. When Hygelac&#x27;s brother Hæþcyn was fighting with the Swedes, Hygelac arrived at Hrefnesholt one day too late to save his brother Hæþcyn, but he managed to rescue the surviving Geatish warriors, who were besieged by the Swedish king Ongentheow and his three sons. The Swedes found refuge at a hill fort but were assaulted by the Geats. In the battle, the Swedish king was slain by Eofor. After the death of his brother Herebeald, Hygelac ascended the Geatish throne. After he was killed during a raid on Frisia, Hygelac was succeeded by Heardred, according to &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

==Historical identification==
The raid to Frisia enabled N. F. S. Grundtvig to approximate the date of Hygelac&#x27;s death to c. 516, because a raid to France under a Danish King Chlochilaicus is mentioned by Gregory of Tours. In that source he is recorded as invading the Frankish Kingdoms during the reign of Theodericus I (died 534), the son of Clovis (&quot;Chlodovechus&quot;), the king of the Franks in the early sixth century, and was killed in the ensuing chaos after the Scandinavian raiders were caught by the sudden appearance of a military response force led by Theodericus I’s son, Theodebertus. After the defeat the rest of the survivors took to sea in such disordered haste that they left their dead on the field, including their king. The Franks must have taken back whatever had been taken in pillage as well as spoils of the battlefield; and it is reported by Gregory that they found the corpse of Chlochilaicus so awe-inspiring due his extraordinary height, that, as a pagan barbarian not entitled to burial, his remains were exposed for a long time in the nearest Merovingian Court as a curiosity, following the usual triumphal trophy exhibition customary after battle or pirate captures.

While Gregory calls him a king of the Danes, the much younger &quot;Liber historiae Francorum&quot; instead calls him a king of the Goths (&quot;rege Gotorum&quot;), agreeing with &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

==Transmission to England==
There are two theories on how the account of the Frankish raid came to be preserved in the English epic &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and they have a bearing upon the date assigned to the poem.

===Oral transmission===
One view considers the account to have been kept alive by the oral tradition of heroic poetry until it was included in the &quot;epos&quot;. That Hygelac was known in England already in the early eighth century is seen by the &quot;Liber Monstrorum&quot; (&quot;Book of Monsters&quot;), where he is referred to as &quot;Higlacus&quot;:

Leonard Neidorf argues that the authors of &quot;Beowulf&quot; and the &quot;Liber Monstrorum&quot; must have been relying on a shared oral legendary tradition ultimately stemming from Scandinavia, since they could not have reconstructed the etymologically accurate forms &quot;Higlac&quot; and &quot;Hygelac&quot; based on the garbled Frankish &quot;Chlochilaicus.&quot;

===Literary transmission===
Other scholars have instead suggested that the episode shows that Beowulf was composed as late as the 10th century, the date of the sole surviving manuscript. It has been suggested that the poem is in fact dependent on the &quot;Liber historiae Francorum&quot;, because it mentions the &quot;Attoarii&quot;, which in &quot;Beowulf&quot; become &quot;Hetware&quot;. One scholar considers it to be inconceivable that independent oral tradition would have faithfully transmitted such a detail. German historian Walter Goffart estimated that &quot;Beowulf&quot; could not have been written with these historical details before 923.

<text>North Carolina State University (NC State, North Carolina State, NC State University, or NCSU) is a public land-grant research university in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States. Founded in 1887 and part of the University of North Carolina system, it is the largest university in the Carolinas. The university forms one of the corners of the Research Triangle together with Duke University in Durham and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

The North Carolina General Assembly established North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts on March 7, 1887, as a land-grant college. The college underwent several name changes and officially became North Carolina State University at Raleigh in 1965. However, by longstanding convention, the &quot;at Raleigh&quot; portion is usually omitted. Today, NC State has an enrollment of more than 35,000 students, making it among the largest in the country. NC State has historical strengths in engineering, statistics, agriculture, life sciences, textiles, and design and offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 106 fields of study. The graduate school offers master&#x27;s degrees in 104 fields, doctoral degrees in 61 fields, and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine.

NC State athletic teams are known as the Wolfpack. The name was unofficially adopted in 1921 following an unsigned letter to the NC State &quot;Alumni News&quot; suggesting the moniker &quot;Wolf Pack&quot;. They compete in NCAA Division I and have won ten national championships: four NCAA championships, two AIAW championships, and four titles under other sanctioning bodies.

==History==
The North Carolina General Assembly founded NC State on March 7, 1887, as a land-grant college under the name &quot;North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts,&quot; or &quot;North Carolina A&amp;M&quot; for short. In the segregated system, it was open only to white students. As a land-grant college, North Carolina A&amp;M would provide a liberal and practical education while focusing on military tactics, agriculture, and the mechanical arts without excluding classical studies. Since its founding, the university has maintained these objectives while building on them. After opening in 1889, North Carolina A&amp;M saw its enrollment fluctuate and its mandate expand. In 1917, it changed its name to &quot;North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering&quot;—or &quot;North Carolina State&quot; for short. During the Great Depression, the North Carolina state government, under Governor O. Max Gardner, administratively combined the University of North Carolina, the Woman&#x27;s College (now the University of North Carolina at Greensboro), and NC State. This conglomeration became the University of North Carolina in 1931. In 1937, Blake R. Van Leer joined as Dean and started the graduate program for engineering, among numerous other programs. In 1942, Van Leer successfully encouraged NC State&#x27;s first women to pursue an engineering degree, 4-5 women would enroll and the first women graduated in 1941. One of his students Katharine Stinson became the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s first female engineer. Following World War II, the university grew and developed. The G.I. Bill enabled thousands of veterans to attend college, and enrollment shot past the 5,000 mark in 1947.

State College created new academic programs, including the School of Architecture and Landscape Design in 1947 (renamed as the School of Design in 1948), the School of Education in 1948, and the School of Forestry in 1950. In the summer of 1956, following the US Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) that segregated public education was unconstitutional, North Carolina State College enrolled its first African-American undergraduates, Ed Carson, Manuel Crockett, Irwin Holmes, and Walter Holmes. In 1962, State College officials desired to change the institution&#x27;s name to North Carolina State University. Consolidated university administrators approved a change to the University of North Carolina at Raleigh, frustrating many students and alumni who protested the change with letter writing campaigns. In 1963, State College officially became North Carolina State of the University of North Carolina. Students, faculty, and alumni continued to express dissatisfaction with this name; however, after two additional years of protest, the name was changed to the current official name, North Carolina State University at Raleigh. However, by longstanding convention, the &quot;at Raleigh&quot; portion is omitted even in official documents such as diplomas, and in practice the institution&#x27;s name is simply &quot;North Carolina State University&quot;; &quot;NC State University&quot; is also accepted on first reference in news stories. Indeed, school officials have long discouraged using &quot;at Raleigh&quot; except when absolutely necessary, as the full name implies that there is another branch of the university elsewhere in the state.

In 1966, single-year enrollment reached 10,000. In the 1970s enrollment surpassed 19,000 and the School of Humanities and Social Sciences was added.

Celebrating its centennial in 1987, NC State reorganized its internal structure, renaming all its schools to colleges (e.g. School of Engineering to the College of Engineering). Also in this year, it gained of land that was developed as Centennial Campus. Since then, NC State has focused on developing its new Centennial Campus. It has invested more than $620 million in facilities and infrastructure at the new campus, with of space being constructed. Sixty-one private and government agency partners are on Centennial Campus.

NC State has almost 8,000 employees, nearly 35,000 students, a $1.495 billion annual budget, and a $1.4 billion endowment. It is the largest university in the state and one of the anchors of North Carolina&#x27;s Research Triangle, together with Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In 2009, NCSU canceled a planned appearance by the Dalai Lama to speak on its Raleigh campus, citing concerns about a Chinese backlash and a shortage of time and resources.

NCSU Libraries Special Collections Research Center, in D.H. Hill Library, maintains a website devoted to NC State history entitled &quot;Historical State&quot;.

In October 2023, Polychlorinated biphenyl was detected in Poe Hall. Poe Hall was immediately closed to the public. The Campus Community Alliance for Environment Justice, a student-led coalition, was formed to petition the college for increased transparency. 

==Campuses==
===Main campus===
NC State&#x27;s Main Campus has three sub-campuses: North Campus, Central Campus, and South Campus. North Campus is the oldest part of NC State and is home to most academic departments and a few residence halls. Central Campus is mainly residence halls, cafeterias, gymnasiums and student support facilities. Finally, Greek Court, the McKimmon Conference and Training Center, and student park-and-ride areas are found on South Campus. North and Central Campus are separated by the North Carolina Railroad. Pedestrian tunnels allow students to commute between campuses. Central and South Campuses are separated by Western Boulevard, a major downtown artery. University Housing divides Main Campus into West, Central, and East Campus for residence hall purposes. West and Central campuses are divided by Dan Allen Drive, while Central and East are divided by Morill Drive and Reynolds Coliseum.

Architecturally, Main Campus is known for its distinctive red brick buildings. Brick statues dot the landscape, and the University Plaza, colloquially named &quot;The Brickyard&quot;, in North Campus is nicknamed for its paving material; most sidewalks are also made from brick. The Brickyard and sidewalks also contain white brick mosaics of the athletics logo and other patterns.

The Memorial Belltower, located in the Northeast corner of North Campus, serves as the signature of NC State and appears in the NC State Chancellor&#x27;s Seal. It was constructed as a monument to alumni killed in World War I. The granite tower, completed in 1937, is 115 feet (35 m) tall. As a tradition, the Belltower is lit in red at night immediately following athletic victories and certain academic achievements.
The Court of North Carolina, just west of the Memorial Belltower, is surrounded by the 1911 Building; the College of Humanities and Social Sciences in Tompkins, Caldwell, Winston Halls and The College of Education in Poe Hall; Page Hall, home to College of Engineering offices; and Leazar Hall, former location of the Computer Science Teaching Labs. It was once home to 100 trees (one for every county in North Carolina), but damage caused by Hurricane Fran in 1996 reduced the number significantly, including the destruction of a particularly old and large tree which was some in diameter. Some replanting has occurred, but the Court&#x27;s former appearance is far from being restored.

Southwest of the Court of North Carolina is another landmark, the Free Expression Tunnel. The Tunnel functions as one of three pedestrian tunnels underneath the railroad tracks separating North Campus and Central Campus. This particular tunnel is the site of sanctioned graffiti; anyone may paint there, and it is often the place for political statements, personal messages, and art. This tunnel also serves as a way to advertise events going on around campus. In 2008, racist and threatening graffiti in the tunnel directed at then President-elect Barack Obama prompted an investigation from the United States Secret Service. Students held a &quot;Unity Rally&quot; in response to denounce the acts of racism.

The Wolfline bus service connects points on the campuses with each other. It also provides transportation to collegiate athletic events.

===Centennial===

NC State&#x27;s main campus is augmented by the mixed-use Centennial Campus. Located south of the Memorial Tower, this campus houses university, corporate, and government research, in addition to classrooms and non-student residences. The Wilson College of Textiles has been based on this campus since 1991. Beginning in 2002, the College of Engineering began to relocate to Centennial Campus. Six of the nine College of Engineering departments are housed in three Engineering Buildings in an area known as the Engineering Oval. The Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC), part of the College of Engineering, is located adjacent to the Engineering Oval.

The 110,000-square-foot Randall B. Terry Jr. Companion Animal Veterinary Medical Center, completed in 2011, doubled the size of the veterinary hospital.

J. C. Raulston Arboretum is an arboretum and botanical garden operated by NC State, and located just south of West Campus. It is open daily without charge.

===NC Research Campus===

NC State is one of eight universities with a presence at the North Carolina Research Campus, a 340-acre biotechnology hub in Kannapolis, NC The university operates the Plants for Human Health Institute (PHHI), a research and education organization devoted to research involving food crops, like fruits and vegetables, and the potential health-promoting properties they convey when consumed. NC State&#x27;s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences staffs the institute with faculty from the departments of horticultural science; food, bioprocessing and nutrition sciences; plant and microbial biology; genetics; and agricultural and resource economics.

PHHI has both research and Cooperative Extension components. Mary Ann Lila is director of the Plants for Human Health Institute. As of February 2024, PHHI is home to around 11 faculty and 70 staff at the NC Research Campus.

NC State began operations in Kannapolis in 2007 as the Fruit and Vegetable Science Institute. The university was one of the first organizations to join the fledgling biotech hub that would become the NC Research Campus. The university&#x27;s program was renamed the Plants for Human Health Institute when the NC Research Campus was officially dedicated on October 20, 2008, in order &quot;to more accurately reflect the groundbreaking research approach the institute will take. Institute research will focus on identifying and making available to consumers bioactive compounds in plants that prevent and treat disease.&quot;

===Sustainability===
In March 2008, NC State launched the University Sustainability Office in order to address environmental concerns on campus. The university has established a commitment to reduce its annual energy consumption per square foot by at least 4% over a 10-year period. In addition, the university has surpassed the Executive Order 156 goal of diverting 40 percent of their solid waste stream from the landfill through a variety of campus reuse and recycling programs. NC State incorporates locally grown, organic, and free range foods into dining service meals at several events such as Earth Week&#x27;s EarthFest and the annual All Carolinas Meal with foods local to the Carolinas.

Examinations of the campus&#x27; sustainability practices by the Sustainable Endowments Institute resulted in a &quot;B+&quot; grade for NC State on the College Sustainability Report Card 2011. In 2013 the University Housing department agreed to incorporate a new living and learning community known as &quot;EcoVillage.&quot; Members of EcoVillage were originally housed in Bragaw Residence Hall on West Campus. Today, EcoVillage is housed in the adjacent Lee Residence Hall. Members of EcoVillage complete numerous volunteer based sustainability trips every semester and attend various discussions about how to improve and further the university&#x27;s reach into sustainability.

==Academics==
===Structure===

NC State is one of 17 institutions that constitute the University of North Carolina system. Each campus has a high degree of independence, but each submits to the policies of the UNC system board of governors. The 32 voting members of the board of governors are elected by the North Carolina General Assembly for four-year terms. President Peter Hans heads the system.

The board of trustees of NC State has thirteen members and sets all policies for the university. The UNC system board of governors elects eight of the trustees and the governor of North Carolina appoints four. The student body president serves on the board of trustees as a voting member. The UNC system also elects the chancellor of NC State, currently Randy Woodson.

The board of trustees administers NC State&#x27;s eleven academic colleges. Each college grants its own degrees with the exception of the First Year College which provides incoming freshmen the opportunity to experience several disciplines before selecting a major. The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences is the only college to offer associate degrees and the College of Veterinary Medicine does not grant undergraduate degrees. Each college is composed of numerous departments that focus on a particular discipline or degree program, for example Food Science, Civil Engineering, Genetics or Accounting. There are a total of 66 departments administered by all eleven NC State colleges.

In total, NC State offers nine associate degree programs in agriculture, bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 102 areas of study, master&#x27;s degrees in 108 areas, and doctorate degrees in 60 areas. NC State is known for its programs in agriculture, engineering, textiles, and design. The textile and paper engineering programs are notable, given the uniqueness of the subject area.

Most NC State fans and athletes recognize the rivalry with the North Carolina Tar Heels as their biggest. NC State was a founding member of the Southern Conference and of the Atlantic Coast Conference, and it is one of the four teams on &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;.

The primary logo for NC State athletics is a red block &#x27;S&#x27; with an inscribed &#x27;N&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27;. The block S has been in use since 1890 but has seen many alterations through the years. It became the sole logo for all NC State athletic teams in 2000 and was modernized to its current design in 2006.

NC State athletic teams are nicknamed the &#x27;Wolfpack&#x27; (most women&#x27;s teams are also called the &quot;Wolfpack,&quot; except for the women&#x27;s basketball team who go by the &quot;Wolfpack Women&quot;). The name was unofficially adopted in 1921 following an unsigned letter to the NC State &quot;Alumni News&quot; suggesting the moniker &quot;Wolf Pack&quot;. Prior to the adoption of the current nickname, NC State athletic teams went by such names as the Aggies, the Techs, and the Red Terrors. Since the 1960s the Wolfpack has been represented at athletic events by its mascots, Mr. and Mrs. Wuf. In print, the &#x27;Strutting Wolf&#x27; is used and is known by the name &#x27;Tuffy.&#x27;

<text>Neeltje Jans () is an artificial island in the Netherlands in the province of Zeeland, halfway between Noord-Beveland and Schouwen-Duiveland in the Oosterschelde. It was constructed to facilitate the construction of the Oosterscheldedam.

After the construction, a fun park with attractions and other various expositions were built on the island, which are now connected to the shore through the dam. Another addition of the island is a nature reserve.

The island was named after a nearby sand bank. The name of this sandbank has two possible origins:
* It could be named after a boat with the name Neeltje Jans, stranded on the sandbank. Neeltje is a Dutch first name (a diminutive from Cornelia or Neelie like in Neelie Kroes). Jans is a familiar surname (meaning a son or daughter of Jan).
*It could be named after a goddess of the sea, Nehalennia.

The second stage of the 2015 Tour de France finished on Neeltje Jans on 5 July 2015.

<doc id="72554" wikidata="Q1635030" url="?curid=72554" title="Sound bite">
<text>A sound bite or soundbite is a short clip of speech or music extracted from a longer piece of audio, often used to promote or exemplify the full length piece. In the context of journalism, a sound bite is characterized by a short phrase or sentence that captures the essence of what the speaker was trying to say, and is used to summarize information and entice the reader or viewer. The term was coined by the U.S. media in the 1970s. Since then, politicians have increasingly employed sound bites to summarize their positions, gone out of their way to prevent sound bites being made from interview audio and video.

Due to its brevity, the sound bite often overshadows the broader context in which it was spoken, and can be misleading or inaccurate. The insertion of sound bites into news broadcasts or documentaries is open to manipulation, leading to conflict over journalistic ethics.

== History ==

In the 1960s and 1970s, pressure from advertisers on the American television industry to create entertaining news material made sound bites central to political coverage. Politicians began to use PR techniques to craft self-images and slogans that would resonate with the television-viewing audience and ensure their victory in campaigns. The term &quot;sound bite&quot; was coined in the late 1970s, several years before the presidency of Ronald Reagan, who was famous for short, memorable phrases like, &quot;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!&quot; in reference to the Berlin Wall.

During the 1988 United States presidential election, candidate Michael Dukakis highlighted the prominent role of sound bites and spin doctors in political campaigns by running a commercial that mocked contender George H. W. Bush&#x27;s handlers&#x27; frustration over the gaffes of his vice presidential running-mate Dan Quayle.

== Journalism ==

In journalism, sound bites are used to summarize the position of the speaker, as well as to increase the interest of the reader or viewer in the piece. In both print and broadcast journalism, sound bites are conventionally juxtaposed and interspersed with commentary from the journalist to create a news story. A balanced news report is expected to contain sound bites representing both sides of the debate. This technique, however, can lead to biased reporting when a sound bite is selected for sensationalism, or is used to promote the point of view of one individual or group over another.

== Impact ==

In his book &quot;The Sound Bite Society&quot;, Jeffrey Scheuer argues that the sound bite was the product of television&#x27;s increased power over all forms of communication, and that the resulting trend toward short, catchy snippets of information had a significant negative impact on American political discourse. In contrast, Peggy Noonan feels that sound bites have acquired a negative connotation but are not inherently negative, and that what we now think of as great historical sound bites—such as &quot;The only thing we have to fear is fear itself&quot;, the most famous phrase in Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s first Inaugural Address—were examples of eloquent speakers unselfconsciously and &quot;simply trying in words to capture the essence of the thought they wished to communicate.&quot;

The increased use of sound bites in news media has been criticized, and has led to discussions on journalistic and media ethics. According to the Code of Ethics of the Society of Professional Journalists, journalists should &quot;make certain that headlines, news teases and promotional material, photos, video, audio, graphics, sound bites and quotations do not misrepresent. They should not oversimplify or highlight incidents out of context.&quot;

Despite this criticism, sound bites are widely employed by businesses, trade groups, labor unions and politicians. Senator Jim DeMint readily admitted this when he said, &quot;There’s a reason why most politicians talk in sanitized sound bites: Once you get out of that, you’re opening yourself up to get attacked.&quot;

* Ash heap of history 
* Axis of evil 
* Ever closer union 
* Evil Empire speech 
* Make America Great Again
* Manifest destiny 
* Peace for our time 
* Read my lips: no new taxes
* Shock and awe 
* War on terror 
* Weapons of mass destruction

<doc id="72563" wikidata="Q1821972" url="?curid=72563" title="Lew Allen">
<text>Lew Allen Jr. (30 September 1925 – 4 January 2010) was a United States Air Force four-star general who served as the tenth Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force. As chief of staff, Allen served as the senior uniformed Air Force officer responsible for the organization, training, and equipping of 750,000 active duty Air Force, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and civilian personnel serving in the United States and overseas. As a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he and the other service chiefs function(ed) as the military advisers to the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Council, and the president.

==Early life and education==
Born in Miami, Florida, Allen attended and graduated from high school in Gainesville, Texas, in 1942. He entered the United States Military Academy, in 1943, and he graduated in 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and a commission as a second lieutenant. He was awarded his pilot&#x27;s wings upon his graduation from flight training.

==Military career==

After completing multi-engine flight training in November 1946, Allen was assigned to Strategic Air Command&#x27;s 7th Bombardment Group at Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, where he flew B-29 Superfortress bombers, and then the new and very long-range Convair B-36 bomber. Allen also served in various technical positions in the area of nuclear weapons. Allen also attended the Air Tactical Course at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, and next he returned to Carswell Air Force Base as a flight instructor and as an assistant Special Weapons Officer for the 7th Bombardment Wing.

In September 1950, Allen entered the University of Illinois for graduate study in nuclear physics. He completed his Master of Science degree in 1952. Allen continued his graduate study, and he earned his PhD in physics in 1954. He had completed an experimental thesis on high-energy photonuclear reactions. Allen then was assigned to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, as a physicist in the Test Division, where he became acquainted with the bomb designer Ted Taylor. Allen conducted experiments in several different nuclear test series. These experiments concerned the physics of thermonuclear weapons design and to the effects of high altitude nuclear explosions conceivably to be used for ballistic missile defense.

From June 1957 to December 1961, Allen was assigned to Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, as the science adviser to the Physics Division of the Air Force Special Weapons Center. (&quot;Special weapons&quot; is a euphemism for nuclear and thermonuclear bombs.) Allen specialized in the military effects of high altitude nuclear explosions and participated in several nuclear weapons test series. He was scientific director of a major experiment that utilized a large series of high-altitude rockets to measure the characteristics of electrons trapped in the geomagnetic field after an exoatmospheric nuclear burst.

Allen was assigned in December 1961 to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Space Technology Office, in the Directorate of Research and Engineering, Washington, D.C. From June 1965 to February 1973, he was assigned to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, initially in Los Angeles, California, as the deputy director for advanced plans in the Directorate of Special Projects. Allen next moved to The Pentagon in June 1968 as the deputy director of space systems, and in June 1969, he became the director. He returned to Los Angeles in September 1970 as the assistant to the director of special projects and in April 1971 became the director of special projects, with additional duty as the deputy commander for satellite programs of the Space and Missile Systems Organization.

After serving briefly as the chief of staff for the Air Force Systems Command at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, Allen was appointed in March 1973 as a deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence for the Intelligence Community in Washington, D.C. In August 1973, Allen became the director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the chief of the Central Security Service at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Allen&#x27;s tenure as the NSA director was noteworthy in that he became the first director to ever testify publicly before Congress. In August 1977, he was named commander of Air Force Systems Command.

Allen served as the Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force from April 1978 until he became the Chief of Staff of the Air Force in July 1978. His nomination was unusual in that he had never served in an overseas or combat assignment, and most of his positions were in specialized technical activities, rather than in the usual command structure of the Air Force. Also, he was the last chief of staff with a bomber background; all subsequent chiefs of staff except General Norton Schwartz have been fighter pilots, and this trend is reflected by the Service&#x27;s weapon budgets, which devote most funding to fighters rather than bombers.

==Retirement==
Allen did not believe that crewed spaceflight was useful. He reportedly told a Manned Spaceflight Engineer that he had helped cancel Manned Orbiting Laboratory in the 1960s, and would have canceled the Space Shuttle program. Following his retirement from the Air Force in 1982, Allen became the director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), during part of the Voyager Program (space probes launched in 1977), and he served as the Director of the JPL until 1990.

Allen was a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the Council on Foreign Relations.

From 1993 to 1995, Allen served as a member of the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) and the Intelligence Oversight Board.

Allen was awarded the 1999 Distinguished Graduate Award of the Association of Graduates, the alumni association of West Point graduates.

Allen died in Potomac Falls, Virginia, on 4 January 2010, of complications from rheumatoid arthritis. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on March 22, 2010.

==Legacy==
The United States Air Force created the General Lew Allen, Jr. Trophy in Allen&#x27;s honor, which is awarded annually to an Officer and a Senior NCO in the aircraft maintenance or munitions career fields directly involved with setting up aircraft sorties.

In 1983, Allen received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Since 1986, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory awards in his honor the &quot;Lew Allen Award for Excellence&quot;, until 1990 called the &quot;Director&#x27;s Research Achievement Award&quot;.

Minor planet 4125 Lew Allen is named in his honor.

<doc id="72566" wikidata="Q157150" url="?curid=72566" title="Carmina Burana">
<text>Carmina Burana (, Latin for &quot;Songs from Benediktbeuern&quot; [&quot;Buria&quot; in Latin]) is a manuscript of 254 poems and dramatic texts mostly from the 11th or 12th century, although some are from the 13th century. The pieces are mostly bawdy, irreverent, and satirical. They were written principally in Medieval Latin, a few in Middle High German and old Arpitan. Some are macaronic, a mixture of Latin and German or French vernacular.

They were written by students and clergy when Latin was the lingua franca throughout Italy and western Europe for travelling scholars, universities, and theologians. Most of the poems and songs appear to be the work of Goliards, clergy (mostly students) who satirized the Catholic Church. The collection preserves the works of a number of poets, including Peter of Blois, Walter of Châtillon and an anonymous poet referred to as the Archpoet.

The collection was found in 1803 in the Benedictine monastery of Benediktbeuern, Bavaria, and is now housed in the Bavarian State Library in Munich. It is considered to be the most important collection of Goliard and vagabond songs, along with the &quot;Carmina Cantabrigiensia&quot;.

The manuscripts reflect an international European movement, with songs originating from Occitania, France, England, Scotland, Aragon, Castile and the Holy Roman Empire.

Twenty-four poems in &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; were set to music in 1936 by Carl Orff as &quot;Carmina Burana: Cantiones profanae cantoribus et choris cantandae comitantibus instrumentis atque imaginibus magicis&quot;. His composition quickly became popular and a staple piece of the classical music repertoire. The opening and closing movement &quot;O Fortuna&quot; has been used in numerous films, becoming one of the most recognizable compositions in popular culture.

==Manuscript==
&quot;Carmina Burana&quot; (CB) is a manuscript written in 1230 by two different scribes in an early gothic minuscule on 119 sheets of parchment. A number of free pages, cut of a slightly different size, were attached at the end of the text in the 14th century. At some point in the Late Middle Ages, the handwritten pages were bound into a small folder called the &quot;Codex Buranus&quot;. However, in the process of binding, the text was placed partially out of order, and some pages were most likely lost, as well. The manuscript contains eight miniatures: the &quot;rota fortunae&quot; (which actually is an illustration from songs CB 14–18, but was placed by the book binder as the cover), an imaginative forest, a pair of lovers, scenes from the story of Dido and Aeneas, a scene of drinking beer, and three scenes of playing dice, tables, and chess.
===History===
Older research assumed that the manuscript was written in Benediktbeuern where it was found. Today, however, &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; scholars have several different ideas about the manuscript&#x27;s place of origin. It is agreed that the manuscript must be from the region of central Europe where the Bavarian dialect of German is spoken due to the Middle High German phrases in the text—a region that includes parts of southern Germany, western Austria, and northern Italy. It must also be from the southern part of that region because of the Italian peculiarities of the text. The two possible locations of its origin are the bishop&#x27;s seat of Seckau in Styria and Neustift Abbey near Brixen in South Tyrol.

A bishop named Heinrich was provost in Seckau from 1232 to 1243, and he is mentioned as provost of Maria Saal in Carinthia in CB 6* of the added folio. This would support Seckau as the possible point of origin, and it is possible that Heinrich funded the creation of the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. The &quot;marchiones&quot; (people from Steiermark) were mentioned in CB 219,3 before the Bavarians, Saxons, or Austrians, presumably indicating that Steiermark was the location closest to the writers. Many of the hymns were dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who was venerated in Seckau, such as CB 12* and 19*–22*.

In support of Kloster Neustift, the text&#x27;s open-mindedness is characteristic of the reform-minded Augustine Canons Regular of the time, as is the spoken quality of the writing. Also, Brixen is mentioned in CB 95, and the beginning to a story appears in CB 203a which is unique to Tirol called the &quot;Eckenlied&quot; about the mythic hero Dietrich von Bern.

It is less clear how the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; traveled to Benediktbeuern. Fritz Peter Knapp suggested that the manuscript could have traveled in 1350 by way of the Wittelsbacher family who were Vögte of both Tirol and Bavaria, if it was written in Neustift.

===Themes===
Generally, the works contained in the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; can be arranged into four groups according to theme:
# 55 songs of morals and mockery (CB 1–55)
# 131 love songs (CB 56–186)
# 40 drinking and gaming songs (CB 187–226)
# two longer spiritual theater pieces (CB 227 and 228)

This outline, however, has many exceptions. CB 122–134, which are categorized as love songs, actually are not: they contain a song for mourning the dead, a satire, and two educational stories about the names of animals. Another group of spiritual poems may have been included in the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; and since lost. The attached folio contains a mix of 21 generally spiritual songs: a prose-prayer to Saint Erasmus and four more spiritual plays, some of which have only survived as fragments. These larger thematic groups can also be further subdivided, for example, the end of the world (CB 24–31), songs about the crusades (CB 46–52) or reworkings of writings from antiquity (CB 97–102).

Other frequently recurring themes include: critiques of simony and greed in the church, that, with the advent of the monetary economy in the 12th century, rapidly became an important issue (CB 1–11, 39, 41–45); lamentations in the form of the planctus, for example about the ebb and flow of human fate (CB 14–18) or about death (CB 122–131); the hymnic celebration of the return of spring (CB 132, 135, 137, 138, 161 and others); pastourelles about the rape/seduction of shepherdesses by knights, students/clergymen (CB 79, 90, 157–158); and the description of love as military service (CB 60, 62, and 166), a topos known from Ovid&#x27;s elegiac love poems. Ovid and especially his erotic elegies were reproduced, imitated and exaggerated in the &quot;Carmina Burana.&quot; Following Ovid, depictions of sexual intercourse in the manuscript are frank and sometimes aggressive. CB 76, for example, makes use of the first-person narrative to describe a ten-hour love act with the goddess of love herself, Venus.
The &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; contains numerous poetic descriptions of a raucous medieval paradise (CB 195–207, 211, 217, 219), for which the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, known for his advocation of the blissful life, is even taken as an authority on the subject (CB 211). CB 219 describes, for example, an &quot;ordo vagorum&quot; (vagrant order) to which people from every land and clerics of all rankings were invited—even &quot;presbyter cum sua matrona,&quot; or &quot;a priest with his lady wife&quot; (humorous because Catholic priests must swear an oath of celibacy). CB 215 even provides an example of the religious rites of this order, the &quot;Officium lusorum&quot;, the &quot;Service&quot;, or &quot;Mass&quot;, &quot;of the Gamblers&quot;. In this parody world, the rules of priesthood include sleeping in, eating heavy food and drinking rich wine, and regularly playing dice games. These rules were described in such detail that older research on the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; took these descriptions literally and assumed there actually existed such a lazy order of priests. In fact, though, this outspoken reverie of living delights and freedom from moral obligations shows &quot;an attitude towards life and the world that stands in stark contrast to the firmly established expectations of life in the Middle Ages&quot;. The literary researcher Christine Kasper considers this description of a bawdy paradise as part of the early history of the European story of the land of Cockaigne: in CB 222 the &quot;abbas Cucaniensis&quot;, or Abbot of Cockaigne, is said to have presided over a group of dice players.

===Authors===
Almost nothing is known about the authors of the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. Only a few songs can be ascribed to specific authors, such as those by Hugh Primas of Orléans (died ), by the Archpoet (died ), by Frenchman Walter of Châtillon (died ), and by Breton Petrus Blesensis (died ). Additionally, the attached folio contains German stanzas that mention specific authors, so they can be ascribed to German Minnesinger Dietmar von Aist (died ), to Heinrich von Morungen (died ), to Walther von der Vogelweide (died ), and to Neidhart (died ). The only signed poems are contained in the attached folio, and they are by the so-called Marner, a wandering poet and singer from Swabia. Many poems stem from works written in Classical antiquity by Ovid, Horace, Juvenal, and Ausonius; however, about two-thirds of the poems appear not to be derivative works.

The text is mostly an anonymous work, and it appears to have been written by Goliards and vagrants who were either theology students travelling between universities or clerics who had not yet received a prebendary. Presumably these individuals scrounged and begged for a living, which might explain why a good portion of the moral songs are dedicated to condemning those who are not generous alms givers (e.g., CB 3, 9, 11, and 19–21). The authors demonstrate a broad knowledge of ancient mythology, which they employ to rich effect through metonymy and allegorical references, and which they effortlessly weave into scenes from the Bible. &quot;Lyaeus&quot;, for example, the mythical god of wine (Dionysus), casually makes an appearance at the Marriage at Cana in CB 194 where Jesus performed the miracle of transforming water into wine ().

==Rediscovery and history of publication==
The manuscript was discovered in the monastery at Benediktbeuern in 1803 by librarian . He transferred it to the Bavarian State Library in Munich where it currently resides (Signatur: clm 4660/4660a). Aretin regarded the Codex as his personal reading material, and wrote to a friend that he was glad to have discovered &quot;a collection of poetic and prosaic satire, directed mostly against the papal seat&quot;.

The first pieces to be published were Middle-High German texts, which Aretin&#x27;s colleague published in 1806. Additional pieces were eventually published by Jacob Grimm in 1844. The first collected edition of the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; was not published until 1847, almost 40 years after Aretin&#x27;s discovery. Publisher Johann Andreas Schmeller chose a misleading title for the collection, which created the misconception that the works contained in the &quot;Codex Buranas&quot; were not from Benediktbeuern. Schmeller attempted to organize the collection into &quot;joking&quot; (&quot;Scherz&quot;) and &quot;serious&quot; (&quot;Ernst&quot;) works, but he never fully completed the task. The ordering scheme used today was proposed in 1930 by and in the first critical text edition of the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. The two based their edition on previous work by Munich philologist Wilhelm Meyer, who discovered that some pages of the &quot;Codex Buranus&quot; had mistakenly been bound into other old books. He also was able to revise illegible portions of the text by comparing them to similar works.

==Musical settings==
About one-quarter of the poems in the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; are accompanied in the manuscript by music using unheighted, staffless neumes, an archaic system of musical notation that by the time of the manuscript had largely been superseded by staffed neumes. Unheighted neumes only indicate whether a given note is pitched higher or lower than the preceding note, without giving any indication of how much change in pitch there is between two notes, so they are useful only as mnemonic devices for singers who are already familiar with the melody. However, it is possible to identify many of those melodies by comparing them with melodies notated in staffed neumes in other contemporary manuscripts from the schools of Notre Dame and Saint Martial.

Between 1935 and 1936, German composer Carl Orff composed music, also called &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, for 24 of the poems. The single song &quot;O Fortuna&quot; (the Roman goddess of luck and fate), from the movement &quot;Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi&quot;, is often heard in many popular settings such as films. Orff&#x27;s composition has been performed by many ensembles.
Other musical settings include: 
* 1584: A sanitized version of &quot;Tempus adest floridum&quot; was published in the Finnish collection &quot;Piae Cantiones.&quot; The &quot;Piae Cantiones&quot; version includes a melody recognizable to modern audiences as the one that is now used for the Christmas carol &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;.
* 1975–1978: The Clemencic Consort recorded in 1974–1977 five LPs of songs from &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;.
* 1983: The album &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; by Ray Manzarek, keyboard player for The Doors, produced by Philip Glass and Kurt Munkacsi; arrangements by Ray Manzarek. A&amp;M Records.
* 1991: Apotheosis, a techno group from Belgium, produced their first single, &quot;O Fortuna&quot;, in 1991, which heavily sampled the classical piece originally composed by Carl Orff. However, the estate of Carl Orff (who died in 1982) took legal action in court to stop the distribution of the records on the grounds of copyright infringement. Judgment was finally accorded to the estate.
* 1997: Japanese composer Nobuo Uematsu used portions of &quot;O Fortuna&quot;, &quot;Estuans interius&quot;, &quot;Veni, veni, venias&quot;, and &quot;Ave formosissima&quot; for the final boss theme &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot; in Square Enix&#x27;s game &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;.
* 1998: Composer John Paul used a portion of the lyrics of &quot;Fas et nefas ambulant&quot; in the musical score of the video game &quot;Gauntlet Legends&quot;.
* 2005: German band Corvus Corax recorded &quot;Cantus Buranus&quot;, a full-length opera, set to the original &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; manuscript in 2005, and released &quot;Cantus Buranus II&quot; in 2008
* 2009: The Trans-Siberian Orchestra included the song &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; on their album &quot;Night Castle&quot;.

<text>Passy Cemetery () is a small cemetery in Passy, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, France.

==History==
The current cemetery replaced the old cemetery (&quot;l&#x27;ancien cimetière communal de Passy&quot;, located on Rue Lekain), which was closed in 1802.

In the early 19th century, on the orders of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, all the cemeteries in Paris were replaced by several large new ones outside the precincts of the capital. Montmartre Cemetery was built in the north, Père Lachaise Cemetery in the east, and Montparnasse Cemetery in the south. Passy Cemetery was a later addition, but has its origins in the same edict.

The current entrance (designed by René Berger) was built in 1934. The retaining wall of the cemetery is adorned with a bas relief (by Louis Janthial) commemorating the soldiers who fell in World War I.

==Notes==
Opened in 1820 in the expensive residential and commercial districts of the Right Bank near the &quot;Champs-Élysées&quot;, by 1874 the small Passy Cemetery had become the aristocratic necropolis of Paris. It is the only cemetery in Paris to have a heated waiting-room.

Sheltered by a bower of chestnut trees, the cemetery is in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower.

The cemetery was once the home of a statue by Dunikowski titled &quot;The Soul Escaping the Body&quot;. It was on top of the ceremonial grave of Antoni Cierplikowski. The statue was known by many but was removed when the grave was cleared in 2004.

It is known as a small but well visited cemetery (Petit mais bien fréquenté).

<doc id="72573" wikidata="Q1370914" url="?curid=72573" title="Ted Taylor (physicist)">
<text>Theodore Brewster &quot;Ted&quot; Taylor (July 11, 1925 – October 28, 2004) was an American theoretical physicist, specifically concerning nuclear energy. His higher education included a PhD from Cornell University in theoretical physics. His most noteworthy contributions to the field of nuclear weaponry were his small bomb developments at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. Although not widely known to the general public, Taylor is credited with numerous landmarks in fission nuclear weaponry development, including having designed and developed the smallest, most powerful, and most efficient fission weapons ever tested by the U.S. program. His vision and creativity allowed him to thrive in the field. The later part of Taylor&#x27;s career was focused on nuclear energy instead of weaponry, and included his work on Project Orion, nuclear reactor developments, and anti-nuclear proliferation.

==Early life==
Ted Taylor was born in Mexico City, Mexico, on July 11, 1925. His mother and father were both Americans. His mother, Barbara Southworth Howland Taylor, held a PhD in Mexican literature from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, and his father, Walter Clyde Taylor, was the director of a YMCA in Mexico City. Before marrying in 1922, his father had been a widower with three sons and his mother a widow with a son of her own. Both of his maternal grandparents were Congregationalist missionaries in Guadalajara. Taylor grew up in a house without electricity in the Atlixo 13 neighborhood of Cuernavaca. His upbringing was quiet and religious, and his home filled with books, mainly atlases and geographies, which he would read by candlelight. This interest followed him into adulthood.

Taylor showed an early interest in chemistry, specifically pyrotechnics, when he received a chemistry set at the age of ten. This fascination was enhanced when a small and exclusive university in the area built a chemistry laboratory in his neighborhood, after which Taylor had access to items from local druggists that otherwise would not have been readily available, including corrosive and explosive chemicals, as well as nitric and sulfuric acids. These allowed him to conduct his own experiments. He also often read through the 1913 New International Encyclopedia, which contained extensive chemistry, for new concoctions to make. These included sleeping drugs, small explosives, guncotton, precipitates, and many more. His mother was extremely tolerant of his experimentation but prohibited any experiments that involved nitroglycerin.

Growing up, Taylor also showed an interest in billiards. In the afternoons after school he played billiards for almost ten hours a week. He would recall this early interest as his introduction to the mechanics of collisions, relating it to his later work in particle physics. The behavior of the interacting balls on the table and their elastic collisions within the confining framework of the reflector cushions helped him to conceptualize the difficult abstractions of cross sections, neutron scattering, and fission chain reactions.

As a child, he developed a passion for music, and would quietly sit for an hour and listen to his favorite songs in the mornings before school. Later, while completing his PhD at Cornell, he noted that while his theoretical physicist peers embraced the classical music piped into their rooms, their experimentalist counterparts would uniformly shut the system off.

Taylor attended the American School in Mexico City from elementary school through high school. A gifted student, he finished the fourth through sixth grades in one year. Being an accelerated student, Taylor found himself three years younger than his friends as he entered his teens. Taylor graduated early from high school in 1941 at the age of 15. Not yet meeting the age requirements for American universities, he then attended the Exeter Academy in New Hampshire for one year, where he took Modern Physics from Elbert P. Little. This developed his interest in physics, though he displayed poor academic performance in the course: Little gave Taylor a grade D on his final winter term examination. He quickly brushed this failure off, and soon confirmed that he wanted to be a physicist. Apart from education, he also developed an interest in throwing discus at Exeter. This interest continued into his college career, as he continued to throw discus at Caltech.

He enrolled at the California Institute of Technology in 1942 and then spent his second and third years in the Navy V-12 program. This accelerated his schooling and he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from Caltech in 1945 at age nineteen.

After graduation, he attended the midshipman school at Throgs Neck, in the Bronx, New York, for one year to fulfill his naval active duty requirement. He was discharged in mid-1946, by which time he had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant.

He then enrolled in a graduate program in theoretical physics at the University of California at Berkeley, while also working part-time at the Berkeley Radiation laboratory, mainly on the cyclotron and a beta-ray spectrograph. After failing an oral preliminary examination on mechanics and heat, and a second prelim in modern physics in 1949, Taylor was disqualified from the graduate program.

Taylor married Caro Arnim in 1948 and had five children in the following years: Clare Hastings, Katherine Robertson, Christopher Taylor, Robert Taylor, and Jeffrey Taylor. Arnim was majoring in Greek at Scripps College, a liberal arts university in Claremont, California, and Taylor would visit her whenever he could. Both Arnim and Taylor were very shy people, and unsure of what the future held. When they first met they both believed that Taylor would end up as a college professor in a sleepy town, and that Caro would be a librarian. After 44 years of marriage the couple divorced in 1992.

Taylor died on October 28, 2004, of coronary artery disease, at the age of 79.

==Early career==
Prior to Taylor&#x27;s work at Los Alamos, he had firmly declared himself an opponent of nuclear weapons. While at the midshipmen school, he received news of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by the United States. He immediately wrote a letter home discussing the perils of nuclear proliferation and his fears that it would lead to the end of mankind in the event of another war. He showed some optimism, however, as he felt with proper leadership the nuclear bomb could result in the end of wars altogether. Either way, he was still very curious about the field of nuclear physics after his time as an undergraduate.

Taylor began his work in nuclear physics in 1949 when he was hired to a junior position at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the Theoretical Physics Division. He received this job after failing out of the PhD program at Berkeley; J. Carson Mark connected Taylor with a leader at Los Alamos and recommended him for a position. Taylor was unsure of the details of his new job at Los Alamos prior to his arrival. He had only been briefed that his first assignment related to investigations of Neutron Diffusion Theory, a theoretical analysis of neutron movement within a nuclear core. While at Los Alamos, Taylor&#x27;s strictly anti-nuclear development beliefs changed. His theory on preventing nuclear war turned to developing bombs of unprecedented power in an attempt to make people, including governments, so afraid of the consequences of nuclear warfare that they would not dare engage in this sort of altercation. He continued in his junior position at Los Alamos until 1953, when he took a temporary leave of absence to obtain his PhD from Cornell.

Finishing his PhD in 1954, he returned to Los Alamos, and by 1956 he was famous for his work in small-bomb development. Freeman Dyson is quoted as saying, &quot;A great part of the small-bomb development of the last five years [at Los Alamos] was directly due to Ted.&quot; Although the majority of the brilliant minds at Los Alamos were focused on developing the fusion bomb, Taylor remained hard at work on improving fission bombs. His innovations in this area of study were so important that he was eventually given the freedom to choose whatever he wanted to study. Eventually, Taylor&#x27;s stance on nuclear warfare and weapon development changed, altering his career path. In 1956, Taylor left his position at Los Alamos and went to work for General Atomics. Here, he developed TRIGA, a reactor that produced isotopes used in the medical field. In 1958, Taylor began working on Project Orion, which sought to develop space travel that relied on nuclear energy as the fuel source. The proposed spacecraft would use a series of nuclear fission reactions as its propellant, thus accelerating space travel while eliminating the Earth&#x27;s source of fuel for nuclear weaponry. In collaboration with Dyson, Taylor led the project development team for six years until the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was instituted. After this, they could not test their developments and the project became unviable.

==Late career==
Theodore Taylor&#x27;s career shifted again after project Orion. He developed an even greater fear of the potential ramifications of his entire life&#x27;s work, and began taking precautionary measures to mitigate those concerns. In 1964 he served as the deputy director of the Defense Atomic Support Agency (a branch within the Department of Defense), where he managed the U.S. nuclear weapons inventory. Then, in 1966 he created a consulting firm called the International Research and Technology Corporation, located in Vienna, Austria, which sought to prevent the development of more nuclear weapons programs. Taylor also worked as a visiting professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz and Princeton University. His focus eventually turned to renewable energy, and In 1980 Taylor started a company called Nova Incorporated, which focused on nuclear energy alternatives as a means of supplementing the energy requirements of the earth. He studied energy capture from sources like cooling ice ponds and heating solar ponds, and eventually turned to energy conservation within buildings. Concerning this work in energy conservation, he founded a not-for-profit organization in Montgomery County, Maryland called Damascus Energy, which focuses on energy efficiency within the home. Theodore Taylor also served on the President of the United States&#x27; commission concerning the Three Mile Island Accident, working to mitigate the issues associated with the reactor meltdown.

==Legacy==
Theodore Taylor was involved in many important projects and made numerous contributions to nuclear development for the United States. During his time at Los Alamos, he was responsible for designing the smallest fission bomb of the era, named Davy Crockett, which weighed only , measured approximately across, and could produce between 10 and 20 tons of TNT equivalent. This device was formerly known as the M28 Weapons System. The Davy Crockett itself was the M388 Atomic Round fired from the weapons system, featuring a recoilless rifle either erected and fixed on as freestanding tripod or mounted on the frame of a light utility vehicle, such as the Jeep, the former functioned similarly to other modern rocket propelled rounds (see RPG-7). It was a mounted weapons system, which means that it would be set up, aimed, and fired as a crew-served weapon. Taylor also designed fission bombs smaller than Davy Crockett, which were developed after he left Los Alamos. He designed a nuclear bomb so small that it weighed only , but it was never developed and tested. Taylor designed the Super Oralloy Bomb, also known as the &quot;SOB&quot;. It still holds the record for the largest fission explosion ever tested (as the Ivy King device tested during Operation Ivy), producing over 500 kilotons of TNT equivalent. Taylor was credited with developing multiple techniques that improved the fission bomb. For example, he was largely responsible for the development of fusion boosting, which is a technique that improves the reaction yield and efficiency of a nuclear reaction. This technique was a re-invention of the implosion mechanism used in the bomb detonated at Nagasaki. He theorized a series of nuclear reactions within the implosion mechanism that, in combination, trigger the large chain reaction to detonate. This eliminated much of the energy waste and necessity for precision of the original reaction mechanism. This technique is still found in all U.S. fission nuclear weapons today. He also developed a technique that greatly reduced the size of atomic bombs. First tested in a bomb called &quot;Scorpion&quot;, it used a reflector made of beryllium, which was drastically lighter than the materials previously used, such as tungsten carbide (WC). Taylor recognized that although a low-atomic-number element like beryllium did not &quot;bounce&quot; neutrons back into the fissile core as efficiently as heavy tungsten, its propensity for neutron spallation (in nuclear physics the so-called &quot;(n,2n)&quot; reaction) more than compensated in overall reflector performance.

After these breakthroughs, Taylor became more of an important figure at Los Alamos. He was included in high priority situations reserved for important personnel, and was even taken to The Pentagon as a consultant on strategies and the potential outcomes of a nuclear war with Russia. In total, Taylor was responsible for the development of eight bombs: the Super Oralloy Bomb, Davey Crockett, Scorpion, Hamlet, Bee, Hornet, Viper, and the Puny Plutonium bomb. The latter was the first-ever dud in the history of U.S. nuclear tests. He produced the bomb called Hamlet after receiving direct orders from military officials to pursue a project in bomb efficiency; it ended up being the most efficient fission bomb ever exploded in the kiloton range.

Apart from bombs, Taylor also explored concepts of producing large amounts of nuclear fuel in an expedited manner. His plans, known as MICE (Megaton Ice Contained Explosions), essentially sought to plant a thermonuclear weapon deep in the ice and detonate it, resulting in a giant underground pool of radioactive materials that could then be retrieved. While his idea had merit, Taylor ultimately received little support for this concept and the project never came to fruition.

==Publications and other works==
Ted Taylor was an accomplished author in the latter part of his career. He worked in cooperation with many specialists in other fields to publish his work on anti-nuclear proliferation and sustainable nuclear energy. Perhaps the greatest fear that propelled Taylor to work so fervently in these areas was the realization that the consequences of nuclear material ending up in the wrong hands could be severe.

&quot;Nuclear Theft: Risks and Safeguards&quot; is a book Taylor wrote in collaboration with Mason Willrich in the 1970s. According to reviews, the book predicted a future where nuclear energy was the primary energy source in the United States, and therefore needed enhanced protective measures to protect the public. In the book, Taylor and Willrich provide multiple recommendations on ways to prevent nuclear material from ending up in the wrong hands, as they anticipated that there would be multiple more sources of nuclear byproducts and therefore more opportunity for nuclear theft. This book likely was a culmination of much of Ted&#x27;s work in the field, as he often toured nuclear reactor sites and provided insight on potential weak points in their security measures.

Taylor also co-authored the book &quot;The Restoration of the Earth&quot; with Charles C. Humpstone. According to reviews, the book focused on techniques to enhance sustainability and expanded on different sources of energy that could be used alternatively to meet the power needs of the earth. This book was also a culmination of his focus on nuclear security and the ramifications of the use of nuclear weaponry. In it he addressed the potential effects of nuclear fallout on the environment. This 1973 hardcover discussed potential sources of energy in 2000, along with the conceptualization of safer alternatives to the methods of acquiring nuclear energy that were available at the time. In fact, Taylor indirectly referenced a concept for a nuclear reactor which is inherently similar to a reactor that he patented in 1964. Taylor spent much of his time studying the risk potential of the nuclear power fuel cycle after learning about the detrimental effects that his nuclear weapons had on the environment, so he sought to explore new opportunities for safer use of nuclear power. In his writing, Taylor argued that the most dangerous and devastating events that could possibly occur during nuclear research would most likely happen at reactors that are incapable of running efficiently and maintaining a safe temperature. Taylor went on to state that the prioritization of safety in nuclear reactors is relatively low compared to how it should be, and that if one were to create a nuclear reactor with the capability of cooling down—without the initiation of a fission reaction—then efforts at harvesting nuclear energy would be more incentivized and exponentially safer.

Taylor also wrote the book &quot;Nuclear Proliferation: Motivations, Capabilities and Strategies for Control&quot; with Harold Feiveson and Ted Greenwood. The book explains the two most dangerous mechanisms by which nuclear proliferation could be devastating for the world, as well as how to disincentivize nuclear proliferation within destabilizing political systems.

Taylor further collaborated with George Gamow on a study called, &quot;What the World Needs Is a Good Two-Kiloton Bomb&quot;, which investigated the concept of small nuclear artillery weapons. This paper reflected another shift in Taylor&#x27;s beliefs about nuclear weapons. He had changed from his deterrent position to a position that sought to develop small yield nuclear weapons that could target specific areas and minimize collateral damage.

Taylor was not only involved in the publication of the aforementioned books, but he, along with a few of his colleagues, was also responsible for a number of patents involving nuclear physics. Taylor is credited with patenting a nuclear reactor with a prompt negative temperature coefficient and fuel element, along with a patent protecting their discovery of an efficient method of producing isotopes from thermonuclear explosions. The patent concerning the production of isotopes from thermonuclear explosions was groundbreaking because of its efficiency and cost effectiveness. It also provides a means for attaining necessary elements that otherwise are difficult to find in nature. Prior to this discovery, the cost per neutron in a nuclear reaction was relatively high. The patent concerning the prompt negative temperature coefficient was groundbreaking because it provided a markedly safer reactor even in the event of misuse. With the negative temperature coefficient, the reactor can mitigate sudden surges of reactivity propelled into the system. These patented realizations would later become vital components in the future of nuclear technology.

&quot;The Curve of Binding Energy&quot;, by John McPhee, is written primarily about the life of Theodore Taylor, as he and McPhee traveled together quite often—spending a great deal of time with one another. It is evident that during their time together, McPhee was very inclined to learn from Taylor. Many of Taylor&#x27;s personal opinions regarding nuclear energy and safety are mentioned throughout McPhee&#x27;s writing. McPhee voices one of Taylor&#x27;s bigger concerns in particular—that plutonium can be devastating if left in the wrong hands. According to McPhee, Taylor suspected that if plutonium were to be acquired by someone with ill-intentions and handled improperly, the aftermath could be catastrophic—as plutonium is a rather volatile element and can be lethal for anyone within hundreds of miles. This clearly can be avoided, Taylor suggests, if nuclear reactors are protected and all sources of nuclear fuel elements are heavily guarded. The book would inspire Princeton student John Aristotle Phillips, and several other imitators, to prove Taylor&#x27;s contention that &quot;anyone&quot; could design a plausible nuclear weapon using declassified and public information.

==The Santa Claus machine and Pugwash==
According to Freitas and Merkle, the only known extant source on Taylor&#x27;s concept of the &quot;Santa Claus machine&quot; is found in Nigel Calder&#x27;s &quot;Spaceships of the Mind&quot;. The concept would use a large mass spectrometer to separate an ion beam into atomic elements for later use in making products.

Taylor was a member of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs and attended several of its meetings during the 1980s. After his retirement he lived in Wellsville, New York.

==Freeman Dyson on Taylor==
Freeman Dyson said of Taylor, &quot;Very few people have Ted&#x27;s imagination. ... I think he is perhaps the greatest man that I ever knew well. And he is completely unknown.&quot;

<text>In astronomy, axial precession is a gravity-induced, slow, and continuous change in the orientation of an astronomical body&#x27;s rotational axis. In the absence of precession, the astronomical body&#x27;s orbit would show axial parallelism. In particular, axial precession can refer to the gradual shift in the orientation of Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation in a cycle of approximately 26,000 years. This is similar to the precession of a spinning top, with the axis tracing out a pair of cones joined at their apices. The term &quot;precession&quot; typically refers only to this largest part of the motion; other changes in the alignment of Earth&#x27;s axis—nutation and polar motion—are much smaller in magnitude.

Earth&#x27;s precession was historically called the precession of the equinoxes, because the equinoxes moved westward along the ecliptic relative to the fixed stars, opposite to the yearly motion of the Sun along the ecliptic. Historically, 
the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes is usually attributed in the West to the 2nd-century-BC astronomer Hipparchus. With improvements in the ability to calculate the gravitational force between planets during the first half of the nineteenth century, it was recognized that the ecliptic itself moved slightly, which was named planetary precession, as early as 1863, while the dominant component was named lunisolar precession. Their combination was named general precession, instead of precession of the equinoxes.

Lunisolar precession is caused by the gravitational forces of the Moon and Sun on Earth&#x27;s equatorial bulge, causing Earth&#x27;s axis to move with respect to inertial space. Planetary precession (an advance) is due to the small angle between the gravitational force of the other planets on Earth and its orbital plane (the ecliptic), causing the plane of the ecliptic to shift slightly relative to inertial space. Lunisolar precession is about 500 times greater than planetary precession. In addition to the Moon and Sun, the other planets also cause a small movement of Earth&#x27;s axis in inertial space, making the contrast in the terms lunisolar versus planetary misleading, so in 2006 the International Astronomical Union recommended that the dominant component be renamed the precession of the equator, and the minor component be renamed precession of the ecliptic, but their combination is still named general precession. Many references to the old terms exist in publications predating the change.

==Nomenclature==

The term &quot;Precession&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;&quot; (&quot;to precede, to come before or earlier&quot;). The stars viewed from Earth are seen to proceed from east to west daily (at about 15 degrees per hour), due to the Earth&#x27;s diurnal motion, and yearly (at about 1 degree per day), due to the Earth&#x27;s revolution around the Sun. At the same time the stars can be observed to anticipate slightly such motion, at the rate of approximately 50 arc seconds per year (1 degree per 72 years), a phenomenon known as the &quot;precession of the equinoxes&quot;.

In describing this motion astronomers generally have shortened the term to simply &quot;precession&quot;. In describing the &quot;cause&quot; of the motion physicists have also used the term &quot;precession&quot;, which has led to some confusion between the observable phenomenon and its cause, which matters because in astronomy, some precessions are real and others are apparent. This issue is further obfuscated by the fact that many astronomers are physicists or astrophysicists.

The term &quot;precession&quot; used in astronomy generally describes the observable precession of the equinox (the stars moving retrograde across the sky), whereas the term &quot;precession&quot; as used in physics, generally describes a mechanical process.

==Effects==

The precession of the Earth&#x27;s axis has a number of observable effects. First, the positions of the south and north celestial poles appear to move in circles against the space-fixed backdrop of stars, completing one circuit in approximately 26,000 years. Thus, while today the star Polaris lies approximately at the north celestial pole, this will change over time, and other stars will become the &quot;north star&quot;. In approximately 3,200 years, the star Gamma Cephei in the Cepheus constellation will succeed Polaris for this position. The south celestial pole currently lacks a bright star to mark its position, but over time precession also will cause bright stars to become South Stars. As the celestial poles shift, there is a corresponding gradual shift in the apparent orientation of the whole star field, as viewed from a particular position on Earth.

Secondly, the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun at the solstices, equinoxes, or other time defined relative to the seasons, slowly changes. For example, suppose that the Earth&#x27;s orbital position is marked at the summer solstice, when the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt is pointing directly toward the Sun. One full orbit later, when the Sun has returned to the same apparent position relative to the background stars, the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt is not now directly toward the Sun: because of the effects of precession, it is a little way &quot;beyond&quot; this. In other words, the solstice occurred a little &quot;earlier&quot; in the orbit. Thus, the tropical year, measuring the cycle of seasons (for example, the time from solstice to solstice, or equinox to equinox), is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year, which is measured by the Sun&#x27;s apparent position relative to the stars. After about 26 000 years the difference amounts to a full year, so the positions of the seasons relative to the orbit are &quot;back where they started&quot;. (Other effects also slowly change the shape and orientation of the Earth&#x27;s orbit, and these, in combination with precession, create various cycles of differing periods; see also Milankovitch cycles. The magnitude of the Earth&#x27;s tilt, as opposed to merely its orientation, also changes slowly over time, but this effect is not attributed directly to precession.)

For identical reasons, the apparent position of the Sun relative to the backdrop of the stars at some seasonally fixed time slowly regresses a full 360° through all twelve traditional constellations of the zodiac, at the rate of about 50.3 seconds of arc per year, or 1 degree every 71.6 years.

At present, the rate of precession corresponds to a period of 25,772 years, so tropical year is shorter than sidereal year by 1,224.5 seconds 

The rate itself varies somewhat with time (see Values below), so one cannot say that in exactly 25,772 years the Earth&#x27;s axis will be back to where it is now.

For further details, see Changing pole stars and Polar shift and equinoxes shift, below.

==History==
===Hellenistic world===
====Hipparchus====
The discovery of precession usually is attributed to Hipparchus (190–120 BC) of Rhodes or Nicaea, a Greek astronomer. According to Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, Hipparchus measured the longitude of Spica and other bright stars. Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, Timocharis (320–260 BC) and Aristillus (~280 BC), he concluded that Spica had moved 2° relative to the autumnal equinox. He also compared the lengths of the tropical year (the time it takes the Sun to return to an equinox) and the sidereal year (the time it takes the Sun to return to a fixed star), and found a slight discrepancy. Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving (&quot;precessing&quot;) through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century, in other words, completing a full cycle in no more than 36,000 years.

Virtually all of the writings of Hipparchus are lost, including his work on precession. They are mentioned by Ptolemy, who explains precession as the rotation of the celestial sphere around a motionless Earth. It is reasonable to presume that Hipparchus, similarly to Ptolemy, thought of precession in geocentric terms as a motion of the heavens, rather than of the Earth.

====Ptolemy====
The first astronomer known to have continued Hipparchus&#x27;s work on precession is Ptolemy in the second century AD. Ptolemy measured the longitudes of Regulus, Spica, and other bright stars with a variation of Hipparchus&#x27;s lunar method that did not require eclipses. Before sunset, he measured the longitudinal arc separating the Moon from the Sun. Then, after sunset, he measured the arc from the Moon to the star. He used Hipparchus&#x27;s model to calculate the Sun&#x27;s longitude, and made corrections for the Moon&#x27;s motion and its parallax. Ptolemy compared his own observations with those made by Hipparchus, Menelaus of Alexandria, Timocharis, and Agrippa. He found that between Hipparchus&#x27;s time and his own (about 265 years), the stars had moved 2°40&#x27;, or 1° in 100 years (36&quot; per year; the rate accepted today is about 50&quot; per year or 1° in 72 years). It is possible, however, that Ptolemy simply trusted Hipparchus&#x27; figure instead of making his own measurements. He also confirmed that precession affected all fixed stars, not just those near the ecliptic, and his cycle had the same period of 36,000 years as that of Hipparchus.

====Other authors====
Most ancient authors did not mention precession and, perhaps, did not know of it. For instance, Proclus rejected precession, while Theon of Alexandria, a commentator on Ptolemy in the fourth century, accepted Ptolemy&#x27;s explanation. Theon also reports an alternate theory:

:&quot;According to certain opinions ancient astrologers believe that from a certain epoch the solstitial signs have a motion of 8° in the order of the signs, after which they go back the same amount. ...&quot; (Dreyer 1958, p. 204)

Instead of proceeding through the entire sequence of the zodiac, the equinoxes &quot;trepidated&quot; back and forth over an arc of 8°. The theory of trepidation is presented by Theon as an alternative to precession.

===Alternative discovery theories===
====Babylonians====
Various assertions have been made that other cultures discovered precession independently of Hipparchus. According to Al-Battani, the Chaldean astronomers had distinguished the tropical and sidereal year so that by approximately 330 BC, they would have been in a position to describe precession, if inaccurately, but such claims generally are regarded as unsupported.

====Maya====
Archaeologist Susan Milbrath has speculated that the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar of &quot;30,000 years involving the Pleiades...may have been an effort to calculate the precession of the equinox.&quot; This view is held by few other professional scholars of Maya civilization.

====Ancient Egyptians====
Similarly, it is claimed the precession of the equinoxes was known in Ancient Egypt, prior to the time of Hipparchus (the Ptolemaic period). These claims remain controversial. Ancient Egyptians kept accurate calendars and recorded dates on temple walls, so it would be a simple matter for them to plot the &quot;rough&quot; precession rate. 

The Dendera Zodiac, a star-map inside the Hathor temple at Dendera, allegedly records the precession of the equinoxes. In any case, if the ancient Egyptians knew of precession, their knowledge is not recorded as such in any of their surviving astronomical texts.

Michael Rice, a popular writer on Ancient Egypt, has written that Ancient Egyptians must have observed the precession, and suggested that this awareness had profound affects on their culture. Rice noted that Egyptians re-oriented temples in response to precession of associated stars.

===India===
Before 1200, India had two theories of trepidation, one with a rate and another without a rate, and several related models of precession. Each had minor changes or corrections by various commentators. The dominant of the three was the trepidation described by the most respected Indian astronomical treatise, the &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; (3:9–12), composed but revised during the next few centuries. It used a sidereal epoch, or ayanamsa, that is still used by all Indian calendars, varying over the ecliptic longitude of 19°11′ to 23°51′, depending on the group consulted. This epoch causes the roughly 30 Indian calendar years to begin 23–28 days after the modern March equinox. The March equinox of the &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; librated 27° in both directions from the sidereal epoch. Thus the equinox moved 54° in one direction and then back 54° in the other direction. This cycle took 7200 years to complete at a rate of 54″/year. The equinox coincided with the epoch at the beginning of the &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; in −3101 and again 3,600 years later in 499. The direction changed from prograde to retrograde midway between these years at −1301 when it reached its maximum deviation of 27°, and would have remained retrograde, the same direction as modern precession, for 3600 years until 2299.

Another trepidation was described by Varāhamihira (). His trepidation consisted of an arc of 46°40′ in one direction and a return to the starting point. Half of this arc, 23°20′, was identified with the Sun&#x27;s maximum declination on either side of the equator at the solstices. But no period was specified, thus no annual rate can be ascertained.

Several authors have described precession to be near 200,000revolutions in a Kalpa of 4,320,000,000years, which would be a rate of = 60″/year. They probably deviated from an even 200,000revolutions to make the accumulated precession zero near 500. Visnucandra () mentions 189,411revolutions in a Kalpa or 56.8″/year. Bhaskara I () mentions [1]94,110revolutions in a Kalpa or 58.2″/year. Bhāskara II () mentions 199,699revolutions in a Kalpa or 59.9″/year.

===Chinese astronomy===
Yu Xi (fourth century AD) was the first Chinese astronomer to mention precession. He estimated the rate of precession as 1° in 50 years.

===Middle Ages and Renaissance===
In medieval Islamic astronomy, precession was known based on Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, and by observations that refined the value.

Al-Battani, in his work &quot;Zij Al-Sabi&quot;, mentions Hipparchus&#x27;s calculation of precession, and Ptolemy&#x27;s value of 1 degree per 100 solar years, says that he measured precession and found it to be one degree per 66 solar years.

Subsequently, Al-Sufi, in his &quot;Book of Fixed Stars&quot;, mentions the same values that Ptolemy&#x27;s value for precession is 1 degree per 100 solar years. He then quotes a different value from &quot;Zij Al Mumtahan&quot;, which was done during Al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s reign, of 1 degree for every 66 solar years. He also quotes the aforementioned &quot;Zij Al-Sabi&quot; of Al-Battani as adjusting coordinates for stars by 11 degrees and 10 minutes of arc to account for the difference between Al-Battani&#x27;s time and Ptolemy&#x27;s.

Later, the &quot;Zij-i Ilkhani&quot;, compiled at the Maragheh observatory, sets the precession of the equinoxes at 51 arc seconds per annum, which is very close to the modern value of 50.2 arc seconds.

In the Middle Ages, Islamic and Latin Christian astronomers treated &quot;trepidation&quot; as a motion of the fixed stars to be &quot;added to&quot; precession. This theory is commonly attributed to the Arab astronomer Thabit ibn Qurra, but the attribution has been contested in modern times. Nicolaus Copernicus published a different account of trepidation in &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (1543). This work makes the first definite reference to precession as the result of a motion of the Earth&#x27;s axis. Copernicus characterized precession as the third motion of the Earth.

===Modern period===
Over a century later, Isaac Newton in &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (1687) explained precession as a consequence of gravitation. However, Newton&#x27;s original precession equations did not work, and were revised considerably by Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert and subsequent scientists.

==Hipparchus&#x27;s discovery==
Hipparchus gave an account of his discovery in &quot;On the Displacement of the Solsticial and Equinoctial Points&quot; (described in &quot;Almagest&quot; III.1 and VII.2). He measured the ecliptic longitude of the star Spica during lunar eclipses and found that it was about 6° west of the autumnal equinox. By comparing his own measurements with those of Timocharis of Alexandria (a contemporary of Euclid, who worked with Aristillus early in the 3rd century BC), he found that Spica&#x27;s longitude had decreased by about 2° in the meantime (exact years are not mentioned in &quot;Almagest&quot;). Also in VII.2, Ptolemy gives more precise observations of two stars, including Spica, and concludes that in each case a 2° 40&#x27; change occurred between 128 BC and AD 139. Hence, 1° per century or one full cycle in 36,000 years, that is, the precessional period of Hipparchus as reported by Ptolemy; cf. page 328 in Toomer&#x27;s translation of Almagest, 1998 edition. He also noticed this motion in other stars. He speculated that only the stars near the zodiac shifted over time. Ptolemy called this his &quot;first hypothesis&quot; (&quot;Almagest&quot; VII.1), but did not report any later hypothesis Hipparchus might have devised. Hipparchus apparently limited his speculations, because he had only a few older observations, which were not very reliable.

Because the equinoctial points are not marked in the sky, Hipparchus needed the Moon as a reference point; he used a lunar eclipse to measure the position of a star. Hipparchus already had developed a way to calculate the longitude of the Sun at any moment. A lunar eclipse happens during Full moon, when the Moon is at opposition, precisely 180° from the Sun. Hipparchus is thought to have measured the longitudinal arc separating Spica from the Moon. To this value, he added the calculated longitude of the Sun, plus 180° for the longitude of the Moon. He did the same procedure with Timocharis&#x27; data. Observations such as these eclipses, incidentally, are the main source of data about when Hipparchus worked, since other biographical information about him is minimal. The lunar eclipses he observed, for instance, took place on 21 April 146 BC, and 21 March 135 BC.

Hipparchus also studied precession in &quot;On the Length of the Year&quot;. Two kinds of year are relevant to understanding his work. The tropical year is the length of time that the Sun, as viewed from the Earth, takes to return to the same position along the ecliptic (its path among the stars on the celestial sphere). The sidereal year is the length of time that the Sun takes to return to the same position with respect to the stars of the celestial sphere. Precession causes the stars to change their longitude slightly each year, so the sidereal year is longer than the tropical year. Using observations of the equinoxes and solstices, Hipparchus found that the length of the tropical year was 365+1/4−1/300 days, or 365.24667 days (Evans 1998, p. 209). Comparing this with the length of the sidereal year, he calculated that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century. From this information, it is possible to calculate that his value for the sidereal year was 365+1/4+1/144 days. By giving a minimum rate, he may have been allowing for errors in observation.

To approximate his tropical year, Hipparchus created his own lunisolar calendar by modifying those of Meton and Callippus in &quot;On Intercalary Months and Days&quot; (now lost), as described by Ptolemy in the &quot;Almagest&quot; III.1. The Babylonian calendar used a cycle of 235 lunar months in 19 years since 499 BC (with only three exceptions before 380 BC), but it did not use a specified number of days. The Metonic cycle (432 BC) assigned 6,940 days to these 19 years producing an average year of 365+1/4+1/76 or 365.26316 days. The Callippic cycle (330 BC) dropped one day from four Metonic cycles (76 years) for an average year of 365+1/4 or 365.25 days. Hipparchus dropped one more day from four Callippic cycles (304 years), creating the Hipparchic cycle with an average year of 365+1/4−1/304 or 365.24671 days, which was close to his tropical year of 365+1/4−1/300 or 365.24667 days.

Hipparchus&#x27;s mathematical signatures are found in the Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient astronomical computer of the second century BC. The mechanism is based on a solar year, the Metonic Cycle, which is the period the Moon reappears in the same place in the sky with the same phase (full Moon appears at the same position in the sky approximately in 19 years), the Callipic cycle (which is four Metonic cycles and more accurate), the Saros cycle, and the Exeligmos cycles (three Saros cycles for the accurate eclipse prediction). Study of the Antikythera Mechanism showed that the ancients used very accurate calendars based on all the aspects of solar and lunar motion in the sky. In fact, the Lunar Mechanism which is part of the Antikythera Mechanism depicts the motion of the Moon and its phase, for a given time, using a train of four gears with a pin and slot device which gives a variable lunar velocity that is very close to Kepler&#x27;s second law. That is, it takes into account the fast motion of the Moon at perigee and slower motion at apogee.

==Changing pole stars==

A consequence of the precession is a changing pole star. Currently Polaris is extremely well suited to mark the position of the north celestial pole, as Polaris is a moderately bright star with a visual magnitude of 2.1 (variable), and is located about one degree from the pole, with no stars of similar brightness too close.
The previous pole star was Kochab (Beta Ursae Minoris, β UMi, β Ursae Minoris), the brightest star in the bowl of the &quot;Little Dipper&quot;, located 16 degrees from Polaris. It held that role from 1500 BC to AD 500. It was not quite as accurate in its day as Polaris is today. Today, Kochab and its neighbor Pherkad are referred to as the &quot;Guardians of the Pole&quot; (meaning Polaris).

On the other hand, Thuban in the constellation Draco, which was the pole star in 3000 BC, is much less conspicuous at magnitude 3.67 (one-fifth as bright as Polaris); today it is invisible in light-polluted urban skies.

When Polaris becomes the north star again around 27,800, it will then be farther away from the pole than it is now due to its proper motion, while in 23,600 BC it came closer to the pole.

It is more difficult to find the south celestial pole in the sky at this moment, as that area is a particularly bland portion of the sky. The nominal south pole star is Sigma Octantis, which with magnitude 5.5 is barely visible to the naked eye even under ideal conditions. That will change from the 80th to the 90th centuries, however, when the south celestial pole travels through the False Cross.

This situation also is seen on a star map. The orientation of the south pole is moving toward the Southern Cross constellation. For the last 2,000 years or so, the Southern Cross has pointed to the south celestial pole. As a consequence, the constellation is difficult to view from subtropical northern latitudes, unlike in the time of the ancient Greeks. The Southern Cross can be viewed from as far north as Miami (about 25° N), but only during the winter/early spring.

==Polar shift and equinoxes shift==

The images at right attempt to explain the relation between the precession of the Earth&#x27;s axis and the shift in the equinoxes. These images show the position of the Earth&#x27;s axis on the &quot;celestial sphere&quot;, a fictitious sphere which places the stars according to their position as seen from Earth, regardless of their actual distance. The first image shows the celestial sphere from the outside, with the constellations in mirror image. The second image shows the perspective of a near-Earth position as seen through a very wide angle lens (from which the apparent distortion arises).

The rotation axis of the Earth describes, over a period of 25,700 years, a small among the stars near the top of the diagram, centered on the ecliptic north pole (the ) and with an angular radius of about 23.4°, an angle known as the &quot;obliquity of the ecliptic&quot;. The direction of precession is opposite to the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis. The was the Earth&#x27;s rotation axis 5,000 years ago, when it pointed to the star Thuban. The yellow axis, pointing to Polaris, marks the axis now.

The equinoxes occur where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic (red line), that is, where the Earth&#x27;s axis is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the Sun and Earth.The term &quot;equinox&quot; here refers to a point on the celestial sphere so defined, rather than the moment in time when the Sun is overhead at the Equator (though the two meanings are related). When the axis &quot;precesses&quot; from one orientation to another, the equatorial plane of the Earth (indicated by the circular grid around the equator) moves. The celestial equator is just the Earth&#x27;s equator projected onto the celestial sphere, so it moves as the Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane moves, and the intersection with the ecliptic moves with it. The positions of the poles and equator &quot;on Earth&quot; do not change, only the orientation of the Earth against the fixed stars.

As seen from the , 5,000 years ago, the March equinox was close to the star Aldebaran in Taurus. Now, as seen from the yellow grid, it has shifted (indicated by the ) to somewhere in the constellation of Pisces.

Still pictures like these are only first approximations, as they do not take into account the variable speed of the precession, the variable obliquity of the ecliptic, the planetary precession (which is a slow rotation of the ecliptic plane itself, presently around an axis located on the plane, with longitude 174.8764°) and the proper motions of the stars.

The precessional eras of each constellation, often known as &quot;Great Months&quot;, are given, approximately, in the table below:

==Cause==
The precession of the equinoxes is caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and the Moon, and to a lesser extent other bodies, on the Earth. It was first explained by Isaac Newton.

Axial precession is similar to the precession of a spinning top. In both cases, the applied force is due to gravity. For a spinning top, this force tends to be almost parallel to the rotation axis initially and increases as the top slows down. For a gyroscope on a stand it can approach 90 degrees. For the Earth, however, the applied forces of the Sun and the Moon are closer to perpendicular to the axis of rotation.

The Earth is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid, with an equatorial diameter about 43 kilometers larger than its polar diameter. Because of the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt, during most of the year the half of this bulge that is closest to the Sun is off-center, either to the north or to the south, and the far half is off-center on the opposite side. The gravitational pull on the closer half is stronger, since gravity decreases with the square of distance, so this creates a small torque on the Earth as the Sun pulls harder on one side of the Earth than the other. The axis of this torque is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the Earth&#x27;s rotation so the axis of rotation precesses. If the Earth were a perfect sphere, there would be no precession.

This average torque is perpendicular to the direction in which the rotation axis is tilted away from the ecliptic pole, so that it does not change the axial tilt itself. The magnitude of the torque from the Sun (or the Moon) varies with the angle between the Earth&#x27;s spin axis direction and that of the gravitational attraction. It approaches zero when they are perpendicular. For example, this happens at the equinoxes in the case of the interaction with the Sun. This can be seen to be since the near and far points are aligned with the gravitational attraction, so there is no torque due to the difference in gravitational attraction.

Although the above explanation involved the Sun, the same explanation holds true for any object moving around the Earth, along or close to the ecliptic, notably, the Moon. The combined action of the Sun and the Moon is called the lunisolar precession. In addition to the steady progressive motion (resulting in a full circle in about 25,700 years) the Sun and Moon also cause small periodic variations, due to their changing positions. These oscillations, in both precessional speed and axial tilt, are known as the nutation. The most important term has a period of 18.6 years and an amplitude of 9.2 arcseconds.

In addition to lunisolar precession, the actions of the other planets of the Solar System cause the whole ecliptic to rotate slowly around an axis which has an ecliptic longitude of about 174° measured on the instantaneous ecliptic. This so-called planetary precession shift amounts to a rotation of the ecliptic plane of 0.47 seconds of arc per year (more than a hundred times smaller than lunisolar precession). The sum of the two precessions is known as the general precession.

==Equations==
The tidal force on Earth due to a perturbing body (Sun, Moon or planet) is expressed by Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, whereby the gravitational force of the perturbing body on the side of Earth nearest is said to be greater than the gravitational force on the far side by an amount proportional to the difference in the cubes of the distances between the near and far sides. If the gravitational force of the perturbing body acting on the mass of the Earth as a point mass at the center of Earth (which provides the centripetal force causing the orbital motion) is subtracted from the gravitational force of the perturbing body everywhere on the surface of Earth, what remains may be regarded as the tidal force. This gives the paradoxical notion of a force acting away from the satellite but in reality it is simply a lesser force toward that body due to the gradient in the gravitational field. For precession, this tidal force can be grouped into two forces which only act on the equatorial bulge outside of a mean spherical radius. This couple can be decomposed into two pairs of components, one pair parallel to Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane toward and away from the perturbing body which cancel each other out, and another pair parallel to Earth&#x27;s rotational axis, both toward the ecliptic plane. The latter pair of forces creates the following torque vector on Earth&#x27;s equatorial bulge:

:formula_1

where

:&quot;GM&quot;, standard gravitational parameter of the perturbing body
:&quot;r&quot;, geocentric distance to the perturbing body
:&quot;C&quot;, moment of inertia around Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation
:&quot;A&quot;, moment of inertia around any equatorial diameter of Earth
:&quot;C&quot; − &quot;A&quot;, moment of inertia of Earth&#x27;s equatorial bulge (&quot;C&quot; &gt; &quot;A&quot;)
:&quot;δ&quot;, declination of the perturbing body (north or south of equator)
:&quot;α&quot;, right ascension of the perturbing body (east from March equinox).

The three unit vectors of the torque at the center of the Earth (top to bottom) are x on a line within the ecliptic plane (the intersection of Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane with the ecliptic plane) directed toward the March equinox, y on a line in the ecliptic plane directed toward the summer solstice (90° east of x), and z on a line directed toward the north pole of the ecliptic.

The value of the three sinusoidal terms in the direction of x for the Sun is a sine squared waveform varying from zero at the equinoxes (0°, 180°) to 0.36495 at the solstices (90°, 270°). The value in the direction of y for the Sun is a sine wave varying from zero at the four equinoxes and solstices to ±0.19364 (slightly more than half of the sine squared peak) halfway between each equinox and solstice with peaks slightly skewed toward the equinoxes (43.37°(−), 136.63°(+), 223.37°(−), 316.63°(+)). Both solar waveforms have about the same peak-to-peak amplitude and the same period, half of a revolution or half of a year. The value in the direction of z is zero.

The average torque of the sine wave in the direction of y is zero for the Sun or Moon, so this component of the torque does not affect precession. The average torque of the sine squared waveform in the direction of x for the Sun or Moon is:

:formula_2

where

:formula_3, semimajor axis of Earth&#x27;s (Sun&#x27;s) orbit or Moon&#x27;s orbit
:&quot;e&quot;, eccentricity of Earth&#x27;s (Sun&#x27;s) orbit or Moon&#x27;s orbit

and 1/2 accounts for the average of the sine squared waveform, formula_4 accounts for the average distance cubed of the Sun or Moon from Earth over the entire elliptical orbit, and ε (the angle between the equatorial plane and the ecliptic plane) is the maximum value of &quot;δ&quot; for the Sun and the average maximum value for the Moon over an entire 18.6 year cycle.

Precession is:

:formula_5

where &quot;ω&quot; is Earth&#x27;s angular velocity and &quot;Cω&quot; is Earth&#x27;s angular momentum. Thus the first order component of precession due to the Sun is:

:formula_6

whereas that due to the Moon is:

:formula_7

where &quot;i&quot; is the angle between the plane of the Moon&#x27;s orbit and the ecliptic plane. In these two equations, the Sun&#x27;s parameters are within square brackets labeled S, the Moon&#x27;s parameters are within square brackets labeled L, and the Earth&#x27;s parameters are within square brackets labeled E. The term formula_8 accounts for the inclination of the Moon&#x27;s orbit relative to the ecliptic. The term is Earth&#x27;s dynamical ellipticity or flattening, which is adjusted to the observed precession because Earth&#x27;s internal structure is not known with sufficient detail. If Earth were homogeneous the term would equal its third eccentricity squared,

:formula_9

where a is the equatorial radius () and c is the polar radius (), so .

Applicable parameters for J2000.0 rounded to seven significant digits (excluding leading 1) are:
which yield
:&quot;dψS/dt&quot; = 2.450183 /s
:&quot;dψL/dt&quot; = 5.334529 /s

both of which must be converted to ″/a (arcseconds/annum) by the number of arcseconds in 2π radians (1.296″/2π) and the number of seconds in one annum (a Julian year) (3.15576s/a):
:&quot;dψS/dt&quot; = 15.948788″/a   vs   15.948870″/a from Williams
:&quot;dψL/dt&quot; = 34.723638″/a   vs   34.457698″/a from Williams.

The solar equation is a good representation of precession due to the Sun because Earth&#x27;s orbit is close to an ellipse, being only slightly perturbed by the other planets. The lunar equation is not as good a representation of precession due to the Moon because the Moon&#x27;s orbit is greatly distorted by the Sun and neither the radius nor the eccentricity is constant over the year.

==Values==
Simon Newcomb&#x27;s calculation at the end of the 19th century for general precession (&quot;p&quot;) in longitude gave a value of 5,025.64 arcseconds per tropical century, and was the generally accepted value until artificial satellites delivered more accurate observations and electronic computers allowed more elaborate models to be calculated. Jay Henry Lieske developed an updated theory in 1976, where &quot;p&quot; equals 5,029.0966 arcseconds (or 1.3969713 degrees) per Julian century. Modern techniques such as VLBI and LLR allowed further refinements, and the International Astronomical Union adopted a new constant value in 2000, and new computation methods and polynomial expressions in 2003 and 2006; the accumulated precession is:

:&quot;pA&quot; = 5,028.796195&quot;T&quot; + 1.1054348&quot;T&quot;2 + higher order terms, in arcseconds, with &quot;T&quot;, the time in Julian centuries (that is, 36,525 days) since the epoch of 2000.

The rate of precession is the derivative of that:

:&quot;p&quot; = 5,028.796195 + 2.2108696&quot;T&quot; + higher order terms.

The constant term of this speed (5,028.796195 arcseconds per century in above equation) corresponds to one full precession circle in 25,771.57534 years (one full circle of 360 degrees divided by 50.28796195 arcseconds per year) although some other sources put the value at 25771.4 years, leaving a small uncertainty.

The precession rate is not a constant, but is (at the moment) slowly increasing over time, as indicated by the linear (and higher order) terms in &quot;T&quot;. In any case it must be stressed that this formula is only valid over a &quot;limited time period&quot;. It is a polynomial expression centred on the J2000 datum, empirically fitted to observational data, not on a deterministic model of the Solar System. It is clear that if &quot;T&quot; gets large enough (far in the future or far in the past), the &quot;T&quot;² term will dominate and &quot;p&quot; will go to very large values. In reality, more elaborate calculations on the numerical model of the Solar System show that the precessional rate has a period of about 41,000 years, the same as the obliquity of the ecliptic. That is,
:&quot;p&quot; = &quot;A&quot; + &quot;BT&quot; + &quot;CT&quot;2 + …
is an approximation of
:&quot;p&quot; = &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; sin (2π&quot;T&quot;/&quot;P&quot;), where &quot;P&quot; is the 41,000-year period.

Theoretical models may calculate the constants (coefficients) corresponding to the higher powers of &quot;T&quot;, but since it is impossible for a polynomial to match a periodic function over all numbers, the difference in all such approximations will grow without bound as &quot;T&quot; increases. Sufficient accuracy can be obtained over a limited time span by fitting a high enough order polynomial to observation data, rather than a necessarily imperfect dynamic numerical model. For present flight trajectory calculations of artificial satellites and spacecraft, the polynomial method gives better accuracy. In that respect, the International Astronomical Union has chosen the best-developed available theory. For up to a few centuries into the past and future, none of the formulas used diverge very much. For up to a few thousand years in the past and the future, most agree to some accuracy. For eras farther out, discrepancies become too large – the exact rate and period of precession may not be computed using these polynomials even for a single whole precession period.

The precession of Earth&#x27;s axis is a very slow effect, but at the level of accuracy at which astronomers work, it does need to be taken into account on a daily basis. Although the precession and the tilt of Earth&#x27;s axis (the obliquity of the ecliptic) are calculated from the same theory and are thus related one to the other, the two movements act independently of each other, moving in opposite directions.

Precession rate exhibits a secular decrease due to tidal dissipation from 59&quot;/a to 45&quot;/a (a = annum = Julian year) during the 500 million year period centered on the present. After short-term fluctuations (tens of thousands of years) are averaged out, the long-term trend can be approximated by the following polynomials for negative and positive time from the present in &quot;/a, where &quot;T&quot; is in billions of Julian years (Ga):
:&quot;p&quot; = 50.475838 − 26.368583&quot;T&quot; + 21.890862&quot;T&quot;2
:&quot;p&quot; = 50.475838 − 27.000654&quot;T&quot; + 15.603265&quot;T&quot;2

This gives an average cycle length now of 25,676 years.

Precession will be greater than &quot;p&quot; by the small amount of +0.135052&quot;/a between and . The jump to this excess over &quot;p&quot; will occur in only beginning now because the secular decrease in precession is beginning to cross a resonance in Earth&#x27;s orbit caused by the other planets.

According to W. R. Ward, in about 1,500 million years, when the distance of the Moon, which is continuously increasing from tidal effects, has increased from the current 60.3 to approximately 66.5 Earth radii, resonances from planetary effects will push precession to 49,000 years at first, and then, when the Moon reaches 68 Earth radii in about 2,000 million years, to 69,000 years. This will be associated with wild swings in the obliquity of the ecliptic as well. Ward, however, used the abnormally large modern value for tidal dissipation. Using the 620-million year average provided by tidal rhythmites of about half the modern value, these resonances will not be reached until about 3,000 and 4,000 million years, respectively. However, due to the gradually increasing luminosity of the Sun, the oceans of the Earth will have vaporized before that time (about 2,100 million years from now).

<text>Joab (; Hebrew &quot;Yōʼav&quot;, &quot;Yōʼāḇ&quot;) the son of Zeruiah, was the nephew of King David and the commander of his army, according to the Hebrew Bible.

== Name ==
The name Joab is, like many other Hebrew names, theophoric—derived from YHVH (), the name of the God of Israel, and the Hebrew word &#x27;av&#x27; (), meaning &#x27;father&#x27;. It therefore means &#x27;YHVH [is] father&#x27;.

== Life ==
Joab was the son of Zeruiah, a sister of king David (1 Chronicles 2:15–16). According to Josephus (&quot;Antiquities&quot; VII, 1, 3) his father was called Suri.

Joab had two brothers, Abishai and Asahel. Asahel was killed by Abner in combat, for which Joab took revenge by murdering Abner against David&#x27;s wishes and shortly after David and Abner had secured peace between the House of David and the House of Saul (2 Samuel 2:13–3:21; 3:27).

While 2 Samuel 3:27 explicitly states that Joab killed Abner &quot;to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel&quot;, Josephus (Antiquities VII, 1, 3) paints a different picture: Joab had forgiven Abner for the death of Joab&#x27;s brother Asahel, since Abner had slain Asahel honorably in combat, but killed Abner as a potential threat to his rank after Abner had switched to the side of David and granted David control over the tribe of Benjamin.

After Joab led the assault on the fortress of Mount Zion, David made him captain of his army (2 Samuel 8:16; 20:23; 1 Chronicles 11:4–6; 18:15; 27:34). He led the army against Aram, Ammon, Moab and Edom. He also colluded with David in the murder of Uriah (2 Samuel 11:14–25).

Joab played a pivotal role as the commander of David&#x27;s forces during Absalom&#x27;s rebellion. Absalom, one of David&#x27;s sons, rallied much of Israel in rebellion against David, who was forced to flee with only his most trusted men. However, David could not bring himself to harm his son, and ordered that none of his men should kill Absalom during the ensuing battle. However, when a man reported that Absalom had been found alive and caught in a tree, Joab and his men killed him (2 Samuel 18:1–33).

Hearing of David&#x27;s grief over the reported death of Absalom, Joab confronted and admonished David. The king followed Joab&#x27;s advice to make a public appearance to encourage his troops (2 Samuel 19:1–8).

David later replaced him as commander of the army with David&#x27;s nephew, Amasa (2 Samuel 19:13). Joab later killed Amasa (2 Samuel 20:8–13; 1 Kings 2:5).

Joab and other commanders began questioning David&#x27;s judgment (2 Samuel 24:2–4). As David neared the end of his reign, Joab offered his allegiance to David&#x27;s eldest living son, Adonijah, rather than to the eventual king, Solomon (1 Kings 1:1–27).

On the brink of death, David told Solomon to have Joab killed, citing Joab&#x27;s past betrayals and the blood that he was guilty of. Solomon ordered Joab&#x27;s death by the hand of Benaiah (1 Kings 2:29–34). Hearing this, Joab fled to the Tent of the Tabernacle (where Adonijah had previously sought successful refuge according to 1 Kings 1:50–53) and told Benaiah that he would die there. Benaiah killed Joab there and thereby replaced him as commander of the army. Joab was buried in &#x27;the wilderness&#x27; (1 Kings 2:34).

==Commentary==
The &quot;ATS Bible Dictionary&quot; describes Joab as &quot;a valiant warrior, and an able general; and his great influence on public affairs was often exerted for good, as in the rebellion of Absalom, and the numbering of Israel ... [b]ut as a man he was imperious, revengeful, and unscrupulous&quot;.

<text>Arminius (; 18/17 BC–AD 21) was a chieftain of the Germanic Cherusci tribe who is best known for commanding an alliance of Germanic tribes at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in AD 9, in which three Roman legions under the command of general and governor Publius Quinctilius Varus were destroyed. His victory at Teutoburg Forest precipitated the Roman Empire&#x27;s permanent strategic withdrawal and the deprovincialization of Germania Magna, and modern historians regard it as one of Imperial Rome&#x27;s greatest defeats. As it prevented the Romanization of Germanic peoples east of the Rhine, it has also been considered one of the most decisive battles in history and a turning point in human history.

Born a prince of the Cherusci tribe, Arminius was part of the Roman-friendly faction of the tribe. He learned Latin and served in the Roman military, which gained him Roman citizenship, and the rank of &quot;eques&quot;. After serving with distinction in the Great Illyrian Revolt, he was sent to Germania to aid the local governor Publius Quinctilius Varus in completing the Roman conquest of the Germanic tribes. While in this capacity, Arminius secretly plotted a Germanic revolt against Roman rule, which culminated in the ambush and destruction of three Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest.

In the aftermath of the battle, Arminius fought retaliatory invasions by the Roman general Germanicus in the battles of Pontes Longi, Idistaviso, and the Angrivarian Wall, and defeated a rival, the Marcomanni king Maroboduus. Arminius sought to become a king and was killed by his relatives in 21. He was remembered in Germanic legends for generations afterwards. The Roman historian Tacitus designated Arminius as the liberator of the Germanic tribes and commended him for having fought the Roman Empire to a standstill at the peak of its power.

During the unification of Germany in the 19th century, Arminius was hailed by German nationalists as a symbol of German unity and freedom. Following World War II, however, Arminius&#x27; significance diminished in Germany due to the rise of anti-militarism, pacifism, and anti-nationalism; the 2,000th anniversary of his victory at the Teutoburg Forest was only lightly commemorated in Germany.

==Name==
The etymology of the Latin name is unknown, and confusion is further created by recent scholars who alternately referred to him as . In his &quot;History&quot;, Marcus Velleius Paterculus calls him &quot;Arminius, the son of Sigimer, a prince of the nation&quot; and states he &quot;attained the dignity of equestrian rank&quot;. Due to Roman naming conventions of the time, it is likely is an adopted name granted to him upon citizenship or in any case not his Germanic name. The name instead appears to ultimately be of Etruscan origin, appearing as and on inscriptions found at Volaterrae. According to another theory, that name was given to Arminius for his service in Armenia.

The German translation of as the name &quot;Hermann&quot; dates from the 16th century, possibly first by Martin Luther. In German, Arminius was traditionally distinguished as (&quot;Hermann the Cheruscan&quot;) or (&quot;Hermann the Cheruscan Prince&quot;). Hermann etymologically means &quot;Man of War&quot;, coming from the Old High German meaning &quot;war&quot; and meaning &quot;man&quot;. This has also led to his English nickname &quot;Herman the German.&quot;

Born in 18 or 17 BC in Germania, Arminius was the son of the Cheruscan chief Segimerus (German: &quot;Segimer&quot;; Proto-Germanic: &quot;Sigimariz&quot;; Old English: &quot;Sigemær&quot;), who was allied with Rome.

Arminius learned to speak Latin and joined the Roman military with his younger brother Flavus. He served in the Roman army between AD 1 and 6, and received a military education as well as Roman citizenship and the status of equite before returning to Germania. These experiences gave him knowledge of Roman politics and military tactics, which allowed him to successfully anticipate enemy battle maneuvers during his later campaigns against the Roman army.

==Return to Germania==

Around the year AD 4, Arminius assumed command of a Cheruscan detachment of Roman auxiliary forces, probably while fighting in the Pannonian wars on the Balkan peninsula. He returned to northern Germania in AD 7 or 8, where the Roman Empire had established secure control of the territories just east of the Rhine, along the Lippe and Main rivers, and was now seeking to extend its hegemony eastward to the Weser and Elbe rivers, under Publius Quinctilius Varus, a high-ranking administrative official appointed by Augustus as governor. Arminius began plotting to unite various Germanic tribes in order to thwart Roman efforts to incorporate their lands into the empire. This proved a difficult task, as the tribes were strongly independent and many were traditionally enemies of each other.

Between AD 6 and 9, the Romans were forced to move eight of the eleven legions present in Germania east of the Rhine to crush a rebellion in the Balkans, leaving Varus with only three legions to face the Germans, which was still 18,000 troops, or 6,000 men per legion. An additional two legions, under the command of Lucius Nonius Asprenas, were stationed in Moguntiacum. Arminius saw this as the perfect opportunity to defeat Varus.

==Anti-Roman uprising==
In the autumn of AD 9, the 25-year-old Arminius brought to Varus a false report of rebellion in northern Germany. He persuaded Varus to divert the three legions under his command (composed of the 17th, 18th, and 19th legions, plus three cavalry detachments and six cohorts of auxiliaries), which were at the time marching to winter quarters, to suppress the rebellion. Varus and his legions marched right into the trap that Arminius had set for them near Kalkriese. Arminius&#x27; tribe, the Cherusci, and their allies the Marsi, Chatti, Bructeri, Chauci, and Sicambri (five out of at least fifty Germanic tribes at the time) ambushed and annihilated Varus&#x27; entire army, totaling over 20,000 men, as it marched along a narrow road through a dense forest. Recent archaeological finds show the long-debated location of the three-day battle was almost certainly near Kalkriese Hill, about north of present-day Osnabrück. When defeat was certain, Varus committed suicide by falling upon his sword. The battle was one of the most devastating defeats Rome suffered in its history. Arminius&#x27; success in destroying three entire legions and driving the Romans out of Germany marked a high point of Germanic power for centuries. Roman attempts to reconquer Germania failed, although they did eventually manage to break Arminius&#x27; carefully coordinated alliance.
After the battle, the Germans quickly annihilated every trace of Roman presence east of the Rhine. Roman settlements such as the Waldgirmes Forum were abandoned. The vastly outnumbered Roman garrison of Aliso (present-day Haltern am See), under the command of the prefect Lucius Cedicius, inflicted heavy losses on the Germans before retreating into Gaul, resisting long enough for Lucius Nonius Asprenas to organize the Roman defense on the Rhine and Tiberius to arrive with a new army. This prevented Arminius from crossing the Rhine and invading Gaul.

== Marriage ==
At some point after the battle, Arminius married a Germanic princess named Thusnelda. Her father was the Cheruscan prince Segestes, who was pro-Roman. But Arminius abducted and then impregnated Thusnelda circa AD 14. This elopement was likely a result of a dispute between Arminius and Segestes who was against their relationship. In May of 15 the Roman general Germanicus captured Thusnelda. At the point of her capture she was pregnant and living with her father, who had taken her back. Arminius deeply grieved the capture of Thusnelda and did not marry again. Tacitus recorded that Arminius was &quot;driven to frenzy&quot; by the loss of his beloved wife. Tacitus states in the &quot;Annals&quot;:Arminius, with his naturally furious temper, was driven to frenzy by the seizure of his wife and the foredooming to slavery of his wife&#x27;s unborn child. He flew hither and thither among the Cherusci, demanding &quot;war against Segestes, war against Cæsar.&quot; And he refrained not from taunts.Thusnelda gave birth to a son named Thumelicus who grew up in Roman captivity. Tacitus describes him as having an unusual story, which he promises to tell in his later writings, but these writings have never been found.

==Roman retribution and death==
Between 14 and 16, Germanicus led punitive operations into Germany, fighting Arminius to a draw in the Battle at Pontes Longi and twice defeating him (according to Tacitus): first in the Battle of Idistaviso and later at the Battle of the Angrivarian Wall. In 15, Roman troops managed to recapture one of the three legionary eagles lost in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. In 16, a second eagle was retrieved. Tiberius denied the request of Germanicus to launch an additional campaign for 17, however, having decided the frontier with Germania would stand at the Rhine river. Instead, he offered Germanicus the honor of a triumph for his two victories. The third Roman eagle was recovered in 41 by Publius Gabinius, under the emperor Claudius. Arminius also faced opposition from his father-in-law and other pro-Roman Germanic leaders. His brother Flavus, who had been raised alongside him in Rome, remained loyal to the Roman Empire and fought under Germanicus against Arminius at the Battle of Idistaviso. With the end of the Roman threat, a war broke out between Arminius and Marbod, king of the Marcomanni. It ended with Marbod fleeing to Ravenna and Roman protection, but Arminius failed to break into the &quot;natural fortification&quot; of Bohemia, and the war ended in stalemate. In 19, Germanicus died in Antioch under circumstances which led many to believe he had been poisoned by his opponents. Arminius died two years later in 21, murdered by opponents within his own tribe who felt that he was becoming too powerful. Tiberius allegedly had refused an earlier offer from a Chatti nobleman to poison Arminius: &quot;It was not by secret treachery but openly and by arms that the people of Rome avenged themselves on their enemies.&quot;

==Legacy and influence==
Arminius&#x27; victory against the Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest had a far-reaching effect on the subsequent history of both the ancient Germanic peoples and on the Roman Empire. The Romans made no further concerted efforts to conquer and permanently hold Germania beyond the Rhine and the &quot;Agri Decumates&quot;. Numerous modern historians have regarded Arminius&#x27; victory as one of the most decisive battles in history, with some calling it &quot;Rome&#x27;s greatest defeat&quot;.

===Roman imperial expansion===

In the accounts of his Roman enemies, Arminius is highly regarded for his military leadership and as a defender of the liberty of his people. Based on these records, the story of Arminius was revived in the 16th century with the recovery of the histories of Tacitus, who wrote in his &quot;Annales II, 88&quot;:

Arminius was not the only reason for Rome&#x27;s change of policy towards Germania. Politics also played a factor; emperors found they could rarely trust a large army to a potential rival, though Augustus had enough loyal family members to wage his wars. Also, Augustus, in his 40-year reign, had annexed many territories still at the beginning of the process of Romanization. Tiberius, who succeeded Augustus in AD 14, decided that Germania was a far less developed land, possessing few villages and only a small food surplus, and therefore was not currently important to Rome. Conquering Germania would require a commitment too burdensome for the imperial finances and an excessive expenditure of military force.

Modern scholars have pointed out that the Rhine was a more practical boundary for the Roman Empire than any other river in Germania. Armies on the Rhine could be supplied from the Mediterranean Sea via the Rhône, Saône, and Mosel, with only a brief area of portage. Armies on the Elbe, however, would have to have been supplied by extensive overland routes or by ships travelling the hazardous Atlantic. Economically, the Rhine already had towns and sizable villages at the time of the Gallic conquest. The Rhine was significantly more accessible from Rome and better equipped to supply sizable garrisons than the regions beyond.

Rome chose no longer to rule directly in Germania east of the Rhine and north of the Danube, instead preferring to exert indirect influence through the tactics of using divide and rule and the appointing of client kings, which were cheaper than military campaigns. Italicus, nephew of Arminius, was appointed king of the Cherusci; Vangio and Sido became vassal princes of the powerful Suebi, etc. Only when indirect methods proved insufficient to control the Germanic tribes beyond the Rhine, did Roman emperors occasionally lead devastating punitive campaigns deep into Germania. One of them, led by the Roman emperor Maximinus Thrax, resulted in a Roman victory in 235 at the Battle at the Harzhorn Hill, located in the modern German state of Lower Saxony, east of the Weser river, between the towns of Kalefeld and Bad Gandersheim.

===Germanic sagas===
In the early 19th century, attempts were made to show that the story of Arminius and his victory may have lived on in the Old Norse sagas, in the form of the dragon slayer Sigurd of the Völsunga saga and the Nibelungenlied. An Icelandic account states that Sigurd &quot;slew the dragon&quot; in the Gnitaheidr—today the suburb Knetterheide of the city of Bad Salzuflen, located at a strategic site on the Werre river which could very well have been the point of departure of Varus&#x27; legions on their way to their doom in the Teutoburg Forest. One of the foremost Scandinavian scholars of the 19th century, Guðbrandur Vigfússon, identified Sigurd as Arminius. This educated guess was also picked up by Otto Höfler, who was a prominent Nazi academic during World War II.

===German nationalism===
After Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Annals&quot; were rediscovered by Renaissance humanists and first published during the Gutenberg Revolution of the 15th century, Arminius became an important symbol of German national identity, as a figure who successfully opposed colonialism and prevented the Romanization of his people by outgeneraling and defeating one of the world&#x27;s first superpowers. Indeed, learning of his victory over the Roman army was especially important to German Renaissance humanists, as the Renaissance only reached the Holy Roman Empire much later than southern Europe and German humanists were widely looked down upon by their Italian colleagues. The first literary adaptation of the Arminius story came in 1520 with Ulrich von Hutten&#x27;s Latin dialogue &quot;Arminius&quot;, which inserts the Germanic leader into a reimagining of the twelfth chapter of Lucian&#x27;s satirical &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;; a debate between Alexander the Great, Hannibal, and Scipio Africanus before the underworld judgment seat of Minos over who most deserves the position of history&#x27;s greatest general and military strategist. Arminius argues his own claim and calls upon Tacitus to bear witness, and ultimately wins the case and the eloquent praise of Minos.

This version influenced later adaptations of the story, and reflected a wide interest in Arminius during the years of the German Reformation; the name &quot;Arminius&quot; was interpreted as reflecting the name &quot;Hermann&quot; by Martin Luther, who saw Arminius as a symbol of his religious followers among the German people and their resistance to the Papacy and the Roman Catholic Church. 

During the military occupation of the German States, first by the French Revolutionary Army and then by the French Imperial Army of Napoleon Bonaparte, &quot;Hermann der Cheruskerfürst&quot; once again became a national icon and a martyr within both German Romanticism and the anti-Colonialist romantic nationalism fueled by the Napoleonic Wars, which are still termed in Germany the Wars of Liberation. This may particularly be seen as in Caspar David Friedrich&#x27;s 1812 painting &quot;The Tombs of the Old Heroes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein/Käppel&quot;&gt;Dorothea Klein (ed.), Lutz Käppel (ed.): &quot;Das diskursive Erbe Europas: Antike und Antikerezeption&quot;. Peter Lang, 2008, , p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; During the unification of Germany in the 19th century, Arminius was hailed as a symbol of German unity and liberation. 
In 1808, Heinrich von Kleist wrote the play &quot;Die Hermannsschlacht&quot;, but with Napoleon&#x27;s victory at Wagram it remained in manuscript, being published in 1821 and not staged until 1860. The play has been revived repeatedly at moments of national crisis and was especially used as propaganda in Nazi Germany.

In 1838, construction was started on a massive statue of Arminius, known as the &quot;Hermannsdenkmal&quot;, on a hill near Detmold in the Teutoburg Forest; it was finally completed and dedicated during the early years of the Second German Empire in the wake of the German victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. The monument has been a major tourist attraction ever since, as has the Hermann Heights Monument, a similar statue erected in New Ulm, Minnesota, in the United States in 1897. The Hermann Heights monument was erected by the Sons of Hermann, a fraternal organization formed in New York City by German Americans as a means of self protection against anti-German sentiment and discrimination in 1840; and that flourished during the 19th century in American cities and rural areas with large populations speaking the German language in the United States. Hermann, Missouri, a town on the Missouri River founded in the 1830s and incorporated in 1845, was also named for Arminius.

Following the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, Arminius became lesser-known among West Germans and the educational system shied away from teaching about his life due to a sense of guilt and shame, rooted in both the Holocaust and Nazi war crimes, related to any form of German nationalism. There was, however, a radically different practice in East Germany. Particularly during the Cold War, Arminius and his warriors were anachronistically reinterpreted quite similarly to the slave revolt led by Spartacus in the Marxist-Leninist official history promoted by the State; as an early socialist revolution and as revolutionary terror against the &quot;Roman slaveholder society&quot; (&quot;Sklavenhaltergesellschaft&quot;). The legacy of Arminius and his followers was further reinterpreted as symbolic of the allegedly &quot;peace-loving&quot; Warsaw Pact countries, while Imperial Rome was made into a symbol of the capitalist and allegedly Fascistic United States and the NATO military alliance, which were cast as the new evil empire needing to be resisted.

According to journalist David Crossland: &quot;The old nationalism has been replaced by an easy-going patriotism that mainly manifests itself at sporting events like the soccer World Cup.&quot; The German Bundesliga football club DSC Arminia Bielefeld is named after Arminius. In the German diaspora, on the other hand, the 2,000-year anniversary of the battle was celebrated in New Ulm, Minnesota, proudly and without restraint. There were mock battles between Romans and club-wielding barbarians and also a lecture series in an auditorium.

<text>Environmental geology, like hydrogeology, is an applied science concerned with the practical application of the principles of geology in the solving of environmental problems created by man. It is a multidisciplinary field that is closely related to engineering geology and, to a lesser extent, to environmental geography. Each of these fields involves the study of the interaction of humans with the geologic environment, including the biosphere, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, and to some extent the atmosphere. In other words, environmental geology is the application of geological information to solve conflicts, minimizing possible adverse environmental degradation, or maximizing possible advantageous conditions resulting from the use of natural and modified environment. With an increasing world population and industrialization, the natural environment and resources are under high strain which puts them at the forefront of world issues. Environmental geology is on the rise with these issues as solutions are found by utilizing it.

== Environmental geology in relation to other fields ==

=== Hydrogeology ===
Hydrogeology is the area of geology that deals with the distribution and movement of groundwater in the soil and rocks of the Earth&#x27;s crust. Environmental geology is applied in this field as environmental problems are created in groundwater pollution due to mining, agriculture, and other human activities. Pollution is the impairment of groundwater by heat, bacteria, or chemicals. The greatest contributors to groundwater pollution are surface sources such as fertilizers, leaking sewers, polluted streams, and mining/mineral wastes. Environmental geology approaches the groundwater pollution problem by creating objectives when monitoring.

These objectives include:

* determining the nature, extent, and degree of contamination,
* determining the propagation mechanism and hydrological parameters, so that the appropriate countermeasures can be taken,
* detecting and warning of movement into critical areas,
* assessing the effectiveness of the immediate countermeasures undertaken to offset the effects of contamination,
* recording of data for long term evaluation and compliance with standards, and 
* initiating research monitoring to validate and verify the models and assumptions upon which the immediate countermeasures are based.

=== Soil Science ===
Soil science is the study of soil as a natural resource on the surface of the Earth. Environmental geology is applied in this field as soil scientists raise concerns on soil preservation and arable land with the world increasing population, increasing per capita food consumption, and land degradation. These environmental problems are attacked and reduced with environmental geology by using soil surveys. These surveys assess the properties of soils and are of use in geologic mapping, rural and urban land planning, especially in terms of agriculture and forestry. Soil surveys are essential parts of land use planning and mapping as they provide insight on agricultural land usage. Soil surveys provide information on optimum cropping systems and soil management so less land degradation is done and agriculture provides its optimum yield for the increasing per capita food consumption.

Soil survey investigations include:

* soil erodibility,
* depth of soil, 
* steepness of slope,
* shrink-swell potential,
* frequency of rock outcrops,
* possibility of salinization
* fertilizer-plant response, and 
* crop variety trials.

== Focuses ==
Environmental geology includes

* managing geological and hydrogeological resources such as fossil fuels, minerals, water (surface and groundwater), and land use,
* studying the earth&#x27;s surface through the disciplines of geomorphology, and edaphology,
* defining and mitigating exposure of natural hazards on humans,
* managing industrial and domestic waste disposal and minimizing or eliminating effects of pollution, and
* performing associated activities, often involving litigation.

Environmental geology is often applied to some well known environmental issues including population growth, mining, diminishing resources, and global land use.

=== Mining ===
Since the Stone Age, when humans began mining for flint, they have been dependent on this practice, and the dependency on minerals continues to increase as society evolves. One of the downsides of mining is that it is restricted to areas where minerals are present and economically viable. Mining duration is also restrained as mineral resources are finite, so when a deposit is exhausted, mining in that location comes to an end. Although modern mining and mineral activities utilize many ways to reduce negative environmental impacts, accidental releases can occur and the appropriate mitigation and prevention practices were not common in historical practices. Potentially harmful metals, other deposit constituents, and mineral processing chemicals or byproducts can contaminate the surrounding environment due to these situations. Some common environmental impacts of mining are rock displacements that allow fine dust particles to seep into surface waters, the defacement of the local landscape, and the large amounts of waste with some being chemically reactive. Ultimately, the impact that mining has on the environment is determined by many factors such as the size of the operation and the type of mining. Environmental geology has reduced the negative environmental impacts of mining as it has been used in litigation toward mining. In some countries like Brazil and Australia for example, it is decreed by law that sites must undergo rehabilitation after a mining operation has ceased. Prior to any mining, an assessment is also necessary to analyze the potential environmental impacts. Another measure taken is that an environmental management program must be produced to show how the mine will operate. Land planning is an important aspect in deciding whether a site is suitable for mining but some environmental degradation is inevitable. Environmental Geology continues to lower the amount of negative effects that mining has on the natural environment.

=== Recycling ===
Nonrenewable resources are only one type of resource with the other two being potentially renewable and perpetual. Nonrenewable resources, such as fossil fuels and metals, are finite, and therefore cannot be replenished during human lifetime, but are being depleted at a high rate. Due to their importance in many economies, this creates an issue as the world keeps developing the technologies used to exploit these resources. Some important roles of these nonrenewable resources are to heat homes, fuel cars, and build infrastructure. Environmental geology has been used to approach this issue with the sustainable development of recycling and reusing. Recycling is the process of collecting recyclable consumer and industrial materials and products and then sorting them so they can be processed into raw materials with the intention of then using the raw materials to create new products. Recycling and reusing can be done on an individual scale as well as an industrial scale. These practices maximize the usage of resources as much as possible all while minimizing waste. They also manage the industrial and domestic waste disposal as they reduce the amount of waste discharged into the global environment.

Reusing and recycling include:

* composting: the biological decomposition of organic garden and food waste in order to use it as soil conditioner,
* upcycling: increasing the value and quality in materials and products through the recycling process,
* freecycling: giving or getting free items from others before buying new ones
* industrial ecology: dismantling of massive artifacts to become input for new processes

Environmental geology&#x27;s approach to the decline of nonrenewable resources along with high amounts of waste polluting the Earth has been to reduce wasteful usage and recycle when possible.

=== Land use ===

Planning out the usage of land is important to reduce the risk of natural hazards on humans and their infrastructure, but mostly to reduce negative human impact on the natural environment. The land, water, air, materials, and energy use are all critically impacted by human settlement and resource production. New sites must be found for mining, waste disposal, and industrial sites as these are all parts of an industrial society. Suitable sites are often difficult to find and get approval for as they must be shown to have barriers so contaminants are prevented from entering the environment.

Site investigation in land use planning often includes at least two phases, an orientating investigation and a detailed investigation. The information in an orientating investigation is obtained through maps and other archived data. The information in a detailed investigation is obtained through a reconnaissance survey in the field and by reviewing the historic land use.

The orientating investigation includes:

* topography, land use and vegetation, settlements, roads and railways,
* climate: precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration, direction and the velocity of the wind, as well as the frequency of strong winds,
* hydrological and hydrogeological conditions: streams, lakes and ponds, springs, wells, use and quality of surface and groundwater, runoff, water balance, aquifer/aquiclude properties and stratigraphy, groundwater table, groundwater recharge and discharge,
* geology: soil, geological structures, stratigraphy and lithology,
* ecological aspects: e.g., nature reserves, protected geotopes, water protection areas.

The detailed investigation includes:

* geology: thickness and lateral extent of strata and geological units, lithology, homogeneity and heterogeneity, bedding conditions and tectonic structures, fractures, impact of weathering, 
* groundwater: water table, water content, direction and rate of groundwater flow, hydraulic conductivity, value of aquifer, 
* geochemical site characterization: chemical composition of soil, rocks and groundwater, estimation of contamination retention, 
* geotechnical stability: The geological barrier must be capable of adsorbing strain from the weight of a landfill, slag heap, or industrial building.
* geogenic events: active faults, karst, earthquakes, subsidence, landslides, 
* anthropogenic activities: mining damage, buildings, quarries, gravel pits, etc., and 
* changes in soil and groundwater quality

Environmental geology includes both the monitorization and planning of land use. Land use maps are made to represent current land use along with possible future uses. Land maps like the one shown can be used to reduce human settlement in areas with potential natural hazards such as floods, geological instability, wildfires, etc. In the land map shown it can be seen that there is a margin of trees and vegetation between the settlements and Mississippi River to reduce the risk of flood damage as the Mississippi Rivers water levels change.

<text>Weathering is the deterioration of rocks, soils and minerals (as well as wood and artificial materials) through contact with water, atmospheric gases, sunlight, and biological organisms. It occurs &quot;in situ&quot; (on-site, with little or no movement), and so is distinct from erosion, which involves the transport of rocks and minerals by agents such as water, ice, snow, wind, waves and gravity.

Weathering processes are either physical or chemical. The former involves the breakdown of rocks and soils through such mechanical effects as heat, water, ice and wind. The latter covers reactions to water, atmospheric gases and biologically produced chemicals with rocks and soils. Water is the principal agent behind both kinds, though atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide and the activities of biological organisms are also important. Biological chemical weathering is also called biological weathering.

The materials left after the rock breaks down combine with organic material to create soil. Many of Earth&#x27;s landforms and landscapes are the result of weathering, erosion and redeposition. Weathering is a crucial part of the rock cycle; sedimentary rock, the product of weathered rock, covers 66% of the Earth&#x27;s continents and much of the ocean floor.

==Physical==
Physical weathering, also called mechanical weathering or &quot;disaggregation&quot;, is the class of processes that causes the disintegration of rocks without chemical change. Physical weathering involves the breakdown of rocks into smaller fragments through processes such as expansion and contraction, mainly due to temperature changes. Two types of physical breakdown are freeze-thaw weathering and thermal fracturing. Pressure release can also cause weathering without temperature change. It is usually much less important than chemical weathering, but can be significant in subarctic or alpine environments. Furthermore, chemical and physical weathering often go hand in hand. For example, cracks extended by physical weathering will increase the surface area exposed to chemical action, thus amplifying the rate of disintegration.

Frost weathering is the most important form of physical weathering. Next in importance is wedging by plant roots, which sometimes enter cracks in rocks and pry them apart. The burrowing of worms or other animals may also help disintegrate rock, as can &quot;plucking&quot; by lichens.

===Frost===

&quot;Frost weathering&quot; is the collective name for those forms of physical weathering that are caused by the formation of ice within rock outcrops. It was long believed that the most important of these is &quot;frost wedging&quot;, which is the widening of cracks or joints in rocks resulting from the expansion of porewater when it freezes. A growing body of theoretical and experimental work suggests that ice segregation, whereby supercooled water migrates to lenses of ice forming within the rock, is the more important mechanism.

When water freezes, its volume increases by 9.2%. This expansion can theoretically generate pressures greater than , though a more realistic upper limit is . This is still much greater than the tensile strength of granite, which is about . This makes frost wedging, in which pore water freezes and its volumetric expansion fractures the enclosing rock, appear to be a plausible mechanism for frost weathering. Ice will simply expand out of a straight open fracture before it can generate significant pressure. Thus, frost wedging can only take place in small tortuous fractures. The rock must also be almost completely saturated with water, or the ice will simply expand into the air spaces in the unsaturated rock without generating much pressure. These conditions are unusual enough that frost wedging is unlikely to be the dominant process of frost weathering. Frost wedging is most effective where there are daily cycles of melting and freezing of water-saturated rock, so it is unlikely to be significant in the tropics, in polar regions or in arid climates.

Ice segregation is a less well characterized mechanism of physical weathering. It takes place because ice grains always have a surface layer, often just a few molecules thick, that resembles liquid water more than solid ice, even at temperatures well below the freezing point. This &quot;premelted liquid layer&quot; has unusual properties, including a strong tendency to draw in water by capillary action from warmer parts of the rock. This results in growth of the ice grain that puts considerable pressure on the surrounding rock, up to ten times greater than is likely with frost wedging. This mechanism is most effective in rock whose temperature averages just below the freezing point, . Ice segregation results in growth of ice needles and ice lenses within fractures in the rock and parallel to the rock surface, which gradually pry the rock apart.

===Thermal stress===
&quot;Thermal stress weathering&quot; results from the expansion and contraction of rock due to temperature changes. Thermal stress weathering is most effective when the heated portion of the rock is buttressed by surrounding rock, so that it is free to expand in only one direction.

Thermal stress weathering comprises two main types, thermal shock and thermal fatigue. Thermal shock takes place when the stresses are so great that the rock cracks immediately, but this is uncommon. More typical is thermal fatigue, in which the stresses are not great enough to cause immediate rock failure, but repeated cycles of stress and release gradually weaken the rocks. Block disintegration, when rock joints weaken from temperature fluctuations and the rock splits into rectangular blocks, can be attributed to thermal fatigue.
Thermal stress weathering is an important mechanism in deserts, where there is a large diurnal temperature range, hot in the day and cold at night. As a result, thermal stress weathering is sometimes called insolation weathering, but this is misleading. Thermal stress weathering can be caused by any large change of temperature, and not just intense solar heating. It is likely as important in cold climates as in hot, arid climates. Wildfires can also be a significant cause of rapid thermal stress weathering.

The importance of thermal stress weathering has long been discounted by geologists, based on experiments in the early 20th century that seemed to show that its effects were unimportant. These experiments have since been criticized as unrealistic, since the rock samples were small, were polished (which reduces nucleation of fractures), and were not buttressed. These small samples were thus able to expand freely in all directions when heated in experimental ovens, which failed to produce the kinds of stress likely in natural settings. The experiments were also more sensitive to thermal shock than thermal fatigue, but thermal fatigue is likely the more important mechanism in nature. Geomorphologists have begun to reemphasize the importance of thermal stress weathering, particularly in cold climates.

===Pressure release===

&quot;Pressure release&quot; or &quot;unloading&quot; is a form of physical weathering seen when deeply buried rock is exhumed. Intrusive igneous rocks, such as granite, are formed deep beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface. They are under tremendous pressure because of the overlying rock material. When erosion removes the overlying rock material, these intrusive rocks are exposed and the pressure on them is released. The outer parts of the rocks then tend to expand. The expansion sets up stresses which cause fractures parallel to the rock surface to form. Over time, sheets of rock break away from the exposed rocks along the fractures, a process known as exfoliation. Exfoliation due to pressure release is also known as &quot;sheeting&quot;.

As with thermal weathering, pressure release is most effective in buttressed rock. Here the differential stress directed toward the unbuttressed surface can be as high as , easily enough to shatter rock. This mechanism is also responsible for spalling in mines and quarries, and for the formation of joints in rock outcrops.

Retreat of an overlying glacier can also lead to exfoliation due to pressure release. This can be enhanced by other physical wearing mechanisms.

===Salt-crystal growth ===


&quot;Salt crystallization&quot; (also known as salt weathering, salt wedging or haloclasty) causes disintegration of rocks when saline solutions seep into cracks and joints in the rocks and evaporate, leaving salt crystals behind. As with ice segregation, the surfaces of the salt grains draw in additional dissolved salts through capillary action, causing the growth of salt lenses that exert high pressure on the surrounding rock. Sodium and magnesium salts are the most effective at producing salt weathering. Salt weathering can also take place when pyrite in sedimentary rock is chemically weathered to iron(II) sulfate and gypsum, which then crystallize as salt lenses.

Salt crystallization can take place wherever salts are concentrated by evaporation. It is thus most common in arid climates where strong heating causes strong evaporation and along coasts. Salt weathering is likely important in the formation of tafoni, a class of cavernous rock weathering structures.

===Biomechanical relationship===

Living organisms may contribute to mechanical weathering, as well as chemical weathering (see § Biological weathering below). Lichens and mosses grow on essentially bare rock surfaces and create a more humid chemical microenvironment. The attachment of these organisms to the rock surface enhances physical as well as chemical breakdown of the surface microlayer of the rock. Lichens have been observed to pry mineral grains loose from bare shale with their hyphae (rootlike attachment structures), a process described as &quot;plucking&quot;, and to pull the fragments into their body, where the fragments then undergo a process of chemical weathering not unlike digestion. On a larger scale, seedlings sprouting in a crevice and plant roots exert physical pressure as well as providing a pathway for water and chemical infiltration.

==Chemical==

Most rock forms at elevated temperature and pressure, and the minerals making up the rock are often chemically unstable in the relatively cool, wet, and oxidizing conditions typical of the Earth&#x27;s surface. Chemical weathering takes place when water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other chemical substances react with rock to change its composition. These reactions convert some of the original &quot;primary&quot; minerals in the rock to &quot;secondary&quot; minerals, remove other substances as solutes, and leave the most stable minerals as a chemically unchanged &quot;resistate&quot;. In effect, chemical weathering changes the original set of minerals in the rock into a new set of minerals that is in closer equilibrium with surface conditions. True equilibrium is rarely reached, because weathering is a slow process, and leaching carries away solutes produced by weathering reactions before they can accumulate to equilibrium levels. This is particularly true in tropical environments.

Water is the principal agent of chemical weathering, converting many primary minerals to clay minerals or hydrated oxides via reactions collectively described as hydrolysis. Oxygen is also important, acting to oxidize many minerals, as is carbon dioxide, whose weathering reactions are described as carbonation.

The process of mountain block uplift is important in exposing new rock strata to the atmosphere and moisture, enabling important chemical weathering to occur; significant release occurs of Ca2+ and other ions into surface waters.

===Dissolution===

Dissolution (also called &quot;simple solution&quot; or &quot;congruent dissolution&quot;) is the process in which a mineral dissolves completely without producing any new solid substance. Rainwater easily dissolves soluble minerals, such as halite or gypsum, but can also dissolve highly resistant minerals such as quartz, given sufficient time. Water breaks the bonds between atoms in the crystal:

The overall reaction for dissolution of quartz is

The dissolved quartz takes the form of silicic acid.

A particularly important form of dissolution is carbonate dissolution, in which atmospheric carbon dioxide enhances solution weathering. Carbonate dissolution affects rocks containing calcium carbonate, such as limestone and chalk. It takes place when rainwater combines with carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid, a weak acid, which dissolves calcium carbonate (limestone) and forms soluble calcium bicarbonate. Despite a slower reaction kinetics, this process is thermodynamically favored at low temperature, because colder water holds more dissolved carbon dioxide gas (due to the retrograde solubility of gases). Carbonate dissolution is therefore an important feature of glacial weathering.

Carbonate dissolution involves the following steps:

:CO2 + H2O → H2CO3
:carbon dioxide + water → carbonic acid

:H2CO3 + CaCO3 → Ca(HCO3)2
:carbonic acid + calcium carbonate → calcium bicarbonate

Carbonate dissolution on the surface of well-jointed limestone produces a dissected limestone pavement. This process is most effective along the joints, widening and deepening them.

In unpolluted environments, the pH of rainwater due to dissolved carbon dioxide is around 5.6. Acid rain occurs when gases such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are present in the atmosphere. These oxides react in the rain water to produce stronger acids and can lower the pH to 4.5 or even 3.0. Sulfur dioxide, SO2, comes from volcanic eruptions or from fossil fuels, and can become sulfuric acid within rainwater, which can cause solution weathering to the rocks on which it falls.

===Hydrolysis and carbonation===

Hydrolysis (also called &quot;incongruent dissolution&quot;) is a form of chemical weathering in which only part of a mineral is taken into solution. The rest of the mineral is transformed into a new solid material, such as a clay mineral. For example, forsterite (magnesium olivine) is hydrolyzed into solid brucite and dissolved silicic acid:

:Mg2SiO4 + 4 H2O ⇌ 2 Mg(OH)2 + H4SiO4
:forsterite + water ⇌ brucite + silicic acid

Most hydrolysis during weathering of minerals is &quot;acid hydrolysis&quot;, in which protons (hydrogen ions), which are present in acidic water, attack chemical bonds in mineral crystals. The bonds between different cations and oxygen ions in minerals differ in strength, and the weakest will be attacked first. The result is that minerals in igneous rock weather in roughly the same order in which they were originally formed (Bowen&#x27;s Reaction Series). Relative bond strength is shown in the following table: 
This table is only a rough guide to order of weathering. Some minerals, such as illite, are unusually stable, while silica is unusually unstable given the strength of the silicon–oxygen bond.

Carbon dioxide that dissolves in water to form carbonic acid is the most important source of protons, but organic acids are also important natural sources of acidity. Acid hydrolysis from dissolved carbon dioxide is sometimes described as &quot;carbonation&quot;, and can result in weathering of the primary minerals to secondary carbonate minerals. For example, weathering of forsterite can produce magnesite instead of brucite via the reaction:

:Mg2SiO4 + 2 CO2 + 2 H2O ⇌ 2 MgCO3 + H4SiO4 
:forsterite + carbon dioxide + water ⇌ magnesite + silicic acid in solution

Carbonic acid is consumed by silicate weathering, resulting in more alkaline solutions because of the bicarbonate. This is an important reaction in controlling the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and can affect climate.

Aluminosilicates containing highly soluble cations, such as sodium or potassium ions, will release the cations as dissolved bicarbonates during acid hydrolysis:

:2 KAlSi3O8 + 2 H2CO3 + 9 H2O ⇌ Al2Si2O5(OH)4 + 4 H4SiO4 + 2 K+ + 2 HCO3−
:orthoclase (aluminosilicate feldspar) + carbonic acid + water ⇌ kaolinite (a clay mineral) + silicic acid in solution + potassium and bicarbonate ions in solution

===Oxidation===
Within the weathering environment, chemical oxidation of a variety of metals occurs. The most commonly observed is the oxidation of Fe2+ (iron) by oxygen and water to form Fe3+ oxides and hydroxides such as goethite, limonite, and hematite. This gives the affected rocks a reddish-brown coloration on the surface which crumbles easily and weakens the rock. Many other metallic ores and minerals oxidize and hydrate to produce colored deposits, as does sulfur during the weathering of sulfide minerals such as chalcopyrites or CuFeS2 oxidizing to copper hydroxide and iron oxides.

===Hydration===
Mineral hydration is a form of chemical weathering that involves the rigid attachment of water molecules or H+ and OH- ions to the atoms and molecules of a mineral. No significant dissolution takes place. For example, iron oxides are converted to iron hydroxides and the hydration of anhydrite forms gypsum.

Bulk hydration of minerals is secondary in importance to dissolution, hydrolysis, and oxidation, but hydration of the crystal surface is the crucial first step in hydrolysis. A fresh surface of a mineral crystal exposes ions whose electrical charge attracts water molecules. Some of these molecules break into H+ that bonds to exposed anions (usually oxygen) and OH- that bonds to exposed cations. This further disrupts the surface, making it susceptible to various hydrolysis reactions. Additional protons replace cations exposed on the surface, freeing the cations as solutes. As cations are removed, silicon-oxygen and silicon-aluminium bonds become more susceptible to hydrolysis, freeing silicic acid and aluminium hydroxides to be leached away or to form clay minerals. Laboratory experiments show that weathering of feldspar crystals begins at dislocations or other defects on the surface of the crystal, and that the weathering layer is only a few atoms thick. Diffusion within the mineral grain does not appear to be significant.

===Biological===
Mineral weathering can also be initiated or accelerated by soil microorganisms. Soil organisms make up about 10 mg/cm3 of typical soils, and laboratory experiments have demonstrated that albite and muscovite weather twice as fast in live versus sterile soil. Lichens on rocks are among the most effective biological agents of chemical weathering. For example, an experimental study on hornblende granite in New Jersey, US, demonstrated a 3x – 4x increase in weathering rate under lichen covered surfaces compared to recently exposed bare rock surfaces.
The most common forms of biological weathering result from the release of chelating compounds (such as certain organic acids and siderophores) and of carbon dioxide and organic acids by plants. Roots can build up the carbon dioxide level to 30% of all soil gases, aided by adsorption of on clay minerals and the very slow diffusion rate of out of the soil. The and organic acids help break down aluminium- and iron-containing compounds in the soils beneath them. Roots have a negative electrical charge balanced by protons in the soil next to the roots, and these can be exchanged for essential nutrient cations such as potassium. Decaying remains of dead plants in soil may form organic acids which, when dissolved in water, cause chemical weathering. Chelating compounds, mostly low molecular weight organic acids, are capable of removing metal ions from bare rock surfaces, with aluminium and silicon being particularly susceptible. The ability to break down bare rock allows lichens to be among the first colonizers of dry land. The accumulation of chelating compounds can easily affect surrounding rocks and soils, and may lead to podsolisation of soils.

The symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi associated with tree root systems can release inorganic nutrients from minerals such as apatite or biotite and transfer these nutrients to the trees, thus contributing to tree nutrition. It was also recently evidenced that bacterial communities can impact mineral stability leading to the release of inorganic nutrients. A large range of bacterial strains or communities from diverse genera have been reported to be able to colonize mineral surfaces or to weather minerals, and for some of them a plant growth promoting effect has been demonstrated. The demonstrated or hypothesised mechanisms used by bacteria to weather minerals include several oxidoreduction and dissolution reactions as well as the production of weathering agents, such as protons, organic acids and chelating molecules.

==Ocean floor==
Weathering of basaltic oceanic crust differs in important respects from weathering in the atmosphere. Weathering is relatively slow, with basalt becoming less dense, at a rate of about 15% per 100 million years. The basalt becomes hydrated, and is enriched in total and ferric iron, magnesium, and sodium at the expense of silica, titanium, aluminum, ferrous iron, and calcium.

==Buildings==

Buildings made of any stone, brick or concrete are susceptible to the same weathering agents as any exposed rock surface. Also statues, monuments and ornamental stonework can be badly damaged by natural weathering processes. This is accelerated in areas severely affected by acid rain.

Accelerated building weathering may be a threat to the environment and occupant safety. Design strategies can moderate the impact of environmental effects, such as using of pressure-moderated rain screening, ensuring that the HVAC system is able to effectively control humidity accumulation and selecting concrete mixes with reduced water content to minimize the impact of freeze-thaw cycles. 

==Soil==
Granitic rock, the most abundant crystalline rock exposed at the Earth&#x27;s surface, begins weathering with the destruction of hornblende. Biotite then weathers to vermiculite, and finally oligoclase and microcline are destroyed. All are converted into a mixture of clay minerals and iron oxides. The resulting soil is depleted in calcium, sodium, and ferrous iron compared with the bedrock, and magnesium is reduced by 40% and silicon by 15%. At the same time, the soil is enriched in aluminium and potassium by at least 50%; by titanium, whose abundance triples, and ferric iron, whose abundance increases by an order of magnitude compared with the bedrock.

Basaltic rock is more easily weathered than granitic rock due to its formation at higher temperatures and drier conditions. The fine grain size and presence of volcanic glass also hasten weathering. In tropical settings, it rapidly weathers to clay minerals, aluminium hydroxides, and titanium-enriched iron oxides. Because most basalt is relatively poor in potassium, the basalt weathers directly to potassium-poor montmorillonite, then to kaolinite. Where leaching is continuous and intense, as in rain forests, the final weathering product is bauxite, the principal ore of aluminium. Where rainfall is intense but seasonal, as in monsoon climates, the final weathering product is iron- and titanium-rich laterite. Conversion of kaolinite to bauxite occurs only with intense leaching, as ordinary river water is in equilibrium with kaolinite.

Soil formation requires between 100 and 1,000 years, a brief interval in geologic time. As a result, some formations show numerous paleosol (fossil soil) beds. For example, the Willwood Formation of Wyoming contains over 1,000 paleosol layers in a section representing 3.5 million years of geologic time. Paleosols have been identified in formations as old as Archean (over 2.5 billion years in age). They are difficult to recognize in the geologic record. Indications that a sedimentary bed is a paleosol include a gradational lower boundary and sharp upper boundary, the presence of much clay, poor sorting with few sedimentary structures, rip-up clasts in overlying beds, and desiccation cracks containing material from higher beds.

The degree of weathering of soil can be expressed as the &quot;chemical index of alteration&quot;, defined as . This varies from 47 for unweathered upper crust rock to 100 for fully weathered material.

==Wood, paint and plastic==
Wood can be physically and chemically weathered by hydrolysis and other processes relevant to minerals and is highly susceptible to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight. This induces photochemical reactions that degrade its surface. These also significantly weather paint and plastics.

<text>Simon Stevin (; 1548–1620), sometimes called Stevinus, was a Flemish mathematician, scientist and music theorist. He made various contributions in many areas of science and engineering, both theoretical and practical. He also translated various mathematical terms into Dutch, making it one of the few European languages in which the word for mathematics, &quot;&quot; (&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, i.e., &quot;the knowledge of what is certain&quot;), was not a loanword from Greek but a calque via Latin. He also replaced the word &quot;&quot;, the Dutch for chemistry, by &quot;&quot; (&quot;the art of separating&quot;), made in analogy with &quot;&quot;.

== Biography ==
Very little is known with certainty about Simon Stevin&#x27;s life, and what we know is mostly inferred from other recorded facts. The exact birth date and the date and place of his death are uncertain. It is assumed he was born in Bruges, since he enrolled at Leiden University under the name &quot;Simon Stevinus Da Brugensis&quot; (meaning &quot;Simon Stevin from Bruges&quot;). His name is usually written as Stevin, but some documents regarding his father use the spelling &quot;Stevijn&quot; (pronunciation [ˈste:vεɪn]); this was a common spelling shift in 16th-century Dutch. 
Simon Stevin&#x27;s mother, Cathelijne (or Catelyne), was the daughter of a wealthy family from Ypres; her father Hubert was a poorter of Bruges. Cathelijne would later marry Joost Sayon, who was involved in the carpet and silk trade and was a member of the schuttersgilde Sint-Sebastiaan. Through her marriage, Cathelijne became a member of a family of Calvinists; it is thought that Simon Stevin was likely brought up in the Calvinist faith.

It is believed that Stevin grew up in a relatively affluent environment and enjoyed a good education. He was likely educated at a Latin school in his hometown.

=== Simon Stevin&#x27;s travels ===
Stevin left Bruges in 1571 apparently without a particular destination. Stevin was most likely a Calvinist since a Catholic would likely not have risen to the position of trust he later occupied with Maurice, Prince of Orange. It is assumed that he left Bruges to escape the religious persecution of Protestants by the Spanish rulers. Based on references in his work &quot;Wisconstighe Ghedaechtenissen&quot; (Mathematical Memoirs), it has been inferred that he must have moved first to Antwerp where he began his career as a merchant&#x27;s clerk. Some biographers mention that he travelled to Prussia, Poland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden and other parts of Northern Europe, between 1571 and 1577. It is possible that he completed these travels over a longer period of time. In 1577 Simon Stevin returned to Bruges and was appointed city clerk by the aldermen of Bruges, a function he occupied from 1577 to 1581. He worked in the office of Jan de Brune of the Brugse Vrije, the castellany of Bruges.

Why he had returned to Bruges in 1577 is not clear. It may have been related to the political events of that period. Bruges was the scene of intense religious conflict. Catholics and Calvinists alternately controlled the government of the city. They usually opposed each other but would occasionally collaborate in order to counteract the dictates of King Philip II of Spain. In 1576 a certain level of official religious tolerance was decreed. This could explain why Stevin returned to Bruges in 1577. Later the Calvinists seized power in many Flemish cities and incarcerated Catholic clerics and secular governors supportive of the Spanish rulers. Between 1578 and 1584 Bruges was ruled by Calvinists.

=== Simon Stevin in the Netherlands ===
In 1581 Stevin again left his native Bruges and moved to Leiden where he attended the Latin school. On 16 February 1583 he enrolled, under the name &quot;Simon Stevinus Brugensis&quot; (meaning &quot;Simon Stevin from Bruges&quot;), at Leiden University, which had been founded by William the Silent in 1575. Here he befriended William the Silent&#x27;s second son and heir Prince Maurice, the Count of Nassau. Stevin is listed in the university&#x27;s registers until 1590 and apparently never graduated.

Following William the Silent&#x27;s assassination and Prince Maurice&#x27;s assumption of his father&#x27;s office, Stevin became the principal advisor and tutor of Prince Maurice. Prince Maurice asked his advice on many occasions, and made him a public officer – at first director of the so-called &quot;waterstaet&quot; (the government authority for public works, especially water management) from 1592, and later quartermaster-general of the army of the States-General. Prince Maurice also asked Stevin to found an engineering school within the University of Leiden.

Stevin moved to The Hague where he bought a house in 1612. He married in 1610 or 1614 and had four children. It is known that he left a widow with two children at his death in Leiden or The Hague in 1620.
== Discoveries and inventions ==
Stevin is responsible for many discoveries and inventions. Stevin wrote numerous bestselling books, and he was a pioneer of the development and the practical application of (engineering related) science such as mathematics, physics and applied science like hydraulic engineering and surveying. He was thought to have invented the decimal fractions until the middle of the 20th century, when researchers discovered that decimal fractions had been previously introduced by the medieval Islamic scholar al-Uqlidisi in a book written in 952. Moreover, a systematic development of decimal fractions was given well before Stevin in the book &quot;Miftah al-Hisab&quot; written in 1427 by Al-Kashi.

His contemporaries were most struck by his invention of a so-called land yacht, a carriage with sails, of which a model was preserved in Scheveningen until 1802. The carriage itself had been lost long before. Around the year 1600 Stevin, with Prince Maurice of Orange and twenty-six others, used the carriage on the beach between Scheveningen and Petten. The carriage was propelled solely by the force of wind and acquired a speed which exceeded that of horses. 

=== Management of waterways ===
Stevin&#x27;s work in the &quot;waterstaet&quot; involved improvements to the sluices and spillways to control flooding, exercises in hydraulic engineering. Windmills were already in use to pump the water out but in &quot;Van de Molens&quot; (&quot;On mills&quot;), he suggested improvements including ideas that the wheels should move slowly with a better system for meshing of the gear teeth. These improved threefold the efficiency of the windmills used in pumping water out of the polders. He received a patent on his innovation in 1586.

=== Philosophy of science ===
Stevin&#x27;s aim was to bring about a second age of wisdom, in which mankind would have recovered all of its earlier knowledge. He deduced that the language spoken in this age would have to be Dutch, because, as he showed empirically, in that language, more concepts could be indicated with monosyllabic words than in any of the (European) languages he had compared it with. This was one of the reasons why he wrote all of his works in Dutch and left the translation of them for others to do. The other reason was that he wanted his works to be practically useful to people who had not mastered the common scientific language of the time, Latin. Thanks to Simon Stevin the Dutch language got its proper scientific vocabulary such as &quot;wiskunde&quot; (&quot;kunst van het gewisse of zekere&quot; the art of what is known or what is certain) for mathematics, &quot;natuurkunde&quot; (the &quot;art of nature&quot;) for physics, &quot;scheikunde&quot; (the &quot;art of separation&quot;) for chemistry, &quot;sterrenkunde&quot; (the &quot;art of stars&quot;) for astronomy, &quot;meetkunde&quot; (the &quot;art of measuring&quot;) for geometry.

=== Geometry, physics and trigonometry ===

Stevin was the first to show how to model regular and semiregular polyhedra by delineating their frames in a plane. He also distinguished stable from unstable equilibria.

Stevin contributed to trigonometry with his book, &quot;De Driehouckhandel&quot;.

In &quot;The First Book of the Elements of the Art of Weighing, The second part: Of the propositions [The Properties of Oblique Weights], Page 41, Theorem XI, Proposition XIX&quot;, he derived the condition for the balance of forces on inclined planes using a diagram with a &quot;wreath&quot; containing evenly spaced round masses resting on the planes of a triangular prism (see the illustration on the side). He concluded that the weights required were proportional to the lengths of the sides on which they rested assuming the third side was horizontal and that the effect of a weight was reduced in a similar manner. It is implicit that the reduction factor is the height of the triangle divided by the side (the sine of the angle of the side with respect to the horizontal). The proof diagram of this concept is known as the &quot;Epitaph of Stevinus&quot;. As noted by E. J. Dijksterhuis, Stevin&#x27;s proof of the equilibrium on an inclined plane can be faulted for using perpetual motion to imply a reductio ad absurdum. Dijksterhuis says Stevin &quot;intuitively made use of the principle of conservation of energy ... long before it was formulated explicitly&quot;.

He demonstrated the resolution of forces before Pierre Varignon, which had not been remarked previously, even though it is a simple consequence of the law of their composition.

Stevin discovered the hydrostatic paradox, which states that the pressure in a liquid is independent of the shape of the vessel and the area of the base, but depends solely on its height.

He also gave the measure for the pressure on any given portion of the side of a vessel.

He was the first to explain the tides using the attraction of the moon.

In 1586, he demonstrated that two objects of different weight fall with the same acceleration.

=== Music theory ===

The first mention of equal temperament related to the twelfth root of two in the West appeared in Simon Stevin&#x27;s unfinished manuscript &quot;Van de Spiegheling der singconst &quot;(ca 1605) published posthumously three hundred years later in 1884; however, due to insufficient accuracy of his calculation, many of the numbers (for string length) he obtained were off by one or two units from the correct values. He appears to have been inspired by the writings of the Italian lutenist and musical theorist Vincenzo Galilei (father of Galileo Galilei), a onetime pupil of Gioseffo Zarlino.

=== Bookkeeping ===

Double-entry bookkeeping may have been known to Stevin, as he was a clerk in Antwerp in his younger years, either practically or via the medium of the works of Italian authors such as Luca Pacioli and Gerolamo Cardano. However, Stevin was the first to recommend the use of impersonal accounts in the national household. He brought it into practice for Prince Maurice, and recommended it to the French statesman Sully.

=== Decimal fractions ===

Stevin wrote a 35-page booklet called &quot;De Thiende&quot; (&quot;the art of tenths&quot;), first published in Dutch in 1585 and translated into French as &quot;La Disme&quot;. The full title of the English translation was &quot;Decimal arithmetic: Teaching how to perform all computations whatsoever by whole numbers without fractions, by the four principles of common arithmetic: namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.&quot; The concepts referred to in the booklet included unit fractions and Egyptian fractions. Muslim mathematicians were the first to utilize decimals instead of fractions on a large scale. Al-Kashi&#x27;s book, &quot;Key to Arithmetic&quot;, was written at the beginning of the 15th century and was the stimulus for the systematic application of decimals to whole numbers and fractions thereof. But nobody established their daily use before Stevin. He felt that this innovation was so significant, that he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures and weights to be merely a question of time.

His notation is rather unwieldy. The point separating the integers from the decimal fractions seems to be the invention of Bartholomaeus Pitiscus, in whose trigonometrical tables (1612) it occurs, and it was accepted by John Napier in his logarithmic papers (1614 and 1619).

Stevin printed little circles around the exponents of the different powers of one-tenth. That Stevin intended these encircled numerals to denote mere exponents is clear from the fact that he employed the same symbol for powers of algebraic quantities. He did not avoid fractional exponents; only negative exponents do not appear in his work.

Stevin wrote on other scientific subjects – for instance optics, geography, astronomy – and a number of his writings were translated into Latin by W. Snellius (Willebrord Snell). There are two complete editions in French of his works, both printed in Leiden, one in 1608, the other in 1634.

=== Mathematics ===

Stevin wrote his &quot;Arithmetic&quot; in 1594. The work brought to the western world for the first time a general solution of the quadratic equation, originally documented nearly a millennium previously by Brahmagupta in India.

According to Van der Waerden, Stevin eliminated &quot;the classical restriction of &#x27;numbers&#x27; to integers (Euclid) or to rational fractions (Diophantos)...the real numbers formed a continuum. His general notion of a real number was accepted, tacitly or explicitly, by all later scientists&quot;. A recent study attributes a greater role to Stevin in developing the real numbers than has been acknowledged by Weierstrass&#x27;s followers. Stevin proved the intermediate value theorem for polynomials, anticipating Cauchy&#x27;s proof thereof. Stevin uses a divide and conquer procedure, subdividing the interval into ten equal parts. Stevin&#x27;s decimals were the inspiration for Isaac Newton&#x27;s work on infinite series.

=== Neologisms ===

Stevin thought the Dutch language to be excellent for scientific writing, and he translated many of the mathematical terms to Dutch. As a result, Dutch is one of the few Western European languages that have many mathematical terms that do not stem from Greek or Latin. This includes the very name &quot;wiskunde&quot; (mathematics).

His eye for the importance of having the scientific language be the same as the language of the craftsman may show from the dedication of his book &quot;De Thiende&quot; (&#x27;The Disme&#x27; or &#x27;The Tenth&#x27;): &#x27;Simon Stevin wishes the stargazers, surveyors, carpet measurers, body measurers in general, coin measurers and tradespeople good luck.&#x27; Further on in the same pamphlet, he writes: &quot;[this text] teaches us all calculations that are needed by the people without using fractions. One can reduce all operations to adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing with integers.&quot;

Some of the words he invented evolved: &#x27;aftrekken&#x27; (&quot;subtract&quot;) and &#x27;delen&#x27; (&quot;divide&quot;) stayed the same, but over time &#x27;menigvuldigen&#x27; became &#x27;vermenigvuldigen&#x27; (&quot;multiply&quot;, the added &#x27;ver&#x27; emphasizes the fact it is an action). &#x27;Vergaderen&#x27; (&quot;gathering&quot;) became &#x27;optellen&#x27; (&quot;add&quot; lit. &quot;count up&quot;).

Another example is the Dutch word for diameter: &#x27;middellijn&#x27;, lit.: line through the middle.

The word &#x27;zomenigmaal&#x27; (&quot;quotient&quot; lit. &#x27;that many times&#x27;) has been replaced by &#x27;quotiënt&#x27; in modern-day Dutch.

Other terms did not make it into modern day mathematical Dutch, like &#x27;teerling&#x27; (&quot;die&quot;, although still being used in the meaning as die), instead of cube.

== Legacy ==
Following his life, Belgium and the city of Bruges have continued to name places, statues and other topics in honor of Stevin

* In 1839, the city of Bruges and the government of West Flanders commissioned the creation of Simon Stevinplein (Simon Stevin Square) in honor of Stevin. The square features a statue of Stevin, which was made by Eugène Simonis and was officially unveiled in 1847. The statue features a scroll showcasing Stevin&#x27;s proof of the law of equilibrium on an inclined plane.
* On 25 May 2012, VLOOT dab, a Belgian government-ran ferry and vessel company, launched the RV Simon Stevin, a vessel created for oceanographic research off the port of Ostend, in Southern Bight of the North Sea, and in the eastern part of the English Channel.
* The Dutch Research Council (NWO), established a scientific award named after Stevin in 2018, the Stevin Prize, which highlights contributions that bridge the gap between scientific research and practical applications that benefit society.
* The study association of mechanical engineering at the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, W.S.V. Simon Stevin, is named after Simon Stevin. In Stevin&#x27;s memory, the association calls its bar &quot;De Weeghconst&quot; and owns a self-built fleet of land yachts.

== Publications ==

<text>Frederick I (; 11 July 1657 – 25 February 1713), of the Hohenzollern dynasty, was (as Frederick III) Elector of Brandenburg (1688–1713) and Duke of Prussia in personal union (Brandenburg-Prussia). The latter function he upgraded to royalty, becoming the first King in Prussia (1701–1713). From 1707 he was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel.

==Biography==

===Family===
Born in Königsberg, Frederick was the third son of Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg by his father&#x27;s first marriage to Louise Henriette of Orange-Nassau, eldest daughter of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange and Amalia of Solms-Braunfels. His maternal cousin was King William III of England. Upon the death of his father on 29 April 1688, Frederick became Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia. Right after ascending the throne Frederick founded a new city southerly adjacent to Dorotheenstadt and named it after himself, the Friedrichstadt.

===Military career===
Frederick was noted for his opposition to France, in contrast to his father who had sought an alliance with Louis XIV. Frederick took Brandenburg into the League of Augsburg against France and in 1689 led military forces into the field as part of the allied coalition. That year an army under his command besieged and captured Bonn. Despite this opposition to France (a characteristic that was even more prominent in his son and heir) he was fond of French culture, and styled his court in imitation of that of Louis XIV.

===Reign as King===

The Hohenzollern state was then known as Brandenburg-Prussia. The family&#x27;s main possessions were the Margraviate of Brandenburg within the Holy Roman Empire and the Duchy of Prussia outside of the Empire, ruled as a personal union. Although he was the Margrave and Prince-elector of Brandenburg and the Duke of Prussia, Frederick desired the more prestigious title of king. However, according to Germanic law at that time, no kingdoms could exist within the Holy Roman Empire, with the exception of the Kingdom of Bohemia which belonged to the Holy Roman Emperor.

Frederick persuaded Emperor Leopold I to allow Prussia to be elevated to a kingdom by the Crown Treaty of 16 November 1700. This agreement was ostensibly given in exchange for an alliance against King Louis XIV in the War of the Spanish Succession and the provision of 8,000 Prussian troops to Leopold&#x27;s service. Frederick argued that Prussia had never been part of the Holy Roman Empire, and he ruled over it with full sovereignty. Therefore, he said, there was no legal or political barrier to letting him rule it as a kingdom. Frederick was aided in the negotiations by Charles Ancillon.

Frederick crowned himself on 18 January 1701 in Königsberg. Although he did so with the Emperor&#x27;s consent, and also with formal acknowledgement from Augustus II the Strong, Elector of Saxony, who held the title of King of Poland, the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth raised objections, and viewed the coronation as illegal. In fact, according to the terms of the Treaty of Wehlau and Bromberg, the House of Hohenzollern&#x27;s sovereignty over the Duchy of Prussia was not absolute but contingent on the continuation of the male line (in the absence of which the duchy would revert to the Polish crown). Therefore, out of deference to the region&#x27;s historic ties to the Polish crown, Frederick made the symbolic concession of calling himself &quot;King in Prussia&quot; instead of &quot;King of Prussia&quot;.

Frederick leveraged the recognizance of other nations to attempt to construct the legitimacy of his assumed royal title. In this, the English were his most willing diplomatic allies. They first sent an envoy to Berlin, who conformed to the new royal protocol. Thereafter, they sent an ambassador to Berlin, who ceremonially recognised Frederick as king. In exchange, Frederick provided England with troops during the War of the Spanish Succession, though he often withheld these until he received the ceremonial concessions he desired.

His royalty was, in any case, limited to Prussia and did not reduce the rights of the Emperor in the portions of his domains that were still part of the Holy Roman Empire. In other words, while he was a king in Prussia, he was still only an elector under the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Emperor in Brandenburg. Legally, the Hohenzollern state was still a personal union between Brandenburg and Prussia. However, by the time Frederick crowned himself as king, the emperor&#x27;s authority over Brandenburg (and the rest of the empire) was only nominal, and in practice it soon came to be treated as part of the Prussian kingdom rather than as a separate entity. His grandson, Frederick the Great, was the first Prussian king formally to style himself &quot;King of Prussia&quot; (from 1772 onwards).

Frederick was a patron of the arts and learning. The Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin was founded by Frederick in 1696, as was the Academy of Sciences in 1700, though the latter was closed down by his son as an economic measure; it was reopened in 1740 by his grandson, Frederick II. Frederick also appointed Jacob Paul von Gundling as Professor of History and Law at the Berlin Knights Academy in 1705, and as historian at the Higher Herald&#x27;s Office in 1706.

Frederick died in Berlin in 1713 and is entombed in the Berlin Cathedral.

His grandson, Frederick the Great, referred to Frederick I as &quot;the mercenary king&quot;, due to the fact that he greatly profited from the hiring of his Prussian troops to defend other territories, such as in northern Italy against the French. &quot;All in all,&quot; he wrote of his grandfather, &quot;he was great in small matters, and small in great matters.&quot;

=== Marriages and children ===

Frederick was married three times:
* first, in 1679, to Elizabeth Henrietta of Hesse-Kassel (1661–1683), with whom he had one child, 
** Louise Dorothea, born 1680, who died without issue at age 25.
* then to Sophia Charlotte of Hanover (1668–1705), with whom he had 
** Frederick August (6 October 1685 – 31 January 1686) died in infancy.
** Frederick William I, born in 1688, who succeeded him.
* In 1708, he married Sophia Louise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, who survived him but had no children by him. 
He also had an official mistress, Catharina von Wartenberg, between 1696 and 1711. However, he was never known to make use of her services, being deeply in love with his second wife.

<doc id="72588" wikidata="Q309974" url="?curid=72588" title="Jean Giraudoux">
<text>Hippolyte Jean Giraudoux (; ; 29 October 1882 – 31 January 1944) was a French novelist, essayist, diplomat and playwright. He is considered among the most important French dramatists of the period between World War I and World War II. 

His work is noted for its stylistic elegance and poetic fantasy. Giraudoux&#x27;s dominant theme is the relationship between man and woman—or in some cases, between man and some unattainable ideal.

==Biography==
Giraudoux was born in Bellac, Haute-Vienne, where his father, Léger Giraudoux, worked for the Ministry of Transport. Giraudoux studied at the Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux and upon graduation traveled extensively in Europe. After his return to France in 1910, he accepted a position with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. With the outbreak of World War I, he served with distinction and in 1915 became the first writer ever to be awarded the wartime Legion of Honour.

He married in 1918 and in the subsequent inter-war period produced the majority of his writing. He first achieved literary success through his novels, notably &quot;Siegfried et le Limousin&quot; (1922) and &quot;Eglantine&quot; (1927). An ongoing collaboration with actor and theater director Louis Jouvet, beginning in 1928 with Jouvet&#x27;s radical streamlining of &quot;Siegfried&quot; for the stage, stimulated his writing. But it is his plays that gained him international renown. He became well known in the English speaking world largely because of the award-winning adaptations of his plays by Christopher Fry (&quot;Tiger at the Gates&quot;) and Maurice Valency (&quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;, &quot;Ondine&quot;, &quot;The Enchanted&quot;, &quot;The Apollo of Bellac&quot;).

Giraudoux served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal, a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians. In politics he was affiliated with the Radical Party, served in the cabinet of Édouard Herriot in 1932, and was appointed as Minister of Information by Édouard Daladier in 1939.

He is buried in the Cimetière de Passy in Paris.

<text>Eugène Ionesco (; ; born Eugen Ionescu, ; 26 November 1909 – 28 March 1994) was a Romanian-French playwright who wrote mostly in French, and was one of the foremost figures of the French avant-garde theatre in the 20th century. Ionesco instigated a revolution in ideas and techniques of drama, beginning with his &quot;anti play&quot;, &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; which contributed to the beginnings of what is known as the Theatre of the Absurd, which includes a number of plays that, following the ideas of the philosopher Albert Camus, explore concepts of absurdism and surrealism. He was made a member of the Académie française in 1970, and was awarded the 1970 Austrian State Prize for European Literature, and the 1973 Jerusalem Prize.

==Biography==
Ionesco was born in Slatina, Romania. His father belonged to the Orthodox Christian church. His mother was of French and Romanian heritage. According to some sources, her faith was Protestant (the faith into which her father was born and to which her originally Greek Orthodox Christian mother had converted). According to other sources, his mother was Jewish; however, this has been contested by his niece. Eugène was baptized into the Orthodox Christian faith. Many sources cite his birthdate as 1912, this error being due to vanity on the part of Ionesco himself, who wanted the year of his birth to coincide with that of when his idol, Romanian playwright Caragiale, died.

He spent most of his childhood in France and, while there, had an experience he claimed affected his perception of the world more significantly than any other. As Deborah B. Gaensbauer describes in &quot;Eugène Ionesco Revisited&quot;, &quot;Walking in summer sunshine in a white-washed provincial village under an intense blue sky, [Ionesco] was profoundly altered by the light.&quot; He was struck very suddenly with a feeling of intense luminosity, the feeling of floating off the ground and an overwhelming feeling of well-being. When he &quot;floated&quot; back to the ground and the &quot;light&quot; left him, he saw that the real world in comparison was full of decay, corruption and meaningless repetitive action. This also coincided with the revelation that death takes everyone in the end. Much of his later work, reflecting this new perception, demonstrates a disgust for the tangible world, a distrust of communication, and the subtle sense that a better world lies just beyond our reach. Echoes of this experience can also be seen in references and themes in many of his important works: characters pining for an unattainable &quot;city of lights&quot; (&quot;The Killer&quot;, &quot;The Chairs&quot;) or perceiving a world beyond (&quot;A Stroll in the Air&quot;); characters granted the ability to fly (&quot;A Stroll in the Air&quot;, &quot;Amédée&quot;, &quot;Victims of Duty&quot;); the banality of the world which often leads to depression (the Bérenger character); ecstatic revelations of beauty within a pessimistic framework (&quot;Amédée&quot;, &quot;The Chairs&quot;, the Bérenger character); and the inevitability of death (&quot;Exit the King&quot;).

He returned to Romania with his father and mother in 1925 after his parents divorced. There he attended Saint Sava National College, after which he studied French Literature at the University of Bucharest from 1928 to 1933 and qualified as a teacher of French. While there he met Emil Cioran and Mircea Eliade, and the three became lifelong friends.

In 1936, Ionesco married Rodica Burileanu. They had one daughter, Marie-France Ionesco, for whom he wrote a number of unconventional children&#x27;s stories. With his family, he returned to France in 1938 to complete his doctoral thesis. Caught by the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he returned to Romania, but soon changed his mind and, with the help of friends, obtained travel documents which allowed him to return to France in 1942, where he remained during the rest of the war, living in Marseille and then moving with his family to Paris after its liberation.

==Literary career==

===Writing in Romania===
Though best known as a playwright, plays were not his first chosen medium. He started writing poetry and criticism, publishing in several Romanian journals. Two early writings of note are &quot;Nu&quot;, a book criticizing many other writers, including prominent Romanian poets, and &quot;Hugoliade, or, The grotesque and tragic life of Victor Hugo&quot; a satirical biography mocking Victor Hugo&#x27;s status as a great figure in French literature. The &quot;Hugoliade&quot; includes exaggerated retellings of the most scandalous episodes in Hugo&#x27;s life and contains prototypes for many of Ionesco&#x27;s later themes: the ridiculous authoritarian character, the false worship of language.

===Origins of his first play===
Ionesco began his theatre career later in life; he did not write his first play until 1948 (&quot;La Cantatrice chauve&quot;, first performed in 1950 with the English title &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot;). At the age of 40, he decided to learn English using the Assimil method, conscientiously copying whole sentences in order to memorize them. Re-reading them, he began to feel that he was not learning English, rather he was discovering some astonishing truths such as the fact that there are seven days in a week, that the ceiling is up and the floor is down; things which he already knew, but which suddenly struck him as being as stupefying as they were indisputably true.

This feeling intensified with the introduction in later lessons of the characters known as &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&quot;. To her husband&#x27;s astonishment, Mrs. Smith informed him that they had several children, that they lived in the vicinity of London, that their name was Smith, that Mr. Smith was a clerk, and that they had a servant, Mary, who was English like themselves. What was remarkable about Mrs. Smith, Ionesco thought, was her eminently methodical procedure in her quest for truth. For Ionesco, the clichés and truisms of the conversation primer disintegrated into wild caricature and parody with language itself disintegrating into disjointed fragments of words. Ionesco set about translating this experience into a play, &quot;La Cantatrice Chauve&quot;, which was performed for the first time in 1950 under the direction of Nicolas Bataille. It was far from a success and went unnoticed until a few established writers and critics, among them Jean Anouilh and Raymond Queneau, championed the play.

===Early plays===
Ionesco&#x27;s earliest theatrical works, considered to be his most innovative, were one-act plays or extended sketches: &quot;La Cantatrice chauve&quot; translated as &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; or &quot;The Bald Prima Donna&quot; (written 1948), &quot;Jacques ou la soumission&quot; translated as &quot;Jack, or The Submission&quot; (1950), &quot;La Leçon&quot; translated as &quot;The Lesson&quot; (1950), &quot;Les Salutations&quot; translated as &quot;Salutations&quot; (1950), &quot;Les Chaises&quot; translated as &quot;The Chairs&quot; (1951), &quot;L&#x27;Avenir est dans les oeufs&quot; translated as &quot;The Future is in Eggs&quot; (1951), &quot;Victimes du devoir&quot; translated as &quot;Victims of Duty&quot; (1952) and, finally, &quot;Le Nouveau locataire&quot; translated as &quot;The New Tenant&quot; (1953). These absurdist sketches, to which he gave such descriptions as &quot;anti-play&quot; (&quot;anti-pièce&quot; in French) express modern feelings of alienation and the impossibility and futility of communication with surreal comic force, parodying the conformism of the bourgeoisie and conventional theatrical forms. In them Ionesco rejects a conventional story-line as their basis, instead taking their dramatic structure from accelerating rhythms and/or cyclical repetitions. He disregards psychology and coherent dialogue, thereby depicting a dehumanized world with mechanical, puppet-like characters who speak in &quot;non-sequiturs&quot;. Language becomes rarefied, with words and material objects gaining a life of their own, increasingly overwhelming the characters and creating a sense of menace.

===The full-length plays===
With &quot;Tueur sans gages&quot; translated as &quot;The Killer&quot; (1959; his second full-length play, the first being &quot;Amédée, ou Comment s&#x27;en débarrasser&quot; in 1954), Ionesco began to explore more sustained dramatic situations featuring more humanized characters. Notably this includes Bérenger, a central character in a number of Ionesco&#x27;s plays, the last of which is &quot;Le Piéton de l&#x27;air&quot; translated as &quot;A Stroll in the Air&quot;.

Bérenger is a semi-autobiographical figure expressing Ionesco&#x27;s wonderment and anguish at the strangeness of reality. He is comically naïve, engaging the audience&#x27;s sympathy. In &quot;The Killer&quot; he encounters death in the figure of a serial killer. In &quot;Rhinocéros&quot; he watches his friends turning into rhinoceroses one by one until he alone stands unchanged against this mass movement. It is in this play that Ionesco most forcefully expresses his horror of ideological conformism, inspired by the rise of the fascist Iron Guard in Romania in the 1930s. &quot;Le Roi se meurt&quot; translated as &quot;Exit the King&quot; (1962) shows him as King Bérenger I, an everyman figure who struggles to come to terms with his own death.

===Later works===
Ionesco&#x27;s later work has generally received less attention. This includes &quot;La Soif et la faim&quot; translated as &quot;Hunger and Thirst&quot; (1966), &quot;Jeux de massacre&quot; (1971), &quot;Macbett&quot; (1972, a free adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;) and &quot;Ce formidable bordel&quot; (1973).

Ionesco also wrote his only novel, &quot;The Hermit&quot;, during this later period. It was first published in 1975.

Apart from the libretto for the opera &quot;Maximilien Kolbe&quot; (music by Dominique Probst) which has been performed in five countries, produced for television and recorded for release on CD, Ionesco did not write for the stage after &quot;Voyage chez les morts&quot; in 1981. However, &quot;La Cantatrice chauve&quot; is still playing at the Théâtre de la Huchette today, having moved there in 1952. It holds the world record for the play that has been staged continuously in the same theatre for the longest time.

===Theoretical writings===
Like Shaw and Brecht, Ionesco contributed to the theatre with his theoretical writings (Wellwarth, 33). Ionesco wrote mainly in attempts to correct critics whom he felt misunderstood his work and therefore wrongly influenced his audience. In doing so, Ionesco articulated ways in which he thought contemporary theatre should be reformed (Wellwarth, 33). &quot;Notes and Counter Notes&quot; is a collection of Ionesco&#x27;s writings, including musings on why he chose to write for the theatre and direct responses to his contemporary critics.

In the first section, titled &quot;Experience of the Theatre&quot;, Ionesco claimed to have hated going to the theatre as a child because it gave him &quot;no pleasure or feeling of participation&quot; (Ionesco, 15). He wrote that the problem with realistic theatre is that it is less interesting than theatre that invokes an &quot;imaginative truth&quot;, which he found to be much more interesting and freeing than the &quot;narrow&quot; truth presented by strict realism (Ionesco, 15). He claimed that &quot;drama that relies on simple effects is not necessarily drama simplified&quot; (Ionesco, 28). &quot;Notes and Counter Notes&quot; also reprints a heated war of words between Ionesco and Kenneth Tynan based on Ionesco&#x27;s beliefs and Ionesco&#x27;s hatred for Brecht and Brechtian theatre.

===Literary context===
Ionesco is often considered a writer of the Theatre of the Absurd, a label originally given to him by Martin Esslin in his book of the same name. Esslin, placed Ionesco alongside contemporaries Samuel Beckett, Jean Genet, and Arthur Adamov, calling this informal group &quot;absurd&quot; on the basis of Albert Camus&#x27; concept of the absurd. In Esslin&#x27;s view, Beckett and Ionesco better captured the meaninglessness of existence in their plays than works by Camus or Sartre. Because of this loose association, Ionesco is often mislabeled an existentialist. Ionesco claimed in &quot;Notes and Counter Notes&quot; that he was not an existentialist and often criticized existentialist figurehead Jean-Paul Sartre. Although Ionesco knew Beckett and honored his work, the French group of playwrights was far from an organized movement.

Ionesco on the metaphysics of death in &quot;Through Parisian Eyes: Reflections on Contemporary French Arts and Culture&quot; by Melinda Camber Porter: &quot;Death is our main problem and all others are less important. It is the wall and the limit. It is the only inescapable alienation; it gives us a sense of our limits. But the ignorance of ourselves and of others to which we are condemned is just as worrying. In the final analysis, we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing. Nevertheless, in all my work there is an element of hope and an appeal to others.&quot;

Ionesco claimed instead an affinity for ’Pataphysics and its creator Alfred Jarry. He was also a great admirer of the Dadaists and Surrealists, especially his fellow countryman Tristan Tzara. Ionesco became friends with André Breton, whom he revered. In &quot;Present Past, Past Present&quot;, Ionesco wrote &quot;Breton taught us to destroy the walls of the real that separate us from reality, to participate in being so as to live as if it were the first day of creation, a day that would every day be the first day of new creations.&quot; Raymond Queneau, a former associate of Breton and a champion of Ionesco&#x27;s work, was a member of the Collège de ’Pataphysique and a founder of Oulipo, two groups with which Ionesco was associated. Politically, Ionesco expressed sympathy with the left-libertarian Transnational Radical Party of Marco Pannella.

==Honours and awards==

Ionesco was made a member of the Académie française in 1970. He also received numerous awards including Tours Festival Prize for film, 1959; Prix Italia, 1963; Society of Authors Theatre Prize, 1966; Grand Prix National for theatre, 1969; Monaco Grand Prix, 1969; Austrian State Prize for European Literature, 1970; Jerusalem Prize, 1973; and honorary Doctoral Degrees from New York University and the Universities of Leuven, Warwick and Tel Aviv. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature eight times.

==Death==
Eugène Ionesco died at age 84 on 28 March 1994 and is buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris.

In 2009, the Romanian Academy granted posthumous membership to Ionesco.

<text>Pierre Carlet de Chamblain de Marivaux (; ; 4 February 1688 – 12 February 1763), commonly referred to as Marivaux, was a French playwright and novelist.

He is considered one of the most important French playwrights of the 18th century, writing numerous comedies for the Comédie-Française and the Comédie-Italienne of Paris. His most important works are &quot;Le Triomphe de l&#x27;amour&quot;, &quot;Le Jeu de l&#x27;amour et du hasard&quot; and &quot;Les Fausses Confidences&quot;. He also published a number of essays and two important but unfinished novels, &quot;La Vie de Marianne&quot; and &quot;Le Paysan parvenu&quot;.

==Life==
His father was a Norman financier whose name from birth was Carlet, but who assumed the surname of Chamblain, and then that of Marivaux. He brought up his family in Limoges and Riom, in the province of Auvergne, where he directed the mint.

Marivaux is said to have written his first play, the &quot;Père prudent et équitable&quot;, when he was only eighteen, but it was not published until 1712, when he was twenty-four. However, the young Marivaux concentrated more on writing novels than plays. In the three years from 1713 to 1715 he produced three novels – &quot;Effets surprenants de la sympathie&quot;; &quot;La Voiture embourbée&quot;, and a book which had three titles – &quot;Pharsamon&quot;, &quot;Les Folies romanesques&quot;, and &quot;Le Don Quichotte moderne&quot;. These books are very different from his later, more famous pieces: they are inspired by Spanish romances and the heroic novels of the preceding century, with a certain mixture of the marvelous.

Then Marivaux&#x27;s literary ardour entered a new phase. He parodied Homer to serve the cause of Antoine Houdar de La Motte, (1672–1731) an ingenious paradoxer; Marivaux had already done something similar for François Fénelon, whose &quot;Telemachus&quot; he parodied and updated as &quot;Le Telemaque travesti&quot; (written in 1714 but not published until 1736). His friendship with Antoine Houdar de La Motte introduced him to the &quot;Mercure&quot;, the chief newspaper of France, and he started writing articles for it in 1717. His work was noted for its keen observation and literary skill. His work showed the first signs of what is now called &quot;marivaudage,&quot; the flirtatious bantering tone characteristic of Marivaux&#x27;s dialogues. In 1742 he became acquainted with the then-unknown Jean-Jacques Rousseau, helping him revise a play, &quot;Narcissus,&quot; though it wasn&#x27;t produced till long afterwards.

Marivaux is reputed to have been a witty conversationalist, with a somewhat contradictory personality. He was extremely good-natured but fond of saying very severe things, unhesitating in his acceptance of favours (he drew a regular annuity from Claude Adrien Helvétius) but exceedingly touchy if he thought himself in any way slighted. At the same time, he was a great cultivator of sensibility and unsparingly criticized the rising &quot;philosophes&quot;. Perhaps for this reason, Voltaire became his enemy and often disparaged him. Marivaux&#x27;s friends included Helvétius, Claudine Guérin de Tencin, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and even Madame de Pompadour (who allegedly provided him with a pension). Marivaux had one daughter, who became a nun; the duke of Orleans, the regent&#x27;s successor, furnished her with her dowry.

==Literary career==

The early 1720s were very important for Marivaux; he wrote a comedy (now mostly lost) called &quot;L&#x27;Amour et la vérité&quot;, another comedy, &quot;Arlequin poli par l&#x27;amour&quot;, and an unsuccessful tragedy, &quot;Annibal&quot; (printed 1737). In about 1721, he married a Mlle Martin, but she died shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, he lost all of his inheritance money when he invested it in the Mississippi scheme. His pen now became almost his sole resource.

Marivaux had a connection with two fashionable theatres: &quot;Annibal&quot; had played at the Comédie Française and &quot;Arlequin poli&quot; at the Comédie Italienne. He also endeavoured to start a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Spectateur Français&quot;, to which he was the sole contributor. But his irregular work ethic killed the paper after less than two years. Thus, for nearly twenty years, the theatre, especially the Comédie Italienne, was Marivaux&#x27;s chief support. His plays were well received by the actors of the Comédie Française, but were rarely successful there.

Marivaux wrote between 30 and 40 plays, the best of which are &quot;La Surprise de l&#x27;amour&quot; (1722), the &quot;Triomphe de Plutus&quot; (1728), &quot;Jeu de l&#x27;amour et du hasard&quot; (1730) (The Game of Love and Chance), &quot;Les Fausses confidences&quot; (1737), all produced at the Italian theatre, and &quot;Le Legs&quot; (1736), produced at the French. At intervals, he returned to journalism: a periodical publication called &quot;L&#x27;Indigent philosophe&quot; appeared in 1727, and another called &quot;Le Cabinet du philosophe&quot; in 1734. But the same causes which had proved fatal to the &quot;Spectateur&quot; prevented these later efforts from succeeding.

In 1731 Marivaux published the first two parts of his great novel, &quot;Marianne&quot;. The eleven parts appeared at intervals over the next eleven years, but the novel was never finished. In 1735 another novel, &quot;Le Paysan parvenu&quot;, was begun, but this also was left unfinished. Marivaux was elected a member of the Académie française in 1742. For the next twenty years, he contributed occasionally to the &quot;Mercure&quot;, wrote plays and reflections (which were seldom of much worth), and so forth. He died on 12 February 1763, aged seventy-five.

==&quot;Marivaudage&quot;==
The so-called &quot;marivaudage&quot; is the main point of importance about Marivaux&#x27;s literary work, though the best of the comedies have great merits, and &quot;Marianne&quot; is an extremely important step in the development of the French novel. That, and &quot;Le Paysan parvenu&quot;, have some connection to the work of Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding. In general, Marivaux&#x27;s subject matter is the so-called &quot;metaphysic of love-making.&quot; As Claude Prosper Jolyot Crébillon said, Marivaux&#x27;s characters not only tell each other and the reader everything they have thought, but everything that they would like to persuade themselves that they have thought.

This style derives mainly from Fontenelle and the &quot;Précieuses&quot;, though there are traces of it even in Jean de La Bruyère. It abuses metaphor somewhat, and delights to turn a metaphor in an unexpected and bizarre fashion. Sometimes a familiar phrase is used where dignified language would be expected; sometimes the reverse. Crébillon also described Marivaux&#x27;s style as an introduction of words to each other which have never made acquaintance and which think that they will not get on together (this phrase is itself rather Marivaux-esque). This kind of writing, of course, recurs at several periods of literature, especially at the end of the 19th century. This fantastic embroidery of language has a certain charm, and suits the somewhat unreal gallantry and sensibility which it describes and exhibits. Marivaux possessed, moreover, both thought and observation, besides considerable command of pathos.

Marivaux&#x27;s play &quot;The Triumph of Love&quot; (1732) was filmed in English in 2001 as &quot;The Triumph of Love&quot;, starring Mira Sorvino, Ben Kingsley, and Fiona Shaw. It is, so far, the only one of Marivaux&#x27;s plays ever to be filmed in English. The film received modestly favourable reviews, but was not a box office success.

In the French film &quot;L&#x27;Esquive&quot; (2003), directed by Abdellatif Kechiche, Arab-French adolescents in a Paris suburb prepare and perform Marivaux&#x27;s play &quot;Le Jeu de l&#x27;amour et du hasard&quot;.

== History ==



=== Early 20th century (1911–1949) ===

Tsinghua University was established in Beijing during a tumultuous period of national upheaval and conflicts with foreign powers which culminated in the Boxer Rebellion, an uprising against foreign influence in China. After the suppression of the revolt by a foreign alliance including the United States, the ruling Qing dynasty was required to pay indemnities to alliance members. United States Secretary of State John Hay suggested that the US$30 million Boxer indemnity allotted to the United States was excessive. After much negotiation with Qing ambassador Liang Cheng, president of the United States Theodore Roosevelt obtained approval from the United States Congress in 1909 to reduce the indemnity payment by US$10.8 million, on the condition that the funds would be used as scholarships for Chinese students to study in the United States.

Using this fund, the Tsinghua College () was established in Beijing, on 29 April 1911 on the site of a former royal garden to serve as a preparatory school for students the government planned to send to the United States. Faculty members for sciences were recruited by the YMCA from the United States, and its graduates transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation. The motto of Tsinghua, &quot;Self-Discipline and Social Commitment&quot;, was derived from a 1914 speech by prominent scholar and faculty member Liang Qichao, in which he quoted the I Ching to describe a notion of the ideal gentleman.

In 1925, the school established its own four-year undergraduate program and started a research institute on Chinese studies. In 1928, the school changed its name to National Tsinghua University.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, many Chinese universities were forced to evacuate their campuses to avoid the Japanese invasion. In 1937, Tsinghua University, Peking University and Nankai University merged to form the Changsha Temporary University, located in Changsha, Hunan. The merged university later became the National Southwestern Associated University, located in Kunming, Yunnan. The Tsinghua University section of the merged university returned to Beijing at the end of World War II.

=== Later 20th century (post-1949) ===
After the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, China experienced a communist revolution leading to the creation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Tsinghua University&#x27;s then president Mei Yiqi, along with many professors, fled to Taiwan with the retreating Nationalist government. They established the National Tsing Hua Institute of Nuclear Technology in 1955, which later became the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, an institution independent and distinct from Tsinghua University.

In 1952, the Chinese Communist Party regrouped the country&#x27;s higher education institutions in an attempt to build a Soviet style system where each institution specialized in a certain field of study, such as social sciences or natural sciences. Tsinghua University was streamlined into a polytechnic institute with a focus on engineering and the natural sciences.

In 1953, Tsinghua established a political counselor program, becoming the first university to do so following the Ministry of Education&#x27;s 1952 directive to begin piloting such programs. As political counselors, new graduates who were also Communist Party members worked as political counselors in managing the student body and student organizations, often simultaneously serving as Communist Youth League secretaries. The program was later expanded to other universities following its endorsement by Deng Xiaoping and became further institutionalized across China in the 1990s and 2000s.

During the Third Front construction, Tsinghua established a branch in Mianyang, Sichuan province.

In 1966, the efforts of Tsinghua researchers were critical in China&#x27;s transition from vacuum-tube computers to fully transistorized computers.

From 1966 to 1976, China experienced immense sociopolitical upheaval and instability during the Cultural Revolution. Many university students walked out of classrooms at Tsinghua and other institutions, and some went on to join the Red Guards, resulting in the complete shutdown of the university as faculty were persecuted or otherwise unable to teach. It was not until 1978, after the Cultural Revolution ended, that the university began to take in students and re-emerge as a force in Chinese politics and society.

During the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign of 1973 to 1976, critique groups formed at Tsinghua and Peking University disseminated commentaries under the pseudonym of &quot;Liang Xiao&quot;. The pseudonym sounds like a person&#x27;s name but is a homophone for &quot;two schools&quot;.

In the 1980s, Tsinghua evolved beyond the polytechnic model and incorporated a multidisciplinary system emphasizing collaboration between distinct schools within the broader university environment. Under this system, several schools have been re-incorporated, including Tsinghua Law School, the School of Economics and Management, the School of Sciences, the School of Life Sciences, the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, the School of Public Policy and Management, and the Academy of Arts and Design.

In 1996, the School of Economics and Management established a partnership with the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One year later, Tsinghua and MIT began the MBA program known as the Tsinghua-MIT Global MBA.

In 1998, Tsinghua became the first Chinese university to offer a Master of Laws (LLM) program in American law, through a cooperative venture with the Temple University Beasley School of Law.

=== 21st century ===
Tsinghua alumni include the current General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and paramount leader of China, Xi Jinping &#x27;79, who graduated with a degree in chemical engineering, along with the CCP General Secretary and former Paramount Leader of China Hu Jintao &#x27;64, who graduated with a degree in hydraulic engineering. In addition to its powerful alumni, Tsinghua has a reputation for hosting globally prominent guest speakers, with international leaders Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Henry Kissinger, Carlos Ghosn, and Henry Paulson having lectured to the university community.

As of 2018, Tsinghua University consists of 20 schools and 58 university departments, 41 research institutes, 35 research centers, and 167 laboratories, including 15 national key laboratories. In September 2006, the Peking Union Medical College, a renowned medical school, was renamed &quot;Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University&quot; although it and Tsinghua University are technically separate institutions. The university operates the Tsinghua University Press, which publishes academic journals, textbooks, and other scholarly works.Through its constituent colleges, graduate and professional schools, and other institutes, Tsinghua University offers more than 82 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 80 master&#x27;s degree programs and 90 PhD programs.

In 2014, Tsinghua established Xinya College, a residential liberal arts college, as a pilot project to reform undergraduate education at the university. Modeled after universities in the United States and Europe, Xinya combines general and professional education in a liberal arts tradition, featuring a core curriculum of Chinese and Western literature and civilization studies and required courses in physical education and foreign languages. Furthermore, while most Tsinghua undergraduates must choose a specific major upon entrance, Xinya students declare their majors at the end of freshman year, enabling them to explore several different fields of study.

In December 2014, Tsinghua University established the Advisory Committee of Undergraduate Curriculum (ACUC). It became the first student autonomous organization in mainland China for students to participate in the school&#x27;s management. The Tsinghua University Academic Committee, which was formally established on 8 July 2015, has stipulated in the committee&#x27;s charter that students should be consulted through the ACUC for resolutions involving undergraduate students. From then on, Tsinghua commenced a new round of academic reform lasting ever since, including establishing GPA grading system, adding the writing classes, critical thinking classes, second foreign languages classes into curriculum, requiring undergrads to be able to swim before graduation, cooperating with the Peking University on class cross-registration to supplement each other&#x27;s general education curriculum, reducing fees on class withdraw, transcripts and certificates, and adjusting the graduate school co-terminal admission policies.

In 2016, Schwarzman Scholars was established with almost US$400 million endowment by Steven Schwarzman, the chairman and CEO of the Blackstone Group and other multinational corporations and global leaders. Schwarzman Scholars annually selects 100–200 scholars across the world to enroll in a one-year fully-funded master&#x27;s degree leadership program designed to cultivate the next generation of global leaders. 40% students are selected from the United States, 20% students are selected from China, 40% are selected from rest of the world. These scholars reside on the university campus at Schwarzman College, a residential college built specifically for the program.

In 2016, Tsinghua&#x27;s expenditures were RMB 13.7 billion (US$3.57 billion at purchasing power parity), the largest budget of any university in China. According to a 2018 &quot;Financial Times&quot; report, Tsinghua University has been linked to cyber-espionage.

In 2024, Tsinghua announced that its office of the university president had merged into the university&#x27;s Chinese Communist Party committee, which would directly administer the university henceforth.

==Academics==
Tsinghua University engages in extensive research and offers 51 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 139 master&#x27;s degree programs, and 107 doctoral programs through 20 colleges and 57 departments covering a broad range of subjects, including science, engineering, arts and literature, social sciences, law, medicine. Along with its membership in the C9 League, Tsinghua University affiliations include the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, a group of 50 leading Asian and American universities, Washington University in St. Louis&#x27;s McDonnell International Scholars Academy, a group of 35 premier global universities, and the Association of East Asian Research Universities, a 17-member research collaboration network of top regional institutions. Tsinghua is an associate member of the Consortium Linking Universities of Science and Technology for Education and Research (CLUSTER). Tsinghua is a member of a Low Carbon Energy University Alliance (LCEUA), together with the University of Cambridge and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

===Admissions===
Admission to Tsinghua for both undergraduate and graduate schools is extremely competitive. Undergraduate admissions for domestic students is decided through the gaokao, the Chinese national college entrance exam, which allows students to list Tsinghua University among their preferred college choices. While selectivity varies by province, the sheer number of high school students applying for college each year has resulted in overall acceptance rates far lower than 0.1% of all test takers.

Admission to Tsinghua&#x27;s graduate schools is also very competitive. Only about 16% of MBA applicants are admitted each year.

===Research===
Research at Tsinghua University is mainly supported by government funding from national programs and special projects. In the areas of science and technology, funding from these sources totals over 20 billion yuan, which subsidizes more than 1,400 projects every year conducted by the university. With the prospective increase of state investment in science and technology, research at Tsinghua is projected to receive more financial support from the state.

In 2007, Tsinghua was granted security clearance to conduct classified research of military interest.

Each year, the university hosts the Intellectual Property Summer Institute in cooperation with Franklin Pierce Law Center of Concord, New Hampshire.

The scientific research institutions in Tsinghua University are divided into three categories, including government-approved institutions, institutions independently established by the university and institutions jointly established by the university and independent legal entities outside the university.

As of 31 December 2022, Tsinghua University has 428 university-level scientific research institutions in operation.

=== School of Life Sciences ===
School of Life Sciences was first established in 1926 under the name Department of Biology. Botanist Qian Chongshu took up the first dean.
During the nationwide reorganization of universities in the early 1950s, the Department of Biology was merged into other universities, namely Peking University etc., resulting in a vacancy in the field of biological research in Tsinghua for almost 30 years.

In June 1984, decisions were made about the reestablishment of the Department of Biology, and the department officially reopened in September. During the reestablishment the Department of Biology of Peking University, the Institute of Biophysics of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and many other institutes as well as biologists provided valuable support and help. The department changed its name to the current name in September 2009. As of 2013, structural biologist and foreign associate of National Academy of Sciences of United States Dr. Wang Hongwei (王宏伟) is the current dean of School of Life Sciences. The school currently has 129 professors and employees, around 600 undergraduates (including the candidates of Tsinghua University – Peking Union Medical College joint MD program).

===Peking Union Medical College===

The Peking Union Medical College was established in 1917 by the Rockefeller Foundation and was modeled on the US medical education system. Tsinghua first established its medical school in 2001 and in 2006, Tsinghua&#x27;s medical school merged with the Peking Union Medical College renaming it &quot;Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University&quot;. The school remains the top ranked medical school and general hospital in China according to CUCAS in 2015. The Peking Union Medical College is also the only medical school to be affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. It runs one of the most competitive medical programs in the country, accepting 90 students a year into its 8-year MD program. Students in the 8-year program spend 2.5 years at Tsinghua studying premedical education before moving onto Peking Union Medical College to complete the last 5.5 years in clinical medicine, basic medical education and research.

=== School of Economics and Management ===

The School of Economics and Management dates back to 1926, when Tsinghua University established its Faculty of Economics.

===School of Journalism and Communication===
The Tsinghua School of Journalism and Communication (TSJC) was established in April 2002. Its predecessor was Communication Studies in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature and its establishment of coincides with the development of media increasingly influencing world affairs in a time of fast-growing globalization. The school&#x27;s research fields include International Communication, Film and Television Studies, New Media Studies, Media Operation and Management, and Business Journalism and are based on comprehensive academic research in journalism and communication theories. The objective of the school is to bring full advantage of Tsinghua University&#x27;s comprehensive academic structure to Chinese and international media, to construct a first-rate discipline in journalism and communication studies, to cultivate talented professionals in the field and to explore advanced concepts in journalism and communication. The school also offers a two-year graduate program in international business journalism, sponsored by Bloomberg L.P. and the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), that trains talented students and media professionals from around the globe in financial media and corporate communication.

The school has five research-oriented centers to organize and conduct academic research activities. They are: Center for International Communications Studies, Center for New Media Studies, Center for Film and Television Studies, Center for Media Management Studies and Center for Cultural Industry Studies.

=== School of Law ===
The legal studies at Tsinghua University can be dated back to the &quot;Tsinghua College&quot; era (1911–1929), where many students were sent to universities in western countries for legal studies. Graduating from institutions such as Columbia, Yale, and Harvard, those Tsinghua alumni have played an important role in areas of law and diplomacy. Famous legal scholars Tuan-Sheng Ch&#x27;ien, Yan Shutang (燕树棠), Wang Huacheng (王化成), Kung Chuan Hsiao (萧公权), Pu Xuefeng (浦薛凤), Mei Ju&#x27;ao (梅汝璈), Xiang Zhejun (向哲浚) and diplomat Tang Yueliang (唐悦良) are all graduates from Tsinghua College or went to study abroad after passing exams in Tsinghua College.

Tsinghua University School of Law was established in 1929 after Tsinghua College was renamed Tsinghua University. Legal education in Tsinghua University at the time focused on international affairs and Chinese legal studies. Courses on political science and economics could also be found on students&#x27; curriculum. Before the Japanese army invaded Beijing in 1937, the School of Law developed greatly. Many Chinese legal scholars graduated during that era, including Wang Tieya (王铁崖), Gong Xiangrui (龚祥瑞) and Lou Bangyan (楼邦彦).

In 1952, in response to the government policy of turning Tsinghua University into an engineering-focused university, the law school was dismissed; the faculty were appointed to other universities, including Peking University and Peking College of Political Science and Law (the predecessor of China University of Political Science and Law). Until 1995, there was no formal &quot;school of law&quot; at Tsinghua University, yet courses on law were still taught in Tsinghua University from the early 1980s.

On 8 September 1995, the Tsinghua University Department of Law was formally re-established; on 25 April 1999, the 88th anniversary of Tsinghua University, the university formally changed the department into the &quot;School of Law&quot;. The &quot;new&quot; law school inherited the spirit of the &quot;old&quot; law school and has endeavored to add international factors to its students&#x27; curriculum. Due to its outstanding faculty members and students, the Tsinghua University School of Law has risen to become one of the leading law schools in China and since 2011, has been consistently ranked as the best or the second-best law school in mainland China by QS World University Rankings.

=== Graduate School at Shenzhen ===
The Graduate School at Shenzhen was jointly founded by Tsinghua University and the Shenzhen Municipal Government. The school is directly affiliated with Tsinghua University in Beijing. The campus is located in the University Town of Shenzhen since 18 October 2003.

<text>Fudan University (FDU) is a national public university in Yangpu, Shanghai, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education and is co-funded with the Shanghai Municipal Government. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction. 

The university was originally founded by the Chinese Jesuit priest Ma Xiangbo in 1905. It is a member of the C9 League.

== History ==

=== 1905–1917: college-preparatory school ===
The university traces its origins to Fudan College, established in 1905 by Chinese Jesuit priest Ma Xiangbo. Prior to founding Fudan, Ma had established Aurora College, where the Society of Jesus frequently opposed and intervened in student movements. This led Ma to create a new institution, Fudan College, as a preparatory school for higher education with government funding, offering three-year education for general or specialised tracks. After the 1911 revolution, Fudan continued to offer general rather than specialised education.

=== 1917–1941: private university ===
Fudan became a private university in 1917, establishing specialised departments including Chinese literature, foreign literature, banking, business and administration, economics, politics, civil engineering and psychology. In 1921, university preparatory education was ended and the university began to adopt an American-styled credit and elective system, per a national policy. In 1928, Fudan was registered with the Ministry of Education of the newly founded Nationalist government. In 1929, the university was organised into four faculties, namely Liberal Arts, Science, Law and Commerce. In 1937, it moved to Chongqing due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War.

=== 1941–1949: national university ===
In 1941, with the approval from the Nationalist government, the university was transformed from a private university to a national university, which allowed the government to control Fudan&#x27;s major posts, including the president, provost and dean. In early 1946, the university returned to Shanghai. In China under Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang, Fudan University was tasked with providing a Western-style education to Chinese students to support the country&#x27;s economic reconstruction efforts.

=== 1949–1976: Mao Zedong era ===
In 1949, the university was taken over by the Shanghai Military Control Commission of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), as the CCP defeated the Kuomintang in the Chinese civil war. By 1952, the CCP remodelled the Chinese higher education based on the Soviet model, leading to the inclusion of Communist ideology in Fudan&#x27;s educational offerings. Fudan was transformed into a Soviet-style comprehensive university, with departments of arts and science of other universities merged into Fudan, leaving Fudan the only university to provide basic science and arts in Shanghai. In China under Mao Zedong, Fudan University was tasked with transmitting socialist values to further the agenda of the CCP. During the Cultural Revolution, the teaching at Fudan was completed halted due to political turmoils.

=== 1976 to present ===
In 2000, Fudan University merged with Shanghai Medical University, which was founded as the Fourth National Chungshan University School of Medicine in 1927, to form the new Fudan University.

In December 2019, Fudan University changed its constitution, removing the phrase &quot;academic independence and freedom of thought&quot; (學術獨立和思想自由) and including a &quot;pledge to follow the Communist party&#x27;s leadership&quot; (學校堅持中國共產黨的領導), leading to protests among the students. It also said that Fudan University had to &quot;equip its teachers and employees&quot; with &quot;Xi Jinping Thought&quot;, leading to concerns about the diminishing academic freedom of Fudan.

The university set up a 1 billion yuan fund of funds for start up innovation in 2023 as well as launching what it claims to be China’s largest cloud-based scientific research computing platform CFFF.

The Hungarian government made an agreement to open the first campus of Fudan University outside China in Budapest in 2024. The expansion would cost 540 billion HUF, of which 450 billion would be paid by the Hungarian state from a Chinese loan. The construction would be mainly done by Chinese companies. Hungarian education professionals and politicians denounced the investment, citing economics, higher education and national security concerns.

==Campus ==
Fudan has five undergraduate colleges – Zhide (), Tengfei (), Keqing (), Renzhong (), and Xide (). 

The university has four campuses in Shanghai – Handan (), Fenglin (), Zhangjiang (), and Jiangwan () – which share the same central administration. It also has 17 affiliated hospitals. 

==Academic profile==
===International links===
 Fudan has joint MBA programs in the School of Management with MIT Sloan School of Management in the US (since 1996, leading to a Fudan degree), BI Norwegian Business School in Norway (since 1996, leading to a BI Norwegian Business School degree), and the University of Hong Kong in Hong Kong (leading to a University of Hong Kong degree), Washington University in the US (leading to a Washington University degree). There are also a double degree in international management with Bocconi University and Luiss University in Italy (since 2005, leading to a master&#x27;s in international management from one of the Italian universities), an executive MBA with National Taiwan University, and a global master&#x27;s in management with London Business School (leading to degrees from both institutions).

Fudan University School of Economics has had a partnership with Durham University Business School in England to deliver a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) degree awarded by Durham University since 2006, with the first students starting in 2007. Fudan remains the main location, but some elements of the course are also delivered at Durham and in San Francisco, USA.

Fudan, Korea University Business School in Korea, and the National University of Singapore in Singapore have collaborated on the S3 Asia MBA since 2008, with students spending six months at each of the institutions. Fudan students receive a dual degree from Fudan and one of the other universities in the collaboration.

<doc id="72622" wikidata="Q8444" url="?curid=72622" title="1976 Summer Olympics">
<text>The 1976 Summer Olympics (), officially known as the Games of the XXI Olympiad () and officially branded as Montreal 1976 (), were an international multi-sport event held from July 17 to August 1, 1976, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Montreal was awarded the rights to the 1976 Games at the 69th IOC Session in Amsterdam on May 12, 1970, over the bids of Moscow and Los Angeles. It is the only Summer Olympic Games to be held in Canada. Toronto hosted the 1976 Summer Paralympics the same year as the Montreal Olympics, also the only Summer Paralympics to be held in Canada. Calgary and Vancouver later hosted the Winter Olympic Games in 1988 and 2010, respectively. This was the first of two consecutive Olympic games held in North America, followed by the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid.

Twenty-nine countries, mostly African, boycotted the Montreal Games when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused to ban New Zealand, after the New Zealand national rugby union team had toured South Africa earlier in 1976 in defiance of the United Nations&#x27; calls for a sporting embargo due to their racist apartheid policies. The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals, with the Eastern Bloc having seven countries in the top 10 of the medal table.

==Host city selection==
The vote occurred at the 69th IOC Session in Amsterdam, Netherlands on May 12, 1970. While Los Angeles and Moscow were viewed as the favourites, given that they represented the world&#x27;s two main powers, many of the smaller and neutral countries supported Montreal as an underdog and as a relatively neutral site for the Games. Los Angeles was eliminated after the first round, and Montreal won over Moscow in the second round. Moscow and Los Angeles would go on to host the next two Summer Games, 1980 and 1984 Summer Olympics, respectively, which were also marked by political boycotts (for instance, the U.S.-led boycott of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979). One blank vote was cast in the second and final round. The Soviet state media accused the IOC of political corruption following the vote.

Toronto had made its third attempt for the Olympics, but failed to win the support of the Canadian Olympic Committee, which selected Montreal instead.

==Organization==

Robert Bourassa, then the Premier of Quebec, asked Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to advise Canada&#x27;s monarch Elizabeth II to attend the opening of the games. However, Bourassa later became unsettled about how unpopular the move might be with sovereigntists in the province, annoying Trudeau, who had already made arrangements. René Lévesque, the leader of the Parti Québécois at the time, sent his own letter to Buckingham Palace, asking the Queen to refuse her prime minister&#x27;s request, but she did not oblige Lévesque as he was out of his jurisdiction in offering advice to the Sovereign.

In 1976, Trudeau, succumbing to pressure from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, issued an order barring Taiwan from participating as China in the 1976 Montreal Olympics, although it was technically a matter for the IOC. His action strained relations with the United States – from President Ford to future President Carter and the press. Trudeau&#x27;s action was widely condemned as having brought shame on Canada by succumbing to political pressure to keep the Chinese delegation from competing under its name.

===Mascot===

The mascot was a beaver named Amik, whose name was chosen after a national competition.

==Cost and cost overrun==
The &quot;Oxford Olympics Study&quot; estimates the outturn cost of the Montreal 1976 Summer Olympics at US$6.1 billion in 2015 dollars and cost overrun at 720% in real terms. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, &quot;operational costs&quot; incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and &quot;direct capital costs&quot; incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast centre, and media and press centre, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are &quot;not&quot; included, such as those for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost overrun for Montreal 1976 is the highest cost overrun on record for any Olympics. The cost and cost overrun for Montreal 1976 compares with costs of US$4.6 billion and a cost overrun of 51% for Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and $15 billion and 76% for London in 2012. The average cost for the Summer Games from 1960 to 2016 was $5.2 billion in 2015 dollars, and the average cost overrun was 176%.

Much of the cost overruns were caused by the &quot;Conseil des métiers de la construction&quot; union, whose leader was André &quot;Dede&quot; Desjardins. French architect Roger Taillibert, who designed the Olympic stadium, recounted in his 2000 book &quot;Notre Cher Stade Olympique&quot; that he and Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau tried hard to buy off Desjardins, even taking him to a lunch at the exclusive Ritz-Carlton hotel in a vain attempt to end the &quot;delays&quot;. Ultimately Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa made a secret deal to buy off Desjardins, which finally allowed work to proceed. Taillibert wrote in &quot;Notre Cher Stade Olympique&quot; &quot;If the Olympic Games took place, it was thanks to Dede Desjardins. What irony!&quot;

== Opening ceremony ==


The opening ceremony of the 1976 Summer Olympic Games was held at the incomplete Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Quebec on Saturday afternoon, July 17, 1976, in front of an audience of some 73,000 in the stadium and an estimated half billion watching on television.

Following an air show by the Canadian Forces Air Command&#x27;s Snowbirds aerobatic flight demonstration squadron in the sunny skies above the stadium, the ceremony officially began at 3:00 pm with a trumpet fanfare and the arrival of Elizabeth II, as Queen of Canada. The Queen was accompanied by Michael Morris, Lord Killanin, President of the International Olympic Committee, and was greeted to an orchestral rendition of &#x27;O Canada&#x27;, an arrangement that would be used for many years in schools across the country, as well as in the daily sign-off of TV broadcasts in the country.

The queen entered the Royal Box with her consort, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and her son, Prince Andrew. (Her daughter, Princess Anne, was an equestrian competing at Great Britain equestrian team. Prince Philip was also president of the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) at the time of the 1976 Summer Olympics.) She joined a number of Canadian and Olympic dignitaries, including: Jules Léger, Governor General of Canada, and his wife, Gabrielle; Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and wife, Margaret; Robert Bourassa, Premier of the province of Quebec; Roger Rousseau, chief of the Montreal Olympic Organizing Committee (COJOM); Sheila Dunlop, Lady Killanin, wife of the IOC President; Mayor of Montreal, Jean Drapeau, and his wife, Marie-Claire.

The parade of athletes began moments later with the arrival of the Greek team, and concluded with the entrance of the Canadian team. All other teams entered the stadium according to French alphabetical order (as the host city main language). The ceremony was marked by the adorning of Israel&#x27;s flag with a black mourning ribbon, in memory of the eleven athletes and coaches killed by Palestinian terrorists at the previous Summer Olympic Games in Munich four years earlier. Although most would eventually boycott the Games in the days to follow, a number of African delegations did march in the parade. Much of the music performed for the parade was arranged by Victor Vogel and was inspired by late Quebecois composer André Mathieu.

Immediately following the parade, a troupe of 80 women dancers dressed in white (representing the 80th anniversary of the revival of the Olympic Games) performed a brief dance in the outline of the Olympic rings. Following that came the official speeches, first by Roger Rousseau, head of the Montreal Olympic organizing committee, and Lord Killanin. Her Majesty was then invited to proclaim the Games open, which she did, first in French, then in English.

Accompanied by the Olympic Hymn, the Olympic flag was carried into the stadium and hoisted at the west end of the stadium. The flag was carried by eight men and hoisted by four women, representing the ten provinces and two territories (at the time) of Canada. As the flag was hoisted, an all-male choir performed an a cappella version of the Olympic Hymn.

Once the flag was hosted, a troupe of Bavarian dancers representing Munich, host of the previous Summer Olympics, entered the stadium with the Antwerp flag. Following a brief dance, that flag was then passed from the Mayor of Munich to the IOC President and then to the Mayor of Montreal. Next came a presentation of traditional Québécois folk dancers. The two troupes merged in dance together to the strains of &quot;Vive le Compagnie&quot; and exited the stadium with the Antwerp Flag, which would be displayed at Montreal City Hall until the opening of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Three cannons were then fired, as the 80-member troupe of female dancers unfolded special crates that released doves and ribbons in the five Olympic colours.

Another trumpet fanfare announced the arrival of the Olympic Flame. The torch was carried by 15-year-olds Stéphane Préfontaine and Sandra Henderson, chosen as representatives of the unity within Canada&#x27;s linguistic heritage. This would also be the first time two people would light the Olympic flame, and Henderson would become only the second woman to do the honours. The duo would make a lap of the stadium and then climbed a staircase on a special dais at the centre of the stadium to set the Olympic flame alight in a temporary white aluminum cauldron. The flame was later transported to a more permanent cauldron just outside the running track to burn throughout the duration of the Games. A choir then performed the Olympic Cantata as onlookers admired the Olympic flame.

The &quot;Youth of Canada&quot; took to the track to perform a colourful choreographed segment with flags, ribbons and a variety of rhythmic gymnast performers. The flag bearers of each team then circled around the speaker&#x27;s dais as Pierre St-Jean recited the Athletes&#x27; Oath and Maurice Forget recited the Judges&#x27; Oath, in English and in French, with right hand over the heart and the Canadian flag clutched in the left. Finally, a choral performance of &quot;O Canada&quot; in both French and English marked the close of the opening ceremony, as the announcers concluded with a declaration of the Games motto: &#x27;Vive les Jeux de Montreal! Long Live the Montreal Games&#x27;.

The Montreal ceremony would be the first of its kind in Summer Games, as future Olympic ceremonies, beginning with the new Olympic Charter were reinforced before the 1980 Summer Olympics, would become more focused on the host country culture.

== Security ==
Because of the Munich massacre, security at these games was visible. The extensive security measures included the requirement for all workers to hold a valid accreditation. Surveillance of acoustics was installed in the Olympic Village where athletes were accommodated. Furthermore, a systematic installation of closed-circuit television (CCTV) was attempted for the first time in the history of the Olympic games.

== Highlights ==
* These Olympics were the first of two summer games to be organized under the IOC presidency of Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin.
* Taro Aso was a member of the Japanese shooting team. 32 years later, he would be elected as the Prime Minister of Japan.
* The Games were opened by Elizabeth II, as head of state of Canada, and several members of the Royal Family attended the opening ceremonies. This was particularly significant, as these were the first Olympic games hosted on Canadian soil. The Queen&#x27;s daughter, Princess Anne, also competed in the games as part of the British riding team. Additionally, the Queen&#x27;s husband, Prince Philip, was President of the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) at the time.
* After a rainstorm doused the Olympic Flame a few days after the games had opened, an official relit the flame using his cigarette lighter. Organizers quickly doused it again and relit it using a backup of the original flame.
* The Israeli team walked into the stadium at the opening ceremony wearing black ribbons in commemoration of the 1972 Munich massacre.
* Women&#x27;s events were introduced in basketball, handball, and rowing.
* Canada, the host country, finished with five silver and six bronze medals. This was the first time that the host country of the Summer Games had not won any gold medals. This had occurred previously only in the Winter Games – 1924 in Chamonix, France, and 1928 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. This later occurred at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, and again at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
* Because of the Munich massacre, security at these games was visible, as it had been earlier in the year at the Winter Games in Innsbruck, Austria.
* At age 14, gymnast Nadia Comăneci of Romania became the first person to score a perfect 10 at the Olympics, recording seven 10.00 scores and winning three gold medals, including the all-around. The scoreboard could hold only 3 digits and the score was shown as 1.00. 
* Alberto Juantorena of Cuba became the first man to win both the 400 m and 800 m at the same Olympics.
* Finland&#x27;s Lasse Virén repeated his 1972 double win in the 5,000 and 10,000 m runs, the first runner to successfully defend a 5,000 m win (since equalled by Great Britain&#x27;s Mo Farah in 2016). Virén finished 5th in the marathon, thereby failing to equal Emil Zátopek&#x27;s 1952 achievements.
* Hasely Crawford won Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s first Olympic gold medal by finishing first in the 100 meter dash.
* Viktor Saneyev of the Soviet Union won his third consecutive triple jump gold medal, while Klaus Dibiasi of Italy did the same in the platform diving event.
* Boris Onishchenko, a member of the Soviet Union&#x27;s modern pentathlon team, was disqualified after it was discovered that he had rigged his épée to register a hit when there was not one. Because of this, the Soviet modern pentathlon team was disqualified. Due to his disqualification, he earned the nickname &quot;Boris DISonish-chenko&quot;. Many suggested that he was a victim of the Soviet &quot;win it all&quot; mentality.
* Five American boxers – Sugar Ray Leonard, Leon Spinks, Michael Spinks, Leo Randolph and Howard Davis Jr. won gold medals in boxing. This has been often called the greatest Olympic boxing team the United States ever had, and, out of the five American gold medalists in boxing, all but Davis went on to become professional world champions.
* Princess Anne of Great Britain was the only female competitor not to have to submit to a sex test. She was a member of her country&#x27;s equestrian team.
* Japanese gymnast Shun Fujimoto performed on a broken right knee, and helped the Japanese team win the gold medal for the team championship. Fujimoto broke his leg on the floor exercise, and due to the closeness in the overall standings with the USSR, he hid the extent of the injury. With a broken knee, Fujimoto was able to complete his event on the rings, performing a perfect triple somersault dismount, maintaining perfect posture. He scored a 9.7 thus securing gold for Japan. Years later, when asked if he would do it again, he stated bluntly &quot;No, I would not.&quot;
* The U.S. men&#x27;s swimming team won all but one gold medal. John Naber won four gold medals and a silver medal.
* The East German women&#x27;s swimming team won all but two gold medals. Kornelia Ender won four gold medals and a silver medal.
* In winning the gold medal for the men&#x27;s 100m freestyle, Jim Montgomery became the first person to break the 50 second mark in the event, taking first place in the final in a time of 49.99.
* For the first time ever, a woman won an Olympic medal in shooting: American Margaret Murdock caught the silver in the three positions event. Lanny Bassham (another American) and Murdock tied for the first place, but Murdock was placed second after review of the targets. Bassham suggested that two gold medals be given, and after this request was declined, asked Murdock to share the top step with him at the award ceremony. At that time, all the shooting sport events were mixed. Murdock became the first woman to win an Olympic medal in shooting.
* Luann Ryon won the women&#x27;s Archery gold for the United States; Ryon had never before competed at the international level.
* Bruce Jenner won the gold medal for decathlon, setting a world record of 8,634 points.
* Greg Louganis won the silver medal for the 10m Platform event in Men&#x27;s Diving at 16 years old.
* Alex Oakley, the Canadian race walker, became the oldest track and field athlete to compete at the Olympic Games. He was aged 50, and taking part in his fifth Olympics.
* The New Zealand men&#x27;s national field hockey team beat Australia to win gold, becoming the first non-Asian/European team to win the gold medal in hockey. It is also the first Olympic games in which hockey was played on artificial turf.
* The Polish men&#x27;s volleyball team came back from being down 2 sets against the USSR to win the gold medal.
* Twenty-year-old Morehouse College student Edwin Moses sets a new world record in the 400m hurdles, less than a year after taking up the event. He is also America&#x27;s only male individual track gold medalist.
* Thomas Bach of West Germany won a gold medal in the team foil event in fencing. He would later become IOC President.
* Heavyweight boxer Clarence Hill won a bronze medal for Bermuda. His accomplishment makes Bermuda the smallest nation in terms of population to win an Olympic medal at the Summer Olympics.
*East Germany surpassed all expectations for a middle-sized nation by finishing with the second most gold medals in total. The East German women&#x27;s swimming team won all but two gold medals. Swimmer Kornelia Ender won four gold medals and a silver medal. However, the GDR&#x27;s achievements were later fundamentally undermined by the exposure of a serious and systematic scheme of doping by the East German sporting authorities. It was later revealed that after injecting athletes with performance-boosting drugs at the Montreal Olympics, East German officials dumped the leftover serum and syringes in the Saint Lawrence River.

== Sports ==

There was a desire by the IOC&#x27;s program commission to reduce the number of competitors and a number of recommendations were put to the IOC&#x27;s executive board on February 23, 1973, which were all accepted. Rowing was the only sport where the number of competitors was increased, and women were admitted for the first time in Olympic history. The 1976 Summer Olympic program featured 196 events with 198 medal ceremonies in the following 21 sports:
*Aquatics
**
*
*
*
**Road 
**Track 
**Dressage 
**Eventing 
**Show jumping

== Participating National Olympic Committees ==
Four nations made their first Summer Olympic appearance in Montreal: Andorra (which had its overall Olympic debut a few months before in Innsbruck Winter Olympics), Antigua and Barbuda (as &quot;Antigua&quot;), Cayman Islands, and Papua New Guinea.

Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of athletes from each nation that competed at the Games.

==Calendar==

==Medal count==
These are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1976 Games. Canada placed 27th with only 11 medals in total, none of them being gold. Canada remains the only host nation of a Summer Olympics to fail to win at least one gold medal. It also did not win any gold medals at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. However, Canada went on to win the most gold medals at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

The Games were dominated by the Soviet Bloc, with the USSR and its satellites occupying seven out of top ten places in the medal standings.

== Non-participating National Olympic Committees ==
Twenty-nine countries boycotted the Games due to the refusal of the IOC to ban New Zealand, after the New Zealand national rugby union team had toured South Africa earlier in 1976. The boycott was led by Congolese official Jean-Claude Ganga. Some of the boycotting nations (including Morocco, Cameroon and Egypt) had already participated, however, and withdrew after the first few days. Senegal and Ivory Coast were the only African countries that competed throughout the duration of the Games. Elsewhere, Afghanistan, Albania, Burma, Iraq, Guyana, Sri Lanka and Syria also opted to join the Congolese-led boycott. South Africa had been banned from the Olympics since 1964 due to its apartheid policies. Other countries, such as El Salvador and Zaire, did not participate in Montreal for purely economic reasons.

===Republic of China boycott===
An unrelated boycott of the Montreal Games was the main issue between the Republic of China (ROC) and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). The ROC team withdrew from the games when Canada&#x27;s Liberal government under Pierre Trudeau told it that the name &quot;Republic of China&quot; was not permissible at the Games because Canada had officially recognized the PRC in 1970. Canada attempted a compromise by allowing the ROC the continued use of its national flag and anthem in the Montreal Olympic activities; the ROC refused. In 1979 the IOC established in the Nagoya Resolution that the PRC agreed to participate in IOC activities if the Republic of China was referred to as &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;. Another boycott would occur before the ROC would accept the provisions of the 1979 resolution. 
==Doping==
Researchers from Germany in 2013 reported that West Germany had a state-sponsored doping program, and speculated it was in response to doping in East Germany which had existed for decades.

==Television coverage==
ABC Sports paid US$25-million for television broadcast rights in the United States, and produced 76.5 hours of coverage.

CBC Sports budgeted less than CAD$2-million and produced 169 hours of coverage, compared to 14 hours of programming at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The network expanded its coverage in 1976, when convinced there would be increased media interest from Canadians. When the network was criticized for spending taxpayer dollars, executive producer Bob Moir toured the country to explain the project and boasted that, &quot;the biggest team in Montreal will be the CBC team... It will be bigger than the Canadian Olympic team&quot;. CBC Sports had 245 people on its crew, and aired from 9 am until 11 pm daily, taking breaks only for newscasts. Ted Reynolds and Lloyd Robertson co-hosted coverage of the opening ceremonies. In 1976, CBC Sports began its practice of talking live with athletes immediately after events, and built a studio for the interviews. CBC broadcasters were given information kits on the athletes, prepared by Jack Sullivan, the former sports editor of The Canadian Press.

==Legacy==
The legacy of the Montreal Olympics is complex. Many citizens regard the Olympiad as a financial disaster for the city as it faced debts for 30 years after the Games had finished. The retractable roof of the Olympic Stadium never properly worked and on several occasions has torn, prompting the stadium to be closed for extended periods of time for repairs. The failure of the Montreal Expos baseball club is largely blamed on the failure of the Olympic Stadium to transition into an effective and popular venue for the club – given the massive capacity of the stadium, it often looked unimpressive even with regular crowds in excess of 20,000 spectators.

The Quebec provincial government took over construction when it became evident in 1975 that work had fallen far behind schedule. Work was still ongoing just weeks before the opening date, and the tower was not built. Mayor Jean Drapeau had confidently predicted in 1970 that &quot;the Olympics can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby&quot;, but the debt racked up to a billion dollars that the Quebec government mandated the city pay in full. This would prompt cartoonist Aislin to draw a pregnant Drapeau on the telephone saying, &quot;Allo, Morgentaler?&quot; in reference to a Montreal abortion provider.

The Olympic Stadium was designed by French architect Roger Taillibert. It is often nicknamed &quot;The Big O&quot; as a reference to both its name and to the doughnut-shape of the permanent component of the stadium&#x27;s roof, though &quot;The Big Owe&quot; has been used to reference the astronomical cost of the stadium and the 1976 Olympics as a whole. It has never had an effective retractable roof, and the tower (called the Montreal Tower) was completed only eleven years after the Olympic Games, in 1987. In December 2006 the stadium&#x27;s costs were finally paid in full. The total expenditure (including repairs, renovations, construction, interest, and inflation) amounted to C$1.61 billion. Today the stadium lacks a permanent tenant, as the Montreal Alouettes and Montreal Expos have moved, though it does host some individual games of the Alouettes as well as CF Montréal (formerly the Montreal Impact).

One of the streets surrounding the Olympic Stadium was renamed to honour Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the Olympics.

The boycott by African nations over the inclusion of New Zealand, whose rugby team had played in South Africa that year, was a contributing factor in the massive protests and civil disobedience that occurred during the 1981 Springbok Tour of New Zealand. Official sporting contacts between South Africa and New Zealand did not occur again until after the fall of apartheid.

Australia&#x27;s failure to win a gold medal led the country to create the Australian Institute of Sport.

In 2016, the 40th anniversary celebrations were held. In conjunction with the celebrations, the 2016 Quebec Games were held.

The games were the subject of &quot;Games of the XXI Olympiad (Jeux de la XXIe olympiade)&quot;, a 1977 documentary film by Jean Beaudin, Marcel Carrière, Georges Dufaux and Jean-Claude Labrecque.

The 1976 games were also an inspiration for Australian band Black Cab&#x27;s double album of 2014 entitled &quot;Games of the XXI Olympiad&quot;.

<text>The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (1910–1911) is a 29-volume reference work, an edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. It was developed during the encyclopaedia&#x27;s transition from a British to an American publication. Some of its articles were written by the best-known scholars of the time. This edition of the encyclopaedia, containing 40,000 entries, has entered the public domain and is readily available on the Internet. Its use in modern scholarship and as a reliable source has been deemed problematic due to the outdated nature of some of its content. Nevertheless, the 11th edition has retained considerable value as a time capsule of scientific and historical information, as well as scholarly attitudes of the era immediately preceding World War I.

== Background ==

The 1911 eleventh edition was assembled with the management of American publisher Horace Everett Hooper. Hugh Chisholm, who had edited the previous edition, was appointed editor-in-chief, with Walter Alison Phillips as his principal assistant editor.

Originally, Hooper bought the rights to the 25-volume 9th edition and persuaded the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; to issue its reprint, with eleven additional volumes (35 volumes total) as the tenth edition, which was published in 1902. Hooper&#x27;s association with &quot;The Times&quot; ceased in 1909, and he negotiated with the Cambridge University Press to publish the 29-volume eleventh edition. Though it is generally perceived as a quintessentially British work, the eleventh edition had substantial American influences, in not only the increased amount of American and Canadian content, but also the efforts made to make it more popular. American marketing methods also assisted sales. Some 14% of the contributors (214 of 1507) were from North America, and a New York office was established to coordinate their work.

The initials of the encyclopaedia&#x27;s contributors appear at the end of selected articles or at the end of a section in the case of longer articles, such as that on China, and a key is given in each volume to these initials. Some articles were written by the best-known scholars of the time, such as Edmund Gosse, J. B. Bury, Algernon Charles Swinburne, John Muir, Peter Kropotkin, T. H. Huxley, James Hopwood Jeans and William Michael Rossetti. Among the then lesser-known contributors were some who would later become distinguished, such as Ernest Rutherford and Bertrand Russell. Many articles were carried over from the 9th edition, some with minimal updating. Some of the book-length articles were divided into smaller parts for easier reference, yet others were much abridged. The best-known authors generally contributed only a single article or part of an article. Most of the work was done by journalists, British Museum scholars and other scholars. The 1911 edition was the first edition of the encyclopaedia to include more than just a handful of female contributors, with 34 women contributing articles to the edition. These included Adelaide Anderson, Gertrude Bell, Margaret Bryant, Constance Jocelyn Ffoulkes, Harriette Lombard Hennessy, and Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick.

The eleventh edition introduced a number of changes of the format of the &quot;Britannica&quot;. It was the first to be published complete, instead of the previous method of volumes being released as they were ready. The print type was kept in galley proofs and subject to continual updating until publication. It was the first edition of &quot;Britannica&quot; to be issued with a comprehensive index volume in which was added a categorical index, where like topics were listed. It was the first not to include long treatise-length articles. Even though the overall length of the work was about the same as that of its predecessor, the number of articles had increased from 17,000 to 40,000. It was also the first edition of &quot;Britannica&quot; to include biographies of living people. Sixteen maps of the famous 9th edition of &quot;Stielers Handatlas&quot; were exclusively translated to English, converted to imperial units, printed in Gotha, Germany, by Justus Perthes and the maps became a part of this edition. Later editions only included Perthes&#x27; maps as low-quality reproductions.

According to Coleman and Simmons, the content of the encyclopaedia was distributed as follows:

Hooper sold the rights to Sears, Roebuck and Company of Chicago in 1920, completing the &quot;Britannica&quot;″s transition to becoming a substantially American publication. In 1922, an additional three volumes (also edited by Hugh Chisholm) where published, covering the events of the intervening years, including World War I. These, together with a reprint of the eleventh edition, formed the twelfth edition of the work. A similar thirteenth edition, consisting of three volumes plus a reprint of the twelfth edition, was published in 1926. The London editor was J.L. Garvin, as Chisholm had died. The twelfth and thirteenth editions were closely related to the eleventh edition and shared much of the same content. However, it became increasingly apparent that a more thorough update of the work was required.

The fourteenth edition, published in 1929, was considerably revised, with much text eliminated or abridged to make room for new topics. Nevertheless, the eleventh edition was the basis of every later version of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; until the completely new fifteenth edition was published in 1974, using modern information presentation.

The eleventh edition&#x27;s articles are still of value and interest to modern readers and scholars, especially as a cultural artifact: the British Empire was at its maximum, imperialism was largely unchallenged, much of the world was still ruled by monarchs, and the tumultuous world wars were still in the future. They are a resource for topics omitted from modern encyclopaedias, particularly for biography and the history of science and technology. As a literary text, the encyclopaedia has value as an example of early 20th-century prose. For example, it employs literary devices, such as pathetic fallacy (attribution of human-like traits to impersonal forces or inanimate objects), which are not as common in modern reference texts.

== Reviews ==

In 1917, using the pseudonym of S. S. Van Dine, the US art critic and author Willard Huntington Wright published &quot;&quot;, a 200+ page criticism of inaccuracies and biases of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; eleventh edition. Wright claimed that &quot;Britannica&quot; was &quot;characterized by misstatements, inexcusable omissions, rabid and patriotic prejudices, personal animosities, blatant errors of fact, scholastic ignorance, gross neglect of non-British culture, an astounding egotism, and an undisguised contempt for American progress&quot;.

Amos Urban Shirk, known for having read the eleventh and fourteenth editions in their entirety, said he found the fourteenth edition to be a &quot;big improvement&quot; over the eleventh, stating that &quot;most of the material had been completely rewritten&quot;.

Robert Collison, in &quot;Encyclopaedias: Their History Throughout The Ages&quot; (1966), wrote of the eleventh edition that it &quot;was probably the finest edition of the &quot;Britannica&quot; ever issued, and it ranks with the and the &quot;Espasa&quot; as one of the three greatest encyclopaedias. It was the last edition to be produced almost in its entirety in Britain, and its position in time as a summary of the world&#x27;s knowledge just before the outbreak of World War I is particularly valuable&quot;.

Sir Kenneth Clark, in &quot;Another Part of the Wood&quot; (1974), wrote of the eleventh edition, &quot;One leaps from one subject to another, fascinated as much by the play of mind and the idiosyncrasies of their authors as by the facts and dates. It must be the last encyclopaedia in the tradition of Diderot which assumes that information can be made memorable only when it is slightly coloured by prejudice. When T. S. Eliot wrote &#x27;Soul curled up on the window seat reading the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;,&#x27; he was certainly thinking of the eleventh edition.&quot; (Clark refers to Eliot&#x27;s 1929 poem &quot;Animula&quot;.) It was one of Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s favourite works, and was a source of information and enjoyment for his entire working life.

In 1912, mathematician L. C. Karpinski criticised the eleventh edition for inaccuracies in articles on the history of mathematics, none of which had been written by specialists.

English writer and former priest Joseph McCabe claimed in &quot;Lies and Fallacies of the Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1947) that &quot;Britannica&quot; was censored under pressure from the Roman Catholic Church after the 11th edition. Initially, the eleventh edition received criticism from members of the Roman Catholic Church, who accused it of misrepresenting and being biased against Catholics. The most &quot;vociferous&quot; American Catholic critics of the eleventh edition were editors of the Christian magazine &quot;America&quot;.

Authorities ranging from Virginia Woolf to professors criticised the 11th edition for having bourgeois and old-fashioned opinions on art, literature, and social sciences. A contemporary Cornell professor, Edward B. Titchener, wrote in 1912, &quot;the new &quot;Britannica&quot; does not reproduce the psychological atmosphere of its day and generation... Despite the halo of authority, and despite the scrutiny of the staff, the great bulk of the secondary articles in general psychology ... are not adapted to the requirements of the intelligent reader&quot;.

In an April 2012 article, Nate Pederson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that the eleventh edition represented &quot;a peak of colonial optimism before the slaughter of war&quot; and that the edition &quot;has acquired an almost mythic reputation among collectors&quot;.

Critics have charged several editions with racism, sexism, and antisemitism. The eleventh edition the Ku Klux Klan as protecting the white race and restoring order to the American South after the American Civil War, citing the need to &quot;control the negro&quot;, and &quot;the frequent occurrence of the crime of rape by negro men upon white women&quot;. Similarly, argues for eugenics, stating that it is irrational to &quot;propagate low orders of intelligence, to feed the ranks of paupers, defectives and criminals ... which to-day constitute so threatening an obstacle to racial progress&quot;. The eleventh edition has no biography of Marie Curie, despite her winning the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911, although she is mentioned briefly under the biography of her husband Pierre Curie. The &quot;Britannica&quot; employed a large female editorial staff that wrote hundreds of articles for which they were not given credit.

== Public domain ==
The 1911 edition is no longer restricted by copyright, and it is therefore freely available in several more modern forms. While it may once have been a reliable description of the academic consensus of its time, many modern readers find fault with the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; for several major errors, ethnocentric and racist remarks, and other issues:

* Contemporary opinions of race and ethnicity are included in the &quot;Encyclopædia&quot;″s articles. For example, the entry for &quot;Negro&quot; states, &quot;Mentally the negro is inferior to the white... the arrest or even deterioration of mental development [after adolescence] is no doubt very largely after puberty sexual matters take the first place in the negro&#x27;s life and thoughts.&quot; The article about the American Revolutionary War attributes the success of the United States in part to &quot;a population mainly of good English blood and instincts&quot;.
* Many articles are now outdated factually, in particular those concerning science, technology, international and municipal law, and medicine. For example, the article on the vitamin deficiency disease beriberi speculates that it is caused by a fungus, vitamins not having been discovered at the time. 
* Even where the facts might still be accurate, new information, theories and perspectives developed since 1911 have substantially changed the way the same facts might be interpreted. For example, the modern interpretation of the history of the Visigoths is now very different from that of 1911; readers of the eleventh edition who want to know about the social customs and political life of the tribe and its warriors are told to look up the entry for their king, Alaric I.

The eleventh edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; has become a commonly quoted source, both because of the reputation of the &quot;Britannica&quot; and because it is now in the public domain and has been made available on the Internet. It has been used as a source by many modern projects, including Wikipedia and the &quot;Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia&quot;.
