<text>Oberon , also designated , is the outermost and second-largest major moon of the planet Uranus. It is the second-most massive of the Uranian moons, and the tenth-largest moon in the Solar System. Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Oberon is named after the mythical king of the fairies who appears as a character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Its orbit lies partially outside Uranus&#x27;s magnetosphere.

Oberon likely formed from the accretion disk that surrounded Uranus just after the planet&#x27;s formation. The moon consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water may be present at the boundary between the mantle and the core. The surface of Oberon, which is dark and slightly red in color, appears to have been primarily shaped by asteroid and comet impacts. It is covered by numerous impact craters reaching 210 km in diameter. Oberon possesses a system of &quot;chasmata&quot; (graben or scarps) formed during crustal extension as a result of the expansion of its interior during its early evolution.

The Uranian system has been studied up close only once: the spacecraft &quot;Voyager 2&quot; took several images of Oberon in January 1986, allowing 40% of the moon&#x27;s surface to be mapped.

== Discovery and naming ==
Oberon was discovered by William Herschel on January 11, 1787; on the same day, he discovered Uranus&#x27;s largest moon, Titania. He later reported the discoveries of four more satellites, although they were subsequently revealed as spurious. For nearly fifty years following their discovery, Titania and Oberon would not be observed by any instrument other than William Herschel&#x27;s, although the moon can be seen from Earth with a present-day high-end amateur telescope.

All of the moons of Uranus are named after characters created by William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. The name Oberon was derived from Oberon, the King of the Fairies in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by Herschel&#x27;s son John in 1852, at the request of William Lassell, who had discovered the other two moons, Ariel and Umbriel, the year before. It is uncertain if Herschel devised the names, or if Lassell did so and then sought Herschel&#x27;s permission. The adjectival form of the name is &quot;Oberonian,&quot; .

Oberon was initially referred to as &quot;the second satellite of Uranus&quot; and in 1848 was given the designation &#x27; by Lassell, although he sometimes used Herschel&#x27;s numbering (where Titania and Oberon are II and IV). In 1851, Lassell eventually numbered all four known satellites in order of their distance from the planet by Roman numerals, and since then Oberon has been designated &#x27;.

== Orbit ==
Oberon orbits Uranus at a distance of about 584,000 km, being the farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Oberon&#x27;s orbit has a small orbital eccentricity and inclination relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 13.5 days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Oberon is tidally locked, with one face always pointing toward the planet. Oberon spends a significant part of its orbit outside the Uranian magnetosphere. As a result, its surface is directly struck by the solar wind. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by the magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).

Because Uranus orbits the Sun almost on its side, and its moons orbit in the planet&#x27;s equatorial plane, they (including Oberon) are subject to an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in a complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the sun rising close to the zenith over one of the poles at each solstice. The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere&#x27;s 1986 summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was in darkness. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus&#x27;s moons become possible. One such event, which lasted for about six minutes, was observed on May 4, 2007, when Oberon occulted Umbriel.

== Composition and internal structure ==
Oberon is the second-largest and second-most massive of the Uranian moons after Titania, and the ninth-most massive moon in the Solar System. It is the tenth-largest moon by size however, since Rhea, the second-largest moon of Saturn and the ninth-largest moon, is nearly the same size as Oberon although it is about 0.4% larger, despite Oberon having more mass than Rhea. Oberon&#x27;s density of 1.68 g/cm3, which is higher than the typical density of Saturn&#x27;s satellites, indicates that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice on the surface of the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Oberon&#x27;s trailing hemisphere than on the leading hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on other Uranian moons, where the leading hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to impact gardening (the creation of soil via impacts) of the surface, which is stronger on the leading hemisphere. Meteorite impacts tend to sputter (knock out) ice from the surface, leaving dark non-ice material behind. The dark material itself may have formed as a result of radiation processing of methane clathrates or radiation darkening of other organic compounds.

Oberon may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (480 km) is about 63% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 54% of the moon&#x27;s mass—the proportions are dictated by the moon&#x27;s composition. The pressure in the center of Oberon is about 0.5 GPa (5 kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear. If the ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze, Oberon may possess a liquid ocean layer at the core–mantle boundary. The thickness of this ocean, if it exists, is up to 40 km and its temperature is around 180 K (close to the water–ammonia eutectic temperature of 176 K). However, the internal structure of Oberon depends heavily on its thermal history, which is poorly known at present. Albeit more recent publications seem to be in favour of active subterranean oceans throughout the larger moons of Uranus.

== Surface features and geology ==
Oberon is the second-darkest large moon of Uranus after Umbriel. Its surface shows a strong opposition surge: its reflectivity decreases from 31% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 22% at an angle of about 1°. Oberon has a low Bond albedo of about 14%. Its surface is generally red in color, except for fresh impact deposits, which are neutral or slightly blue. Oberon is, in fact, the reddest among the major Uranian moons. Its trailing and leading hemispheres are asymmetrical: the latter is much redder than the former, because it contains more dark red material. The reddening of the surfaces is often a result of space weathering caused by bombardment of the surface by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Oberon is more likely caused by accretion of a reddish material spiraling in from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly from irregular satellites, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere, similar to Saturn&#x27;s moon Iapetus.

Two primary classes of geological features dominate Oberon&#x27;s surface: impact craters and chasmata (&#x27;canyons&#x27;—deep, elongated, steep-sided depressions which would probably be described as rift valleys or escarpments if on Earth). Oberon&#x27;s surface is the most heavily cratered of all the Uranian moons, with a crater density approaching saturation—when the formation of new craters is balanced by destruction of old ones. This high number of craters indicates that Oberon has the most ancient surface among Uranus&#x27;s moons. The crater diameters range up to 206 kilometers for the largest known crater, Hamlet. Many large craters are surrounded by bright impact ejecta (rays) consisting of relatively fresh ice. The largest craters, Hamlet, Othello and Macbeth, have floors made of a very dark material deposited after their formation. A peak with a height of about 11 km was observed in some &quot;Voyager&quot; images near the south-eastern limb of Oberon, which may be the central peak of a large impact basin with a diameter of about 375 km. Oberon&#x27;s surface is intersected by a system of canyons, which, however, are less widespread than those found on Titania. The canyons&#x27; sides are probably scarps produced by normal faults which can be either old or fresh: the latter transect the bright deposits of some large craters, indicating that they formed later. The most prominent Oberonian canyon is Mommur Chasma.

The geology of Oberon was influenced by two competing forces: impact crater formation and endogenic resurfacing. The former acted over the moon&#x27;s entire history and is primarily responsible for its present-day appearance. The latter processes were active for a period following the moon&#x27;s formation. The endogenic processes were mainly tectonic in nature and led to the formation of the canyons, which are actually giant cracks in the ice crust. The canyons obliterated parts of the older surface. The cracking of the crust was caused by the expansion of Oberon by about 0.5%, which occurred in two phases corresponding to the old and young canyons.

The nature of the dark patches, which mainly occur on the leading hemisphere and inside craters, is not known. Some scientists hypothesized that they are of cryovolcanic origin (analogs of lunar maria), while others think that the impacts excavated dark material buried beneath the pure ice (crust). In the latter case Oberon should be at least partially differentiated, with the ice crust lying atop the non-differentiated interior.

== Origin and evolution ==
Oberon is thought to have formed from an accretion disc or subnebula: a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the relatively high density of Oberon and other Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide and N2 instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.

Oberon&#x27;s accretion probably lasted for several thousand years. The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon&#x27;s outer layer. The maximum temperature of around 230 K was reached at the depth of about 60 km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Oberon heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon&#x27;s crust leading to cracking. The present-day system of canyons may be a result of this process, which lasted for about 200 million years, implying that any endogenous activity from this cause ceased billions of years ago.

The initial accretional heating together with continued decay of radioactive elements were probably strong enough to melt the ice if some antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. Further melting may have led to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (&#x27;ocean&#x27;) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176 K. If the temperature dropped below this value the ocean would have frozen by now. Freezing of the water would have led to expansion of the interior, which may have also contributed to the formation of canyon-like graben. Still, present knowledge of the evolution of Oberon is very limited. Although recent analysis concluded that its more likely that the larger moons of Uranus having active subsurface oceans.

== Exploration ==
So far the only close-up images of Oberon have been from the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Since the closest approach of &quot;Voyager 2&quot; to Oberon was 470,600 km, the best images of this moon have spatial resolution of about 6 km. The images cover about 40% of the surface, but only 25% of the surface was imaged with a resolution that allows geological mapping. At the time of the flyby the southern hemisphere of Oberon was pointed towards the Sun, so the dark northern hemisphere could not be studied. No other spacecraft has ever visited the Uranian system.

<doc id="66782" wikidata="Q276463" url="?curid=66782" title="The Psychedelic Furs">
<text>The Psychedelic Furs are an English rock band founded in London in February 1977. Led by lead vocalist Richard Butler and his brother Tim Butler on bass guitar, the Psychedelic Furs are one of the many acts spawned from the British post-punk scene.

The band had several hits in their early career. In 1986, filmmaker John Hughes used their song &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; for his film &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;. They went on hiatus after they finished touring in 1992, but resumed in 2000 and continue to perform live. The band released &quot;Made of Rain&quot;, their first studio album in nearly three decades, on 31 July 2020.

==Career==
===Early days (1977–1980)===
Richard Butler stated that the Psychedelic Furs began rehearsing in his family&#x27;s front room but were soon banished because of the noise. The band was initially called RKO, then Radio. They later vacillated between calling themselves the Europeans and the Psychedelic Furs, playing gigs under both names before permanently settling on the latter. The word psychedelic was chosen to separate the band from punk rockers who ostentatiously scorned the legacy of 1960s rock music.

The band initially consisted of Richard Butler (vocals), Tim Butler (bass guitar), Duncan Kilburn (saxophone), Paul Wilson (drums), and Roger Morris (guitars). By 1979, this line-up had expanded to a sextet with Vince Ely replacing Wilson on drums and John Ashton joining as a second guitarist. The Psychedelic Furs&#x27; debut, a self-titled album released in March 1980, was produced by Steve Lillywhite. The album quickly established the band on radio in Europe and was a No. 18 hit in the UK Albums Chart. The album also found success in Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Australia.

===Success (1981–1991)===
The Furs found success in the US with their next release, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Talk Talk Talk,&quot; which saw the band making its debut on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In the UK, the album yielded two charting singles, &quot;Dumb Waiters&quot; and the original version of &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;. The latter song served as inspiration for the 1986 John Hughes film &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; and was re-recorded for the platinum-selling &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; soundtrack – though Richard Butler was later adamant that the cinematic interpretation had very little to do with the song&#x27;s original intent.

In 1982, the band was reduced to a quartet with the departures of Morris and Kilburn and moved to the U.S. in search of a producer. The band recorded their next album, &quot;Forever Now&quot;, with record producer Todd Rundgren in Woodstock, New York. Released in September 1982, this album contained &quot;Love My Way&quot;, which became another UK chart entry, and also their first US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 single.

Ely left the band after &quot;Forever Now&quot; (though he would later return in 1988). The next album, &quot;Mirror Moves&quot; was produced by Keith Forsey (who also programmed the drums and became the band&#x27;s drummer) and featured the songs &quot;The Ghost in You&quot; and &quot;Heaven&quot;. Both charted in the UK and &quot;Heaven&quot; became the band&#x27;s highest charting UK hit at the time, peaking at No. 29. Columbia Records opted for &quot;Here Come Cowboys&quot; for the corresponding US release which failed to chart but &quot;The Ghost In You&quot; was a hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In Canada, &quot;The Ghost In You&quot; also charted. &quot;Mirror Moves&quot; became a Top 20 album on the Canadian Albums Chart and was named the No. 1 album of 1984 by Toronto new wave radio station CFNY.
By the mid-1980s, the band had become a staple on both US college radio and modern rock radio stations. Simultaneously, they were experiencing consistent mainstream success placing several singles in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Still, according to biographer Dave Thompson, they would &quot;have more impact on future musicians than they ever did in the marketplace.&quot;

In 1986, the band recorded a new version of &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; for the film soundtrack. Released as a single, it became their biggest hit to date in the US and their biggest UK hit. Butler later claimed that the success of &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; caused the band to be pressured into entering the recording studio with producer Chris Kimsey to record a follow-up release before they were ready. The result was &quot;Midnight to Midnight&quot;, their biggest Top 40 success to date, but an album that Richard Butler later characterised as &quot;hollow, vapid and weak&quot;. A more overtly commercial effort than their prior recordings, the album also featured the single &quot;Heartbreak Beat&quot;, the Furs&#x27; biggest Top 40 hit in the US. The album also featured drummer Paul Garisto and saxophonist Mars Williams, both of whom toured with the band.

In the wake of &quot;Midnight to Midnight&quot;, Ely returned, and the Furs issued the single &quot;All That Money Wants&quot;, a track recorded for the 1988 best-of compilation album &quot;All of This and Nothing&quot;. 1989&#x27;s &quot;Book of Days&quot;, produced by the band and David M. Allen, featured the singles &quot;Should God Forget&quot; and &quot;House&quot;. Produced by the band and Stephen Street, 1991&#x27;s &quot;World Outside&quot; included the single &quot;Until She Comes&quot; and was the Furs&#x27; final studio album for more than two decades. From 1988 on, the Furs&#x27; singles had steady chart success with three No. 1 hits on the newly established US Modern Rock Tracks chart between 1988 and 1991. &quot;All That Money Wants&quot; was a No. 1 hit in 1988, while &quot;House&quot; topped the chart in 1990 and &quot;Until She Comes&quot; was No. 1 in 1991.

===Hiatus and reunion (2000–present)===
The band took a long break in the early 1990s, with Richard and Tim Butler going on to found Love Spit Love with Richard Fortus and Frank Ferrer (both of whom would later join Guns N&#x27; Roses). In 2000, Richard Butler, Tim Butler, and Ashton reformed the Psychedelic Furs. The touring lineup also included Fortus and, later, Ferrer. They released a live album, &quot;Beautiful Chaos: Greatest Hits Live&quot; , which included a new studio recording, &quot;Alive (For Once in My Lifetime)&quot;.

In 2006, Richard Butler released a solo album, &quot;Richard Butler&quot;. Since re-forming in 2001, the band continued to tour worldwide. The current Psychedelic Furs touring line-up includes Richard Butler, Tim Butler, Zack Alford, Amanda Kramer, and Rich Good.

In 2017, the band&#x27;s 1984 single &quot;The Ghost in You&quot; was featured in the second season of Netflix hit series &quot;Stranger Things&quot; and was included on the Sony Music soundtrack companion to the season, &quot;Stranger Things: Music from the Netflix Original Series&quot;, released in October 2017. That same year, the band&#x27;s 1982 single &quot;Love My Way&quot; was played several times in the Oscar-nominated film &quot;Call Me by Your Name&quot;.

The Psychedelic Furs released their eighth studio album &quot;Made of Rain&quot; on 31 July 2020 to positive reviews. This release marked the first full-length studio album by the band since 1991&#x27;s &quot;World Outside&quot;. It became the band&#x27;s second-highest charting UK Album ever and featured at the end-of-year Best Albums roundup in &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;Uncut&quot;, &quot;Classic Pop&quot;, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and &quot;Vive Le Rock&quot; among others. &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe&quot;, the first single from the album was released on 20 January 2020. It was followed by &quot;You&#x27;ll Be Mine&quot;, &quot;No-One&quot; and &quot;Come All Ye Faithful&quot;, each with an official video.
On 1 March 2021, the band released the official video for &quot;Made of Rain&quot;&#x27;s fifth single &quot;Wrong Train&quot;. It premiered exclusively on NME.com and was inspired by Richard Butler&#x27;s paintings. He starred in the video himself.
The Strokes&#x27; Grammy Award-winning album &quot;The New Abnormal&quot; (2020) featured the song &quot;Eternal Summer&quot; which quotes the Furs&#x27; &quot;The Ghost in You&quot;, for which songwriters Richard and Tim Butler received songwriting credits.

On 1 September 2021, two weeks before the Made of Rain Tour kicked-off, the band released a new single &quot;Evergreen&quot;, from the &quot;Made of Rain&quot; sessions. According to Richard Butler it is about &quot;memory and the passing of time.&quot;

Richard Butler co-wrote songs with Martin Gore for Depeche Mode&#x27;s fifteenth studio album &quot;Memento Mori&quot; (2023), including the lead single &quot;Ghosts Again&quot;.

Saxophonist Mars Williams died on 20 November 2023.

<doc id="66783" wikidata="Q1569639" url="?curid=66783" title="Interchange File Format">
<text>Interchange File Format (IFF) is a generic digital container file format originally introduced by Electronic Arts (in cooperation with Commodore) in 1985 to facilitate transfer of data between software produced by different companies.

IFF files do not have any standard filename extension. On many systems that generate IFF files, file extensions are not important because the operating system stores file format metadata separately from the file name. The codice_1 filename extension is commonly used for the ILBM image file format, which uses the IFF container format.

Resource Interchange File Format is a format developed by Microsoft and IBM in 1991 that is based on IFF, except the byte order has been changed to little-endian to match the x86 microprocessor architecture. Apple&#x27;s Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF) is a big-endian audio file format developed from IFF. The TIFF image file format is not related to IFF.

==Structure==
An IFF file is built up from chunks. Each chunk begins with what the specification calls a &quot;Type ID&quot; (what the Macintosh called an OSType, and Windows developers might call a FourCC). This is followed by a 32-bit signed integer (all integers in IFF file structure are big-endian) specifying the size of the following data (the chunk content) in bytes. Because the specification includes explicit lengths for each chunk, it is possible for a parser to skip over chunks that it either can&#x27;t or doesn&#x27;t care to process.

This structure is closely related to the type–length–value (TLV) representation.

There are predefined &quot;group&quot; chunks, with type IDs codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4. A codice_2 chunk is like a record structure, containing a type ID (indicating the record type) followed by nested chunks specifying the record fields. A codice_3 is a factoring structure containing a series of codice_7 (property) chunks plus nested group chunks to which those properties apply. A codice_4 is just a collection of nested chunks with no special semantics. Group chunks can contain other group chunks, depending on the needs of the application. Group chunks, like their simpler counterparts, contain a length element. Skipping over a group can thus be done with a simple relative seek operation.

Chunks must begin on even file offsets, as befits the origins of IFF on the Motorola 68000 processor, which couldn&#x27;t address quantities larger than a byte on odd addresses. Thus chunks with odd lengths will be &quot;padded&quot; to an even byte boundary by adding a so-called &quot;pad byte&quot; after their regular end.

The top-level structure of an IFF file consists of exactly one of the group chunks: codice_2, codice_3 or codice_4, where codice_2 is by far the most common one.

Each type of chunk typically has a different internal structure, which could be numerical data, text, or raw data. It is also possible to include other IFF files as if they are chunks (note that they have the same structure: four letters followed with length), and some formats use this. There are standard chunks that could be present in any IFF file, such as codice_13 (containing text with information about author of the file), codice_14 (containing text with annotation, usually name of the program that created the file), codice_15 (containing text with name of the work in the file), codice_16 (containing file version), codice_17 (containing text with copyright information). There are also chunks that are common among a number of formats, such as codice_18, which holds color palette in ILBM, ANIM and DR2D files (pictures, animations and vector pictures). There are chunks that have a common name but hold different data such as codice_19, which could store an image in an ILBM file and sound in an 8SVX file. And finally, there are chunks unique to their file type. Some programs that create IFF files add chunks to them with their internal data; these same files can later be read by other programs without any disruption (because their parsers could skip uninteresting chunks), which is a great advantage of IFF and similar formats.

<text>Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF) is an audio file format standard used for storing sound data for personal computers and other electronic audio devices. The format was developed by Apple Inc. in 1988 based on Electronic Arts&#x27; Interchange File Format (IFF, widely used on Amiga systems) and is most commonly used on Apple Macintosh computer systems.

The audio data in most AIFF files is uncompressed pulse-code modulation (PCM). This type of AIFF file uses much more disk space than lossy formats like MP3—about 10 MB for one minute of stereo audio at a sample rate of 44.1 kHz and a bit depth of 16 bits. There is also a compressed variant of AIFF known as AIFF-C or AIFC, with various defined compression codecs.

In addition to audio data, AIFF can include loop point data and the musical note of a sample, for use by hardware samplers and musical applications.

The file extension for the standard AIFF format is codice_1 or codice_2. For the compressed variants it is supposed to be codice_3, but codice_1 or codice_2 are accepted as well by audio applications supporting the format.

==AIFF on macOS==
With the development of the OS X operating system now known as macOS, Apple created a new type of AIFF which is, in effect, an alternative little-endian byte order format.

Because the AIFF architecture has no provision for alternative byte order, Apple used the existing AIFF-C compression architecture, and created a &quot;pseudo-compressed&quot; codec called sowt (twos spelled backwards). The only difference between a standard AIFF file and an AIFF-C/sowt file is the byte order; there is no compression involved at all.

Apple uses this new little-endian AIFF type as its standard on macOS. When a file is imported to or exported from iTunes in &quot;AIFF&quot; format, it is actually AIFF-C/sowt that is being used. When audio from an audio CD is imported by dragging to the macOS Desktop, the resulting file is also an AIFF-C/sowt. In all cases, Apple refers to the files simply as &quot;AIFF&quot;, and uses the codice_1 extension.

For the vast majority of users this technical situation is completely unnoticeable and irrelevant. The sound quality of standard AIFF and AIFF-C/sowt are identical, and the data can be converted back and forth without loss. Users of older audio applications, however, may find that an AIFF-C/sowt file will not play, or will prompt the user to convert the format on opening, or will play as static.

All traditional AIFF and AIFF-C files continue to work normally on macOS, and many third-party audio applications as well as hardware continue to use the standard AIFF big-endian byte order.

==AIFF Apple Loops==
Apple has also created another recent extension to the AIFF format in the form of Apple Loops used by GarageBand and Logic Pro, which allows the inclusion of data for pitch and tempo shifting by an application in the more common variety, and MIDI-sequence data and references to GarageBand playback instruments in another variety.

Apple Loops use either the codice_1 (or codice_2) or codice_9 extension regardless of type.

==Data format==
An AIFF file is divided into a number of chunks. Each chunk is identified by a &quot;chunk ID&quot; more broadly referred to as FourCC.

Types of chunks found in AIFF files:

* Common Chunk (required)
* Sound Data Chunk (required)
* Marker Chunk
* Instrument Chunk
* Comment Chunk
* Name Chunk
* Author Chunk
* Copyright Chunk
* Annotation Chunk
* Audio Recording Chunk
* MIDI Data Chunk
* Application Chunk
* ID3 Chunk

==Metadata==
AIFF files can store metadata in Name, Author, Comment, Annotation, and Copyright chunks. An ID3v2 tag chunk can also be embedded in AIFF files, as well as an Application Chunk with Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) data in it.

==Common compression types==
AIFF supports only uncompressed PCM data. AIFF-C also supports compressed audio formats, which can be specified in the &quot;COMM&quot; chunk. The compression type is &quot;NONE&quot; for PCM audio data. The compression type is accompanied by a printable name. Common compression types and names include, but are not limited to:

<doc id="66786" wikidata="Q41931" url="?curid=66786" title="Hanging Gardens of Babylon">
<text>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. The Hanging Gardens&#x27; name is derived from the Greek word (, ), which has a broader meaning than the modern English word &quot;hanging&quot; and refers to trees being planted on a raised structure such as a terrace.

According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as &quot;The Marvel of Mankind&quot;, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife, Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. The construction of the Hanging Gardens has also been attributed to the legendary queen Semiramis and they have been called the &quot;Hanging Gardens of Semiramis&quot; as an alternative name.

The Hanging Gardens are the only one of the Seven Wonders whose location has not been definitively established. No extant Babylonian texts mention the gardens and no definitive archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon. Three theories have been suggested to account for this: first, that the gardens were purely mythical, and the descriptions found in ancient Greek and Roman writings (including those of Strabo, Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus) represented a romantic ideal of an eastern garden; second, that they existed in Babylon but were destroyed sometime around the first century AD; and third, that the legend refers to a well-documented garden that the Assyrian King Sennacherib (704–681 BC) built in his capital city of Nineveh on the River Tigris, near the modern city of Mosul.

== Descriptions in classical literature ==
There are five principal writers whose descriptions of Babylon exist in some form today. These writers concern themselves with the size of the Hanging Gardens, their overall design and means of irrigation, and why they were built.

Josephus () quotes a description of the gardens by Berossus, a Babylonian priest of Marduk, whose writing is the earliest known mention of the gardens. Berossus described the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II and is the only source to credit that king with the construction of the Hanging Gardens.


Diodorus Siculus (active ) seems to have consulted the 4th century BC texts of both Cleitarchus (a historian of Alexander the Great) and Ctesias of Cnidus. Diodorus ascribes the construction to a &quot;Syrian king&quot;. He states that the garden was in the shape of a square, with each side approximately four plethra long. The garden was tiered, with the uppermost gallery being 50 cubits high. The walls, 22 feet thick, were made of brick. The bases of the tiered sections were sufficiently deep to provide root growth for the largest trees, and the gardens were irrigated from the nearby Euphrates.

Quintus Curtius Rufus (fl. 1st century AD) probably drew on the same sources as Diodorus. He states that the gardens were located on top of a citadel, which was 20 stadia in circumference. He attributes the building of the gardens to a &quot;Syrian king&quot;, again for the reason that his queen missed her homeland.

The account of Strabo () possibly based his description on the lost account of Onesicritus from the 4th century BC. He states that the gardens were watered by means of an Archimedes&#x27; screw leading to the gardens from the Euphrates river.

The last of the classical sources thought to be independent of the others is &quot;A Handbook to the Seven Wonders of the World&quot; by the paradoxographer Philo of Byzantium, writing in the 4th to 5th century AD (not to be confused with the earlier engineer of the same name). The method of raising water by screw matches that described by Strabo. Philo praises the engineering and ingenuity of building vast areas of deep soil, which had a tremendous mass, so far above the natural grade of the surrounding land, as well as the irrigation techniques.

== Historical existence ==
It is unclear whether the Hanging Gardens were an actual construction or a poetic creation, owing to the lack of documentation in contemporaneous Babylonian sources. There is also no mention of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s wife Amytis (or any other wives), although a political marriage to a Median or Persian would not have been unusual. Many records exist of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s works, yet his long and complete inscriptions do not mention any garden. However, the gardens were said to still exist at the time that later writers described them, and some of these accounts are regarded as deriving from people who had visited Babylon. Herodotus, who describes Babylon in his &quot;Histories&quot;, does not mention the Hanging Gardens, although it could be that the gardens were not yet well known to the Greeks at the time of his visit.

To date, no archaeological evidence has been found at Babylon for the Hanging Gardens. It is possible that evidence exists beneath the Euphrates, which cannot be excavated safely at present. The river flowed east of its current position during the time of Nebuchadnezzar II, and little is known about the western portion of Babylon. Rollinger has suggested that Berossus attributed the Gardens to Nebuchadnezzar for political reasons, and that he had adopted the legend from elsewhere.

== Identification with Sennacherib&#x27;s gardens at Nineveh ==

Oxford scholar Stephanie Dalley has proposed that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were actually the well-documented gardens constructed by the Assyrian king Sennacherib (reigned 704 – 681 BC) for his palace at Nineveh; Dalley posits that during the intervening centuries the two sites became confused, and the extensive gardens at Sennacherib&#x27;s palace were attributed to Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s Babylon. Archaeological excavations have found traces of a vast system of aqueducts attributed to Sennacherib by an inscription on its remains, which Dalley proposes were part of an series of canals, dams, and aqueducts used to carry water to Nineveh with water-raising screws used to raise it to the upper levels of the gardens.

Dalley bases her arguments on recent developments in the analysis of contemporary Akkadian inscriptions. Her main points are:

* The name &quot;Babylon&quot;, meaning &quot;Gate of the Gods&quot;, was the name given to several Mesopotamian cities. Sennacherib renamed the city gates of Nineveh after gods, which suggests that he wished his city to be considered &quot;a Babylon&quot;.
* Only Josephus names Nebuchadnezzar as the king who built the gardens; although Nebuchadnezzar left many inscriptions, none mentions any garden or engineering works. Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus specify a &quot;Syrian&quot; king. By contrast, Sennacherib left written descriptions, and there is archaeological evidence of his water engineering. His grandson Assurbanipal pictured the mature garden on a sculptured wall panel in his palace.
* Sennacherib called his new palace and garden &quot;a wonder for all peoples&quot;. He describes the making and operation of screws to raise water in his garden.
* The descriptions of the classical authors fit closely to these contemporary records. Before the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC Alexander the Great camped for four days near the aqueduct at Jerwan. The historians who travelled with him would have had ample time to investigate the enormous works around them, recording them in Greek. These first-hand accounts have not survived into modern times, but were quoted by later Greek writers.

King Sennacherib&#x27;s garden was well-known not just for its beautya year-round oasis of lush green in a dusty summer landscapebut also for the marvelous feats of water engineering that maintained the garden. There was a tradition of Assyrian royal garden building. King Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC) had created a canal, which cut through the mountains. Fruit tree orchards were planted. Also mentioned were pines, cypresses and junipers; almond trees, date trees, ebony, rosewood, olive, oak, tamarisk, walnut, terebinth, ash, fir, pomegranate, pear, quince, fig, and grapes. A sculptured wall panel of Assurbanipal shows the garden in its maturity. One original panel and the drawing of another are held by the British Museum, although neither is on public display. Several features mentioned by the classical authors are discernible on these contemporary images.
Of Sennacherib&#x27;s palace, he mentions the massive limestone blocks that reinforce the flood defences. Parts of the palace were excavated by Austin Henry Layard in the mid-19th century. His citadel plan shows contours which would be consistent with Sennacherib&#x27;s garden, but its position has not been confirmed. The area has been used as a military base in recent times, making it difficult to investigate further.

The irrigation of such a garden demanded an upgraded water supply to the city of Nineveh. The canals stretched over into the mountains. Sennacherib was proud of the technologies he had employed and describes them in some detail on his inscriptions. At the headwater of Bavian (Khinnis) his inscription mentions automatic sluice gates. An enormous aqueduct crossing the valley at Jerwan was constructed of over two million dressed stones. It used stone arches and waterproof cement. On it is written:

Sennacherib claimed that he had built a &quot;Wonder for all Peoples&quot;, and said he was the first to deploy a new casting technique in place of the &quot;lost-wax&quot; process for his monumental (30 tonne) bronze castings. He was able to bring the water into his garden at a high level because it was sourced from further up in the mountains, and he then raised the water even higher by deploying his new water screws. This meant he could build a garden that towered above the landscape with large trees on the top of the terracesa stunning artistic effect that surpassed those of his predecessors.

==Plants==
The gardens, as depicted in artworks, featured blossoming flowers, ripe fruit, burbling waterfalls and terraces exuberant with rich foliage. Based on Babylonian literature, tradition, and the environmental characteristics of the area, some of the following plants may have been found in the gardens:

*Olive (&quot;Olea europaea&quot;)
*Quince (&quot;Cydonia oblonga&quot;)
*Common pear (&quot;Pyrus communis&quot;)
*Fig (&quot;Ficus carica&quot;)
*Almond (&quot;Prunus dulcis&quot;)
*Common grape vine (&quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;)
*Date palm (&quot;Phoenix dactylifera&quot;)
*Athel tamarisk (&quot;Tamarix aphylla&quot;)
*Mt. Atlas mastic tree (&quot;Pistacia atlantica&quot;)

Imported plant varieties that may have been present in the gardens include the cedar, cypress, ebony, pomegranate, plum, rosewood, terebinth, juniper, oak, ash tree, fir, myrrh, walnut, and willow. Some of these plants were suspended over the terraces and draped over its walls with arches underneath.

<doc id="66788" wikidata="Q591279" url="?curid=66788" title="Squeeze (band)">
<text>Squeeze are an English rock band that came to prominence in the United Kingdom during the new wave period of the late 1970s, and continued recording in the 1980s, 1990s and 2010s. In the UK, their singles &quot;Cool for Cats&quot;, &quot;Up the Junction&quot;, and &quot;Labelled with Love&quot; were top-ten chart hits. Though not as commercially successful in the United States, Squeeze had American hits with &quot;Tempted&quot;, &quot;Black Coffee in Bed&quot;, and &quot;Hourglass&quot;, and were considered a part of the Second British Invasion.

In the vast majority of their material, lyrics are written by Chris Difford and music by Glenn Tilbrook, who are guitarists and vocalists in the band. The duo were hailed as &quot;the heirs to Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s throne&quot; during the band&#x27;s initial popularity in the late 1970s. The group formed in Deptford, London, in 1974, and first broke up in 1982. Squeeze then reformed in 1985, and disbanded again in 1999. The band were also noted as a launchpad for the successful careers of their keyboard players, Jools Holland and Paul Carrack.

The band reunited for tours through the United States and United Kingdom in 2007. In 2010, they issued &quot;Spot the Difference&quot;, an album of newly recorded versions of older material. The band&#x27;s first album of all-new material since 1998, &quot;Cradle to the Grave&quot;, was released in October 2015, followed by another album, &quot;The Knowledge&quot;, in October 2017.

==Career==
===First incarnation: 1974–1982===
The band&#x27;s founding members in March 1974 were Chris Difford (guitar, vocals, lyrics), and Glenn Tilbrook (vocals, guitar, music). Difford claims that in 1973, he stole 50p from his mother&#x27;s purse to put a card in a local sweetshop window to advertise for a guitarist to join his band, although he was not actually in a band at the time. Tilbrook was the only person who responded to the advertisement. Difford and Tilbrook began writing songs together, and soon added Jools Holland (keyboards) and Paul Gunn (drums) to form an actual band. The group performed under several names, most frequently &quot;Captain Trundlow&#x27;s Sky Company&quot; or &quot;Skyco&quot;, before selecting the band name &quot;Squeeze&quot; as a facetious tribute to the Velvet Underground&#x27;s oft-derided 1973 album &quot;Squeeze&quot;.

Gilson Lavis replaced Gunn on drums, and Harri Kakoulli joined on bass in 1975.

Squeeze&#x27;s early career was spent around Deptford in south-east London, where they were part of a lively local music scene which included Alternative TV and Dire Straits. Though the group was initially signed to Miles Copeland III&#x27;s BTM Records, the label went under in late 1976, and so their early singles and debut EP, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Packet of Three&quot;, were released on the Deptford Fun City label.

Squeeze&#x27;s first EP and most of their self-titled debut album (1978) were produced by John Cale for A&amp;M Records. Cale had been a member of Velvet Underground from whose album Squeeze took their name. However, the debut album&#x27;s two hit singles (&quot;Take Me I&#x27;m Yours&quot; and &quot;Bang Bang&quot;) were produced by the band themselves, as the label found Cale&#x27;s recordings uncommercial.

In the United States and Canada, the band and album were dubbed &quot;UK Squeeze&quot; owing to legal conflicts arising from a contemporary American band called &quot;Tight Squeeze&quot;. The &quot;UK&quot; was dropped for all subsequent releases. In Australia, the same name change was used due to legal conflicts arising from an existing Sydney-based band also called &quot;Squeeze&quot;. Albums in Australia were credited to &quot;UK Squeeze&quot; up to and including 1985&#x27;s &quot;Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti&quot;.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Cool for Cats&quot; (1979), contained the band&#x27;s two highest charting UK singles in &quot;Cool For Cats&quot; and &quot;Up The Junction&quot;, both of which peaked at No. 2. John Bentley replaced Harry Kakoulli on bass in 1979 following the release of the LP.

&quot;Argybargy&quot; (1980), the band&#x27;s third album, was also a UK hit. It was additionally a mild breakthrough in North America, as the single &quot;Another Nail in My Heart&quot; was a No. 56 hit in Canada, and second single &quot;Pulling Mussels (from the Shell)&quot; received airplay on US rock radio stations. The video for the former was frequently shown on independent video music shows in the US.

Holland left for a solo career in 1980. He was replaced by Paul Carrack, formerly of the soul-pop band Ace and the progressive rock band Roxy Music.

In 1981, the band released &quot;East Side Story&quot;. It was produced by Elvis Costello and Roger Bechirian, and featured Carrack&#x27;s lead vocals on the radio hit &quot;Tempted&quot;. Carrack himself left after the release of &quot;East Side Story&quot;, and was replaced by Don Snow. This line-up recorded the &quot;Sweets from a Stranger&quot; LP in 1982. Negative reviews, the stresses of touring, and conflict between band members led Difford and Tilbrook to break up the band later that year, after releasing a final single, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;.

===Difford and Tilbrook years: 1983–1984===
Difford and Tilbrook continued to work together, and released one self-titled album as the duo Difford &amp; Tilbrook in 1984. Although it is not officially a Squeeze album, to many fans &quot;Difford &amp; Tilbrook&quot; is considered a &quot;lost&quot; Squeeze LP because Difford and Tilbrook were themselves the only constant members of Squeeze. Several Difford &amp; Tilbrook tracks have been featured on officially sanctioned Squeeze compilations, and Tilbrook&#x27;s official site lists &quot;Difford &amp; Tilbrook&quot; as a Squeeze album.

The duo also contributed to a musical written and staged in Deptford during this period, entitled &quot;Labelled with Love&quot; and based in large part on the music of Squeeze.

===Second incarnation: 1985–1999===
Squeeze re-formed to play a one night charity gig in 1985, with all five members from the 1980 &quot;Argybargy&quot; period—Difford, Tilbrook, Holland, Lavis, and Bentley. The performance was such a success that the band unanimously agreed to resume recording and touring as Squeeze. Searching for a different sound, the band replaced Bentley with bassist Keith Wilkinson from the &quot;Difford &amp; Tilbrook&quot; sessions. This line-up released the 1985 LP &quot;Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti&quot;.

The new LP featured complex double-tracked keyboard parts which could not be duplicated by a single keyboard player in a live setting; hence, Jools&#x27; brother Christopher Holland, then aged 17, played and toured as a second keyboardist in 1985. Christopher had also played Hammond organ on the album&#x27;s fourth single &quot;Heartbreaking World&quot;, which was sung by Jools Holland. However, Christopher Holland&#x27;s tenure was short-lived, for he had signed to I.R.S. Records and was pursuing a solo career, so he was replaced by an official new member: Andy Metcalfe of The Soft Boys and The Egyptians. A bassist in those groups, Metcalfe played keyboards with Squeeze. His tenure as the band&#x27;s sixth member lasted until 1988.

In 1987, the sextet recorded the album &quot;Babylon and On&quot;. A successful release on both sides of the Atlantic, this album contained the band&#x27;s only US top 40 hits in &quot;Hourglass&quot; and &quot;853-5937&quot;.

Metcalfe left the band in 1988, leaving the Difford / Tilbrook / Holland / Wilkinson / Lavis line-up to record 1989&#x27;s &quot;Frank&quot;. The LP was a commercial disappointment, from which no charting singles were taken in the UK, and the band was dropped from their long-time label A&amp;M.

Adding a new second keyboard player in the person of Matt Irving, the band issued the live album &quot;A Round and a Bout&quot; on I.R.S. Records in March 1990. Jools Holland left Squeeze again in early 1990, and was not immediately replaced. In his stead, the band used session musicians such as Irving (who was no longer an official band member), Steve Nieve, and Bruce Hornsby for the 1991 release &quot;Play&quot;, which came out on the Reprise label. This release again spawned no UK hits, although in the US the singles &quot;Satisfied&quot; and &quot;Crying in My Sleep&quot; received significant airplay on modern rock stations, and in Canada &quot;Satisfied&quot; was a top 50 hit. However, Reprise dropped the band after this album. Following this, drummer Gilson Lavis was let go in 1992, and replaced by Nieve&#x27;s Attractions bandmate Pete Thomas. Paul Carrack also returned to the band in 1993.

Squeeze re-signed to A&amp;M in time for 1993&#x27;s &quot;Some Fantastic Place&quot;. After a period of commercial decline in the UK, lead single &quot;Third Rail&quot; hit No. 39, becoming Squeeze&#x27;s first UK Top 40 hit in six years.

Squeeze&#x27;s line-up during the mid-1990s changed constantly. The American songwriter Aimee Mann toured as part of the band in 1994, playing both Mann and Squeeze songs. Thomas exited the band that year, and Carrack doubled on snare and keyboards for a few gigs before session drummer Andy Newmark was brought in. Then—still in 1994—Carrack left, which allowed keyboardist Andy Metcalfe to return to the band for a short spell, playing on some live dates. Drummer Kevin Wilkinson (no relation to bassist Keith), formerly of The Waterboys and China Crisis, was also added around this time, replacing Newmark. He lasted through the 1995 album &quot;Ridiculous&quot;, which was recorded by the quartet of Difford, Tilbrook, Wilkinson and Wilkinson. The album spun off three minor hits in the UK: &quot;This Summer&quot;, &quot;Electric Trains&quot; and &quot;Heaven Knows&quot;. (&quot;Heaven Knows&quot; was used as the closing song in the 1995 film &quot;Hackers&quot; starring Angelina Jolie.) In addition, a minimally remixed version of &quot;This Summer&quot; became a No. 32 UK hit in 1996, a year after the original version peaked at No. 36. Despite this, A&amp;M once again dropped Squeeze from their roster in late 1996.

Following the release of &quot;Ridiculous&quot;, Don Snow (now known as Jonn Savannah) returned to Squeeze yet again as their touring keyboard player, but by 1997, the Squeeze line-up had officially dwindled down to just Difford and Tilbrook. That year the duo, billed as Squeeze, released the non-album single &quot;Down in the Valley&quot; as a fundraising single for Charlton Athletic F.C. Tilbrook formed the Quixotic label for this and future Squeeze-related releases, as well as releases by other artists.

For the 1998 album &quot;Domino&quot;, the band was again a quintet consisting of Difford, Tilbrook, bassist Hilaire Penda, ex-Del Amitri drummer Ashley Soan, and yet another returning keyboardist in the person of Christopher Holland. Nick Harper often performed with this version of Squeeze as a guest touring musician, providing additional guitar and vocals. In January 1999, just days before a planned tour, Chris Difford suddenly announced that he was taking a &quot;hiatus&quot; from Squeeze. The last venue at which Squeeze played with Difford was at The Charlotte, Leicester, England. The band subsequently continued as a quartet led by Tilbrook, with Jim Kimberley replacing Soan on some tour dates, and Christopher Holland exiting in the autumn to be replaced by Tilbrook&#x27;s other frequent writing partner Chris Braide.

On 27 November 1999, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Squeeze played their final gig before breaking up again. Difford and Tilbrook embarked on separate solo careers shortly thereafter.

===Solo years: 2000–2006===
In 2003 Difford and Tilbrook collaborated on a song for the first time since &quot;Domino&quot;. The track &quot;Where I Can Be Your Friend&quot; appeared on Tilbrook&#x27;s well-reviewed second solo album, &quot;Transatlantic Ping Pong&quot;. In 2004, the pair worked with music journalist Jim Drury on the retrospective &quot;Squeeze: Song By Song&quot;. In this book they declared they had become better friends since breaking up the band than they ever were while Squeeze was together.

However, a 2004 attempt by the VH1 show &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; to reassemble the mid-1980s line-up of Squeeze (Difford, Tilbrook, Holland, Wilkinson and Lavis) ended in failure. While Difford and bassist Keith Wilkinson were both favourable to the idea and drummer Gilson Lavis expressed interest, Jools Holland felt he was too busy with current projects to participate. Even more crucially, Glenn Tilbrook eventually decided against a band reunion at that point in time.

Still, Difford and Tilbrook&#x27;s friendship continued, and Difford sat in for a few songs at a Tilbrook solo gig in Glasgow in December 2005.

===Third incarnation: 2007–present===
In early 2007 it was announced that Difford and Tilbrook would re-form Squeeze for a series of shows throughout the latter half of the year, in support of Universal and Warner&#x27;s re-issuing of the band&#x27;s back catalogue and the release of a new &#x27;best of&#x27; album, &quot;Essential Squeeze&quot;, on 30 April. Jools Holland and Gilson Lavis were unable to take part in the series of shows, as they were touring under the &quot;Jools Holland &amp; His Rhythm &amp; Blues Orchestra&quot; name for most of the year. However, John Bentley re-joined on bass for the first time since Squeeze&#x27;s last reunion show in 1985. The rest of the line-up was fleshed out by members of Tilbrook&#x27;s touring band, the Fluffers: Stephen Large (keyboards) and Simon Hanson (drums).

On 7 July 2007, at the &quot;Return to the Summer of Love Party&quot; at Hawkhurst, Kent, Difford and Tilbrook, each singing and playing acoustic guitars, played a seven-song set. They played, in order, &quot;Take Me I&#x27;m Yours&quot;, &quot;Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)&quot;, &quot;Is that Love?&quot;, &quot;Tempted&quot;, &quot;Labelled with Love&quot;, &quot;Cool for Cats&quot; and &quot;Up the Junction&quot;. The first actual full-band Squeeze show since 1999 took place less than a week later, at their old haunt The Albany (in Deptford) on Thursday 12 July; this was actually billed as a &quot;warm up&quot; gig prior to the upcoming US tour, and was followed by GuilFest 2007. They toured the US in August 2007, supported on various dates by Fountains of Wayne, Will Hoge, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Aimee Mann, and Cheap Trick.

In November 2007, the band released &quot;Five Live: On Tour in America&quot;, a live CD consisting of recordings from the American tour. Television appearances and live shows in the US and UK followed in 2008, 2009 and 2010.

The band were honoured with a Heritage Award by PRS for Music in March 2010. A plaque was erected at Greenwich Dance&#x27;s The Borough Hall on Royal Hill in Greenwich, London where they had performed their first gig.

Squeeze embarked on their &#x27;Spot The Difference&#x27; tour of the US in July 2010, which continued in the UK in November and December. The CD &quot;Spot The Difference&quot;, a re-recording of Squeeze&#x27;s classic hits, was released in August 2010 to accompany the tour.

On the US tour, during a performance of &quot;Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)&quot; live on the &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; show, Stephen Large played the keyboard solo on an Apple iPad.

In September 2010, Stephen Large left the band and was replaced by Steve Nieve, who had played as a session musician with Squeeze and Difford in the past, but had not—until this line-up change—ever been an official member of the group. However, within a matter of months, Large returned to the Squeeze line-up as Nieve left the band.

This line-up of Difford/Tilbrook/Bentley/Large/Hanson continued to tour throughout 2011 and 2012. A 20-track live recording, &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot;, was issued on iTunes and as a limited-edition white vinyl double LP in April 2012.

Prior to their 2012 UK tour, Squeeze announced on the &quot;Radcliffe &amp; Maconie&quot; show on BBC Radio 6 Music that they would be selling live recordings of every night&#x27;s show on the tour at each venue via a &#x27;Pop up Shop&#x27;. When the tour commenced, each live recording the band sold also came with a 4-song bonus disc entitled &quot;Packet of Four&quot;; these were studio recordings of new Squeeze songs, their first studio recordings of new material in 14 years.

On 11 February 2013, Tilbrook and Difford performed a live cover of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Please Please Me&quot; on BBC Radio 2. They were joined by Paul Jones on harmonica. Alongside other contemporary artists, the performance was part of a 50th anniversary celebration of the original recording of the first Beatles album of the same name in the same period of time. A documentary of the recordings was shown by BBC Four on 15 February 2013.

Beginning in the autumn of 2014, Difford and Tilbrook began touring as a duo, playing Squeeze hits in smaller venues in the UK. Squeeze, still operating as a full band, also continued to play occasional festival shows through 2014 and 2015. In early 2015, Squeeze announced that bassist John Bentley would play his final gig with the band on 24 July. In an interview, Bentley announced his replacement will be Lucy Shaw (also the bassist for Tilbrook&#x27;s backing band The Fluffers), which was officially confirmed by Squeeze in August.

In 2016–2018 the band continued to tour, in the US, Australia and extensively in the UK.

====&quot;Cradle to the Grave&quot;====
From 2008 forward, Difford and Tilbrook repeatedly stated in interviews that they planned to produce an album of new Squeeze material; they alluded to this in on-camera interviews at V Festival in both 2008 and 2011. In January 2010, it was announced that they would be spending part of the coming summer in Italy together writing songs for a new Squeeze album, and in an interview on BBC Radio Wales on 10 November 2013, Tilbrook stated that Squeeze would be recording between January and March 2014. However these sessions never took place and Tilbrook ended up recording and releasing the solo album &quot;Happy Endings&quot;.

Around the same time, it was announced that Squeeze would be providing the music for a BBC drama called &quot;Cradle to Grave&quot;, based on the autobiography &quot;Going To Sea in a Sieve&quot; by Danny Baker. Squeeze debuted the song &quot;Cradle to the Grave&quot; on their 2013 tour, whilst Difford and Tilbrook were photographed with Danny Baker on the set of &quot;Cradle to the Grave&quot;.

Recording for the album finally got underway sometime in 2014/2015, and in April 2015, Difford announced on his Twitter feed that he had listened to a &quot;first mix&quot; of the new album. In July, Squeeze announced on their Facebook page that the album was entering the mastering stage. &quot;Cradle to the Grave&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album of original material since 1998 received its official release on 2 October 2015. A limited edition of 1000 copies were released through the band&#x27;s own Love Records at the end of August.

====Present activity====
Squeeze performed in front of David Cameron on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; in January 2016 and used the performance to protest against the then-Prime Minister by changing the lyrics to their song &quot;Cradle to the Grave&quot;.

In July 2017, the band announced a North American tour, along with two line-up changes: the replacement of Lucy Shaw as bassist with Yolanda Charles and the addition of Dirty Vegas frontman Steve Smith as percussionist and backing vocalist. The band also announced an Australian tour for 2018, and revealed that they were in the midst of recording a new album.

In August 2017, Squeeze revealed the title of their fifteenth studio album as &quot;The Knowledge&quot;. A new single, &quot;Innocence in Paradise&quot;, was released ahead of the album. &quot;The Knowledge&quot; was released on 13 October 2017.

The band has continued touring through the UK, Ireland and North America. A tour was announced on the official Squeeze website for 2020 in Australia and New Zealand, but was indefinitely postponed due to scheduling problems.

On 13 August 2019, the band officially announced the addition of a seventh member, guitarist Melvin Duffy. Duffy had played as a session musician on Squeeze&#x27;s previous two albums, and at occasional live shows.

In September 2019, Squeeze were joined at the Louisville, Kentucky Bourbon &amp; Beyond Festival by ex-Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters front-man Dave Grohl on drums, for a performance of the 1982 hit &quot;Black Coffee in Bed&quot;.

In February 2020, it was announced that Yolanda Charles had departed the band, and new bassist Sean Hurley (who had filled in for Charles on bass on a few 2019 dates, including the date Dave Grohl guested) would be replacing her. In April of that year, Tilbrook, while discussing an upcoming scheduled gig, mentioned that it would be the &quot;very first gig with our new bass player! A chap called Owen Biddle, who used to play in a band called The Roots.&quot; However, the show in question was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The new line-up of Squeeze, with Biddle permanently replacing Hurley, began touring in 2021.

In November 2022, in response to the United Kingdom cost of living crisis, the band announced that proceeds from their &quot;Food for Thought&quot; EP would be donated to food banks and asked fans attending their UK tour to bring donations for the Trussell Trust.

In September 2023 Tilbrook said that Squeeze intended to record their next two albums in Los Angeles, including one collection of new material and another consisting of previously unrecorded songs written in the band&#x27;s very earliest days.

On 8 June 2024 the band were special guests for Richard Thompson, on the final night of his UK tour, at the Royal Albert Hall.

== Style and influences ==
=== Style ===
Stylistically, Squeeze have been characterised as new wave, post-punk, pub rock and power pop. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of &quot;AllMusic&quot; proclaimed the band to provide &quot;one of the links between classic British guitar pop and post-punk&quot;. Squeeze have also been labelled as punk and pop punk. In a January 1988 interview by &quot;Music Connection&quot;, when addressing Squeeze being thought of as a punk band, Glenn Tilbrook commented &quot;I never thought that we were [a punk band] – although I thought we were influenced by it to a certain extent&quot;.

=== Influences ===
Squeeze were inspired by 1960s rock bands The Kinks and The Beatles, and the songwriting partnership of Difford and Tilbrook has attracted comparisons to that of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, a likening the band have expressed &quot;mixed feelings&quot; about. In addition, members of Squeeze have cited artists including David Bowie, Elvis Costello, Donovan, The Blockheads&#x27; Ian Dury, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, King Crimson and Greg Lake, Nick Lowe, Glenn Miller, Ramones, The Rolling Stones, the Velvet Underground and Lou Reed, and The Who as sources of influence or inspiration.

== Legacy and influence ==
Squeeze have been cited as an influence by several bands and artists. American new wave singer Marshall Crenshaw cited Squeeze as one of the primary influences for his 1982 self-titled debut album. College rock band the Replacements, particularly bassist Tommy Stinson, also professed an admiration for the band. Many artists in the Britpop genre also took influence from the band, particularly Blur, whose guitarist Graham Coxon called Squeeze an &quot;amazing band&quot; and named Tilbrook&#x27;s voice as &quot;one of my favourite ever English singing voices.&quot; Later artists who named Squeeze as an influence include American Hi-Fi, The Caulfields, Kasabian, the Killers, Nightmare of You, Razorlight, and Space.

Many bands and artists who would later achieve phenomenal success would begin their careers opening for Squeeze, including Dire Straits, The Jam, R.E.M., The Specials, U2 and XTC.

<doc id="66789" wikidata="Q47595" url="?curid=66789" title="Alfonso X of Castile">
<text>Alfonso Ferdinandez X (also known as the Wise, ; 23 November 1221 – 4 April 1284) was King of Castile, León and Galicia from 1 June 1252 until his death in 1284. During the election of 1257, a dissident faction chose him to be king of Germany on 1 April. He renounced his claim to Germany in 1275, and in creating an alliance with the Kingdom of England in 1254, his claim on the Duchy of Gascony as well.

Alfonso&#x27;s scientific interests—he is sometimes nicknamed the Astrologer (&quot;el Astrólogo&quot;)—led him to sponsor the creation of the Alfonsine tables, and the Alphonsus crater on the Moon is named after him. He also sponsored the work of historians who, for the first time since Isidore of Seville in , placed Spain in the context of world history. As a lawmaker he introduced the first vernacular law code in Castile, the &quot;Siete Partidas&quot;. He created the Mesta, an association of sheep farmers in the central plain, but debased the coinage to finance his claim to the German crown. He fought a successful war with Portugal, but a less successful one with Granada. The end of his reign was marred by a civil war with his eldest surviving son, the future Sancho IV, which continued after his death.

==Life==

===Early life===
Born 23 November 1221 in Toledo, Kingdom of Castile, Alfonso was the eldest son of Ferdinand III and Elizabeth (Beatrice) of Swabia. His mother was the paternal cousin of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, to whom Alfonso is often compared. His maternal grandparents were Philip of Swabia and Irene Angelina. Little is known about his upbringing, but he was most likely raised in Toledo. For the first nine years of his life Alfonso was only heir to Castile until his paternal grandfather king Alfonso IX of León died and his father united the kingdoms of Castile and León. He began his career as a soldier, under the command of his father, when he was sixteen years old.

After the accession of King Theobald I of Navarre, Ferdinand tried to arrange a marriage for Alfonso with Theobald&#x27;s daughter, Blanche, but the move was unsuccessful. At the same time, he had a romantic relationship with Mayor Guillén de Guzmán, who bore him a daughter, Beatrice.
In 1240, he married Mayor Guillén de Guzmán, but the marriage was later annulled and their issue declared illegitimate. In the same period (1240–1250) he conquered several Muslim strongholds in Al-Andalus alongside his father, such as Murcia, Alicante and Cádiz.

In 1249, Alfonso married Violant, the daughter of King James I of Aragon and Violant of Hungary, although betrothed already in 1246.

===Reign===

Alfonso succeeded his father as King of Castile and León in 1252. The following year he invaded Portugal, capturing the region of the Algarve. King Afonso III of Portugal had to surrender, but he gained an agreement by which, after he consented to marry Alfonso X&#x27;s daughter Beatrice of Castile, the land would be returned to their heirs. In 1261 he captured Jerez. In 1263 he returned Algarve to the King of Portugal and signed the Treaty of Badajoz (1267).

In 1254 Alfonso X signed a treaty of alliance with King Henry III of England, supporting him in the war against King Louis IX of France. In the same year Alfonso&#x27;s half-sister, Eleanor, married Henry&#x27;s son Edward: with this act Alfonso renounced forever all claim to the Duchy of Gascony, to which Castile had been a pretender since the marriage of Alfonso VIII of Castile with Eleanor of England.

====Imperial election====
In 1256, at the death of William II of Holland, Alfonso&#x27;s descent from the Hohenstaufen through his mother, a daughter of Philip of Swabia, gave him a claim through the Hohenstaufen line. Alfonso&#x27;s election as German king by the prince-electors misled him into complicated schemes that involved excessive expense but never succeeded. Alfonso never even traveled to Germany, and his alliance with the Italian Ghibelline Lord Ezzelino IV da Romano deprived him of the initial support of Pope Alexander IV. His rival, Richard of Cornwall, went to Germany and was crowned in 1257 at Aachen.

To obtain money, Alfonso debased the coinage and then endeavored to prevent a rise in prices by an arbitrary tariff. The little trade of his dominions was ruined, and the burghers and peasants were deeply offended. His nobles, whom he tried to cow by sporadic acts of violence, rebelled against him in 1272. Reconciliation was bought by Alfonso&#x27;s son Ferdinand in 1273.

In the end, after Richard&#x27;s death, the German princes elected Rudolph of Habsburg (1273), Alfonso being declared deposed by Pope Gregory X. In 1275 Alfonso tried to meet with his imperial vicar in Italy, William VII of Montferrat (who had succeeded Ezzelino) and his Ghibelline allies in Piedmont and Lombardy to celebrate the victory against the Guelph Charles I of Anjou and be crowned in Lombardy; he was however halted in his imperial ambitions in Provence by the Pope who, after a long negotiation, obtained Alfonso&#x27;s oral renunciation of any claims to the Holy Roman Empire.

====Civil war====

Throughout his reign, Alfonso contended with the nobles, particularly the families of Nuño González de Lara, Diego López de Haro and Esteban Fernández de Castro, all of whom were formidable soldiers and instrumental in maintaining Castile&#x27;s military strength in frontier territories. According to some scholars Alfonso lacked the singleness of purpose required by a ruler who would devote himself to organization and also the combination of firmness with temper needed for dealing with his nobles although this is not a view taken by all. Others have argued that his efforts were too singularly focused on the diplomatic and financial arrangements surrounding his bid to become Holy Roman Emperor.

Alfonso&#x27;s eldest son, Ferdinand, died in 1275 at the Battle of Écija against the Moroccan and Granadan invasion armies, leaving two infant sons. Alfonso&#x27;s second son, Sancho, claimed to be the new heir, in preference to the children of Ferdinand de la Cerda, basing his claim on an old Castilian custom, that of proximity of blood and agnatic seniority. Alfonso preferred to leave the throne to his grandsons, but Sancho had the support of the nobility. A bitter civil war broke out resulting in Alfonso&#x27;s being forced in 1282 to accept Sancho as his heir instead of his young grandsons; only the cities of Seville, Murcia and Badajoz remained faithful to him. Son and nobles alike supported the Moors when he tried to unite the nation in a crusade; and when he allied himself with Abu Yusuf Yakub, the ruling Marinid sultan of Morocco, they denounced him as an enemy of the faith. A reaction in his favor was beginning in his later days, but he died defeated and deserted at Seville in 1284, leaving a will, by which he endeavored to exclude Sancho, and a heritage of civil war.

====Economic policy====
In 1273, he created the Mesta, an association of some 3,000 petty and great sheep holders in Castile, in reaction to less wool being exported from the traditional sites in England. This organization later became exceedingly powerful in the country (as wool became Castile&#x27;s first major exportable commodity and reported a trade surplus, called &quot;white gold&quot;, as the wool amount was critical to the health of the population during the winter), and eventually its privileges were to prove a deadly wound in the Castilian economy. One side effect of the quickly expanding sheep herds was the decimation to the Castilian farmland through which the sheep grazed.

The original function of the Mesta was to separate the fields from the sheep-ways linking grazing areas.

====Legislative activity====
As a ruler, Alfonso showed legislative capacity, and a wish to provide the kingdoms expanded under his father with a code of laws and a consistent judicial system. The &quot;Fuero Real&quot; was undoubtedly his work. He began medieval Europe&#x27;s most comprehensive code of law, the &quot;Siete Partidas&quot;, which, however, thwarted by the nobility of Castile, was only promulgated by his great-grandson. Because of this, and because the &quot;Partidas&quot; remain fundamental law in the American Southwest, he is one of the 23 lawmakers depicted in the House of Representatives chamber of the United States Capitol.

====Military training====
From a young age Alfonso X showed an interest in military life and chivalry. In 1231 Alfonso traveled with Pérez de Castron on a military campaign in lower Andalusia. Writing in &quot;Estoria de España&quot;, Alfonso describes having seen St. James on a white horse with a white banner and a legion of knights fighting a war above the soldiers of Spain. This vision of a heavenly army fighting in Jerez and participation in military campaigns likely left Alfonso X with a high degree of knowledge and respect for military operations and chivalric knights. Alfonso&#x27;s respect for chivalry can also be seen in his writing of Spanish law. Spanish Chivalric conduct was codified in the (2,21) where he wrote that knights should be, &quot;of good linage and distinguished by gentility, wisdom, understanding, loyalty, courage, moderation, justice, prowess, and the practical knowledge necessary to assess the quality of horse and arms (, 21,1–10).&quot; These efforts to make a codified standard of chivalric conduct were likely meant to both encourage strength of arms (prowess) and to restrain the use of violence for only just (state-sponsored) usage.

==Court culture==

King Alfonso X developed a court culture that encouraged cosmopolitan learning. Alfonso had many works previously written in Arabic and Latin translated into vernacular Castilian in his court. Alfonso &quot;turned to the vernacular for the kind of intellectual commitments that formerly were inconceivable outside Latin.&quot; He is credited with encouraging the extensive written use of the Castilian language instead of Latin as the language used in courts, churches, and in books and official documents (although his father, Ferdinand III, had begun to use it for some documents). This translation of Arabic and Classic documents into vernacular encouraged the development of Spanish sciences, literature, and philosophy.

===Translations===
From the beginning of his reign, Alfonso employed Jewish, Christian and Muslim scholars at his court, primarily for the purpose of translating books from Arabic and Hebrew into Latin and Castilian, although he always insisted on personally supervising the translations. This group of scholars formed his royal scriptorium, continuing the tradition of the twelfth-century Escuela de Traductores de Toledo (Toledo School of Translators). Their final output promoted Castilian as a learning language both in science and literature, and established the foundations of the new Spanish language. This evolved version of the Castilian language also acquired significant relevance in the royal chancery, where it came to replace Latin, which until then had been the language commonly used for royal diplomacy in Castile and León.

The very first translation, commissioned by his brother, Fernando de la Cerda—who had extensive experience, both diplomatic and military, among the Muslims of southern Iberia and north Africa—was a Castilian version of the animal fable &quot;Kalila wa-Dimna&quot;, a book that belongs to the genre of wisdom literature labeled Mirrors for Princes: stories and sayings meant to instruct the monarch in proper and effective governance.

The primary intellectual work of these scholars centered on astronomy and astrology. The early period of Alfonso&#x27;s reign saw the translation of selected works of magic (&quot;Lapidario&quot;, &quot;Picatrix&quot;, &quot;Libro de las formas et las ymagenes&quot;) all translated by a Jewish scholar named Yehuda ben Moshe (Yhuda Mosca, in the Old Spanish source texts). These were all highly ornate manuscripts (only the &quot;Lapidario&quot; survives in its entirety) containing what was believed to be secret knowledge on the magical properties of stones and talismans. In addition to these books of astral magic, Alfonso ordered the translation of well-known Arabic astrological compendia, including the &quot;Libro de las cruzes&quot; and &quot;Libro conplido en los iudizios de las estrellas&quot;. The first of these was, ironically, translated from Latin (it was used among the Visigoths), into Arabic, and then back into Castilian and Latin. Most of the texts first translated at this time survive in only one manuscript each.

===Astronomy===

As an intellectual he gained considerable scientific fame based on his encouragement of astronomy, which included astrology at the time and the Ptolemaic cosmology as known to him through the Arabs. He surrounded himself with mostly Jewish translators who rendered Arabic scientific texts into Castilian at Toledo. His fame extends to the preparation of the Alfonsine tables, based on calculations of al-Zarqali, &quot;Arzachel&quot;. Alexander Bogdanov maintained that these tables formed the basis for Copernicus&#x27;s development of a heliocentric understanding in astronomy.
Because of this work, the lunar crater Alphonsus is named after him. One famous, but apocryphal, quote attributed to him upon his hearing an explanation of the extremely complicated mathematics required to demonstrate Ptolemy&#x27;s theory of astronomy was &quot;If the Lord Almighty had consulted me before embarking on creation thus, I should have recommended something simpler.&quot; Gingerich (1990) says that a form of this alleged quotation was mentioned (but rejected) as early as the 16th century by the historian Jerónimo de Zurita, and that Soriano Viguera (1926) states that &quot;nothing of the sort can be found in Alfonso&#x27;s writings.&quot; Nevertheless, Dean Acheson (U.S. Secretary of State, 1949–1953) used it as the basis for the title and epigraph of his memoir &quot;Present at the Creation.&quot;

===Chronicles===
Alfonso also commissioned a compilation of chronicles, the &quot;Crónica general&quot;, completed in 1264. This chronicle sought to establish a general history and drew from older chronicles, folklore and Arabic sources. This work enjoyed renewed popularity starting in the sixteenth century, when there was a revival of interest in history; Florián de Ocampo published a new edition and Lorenzo de Sepúlveda used it as the chief source of his popular romances. Sepúlveda wrote a number of romances having Alfonso X as their hero.

===Historical works===
Alfonso&#x27;s court compiled in Castilian a work titled &quot;General Estoria&quot;. This work was an attempt at a world history that drew from many sources and included translations from the Vulgate Old Testament mixed with myths and histories from the classical world, mostly Egypt, Greece, and Rome. This world history was left incomplete, however, and so it stops at the birth of Christ. The main significance of this work lies in the translations from Latin into Castilian. Much like his chronicles, the ability of Alfonso&#x27;s court to compile writings from a variety of cultures and translate them into Castilian left a historic impact on Spain.

Alfonso X is credited with the first depiction of an &quot;hórreo&quot;, a typical granary from the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The oldest document containing an image of an &quot;hórreo&quot; is Alfonso&#x27;s &quot;Cantigas de Santa Maria&quot; (song CLXXXVII) from XII A.C. In this depiction, three rectangular &quot;hórreos&quot; of Gothic style are illustrated.

===Games===

Alfonso also had the &quot;Libro de ajedrez, dados, y tablas&quot; (&quot;&quot;Libro de los Juegos&quot; (The Book of Games)&quot;) translated into Castilian from Arabic and added illustrations with the goal of perfecting the work. It was completed in 1283. The Libro de juegos contains an extensive collection of writings on chess, with over 100 chess problems and chess variants.

===Music===
Alfonso X commissioned or co-authored numerous works of music during his reign. These works included &quot;Cantigas d&#x27;escarnio e maldicer&quot; and the vast compilation &quot;Cantigas de Santa Maria&quot; (&quot;Songs to the Virgin Mary&quot;), which was written in GalicianPortuguese and figures among the most important of his works. The &quot;Cantigas de Santa Maria&quot; form one of the largest collections of vernacular monophonic songs to survive from the Middle Ages. They consist of 420 poems with musical notation. The poems are for the most part on miracles attributed to the Virgin Mary. One of the miracles Alfonso relates is his own healing in Puerto de Santa María.

==Family==
Violante was twelve or thirteen years old at the time of her marriage to Alfonso; she produced no children for several years and it was feared that she was barren. Alfonso almost had their marriage annulled, but they went on to have eleven children:

<text>Specific phobia is an anxiety disorder, characterized by an extreme, unreasonable, and irrational fear associated with a specific object, situation, or concept which poses little or no actual danger. Specific phobia can lead to avoidance of the object or situation, persistence of the fear, and significant distress or problems functioning associated with the fear. A phobia can be the fear of anything.

Although fears are common and normal, a phobia is an extreme type of fear where great lengths are taken to avoid being exposed to the particular danger. Phobias are considered the most common psychiatric disorder, affecting about 10% of the population in the US, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), (among children, 5%; among teens, 16%). About 75% of patients have more than one specific phobia.

It can be described as when patients are anxious about a particular situation. It causes a great load of difficulty in life. Patients have a lot of distress or interference when functioning in their daily life. Unreasonable or irrational fears get in the way of daily routines, work, and relationships due to the effort that a patient makes to avoid the terrifying feelings associated with the fear.

Females are twice as likely to be diagnosed than males with a specific phobia (although this can depend on the stimulus).

Children and adolescents who are diagnosed with a specific phobia are at an increased risk for additional psychopathology later in life.

==Signs and symptoms==
Fear, discomfort or anxiety may be triggered both by the presence and the anticipation of the specific object or situation. The main behavioral sign of a specific phobia is avoidance. The fear or anxiety associated with specific phobia can also manifest in physical symptoms such as an increased heart rate, shortness of breath, muscle tension, sweating, or a desire to escape the situation.

== Causes ==
The exact cause of specific phobias is not known. The mechanisms for development of specific phobias can be distinguished between innate (genetic and neurobiological) factors, and learned factors. 

In neurobiology, one explanation proposed for specific phobia is that the typical activation of the amygdala in response to stimuli may be exaggerated due to pathological changes. According to this theory, a deficiency in amygdala habituation may also contribute to the persistence of non-experiential phobia. Certain phobias that are less lethal (e.g. dogs) seem to be more frequently observed and easily acquired in comparison to potentially lethal fears which are more relevant to developed human society (e.g. cars and guns). This was theorised to be due to biological adaptation being passed through evolution which makes recent threats less prone to easy acquisition. However, a 2014 study found evidence against this evolutionary theory, which stated: &quot;Our findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that fears/phobias of individual stimuli result from genetic and environmental factors unique to that stimulus. Instead, we observed substantial sharing of risk factors across individual fears.&quot; There is also evidence for the validity of a genetic component contributing to blood-injection-injury phobias and animal phobias, although this evidence did not support the idea that other specific phobias had genetic influence. Blood-injection-injury phobias are also believed to be the most heritable among specific phobias.

The classical conditioning model of learning has also been used to suggest that a phobia will be learned when an event that causes a fear or anxiety reaction is paired with a neutral event. An example of this model is when being near a dog (neutral event) is paired with the emotional experience of being bitten by a dog, resulting in a chronic fear which is described as a specific phobia to dogs. An alternative proposed mechanism of association is through observational learning. According to this theory, a person may internalize another person&#x27;s fears about a specific object or situation through observation of their reactions.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis in the ICD or the DSM requires a marked fear, anxiety or avoidance that is long-lasting (greater than six months) and consistently occurs in the presence of the feared object or situation. The DSM-5 that the fears should be out of proportion to the danger posed, compared to the ICD-10 which specifies that the symptoms must be excessive or unreasonable. Minor differences have persisted between the ICD-11 and DSM-5.

In the DSM-5, there are several types which specific phobia can be classified under:
* Animal type – Including fear of spiders (arachnophobia), insects (entomophobia), dogs (cynophobia), or snakes (ophidiophobia).
* Natural environment type – Including fear of water (aquaphobia), heights (acrophobia), lightning and thunderstorms (astraphobia), or aging (gerascophobia).
* Situational type – Including the fear of small confined spaces (claustrophobia), or the dark (nyctophobia).
* Blood/injection/injury type – Including fear of medical procedures, including needles and injections (trypanophobia), fear of blood (hemophobia) and fear of getting injured (traumatophobia).
* Other – Situations which can lead to choking or vomiting, and children&#x27;s fears of loud sounds or costumed characters.
Although the avoidance resulting from specific phobia is comparable to other anxiety disorders, differential diagnosis is done through examining underlying causes for the behavior. Agoraphobia is also considered distinct from specific phobia, along with substance use disorders, and avoidant personality disorder. The occurrence of panic attacks is not itself a symptom of specific phobias and falls under the criteria of panic disorder.

==Treatment==
There are a variety of treatment options available for specific phobias, most of which focus on psychosocial interventions. Different psychological treatments have varying levels of effects depending on the specific phobia being addressed.

=== Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) ===

Cognitive behavioral therapy is a short term, skills-focused therapy that aims to help people diffuse unhelpful emotional responses by helping people consider them differently or change their behavior. CBT represents the gold standard and first line of therapy in specific phobias. CBT is effective in treating specific phobias primarily through exposure and cognitive strategies to overcome a person&#x27;s anxiety. Computer-assisted treatment programs, self-help manuals, and delivery by a trained practitioner are all methods of accessing CBT. A single session of CBT in one of these modalities can be effective for individuals who have a specific phobia.

=== Exposure therapy ===

Exposure therapy is a particularly effective form of CBT for many specific phobias, however, treatment acceptance and high drop-out rates have been noted as concerns. In addition, a third of people who complete exposure therapy as a treatment for specific phobia may not respond, regardless of the type of exposure therapy. Other interventions have been successful for particular types of specific phobia, such as virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for spider, dental, and height phobias, applied muscle tension (AMT) for needle phobia, and psychoeducation with relaxation exercises for fear of childbirth. With exposure therapy, a type of cognitive-behavioural therapy, clinically significant improvement was experienced by up to 90% of patients. While very long-term outcomes remain unknown, many of the benefits of exposure therapy persisted after one year. Treatment may be more successful at reducing symptoms in people with low trait anxiety, high motivation, and high self-efficacy entering exposure therapy. In addition, high cortisol levels, high heart rate variation, evoking disgust, avoiding relaxation, focusing on cognitive changes, context variation, sleep, and memory-enhancing drugs can also reduce symptoms following exposure therapy.

Exposure can be &quot;live&quot;(in real life) or imaginal (in ones imagination) and can involve:
* &quot;Systematic desensitization&quot;—A therapy that exposes the person to increasing levels of vivid stimuli gradually and frequently, while instructed to relax.
* &quot;Flooding&quot;—A therapy that exposes the person with a specific phobia to the most fearful stimulus first (i.e. the most intense part of the phobia). Patients are at great risk for dropping out of treatment as this method repeatedly exposes the patient to the fear.
* &quot;Modeling&quot;—This method includes the clinician approaching the feared stimuli while the patient observes and tries to repeat the approach themselves.
Exposures that are imaginal are less effective.

Specifically for acrophobia, in-vivo exposure (exposure to real-world height-scenarios while maintaining anxiety at controlled levels) has been shown to significantly improve measures of anxiety in the short-term, but this effect decreased over a longer term. Likewise, virtual reality exposure was statistically significant in some measures of anxiety reduction, but not others.

=== Pharmacotherapeutics ===
As of late 2020, there is limited evidence for the use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of specific phobia. Pharmacological treatments are typically used in combination with behaviorally-focused psychotherapy, as introducing pharmacological interventions independently may result in relapsing of symptoms. Different treatments are better suited for certain types of specific phobia. For instance, beta blockers are useful in those with performance anxiety. The selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), paroxetine and escitalopram, have shown preliminary efficacy in small randomized controlled clinical trials. However, these trials were too small to show any definitive benefits of anxiolytic medication alone in treating phobia. Benzodiazepines are occasionally used for acute symptom relief, but have not been shown to be effective for long-term treatment. There are some findings suggesting that adjuvant use of the NMDA receptor partial agonist, d-cycloserine, with virtual reality exposure therapy may improve specific phobia symptoms more than virtual reality exposure therapy alone. As of 2020, studies on the use of adjunct d-cycloserine are inconclusive.

== Prognosis ==
The majority of those that develop a specific phobia first experience symptoms in childhood. Often individuals will experience symptoms periodically with periods of remission before complete remission occurs. However, specific phobias that continue into adulthood are likely to experience a more chronic course. Specific phobias in older adults has been linked with a decrease in quality of life. Those with specific phobias are at an increased risk of suicide. Greater impairment is found in those that have multiple phobias. Response to treatment is relatively high but many do not seek treatment due to lack of access, ability to avoid phobia, or unwilling to face feared object for repeated CBT sessions.

==Epidemiology==

Specific phobia is estimated to affect 6–12% of people at some point in their life. There may be a large amount of underreporting of specific phobias as many people do not seek treatment, with some surveys conducted in the US finding that 70% of the population reports having one or more unreasonable fears.

Specific phobias have a lifetime prevalence rate of 7.4% and a one-year prevalence of 5.5% according to data collected from 22 different countries. The usual age of onset is childhood to adolescence. During childhood and adolescence, the incidence of new specific phobias is much higher in females than males. The peak incidence for specific phobias amongst females occurs during reproduction and childrearing, possibly reflecting an evolutionary advantage. There is an additional peak in incidence, reaching nearly 1% per year, during old age in both men and women, possibly reflective of newly occurring physical conditions or adverse life events. The development of phobias varies with subtypes, with animal and blood injection phobias typically beginning in childhood (ages 5–12), whereas development of situational specific phobias (i.e., fear of flying) usually occurs in late adolescence and early adulthood.

In the US, the lifetime prevalence rate is 12.5% and a one-year prevalence rate of 9.1%. An estimated 12.5% of U.S. adults experience specific phobia at some time in their lives and the prevalence is approximately double in females compared to males. An estimated 19.3% of adolescents experience specific phobia, but the difference between males and females is not as pronounced.

<doc id="66793" wikidata="Q1198419" url="?curid=66793" title="Tetrahymena">
<text>Tetrahymena is a genus of free-living ciliates, examples of unicellular eukaryotes. The genus Tetrahymena is the most widely studied member of its phylum. It can produce, store and react with different types of hormones. Tetrahymena cells can recognize both related and hostile cells.

They can also switch from commensalistic to pathogenic modes of survival. They are common in freshwater lakes, ponds, and streams.

&quot;Tetrahymena&quot; species used as model organisms in biomedical research are &quot;T. thermophila&quot; and &quot;T. pyriformis&quot;.

== &quot;T. thermophila&quot;: a model organism in experimental biology ==
As a ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena thermophila exhibits nuclear dimorphism: two types of cell nuclei. They have a bigger, non-germline macronucleus and a small, germline micronucleus in each cell at the same time and these two carry out different functions with distinct cytological and biological properties. This unique versatility allows scientists to use &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; to identify several key factors regarding gene expression and genome integrity. In addition, &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; possess hundreds of cilia and has complicated microtubule structures, making it an optimal model to illustrate the diversity and functions of microtubule arrays.

Because &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; can be grown in a large quantity in the laboratory with ease, it has been a great source for biochemical analysis for years, specifically for enzymatic activities and purification of sub-cellular components. In addition, with the advancement of genetic techniques it has become an excellent model to study the gene function &quot;in vivo&quot;. The recent sequencing of the macronucleus genome should ensure that &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; will be continuously used as a model system.

&quot;Tetrahymena thermophila&quot; exists in seven different sexes (mating types) that can reproduce in 21 different combinations, and a single tetrahymena cannot reproduce sexually with itself. Each organism &quot;decides&quot; which sex it will become during mating, through a stochastic process.

Studies on &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; have contributed to several scientific milestones including:
# First cell which showed synchronized division, which led to the first insights into the existence of mechanisms which control the cell cycle.
# Identification and purification of the first cytoskeleton based motor protein such as &quot;dynein&quot;.
# Aid in the discovery of &quot;lysosomes&quot; and &quot;peroxisomes&quot;.
# Early molecular identification of somatic genome rearrangement.
# Discovery of the molecular structure of &quot;telomeres&quot;, &quot;telomerase&quot; enzyme, the templating role of telomerase RNA and their roles in cellular senescence and chromosome healing (for which a Nobel Prize was won).
# Nobel Prize–winning co-discovery (1989, in Chemistry) of catalytic RNA (&quot;ribozyme&quot;).
# Discovery of the function of histone acetylation.
# Demonstration of the roles of posttranslational modification such as acetylation and glycylation on tubulins and discovery of the enzymes responsible for some of these modifications (glutamylation)
# Crystal structure of 40S ribosome in complex with its initiation factor eIF1
# First demonstration that two of the &quot;universal&quot; stop codons, UAA and UAG, code for the amino acid glutamine in some eukaryotes, leaving UGA as the only termination codon in these organisms.


==Life cycle==
The life cycle of &quot;T. thermophila&quot; consists of an alternation between asexual and sexual stages. In nutrient rich media during vegetative growth cells reproduce asexually by binary fission. This type of cell division occurs by a sequence of morphogenetic events that results in the development of duplicate sets of cell structures, one for each daughter cell. Only during starvation conditions will cells commit to sexual conjugation, pairing and fusing with a cell of opposite mating type. Tetrahymena has seven mating types; each of which can mate with any of the other six without preference, but not its own.

Typical of ciliates, &quot;T. thermophila&quot; differentiates its genome into two functionally distinct types of nuclei, each specifically used during the two different stages of the life cycle. The diploid germline micronucleus is transcriptionally silent and only plays a role during sexual life stages. The germline nucleus contains 5 pairs of chromosomes which encode the heritable information passed down from one sexual generation to the next. During sexual conjugation, haploid micronuclear meiotic products from both parental cells fuse, leading to the creation of a new micro- and macronucleus in progeny cells. Sexual conjugation occurs when cells starved for at least 2hrs in a nutrient-depleted media encounter a cell of complementary mating type. After a brief period of co-stimulation (~1hr), starved cells begin to pair at their anterior ends to form a specialized region of membrane called the conjugation junction.

It is at this junctional zone that several hundred fusion pores form, allowing for the mutual exchange of protein, RNA and eventually a meiotic product of their micronucleus. This whole process takes about 12 hours at 30 °C, but even longer than this at cooler temperatures. The sequence of events during conjugation is outlined in the accompanying figure.

The larger polyploid macronucleus is transcriptionally active, meaning its genes are actively expressed, and so it controls somatic cell functions during vegetative growth. The polyploid nature of the macronucleus refers to the fact that it contains approximately 200–300 autonomously replicating linear DNA mini-chromosomes. These minichromosomes have their own telomeres and are derived via site-specific fragmentation of the five original micronuclear chromosomes during sexual development. In T. thermophila each of these minichromosomes encodes multiple genes and exists at a copy number of approximately 45-50 within the macronucleus. The exception to this is the minichromosome encoding the rDNA, which is massively upregulated, existing at a copy number of approximately 10,000 within the macronucleus. Because the macronucleus divides amitotically during binary fission, these minichromosomes are un-equally divided between the clonal daughter cells. Through natural or artificial selection, this method of DNA partitioning in the somatic genome can lead to clonal cell lines with different macronuclear phenotypes fixed for a particular trait, in a process called phenotypic assortment. In this way, the polyploid genome can fine-tune its adaptation to environmental conditions through gain of beneficial mutations on any given mini-chromosome whose replication is then selected for, or conversely, loss of a minichromosome which accrues a negative mutation. However, the macronucleus is only propagated from one cell to the next during the asexual, vegetative stage of the life cycle, and so it is never directly inherited by sexual progeny. Only beneficial mutations that occur in the germline micronucleus of &quot;T. thermophila&quot; are passed down between generations, but these mutations would never be selected for environmentally in the parental cells because they are not expressed.

== Behavior ==
Free swimming cells of &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; are attracted to certain chemicals by chemokinesis. The major chemo-attractants are peptides and/or proteins.

A 2016 study found that cultured &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; have the capacity to &#x27;learn&#x27; the shape and size of their swimming space. Cells confined in a droplet of a water for a short time were, upon release, found to repeat the circular swimming trajectories &#x27;learned&#x27; in the droplet. The diameter and duration of these swimming paths reflected the size of the droplet and time allowed to adapt.

==DNA repair==

It is common among protists that the sexual cycle is inducible by stressful conditions such as starvation. Such conditions often cause DNA damage. A central feature of meiosis is homologous recombination between non-sister chromosomes. In &quot;T. thermophila&quot; this process of meiotic recombination may be beneficial for repairing DNA damages caused by starvation.

Exposure of &quot;T. thermophila&quot; to UV light resulted in a greater than 100-fold increase in &quot;Rad51&quot; gene expression. Treatment with the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate also resulted in substantially elevated Rad 51 protein levels. These findings suggest that ciliates such as &quot;T. thermophila&quot; utilize a Rad51-dependent recombinational pathway to repair damaged DNA.

The Rad51 recombinase of &quot;T. thermophila&quot; is a homolog of the &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; RecA recombinase. In &quot;T. thermophila&quot;, Rad51 participates in homologous recombination during mitosis, meiosis and in the repair of double-strand breaks. During conjugation, Rad51 is necessary for completion of meiosis. Meiosis in &quot;T. thermophila&quot; appears to employ a Mus81-dependent pathway that does not use a synaptonemal complex and is considered secondary in most other model eukaryotes. This pathway includes the Mus81 resolvase and the Sgs1 helicase. The Sgs1 helicase appears to promote the non-crossover outcome of meiotic recombinational repair of DNA, a pathway that generates little genetic variation.

== Phenotypic and genotypic plasticity ==
Many species of &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; are known to display unique response mechanisms to stress and various environmental pressures. The unique genomic architecture of the ciliates (presence of a MIC, high ploidy, large number of chromosomes, etc.) allows for differential gene expression, as well as increased genomic flexibility. The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of phenotypic and genotypic plasticity in the Tetrahymena genus.

=== Inducible trophic polymorphisms ===
&quot;T. vorax&quot; is known for its inducible trophic polymorphisms, an ecologically offensive tactic that allows it to change its feeding strategy and diet by altering its morphology. Normally, &quot;T. vorax&quot; is a bacterivorous microstome around 60 μm in length. However, it has the ability to switch into a carnivorous macrostome around 200 μm in length that can feed on larger competitors. If &quot;T. vorax&quot; cells are too nutrient starved to undertake transformation, they have also been recorded as transforming into a third &quot;tailed&quot;-microstome morph, thought to be a defense mechanism in response to cannibalistic pressure. While &quot;T. vorax&quot; is the most well studied &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; that exhibits inducible trophic polymorphisms, many lesser known species are able to undertake transformation as well, including &quot;T. paulina&quot; and &quot;T. paravorax&quot;. However, only &quot;T. vorax&quot; has been recorded as having both a macrostome and tailed-microstome form.

These morphological switches are triggered by an abundance of stomatin in the environment, a mixture of metabolic compounds released by competitor species, such as &quot;Paramecium&quot;, &quot;Colpidium&quot;, and other &quot;Tetrahymena&quot;. Specifically, chromatographic analysis has revealed that ferrous iron, hypoxanthine, and uracil are the chemicals in stomatin responsible for triggering the morphological change. Many researchers cite &quot;starvation conditions&quot; as inducing the transformation, as in nature, the compound inducers are in highest concentration after microstomal ciliates have grazed down bacterial populations, and ciliate populations are high. When the chemical inducers are in high concentration, &quot;T. vorax&quot; cells will transform at higher rates, allowing them to prey on their former trophic competitors.

The exact genetic, and structural mechanisms that underlie &quot;T. vorax&quot; transformation are unknown. However, some progress has been made in identifying candidate genes. Researchers from the University of Alabama have used cDNA subtraction to remove actively transcribed DNA from microstome and macrostome &quot;T. vorax&quot; cells, leaving only differentially transcribed cDNA molecules. While nine differentiation-specific genes were found, the most frequently expressed candidate gene was identified as a novel sequence, &quot;SUBII-TG&quot;.

The sequenced region of &quot;SUBII-TG&quot; was 912 bp long and consists of three largely identical 105 bp open-reading frames. A northern blot analysis revealed that low levels of transcription are detected in microstome cells, while high levels of transcription occur in macrostome cells. Furthermore, when the researchers limited &quot;SUBII-TG&quot; expression in the presence of stomatin (using antisense oligonucleotide methods), a 55% reduction in &quot;SUBII-TG&quot; mRNA correlated with a 51% decrease in transformation, supporting the notion that the gene is at least partially responsible for controlling the transformation in &quot;T. vorax&quot;. However, very little is known about the &quot;SUBII-TG&quot; gene. Researchers were only able to sequence a portion of the entire open-reading frame, and other candidate genes have not been investigated thoroughly. mRNA and amino acid sequencing indicate that ubiquitin may play a crucial role in allowing transformation to take place as well. However, no known genes in the ubiquitin family have been identified in &quot;T. vorax&quot;. Finally, the genetic mechanisms of the &quot;tailed&quot; microstome morph are completely unknown.

=== Metal resistance, gene and genome amplification ===
Other related species exhibit their own unique responses to various stressors. In &quot;T. thermophila&quot;, chromosome amplification and gene expansion are inducible responses to common organometallic pollutants such as cadmium, copper, and lead. Strains of &quot;T. thermophila&quot; that were exposed to large quantities of Cd2+ over time were found to have a 5-fold increase of &quot;MTT1&quot;, and &quot;MTT3&quot; (metallothionein genes that code for Cadmium and Lead binding proteins) as well as &quot;CNBDP&quot;, an unrelated gene that lies just upstream of &quot;MTT1&quot; on the same chromosome. The fact that a non-metallothionein gene on the same locus as &quot;MTT1&quot; and &quot;MTT3&quot; increased copy number indicates that the entire chromosome had been amplified, as opposed to just specific genes. &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; species are 45-ploid for their macronucleus, meaning that the wild type of &quot;T. thermophila&quot; normally contains 45 copies of each chromosome. While the actual number of unique chromosomes are unknown, the number is thought to be around 187 in the MAC, and 5 in the MIC. Thus, the Ca2+ adapted strain contained 225 copies of the specific chromosome in question. This resulted in a nearly 28-fold increase in detected expression levels of &quot;MTT1&quot;, and slightly less in &quot;MTT3&quot;.

When researchers grew a sample of the &quot;T. thermophila&quot; population in normal growth medium (lacking Cd2+) for one month, the number of &quot;MTT1&quot;, &quot;MTT3&quot;, and &quot;CNBDP&quot; genes decreased to an average of three copies (135C). By seven months in normal growth medium, the &quot;T. thermophila&quot; cells were found reduced to just the wild type copy number (45C). When researchers returned cells from the same colony to Cd2+ medium, within a week &quot;MTT1&quot;, &quot;MTT3&quot;, and &quot;CNBDP&quot; genes increased to three copies once again (135C). Thus, the authors argue that chromosome amplification is an inducible and reversible mechanism in the &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; genetic response to metal stress.  

Researchers also used gene-knockdown experiments, where the copy number of another metallothionein gene on a different chromosome, &quot;MTT5&quot;, was dramatically reduced. Within a week, the new strain was found to have developed four novel genes from at least one duplication of &quot;MTT1&quot;. However, chromosome duplication had not taken place, as indicated by the wild-type ploidy and the normal quantity of other genes on the same chromosomes. Rather, researchers believe that the duplication resulted from homologous recombination events, producing transcriptionally active, upregulated genes that carry repeated &quot;MTT1&quot;.

=== Enhanced motility and dispersal ===
&quot;T. thermophila&quot; also undergoes phenotypic changes when faced with limited resource availability. Cells are capable of changing their shape and size, along with behavioral swimming strategies in response to starvation. The more motile cells that change in response to starvation are known as dispersers, or disperser cells. While rates and levels of phenotypic change differ between strains, disperser cells form in nearly all strains of &quot;T. thermophila&quot; when faced with starvation. Dispersers, and non-dispersing cells both become dramatically thinner and smaller, increasing the basal body and cilia density, allowing them to swim between two and three times faster than normal cells. Some strains of &quot;T. thermophila&quot; have also been found to develop a single, non-beating, enlarged cilia that assists the cell in steering or directing movement. While the behavior has been shown to correlate with faster dispersal and form as a reversible trait in &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; cells, little is known about the genetic or cellular mechanisms that allow for its development. Furthermore, other studies show that when genetically variable populations of &quot;T. thermophila&quot; were starved, dispersal cells actually increased in cell length, despite still becoming thinner. More research is needed to determine the genetic mechanisms that underlie disperser formation.

<doc id="66795" wikidata="Q209617" url="?curid=66795" title="Jean-Bertrand Aristide">
<text>Jean-Bertrand Aristide (; born 15 July 1953) is a Haitian former Salesian priest and politician who became Haiti&#x27;s first democratically elected president in 1991 before being deposed in a coup d&#x27;état. As a priest, he taught liberation theology and, as president, he attempted to normalize Afro-Creole culture, including Vodou religion, in Haiti. 

Aristide was appointed to a parish in Port-au-Prince in 1982 after completing his studies to become a priest. He became a focal point for the pro-democracy movement, first under Jean-Claude &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier and then under the military transition regime which followed. He won the 1990–91 Haitian presidential election with 67% of the vote but was ousted just months later in the September 1991 military coup. The coup regime collapsed in 1994 under U.S. pressure and threat of force (Operation Uphold Democracy), and Aristide was president again from 1994 to 1996 and from 2001 to 2004. 

Aristide was ousted again in a 2004 coup d&#x27;état after right-wing ex-army paramilitary units invaded the country from across the Dominican border. Aristide and many others have alleged that the United States had a role in orchestrating the second coup against him. In 2022, numerous Haitian and French officials told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that France and the United States had effectively overthrown Aristide by pressuring him to step down, though this was denied by James Foley, U.S. Ambassador to Haiti at the time of the coup.

After the second coup against him, Aristide went into exile in the Central African Republic and South Africa. He returned to Haiti in 2011 after seven years in exile.

== Background and church vocation ==
Jean-Bertrand Aristide was born into poverty in Port-Salut, Sud on 15 July 1953. His father died three months after Aristide was born, and he later moved to Port-au-Prince with his mother. At age five, Aristide started school with priests of the Salesian order. He was educated at the Collège Notre-Dame in Cap-Haïtien, graduating with honors in 1974. He then took a course of novitiate studies in La Vega, Dominican Republic, before returning to Haiti to study philosophy at the Grand Séminaire Notre Dame and psychology at the State University of Haiti.

After completing his post-graduate studies in 1979, Aristide travelled in Europe, studying in Italy, Greece, and at the Cremisan Monastery in the town of Beit Jala. He returned to Haiti in 1982 for his ordination as a Salesian priest, and was appointed curate of a small parish in Port-au-Prince.

Between 1957 and 1986, Haiti was ruled by the family dictatorships of François &quot;Papa Doc&quot; and Jean-Claude &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier. The misery endured by Haiti&#x27;s poor made a deep impression on Aristide himself, and he became an outspoken critic of Duvalierism. Nor did he spare the hierarchy of the country&#x27;s church, since a 1966 Vatican Concordat granted Duvalier one-time power to appoint Haiti&#x27;s bishops. An exponent of liberation theology, Aristide denounced Duvalier&#x27;s regime in one of his earliest sermons. This did not go unnoticed by the regime&#x27;s top echelons. Under pressure, the provincial delegate of the Salesian Order sent Aristide into three years of exile in Montreal. By 1985, as popular opposition to Duvalier&#x27;s regime grew, Aristide was back preaching in Haiti. His Easter Week sermon, &quot;A call to holiness&quot;, delivered at the cathedral of Port-au-Prince and later broadcast throughout Haiti, proclaimed: &quot;The path of those Haitians who reject the regime is the path of righteousness and love.&quot;

Aristide became a leading figure in the Ti Legliz movement, whose name means &quot;little church&quot; in Kreyòl. In September 1985, he was appointed to St. Jean Bosco church, in a poor neighborhood in Port-au-Prince. Struck by the absence of young people in the church, Aristide began to organize youth, sponsoring weekly youth Masses. He founded an orphanage for urban street children in 1986 called &quot;Lafanmi Selavi&quot; [Family is Life]. The program sought to be a model of participatory democracy for the children it served. As Aristide became a leading voice for the aspirations of Haiti&#x27;s dispossessed, he inevitably became a target for attack. He survived at least four assassination attempts. The most widely publicized attempt, the St. Jean Bosco massacre, occurred on 11 September 1988, During the attempt over one hundred armed Tontons Macoute wearing red armbands forced their way into St. Jean Bosco as Aristide began Sunday Mass. As army troops and police stood by, the men fired machine guns at the congregation and attacked fleeing parishioners with machetes. Aristide&#x27;s church was burned to the ground. Thirteen people are reported to have been killed, and 77 wounded. Aristide survived and went into hiding.

Subsequently, Salesian officials ordered Aristide to leave Haiti, but tens of thousands of Haitians protested, blocking his access to the airport. In December 1988, Aristide was expelled from his Salesian order. A statement prepared by the Salesians called the priest&#x27;s political activities an &quot;incitement to hatred and violence&quot;, out of line with his role as a clergyman. Aristide appealed the decision, saying: &quot;The crime of which I stand accused is the crime of preaching food for all men and women.&quot; In a January 1988 interview, he said &quot;The solution is revolution, first in the spirit of the Gospel; Jesus could not accept people going hungry. It is a conflict between classes, rich and poor. My role is to preach and organize...&quot; In 1994, Aristide left priesthood, ending years of tension with the church over his criticism of its hierarchy and his espousal of liberation theology. Aristide married Mildred Trouillot, on 20 January 1996, with whom he had two daughters.

== First presidency (1991–96) ==

Following the violence at the aborted national election of 1987, the 1990 election was approached with caution. Aristide announced his candidacy for the presidency. Following a six-week campaign, during which he dubbed his followers the &quot;&quot; (National Front for Change and Democracy, or FNCD), Aristide was elected president in 1990 with 67% of the vote in what is generally recognized as the first honest election in Haitian history. However, just eight months into his presidency he was overthrown by a bloody military coup. He broke from FNCD and created the Struggling People&#x27;s Organization (OPL, Organisation Politique &quot;Lavalas&quot;) – &quot;the flood&quot; or &quot;torrent&quot; in Kréyòl. The coup d&#x27;état overthrowing Aristide occurred six weeks after the 200-year anniversary of Bois Caïman, a Vodou ceremony during which Haitians planned the Haitian Revolution of 1791, which the Aristide government had commemorated at the National Palace.

A coup attempt against Aristide had taken place on 6 January, even before his inauguration, when Roger Lafontant, a Tonton Macoute leader under Duvalier, seized the provisional president Ertha Pascal-Trouillot the first and only woman president. After large numbers of Aristide supporters filled the streets in protest and Lafontant attempted to declare martial law, the army crushed the incipient coup.

During Aristide&#x27;s short-lived first period in office, he attempted to carry out substantial reforms, which brought passionate opposition from Haiti&#x27;s business and military elite. He sought to bring the military under civilian control, retiring the commander in chief of the army Hérard Abraham, initiated investigations of human rights violations, and brought to trial several Tontons Macoute who had not fled the country. He also banned the emigration of many well known Haitians until their bank accounts had been examined. His relationship with the National Assembly soon deteriorated, and he attempted repeatedly to bypass it on judicial, Cabinet and ambassadorial appointments. His nomination of his close friend and political ally, René Préval, as prime minister, provoked severe criticism from political opponents overlooked, and the National Assembly threatened a no-confidence vote against Préval in August 1991. This led to a crowd of at least 2000 at the National Palace, which threatened violence; together with Aristide&#x27;s failure to explicitly reject mob violence, this permitted the junta, which would topple him, to accuse him of human rights violations. The nomination of Marie-Denise Fabien Jean-Louis, a Duvalier-linked physician with no diplomatic experience, as minister of foreign affairs, also received significant opposition from many within the Lavalas movement.

=== 1991 coup d&#x27;état ===

In September 1991 the army performed a coup against him (1991 Haitian coup d&#x27;état), led by army general Raoul Cédras, who had been promoted by Aristide in June to commander in chief of the army. Aristide was deposed on 29 September 1991, and after several days sent into exile, his life only saved by the intervention of U.S., French and Venezuelan diplomats. In accordance with the requirements of article 149 of the Haitian Constitution, Superior Court justice Joseph Nérette was installed as président provisoire to serve until elections were held within 90 days of Aristide&#x27;s resignation. However, real power was held by army commander Raoul Cédras. High-ranking members of the Haitian National Intelligence Service (SIN), which had been set up and financed in the 1980s by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as part of the war on drugs, were involved in the coup, and were reportedly still receiving funding and training from the CIA for intelligence-gathering activities at the time of the coup, but this funding reportedly ended after the coup. The &quot;New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;No evidence suggests that the C.I.A. backed the coup or intentionally undermined President Aristide.&quot; However, press reports about possible CIA involvement in Haitian politics before the coup sparked congressional hearings in the United States.

A campaign of terror against Aristide supporters was started by Emmanuel Constant after Aristide was forced out of power. In 1993, Constant, who had been on the CIA&#x27;s payroll as an informant since 1992, organized the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haïti (FRAPH), which targeted and killed Aristide supporters.

Aristide spent his exile first in Venezuela and then in the United States, working to develop international support. A United Nations trade embargo during Aristide&#x27;s exile, intended to force the coup leaders to step down, was a strong blow to Haiti&#x27;s already weak economy. President George H. W. Bush granted an exemption from the embargo to many U.S. companies doing business in Haiti, and president Bill Clinton extended this exemption.

In addition to this trade with the United States, the coup regime was supported by massive profits from the drug trade thanks to the Haitian military&#x27;s affiliation with the Cali Cartel; Aristide publicly stated that his own pursuit of arresting drug dealers was one event that prompted the coup by drug-affiliated military officials Raul Cedras and Michel Francois (a claim echoed by his former secretary of State Patrick Elie). Representative John Conyers (D-Michigan) expressed concern that the only U.S. government agency to publicly recognize the Haitian junta&#x27;s role in drug trafficking was the Drug Enforcement Administration, and that, despite a wealth of evidence provided by the DEA proving the junta&#x27;s drug connections, the Clinton administration downplayed this factor rather than use it as a hedge against the junta (as the U.S. government had done against Manuel Noriega). Nairn in particular alleged that the CIA&#x27;s connections to these drug traffickers in the junta not only dated to the creation of SIN, but were ongoing during and after the coup. Nairn&#x27;s claims are confirmed in part by revelations of Emmanuel Constant regarding the ties of his FRAPH organization to the CIA before and during the coup government.

=== 1994 return ===
Following large pro-Aristide demonstrations by Haitian expats (estimated over 60,000 demonstrators in New York City) urging Bill Clinton to deliver on his election promise to return Aristide to Haiti, U.S. and international pressure (including United Nations Security Council Resolution 940 on 31 July 1994), persuaded the military regime to back down and U.S. troops were deployed in the country by President Bill Clinton. On 15 October 1994, the Clinton administration returned Aristide to Haiti to complete his term in office.

Aristide received the 1996 UNESCO Prize for human rights education.

== Opposition (1996–2001) ==

In late 1996, Aristide broke from the OPL over what he called its &quot;distance from the people&quot; and created a new political party, the Fanmi Lavalas. The OPL, holding the majority in the Sénat and the Chambre des Députés, renamed itself the Organisation du Peuple en Lutte, maintaining the OPL acronym.

Fanmi Lavalas won the 2000 legislative election in May, but a handful of Senate seats were allocated to Lavalas candidates that critics claimed should have had second-round runoffs (as the votes of some smaller parties were eliminated in final vote counts, which had also been done in earlier elections). Critics argue that FL had not achieved a first-round majority for this handful of senate seats. Critics also charge that Fanmi Lavalas controlled the Provisional Election Commission which made the decision, but their criticism is of a vote count technique used prior in Haiti history. Aristide then was elected later that year in the 2000 presidential election, an election boycotted by most opposition political parties, now organised into the Convergence Démocratique. Although the U.S. government claimed that the election turnout was hardly over 10%, international observers saw turnout of around 50%, and at the time, CNN reported a turnout of 60% with over 92% voting for Aristide. The Bush administration in the U.S. and Haitian expatriate opposition leaders in Florida would use the criticism over the election to argue for an embargo on international aid to the Haitian government.

== Second presidency (2001–2004) ==

In 2003, Aristide called for France, the former colonizer of the country, to pay $21 billion in restitution to Haiti for the 90 million gold francs supplied to France by Haiti in restitution for French property, including enslaved people, that was appropriated in the Haitian rebellion, over the period from 1825 to 1947.

=== 2004 overthrow ===
It has been alleged that after his return to power in 2001, Aristide increasingly relied on street gangs to enforce his will and to terrorize his political opponents. After the murder of Amiot Métayer, the leader of the pro-Aristide Lame Kanibal (Cannibal Army) gang in the Raboteau slum in the northern city of Gonaïves in September 2003, Métayer&#x27;s partisans, believing that Aristide had ordered his killing, rose up against the president. On 5 December 2003, organized pro-Aristide forces committed and encouraged violent attacks and threats against University of Port-au-Prince students protesting against Aristide.

In early 2004, the Cannibal Army was joined in its fight against the government by former military and police, many of whom had been in exile in the Dominican Republic and who had been launching cross-border raids since 2001. The paramilitary campaign was headed by ex-police chief Guy Philippe and former FRAPH death squad founder Louis Jodel Chamblain. In February 2004, pro-Aristide forces were accused of committing a massacre in the city of Saint-Marc.

The rebels soon took control of the North, and eventually laid siege to, and then invaded, the capital. Under disputed circumstances, Aristide was flown out of the country by the U.S. with assistance from Canada and France on 28 February 2004. Aristide and his bodyguard, Franz Gabriel, stated that he was the victim of a &quot;new coup d&#x27;état or modern kidnapping&quot; by U.S. forces. Mrs. Aristide stated that the personnel who escorted him wore U.S. Special Forces uniforms, but changed into civilian clothes upon boarding the aircraft that was used to remove them from Haiti. Jamaican prime minister P. J. Patterson released a statement saying &quot;we are bound to question whether his resignation was truly voluntary, as it comes after the capture of regions of Haiti by armed insurgents and the failure of the international community to provide the requisite support. The removal of President Aristide in these circumstances sets a dangerous precedent for democratically elected governments anywhere and everywhere, as it promotes the removal of duly elected persons from office by the power of rebel forces.&quot; Meanwhile, National Palace security agent Casimir Chariot said that Aristide left of his own free will. Aristide&#x27;s Prime Minister, Yvon Neptune, also said that Aristide&#x27;s resignation was genuine.

After Aristide was flown out of Haiti, looters raided his villa. Most barricades were lifted the day after Aristide left as the shooting had stopped; order was maintained by Haitian police, along with armed rebels and local vigilantes. Almost immediately after the Aristide family was transported from Haiti, the prime minister of Jamaica, P. J. Patterson, dispatched a member of parliament, Sharon Hay-Webster, to the Central African Republic. The leadership of that country agreed that Aristide and his family could go to Jamaica. The Aristide family remained on the island for several months until the Jamaican government gained acceptance by the Republic of South Africa for the family to relocate there.

Aristide later claimed that France and the U.S. had a role in what he termed &quot;a kidnapping&quot; that took him from Haiti to South Africa via the Central African Republic. However, authorities said his temporary asylum there had been negotiated by the United States, France and Gabon. On 1 March 2004, U.S. congresswoman Maxine Waters, along with Aristide family friend Randall Robinson, reported Aristide had told them that he had been forced to resign and had been abducted from the country by the United States and that he had been held hostage by an armed military guard. According to Waters, Mildred Aristide called her at her home at 6:30 am, informing her that &quot;the coup d&#x27;etat has been completed&quot;. She also stated how Jean-Bertrand Aristide claimed the U.S. embassy in Haiti&#x27;s chief of staff came to his house and threatened that he, alongside many other Haitians would be killed if he did not resign. Aristide&#x27;s letter, which is described as his resignation, does not actually contain Aristide clearly and officially resigning. Representative Charles Rangel, D-New York, expressed similar words, saying Aristide had told him he was &quot;disappointed that the international community had let him down&quot; and &quot;that he resigned under pressure&quot; – &quot;As a matter of fact, he was very apprehensive for his life. They made it clear that he had to go now or he would be killed.&quot; When asked for his response to these statements Colin Powell said that &quot;it might have been better for members of Congress who have heard these stories to ask us about the stories before going public with them so we don&#x27;t make a difficult situation that much more difficult&quot; and he alleged that Aristide &quot;did not democratically govern or govern well&quot;. CARICOM, an organization of Caribbean countries that included Haiti, called for a United Nations investigation into Aristide&#x27;s removal, but were reportedly pressured by the U.S. and France to drop their request. Some observers suggest the rebellion and removal of Aristide were covertly orchestrated by these two countries and Canada.

In 2022, Thierry Burkard, the French ambassador to Haiti at the time, told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that France and the United States had effectively orchestrated a coup against Aristide by forcing him into exile. In response to this, James Brendan Foley, U.S. Ambassador to Haiti at the time of the coup, called these claims untrue, stating that it was never U.S. policy to remove Aristide. He said that Aristide had requested a U.S. rescue and that the decision to dispatch a plane to carry him to safety had been agreed upon following night-time discussions at the behest of Aristide.

In a 2006 interview, Aristide claimed the United States reneged on compromises he made with it over the privatization of enterprises to ensure that part of the profits from those enterprises would be distributed to the Haitian population and then relied on a disinformation campaign to discredit him.

== Exile (2004–2011) ==

After being cast into exile, in mid-2004 Aristide, his family, and bodyguards were welcomed to South Africa by several cabinet ministers, 20 senior diplomats, and a guard of honor. Receiving a salary from and provided staff by the South African government, Aristide lived with his family in a government villa in Pretoria. In South Africa, Aristide became an honorary research fellow at the University of South Africa, learned Zulu, and, on 25 April 2007, received a doctorate in African languages.

On 21 December 2007, a speech by Aristide marking the new year and Haiti&#x27;s Independence Day was broadcast, the fourth such speech since his exile; in the speech he criticized the 2006 presidential election in which Préval was elected, describing it as a &quot;selection&quot;, in which &quot;the knife of treason was planted&quot; in the back of the Haitian people.

Since the election, some high-ranking members of Lavalas have been targets for violence. Lovinsky Pierre-Antoine, a leading human rights organizer in Haiti and a member of Lavalas, disappeared in August 2007. His whereabouts remain unknown and a news article states: &quot;Like many protesters, he [Wilson Mesilien, coordinator of the pro-Aristide 30 September Foundation] wore a T-shirt demanding the return of foundation leader Lovinsky Pierre-Antoine, a human rights activist and critic of both U.N. and U.S. involvement in Haiti who disappeared in August.&quot;

=== Return to Haiti ===
In a confidential 2008 United States embassy cable, former U.S. ambassador to Haiti Janet Sanderson emphasized that: &quot;A premature departure of MINUSTAH would leave the [Haitian] government...vulnerable to...resurgent populist and anti-market economy political forcesreversing gains of the last two years. MINUSTAH is an indispensable tool in realizing core USG [U.S. government] policy interests in Haiti.&quot;

At a meeting with U.S. State Department officials on 2 August 2006, former Guatemalan diplomat Edmond Mulet, then chief of MINUSTAH, urged U.S. legal action against Aristide to prevent the former president from gaining more traction with the Haitian population and returning to Haiti.

At Mulet&#x27;s request, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan urged South Africa’s president Thabo Mbeki to ensure that Aristide remained in the country.

U.S. ambassador James Foley wrote in a confidential 22 March 2005 cable that an August 2004 poll &quot;showed that Aristide was still the only figure in Haiti with a favorability rating above 50%&quot;.

After René Préval, a former ally of Aristide, was elected president of Haiti in 2006, he said it would be possible for Aristide to return to Haiti.

On 16 December 2009, several thousand protesters marched through Port-au-Prince calling for Aristide&#x27;s return to Haiti, and protesting the exclusion of Aristide&#x27;s Fanmi Lavalas party from upcoming elections.

On 12 January 2010, Aristide sent his condolences to victims of the earthquake in Haiti just a few hours after it occurred, and stated that he wished to return to help rebuild the country.

On 7 November 2010, in an exclusive interview (the last given before his return to Haiti) with independent reporter Nicolas Rossier in &quot;Eurasia Review&quot; and the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, Aristide declared that the 2010 elections were not inclusive of his party, Fanmi Lavalas, and therefore not fair and free. He also confirmed his wishes to go back to Haiti but stated that he was not allowed to travel out of South Africa.

In February 2011, Aristide announced that he would return to Haiti within days of the ruling Haitian government removing impediments to him receiving his Haitian passport. On 17 March 2011, Aristide departed for Haiti from his exile in South Africa. U.S. president Barack Obama had asked South African president Jacob Zuma to delay Aristide&#x27;s departure to prevent him from returning to Haiti before a presidential run-off election scheduled for 20 March. Aristide&#x27;s party was barred from participating in the election, and the U.S. feared his return could be destabilizing. On Friday, 18 March 2011, he and his spouse arrived at Port-au-Prince Airport, and were greeted by thousands of supporters. He told the crowd waiting at the airport: &quot;The exclusion of Fanmi Lavalas is the exclusion of the Haitian people. In 1804, the Haitian revolution marked the end of slavery. Today, may the Haitian people end exiles and coups d’état, while peacefully moving from social exclusion to inclusion.&quot;

==Post-exile (2011–present)==
After Aristide returned to Haiti in 2011, he abstained from political involvement. On 12 September 2014, Aristide was ordered under house arrest by Judge Lamarre Belzaire while under a corruption investigation. Aristide&#x27;s lawyers and supporters of Fanmi Lavalas questioned the legality of the judge&#x27;s order under Haitian law as well as the judge&#x27;s impartiality.

During the elections of 1991 and 2000 of Aristide and the 1995 and 2006 elections of Rene Preval, the turnout of the total voting population hovered at around 60–70%. In the years following the 2010 earthquake, turnout in elections dropped significantly to 20%. During this period, the right-wing rose to power, with mass voter disenfranchisement. In late 2016 Aristide, for the first time in many years, returned to electioneering, touring the country to promote Fanmi Lavalas candidates; the election results (decried by his party as illegitimate) returned to power right-wing forces in the country, with only a 20% voter turnout.

== Accomplishments ==

Under president Aristide&#x27;s leadership, the Haitian government implemented many major reforms. These included greatly increasing access to health care and education for the general population, increasing adult literacy and protections for those accused of crimes, improving training for judges, prohibiting human trafficking, disbanding the Haitian military, establishing an improved climate for human rights and civil liberties, doubling the minimum wage, instituting land reform and assistance to small farmers, providing boat construction training to fishermen, establishing a food distribution network to provide low cost food to the poor at below market prices, building low-cost housing, and reducing government corruption.

=== Achievements in education ===
During successive Lavalas administrations, Jean-Bertrand Aristide and René Préval built 195 new primary schools and 104 secondary schools. Prior to Aristide&#x27;s election in 1990, there were just 34 secondary schools nationwide. Lavalas also provided thousands of scholarships so that children could afford to attend church/private schools. Between 2001 and 2004, the percentage of children enrolled in primary school education rose to 72%, and an estimated 300,000 adults took part in Lavalas sponsored adult literacy campaigns. This helped the adult literacy rate rise from 35% to 55%.

=== Achievements in health care ===

In addition to numerous educational advances, Aristide and Lavalas embarked on an ambitious plan to develop the public primary health care system with Cuban assistance. Since the devastation unleashed by Hurricane Georges in 1998, Cuba entered a humanitarian agreement with Haiti whereby Haitian doctors would be trained in Cuba, and Cuban doctors would work in rural areas. At the time of 2010 Haiti earthquake, 573 doctors had been trained in Cuba.

Despite operating under an aid embargo, the Lavalas administration succeeded in reducing the infant mortality rate as well as reducing the percentage of underweight newborns. A successful AIDS prevention and treatment program was also established, leading the Catholic Institute for International Relations to state: the &quot;incredible feat of slowing the rate of new infections in Haiti has been achieved despite the lack of international aid to the Haitian government, and despite the notable lack of resources faced by those working in the health field&quot;.

=== Disbanding the army and paramilitary units – the Fad&#x27;H, Tonton Macoutes, and Attaches ===
The Lavalas political project has long been dedicated to promoting a civilian police force and disbanding the long-time tools of elite repression in Haiti which have been the country&#x27;s brutal military and paramilitary forces. The government under Aristide launched the first trial of paramilitary death squads and successfully jailed many after aired on Haitian public television trials of FAdH and FRAPH members involved in massacres of civilians.

Trials were held bringing to justice a handful of wealthy individuals from among Haiti&#x27;s upper class that had financed paramilitary death squads, including individuals such as Judy C. Roy (who has acknowledged her financing of the FLRN death squads) of whom held close ties with the former dictators Raoul Cedras and Jean-Claude Duvalier. Reforming the country&#x27;s security services though posed a constant problem for Lavalas, as the U.S. sought to undermine these reform efforts by seeking to re-insert its right-wing allies into the police force. The Lavalas government also faced a lack of resources, due to cuts in aid to Haiti with US policies under the first presidency of George W. Bush. Meanwhile, there was continued prevalence of corruption in connection with the drug trade.

== Criticism ==

=== Accusations of human rights abuses ===

Human Rights Watch accused the Haitian police force under Aristide and his political supporters of attacks on opposition rallies. They also said that the emergence of armed rebels seeking to overthrow Aristide reflected &quot;the failure of the country&#x27;s democratic institutions and procedures&quot;. According to a study by researcher Jeb Sprague, the armed rebel paramilitary units received vital support from a handful of Haitian elites, Dominican governmental sectors, and foreign intelligence. The undermanned Haitian police faced difficulties in repelling cross-border attacks led by the ex-army paramilitary rebels.

Videos surfaced showing a portion of a speech by Aristide on 27 August 1991, occurring just after military personnel and death squad members attempted to assassinate him, in which he says &quot;Don&#x27;t hesitate to give him what he deserves. What a beautiful tool! What a beautiful instrument! What a beautiful piece of equipment! It&#x27;s beautiful, yes it&#x27;s beautiful, it&#x27;s cute, it&#x27;s pretty, it has a good smell, wherever you go you want to inhale it.&quot; Critics allege that he was endorsing the practice of &quot;necklacing&quot; opposition activists, placing a gasoline-soaked tire around a person&#x27;s neck and setting the tire ablaze; others argue he was actually speaking about people using the constitution to empower themselves and to defend their country against right-wing death squads. Earlier in the speech he is quoted as saying &quot;Your tool in hand, your instrument in hand, your constitution in hand! Don&#x27;t hesitate to give him what he deserves. Your equipment in hand, your trowel in hand, your pencil in hand, your Constitution in hand, don&#x27;t hesitate to give him what he deserves.&quot;

Although there were accusations of human rights abuses, the OAS/UN International Civilian Mission in Haiti, known by the French acronym MICIVIH, found that the human rights situation in Haiti improved dramatically following Aristide&#x27;s return to power in 1994. Amnesty International reported that, after Aristide&#x27;s departure in 2004, Haiti was &quot;descending into a severe humanitarian and human rights crisis&quot;. BBC correspondents say that Aristide is seen as a champion of the poor, and remains popular with many in Haiti. Aristide continues to be among the most important political figures in the country, and is considered by many to be the only really popular, democratically elected leader Haiti has ever had. Yet his second administration was targeted for destabilization and is remembered as a time of great difficulty of many.

=== Accusations of corruption ===
Some officials have been indicted by a U.S. court.
Companies that allegedly made deals with Aristide&#x27;s government included IDT, Fusion Telecommunications, and Skytel; critics claim the first two companies had political links to Aristide. AT&amp;T reportedly declined to wire money to &quot;Mont Salem&quot;. Aristide&#x27;s supporters say corruption charges against the former president are a deliberate attempt to keep a popular leader from running in elections.

== Views ==
In 2000, Aristide published &quot;The Eyes of the Heart: Seeking a Path for the Poor in the Age of Globalization,&quot; which accused the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund of working on behalf of the world&#x27;s wealthiest nations rather than in the interest of genuine international development. Aristide called for &quot;a culture of global solidarity&quot; to eliminate poverty as an alternative to the globalization represented by neocolonialism and neoliberalism.

Aristide is known for organizing popular resistance to the Duvalier dynasty as a priest, and saw it a Christian duty to oppose the privilege of the rich oligarchy and social injustice of capitalism. He commented on his actions: &quot;I acted as a theologian in order to guide a political struggle: the irruption of the poor on the social scene.&quot; While sometimes described as communist, Aristide himself argues that his view are of Catholic rather than Marxist inspiration, but also clarified that Marxist writings are valuable and were used by him among other political philosophies. Aristide followed the principle of class struggle, which he saw as undeniable reality: &quot;I did not invent class struggle. Neither did Karl Marx. I would have preferred never to meet it. This may be possible if one never leaves the Vatican or the heights of Petionville [a chic Haitian suburb]. In the streets of Port-au-Prince, who has not met class struggle? It is not a topic for controversy, but a fact, based on empirical evidence.&quot;

<doc id="66796" wikidata="Q283561" url="?curid=66796" title="Alfonso V of León">
<text>Alfonso V (c. 9947 August 1028), called the Noble, was King of León from 999 to 1028. Like other kings of León, he used the title emperor () to assert his standing among the Christian rulers of Spain. He succeeded his father, Bermudo II, in 999. His mother Elvira García and count Menendo González, who raised him in Galicia, acted as his co-regents. Upon the count&#x27;s death in 1008, Alfonso ruled on his own.

==Reign==
Alfonso began the work of reorganizing the Christian kingdom of the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula after a most disastrous period of civil war and Arab inroads. Enough is known of him to justify the belief that he had some of the qualities of a soldier and a statesman.

His name and that of his wife are associated with the grant of the first franchises of León (1017). On Wednesday, 7 August 1028, Alfonso V was killed by an arrow while besieging the Muslim-occupied town of Viseu. King Alfonso was buried next to his first wife Elvira, according to his wishes, at the Church of Saint John the Baptist and San Pelayo which later changed its name to the Basilica of San Isidoro when the latter saint&#x27;s remains were transferred from Seville. The following epitaph was carved on his tomb:


==Family==
Alfonso first married Elvira Menéndez in 1013, daughter of his tutor Menendo González at whose house he was raised as a child. They had two children:
*Sancha of León, married Ferdinand I of León and Castile
*Bermudo III of León (–1037)

After Elvira&#x27;s death on 2 December 1022, Alfonso married Urraca Garcés, sister of King Sancho III of Pamplona. Before this marriage took place, the king of Pamplona had sent Ponce, abbot at the Monastery of San Pedro de Tavèrnoles, later bishop of Oviedo, and a nobleman named Garcia, to intercede before Abbot Oliba, bishop of Vic, in favor of the marriage of his sister Urraca to the king of León, despite the impediments of consanguinity. Although Bishop Oliba did not authorize the marriage, describing it as &quot;incesti connubii&quot; in a letter dated 11 May 1023, the royal wedding was celebrated between the date of the bishop&#x27;s letter and 13 November 1023 when Alfonso V and his new wife, who confirms as &quot;Urraka regina&quot;, appear together for the first time in a charter in the Cathedral of León.

Urraca and her mother Jimena Fernández made a donation on 26 September 1028 to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela confirming as &quot;Scemena regina simulque et filia mea Urraca Regina (...) genitoris nostri Fredenandus Ueremudiz et domna Geloria&quot;, and a few years later, King Bermudo III on 6 August 1031 referred to his step-mother as &quot;Urraca regina Garseani regis filia&quot;.

Alfonso and Urraca had one daughter, who was named Jimena as attested in a charter dated 22 December 1036 in a donation made by Muniadona and her son Fernando Gundemáriz, son of Gundemaro Pinióliz, whom she confirms as Jimena, daughter of King Alfonso.

<doc id="66797" wikidata="Q463418" url="?curid=66797" title="Fibroblast">
<text>A fibroblast is a type of biological cell typically with a spindle shape that synthesizes the extracellular matrix and collagen, produces the structural framework (stroma) for animal tissues, and plays a critical role in wound healing. Fibroblasts are the most common cells of connective tissue in animals.

== Structure ==

Fibroblasts have a branched cytoplasm surrounding an elliptical, speckled nucleus having two or more nucleoli. Active fibroblasts can be recognized by their abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Inactive fibroblasts, called &#x27;fibrocytes&#x27;, are smaller, spindle-shaped, and have less RER. Although disjointed and scattered when covering large spaces, fibroblasts often locally align in parallel clusters when crowded together.

Unlike the epithelial cells lining the body structures, fibroblasts do not form flat monolayers and are not restricted by a polarizing attachment to a basal lamina on one side, although they may contribute to basal lamina components in some situations (e.g. subepithelial myofibroblasts in intestine may secrete the α-2 chain-carrying component of the laminin, which is absent only in regions of follicle-associated epithelia which lack the myofibroblast lining). Fibroblasts can also migrate slowly over substratum as individual cells, again in contrast to epithelial cells. While epithelial cells form the lining of body structures, fibroblasts and related connective tissues sculpt the &quot;bulk&quot; of an organism.

The life span of a fibroblast, as measured in chick embryos, is 57 ± 3 days.

===Relationship with fibrocytes===
Fibroblasts and fibrocytes are two states of the same cells, the former being the activated state, the latter the less active state, concerned with maintenance and tissue metabolism. Currently, there is a tendency to call both forms fibroblasts. The suffix &quot;-blast&quot; is used in cellular biology to denote a stem cell or a cell in an activated state of metabolism.

Fibroblasts are morphologically heterogeneous with diverse appearances depending on their location and activity. Though morphologically inconspicuous, ectopically transplanted fibroblasts can often retain positional memory of the location and tissue context where they had previously resided, at least over a few generations. This remarkable behavior may lead to discomfort in the rare event that they stagnate there excessively.

===Development===

The main function of fibroblasts is to maintain the structural integrity of connective tissues by continuously secreting precursors of the extracellular matrix (ECM), providing all such components, primarily the ground substance and a variety of fibers. The composition of the ECM determines the physical properties of connective tissues.

Like other cells of connective tissue, fibroblasts are derived from primitive mesenchyme. Hence, they express the intermediate filament protein vimentin, a feature used as a marker to distinguish their mesodermal origin. However, this test is not specific as epithelial cells cultured in vitro on adherent substratum may also express vimentin after some time.

In certain situations, epithelial cells can give rise to fibroblasts, a process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Conversely, fibroblasts in some situations may give rise to epithelia by undergoing a mesenchymal to epithelial transition and organizing into a condensed, polarized, laterally connected true epithelial sheet. This process is seen in many developmental situations (e.g. nephron and notocord development), as well as in wound healing and tumorigenesis.

== Function ==
Fibroblasts make collagen fibers, glycosaminoglycans, reticular and elastic fibers. The fibroblasts of growing individuals divide and synthesize ground substance. Tissue damage stimulates fibrocytes and induces the production of fibroblasts.

===Inflammation===
Besides their commonly known role as structural components, fibroblasts play a critical role in an immune response to a tissue injury. They are early players in initiating inflammation in the presence of invading microorganisms. They induce chemokine synthesis through the presentation of receptors on their surface. Immune cells then respond and initiate a cascade of events to clear the invasive microorganisms. Receptors on the surface of fibroblasts also allow regulation of hematopoietic cells and provide a pathway for immune cells to regulate fibroblasts.

===Tumour mediation===
Fibroblasts, like tumor-associated host fibroblasts (TAF), play a crucial role in immune regulation through TAF-derived ECM components and modulators. TAF are known to be significant in the inflammatory response as well as immune suppression in tumors. TAF-derived ECM components cause alterations in ECM composition and initiate the ECM remodeling. ECM remodeling is described as changes in the ECM as a result of enzyme activity which can lead to degradation of the ECM. Immune regulation of tumors is largely determined by ECM remodeling because the ECM is responsible for regulating a variety of functions, such as proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis of vital organs. In many tumor types, especially those related to the epithelial cells, ECM remodeling is common. Examples of TAF-derived ECM components include Tenascin and Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), which can be found in sites of chronic inflammation and carcinomas, respectively.

Immune regulation of tumors can also occur through the TAF-derived modulators. Although these modulators may sound similar to the TAF-derived ECM components, they differ in the sense that they are responsible for the variation and turnover of the ECM. Cleaved ECM molecules can play a critical role in immune regulation. Proteases like matrix metalloproteineases and the uPA system are known to cleave the ECM. These proteases are derived from fibroblasts.

===Use of fibroblasts as feeder cells===
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are often used as supportive &quot;feeder cells&quot; in research using human embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and primary epithelial cell culture. However, many researchers are trying to phase out MEFs in favor of culture media with precisely defined ingredients in order to facilitate the development of clinical-grade products.

In view of the potential clinical applications of stem cell-derived tissues or primary epithelial cells, the use of human fibroblasts as an alternative to MEF feeders has been studied. Whereas the fibroblasts are usually used to maintain pluripotency of the stem cells, they can also be used to facilitate development of the stem cells into specific type of cells such as cardiomyocytes.

=== Host immune response ===
Fibroblasts from different anatomical sites in the body express many genes that code for immune mediators and proteins. These mediators of immune response enable the cellular communication with hematopoietic immune cells. The immune activity of non-hematopoietic cells, such as fibroblasts, is referred to as “structural immunity”. In order to facilitate a fast response to immunological challenges, fibroblasts encode crucial aspects of the structural cell immune response in the epigenome.

<doc id="66798" wikidata="Q296309" url="?curid=66798" title="Maurice Greene (sprinter)">
<text>Maurice Greene (born July 23, 1974) is an American former track and field sprinter who competed in the 60 meters, 100 meters, and 200 meters. He is a former 100 m world record holder with a time of 9.79 seconds. During the height of his career (1997–2004) he won four Olympic medals and was a five-time World Champion. This included three golds at the 1999 World Championships, a feat which had previously only been achieved by Carl Lewis and Michael Johnson and has since been equaled by three others.

His career was affected by several injuries from 2001 onwards, although he won the 100 meters bronze and silver in the sprint relay at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Greene was also successful indoors: he was the 1999 Indoor World Champion, was the world record holder in the 60-meter dash for nearly 20 years and remains the joint-fastest man over 50 meters. He raced sparingly after an injury in 2005 and officially retired in 2008. Over his career, he made the third most sub-10-second runs (52) in the 100m, tied with Usain Bolt and only surpassed by Asafa Powell and Justin Gatlin.

Following his track career he has become an ambassador for the IAAF and a television personality, appearing on &quot;Identity&quot;, &quot;Blind Date&quot;, and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Most recently he volunteered as a track coach at University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) for the 2012–2013 season.

Since then he has become a physical education teacher at American Leadership Academy in Arizona. 

==Early life==
Greene was born in Kansas City, Kansas and attended F.L. Schlagle High School. In his youth and high school, he participated in both American football and track and field. After high school, Greene received a Track scholarship to the University of Kansas. Greene also attended Park University and Kansas City Kansas Community College.

==Sports career==
===Early career and breakthrough===
In 1995 he took part in his first major international tournament at the World Championships in Gothenburg, but was eliminated in the 100 m quarter-finals. His next season was disappointing, as he failed to make the American team for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. After watching the Olympic final from the stands, Greene made his way to Los Angeles to seek the coaching of John Smith. He joined the start-up HSI group. He went on to become the group&#x27;s most visible member.

The following season would be his breakthrough. At the World Championships in Athens, Greene won the 100 m title. This marked the beginning of Greene&#x27;s dominance in the 100 m. He successfully defended his title in 1999 and 2001 and captured the Olympic gold medal in the 2000 Olympics. He was also successful at the 200 m. At the 1999 World Championships, he also won the 200 m title, the first to win both sprint events at a World Championships. However, he did not run the 200 m at the 2000 Olympics after an injury at the US trials.

===World record holder and athletic prime===
In 1999 he set the 100 m world record at 9.79 s (+0.1 m/s wind), beating Donovan Bailey&#x27;s standing world record of 9.84 s (+0.7 m/s wind), and lowering the world record by the largest margin since the advent of electronic timing. Greene also matched Bailey&#x27;s 50 m indoor world record time, but the run was never ratified. He also set the 60 m indoor world record twice. His 60 m indoor record is currently at 6.39 seconds. In addition, Maurice Greene was the only sprinter to hold the 60 m and 100 m world records at the same time. The previous IAAF logo was created in Greene&#x27;s image.

In 2002, Greene lost his 100 m world record to fellow American Tim Montgomery, who beat his time by 0.01 (9.78 s +2.0 m/s), while Greene himself was injured and watched the race from the stands; Montgomery has since been found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs, and his record has been retroactively rescinded. The record was broken legitimately by Asafa Powell in 2005 with a time of 9.77 s (+1.6 m/s wind).

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greene added to his medal tally with the bronze after finishing third in his attempt to defend his 100 m title to Justin Gatlin, and a silver as the anchor leg runner on the United States 4 × 100 m relay team, narrowly denied another Olympic Gold by the British team, who won by 0.01 seconds.

Greene ran 52 sub-10-second 100 m races during his career, which at the time was more than any other sprinter in history. This record has now been surpassed by Asafa Powell who has 97 100 m sub-10-second runs to his name and Justin Gatlin who has 64 100 m sub-10-second runs to his name and equalled by Usain Bolt who has the same amount of sub-10-second runs with 52. Previously Greene had held the record for the most wind-legal sub-10-second clockings for 100 m in one season when he ran 9 sub-10s in 1999. This record was also broken by Asafa Powell in 2006 (12), and it was improved by Powell in 2008 to 15.

On December 21, 2006, he appeared as one of the &quot;strangers&quot; on the NBC game show &quot;Identity&quot;. The contestant, a self-professed track and field fan, incorrectly identified him by name as Marion Jones, although she identified him as the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest man.&quot;

===Post-running===
On February 4, 2008, Greene announced his retirement from track and field in Beijing, citing nagging injuries and a wish to see new individuals succeed in the sport. Greene said he hopes to pursue coaching and business interests.

In April 2008, the New York Times reported that Greene had paid Mexican discus thrower Angel Guillermo Heredia $10,000, which Heredia claimed was in payment for performance-enhancing drugs. Greene admitted meeting Heredia and making the payment but claimed it was common for him to pay for &quot;stuff&quot; for other members of his training group, and reiterated that he had never used banned drugs.

Greene was a contestant on Season 7 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, and was paired with two-time champion Cheryl Burke. He was eliminated in Week 8 of the competition, taking 5th place. He hyperextended his leg during the competition. He later helped out in their pro-dancer competition and danced a Tango with future winner Anna Demidova. Greene also appeared on the American television series &quot;Blind Date&quot; where he was paired with a woman named Christie. Greene and Christie agreed that they would see each other again.

He has a tattoo that reads GOAT referring to his claim to be the &quot;Greatest of All Time&quot;.

==Media==
In an event set up by ESPN&#x27;s Todd Gallagher, Greene appeared in the book &quot;Andy Roddick Beat Me With a Frying Pan&quot; racing in a 100-meter race against the book&#x27;s editor, who had a 31-meter head start and the help of a moving sidewalk. Greene lost by a nose.

Maurice Greene hosted the monthly show &quot;Greene Light&quot; on Eurosport where he met stars of athletics, such as Blanka Vlašić, Allyson Felix and Churandy Martina.

Greene was also the cover athlete for the multi-platform video game International Track &amp; Field 2000, which was developed by Konami.

<doc id="66809" wikidata="Q956283" url="?curid=66809" title="Kokichi Mikimoto">
<text>was a Japanese entrepreneur who is credited with creating the first cultured pearl and subsequently starting the cultured pearl industry with the establishment of his luxury pearl company Mikimoto.

He was inducted into the House of Peers by imperial decree and posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure. On 18 April 1985, the Japan Patent Office selected him as one of Ten Japanese Great Inventors.

The company was ranked as one of the world&#x27;s most luxurious brands by &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; Magazine and Mikimoto was considered one of the best Japanese financial leaders of the 20th century by Nihon Keizai Shimbun. He is also known as the founder of Mikimoto Pharmaceuticals, a company specialising in beauty products containing pearl calcium. Mikimoto Pearl Island is named after him. In addition, the &quot;Phoenix Mikimoto Crown&quot; used by Miss Universe winners as well as the pageant crown used by Miss International is credited to his patented work.

==Early life== 
Mikimoto was born 25 January 1858 in Toba, Shima Province (now Mie Prefecture). Mikimoto&#x27;s father was an &quot;udon&quot; shop owner. Mikimoto was the eldest son. At age 11, Mikimoto&#x27;s father fell ill. He left school at the age of 13 and sold vegetables to support his family. Seeing the pearl divers of Ise unloading their treasures at the shore in his childhood started his fascination with pearls. At the age of 20, Mikimoto noticed the many flaws of pearls as he judged a pearl exhibition in 1878. This began Mikimoto&#x27;s search for the development of the perfect pearl.

==Pioneering cultured pearls==
Mikimoto began his search of an alternative method to produce pearls as the chairman of the Shima Marine Products Improvement Association. At this point the demand for pearls had severely outweighed the supply, prompting the consideration of an effort to protect the oysters.
In 1888, Mikimoto obtained a loan to start his first pearl oyster farm at the Shinmei inlet on Ago Bay in Mie prefecture with his wife and partner Ume. On 11 July 1893, after many failures and near bankruptcy, he was able to create the hemispherical cultured pearls. The pearls were made by seeding the oyster with a small amount of mother of pearl. Despite this major discovery there were initially difficulties in selling his cultured pearls due to public confusion. To encourage sales, Mikimoto opened a jewelry boutique in Ginza where he was able to have workers educate the consumer on the nature of the cultured pearls. He introduced these pearls at a marine products exposition in Norway in 1897 and began an export business. However, it took him another 12 years to create completely spherical pearls that were indistinguishable from the highest quality natural ones, and commercially viable harvests were not obtained until the 1920s. In 1927, Mikimoto met with inventor Thomas Edison, who was in awe of Mikimoto&#x27;s cultured pearls as it was &quot;supposed to be biologically impossible&quot;.
Mikimoto did not know that government biologist Tokichi Nishikawa and a carpenter, Tatsuhei Mise, had each spent time in Australia and learned the secret to spherical pearl production from expatriate British marine biologist William Saville-Kent – inserting a piece of oyster epithelial membrane (the lip of mantle tissue) with a nucleus of shell or metal into an oyster&#x27;s body or mantle causes the tissue to form a pearl sack. The sack produces nacre, which coats the nucleus, thus creating a pearl. Mise received a 1907 patent for this grafting needle. When Nishikawa applied in the same year, he realized that Mise had already secured a patent. In a compromise, the pair agreed to cooperate, calling their discovery the &quot;Mise-Nishikawa method&quot;.

Mikimoto had received a patent in 1896 for producing hemispherical pearls, or mabes, and a 1908 patent for culturing in mantle tissue, but he could not use the Mise-Nishikawa method without invalidating his own patents. Mikimoto then altered his patent application to cover a technique to make round pearls in mantle tissue, which was granted in 1916. However, this method was not commercially viable. Mikimoto finally made arrangements to use Nishikawa&#x27;s methods after 1916, and Mikimoto&#x27;s business began to expand rapidly.

==Industry success== 

The new technology enabled Japan&#x27;s cultured pearl industry to quickly expand after 1916; by 1935 there were 350 pearl farms in Japan producing 10 million cultured pearls annually.

===Mikimoto Pearl Company===
In 1899, the first Mikimoto pearl shop opened in the fashionable Ginza district of Tokyo selling natural seed pearls and half round pearls. The Mikimoto business expanded internationally, opening stores in London (1913).

By 1935, the Japanese pearl industry was facing oversupply issues and plummeting prices for Japanese cultured pearls. Mikimoto promoted Japanese pearls in Europe and the US to counteract falling prices. He publicly burnt tons of low-quality pearls as a publicity stunt to establish a reputation that the Mikimoto company only sold high-quality cultured pearls.
After World War II, Mikimoto opened stores in Paris, New York City, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Shanghai, and Bombay, and was thus one of the first Japanese brands to attain an international presence and recognition.

Mikimoto had to constantly fight allegations that his pearls were only &quot;imitations&quot; of real pearls, despite scientific reports to the contrary. Mikimoto took advantage of every opportunity to personally promote his pearls, and took part in the 1926 Philadelphia World Exposition in which he displayed a replica of the &quot;Liberty Bell&quot; covered with pearls.

Mikimoto was the official jeweler of the Miss USA (2003–2008), Miss Universe (2002–2007 and 2017–2019) and Miss Teen USA (2002–2008) pageants, under the Miss Universe Organization.

In 2010–11, the company&#x27;s estimated total sales were €300 million.

In June 2013, the company was chosen to design a five-piece parure consisting of a brooch, necklace, earrings, bracelet and the state diadem for Princess Kako of Akishino&#x27;s 20th birthday anniversary, valued at ¥30 Million JPY (US$279,000). The illustrious tiara features both floral motif and national symbols of Japan.

== Personal life ==
Mikimoto&#x27;s wife was Ume, who was also his partner in creating the cultured pearl. Mikimoto and his wife have five children: Rui (eldest daughter), Mine (second daughter), Yo (third daughter), Ai (youngest daughter), and Ryuzo (son).

On 21 September 1954, Mikimoto died at the age of 96. Mikimoto&#x27;s personal memorabilia are displayed at Mikimoto Pearl Island Memorial Hall, a museum in Toba, Japan.

<doc id="66811" wikidata="Q1051223" url="?curid=66811" title="Seasonal affective disorder">
<text>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a mood disorder subset in which people who typically have normal mental health throughout most of the year exhibit depressive symptoms at the same time each year. It is commonly, but not always, associated with the reductions or increases in total daily sunlight hours that occur during the winter or summer.

Common symptoms include sleeping too much, having little to no energy, and overeating. The condition in the summer can include heightened anxiety.
In the DSM-IV and DSM-5, its status as a standalone condition was changed: It is no longer classified as a unique mood disorder but is now a specifier (called &quot;with seasonal pattern&quot;) for recurrent major depressive disorder that occurs at a specific time of the year and fully remits otherwise. Although experts were initially skeptical, this condition is now recognized as a common disorder. The validity of SAD was called into question, however, by a 2016 analysis by the Centers for Disease Control in which no links were detected between depression and seasonality or sunlight exposure.

In the United States, the percentage of the population affected by SAD ranges from 1.4% of the population in Florida to 9.9% in Alaska. SAD was formally described and named in 1984 by Norman E. Rosenthal and colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health.

==History==
SAD was first systematically reported and named in the early 1980s by Norman E. Rosenthal and his colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The initial investigation was motivated by observations of depression occurring during the dark winter months in northern regions of the United States, known as polar night. Rosenthal proposed that the reduction in available natural light during winter could contribute to this phenomenon. Subsequently, he and his colleagues conducted a placebo-controlled study that utilized light therapy to document the effects of the condition. A paper based on Rosenthal&#x27;s research was published in 1984. Although Rosenthal&#x27;s ideas were initially greeted with skepticism, SAD has become well recognized, and his 1993 book &quot;Winter Blues&quot; has become the standard introduction to the subject.

Research on SAD in the United States began in 1979 when Herb Kern, a research engineer, noticed he felt depressed during the winter months. Kern suspected that scarcer natural light in winter was the cause and discussed the idea with NIMH scientists working on bodily rhythms. They were intrigued and responded by inventing a lightbox to treat Kern&#x27;s depression, which improved.

==Signs and symptoms==
SAD is a type of major depressive disorder, and those with the condition may exhibit any of the associated symptoms, such as feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, thoughts of suicide, loss of interest in activities, withdrawal from social interaction, sleep and appetite problems, difficulty with concentrating and making decisions, decreased libido, a lack of energy, or agitation. Symptoms of winter SAD often include falling asleep earlier or in less than 5 minutes in the evening, oversleeping or difficulty waking up in the morning, nausea, and a tendency to overeat, often with a craving for carbohydrates, which leads to weight gain. SAD is typically associated with winter depression, but springtime lethargy or other seasonal mood patterns are not uncommon. Although each individual case is different, in contrast to winter SAD, people who experience spring and summer depression may be more likely to show symptoms such as insomnia, decreased appetite and weight loss, and agitation or anxiety.

===Bipolar disorder===
&quot;With seasonal pattern&quot; is a specifier for &quot;bipolar and related disorders&quot;, including bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder.
Most people with SAD experience major depressive disorder, but as many as 20% may have a bipolar disorder. It is important to distinguish between diagnoses because there are important treatment differences. In these cases, people who have the &quot;With seasonal pattern&quot; specifier may experience a depressive episode either due to major depressive disorder or as part of bipolar disorder during the winter and remit in the summer. Around 25% of patients with bipolar disorder may present with a depressive seasonal pattern, which is associated with bipolar II disorder, rapid cycling, eating disorders, and more depressive episodes. Differences in biological sex display distinct clinical characteristics associated to seasonal pattern: males present with more Bipolar II disorder and a higher number of depressive episodes, and females with rapid cycling and eating disorders.

=== ADHD ===
A study by the National Institute of Health published findings in 2016 that concluded, &quot;seasonal and circadian rhythm disturbances are significantly associated with ADHD symptoms.&quot; Participants in the study who had ADHD were three times more likely to have SAD symptoms (9.9% vs 3.3%), and about 2.7 times more likely to have s-SAD symptoms (12.5% vs 4.6%).

==Cause==
In many species, activity is diminished during the winter months, in response to the reduction in available food, the reduction of sunlight (especially for diurnal animals), and the difficulties of surviving in cold weather. Hibernation is an extreme example, but even species that do not hibernate often exhibit changes in behavior during the winter.

Various proximate causes have been proposed. One possibility is that SAD is related to a lack of serotonin, and serotonin polymorphisms could play a role in SAD, although this has been disputed. Mice incapable of turning serotonin into N-acetylserotonin (by serotonin N-acetyltransferase) appear to express &quot;depression-like&quot; behavior, and antidepressants such as fluoxetine increase the amount of the enzyme serotonin N-acetyltransferase, resulting in an antidepressant-like effect. Another theory is that the cause may be related to melatonin, which is produced in dim light and darkness by the pineal gland, since there are direct connections, via the retinohypothalamic tract and the suprachiasmatic nucleus, between the retina and the pineal gland. Melatonin secretion is controlled by the endogenous circadian clock, but can also be suppressed by bright light.

One study looked at whether some people could be predisposed to SAD based on personality traits. Correlations between certain personality traits, higher levels of neuroticism, agreeableness, openness, and an avoidance-oriented coping style, appeared to be common in those with SAD.

==Pathophysiology==
Seasonal mood variations are believed to be related to light. An argument for this view is the effectiveness of bright-light therapy. SAD is measurably present at latitudes in the Arctic region, such as northern Finland (64°00′N), where the rate of SAD is 9.5%. Cloud cover may contribute to the negative effects of SAD. There is evidence that many patients with SAD have a delay in their circadian rhythm, and that bright light treatment corrects these delays which may be responsible for the improvement in patients.

The symptoms of it mimic those of dysthymia or even major depressive disorder. There is also potential risk of suicide in some patients experiencing SAD. One study reports 6–35% of people with the condition required hospitalization during one period of illness. At times, patients may not feel depressed, but rather lack energy to perform everyday activities.

Subsyndromal Seasonal Affective Disorder (s-SAD or SSAD) is a milder form of SAD experienced by an estimated 14.3% (vs. 6.1% SAD) of the U.S. population. The blue feeling experienced by both those with SAD and with SSAD can usually be dampened or extinguished by exercise and increased outdoor activity, particularly on sunny days, resulting in increased solar exposure. Connections between human mood, as well as energy levels, and the seasons are well documented, even in healthy individuals.

==Diagnosis==
According to the American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV criteria, Seasonal Affective Disorder is not regarded as a separate disorder. It is called a &quot;course specifier&quot; and may be applied as an added description to the pattern of major depressive episodes in patients with major depressive disorder or patients with bipolar disorder.

The &quot;Seasonal Pattern Specifier&quot; must meet four criteria: depressive episodes at a particular time of the year; remissions or mania/hypomania at a characteristic time of year; these patterns must have lasted two years with no nonseasonal major depressive episodes during that same period; and these seasonal depressive episodes outnumber other depressive episodes throughout the patient&#x27;s lifetime. The Mayo Clinic describes three types of SAD, each with its own set of symptoms.

==Management==

Treatments for classic (winter-based) seasonal affective disorder include light therapy, medication, ionized-air administration, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and carefully timed supplementation of the hormone melatonin.

===Light therapy===
Photoperiod-related alterations of the duration of melatonin secretion may affect the seasonal mood cycles of SAD. This suggests that light therapy may be an effective treatment for SAD. Light therapy uses a lightbox, which emits far more lumens than a customary incandescent lamp. Bright white &quot;full spectrum&quot; light at 10,000 lux, blue light at a wavelength of 480 nm at 2,500 lux or green (actually cyan or blue-green) light at a wavelength of 500 nm at 350 lux are used, with the first-mentioned historically preferred.

Bright light therapy is effective with the patient sitting a prescribed distance, commonly 30–60 cm, in front of the box with their eyes open, but not staring at the light source, for 30–60 minutes. A study published in May 2010 suggests that the blue light often used for SAD treatment should perhaps be replaced by green or white illumination. Discovering the best schedule is essential. One study has shown that up to 69% of patients find lightbox treatment inconvenient, and as many as 19% stop use because of this.

Dawn simulation has also proven to be effective; in some studies, there is an 83% better response when compared to other bright light therapy. When compared in a study to negative air ionization, bright light was shown to be 57% effective vs. dawn simulation 50%. Patients using light therapy can experience improvement during the first week, but increased results are evident when continued throughout several weeks. Certain symptoms like hypersomnia, early insomnia, social withdrawal, and anxiety resolve more rapidly with light therapy than with cognitive behavioral therapy. Most studies have found it effective without use year round, but rather as a seasonal treatment lasting for several weeks, until frequent light exposure is naturally obtained.

Light therapy can also consist of exposure to sunlight, either by spending more time outside or using a computer-controlled heliostat to reflect sunlight into the windows of a home or office. Although light therapy is the leading treatment for seasonal affective disorder, prolonged direct sunlight or artificial lights that don&#x27;t block the ultraviolet range should be avoided, due to the threat of skin cancer.

The evidence base for light therapy as a preventive treatment for seasonal affective disorder is limited. The decision to use light therapy to treat people with a history of winter depression before depressive symptoms begin should be based on a person&#x27;s preference of treatment.

===Medication===
SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) antidepressants have proven effective in treating SAD. Effective antidepressants are fluoxetine, sertraline, or paroxetine. Both fluoxetine and light therapy are 67% effective in treating SAD, according to direct head-to-head trials conducted during the 2006 Can-SAD study. Subjects using the light therapy protocol showed earlier clinical improvement, generally within one week of beginning the clinical treatment. Bupropion extended-release has been shown to prevent SAD for one in four people, but has not been compared directly to other preventive options in trials. In a 2021 updated Cochrane review of second-generation antidepressant medications for the treatment of SAD, a definitive conclusion could not be drawn, due to lack of evidence, and the need for larger randomized controlled trials.

Modafinil may be an effective and well-tolerated treatment in patients with seasonal affective disorder/winter depression.

Another explanation is that vitamin D levels are too low when people do not get enough Ultraviolet-B on their skin. An alternative to using bright lights is to take vitamin D supplements. However, studies did not show a link between vitamin D levels and depressive symptoms in elderly Chinese, nor among elderly British women given only 800IU when 6,000IU is needed. 5-HTP (an amino acid that helps to produce serotonin, and is often used to help those with depression) has also been suggested as a supplement that may help treat the symptoms of SAD, by lifting mood, and regulating sleep schedule for those with the condition. However, those who take antidepressants are not advised to take 5-HTP, as antidepressant medications may combine with the supplement to create dangerously high levels of serotonin – potentially resulting in serotonin syndrome.

===Other treatments===
Depending upon the patient, one treatment (e.g., lightbox) may be used in conjunction with another (e.g., medication).

Negative air ionization, which involves releasing charged particles into the sleep environment, has been found effective, with a 47.9% improvement if the negative ions are in sufficient density (quantity).&lt;ref name=&quot;doi 10.1001/archpsyc.55.10.875&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical exercise has shown to be an effective form of depression therapy, particularly when in addition to another form of treatment for SAD. One particular study noted marked effectiveness for treatment of depressive symptoms, when combining regular exercise with bright light therapy. Patients exposed to exercise which had been added to their treatments in 20 minutes intervals on the aerobic bike during the day, along with the same amount of time underneath the UV light were seen to make a quick recovery.

Of all the psychological therapies aimed at the prevention of SAD, cognitive-behaviour therapy, typically involving thought records, activity schedules and a positive data log, has been the subject of the most empirical work. However, evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy or any of the psychological therapies aimed at preventing SAD remains inconclusive.

==Epidemiology==

===Nordic countries===
Winter depression is a common slump in the mood of some inhabitants of most of the Nordic countries. Iceland, however, seems to be an exception. A study of more than 2000 people there found the prevalence of seasonal affective disorder and seasonal changes in anxiety and depression to be unexpectedly &quot;low&quot; in both sexes. The study&#x27;s authors suggested that propensity for SAD may differ due to some genetic factor within the Icelandic population. A study of Canadians of wholly Icelandic descent also showed low levels of SAD. It has more recently been suggested that this may be attributed to the large amount of fish traditionally eaten by Icelandic people. In 2007, about 90 kilograms of fish per person was consumed per year in Iceland, as opposed to about 24 kilograms in the US and Canada, rather than to genetic predisposition; a similar anomaly is noted in Japan, where annual fish consumption in recent years averages about 60 kilograms per capita. Fish are high in vitamin D. Fish also contain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which helps with a variety of neurological dysfunctions.

===Other countries===
In the United States, a diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder was first proposed by Norman E. Rosenthal, M.D. in 1984. Rosenthal wondered why he became sluggish during the winter after moving from sunny South Africa to (cloudy in winter) New York. He started experimenting with increasing exposure to artificial light, and found this made a difference. In Alaska it has been established that there is a SAD rate of 8.9%, and an even greater rate of 24.9% for subsyndromal SAD.

Around 20% of Irish people are affected by SAD, according to a survey conducted in 2007. The survey also shows women are more likely to be affected by SAD than men. An estimated 3% of the population in the Netherlands experience winter SAD.

<doc id="66818" wikidata="Q937876" url="?curid=66818" title="Comarques of Catalonia">
<text>The comarques of Catalonia (singular &quot;comarca&quot;, , ), often referred to in English as counties, are an administrative division of Catalonia. Each comarca comprises a number of municipalities, roughly equivalent to a county in the United States. Currently, Catalonia is divided into 42 comarques and Aran, considered a &quot;unique territorial entity&quot; and not a comarca.

Each comarca has a representative county council (), except for Barcelonès, which abolished it in 2019, and Aran, which instead has the Conselh Generau d&#x27;Aran.

Comarques form the second-level administrative division within Catalonia, being a subdivision of vegueries (or provinces at state level).

Comarques of Catalonia


















== Overview ==

Although today the comarques are officially defined under a Catalan parliamentary act, for centuries they had existed unofficially, with citizens identifying with a particular comarca in the same way that people in other parts of the world might identify with a particular region.

In some cases, comarques consist of rural areas and many small villages centring on an important town, where the people of the region traditionally go to shop or to sell their goods. This is the case of comarques such as the Pla de l&#x27;Estany, centred on the town of Banyoles, or the Ripollès, centred on the town of Ripoll. In other cases, comarques are larger areas with many important population centres that have traditionally been considered part of the same region, as in the case of the Empordà or Vallès.

The current official division of Catalonia into comarques originates in an order of the autonomous Catalan government under the Spanish Republic in 1936. It was superseded after the 1939 victory of Francisco Franco&#x27;s forces in the Spanish Civil War, but restored in 1987 by the re-established Generalitat of Catalonia. Since the definition of comarques is sometimes ambiguous, many new proposals have been made since the comarques were first officially designated as attempts to modify the official distribution with what some regions consider to be a traditional comarca. As a result, some revisions to the official division have been made, such as the additions of Moianès and Lluçanès to the map, in 2015 and 2023 respectively.

Comarques exist as a local government area, and have a representative county council. They are often known as &quot;counties&quot; in the English language, but this can be confused with the counties that were ruled by counts.

Borders of comarques generally do not cross those of the state-level provinces (Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, Tarragona), since the provinces are defined by the Spanish government, while comarques are defined by the Catalan government - notably in the case of Cerdanya which is split into two between the provinces of Lleida and Girona (most other cases involve only one or two municipalities).

Aran, which is included here, is officially not a comarca but a &quot;unique territorial entity&quot; with additional powers. Its current status was formalised in February 2015.

== List of comarques ==

== Comarca revisions ==
Revisions to the comarques took place in 1988 (creation of Pla d&#x27;Estany, Pla d&#x27;Urgell, and Alta Ribagorça), 1990 (various adjustments), and May 2015 (creation of Moianès). The Catalan government&#x27;s &quot;Report on the revision of Catalonia&#x27;s territorial organisation model&quot; (the ), published in 2000, recommends many more changes to comarques, which have not yet been adopted except for the 2015 creation of Moianès. The other proposed new comarques are: (capital at Camprodon), (capital at Blanes), (capital at Calaf), (capital at Ponts), and (capital at Martorell).

In a non-binding referendum in July 2015, a majority of municipalities of the Lluçanès region of Osona voted to join a proposed new comarca of that name. It was finally added to the list of Comarques on the 3rd of May 2023. 

== Northern Catalan comarques ==

There are six comarques which are often referred to as the &quot;historical comarques of Catalonia&quot;, because their present-day territory was a part of the former Principality of Catalonia, but nowadays they lie in Northern Catalonia, administered by France.

<text>In mathematics, the root mean square (abbrev. RMS,  or rms) of a set of numbers is the square root of the set&#x27;s mean square.
Given a set formula_1, its RMS is denoted as either formula_2 or formula_3. The RMS is also known as the quadratic mean (denoted formula_4), a special case of the generalized mean. The RMS of a continuous function is denoted formula_5 and can be defined in terms of an integral of the square of the function.
In estimation theory, the root-mean-square deviation of an estimator measures how far the estimator strays from the data.

==Definition==
The RMS value of a set of values (or a continuous-time waveform) is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the values, or the square of the function that defines the continuous waveform. 

In the case of a set of &quot;n&quot; values formula_6, the RMS is
:formula_7

The corresponding formula for a continuous function (or waveform) &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) defined over the interval formula_8 is
:formula_9

and the RMS for a function over all time is
:formula_10

The RMS over all time of a periodic function is equal to the RMS of one period of the function. The RMS value of a continuous function or signal can be approximated by taking the RMS of a sample consisting of equally spaced observations. Additionally, the RMS value of various waveforms can also be determined without calculus, as shown by Cartwright.

In the case of the RMS statistic of a random process, the expected value is used instead of the mean.

==In common waveforms==

If the waveform is a pure sine wave, the relationships between amplitudes (peak-to-peak, peak) and RMS are fixed and known, as they are for any continuous periodic wave. However, this is not true for an arbitrary waveform, which may not be periodic or continuous. For a zero-mean sine wave, the relationship between RMS and peak-to-peak amplitude is:
:&quot;Peak-to-peak&quot; formula_11

For other waveforms, the relationships are not the same as they are for sine waves. For example, for either a triangular or sawtooth wave:
:&quot;Peak-to-peak&quot; formula_12


===In waveform combinations===
Waveforms made by summing known simple waveforms have an RMS value that is the root of the sum of squares of the component RMS values, if the component waveforms are orthogonal (that is, if the average of the product of one simple waveform with another is zero for all pairs other than a waveform times itself).
:formula_13

Alternatively, for waveforms that are perfectly positively correlated, or &quot;in phase&quot; with each other, their RMS values sum directly.

==Uses==

===In electrical engineering===

====Current====
The RMS of an alternating electric current equals the value of constant direct current that would dissipate the same power in a resistive load.

====Voltage====

A special case of RMS of waveform combinations is:
:formula_14

where formula_15 refers to the direct current (or average) component of the signal, and formula_16 is the alternating current component of the signal.

====Average electrical power====

Electrical engineers often need to know the power, &quot;P&quot;, dissipated by an electrical resistance, &quot;R&quot;. It is easy to do the calculation when there is a constant current, &quot;I&quot;, through the resistance. For a load of &quot;R&quot; ohms, power is given by:
:formula_17

However, if the current is a time-varying function, &quot;I&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), this formula must be extended to reflect the fact that the current (and thus the instantaneous power) is varying over time. If the function is periodic (such as household AC power), it is still meaningful to discuss the &quot;average&quot; power dissipated over time, which is calculated by taking the average power dissipation:

:formula_18

So, the RMS value, &quot;I&quot;RMS, of the function &quot;I&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the constant current that yields the same power dissipation as the time-averaged power dissipation of the current &quot;I&quot;(&quot;t&quot;).

Average power can also be found using the same method that in the case of a time-varying voltage, &quot;V&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), with RMS value &quot;V&quot;RMS,
:formula_19

This equation can be used for any periodic waveform, such as a sinusoidal or sawtooth waveform, allowing us to calculate the mean power delivered into a specified load.

By taking the square root of both these equations and multiplying them together, the power is found to be:
:formula_20

Both derivations depend on voltage and current being proportional (that is, the load, &quot;R&quot;, is purely resistive). Reactive loads (that is, loads capable of not just dissipating energy but also storing it) are discussed under the topic of AC power.

In the common case of alternating current when &quot;I&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is a sinusoidal current, as is approximately true for mains power, the RMS value is easy to calculate from the continuous case equation above. If &quot;I&quot;p is defined to be the peak current, then:
:formula_21

where &quot;t&quot; is time and &quot;ω&quot; is the angular frequency (&quot;ω&quot; = 2/&quot;T&quot;, where &quot;T&quot; is the period of the wave).

Since &quot;I&quot;p is a positive constant and was to be squared within the integral:
:formula_22

Using a trigonometric identity to eliminate squaring of trig function:
:formula_23

but since the interval is a whole number of complete cycles (per definition of RMS), the sine terms will cancel out, leaving:
:formula_24

A similar analysis leads to the analogous equation for sinusoidal voltage:
:formula_25

where &quot;I&quot;P represents the peak current and &quot;V&quot;P represents the peak voltage.

Because of their usefulness in carrying out power calculations, listed voltages for power outlets (for example, 120V in the US, or 230V in Europe) are almost always quoted in RMS values, and not peak values. Peak values can be calculated from RMS values from the above formula, which implies &quot;V&quot; = &quot;V&quot;RMS × , assuming the source is a pure sine wave. Thus the peak value of the mains voltage in the USA is about 120 × , or about 170 volts. The peak-to-peak voltage, being double this, is about 340 volts. A similar calculation indicates that the peak mains voltage in Europe is about 325 volts, and the peak-to-peak mains voltage, about 650 volts.

RMS quantities such as electric current are usually calculated over one cycle. However, for some purposes the RMS current over a longer period is required when calculating transmission power losses. The same principle applies, and (for example) a current of 10 amps used for 12 hours each 24-hour day represents an average current of 5 amps, but an RMS current of 7.07 amps, in the long term.

The term &quot;RMS power&quot; is sometimes erroneously used (e.g., in the audio industry) as a synonym for &quot;mean power&quot; or &quot;average power&quot; (it is proportional to the square of the RMS voltage or RMS current in a resistive load). For a discussion of audio power measurements and their shortcomings, see Audio power.

===Speed===
In the physics of gas molecules, the root-mean-square speed is defined as the square root of the average squared-speed. The RMS speed of an ideal gas is calculated using the following equation:
:formula_26

where &quot;R&quot; represents the gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol·K), &quot;T&quot; is the temperature of the gas in kelvins, and &quot;M&quot; is the molar mass of the gas in kilograms per mole. In physics, speed is defined as the scalar magnitude of velocity. For a stationary gas, the average speed of its molecules can be in the order of thousands of km/h, even though the average velocity of its molecules is zero.

===Error===

When two data sets — one set from theoretical prediction and the other from actual measurement of some physical variable, for instance — are compared, the RMS of the pairwise differences of the two data sets can serve as a measure of how far on average the error is from 0. The mean of the absolute values of the pairwise differences could be a useful measure of the variability of the differences. However, the RMS of the differences is usually the preferred measure, probably due to mathematical convention and compatibility with other formulae.

==In frequency domain==
The RMS can be computed in the frequency domain, using Parseval&#x27;s theorem. For a sampled signal formula_27, where formula_28 is the sampling period,
:formula_29

where formula_30 and &quot;N&quot; is the sample size, that is, the number of observations in the sample and DFT coefficients.

In this case, the RMS computed in the time domain is the same as in the frequency domain:
:formula_31

==Relationship to other statistics==
The standard deviation formula_32 of a population or a waveform formula_33 is the RMS deviation of formula_33 from its arithmetic mean formula_35. They are related to the RMS value of formula_33 by 
:formula_37. 

From this it is clear that the RMS value is always greater than or equal to the average, in that the RMS includes the squared deviation (error) as well.

Physical scientists often use the term &quot;root mean square&quot; as a synonym for standard deviation when it can be assumed the input signal has zero mean, that is, referring to the square root of the mean squared deviation of a signal from a given baseline or fit. This is useful for electrical engineers in calculating the &quot;AC only&quot; RMS of a signal. Standard deviation being the RMS of a signal&#x27;s variation about the mean, rather than about 0, the DC component is removed (that is, RMS(signal) = stdev(signal) if the mean signal is 0).

<doc id="66820" wikidata="Q433035" url="?curid=66820" title="Elena Berezhnaya">
<text>Elena Viktorovna Berezhnaya (, , born 11 October 1977) is a Russian former pair skater. With partner Anton Sikharulidze, she is the 1998 and 1999 World champion, 1998 Olympic silver medalist and 2002 Olympic champion.

Berezhnaya first competed with Oleg Shliakhov for Latvia and won gold at the 1995 Trophée de France. While training together in January 1996, she suffered a serious injury, leaving her partly paralyzed and unable to speak. She recovered rapidly and began competing again in November 1996 with new partner, Anton Sikharulidze. Within two years of the accident, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze had established themselves as one of the best pair teams in the world. During their competitive career, they were coached by Tamara Moskvina at the Yubileyny Sports Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and the Ice House in Hackensack, New Jersey.

== Early life ==
Berezhnaya was born in the southern Russian town of Nevinnomyssk, her mother having moved from Voronezh and her father from beyond the Urals. She has an elder brother, Alexei, and a younger one, Ivan. Her parents divorced when she was five due to her father&#x27;s alcoholism; her mother remarried but eventually divorced again. The family also included a cousin, Nadezhda, whose parents had died.

Berezhnaya began skating at the age of four in Nevinnomyssk. At the age of 8, she began to be coached by Nina Ruchkina, who had arrived from Moscow. When Berezhnaya was 13, her coach asked her to switch from singles to pairs. Ruchkina had decided that her son, Alexander Ruchkin, should be a pair skater despite not being physically suited for the discipline – and she wanted Berezhnaya, as the smallest girl, to be his partner. Although Berezhnaya enjoyed watching pair skating, she was skeptical of the proposed partnership but Ruchkina convinced her mother that the pair would get a chance at CSKA Moscow&#x27;s skating school. The coaches at CSKA also had doubts about Ruchkin&#x27;s suitability but accepted the pair. Berezhnaya moved to Moscow, 791 miles to the north, and lived in a dormitory as her mother could not move with her. They made little progress as Ruchkin continued to struggle to lift her.

== Early career ==
After unsuccessful partnerships with Ruchkin and another skater, the 14-year-old Berezhnaya teamed with Latvian-born Oleg Shliakhov, who had been dumped by his seventh partner. The partnership went well at first, however, over time he started to become physically and verbally abusive, hitting Berezhnaya and dropping her from lifts. He decided to move to Riga, Latvia, saying they would have better and cheaper training conditions. Seeing no alternative partner, she went with him. Although not violent outside the rink, he became abusive again in training. Berezhnaya kept quiet and did not tell her mother, worrying it would worsen her poor health. She continued for her mother&#x27;s sake, &quot;I knew that she would watch me skate on TV and that it gave her strength. She was the only reason for me to continue.&quot; They trained on their own for a year as no coach wanted to take the pair but eventually found a coach unaware of Shliakhov&#x27;s reputation. They had a strong showing at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, finishing eighth. The next season they won a pair of silver medals at the 1994 Skate Canada International and 1994 Trophée de France and finished 7th at the 1995 World Championships. Having little success in keeping Shliakhov in line, their coach resigned at the end of the season.

The Latvian federation appealed to renowned coach Tamara Moskvina to take on the pair and she eventually invited them to train with her in May or June 1995. They spent a few months training in Colorado Springs, Colorado and then trained mostly at Yubileyny Sports Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia, despite the deteriorating and crowded facilities of the 1990s. Berezhnaya/Shliakhov won bronze at Skate America, gold at Trophée de France and bronze at Nations Cup. Shliakhov was well behaved for half a year, but then dropped her from a lift. Moskvina had professional psychologists work with him regularly, however, after brief periods of calm with apologies and professions of affection, he would start to slip back to his old behavior. Berezhnaya thought he showed some improvement, however, Moskvina told her it was not enough and advised her to end the partnership. Shliakhov was registered at a mental hospital in Riga.

Berezhnaya had begun to develop friendships with the other skaters at Yubileyny, becoming particularly close to Anton Sikharulidze, the 1994 and 1995 World Junior champion with Maria Petrova. Shliakhov began to perceive Sikharulidze as his rival. At the end of 1995, Shliakhov demanded that they train in Riga for three weeks in preparation for the 1996 European Championships. Sikharulidze urged her to stay in Saint Petersburg but she believed she could manage a few weeks.

On 9 January 1996, Berezhnaya was seriously injured when Shliakhov&#x27;s blade sliced into her skull while the pair were practicing a side-by-side camel spin in Riga. Two surgical operations were performed to remove bone fragments from her brain. The accident caused partial paralysis on her right side, and doctors were unsure if she would walk again. She also briefly lost the ability to speak.

During her hospitalization, Sikharulidze heard of the news, and traveled to Latvia to be with her, joining Moskvina. Berezhnaya was surprised and overjoyed to see him, but unable to speak or move. Shliakhov also arrived at the hospital with flowers but Berezhnaya did not wish to see him again. Her mother, Sikharulidze, and Moskvina took her back to Saint Petersburg, Russia where she could begin her rehabilitation. She was grateful for his support, saying she was &quot;skinny, shaved, half-alive, almost a skeleton, and Anton so tenderly cared about me. Perhaps it was his belief in me that helped me recover so quickly.&quot;

== Partnership with Anton Sikharulidze ==
Berezhnaya wished to return to the ice and doctors agreed that physical exercise would be therapeutic. On 15 March 1996, only two months after the accident, she began skating carefully with Sikharulidze&#x27;s help and Moskvina observing. Berezhnaya said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have any false dreams about the future. All I thought about was those first steps.&quot; Moskvina felt the pair looked promising, &quot;They&#x27;re a natural pair. They&#x27;ve got it – something magical.&quot;

With Berezhnaya&#x27;s condition improving, the two began to consider the possibility of a competitive career together. She had made a nearly full recovery, although her speech remained slurred requiring speech therapy. As of 2010, only a minor speech problem remained. She returned to competition in November 1996, skating with Sikharulidze at Trophée Lalique where the pair won bronze. In December, they placed fifth at Cup of Russia, and then captured the silver medal at the Russian Nationals, earning them a berth to the European Championships. In January 1997 in Paris, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze made the podium at their first Europeans together, obtaining the bronze medal. At the 1997 World Championships in March, their short program placed them provisionally in third, with two judges giving them first-place votes. However, the pair placed 12th in the long program and dropped to 9th overall.

== 1998 Olympic season ==
The next season, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze won the European Championship, defeating 1992 Olympic champion Artur Dmitriev with his new partner Oksana Kazakova, and the reigning World Champions Mandy Wötzel/Ingo Steuer. At only 20 and 21 years of age respectively, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze had established themselves as gold-medal favorites going into the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. They also won the Grand Prix Finals that year. Observers were impressed by their rapid progress. Ekaterina Gordeeva selected the pair as her and Sergei Grinkov&#x27;s skating doubles in a documentary on the legendary team after her husband&#x27;s death.

At the Olympics, the pair had one fall in the short program but their other elements were of high quality. In the long, they put themselves back in contention for the gold medal with a strong performance, until five seconds from the end when they had a surprising fall as Sikharulidze set her down from a closing star lift. Although disappointed by suddenly giving away their chance at the gold so close to the end of the program, Sikharulidze recovered from his shock and joked, &quot;It&#x27;s a new finish. If you don&#x27;t like it, we&#x27;ll change it, no problem.&quot; The quality of the rest of their skating earned them the silver medal ahead of Wötzel/Steuer, while Kazakova/Dmitriev claimed the title. Former Japanese singles skater Yuko Kawaguchi became inspired to switch to pair skating after seeing Elena Berezhnaya at the Nagano Olympics.

== Post-1998 Olympics ==
Following the Olympics, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze competed at the 1998 World Championships where they won the gold medal. Later in the year, they spent some time training at the Stamford Twin Rinks in Stamford, Connecticut. They won 1998 Skate America and 1998 NHK Trophy. In January 1999, they had to withdraw from the European Championships after the short program due to Berezhnaya having the flu. They won their second world title at the 1999 World Championships in March 1999.

The Yubileyny Sports Palace ice rink then closed for renovations, forcing the pair and Moskvina to relocate to Hackensack, New Jersey&#x27;s Ice House in the summer of 1999. Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze struggled at Skate America in October 1999, placing third, but regained their form to win Skate Canada in November. Moskvina would later admit Sikharulidze had become distracted by life in a new country and was not as focused on training. In February 2000, the pair won gold at the 2000 Europeans but were stripped of their medals after Berezhnaya tested positive for pseudoephedrine, a substance whose ban was lifted temporarily between 2004 and 2010 before being banned again. This resulted in a three-month disqualification from the date of the test, and the medal being stripped. She stated that she had taken cold medication approved by a doctor but had failed to inform the ISU as required. The pair missed the World Championships that year as a result of the disqualification.

Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze developed a rivalry with Canadians Jamie Salé and David Pelletier. The 2001 World Championships were held in Salé/Pelletier&#x27;s home country of Canada. Although Salé fell on the triple toe loop in the short program and then singled her double Axel in the long, Salé/Pelletier were awarded gold ahead of Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze. At the 2001 European Championships, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze reclaimed their title.

In autumn 2001, Sikharulidze required stitches for a long gash along his arm when his partner&#x27;s blade accidentally cut him in training just before the start of the Grand Prix season. The injury having delayed their preparations, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze used their Charlie Chaplin program at the start of the season and debuted their new long program to Meditation de Thais at the Grand Prix Final in December. The pair decided to keep their new programs for the Olympics, while their rivals abandoned their new long program, with which they had been struggling, and decided to reuse their old &quot;Love Story&quot; program. &quot;The New York Times&quot; speculated that the judging might be influenced by the crowd response, with the familiar music of Love Story having more potential to draw louder applause in North America and the judges not being immune to human reactions.

== 2002 Olympics ==
At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, both pairs skated strong short programs, after which Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze were in first and Salé/Pelletier, who had a fall at the end of their program, second. In the long program, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze skated a good program although Sikharulidze had a stumble on a jump element before quickly regaining unison with his partner. Salé/Pelletier, meanwhile, had no obvious mistakes, although their program was easier. Four judges placed the Canadians first, while five had Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze as the winners, with the Canadians receiving higher technical scores and the Russians higher presentation scores. They were awarded the gold and the Canadians the silver. The result sparked a controversy with the media emphasizing Sikharulidze&#x27;s stepout.

The International Skating Union&#x27;s Technical Committee decided to look into the matter, first approaching French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne, the only Western judge in favor of the Russian pair. She allegedly said that she had been intimidated by the head of the French skating organization into voting for the Russian pair in exchange for an advantage for the French couple in the ice dancing competition, which was to follow a few days later. A second gold medal was awarded to the Canadian pair, and the IOC and ISU decided to declare both pairs as Olympic co-champions.

== Post-competitive career ==

In May 2003, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze confirmed they had retired from competitive skating. From 2002 to 2006, they toured with Stars on Ice, then returned to Russia. Although taking time off to have two children, Berezhnaya made occasional appearances in Russian ice productions. In 2006, Berezhnaya teamed with the actor Aleksandr Nosik for the Channel One (Russia) ice show &quot;Stars on Ice&quot; (Russian: Звёзды на льду). In 2008, she was paired with the pop star Dima Bilan for the Russia 1 series &quot;Star Ice&quot; (Звёздный лёд). In 2009, she skated with the comedian Mikhail Galustyan in the Channel One series &quot;Ice Age 3&quot;. She also skated with former training mate John Zimmerman in the &quot;Kings on Ice&quot; (Короли льда) show in 2009, and with Jérôme Blanchard in &quot;Ice Heart&quot; (Ледяное сердце). In 2010, she joined another edition of &quot;Ice Age&quot;, teaming up with Igor Ugolnikov.

Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze skated together at a &quot;City Lights&quot;-themed ice show in Moscow from 14 to 17 October 2010. In late 2010 and early 2011, Berezhnaya played the White Queen in an &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; ice show in St. Petersburg and Moscow, alongside Alexei Yagudin and Tatiana Totmianina/Maxim Marinin. In autumn 2011, Berezhnaya participated in the third season of the Canadian reality program &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot;, partnered with former NHL player Curtis Leschyshyn. In November 2011, she announced her retirement from performing. Berezhnaya coaches at the Yubileyny rink in Saint Petersburg.

In September 2021 Netflix premiered docuseries Bad Sport that includes an episode (&quot;Gold War&quot;) detailing the events of the 2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal.

== Personal life ==
Sikharulidze and Berezhnaya had an on-and-off romantic relationship between 1996 and 2002; they remain close friends. With former husband Steven Cousins, Berezhnaya has a son Tristan – born 6 October 2007 in London, England – and daughter, Sofia Diana (diminutive: Sonia) – born on 21 June 2009 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. In August 2010, the children were baptized in an Orthodox church in Saint Petersburg, with Sikharulidze becoming her son&#x27;s godfather.

<text>Tortosa (, ) is the capital of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Baix Ebre, in Catalonia, Spain.

Tortosa is located at above sea level, by the Ebro river, protected on its northern side by the mountains of the Cardó Massif, of which Buinaca, one of the highest peaks, is located within Tortosa&#x27;s municipal boundary.

Before Tortosa, across the river, rise the massive Ports de Tortosa-Beseit mountains. The area around Mont Caro and other high summits are often covered with snow in the winter.

*Els Reguers, 679

The municipality includes a small exclave to the west.

==History==
Tortosa (from or , via &quot;Ṭurṭūshah&quot;) is probably identical to the ancient Hibera, capital of Ilercavonia. This may be the ancient settlement the remains of which have been found on the hill named Castillo de la Zuda. In Roman times, the town took the name Dertosa ().

Tortosa was occupied in about 714, during the Arab conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom. It remained under Muslim rule for more than 400 years. King Louis the Pious laid siege to Tortosa in 808–809, but although the city submitted he did not manage to occupy it.

The city was conquered by the Count Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona in 1148, as part of the Second Crusade. Because of the crusading appeal made by Pope Eugene III and his representative Nicholas Brakespear (the future Pope Hadrian IV), the siege received the aid of crusaders from multiple nationalities (Genovese, Anglo-Normans, Normans, Occitans, Germans, Flemish and Dutch), who were on their way to the Holy Land. The siege of Tortosa was narrated by the Genovese chronicler and diplomat Caffaro.

After its conquest, the city and its territory were divided among the victors, with multiple lands being granted to foreign crusaders and to the military and religious orders.

Tortosa also had a sizable Jewish community in the 14th and 15th centuries; vestiges of that community can be seen throughout the City. 

In the years 1413 and 1414, as an attempt to force conversion upon the Jews, Jews were forced to defend their religion in a two-week Disputation of Tortosa which took place in the Cathedral of Tortosa, which is still standing today.

Construction work on a railway line between Tortosa and Alcañiz began in 1891, to open a communication gate between this region and Aragon. The work, however, was haphazard and the first trains between Alcañiz and Tortosa began only in 1942. The last stretch between Tortosa and Sant Carles de la Ràpita was never completed before the line was terminated by Renfe in 1973.

==Main sites==
*Castle of &quot;Sant Joan&quot;, or &quot;Suda&quot;, commanding the city from a hill. Though the Romans were the first to fortify the place, the current structure dates to Muslim Caliph Abd ar-Rahman III.

In the second half of July, Tortosa celebrates the Renaissance Festival. Under the title &quot;the Splendour of a 16th Century City&quot;, the Festival commemorates, through a wide range of cultural and recreational activities, the historical period of the 16th century, one of the most interesting periods in our city&#x27;s existence.

Declared Fiesta of National Tourist Interest of Spain (2005).

== Nature park (Biosphere reserve) ==
*Ports de Tortosa-Beseit. This mountains that lie between Catalonia, Valencia and Aragon, are part of a limestone massif, characterised by its abrupt cliff faces, which has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times.

==International relations==

===Twin towns — sister cities===
Tortosa is twinned with:

* Avignon, France (1968)
* Alcañiz, Spain (1972) 
* Vercelli, Italy (2003)
* Le Puy-en-Velay, France (2005)
* Tartus, Syria (2007)
==Demography==
==Climate==
Tortosa has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) in the Köppen climate classification, bordering on a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;). Tortosa enjoys a very warm climate for its latitude. Even considering it&#x27;s located at miles inland from the coastline, this mostly happens because the city lies on the delta of the Ebro river, which acts as a natural barrier against cold fronts. Albeit being a Mediterranean climate, winter months have less precipitation than autumn (common pattern in eastern Spain), but there is still a substantial summer drought.

==Notable people==

<text>Flix () is a town in the &quot;comarca&quot; of Ribera d&#x27;Ebre, Catalonia, Spain. Situated on a promontory by the Ebro river, the town occupied an important strategic position. Situated on the Madrid–Barcelona railway line, it expanded in the early twentieth century with the construction of a hydroelectric power station in 1948 and a large chemical plant, &quot;Electroquímica de Flix&quot;.

One of the main tourist attractions is fishing in the horseshoe-shaped bend in the river (day ticket). Every year there is a large international fishing competition in Flix.

==History==

Flix was the site of a battle in the Spanish Civil War in 1938. The Battle of the Iron Bridge was fought between the International Brigades and the Fascists as part of the Battle of the Ebro. The operation was initially a success for the republicans with the construction of the iron bridge nearly complete by the 3rd Division. However at the end they had lost 3,000 soldiers and the battle. Today there is a memorial to this battle at Flix.

In 2005, the existence of a vast polluted area on the shores of the Flix Reservoir was disclosed. The environmental disaster involving large quantities of toxic waste was caused by the Ercros chemical factory, located by the shore of the artificial lake. Following this disclosure, an ambitious plan to clean up the area was drawn. This plan involves the building of containment barriers and the removal and treatment of the hazardous chemical waste.

== Demography ==
The population of Flix has grown since 1900 and peaked in the 1980s.

<text>The Chafarinas Islands ( , or , or ), also spelled Zafarin, Djaferin or Zafarani, are a group of three small Spanish islets located in the Alboran Sea off the coast of Morocco with an aggregate area of , to the east of Nador and off the Moroccan town of Ras Kebdana.

The Chafarinas Islands are one of the Spanish territories in North Africa off the Moroccan coast known as .

==History==
These offshore islands were probably the of the Romans and the of the Arabs.
They were uninhabited and unclaimed in 1848, when the French government decided to occupy them, in order to monitor the tribes living in the border area between Morocco and French Algeria. A small expedition under the command of Colonel MacMahon (the future Marshal MacMahon) left Oran by sea and by land in January 1848 to take possession of the islands. Forewarned by its consul in Oran, Spain, which also coveted the Chafarinas, quickly dispatched a warship to the islands from Malaga. When the French arrived, the Spaniards had already taken possession of the islands in the name of Queen Isabel II.

==Geography==
The Chafarinas Islands are made up of three islands (from west to east, with areas in hectares):

* Isla del Congreso (25.6 ha)
* Isla de Isabel II (15.3 ha) (with garrison)
* Isla del Rey (11.6 ha).

Under Spanish control since 1847, there is a 30-man military garrison on Isla Isabel II, the only stable population on the small archipelago, down from 426 people in 1900 and 736 people in 1910. Small numbers of scientists, anti-trafficking police, and other authorized personnel sometimes increase the population to around 50.

==Natural history==
The islands had relevance in Spanish environmentalist circles during the 1980s and 1990s, as the last individual of Mediterranean monk seal in Spanish territory lived there until it disappeared in the 1990s. Nine out of eleven of its marine invertebrates are considered endangered species and it is the home of the second largest colony of endangered Audouin&#x27;s gull in the world. The islands have been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support, as well as the Audouin&#x27;s gull colony, a breeding colony of Scopoli&#x27;s shearwaters, with some 800–1,000 breeding pairs estimated in 2001–2004.

<text> (; ) is a Spanish exclave and rocky tidal island in the western Mediterranean Sea connected to the Moroccan shore by a sandy isthmus. It is also connected to a smaller islet to the east, La Isleta, by a rocky isthmus. The tidal island was named &quot;&quot; (Rock of Badis) and was connected to the town of Badis.

, along with La Isleta, is a premodern overseas possession known as a . It is administered by the Spanish central government and has a population consisting only of a small number of Spanish military personnel.

Its border with Morocco is long, making it the shortest international land border in the world.

==Geography==
 is located southeast of Ceuta. It was a natural island in the Alboran Sea until 1930, when a huge thunderstorm washed large quantities of sand into the short channel between the island and the African continent. The channel was turned into a tombolo and the island became a peninsula, connected to the Moroccan coast by an long sandy isthmus, which is the world&#x27;s shortest single land-border segment. With a length of northwest-southeast and a width of up to , it covers about 1.9 ha (4¾ acres).

==History==


Portugal and Spain passed an agreement in 1496 in which they effectively established their zones of influence on the North African coast. As a result, Spain could occupy territory only east of . This restriction ended with the Iberian Union of Portugal and Spain in 1580 under Philip II after the 1578 Battle of Alcácer Quibir, when Spain started to take direct actions in Morocco, as in the occupation of Larache.

In 1508, Spain launched a successful expedition under the command of Pedro Navarro to take the &quot;&quot; located near Badis, held by pirates who were constantly attacking and looting the coast of southern Spain.

In 1522, Spain lost the &#x27; to a Moroccan Berber attack that resulted in the deaths of the entire Spanish garrison. Ali Abu Hassun, the new Wattasid ruler of Morocco in 1554, then gave the &#x27; to the Ottoman troops who had assisted him in gaining the throne.

The Ottomans used it as a base for corsairs operating in the region of the Strait of Gibraltar. The Sa&#x27;di sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib was alarmed by this activity, fearing that the Ottomans might use the town of &quot;Badis&quot; as a base from which to undertake the conquest of Morocco. In 1564, he forced the Moroccans to evacuate the town and the &quot;&quot;, which he handed over to the Spaniards. The Moroccan population retired to the kasbah of Senada.

In 2012, the territory was briefly assaulted by seven Moroccan activists belonging to the Committee for the Liberation of Ceuta and Melilla, whose leader was Yahya Yahya.

==Government==
 is administered directly from Madrid.

==Transportation==
The territory is reached primarily by helicopter via a helipad located on the upper sections. A landing area is located on the south end near the land entrance to .

<doc id="66836" wikidata="Q44028" url="?curid=66836" title="Broken windows theory">
<text>In criminology, the broken windows theory states that visible signs of crime, antisocial behavior and civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. The theory suggests that policing methods that target minor crimes, such as vandalism, loitering, public drinking and fare evasion, help to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness.

The theory was introduced in a 1982 article by conservative think tanks social scientists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling. It was popularized in the 1990s by New York City police commissioner William Bratton and mayor Rudy Giuliani, whose policing policies were influenced by the theory.

The theory became subject to debate both within the social sciences and the public sphere. Broken windows policing has been enforced with controversial police practices, such as the high use of stop-and-frisk in New York City in the decade up to 2013.

==Article and crime prevention==
James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling first introduced the broken windows theory in an article titled &quot;Broken Windows&quot;, in the March 1982 issue of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly:&quot;
The article received a great deal of attention and was very widely cited. A 1996 criminology and urban sociology book, &quot;Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities&quot; by George L. Kelling and Catharine Coles, is based on the article but develops the argument in greater detail. It discusses the theory in relation to crime and strategies to contain or eliminate crime from urban neighborhoods.

A successful strategy for preventing vandalism, according to the book&#x27;s authors, is to address the problems when they are small. Repair the broken windows within a short time, say, a day or a week, and the tendency is that vandals are much less likely to break more windows or do further damage. Clean up the sidewalk every day, and the tendency is for litter not to accumulate (or for the rate of littering to be much less). Problems are less likely to escalate and thus respectable residents do not flee the neighborhood.

Oscar Newman introduced defensible space theory in his 1972 book &quot;Defensible Space&quot;. He argued that although police work is crucial to crime prevention, police authority is not enough to maintain a safe and crime-free city. People in the community help with crime prevention. Newman proposed that people care for and protect spaces that they feel invested in, arguing that an area is eventually safer if the people feel a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the area. Broken windows and vandalism are still prevalent because communities simply do not care about the damage. Regardless of how many times the windows are repaired, the community still must invest some of their time to keep it safe. Residents&#x27; negligence of broken window-type decay signifies a lack of concern for the community. Newman says this is a clear sign that the society has accepted this disorder—allowing the unrepaired windows to display vulnerability and lack of defense. Malcolm Gladwell also relates this theory to the reality of New York City in his book, &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;.

Thus, the theory makes a few major claims: that improving the quality of the neighborhood environment reduces petty crime, anti-social behavior, and low-level disorder, and that major crime is also prevented as a result. Criticism of the theory has tended to focus on the latter claim.

==Theoretical explanation==
The reason the state of the urban environment may affect crime consists of three factors: social norms and conformity; the presence or lack of routine monitoring; and social signaling and signal crime.

In an anonymous urban environment, with few or no other people around, social norms and monitoring are not clearly known. Thus, individuals look for signals within the environment as to the social norms in the setting and the risk of getting caught violating those norms; one of the signals is the area&#x27;s general appearance.

Under the broken windows theory, an ordered and clean environment, one that is maintained, sends the signal that the area is monitored and that criminal behavior is not tolerated. Conversely, a disordered environment, one that is not maintained (broken windows, graffiti, excessive litter), sends the signal that the area is not monitored and that criminal behavior has little risk of detection.

The theory assumes that the landscape &quot;communicates&quot; to people. A broken window transmits to criminals the message that a community displays a lack of informal social control and so is unable or unwilling to defend itself against a criminal invasion. It is not so much the actual broken window that is important, but the message the broken window sends to people. It symbolizes the community&#x27;s defenselessness and vulnerability and represents the lack of cohesiveness of the people within. Neighborhoods with a strong sense of cohesion fix broken windows and assert social responsibility on themselves, effectively giving themselves control over their space.

The theory emphasizes the built environment, but must also consider human behavior.

Under the impression that a broken window left unfixed leads to more serious problems, residents begin to change the way they see their community. In an attempt to stay safe, a cohesive community starts to fall apart, as individuals start to spend less time in communal space to avoid potential violent attacks by strangers. The slow deterioration of a community, as a result of broken windows, modifies the way people behave when it comes to their communal space, which, in turn, breaks down community control. As rowdy teenagers, panhandlers, addicts, and prostitutes slowly make their way into a community, it signifies that the community cannot assert informal social control, and citizens become afraid that worse things will happen. As a result, they spend less time in the streets to avoid these subjects and feel less and less connected from their community, if the problems persist.

At times, residents tolerate &quot;broken windows&quot; because they feel they belong in the community and &quot;know their place&quot;. Problems, however, arise when outsiders begin to disrupt the community&#x27;s cultural fabric. That is the difference between &quot;regulars&quot; and &quot;strangers&quot; in a community. The way that &quot;regulars&quot; act represents the culture within, but strangers are &quot;outsiders&quot; who do not belong.

Consequently, daily activities considered &quot;normal&quot; for residents now become uncomfortable, as the culture of the community carries a different feel from the way that it was once.

With regard to social geography, the broken windows theory is a way of explaining people and their interactions with space. The culture of a community can deteriorate and change over time, with the influence of unwanted people and behaviors changing the landscape. The theory can be seen as people shaping space, as the civility and attitude of the community create spaces used for specific purposes by residents. On the other hand, it can also be seen as space shaping people, with elements of the environment influencing and restricting day-to-day decision making.

However, with policing efforts to remove unwanted disorderly people that put fear in the public&#x27;s eyes, the argument would seem to be in favor of &quot;people shaping space&quot;, as public policies are enacted and help to determine how one is supposed to behave. All spaces have their own codes of conduct, and what is considered to be right and normal will vary from place to place.

The concept also takes into consideration spatial exclusion and social division, as certain people behaving in a given way are considered disruptive and therefore, unwanted. It excludes people from certain spaces because their behavior does not fit the class level of the community and its surroundings. A community has its own standards and communicates a strong message to criminals, by social control, that their neighborhood does not tolerate their behavior. If, however, a community is unable to ward off would-be criminals on their own, policing efforts help.

By removing unwanted people from the streets, the residents feel safer and have a higher regard for those that protect them. People of less civility who try to make a mark in the community are removed, according to the theory.

==Concepts==
===Informal social controls===
Many claim that informal social control can be an effective strategy to reduce unruly behavior. expresses that &quot;community policing measures in the realization that informal social control exercised through everyday relationships and institutions is more effective than legal sanctions.&quot; Informal social control methods have demonstrated a &quot;get tough&quot; attitude by proactive citizens, and express a sense that disorderly conduct is not tolerated. According to Wilson and Kelling, there are two types of groups involved in maintaining order, &#x27;community watchmen&#x27; and &#x27;vigilantes&#x27;. The United States has adopted in many ways policing strategies of old European times, and at that time, informal social control was the norm, which gave rise to contemporary formal policing. Though, in earlier times, because there were no legal sanctions to follow, informal policing was primarily &#x27;objective&#x27; driven, as stated by Wilson and Kelling (1982).

 argue that improper land use can cause disorder, and the larger the public land is, the more susceptible to criminal deviance. Therefore, nonresidential spaces, such as businesses, may assume to the responsibility of informal social control &quot;in the form of surveillance, communication, supervision, and intervention&quot;. It is expected that more strangers occupying the public land creates a higher chance for disorder. Jane Jacobs can be considered one of the original pioneers of this perspective of &quot;broken windows&quot;. Much of her book, &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;, focuses on residents&#x27; and nonresidents&#x27; contributions to maintaining order on the street, and explains how local businesses, institutions, and convenience stores provide a sense of having &quot;eyes on the street&quot;.

On the contrary, many residents feel that regulating disorder is not their responsibility. Wilson and Kelling found that studies done by psychologists suggest people often refuse to go to the aid of someone seeking help, not due to a lack of concern or selfishness &quot;but the absence of some plausible grounds for feeling that one must personally accept responsibility&quot;. On the other hand, others plainly refuse to put themselves in harm&#x27;s way, depending on how grave they perceive the nuisance to be; a 2004 study observed that &quot;most research on disorder is based on individual level perceptions decoupled from a systematic concern with the disorder-generating environment.&quot; Essentially, everyone perceives disorder differently, and can contemplate seriousness of a crime based on those perceptions. However, Wilson and Kelling feel that although community involvement can make a difference, &quot;the police are plainly the key to order maintenance.&quot;

===Role of fear===
Ranasinghe argues that the concept of fear is a crucial element of broken windows theory, because it is the foundation of the theory. She also adds that public disorder is &quot;... unequivocally constructed as problematic because it is a source of fear&quot;. Fear is elevated as perception of disorder rises; creating a social pattern that tears the social fabric of a community and leaves the residents feeling hopeless and disconnected. Wilson and Kelling hint at the idea, but do not focus on its central importance. They indicate that fear was a product of incivility, not crime, and that people avoid one another in response to fear, weakening controls. Hinkle and Weisburd found that police interventions to combat minor offenses, as per the broken windows model, &quot;significantly increased the probability of feeling unsafe,&quot; suggesting that such interventions might offset any benefits of broken windows policing in terms of fear reduction.

===Comparison to &quot;zero tolerance&quot;===
Broken windows policing is sometimes described as a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policing style, including in some academic studies. Bratton and Kelling have said that broken windows policing and zero tolerance are different, and that minor offenders should receive lenient punishment.

==Critical developments==
In an earlier publication of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; released March 1982, Wilson wrote an article indicating that police efforts had gradually shifted from maintaining order to fighting crime. This indicated that order maintenance was something of the past, and soon it would seem as it has been put on the back burner. The shift was attributed to the rise of the social urban riots of the 1960s, and &quot;social scientists began to explore carefully the order maintenance function of the police, and to suggest ways of improving it—not to make streets safer (its original function) but to reduce the incidence of mass violence&quot;. Other criminologists argue between similar disconnections, for example, Garland argues that throughout the early and mid 20th century, police in American cities strived to keep away from the neighborhoods under their jurisdiction. This is a possible indicator of the out-of-control social riots that were prevalent at that time. Still many would agree that reducing crime and violence begins with maintaining social control/order.

Jane Jacobs&#x27; &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot; is discussed in detail by Ranasinghe, and its importance to the early workings of broken windows, and claims that Kelling&#x27;s original interest in &quot;minor offences and disorderly behaviour and conditions&quot; was inspired by Jacobs&#x27; work. Ranasinghe includes that Jacobs&#x27; approach toward social disorganization was centralized on the &quot;streets and their sidewalks, the main public places of a city&quot; and that they &quot;are its most vital organs, because they provide the principal visual scenes&quot;. Wilson and Kelling, as well as Jacobs, argue on the concept of civility (or the lack thereof) and how it creates lasting distortions between crime and disorder. Ranasinghe explains that the common framework of both set of authors is to narrate the problem facing urban public places. Jacobs, according to Ranasinghe, maintains that &quot;Civility functions as a means of informal social control, subject little to institutionalized norms and processes, such as the law&quot; &#x27;but rather maintained through an&#x27; &quot;intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among people... and enforced by the people themselves&quot;.

==Case studies==
===Precursor experiments===
Before the introduction of this theory by Wilson and Kelling, Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford psychologist, arranged an experiment testing the broken-window theory in 1969. Zimbardo arranged for an automobile with no license plates and the hood up to be parked idle in a Bronx neighbourhood and a second automobile, in the same condition, to be set up in Palo Alto, California. The car in the Bronx was attacked within minutes of its abandonment. Zimbardo noted that the first &quot;vandals&quot; to arrive were a family—a father, mother, and a young son—who removed the radiator and battery. Within twenty-four hours of its abandonment, everything of value had been stripped from the vehicle. After that, the car&#x27;s windows were smashed in, parts torn, upholstery ripped, and children were using the car as a playground. At the same time, the vehicle sitting idle in Palo Alto sat untouched for more than a week until Zimbardo himself went up to the vehicle and deliberately smashed it with a sledgehammer. Soon after, people joined in for the destruction, although criticism has been levelled at this claim as the destruction occurred after the car was moved to the campus of Stanford university and Zimbardo&#x27;s own students were the first to join him. Zimbardo observed that a majority of the adult &quot;vandals&quot; in both cases were primarily well dressed, Caucasian, clean-cut and seemingly respectable individuals. It is believed that, in a neighborhood such as the Bronx where the history of abandoned property and theft is more prevalent, vandalism occurs much more quickly, as the community generally seems apathetic. Similar events can occur in any civilized community when communal barriers—the sense of mutual regard and obligations of civility—are lowered by actions that suggest apathy.

===New York City===
In 1985, the New York City Transit Authority hired George L. Kelling, the author of &quot;Broken Windows&quot;, as a consultant. Kelling was later hired as a consultant to the Boston and the Los Angeles police departments.

One of Kelling&#x27;s adherents, David L. Gunn, implemented policies and procedures based on the Broken Windows Theory, during his tenure as President of the New York City Transit Authority. One of his major efforts was to lead a campaign from 1984 to 1990 to rid graffiti from New York&#x27;s subway system.

In 1990, William J. Bratton became head of the New York City Transit Police. Bratton was influenced by Kelling, describing him as his &quot;intellectual mentor&quot;. In his role, he implemented a tougher stance on fare evasion, faster arrestee processing methods, and background checks on all those arrested.

After being elected Mayor of New York City in 1993, as a Republican, Rudy Giuliani hired Bratton as his police commissioner to implement similar policies and practices throughout the city. Giuliani heavily subscribed to Kelling and Wilson&#x27;s theories. Such policies emphasized addressing crimes that negatively affect quality of life. In particular, Bratton directed the police to more strictly enforce laws against subway fare evasion, public drinking, public urination, and graffiti. Bratton also revived the New York City Cabaret Law, a previously dormant Prohibition era ban on dancing in unlicensed establishments. Throughout the late 1990s, NYPD shut down many of the city&#x27;s acclaimed night spots for illegal dancing.

According to a 2001 study of crime trends in New York City by Kelling and William Sousa, rates of both petty and serious crime fell significantly after the aforementioned policies were implemented. Furthermore, crime continued to decline for the following ten years. Such declines suggested that policies based on the Broken Windows Theory were effective. Later, in 2016, Brian Jordan Jefferson used the precedent of Kelling and Sousa&#x27;s study to conduct fieldwork in the 70th precinct of New York City, which it was corroborated that crime mitigation in the area were concerning &quot;quality of life&quot; issues, which included noise complaints and loitering. The falling crime rates throughout New York City had built a mutual relationship between residents and law enforcement in vigilance of disorderly conduct.

However, other studies do not find a cause and effect relationship between the adoption of such policies and decreases in crime. The decrease may have been part of a broader trend across the United States. The rates of most crimes, including all categories of violent crime, made consecutive declines from their peak in 1990, under Giuliani&#x27;s predecessor, David Dinkins. Other cities also experienced less crime, even though they had different police policies. Other factors, such as the 39% drop in New York City&#x27;s unemployment rate between 1992 and 1999, could also explain the decrease reported by Kelling and Sousa.

A 2017 study found that when the New York Police Department (NYPD) stopped aggressively enforcing minor legal statutes in late 2014 and early 2015 that civilian complaints of three major crimes (burglary, felony assault, and grand larceny) decreased (slightly with large error bars) during and shortly after sharp reductions in proactive policing. There was no statistically significant effect on other major crimes such as murder, rape, robbery, or grand theft auto. These results are touted as challenging prevailing scholarship as well as conventional wisdom on authority and legal compliance by implying that aggressively enforcing minor legal statutes incites more severe criminal acts.

===Albuquerque===
Albuquerque, New Mexico, instituted the Safe Streets Program in the late 1990s based on the Broken Windows Theory. The Safe Streets Program sought to deter and reduce unsafe driving and incidence of crime by saturating areas where high crime and crash rates were prevalent with law enforcement officers. Operating under the theory that American Westerners use roadways much in the same way that American Easterners use subways, the developers of the program reasoned that lawlessness on the roadways had much the same effect as it did on the New York City Subway. Effects of the program were reviewed by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and were published in a case study. The methodology behind the program demonstrates the use of deterrence theory in preventing crime.

===Lowell, Massachusetts===
In 2005, Harvard University and Suffolk University researchers worked with local police to identify 34 &quot;crime hot spots&quot; in Lowell, Massachusetts. In half of the spots, authorities cleared trash, fixed streetlights, enforced building codes, discouraged loiterers, made more misdemeanor arrests, and expanded mental health services and aid for the homeless. In the other half of the identified locations, there was no change to routine police service.

The areas that received additional attention experienced a 20% reduction in calls to the police. The study concluded that cleaning up the physical environment was more effective than misdemeanor arrests.

===Netherlands===
In 2007 and 2008, Kees Keizer and colleagues from the University of Groningen conducted a series of controlled experiments to determine if the effect of existing visible disorder (such as litter or graffiti) increased other crime such as theft, littering, or other antisocial behavior. They selected several urban locations, which they arranged in two different ways, at different times. In each experiment, there was a &quot;disorder&quot; condition in which violations of social norms as prescribed by signage or national custom, such as graffiti and littering, were clearly visible as well as a control condition where no violations of norms had taken place. The researchers then secretly monitored the locations to observe if people behaved differently when the environment was &quot;disordered&quot;. Their observations supported the theory. The conclusion was published in the journal &quot;Science&quot;: &quot;One example of disorder, like graffiti or littering, can indeed encourage another, like stealing.&quot;

=== Mexico City ===
An 18-month study by Carlos Vilalta in Mexico City showed that framework of Broken Windows Theory on homicide in suburban neighborhoods was not a direct correlation, but a &quot;concentrated disadvantage&quot; in the perception of fear and modes of crime prevention. In areas with more social disorder (such as public intoxication), an increased perception of law-abiding citizens to feel unsafe amplified the impact of homicide occurring in the neighborhood. It was also found that it was more effective in preventing instances of violent crime among people living in areas with less physical structural decay (such as graffiti), lending credence to the Broken Windows Theory basis that law enforcement is trusted more among those in areas with less disorder.

Furthering this data, a 2023 study conducted by Ricardo Massa on residency near clandestine dumpsites associated economic disenfranchisement with high physical disorder. The neighborhoods that had high concentrations of landfill waste were correlated with crimes (such as vehicle theft and robbery), and most significantly crimes related to property. In a space where property damage and neglect is normalized, a person&#x27;s response to this type of environment can also greatly be affected by their perception of their surroundings. It was also concluded that non-residents of these high-concentration areas tended to fear and avoid these locations, seeing as there was typically less surveillance and lack of community efficacy surrounding clandestine dumpsites. However, despite this fear, Massa also notes that, in this case, individual targets for crime (such as homicide or rape) were unlikely compared to the vandalism of public and private property.

==Other effects==

===Real estate===
Other side effects of better monitoring and cleaned up streets may well be desired by governments or housing agencies and the population of a neighborhood: broken windows can count as an indicator of low real estate value and may deter investors. Real estate professionals may benefit from adopting the &quot;Broken Windows Theory&quot;, because if the number of minor transgressions is monitored in a specific area, there is likely to be a reduction in major transgressions as well. This may actually increase or decrease value in a house or apartment, depending on the area. Fixing windows is, therefore, also a step of real estate development, which may lead, whether it is desired or not, to gentrification. By reducing the number of broken windows in the community, the inner cities would appear to be attractive to consumers with more capital. Eliminating danger in spaces that are notorious for criminal activity, such as downtown New York City and Chicago, would draw in investment from consumers, increase the city&#x27;s economic status, and provide a safe and pleasant image for present and future inhabitants.

===Education===
In education, the broken windows theory is used to promote order in classrooms and school cultures. The belief is that students are signaled by disorder or rule-breaking and that they in turn imitate the disorder. Several school movements encourage strict paternalistic practices to enforce student discipline. Such practices include language codes (governing slang, curse words, or speaking out of turn), classroom etiquette (sitting up straight, tracking the speaker), personal dress (uniforms, little or no jewelry), and behavioral codes (walking in lines, specified bathroom times).

From 2004 to 2006, Stephen B. Plank and colleagues from Johns Hopkins University conducted a correlational study to determine the degree to which the physical appearance of the school and classroom setting influence student behavior, particularly in respect to the variables concerned in their study: fear, social disorder, and collective efficacy. They collected survey data administered to 6th-8th students by 33 public schools in a large mid-Atlantic city. From analyses of the survey data, the researchers determined that the variables in their study are statistically significant to the physical conditions of the school and classroom setting. The conclusion, published in the &quot;American Journal of Education&quot;, was:
===Statistical evidence===
A 2015 meta-analysis of broken windows policing implementations found that disorder policing strategies, such as &quot;hot spots policing&quot; or problem-oriented policing, result in &quot;consistent crime reduction effects across a variety of violent, property, drug, and disorder outcome measures&quot;. As a caveat, the authors noted that &quot;aggressive order maintenance strategies that target individual disorderly behaviors do not generate significant crime reductions,&quot; pointing specifically to zero tolerance policing models that target singular behaviors such as public intoxication and remove disorderly individuals from the street via arrest. The authors recommend that police develop &quot;community co-production&quot; policing strategies instead of merely committing to increasing misdemeanor arrests.

==Criticism==
===Other factors===
Several studies have argued that many of the apparent successes of broken windows policing (such as New York City in the 1990s) were the result of other factors. They claim that the &quot;broken windows theory&quot; closely relates correlation with causality: reasoning prone to fallacy. David Thacher, assistant professor of public policy and urban planning at the University of Michigan, stated in a 2004 paper:
C. R. Sridhar, in his article in the &quot;Economic and Political Weekly&quot;, also challenges the theory behind broken windows policing and the idea that the policies of William Bratton and the New York Police Department was the cause of the decrease of crime rates in New York City. The policy targeted people in areas with a significant amount of physical disorder and there appeared to be a causal relationship between the adoption of broken windows policing and the decrease in crime rate. Sridhar, however, discusses other trends (such as New York City&#x27;s economic boom in the late 1990s) that created a &quot;perfect storm&quot; that contributed to the decrease of crime rate much more significantly than the application of the broken windows policy. Sridhar also compares this decrease in crime rate with other major cities that adopted various policies and determined that the broken windows policy is not as effective.

In a 2007 study called &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; in the journal &quot;Criminology and Public Policy&quot;, Harcourt and Ludwig found further evidence confirming that mean reversion fully explained the changes in crime rates in the different precincts in New York in the 1990s. Further alternative explanations that have been put forward include the waning of the crack epidemic, unrelated growth in the prison population by the Rockefeller drug laws, and that the number of males from 16 to 24 was dropping regardless of the shape of the US population pyramid.

It has also been argued that rates of major crimes also dropped in many other US cities during the 1990s, both those that had adopted broken windows policing and those that had not. It is thought that this is due to the exposure of children to environmental lead, which leads to loss of impulse control and, when they reach young adulthood, criminal acts. There appears to be a correlation between a 25-year lag between the addition and removal of lead from paint and gasoline and rises and falls in murder arrests.

In his book, Baltimore criminologist Ralph B. Taylor argues that fixing windows is only a partial and short-term solution. His data supports a materialist view: changes in physical decay, superficial social disorder, and racial composition do not lead to higher crime, but economic decline does. He contends that the example shows that real, long-term reductions in crime require that urban politicians, businesses, and community leaders work together to improve the economic fortunes of residents in high-crime areas.

In 2015, Northeastern University assistant professor Daniel T. O&#x27;Brien criticised the broken theory model. Using his Big Data based research model, he argues that the broken window model fails to capture the origins of crime in a neighbourhood. He concludes that crime comes from the social dynamics of communities and private spaces and spills into public spaces. 

===Relationship between crime and disorder===
According to a study by Robert J. Sampson and Stephen Raudenbush, the premise on which the theory operates, that social disorder and crime are connected as part of a causal chain, is faulty. They argue that a third factor, collective efficacy, &quot;defined as cohesion among residents combined with shared expectations for the social control of public space,&quot; is the cause of varying crime rates observed in an altered neighborhood environment. They also argue that the relationship between public disorder and crime rate is weak.

In the winter 2006 edition of the &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot;, Bernard Harcourt and Jens Ludwig looked at the later Department of Housing and Urban Development program that rehoused inner-city project tenants in New York into more-orderly neighborhoods. The broken windows theory would suggest that these tenants would commit less crime once moved because of the more stable conditions on the streets. However, Harcourt and Ludwig found that the tenants continued to commit crimes at the same rate. Another tack was taken by a 2010 study questioning the theory&#x27;s legitimacy concerning the subjectivity of disorder as perceived by persons living in neighborhoods. It concentrated on whether citizens view disorder as separate from crime or identical to it. The study noted that crime cannot be the result of disorder if the two are identical, agreed that disorder provided evidence of &quot;convergent validity&quot; and concluded that broken windows theory misinterprets the relationship between disorder and crime.

===Racial bias===

Broken windows policing has sometimes become associated with zealotry, which has led to critics suggesting that it encourages discriminatory behaviour. Some campaigns such as Black Lives Matter have called for an end to broken windows policing. In 2016, a Department of Justice report argued that it had led the Baltimore Police Department to discriminate against and alienate minority groups.

A central argument is that the term disorder is vague, and giving the police broad discretion to decide what disorder is will lead to discrimination. In Dorothy Roberts&#x27;s article, &quot;Foreword: Race, Vagueness, and the Social Meaning of Order Maintenance and Policing&quot;, she says that the broken windows theory in practice leads to the criminalization of communities of color, who are typically disfranchised. She underscores the dangers of vaguely written ordinances that allow for law enforcers to determine who engages in disorderly acts, which, in turn, produces a racially skewed outcome in crime statistics. Similarly, Gary Stewart wrote, &quot;The central drawback of the approaches advanced by Wilson, Kelling, and Kennedy rests in their shared blindness to the potentially harmful impact of broad police discretion on minority communities.&quot; According to Stewart, arguments for low-level police intervention, including the broken windows hypothesis, often act &quot;as cover for racist behavior&quot;.

The theory has also been criticized for its unsound methodology and its manipulation of racialized tropes. Specifically, Bench Ansfield has shown that in their 1982 article, Wilson and Kelling cited only one source to prove their central contention that disorder leads to crime: the Philip Zimbardo vandalism study (see Precursor Experiments above). But Wilson and Kelling misrepresented Zimbardo&#x27;s procedure and conclusions, dispensing with Zimbardo&#x27;s critique of inequality and community anonymity in favor of the oversimplified claim that one broken window gives rise to &quot;a thousand broken windows&quot;. Ansfield argues that Wilson and Kelling used the image of the crisis-ridden 1970s Bronx to stoke fears that &quot;all cities would go the way of the Bronx if they didn&#x27;t embrace their new regime of policing.&quot; Wilson and Kelling manipulated the Zimbardo experiment to avail themselves of the racialized symbolism found in the broken windows of the Bronx.

Robert J. Sampson argues that based on common misconceptions by the masses, it is implied that those who commit disorder and crime have a clear tie to groups suffering from financial instability and may be of minority status: &quot;The use of racial context to encode disorder does not necessarily mean that people are racially prejudiced in the sense of personal hostility.&quot; He notes that residents make a clear implication of who they believe is causing the disruption, which has been termed as implicit bias. He further states that research conducted on implicit bias and stereotyping of cultures suggests that community members hold unrelenting beliefs of African Americans and other disadvantaged minority groups, associating them with crime, violence, disorder, welfare, and undesirability as neighbors. A later study indicated that this contradicted Wilson and Kelling&#x27;s proposition that disorder is an exogenous construct that has independent effects on how people feel about their neighborhoods.

In response, Kelling and Bratton have argued that broken windows policing does not discriminate against law-abiding communities of minority groups if implemented properly. They cited &quot;Disorder and Decline: Crime and the Spiral of Decay in American Neighborhoods&quot;, a study by Wesley Skogan at Northwestern University. The study, which surveyed 13,000 residents of large cities, concluded that different ethnic groups have similar ideas as to what they would consider to be &quot;disorder&quot;.

Minority groups have tended to be targeted at higher rates by the Broken Windows style of policing. Broken Windows policies have been utilized more heavily in minority neighborhoods where low-income, poor infrastructure and social disorder were widespread, causing minority groups to perceive that they were being racially profiled under Broken Windows policing.

===Class bias===

A common criticism of broken windows policing is the argument that it criminalizes the poor and homeless. That is because the physical signs that characterize a neighborhood with the &quot;disorder&quot; that broken windows policing targets correlate with the socio-economic conditions of its inhabitants. Many of the acts that are considered legal but &quot;disorderly&quot; are often targeted in public settings and are not targeted when they are conducted in private. Therefore, those without access to a private space are frequently criminalized. Critics, such as Robert J. Sampson and Stephen Raudenbush of Harvard University, see the application of the broken windows theory in policing as a war against the poor, as opposed to a war against more serious crimes. Since minority groups in most cities are more likely to be poorer than the rest of the population, a bias against the poor would be linked to a racial bias.

According to Bruce D. Johnson, Andrew Golub, and James McCabe, applying the broken windows theory in policing and policymaking can result in development projects that decrease physical disorder but promote undesired gentrification. Often, when a city is so &quot;improved&quot; in this way, the development of an area can cause the cost of living to rise higher than residents can afford, which forces low-income people out of the area. As the space changes, the middle and upper classes, often white, begin to move into the area, resulting in the gentrification of urban, poor areas. The residents are affected negatively by such an application of the broken windows theory and end up evicted from their homes as if their presence indirectly contributed to the area&#x27;s problem of &quot;physical disorder&quot;.

===Popular press===
In &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot; (2000), economist John Lott, Jr. examined the use of the broken windows approach as well as community- and problem-oriented policing programs in cities over 10,000 in population, over two decades. He found that the impacts of these policing policies were inconsistent across different types of crime. Lott&#x27;s book has been subject to criticism, while other groups support Lott&#x27;s conclusions.

In the 2005 book &quot;Freakonomics&quot;, coauthors Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner confirm and question the notion that the broken windows theory was responsible for New York&#x27;s drop in crime, saying &quot;the pool of potential criminals had dramatically shrunk&quot;. Levitt had in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; attributed that possibility to the legalization of abortion with &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which correlated with a decrease, one generation later, in the number of delinquents in the population at large.

In his 2012 book &quot;Uncontrolled: The Surprising Payoff of Trial-and-Error for Business, Politics, and Society&quot;, Jim Manzi writes that of the randomized field trials conducted in criminology, only nuisance abatement per broken windows theory has been successfully replicated.

<doc id="66841" wikidata="Q49018" url="?curid=66841" title="Fly Away Home">
<text>Fly Away Home ( Flying Wild and Father Goose) is a 1996 family adventure drama film directed by Carroll Ballard. The film stars Anna Paquin, Jeff Daniels, and Dana Delany. &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; was released on September 13, 1996, by Columbia Pictures.

&quot;Fly Away Home&quot; dramatizes the actual experiences of Bill Lishman who, in 1986, started training Canada geese to follow his ultralight aircraft, and succeeded in leading their migration in 1993 through his program &quot;Operation Migration&quot;. The film is also based on the experience of Dr. William J. L. Sladen, a British-born zoologist and adventurer, who aided Lishman with the migration.
==Plot==
After surviving a car accident in which her mother Aliane dies, 13-year-old Amy Alden is brought from New Zealand to Ontario, Canada, by her estranged father Thomas Alden, a sculptor and inventor, to live with him and his girlfriend Susan.

When a construction crew destroys a small wilderness area near the Alden home, Amy finds an abandoned nest of 16 goose eggs. Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her father&#x27;s old barn to incubate. When the eggs hatch, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local Animal Regulation officer Glen Seifert on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have imprinted on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that a private ordinance dictates that all domestic geese must have their wings pinioned (clipped) to render them flightless. He promptly tries to demonstrate the process with one of the goslings, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them.

Thomas decides to use an ultralight aircraft he had been constructing to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry, Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own. David knows someone running a bird sanctuary in North Carolina, and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development.

Amy and Thomas practice flying the aircraft, but Igor, the weakest of the geese, who has a limp, accidentally hits the front of Amy&#x27;s aircraft and lands in an isolated forest. While the group goes off to search for the bird, Glen Seifert returns to the Alden farm and confiscates the other geese. The next day, the Aldens free the geese, and Amy leads them on their migration to North Carolina, keeping Igor strapped in her cockpit as he is unable to fly in his current condition.

Making an emergency landing at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in western New York on the south shore of Lake Ontario, Amy and Thomas almost get arrested. They become national news, with residents cheering them on.

Thomas and Amy meet an old woman with a vendetta against goose shooting, and she invites them to stay the night at her house. That night Amy asks Thomas why he rarely visited her and her mother. From her mother, she knows that her parents were artists, who tend to be selfish, and that her mother left for both of their sakes. Thomas tells her that he was afraid and angry at himself for letting them leave, so he spent the next ten years buried in his work. He apologizes to Amy.

Thirty miles before reaching the bird sanctuary, Thomas&#x27;s aircraft suffers a structural failure and crashes in a cornfield; having suffered a dislocated shoulder he tells Amy to finish the journey by herself. Thomas hitchhikes to the bird sanctuary. While waiting for the geese, Thomas, Susan, David, Barry, and many animal enthusiasts stand up to developers who are waiting to start the excavation of the site.

Amy eventually appears with the geese, much to the joy of the townspeople and Amy&#x27;s family, and to the dismay of the developers. The townspeople and the Aldens celebrate their victory. During the end credits, a note reveals that all 16 geese - including a fully recovered Igor - returned to the Aldens&#x27; farm on their own in the following spring.

==Music==
The film features the song &quot;10,000 Miles&quot; performed by Mary Chapin Carpenter. &quot;Wherever You Are&quot;, also performed by Carpenter, appears during the end credits, though it is not present in the Special Edition DVD version.

==Production==
Two farms near Lindsay in southeastern Ontario were used to recreate the Alden home. Principal photography took place in 1995. The blacksmith shop constructed onsite for the filming of &quot;The Last Buffalo&quot; at Purple Hill, Ontario, was reused as part of the Alden homestead. 

Caleb Deschanel, who had previously collaborated with director Carroll Ballard on the films &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; and &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot;, returned as director of photography for &quot;Fly Away Home&quot;.

Two gliders were featured in the film: The UFM Easy Riser and the Cosmos Trike. The Easy Riser first appears as a foot-launched biplane hang glider. True to Lishman&#x27;s real-life saga, modifications were made to improve the design including the addition of a motor and seat. Anna Paquin&#x27;s character meanwhile flies an A-frame Cosmos Trike with a mock goose head mounted to the noseplate of the airframe and a fabric wing covering painted to resemble feathers (features Lishman wanted to add to his own Trike, but never did due to time). The Cosmos Trike was reportedly chosen for its safety, superior engine power, and increased wing size (a feature that was needed to fly slow enough for the birds). 

The four-day trip home for the geese that would take them to Lake Ontario, over the Appalachians to Pennsylvania, Maryland, finally settling on the North Carolina Shores, had principal photography actually filmed nearly entirely at Port Perry and Sandbanks Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada. Additional location shots were the city-fly-through in Toronto, Ontario, standing in for Baltimore, Maryland (CGI aircraft). At the conclusion of the production, Lishman led the 60 imprinted &quot;actor-geese&quot; in migration, to winter at the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center off the coast of Georgetown, South Carolina.

While in production, the film was at first titled &quot;Flying Wild&quot;, but was changed to &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; just weeks before its release in movie theaters. The original trailer has the title &quot;Flying Wild&quot;, and can be found on certain VHS copies of &quot;Jumanji&quot; from Columbia TriStar Home Video; the French version title (&quot;L&#x27;Envolée sauvage&quot;) is the translated version of this title.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Fly Away Home&quot; returned US$25 million in the U.S. box office and US$11 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $36.5 million.

===Critical reception===
 On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100 based on 28 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In a review that awarded 3 and 1/2 stars out of 4, Roger Ebert noted: &quot;There are individual shots here almost worth the price of admission...[including] a stunning shot in which the towers of Baltimore materialize from the mist, and office workers see the little girl and her geese flying past their windows.&quot; Janet Maslin from &quot;The New York Times&quot; was similarly effusive, writing &quot;Mr. Ballard turns a potentially treacly children&#x27;s film into an exhilarating 90&#x27;s fable.&quot; Gene Shalit on the &quot;Today Show&quot; called the film &quot;a must see movie&quot;.

Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of &quot;Spirituality &amp; Practice&quot; stated, &quot;The movie adds excitement and emotion, turning into a celebration of the creative ways human beings and animals can serve, assist, and love one another.&quot;

=== Impact ===
The first production of investigative theater group The Civilians, &quot;Canard, Canard, Goose?,&quot; was inspired by rumors of animal mistreatment on &quot;Fly Away Home&quot;&#x27;s set.

==Awards==
==Home media==
&quot;Fly Away Home&quot; was more successful on home video than in theaters. The studio sold an estimated $32 million on video, receiving 75% of the revenue. The film was originally released to VHS in December 1996. A DVD release in August 2001 included the exclusive featurette by Bill Lishman, &quot;Operation Migration: Birds of a Feather&quot;, along with two documentaries: &quot;The Ultra Geese&quot; and the HBO special &quot;Leading the Flock&quot;. The DVD also provided a link to Lishman&#x27;s &quot;Operation Migration&quot; website. A companion CD audio recording of the music featured in the soundtrack was released in 1996. A Blu-ray edition of &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; was released on April 7, 2009.

<doc id="66845" wikidata="Q325403" url="?curid=66845" title="Aneurin Bevan">
<text>Aneurin&quot;Nye&quot;Bevan PC (; 15 November 1897 – 6 July 1960) was a Welsh Labour Party politician, noted for spearheading the creation of the British National Health Service during his tenure as Minister of Health in Clement Attlee&#x27;s government. He is also known for his wider contribution to the founding of the British welfare state. He was first elected as MP for Ebbw Vale in 1929, and used his Parliamentary platform to make a number of influential criticisms of Winston Churchill and his government during the Second World War. Before entering Parliament, Bevan was involved in miners&#x27; union politics and was a leading figure in the 1926 general strike. Bevan is widely regarded as one of the most influential left-wing politicians in British history.

Raised in Monmouthshire, in modern day Blaenau Gwent, by a Welsh working-class family, he was the son of a coal miner and left school at 14. Bevan first worked as a miner during his teens where he became involved in local miners&#x27; union politics. He was elected head of his Miners&#x27; Lodge when aged 19, where he frequently railed against management. He joined the Labour Party and attended Central Labour College in London. On his return to South Wales he struggled to find work, remaining unemployed for nearly three years before gaining employment as a union official, which led to him becoming a leading figure in the 1926 general strike.

In 1928, Bevan won a seat on Monmouthshire County Council and he was elected as the MP for Ebbw Vale the following year. He served as an MP for 31 years. In Parliament, he became a vocal critic of numerous other politicians from all parties, particularly Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George. After the war, Bevan was chosen as the Minister of Health in Clement Attlee&#x27;s new Labour government, becoming the youngest member of the cabinet at 47, with his remit also including housing. Inspired by the Tredegar Medical Aid Society in his hometown in South Wales, Bevan led the campaign for a National Health Service to provide medical care free at point-of-need across the UK, regardless of wealth. Despite resistance from opposition parties and the British Medical Association, the National Health Service Act 1946 was passed and launched in 1948, nationalising more than 2,500 hospitals within the United Kingdom.

Bevan was named Minister of Labour in 1951, but resigned after two months in office, when the Attlee government proposed the introduction of prescription charges for dental and vision care and decided to transfer funds from the National Insurance Fund to pay for rearmament. His influence waned after his departure, although a left-wing group within the party became known as &quot;Bevanites&quot;. Attlee and Labour were ousted from power in a snap election held six months after Bevan&#x27;s resignation, but Attlee continued on as Labour Party Leader. When Attlee retired from the leadership in 1955, Bevan unsuccessfully contested the party leadership with Hugh Gaitskell, but was appointed Shadow Colonial Secretary and later Shadow Foreign Secretary. In 1959, he was elected Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and held the post for a year until his death in 1960 from stomach cancer, at the age of 62. His death led to &quot;an outpouring of national mourning&quot;. In 2004, more than 44 years after his death, he was voted first in a list of 100 Welsh Heroes, having been credited for his contribution to the founding of the welfare state in the UK.

==Early life==
Aneurin Bevan was born on 15 November 1897 at 32 Charles Street in Tredegar, Monmouthshire, a working-class mining town, where an estimated 90 per cent of the town&#x27;s inhabitants relied on the local mines for employment. The town was situated in the South Wales Valleys and was on the northern edge of the South Wales coalfield. He was the son of coal miner David Bevan and Phoebe ( Prothero), a seamstress. David Bevan was born in Tredegar but his family had originally hailed from Carmarthenshire, and he followed his own father into the mines, starting work at 5:30am each day and returning home late in the evening. He was adept at construction and added several modern features when the family moved to 7 Charles Street, installing the first gas stove in the street, an inside toilet and running hot water.

Both Bevan&#x27;s parents were Nonconformists: his father was a Baptist and his mother a Methodist, although he became an atheist. He was converted to socialism by the writings of Robert Blatchford in &quot;The Clarion&quot; and began attending meetings of the Independent Labour Party following the founding of its branch in Tredegar. It was around this time that he first &quot;reject[ed] his chapel upbringing&quot; and became an atheist. He was a member of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion and wrote his own poems, one of which won an inter-chapel eisteddfod. Aneurin&#x27;s mother was also from Tredegar, but had English roots: her grandfather was from Hereford. Bevan&#x27;s maternal grandfather John was a blacksmith who had moved to Tredegar from Hay-on-Wye to work in the Bedwellty mines.

The couple had ten children altogether—six boys and four girls—although four died in infancy and one died at the age of eight. Aneurin Bevan attended Sirhowy Elementary School, where he achieved little. He developed a severe stammer as a child and, according to his younger sister Myfanwy, became &quot;a lonely chap&quot;, due to the need to shy away from the attention it brought him.

His father died by pneumoconiosis (a lung condition caused by long term inhalation of coal dust) but no compensation was paid to him, as it was not classed as an industrial disease under the Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act.

==Working life as a miner==
At the age of 13, in his last months of schooling, he worked as a butcher&#x27;s boy at a local store. He worked at the butcher&#x27;s for several months before leaving school, instead working in the local Ty-Trist Colliery. There he earned around ten shillings per week with most going to his parents to help support the family. He began attending fortnightly meetings of the local Plebs&#x27; League where he studied, among other things, Marxism. Bevan also joined the Tredegar branch of the South Wales Miners&#x27; Federation and became a trade union activist: he was head of his local Miners&#x27; Lodge at 19 years of age. He was called up for service during the First World War, and was briefly arrested when his sister Blodwen burnt his conscription papers and he failed to report for duty. Bevan appeared in court but was cleared when he produced confirmation that he suffered from nystagmus.

Bevan became a well-known local orator and was seen by his employers, the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company, as a troublemaker. The manager of the colliery found an excuse to get him dismissed. With the support of the Miners&#x27; Federation, the case was judged as one of victimisation and the company was forced to re-employ him. He and his brother Billy did eventually leave Ty-Tryst and worked at the Bedwellty pit, but were forced to move again after a disagreement with the site&#x27;s deputy manager over Bevan reporting information to the miner&#x27;s inspector. The pair went to work at Whitworth Colliery, but fell foul of management when Bevan refused to use cheaper second-hand timber as he deemed it unsafe. He was later fired for refusing to unload, and successfully challenged the motion but was moved to Pochin, generally considered a punishment due to the poor site conditions.

1919 saw the foundation of the Tredegar Labour Party and Bevan was selected as one of four Labour delegates to contest the West Ward in the Tredegar Urban District election. Although he was defeated, he gained attention from his peers and he won a scholarship to the Central Labour College in London, sponsored by the South Wales Miners&#x27; Federation. There, he spent two years studying economics, politics and history. He read Marxism at the college and was a brief follower of Noah Ablett, developing his left-wing political outlook. Reciting long passages by William Morris with the help of an elocution tutor, Bevan gradually began to overcome the stammer that he had since childhood. Bevan remained at the college until 1921, attending at a time when a number of his contemporaries from South Wales, including Jim Griffiths, were also students at the college. Some historians have questioned how influential the college was on his political development. He was not, apparently, one of the most diligent students, and found it difficult to follow an organised routine, including arising early for breakfast.

Bevan was one of the founding members of the &quot;Query Club&quot; with his brother Billy and Walter Conway. Conway was a local miner who had been elected to the Bedwellty Board of Guardians and offered Bevan advice on overcoming his stammer, stating &quot;if you can&#x27;t say it, you don&#x27;t know it&quot;. Bevan followed his advice, often practising his speeches to his friends to perfect his speech and wording, and remarked that Conway&#x27;s words were the &quot;best advice I ever had&quot;. The Query club started in 1920 or 1921 and they met in Tredegar. They would collect money weekly for any member who needed it. The club intended to break the hold that the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company had on the town by becoming members of pivotal groups in the community.

Upon returning home in 1921, he found that the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company refused to re-employ him. Bevan ended up in a fist fight with a group of miners who refused to strike over his rejection. Apart from a six-week period as a labourer for Tredegar Council, he did not find work until 1924 and his employer, the Bedwellty Colliery, closed down ten months later. Bevan then endured another year of unemployment, the family surviving on his sister&#x27;s wages, when his unemployment benefit was stopped due to her income, and his father&#x27;s sick pay. In February 1925, his father died of pneumoconiosis, an illness caused by the inhalation of coal dust. In 1926 he found work as a paid union official. His wage of £5 a week was paid by the members of the local Miners&#x27; Lodge. His new job arrived in time for him to head the local miners against the colliery companies during the General Strike. When the strike started on 3 May 1926, Bevan soon emerged as one of the leaders of the South Wales miners. The miners remained on strike for six months. Bevan was largely responsible for the distribution of strike pay in Tredegar and the formation of the Council of Action, an organisation that helped to raise money and provide food for the miners.

==Parliament==
===MP for Ebbw Vale===
In 1928, Bevan won a seat on Monmouthshire County Council in the Tredegar Central Division. He lost the seat in 1931, but regained it in 1932 before deciding against seeking re-election in 1934. With his success in 1928, he was picked as the Labour Party candidate for Ebbw Vale (displacing the sitting MP Evan Davies), and easily held the seat at the 1929 General Election. Bevan gained more than twice the votes of Liberal candidate William Griffiths, receiving 20,000 votes to Griffiths&#x27; 8,000. In keeping with his background, Bevan described his initial thoughts on the House of Commons as a shrine to &quot;the most conservative of all religions – ancestor worship&quot;. In Parliament, he became noticed as a harsh critic of those he felt opposed the working man and woman. His targets included the Conservative Winston Churchill and the Liberal David Lloyd George, as well as Ramsay MacDonald and Margaret Bondfield from his own Labour party (he targeted the latter for her unwillingness to increase unemployment benefits). He had solid support from his constituency, being one of the few Labour MPs to be unopposed in the 1931 General Election, and this support grew through the 1930s and the period of the Great Depression.

Soon after Bevan entered Parliament, he was briefly attracted to Smethwick Labour MP Oswald Mosley&#x27;s arguments, becoming one of the 17 signatories of the Mosley Memorandum in the context of the MacDonald government&#x27;s repeated economic crises, including the doubling of unemployment levels. In January 1931, Bevan wrote a letter to the government on behalf of the Mosley group, raising concerns over its &quot;failure to deal with unemployment&quot;. Mosley broke from the Labour Party in early 1931 to form the New Party, but Bevan refused to defect and instead announced that he had no intention of leaving the Labour Party. By 1932, Mosley&#x27;s New Party had migrated from the left over to the far-right of British politics and was rebranded as the British Union of Fascists. Bevan&#x27;s past association with Mosley would be used against him in subsequent years by his political rivals.

He married fellow Socialist MP Jennie Lee in 1934, after they met in London. Described as &quot;more left-wing than Nye&quot;, Lee became a considerable influence on Bevan&#x27;s political career. They were early supporters of the socialists in the Spanish Civil War, and Bevan visited the country in 1938. In 1936 he joined the board of the new socialist newspaper &quot;Tribune&quot;. His agitations for a united socialist front of all parties of the left (including the Communist Party of Great Britain) led to his expulsion from the Labour Party from March to November 1939 (along with Stafford Cripps, C. P. Trevelyan and three others). Bevan and Cripps had previously been threatened with disciplinary action by the party for sharing a stage with a Communist speaker, and all party members were threatened with expulsion if they were associated with the Popular Front. Bevan and another expelled MP, George Strauss, appealed against the decision. Bevan was readmitted to the party on 20 December 1939, after agreeing &quot;to refrain from conducting or taking part in campaigns in opposition to the declared policy of the Party&quot;.

He strongly criticised the National Government&#x27;s rearmament plans in the face of the rise of Nazi Germany, saying to the Labour conference in autumn 1937:

If the immediate international situation is used as an excuse to get us to drop our opposition to the rearmament programme of the Government, the next phase must be that we must desist from any industrial or political action that may disturb national unity in the face of Fascist aggression. Along that road is endless retreat, and at the end of it a voluntary totalitarian state with ourselves erecting the barbed wire around. You cannot collaborate, you cannot accept the logic of collaboration on a first class issue like rearmament, and at the same time evade the implications of collaboration all along the line when the occasion demands it.

His opposition to the Labour leadership&#x27;s approach was partly based on his view that the leadership of the Labour Party was not demanding assurances from the Government on its foreign policy as a price for the party&#x27;s support for re-armament as expressed in his speech to the Bournemouth Conference of that year: ...we should say to the country we are prepared to make whatever sacrifices are necessary, to give whatever arms are necessary to fight Fascist powers and in order to consolidate world peace...

The Labour conference voted to drop its opposition to rearmament. When Winston Churchill said that the Labour Party should refrain from giving Adolf Hitler the impression that Britain was divided, Bevan rejected this as sinister: The fear of Hitler is to be used to frighten the workers of Britain into silence. In short Hitler is to rule Britain by proxy. If we accept the contention that the common enemy is Hitler and not the British capitalist class, then certainly Churchill is right. But it means abandonment of the class struggle and the subservience of the British workers to their own employers.

===Opposition to the war-time government===
By March 1938, Bevan was writing in &quot;Tribune&quot; that Churchill&#x27;s warnings about German intentions for Czechoslovakia were &quot;a diapason of majestic harmony&quot; compared to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;thin, listless trickle&quot;. Bevan now called unsuccessfully for a Popular Front against fascism under the leadership of the Labour Party, including even anti-fascist Tories. When the government introduced voluntary national service in December 1938, Bevan argued that Labour should demand the nationalisation of the armaments industry, support the democratic government of Spain and sign an Anglo-Soviet pact in return for its support. When Labour supported the government&#x27;s scheme with no such conditions, Bevan denounced Labour for imploring the people on recruiting platforms to put themselves under the leadership of their opponents. The Military Training Act 1939 reintroduced conscription six months later, and Bevan joined the rest of the Labour Party in opposing it, calling it &quot;the complete abandonment of any hope of a successful struggle against the weight of wealth in Great Britain&quot;. He emphasised that the government had no arguments to persuade young men to fight &quot;except merely in another squalid attempt to defend themselves against the redistribution of international swag&quot;.

In August 1939 came the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggression pact between the Nazi and Soviet governments that shocked democratic governments around the world. In Parliament, Bevan argued that this was the logical outcome of the government&#x27;s foreign policy. He wanted the war to be not just a fight against fascism but a war for socialism. Bevan was relieved that the country had united against Nazi Germany in the fight against fascism to provide a common enemy away from the working class. He was a strong critic of Chamberlain, arguing that his old rival Winston Churchill should become prime minister.

During the Second World War he was one of the main leaders of the left in the Commons, opposing the wartime Coalition government. Bevan opposed the heavy censorship imposed on radio and newspapers and wartime Defence Regulation 18B, which gave the Home Secretary the powers to intern citizens. Bevan called for the nationalisation of the coal industry and advocated the opening of a Second Front in Western Europe to help the Soviet Union in its fight with Germany. In one of his most noted speeches made against Churchill, he railed that the prime minister &quot;wins debate after debate and loses battle after battle&quot;. Churchill would later label Bevan &quot;a squalid nuisance&quot;. Churchill was a frequent target of Bevan&#x27;s, who already held a dislike of him following his intervention in the Tonypandy riots and the 1926 United Kingdom general strike which Bevan considered heavy handed. Bevan believed that the key to the war was the involvement of Russia and considered Churchill was too focused on the intervention of the United States. Bevan also feared that allowing Churchill to continue unopposed and unchallenged in Parliament during the war would leave him almost unbeatable for the Labour Party in future elections. Historian Max Hastings described Bevan&#x27;s role in Parliament during the war as &quot;his figures were accurate but his scorn was at odds with the spirit of the moment—full of gratitude, as was the prime minister&quot;. His fierce opposition made him unpopular with some portions of the public at the time; his wife later described how the couple would frequently receive parcels filled with excrement at their home.

Bevan was critical of the leadership of the British Army, which he felt was class bound and inflexible. After General Neil Ritchie&#x27;s retreat across Cyrenaica early in 1942 and his disastrous defeat by General Erwin Rommel at Gazala, Bevan made one of his most memorable speeches in the Commons in support of a motion of censure against the Churchill government.

&quot;The Prime Minister must realise that in this country there is a taunt on everyone&#x27;s lips that if Rommel had been in the British Army he would still have been a sergeant ... There is a man in the British Army who flung 150,000 men across the Ebro in Spain, Michael Dunbar. He is at present a sergeant ... He was Chief of Staff in Spain, he won the Battle of the Ebro, and he is a sergeant.&quot; Dunbar had been recommended for a commission, but rejected it himself to remain with his unit.

Bevan was subject to further disciplinary action in 1944, when he deliberately voted against Labour&#x27;s stance on new defence regulations. He also voiced criticism of trade union leaders, which drew complaints from both the Miners&#x27; Federation and the Trades Union Congress. An administrative committee voted 71 to 60 in favour of retaining Bevan as an MP, although it was announced that party discipline was to be strengthened in future.

He believed that the Second World War would give Britain the opportunity to create &quot;a new society&quot;. He often quoted an 1855 passage from Karl Marx that was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1865: &quot;The redeeming feature of war is that it puts a nation to the test. As exposure to the atmosphere reduces all mummies to instant dissolution, so war passes supreme judgment upon social systems that have outlived their vitality.&quot; At the beginning of the 1945 general election campaign, Bevan told his audience that his goal was to eliminate any opposition to the Labour programme: &quot;We have been the dreamers, we have been the sufferers, now we are the builders. We enter this campaign at this general election, not merely to get rid of the Tory majority. We want the complete political extinction of the Tory Party, and twenty-five years of Labour Government.&quot;

==Government==
The 1945 general election resulted in a landslide victory for the Labour Party, giving it a large enough majority to allow the implementation of the party&#x27;s manifesto commitments and to introduce a programme of far-reaching social reforms, that were collectively dubbed the &quot;Welfare State&quot;. These reforms were achieved in the face of great financial difficulty following the war. The new Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, appointed Bevan as Minister of Health, with a remit that also covered housing. Thus, the responsibility for instituting a new and comprehensive National Health Service, as well as tackling the country&#x27;s severe post-war housing shortage, was given to Bevan, the youngest member of Attlee&#x27;s Cabinet in his first ministerial position at the age of 47. Although described in &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;an outstanding back-bench critic&quot; and &quot;one of (Labour&#x27;s) most brilliant members in debate&quot;, his appointment was regarded as a relative surprise, given his previous disciplinary issues. Bevan had clashed frequently with Attlee during his time as an MP, believing that the Labour leader failed to apply enough pressure on the Tory government during the war. He had also seen disputes with some of Attlee&#x27;s closest allies, Ernest Bevin and Herbert Morrison, who were appointed Foreign Secretary and Leader of the House respectively. However, Attlee commented that Bevan was &quot;starting with me with a clean sheet&quot; following his appointment. Bevan tested this newfound solidarity early on by arriving to a royal banquet at St James&#x27;s Palace wearing a navy lounge suit. He earned a rebuke from Attlee, but Bevan contended that his Welsh mining constituency did not send him to Parliament to &quot;dress up&quot;, and he declined to wear formal attire at further Buckingham Palace functions.

===Minister of Health (1945–1951)===

The free National Health Service was paid for directly through public money. Bevan had been inspired by the Tredegar Medical Aid Society in his hometown, where residents would pay a subscription to enable all subscribers and their dependants to have free access to medical services such as nursing or dental care. This system proved so popular that 20,000 people supported the organisation during the 1930s. Government income was increased for the welfare state expenditure by a large increase in marginal tax rates for wealthy business owners in particular, as part of what the Labour government largely saw as the redistribution of the wealth created by the working-class from the owners of large-scale industry to the workers. Having been a member of the Cottage Hospital Management Committee around 1928 and serving as chairman in 1929–30, Bevan had received an insight into the management of health services by local authorities, which proved to be a bedrock of his work in founding the National Health Service.

On the &quot;appointed day&quot;, 5 July 1948, Bevan&#x27;s National Health Service Act 1946 came into force. On the day, Bevan attended a ceremony at the Park Hospital, Trafford (now Trafford General), at which he symbolically received the keys to the hospital. The scheme was achieved having overcome political opposition from both the Conservative Party and from within his own party. Confrontation with the British Medical Association (BMA) was led by Charles Hill, who published a letter in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; describing Bevan as &quot;a complete and uncontrolled dictator&quot;. Members of the BMA had dubbed him the &quot;Tito of Tonypandy&quot;. They threatened to derail the National Health Service scheme before it had even begun, as medical practitioners continued to withhold their support just months before the launch of the service. After eighteen months of ongoing dispute between the Ministry of Health and the BMA, Bevan finally managed to win over the support of the vast majority of the medical profession by offering a couple of minor concessions, including allowing consultants to keep their own private practices and continuing to allow doctors to be paid in capitation fees rather than salaries, but without compromising the fundamental principles of his National Health Service proposals. At a dinner in late 1955 or early 1956 to celebrate the publication of the Guillebaud Report into NHS costs Bevan remarked to Julian Tudor Hart &quot;ultimately I had to stuff their mouths with gold&quot; about his handling of the consultants. This is often quoted as &quot;I stuffed their mouths with gold&quot;. Some 2,688 voluntary and municipal hospitals in England and Wales were nationalised and came under Bevan&#x27;s supervisory control as Health Minister. Two of the key elements of Bevan&#x27;s proposals were this nationalisation of the hospital services and the abolition of the sale and purchase of goodwill by general practitioners. The former aimed to provide a uniform standard of consultant led care and expertise throughout the country and to replace the patchwork of voluntary and municipal hospitals which existed at that point. The latter – sale and purchase of goodwill – often placed new entrants to the GP profession under large amounts of debt. Along with this, the Medical Practices Committee was to oversee the distribution of GP practices – a proposal which the previous Coalition Minister had withdrawn after opposition from the British Medical Association.

Bevan said:

Conservative opposition of the National Health Service scheme feared that the sudden access to free health care would be overrun. In its early stages this proved true, as the service went vastly over budget in its inaugural year, and Attlee was forced to make a radio address to the nation in an attempt to limit the strain on the system. Bevan countered that the initial overspending was down to years of underinvestment in the British medical system prior to the Second World War: by the start of the 1950s, the early overspending had come to an end.

===Housing reform===
When Bevan was made a minister in 1945, he envisaged the social housing sector as a housing service similar to the National Health Service, ensuring that everyone had access to decent and affordable homes, with people still having the option to live in owner occupation or the private sector if they so chose (with grants made available to owner-occupiers and private landlords to bring dwellings up to decent standards). The removal of the criteria of &quot;working class&quot; from local authority housing provision was seen as a first step, widening access to the council housing that was becoming an ever larger part of the UK housing stock and which made up a majority of new homes built after the war. The aim was to create new homes and communities with a place for all sections of society :

Substantial bombing damage, with over 700,000 homes needing repair in London alone, and the continued existence of pre-war slums in many parts of the country made the task of housing reform particularly challenging for Bevan. Indeed, these factors, exacerbated by post-war restrictions on the availability of building materials and skilled labour, collectively served to limit Bevan&#x27;s achievements in this area. Bevan was also limited due to his desire for new homes to be bigger and of better quality than the ones they were being built to replace, based on the recommendations of a 1943 report by the Dudley Committee, and a shortage of skilled workers to undertake the work. 1946 saw the completion of 55,600 new homes; this rose to 139,600 in 1947 and 227,600 in 1948. While this was not an insignificant achievement – the 850,000 homes built in the four years immediately after the war ended was the biggest housing programme ever introduced – Bevan&#x27;s rate of house-building was exceeded by his Conservative (indirect) successor, Harold Macmillan, who was able to complete some 300,000 new homes a year as Minister for Housing in the 1950s. These numbers were reached by lowering the quality standards originally put forward by Bevan, with council houses featuring gardens being largely dropped in favour of tower blocks and flats. Macmillan was also able to concentrate full-time on the housing crisis, instead of being obliged, like Bevan, to combine his housing portfolio with that for Health (which for Bevan took the higher priority: he once stated tongue-in-cheek that he devoted &quot;five minutes a week to housing&quot;).

At a party rally in 1948, during a speech, Bevan stated: &quot;That is why no amount of cajolery, and no attempts at ethical or social seduction, can eradicate from my heart a deep burning hatred for the Tory Party that inflicted those bitter experiences on me. So far as I am concerned they are lower than vermin. They condemned millions of first-class people to semi-starvation.&quot; The comment inspired the creation of the Vermin Club by angry Conservatives, who attacked Bevan for years for the metaphor. Labour Party deputy leader Herbert Morrison complained that Bevan&#x27;s attack had backfired, for his words &quot;did much more to make the Tories work and vote ... than Conservative Central Office could have done&quot;. It was later claimed that his words had cost Labour more than two million votes.

In 1951, with the retirement of Ernest Bevin, Bevan was a leading candidate for Foreign Secretary. Prime Minister Attlee rejected Bevan in favour of Herbert Morrison because he distrusted Bevan&#x27;s personality. In his biography of Bevan, John Campbell wrote: &quot;Bevan&#x27;s impetuous temperament, undiplomatic tone and reputation as an extreme left-winger combined to make the Foreign Office seem the last place a prudent Prime Minister would think of putting him at any time. His &#x27;vermin&#x27; speech still resonated: imagination shuddered at a repetition of that on the international stage.&quot;

===Minister of Labour and National Service (1951)===
Bevan was instead appointed Minister of Labour in January 1951 in place of George Isaacs. The move was seen by some as a sideways or backwards step, although a potential rearmament programme was expected to make the post of future importance. During his tenure, Bevan helped to secure a deal for railwaymen which provided them with a significant pay increase. However, three months after his appointment, Hugh Gaitskell introduced a proposal of prescription charges for dental care and spectacles—created to save a potential £25m to meet the financial demands imposed by the Korean War. An infuriated Bevan stated that he would never be a member of a government that imposed charges on the National Health Service. The Labour MP David Marquand has stated that the savings were introduced by Gaitskell simply to &quot;impose his will&quot; upon Bevan who he saw as a political rival. Bevan resigned from his position two weeks later, stating both the proposed changes and the increase in military expenditure that necessitated the need for such proposals. Two other ministers, John Freeman and Harold Wilson, resigned at the same time. Bevan received unanimous support for his actions from his local Labour constituency leaders.

Later the same year, the Labour Party were defeated at the general election. After Bevan left the Health ministry in 1951 he could never regain his level of success and feuded with fellow Labour leaders, using his strong political base as a weapon. Historian Kenneth O. Morgan says: &quot;Bevan alone kept the flag of left-wing socialism aloft throughout—which gave him a matchless authority amongst the constituency parties and in party conference&quot;.

==Opposition==

Bevan&#x27;s last decade saw his political position weaken year by year as he failed to find a winning issue that would make use of his skills. In 1952 Bevan published &quot;In Place of Fear&quot;, &quot;the most widely read socialist book&quot; of the period, according to a highly critical right-wing Labour MP Anthony Crosland. According to &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, the book was a &quot;dithyramb with meanderings into the many side-tracks of Mr Bevan&#x27;s private and public experience&quot;. In the opening page of the book, Bevan begins: &quot;A young miner in a South Wales colliery, my concern was with the one practical question: Where does power lie in this particular state of Great Britain, and how can it be attained by the workers?&quot;

In March 1952, a poorly prepared Bevan came off the worse in an evening Commons debate on health with Conservative backbencher Iain Macleod, whose performance led Churchill to appoint him as Minister of Health some six weeks after the debate.

Out of office, Bevan soon exacerbated the split within the Labour Party between the right and the left which weakened the party in the 1950s. For the next five years, he was the leader of the left wing of the Labour Party, who became known as Bevanites. They criticised the right-wing &quot;Gaitskellites&quot; high defence expenditure (especially for nuclear weapons), called for better relations with the Soviet Union, and opposed the party leader, Clement Attlee, on most issues. According to Richard Crossman, Bevan hated &quot;the in-fighting which you have to do in politics... He wasn&#x27;t cut out to be a leader, he was cut out to be a prophet&quot;. In April 1954, Bevan resigned from the Shadow Cabinet, having been rebuked by Attlee after accusing the Labour leader of surrendering to American pressure over a proposed multi-national defence organisation in Asia and the Pacific. He later said that he had resigned his position to &quot;call attention to the fact that their movement was in grave crisis&quot;, and stated his belief that he would have been party chairman by the following year if he had remained. In July of the same year, Bevan announced his intention to stand for election as the Treasurer of the Labour Party against Hugh Gaitskell. His nomination received a severe blow on the same day it was announced, when two unions that traditionally sided with the left, the National Union of Mineworkers and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, pledged their support for his opponent. Although unsuccessful in his bid, he did celebrate 25 years as the MP for Ebbw Vale.

In March 1955, when Britain was preparing for Operation Grapple, the testing of its first hydrogen bomb, Bevan led a revolt of 57 Labour MPs and abstained on a key vote. The Parliamentary Labour Party voted 141 to 113 to withdraw the whip from him, but it was restored within a month, due to his popularity. After the 1955 general election, Attlee retired as Labour leader. Bevan contested the leadership against both Morrison and Labour right-winger Gaitskell, but it was Gaitskell who emerged victorious with more than half of the ballots. Bevan&#x27;s remark that &quot;I know the right kind of political Leader for the Labour Party is a kind of desiccated calculating machine&quot; was assumed to refer to Gaitskell, although Bevan denied it (commenting upon Gaitskell&#x27;s record as Chancellor of the Exchequer as having &quot;proved&quot; this). Bevan also failed in a bid to become deputy leader, losing out to Jim Griffiths. He instead stood again for the role of party treasurer and was duly elected, beating George Brown.

Despite Bevan&#x27;s criticism of the new party leader, Gaitskell decided to appoint him as Shadow Colonial Secretary, and then Shadow Foreign Secretary in 1956. Bevan was as critical of Nasserist Egypt&#x27;s seizure of the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956 as he was of the subsequent Anglo-French military response. He compared Gamal Abdel Nasser with Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, from &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. He was a vocal critic of the Conservative government&#x27;s actions in the Suez Crisis, noticeably delivering high-profile speeches at a protest rally in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956, and criticising the government&#x27;s actions and arguments in the Commons on 5 December 1956. Bevan accused the government of a &quot;policy of bankruptcy and despair&quot;, stating at the Trafalgar rally: We are stronger than Egypt but there are other countries stronger than us. Are we prepared to accept for ourselves the logic we are applying to Egypt? If nations more powerful than ourselves accept the absence of principle, the anarchistic attitude of Eden and launch bombs on London, what answer have we got, what complaint have we got? If we are going to appeal to force, if force is to be the arbiter to which we appeal, it would at least make common sense to try to make sure beforehand that we have got it, even if you accept that abysmal logic, that decadent point of view.We are in fact in the position today of having appealed to force in the case of a small nation, where if it is appealed to against us it will result in the destruction of Great Britain, not only as a nation, but as an island containing living men and women. Therefore I say to Anthony [Eden], I say to the British government, there is no count at all upon which they can be defended.They have besmirched the name of Britain. They have made us ashamed of the things of which formerly we were proud. They have offended against every principle of decency and there is only one way in which they can even begin to restore their tarnished reputation and that is to get out! Get out! Get out!

Bevan dismayed many of his supporters when he suddenly reversed his opposition to nuclear weapons. Speaking at the 1957 Labour Party conference, he decried unilateral nuclear disarmament, saying &quot;It would send a British Foreign Secretary naked into the conference-chamber&quot;. This statement is often misconstrued: Bevan argued that unilateralism would result in Britain&#x27;s loss of allies, and one interpretation of his metaphor is that nakedness would come from the lack of allies, not the lack of weapons. According to the journalist Paul Routledge, Donald Bruce, a former MP and Parliamentary Private Secretary and adviser to Bevan, had told him that Bevan&#x27;s shift on the disarmament issue was the result of discussions with the Soviet government, where they advised him to push for British retention of nuclear weapons so they could possibly be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the United States.

In 1957, Bevan, Richard Crossman and the Labour Party&#x27;s General Secretary Morgan Phillips sued &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine for libel, after one of its writers described them as drinking heavily during an Italian Socialist Party conference. The article wrote that the three men:
...puzzled the Italians by their capacity to fill themselves like tanks with whisky and coffee... Although the Italians were never sure the British delegation were sober, they always attributed to them an immense political acumen.
The three won their case, and obtained financial damages of £2,500 each. Crossman later acknowledged that they had perjured themselves to do so.

Bevan was elected unopposed as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in 1959, succeeding Griffiths. His last speech in the House of Commons, in the debate of 3 November 1959 on the Queen&#x27;s Speech, referred to the difficulties of persuading the electorate to support a policy which would make them less well-off in the short term, but more prosperous in the long term.

==Death==
Bevan had said &quot;I would rather be kept alive in the efficient if cold altruism of a large hospital than expire in a gush of warm sympathy in a small one&quot;. He checked into the Royal Free Hospital in London on 27 December 1959 to undergo surgery for an ulcer, but malignant stomach cancer was discovered instead in a major operation two days later.

After a lengthy period in hospital, on 14 February 1960 Bevan returned home and announced he would not be returning to politics in the near future, so as to be able to recuperate and plan an extended holiday. In May 1960 Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, while in England visited Bevan at his home in Asheridge Farm (where Bevan was a keen amateur farmer, keeping cattle and pigs).

Bevan died in his sleep at 4.10pm on 6 July 1960, at the age of 62, at his home, Asheridge Farm, Chesham, Buckinghamshire. His remains were cremated at Gwent Crematorium in Croesyceiliog in a private family ceremony. An open-air service was held in his constituency of Ebbw Vale and was presided over by Donald Soper. Jennie Lee explained in a letter to Michael Foot, who would be elected to Bevan&#x27;s seat in the by-election that ensued following his death, that Bevan had specifically chosen to have a non-religious funeral and not a Christian service, because he was a firm humanist.
In his 2014 biography, Nick Thomas-Symonds described &quot;an outpouring of national mourning&quot; that followed Bevan&#x27;s death. &quot;The Daily Herald&quot; stated that some MPs were seen to be crying in Parliament and described how there was &quot;sorrow at every street corner&quot; in the South Wales Valleys. Harold Macmillan ended his Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions session in Parliament two days after Bevan&#x27;s death by paying tribute to the opposition MP, describing him as &quot;a great personality and a great national figure&quot;. Macmillan said that despite being a &quot;controversial figure&quot; during his career, Bevan&#x27;s death had seen an outpouring of genuine &quot;admiration and affection&quot;. Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell also paid tribute to his former shadow cabinet member and ended his speech by labelling Bevan as &quot;one of the great men of our day&quot;.

==Legacy==

Bevan&#x27;s most significant legacy is the National Health Service. Bevan foresaw that it would always be the subject of public debate, warning that &quot;This service must always be changing, growing and improving; it must always appear to be inadequate.&quot; However, seven decades after it was founded, a 2013 opinion poll conducted on behalf of British Future found that the NHS was more popular than at its creation, and more popular than the monarchy, the BBC, and the British Armed Forces.

Bevan was particularly noted for his public speaking, being described by Robin Butler, Baron Butler of Brockwell, as &quot;the greatest parliamentary speaker since Charles James Fox&quot;. Winston Churchill, the target of numerous diatribes from Bevan during his career, commented that Bevan was &quot;one of the few members that I will sit still and listen to&quot;. Bevan&#x27;s reputation as a hard-line socialist typically preceded him: Sir William Douglas, who served as Bevan&#x27;s deputy in the Ministry of Health, had initially stated that he would &quot;never work with a man like that&quot;. However, by the end of his tenure, he had declared Bevan as &quot;the best minister we have had&quot;. Clement Attlee expressed his support that Bevan should have been the leader of the Labour Party during his lifetime but was held back by his demeanour, stating &quot;he wants to be two things simultaneously, rebel and official leader, and you can&#x27;t be both&quot;.

A bronze statue was commissioned by South Glamorgan County Council and erected in 1987 in the city centre of Cardiff. The Nye Bevan Estate in Clapton Park, Hackney, London, was named after Bevan, and was opened in October 1962 by his friend and biographer Michael Foot.

In November 1997 BBC One broadcast the drama profile &quot;Food for Ravens&quot;, with Brian Cox as Bevan and Sinéad Cusack as Jennie Lee.
The Aneurin Bevan Memorial Stones were erected at the beginning of the Sirhowy Valley Walk with three smaller stones (representing three towns of his constituency Ebbw Vale, Rhymney and Tredegar) surrounding a larger stone representing Bevan. In 2002, Bevan was voted as the 45th greatest Briton of all time by the BBC public opinion poll, &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot;. The following year, Bevan was voted number one in the 100 Welsh Heroes poll, a response to find the public&#x27;s favourite Welsh people of all time. Numerous institutions bear Bevan&#x27;s name, including the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, and Ysbyty Aneurin Bevan, a hospital located within his old Ebbw Vale constituency. In July 2023 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the National Health Service, Great Western Railway named a train after Bevan in a ceremony at Newport station. The train was unveiled by Aneria Thomas, the first baby born under the NHS.

In 2015, Welsh actor Michael Sheen gave a speech in which he described Bevan as a mythical creature, stating, &quot;He had cast-iron integrity and a raging passion&quot;. Sheen portrayed Bevan in Tim Price&#x27;s play &quot;Nye&quot; at the National Theatre in London from March until May 2024 and at Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff from May until June 2024. The play will be revived with Sheen reprising the role at the National Theatre and Wales Millennium Centre in July and August 2025.

In 2024, a new health centre opened in Tredegar, Bevan&#x27;s hometown. Named &quot;The Bevan Centre&quot;, it provides primary care and some secondary care to those in the catchment area of the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board.

<text>Heavy Metal is an American science fantasy comics magazine, first published in 1977. The magazine is known primarily for its blend of dark fantasy, science fiction, erotica, and steampunk comics. Following a brief hiatus in 2023, it plans to relaunch in 2024 with new owners and a new editorial team consisting of Dave Kelly, Frank Forte, and Chris Thompson.

Unlike the traditional American comic books of that time bound by the restrictive Comics Code Authority, the magazine-format &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; featured explicit nudity, sexual situations, and graphic violence. The magazine started out primarily as a licensed translation of the French science-fantasy magazine &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;, marking for many Americans their first introduction to the work of European cartoonists like Enki Bilal, Philippe Caza, Guido Crepax, Philippe Druillet, Jean-Claude Forest, Jean Giraud (a.k.a. Moebius), Chantal Montellier, and Milo Manara.

== Publication history ==
=== National Lampoon ===
After a 1975 European trip by &quot;National Lampoon&quot; contributor Tony Hendra expressing interest in European comics, the magazine&#x27;s New York offices attracted significant European comic material. On 2 September 1976, editor Sean Kelly singled out the relatively new French comics anthology &quot;Métal hurlant&quot; (, though Kelly translated it as &quot;Screaming Metal&quot;) and brought it to the attention of company president Leonard Mogel on 3 September, as Mogel was departing for Germany and France to jump-start the French edition of &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. (&quot;Métal hurlant&quot; had debuted in early 1975 from Les Humanoïdes Associés (), an association of Philippe Druillet, Jean-Pierre Dionnet, Jean Giraud (Mœbius), and financial director Bernard Farkas formed on 19 December 1974.) Upon Mogel&#x27;s return from Paris on 27 September, he reported that the French publishers had agreed to an English language version, and he suggested the title &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; for an April issue to be released in March 1977.

&quot;Heavy Metal&quot; debuted in the US as a glossy, full-color monthly published by HM Communications, Inc., a subsidiary of Matty Simmons&#x27; Twenty First Century Communications, Inc. The cover of the initial April 1977 issue declared itself to be &quot;From the people who bring you the &quot;National Lampoon&quot;&quot;, and the issue primarily featured reprints from &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;, as well as material from &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, a colorized portion of Vaughn Bodē&#x27;s &quot;Sunpot&quot; (1971), and an excerpt from Terry Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; (1977). Since the color pages from &quot;Métal hurlant&quot; had already been shot in France, the budget to reproduce them in the US version was greatly reduced.

In the late spring of 1980, &quot;Métal hurlant&quot; went bankrupt and &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; severed its ties with its content partner. &quot;Métal hurlant&quot; managed to keep publishing, however, and the two magazines reconciled in the summer of 1981.

After running as a monthly for its first nine years up to the December 1985 issue, the magazine dropped to a quarterly schedule (winter, spring, summer, and fall) beginning in 1986, promising an increase in length and to feature only complete (rather than serialized) stories.

&quot;Métal hurlant&quot; folded in the summer of 1987, forcing &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; to expand its reach for new content.

==== Other HM Communications publications ====
In 1977–1978, HM Communications published a number of trade paperbacks featuring &quot;Heavy Metal Presents&quot; on their covers, collecting translated material it had previously serialized in the pages of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;:
* &quot;Arzach&quot; (1977) — by Jean Giraud; originally published in &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;
* &quot;Candice at Sea&quot; (1977) — by Jacques Lob and Georges Pichard (trans. by Sean Kelly and Valerie Marchant); originally published in &quot;Blanche Épiphanie&quot; #3 - &quot;La Croisière infernale&quot; by Les Humanoïdes Associés in 1977
* &quot;Psychorock&quot; (1977) — by Sergio Macedo (trans. by Kelly and Marchant); originally published by Les Humanoïdes Associés in 1976
* &quot;Barbarella: The Moon Child&quot; (1978) — by Jean-Claude Forest (trans. by Richard Seaver); originally published in &quot;Barbarella&quot; #3 - &quot;Le Semble-Lune&quot;, published by Pierre Horay in 1977
* &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1978) — adaptation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; by Jacques Lob and Georges Pichard; originally published by Dargaud in 1974–1975
* &quot;Is Man Good?&quot; (1978) – by Jean Giraud (trans. by Sean Kelly and Valerie Marchant); originally published in &quot;Pilote&quot; and &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;
* &quot;Conquering Armies&quot; (1978) – by Jean-Pierre Dionnet and Jean-Claude Gal (trans. by Sean Kelly and Valerie Marchant); originally published in &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;

In 1978–1979, HM Communications released a number of graphic novels of original content, also featuring &quot;Heavy Metal Presents&quot; on their covers:
* &quot;More Than Human&quot; (1978, in association with Byron Preiss Visual Publications) – adaptation of the Theodore Sturgeon novel of the same name, by Doug Moench and Alex Niño
* &quot;1941: The Illustrated Story&quot; (1979, in association with Arrow Books) — loose adaptation of the Steven Spielberg film of the same name, by Allen Asherman, Stephen R. Bissette, and Rick Veitch, with in introduction by Spielberg; varies wildly and humorously from the film.
* &quot;&quot; (1979, with distribution by Simon &amp; Schuster) — adaptation of the Ridley Scott film of the same name, by Archie Goodwin and Walt Simonson
* &quot;Michael Moorcock&#x27;s The Swords of Heaven, The Flowers of Hell&quot; (1979) — by Michael Moorcock and Howard Chaykin
* &quot;So Beautiful and So Dangerous&quot; (1979, with distribution by Simon &amp; Schuster) — by Angus McKie
* &quot;New Tales of the Arabian Nights&quot; (1979) — by Richard Corben and Jan Strnad, introduction by Harlan Ellison

In 1981, the company launched a new series, Heavy Metal Special Editions, which consisted of fifty seasonal &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; specials published until 2008. These began with &quot;Heavy Metal Presents Moebius&quot; (1981), followed by &quot;The Best of Heavy Metal&quot; (1982), &quot;Even Heavier Metal&quot; (1983), &quot;Son of Heavy Metal&quot; (1984), &quot;Bride of Heavy Metal&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Best of Heavy Metal 2&quot; (1986). Beginning with &quot;The Venus Interface&quot; (1989, v5 no. 4), the indicia began to feature volume and issue numbers, as well as the phrase &quot;a series of special editions published four times a year by &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine.&quot; After the fiftieth issue, &quot;Overload Special&quot; (Summer 2008, v22 no. 2), the numbering of the seasonal specials was merged into the main series, and continued for another nine issues until the &quot;War of the Worlds Special&quot; (2011).

=== Grodnik/Matheson, J2 Communications ===
In late 1988/early 1989, film producer Daniel Grodnik and actor/producer Tim Matheson acquired voting control of 21.3 percent of National Lampoon Inc. stock, were named to the company&#x27;s board, and eventually took control of the company (by purchasing the ten-percent share — worth $760,000
— of Matty Simmons, who departed the company).

During this period, publication of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; increased from a quarterly to a bi-monthly schedule, citing a thirty-percent increase in circulation. 

A year later, Grodnik/Matheson Co. sold the properties to J2 Communications, a home video producer and distributor founded by James P. Jimirro, with Grodnik and Matheson staying on for a period to run the new division.

=== Kevin Eastman ===
Kevin Eastman, co-creator of the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, who had grown up reading &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, bought the magazine for $500,000 in May 1992. (In total, HM Communications published 137 issues in 15 volumes from April 1977 to March 1992.) Eastman&#x27;s publishing entity Metal Mammoth, Inc., published the magazine from 1992 to 2014. Eastman also served as &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;&#x27;s editor-in-chief for the bulk of this time (even into 2016, after he was no longer the owner).

=== Later developments ===
In January 2014, Eastman sold the magazine to digital and music veteran David Boxenbaum and film producer Jeff Krelitz. Eastman continued to serve as publisher of the magazine (until early 2020) and was a minority investor in the new &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, which became at that point published by Heavy Metal Media, LLC. 

In late 2019, Krelitz was no longer with the magazine, which was undergoing leadership churn. In early 2020, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; saw a regime change to CEO Matthew Medney and &quot;Creative Overlord&quot; David Erwin (formerly of DC Entertainment). Medney and Erwin announced two new comics publishing ventures, Virus and Magma Comix, though neither line produced much material.

&quot;Heavy Metal&quot;&#x27;s 300th issue, published in 2021, featured work by Tanino Liberatore, Mark Bodé, and Kent Williams, among others; and posthumous work by Richard Corben, Moebius, and Vaughn Bodē. It had interviews and testimonials from writers discussing the impact the magazine had on them as teenagers.

=== Cancellation ===
In the fall of 2022, the magazine entered into an agreement with online marketplace Whatnot to publish the following 12 issues of the magazine. Soon afterward, the magazine announced it was &quot;ceasing publication of what they described as the first volume of the magazine, which had been published continuously since 1977. The last issue of the first volume, number 320, was scheduled for publication in late October 2022 and the successor, Volume 2, would be published by WhatNot Publishing starting with issue 1 in February 2023.&quot;

Amid cash flow problems, however, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; shut down in December 2022. Initially intended to be a temporary suspension, the magazine worked to rectify subscription non-fulfillments and non-payments to artists and vendors. Medney stepped down as CEO, replaced by Marshall Lees and Jamie Penrose.

In July 2023, with Whatnot&#x27;s publishing division, Massive Publishing, only having produced one issue of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;—#320, released in April of that year and still listing Heavy Metal Entertainment LLC in the indicia—it was announced that the publisher had decided to cancel the magazine and that #320 had been the final issue.

=== Relaunch ===
On October 15, 2024, Heavy Metal International, LLC announced that they would be relaunching the magazine in 2025, and began a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for the first issue on November 25, 2024.

==Artists and features==
&quot;Heavy Metal&quot;″s high-quality artwork was notable. Work by international fine artists such as H. R. Giger, Frank Frazetta, and Esteban Maroto were featured on the covers of various issues. Stefano Tamburini and Tanino Liberatore&#x27;s &quot;RanXerox&quot; series debuted in the States. Terrance Lindall&#x27;s illustrated version of Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; appeared in the magazine in 1980. Many stories were presented as long-running serials, such as those by Richard Corben, Pepe Moreno and Matt Howarth. Illustrators like Luis Royo and Alex Ebel contributed artwork over the course of their careers. An adaptation of the film &quot;Alien&quot; named &quot;&quot;, written by Archie Goodwin and drawn by Walter Simonson, was published in the magazine in 1979.

Here is a starting list of contributing artists featured in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;:

* Jean &quot;Moebius&quot; Giraud

== Editors ==
The founding editors of the American edition of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; were Sean Kelly and Valerie Marchant. Over the life of the magazine, the two editors with the longest tenures were Julie Simmons-Lynch (who was publisher Matty Simmons&#x27; daughter) and Kevin Eastman, who was also the magazine&#x27;s owner/publisher for more than 20 years.

The founding design director was Peter Kleinman (who served in the same capacity for &quot;National Lampoon&quot;). He created the original &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; logo design, at the request of Mogel, and was responsible for the launch and art direction of the first issue. Kleinman later hired designer and letterer John Workman, who brought to the magazine a background of experience at DC Comics and other publishers. Workman served as the magazine&#x27;s art director from 1977 to 1984. (His comics art, writing, lettering, coloring, and design work are evident throughout issues from that period.)

Founding editors Kelly and Marchant were replaced in August 1979 by Ted White, who was hired to introduce non-fiction and prose fiction into the magazine. White was fired in August 1980, replaced as editor by magazine founder Leonard Mogel.

Julie Simmons-Lynch took over from Mogel in late 1981, serving as &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;&#x27;s editor-in-chief for more than eleven years, stepping down when Kevin Eastman bought the magazine.

With a few breaks, Eastman was chief editor for &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; from early 1993 until mid-2016. Most of these breaks were packaged and edited by A1 co-creator Dave Elliott. Comics writer Grant Morrison became the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief beginning with the April 2016 issue, serving through 2018. They later served as creative advisor.

By issue #298 (2020), Tim Seeley had become editor-in-chief but was out by the end of that year. In 2021, Joseph Illidge took over as Executive Editor but left the company entirely by the end of 2022.

Following the hiatus, all employees were let go and the company was dissolved. Heavy Metal International, LLC revived the brand in 2024 and subsequently announced new editors Dave Kelly, Frank Forte, and Chris Thompson would helm the magazine going forward.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Heavy Metal&quot; was widely credited for exposing many Americans/English-speakers to European comics and the continent&#x27;s top cartoonists. As cartoonist and publisher Kevin Eastman said of the magazine, &quot;&quot;Heavy Metal&quot; published European art that had not been previously seen in the United States, as well as demonstrating an underground comix sensibility that nonetheless wasn&#x27;t as harsh or extreme as some of the underground comix – but ... definitely intended for an older readership&quot;.

Creators like George Lucas, Neil Gaiman, and Steven Lisberger have all discussed the influence of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; on their later work.

The magazine was taken to task, however, for its juvenile stories, violence, and misogynist portrayals of women. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the magazine as, &quot;a legendary sci-fi and fantasy comic magazine for adults... and perhaps precocious teens interested in more daring material, or who consider Wonder Woman a tad underdressed.&quot; Critic R. M. Rhodes pointed out &quot;the abundance of breasts in the magazine [was] somewhat of a running joke over the years.&quot;

Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; had &quot;charm&quot; but decried its &quot;sadism.&quot; Writing about the magazine&#x27;s early years, Rhodes discussed the voluminous number of pieces in which &quot;the amount of rape (and stories where attempted rape drives the action)... I really didn&#x27;t keep track of how often it happens, but any number more than &#x27;none&#x27; is usually a bad sign. Tragically, it&#x27;s mostly used as just another plot point, with no mention or indication of the consequences.&quot;

== In other media ==
===Films===

In 1981, an animated feature film was adapted from several of the magazine&#x27;s serials. Made on a budget of U.S. $9.3 million and under production for three years, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; features animated segments from several different animation houses, with each contributing a single story segment. Another house animated the frame story which ties all the disparate stories together. Another animated feature film called &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot; was released in 2000.

During 2008 and into 2009, reports circulated that David Fincher and James Cameron would executive produce and, each, direct two of the eight to nine segments of a new animated &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; feature. Kevin Eastman was to also direct a segment, as well as animator Tim Miller, Zack Snyder, Gore Verbinski and Guillermo del Toro. Paramount Pictures decided to stop funding the film by August 2009 and no distributor or production company has shown interest in the second sequel, since. In 2011, filmmaker Robert Rodriguez purchased the film rights to &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and planned to develop a new animated film at the new Quick Draw Studios.

An animated 3D film entitled &quot;War of the Worlds: Goliath&quot;, created as a sequel to H.G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and based on a story previously published in the magazine, was produced by The Tripod Group and released in Malaysia in 2012.

The series &quot;Interceptor&quot; is being adapted into a film.

In March 2019, the Fincher project was released as a reimagining television series, titled &quot;Love, Death &amp; Robots&quot;.

In March 2021, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; announced its first move into television with an adaptation of Blake Northcott&#x27;s trilogy of novels, the &quot;Arena Mode Saga&quot;. The first book was in active development after optioning the rights to the sci-fi thriller.

===Video games===
&quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot; inspired a video game sequel released in 2000, the PC action-adventure &quot;Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.²&quot;. It was developed by Ritual Entertainment.

In 2001, Capcom released &quot;Heavy Metal: Geomatrix&quot;, an arcade fighting game that later made its way to Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast console. Though not based on any specific material from &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, it featured character designs by frequent contributor Simon Bisley and a style generally inspired by the magazine.

In 2020, Stern Pinball and the production company Incendium released a pinball machine commemorating the 300th issue of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, featuring &quot;Taarna&quot; and &quot;Cold Dead War&quot; (2021). The made to order machine, with a playfield based on the Stern &quot;Star Wars&quot; release, sold for eight-thousand dollars and shipped in late 2020 along with an exclusive variant cover edition of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; issue #300.

===Podcast network===
In 2021, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; launched a podcast network featuring scripted and unscripted shows that focused on horror, fantasy, sci-fi, comedy, and pop culture.

<text>The Conversation is a 1974 American neo-noir mystery thriller film written, produced, and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It stars Gene Hackman as a surveillance expert who faces a moral dilemma when his recordings reveal a potential murder. The cast also features John Cazale, Allen Garfield, Cindy Williams, Frederic Forrest, Harrison Ford, Teri Garr, and Robert Duvall.

&quot;The Conversation&quot; premiered at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, the festival&#x27;s highest prize, and was released theatrically on April 7, 1974, by Paramount Pictures to critical acclaim. It made $4.4 million during its original release, and after several re-releases, its total rose to $4.8 million on a $1.6 million budget. The film received three nominations at the 47th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Sound.

In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Harry Caul, a surveillance expert in San Francisco, specializes in wiretapping services. He and his team are hired by a client, who identifies himself as &quot;the Director&quot;, to eavesdrop on a couple walking through Union Square. Despite the background noise, Caul filters and merges the tapes to create a clear recording with ambiguous meaning. Caul is intensely private, obsessively guarding his own personal life, haunted by guilt from a past job that resulted in three deaths.

Despite Caul&#x27;s insistence that he is not responsible for how his clients use the surveillance, he is troubled by guilt and his Catholic faith. When he discovers a potentially dangerous phrase in the recording, &quot;He&#x27;d kill us if he got the chance,&quot; Caul becomes increasingly paranoid. His attempt to deliver the recording is thwarted, and he believes he is being followed and tricked.

After a party at his workshop, Caul spends the night with a woman, Meredith, and the tapes are stolen. He receives a call from Martin Stett, the Director&#x27;s assistant, informing him that they have the tapes and that the Director couldn&#x27;t wait any longer, so Caul must also deliver the pictures taken and collect his money in a meeting with them that same day. In that meeting, Caul learns that the woman in the recording is the Director&#x27;s wife, involved in an affair. Caul, suspecting murder, books a hotel room next to the one mentioned in the recording, and overhears a heated argument. Convinced he has overheard a murder, Caul breaks into the room; he initially finds no evidence, until he flushes the toilet and finds it clogged and overflowing with blood.

Attempting to confront the Director, Caul discovers the wife is alive and unharmed, as is her lover. A newspaper headline reveals an executive&#x27;s supposed death in a car accident, leading Caul to realize that the couple actually murdered the Director. He missed the emphasis on &quot;us&quot; in the recording, not only signifying the couple&#x27;s fear of being killed by the Director if he discovered the affair, but also their own plan to murder him first.

Stett calls Caul at his apartment, and warns him not to investigate, playing a recording of Caul&#x27;s saxophone to prove they are listening. Caul frantically searches for bugs in his apartment, destroying nearly everything in it. Caul sits alone amid the wreckage, playing his saxophone.

==Cast==
==Production==
Principal photography began November 27, 1972, and finished in late February 1973. Coppola has cited Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966) as a key influence on his conceptualization of the film&#x27;s themes, such as surveillance versus participation, and perception versus reality. &quot;Francis had seen [it] a year or two before, and had the idea to fuse the concept of &quot;Blowup&quot; with the world of audio surveillance.&quot;

On the DVD commentary, Coppola says he was shocked to learn that the film used the same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the Nixon Administration used to spy on political opponents prior to the Watergate scandal. Coppola has said this reason is partially why the film gained the recognition it has received, but it was entirely coincidental. Not only was the script for &quot;The Conversation&quot; completed in the mid-1960s, before Nixon became president, but the spying equipment used in the film was discovered through research and the use of technical advisers, and not, as many believed, by revelatory newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. Coppola also noted that filming of &quot;The Conversation&quot; had been completed several months before the most revelatory Watergate stories broke in the press. Because the film was released to theaters just a few months before Richard Nixon resigned as president, Coppola felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fall-out.

The original cinematographer of &quot;The Conversation&quot; was Haskell Wexler. Severe creative and personal differences with Coppola led to Wexler&#x27;s firing shortly after production began, and Coppola replaced him with Bill Butler, whom he&#x27;d previously worked with on &quot;The Rain People&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Wexler&#x27;s footage on &quot;The Conversation&quot; was completely reshot except for the technically complex surveillance scene in Union Square. This movie was the first of two Oscar-nominated films where Wexler would be fired and replaced by Butler, the second being &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975), where Wexler had similar problems with Miloš Forman.

Walter Murch served as the supervising editor and sound designer. Murch had more or less a free hand during the editing process because Coppola was working on &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; at the time. Coppola noted in the DVD commentary that Hackman had a very difficult time adapting to the Harry Caul character because he was so much unlike himself. Coppola says that Hackman was at the time an outgoing and approachable person who preferred casual clothes, whereas Caul was meant to be a socially awkward loner who wore a rain coat and out-of-style glasses. Coppola said that Hackman&#x27;s efforts to tap into the character made the actor moody and irritable on set, but otherwise Coppola got along well with his leading man. Coppola also notes on the commentary that Hackman considers this one of his favorite performances.

&quot;The Conversation&quot; features a piano score composed and performed by David Shire. The score was created before the film was shot. On some cues, Shire used &quot;musique concrète&quot; techniques, taking the taped sounds of the piano and distorting them in different ways to create alternative tonalities to round out the score. The score was released on CD by Intrada Records in 2001.

===Inspiration===
The character of Harry Caul was inspired by surveillance technology expert Martin Kaiser, who also served as a technical consultant on the film. According to Kaiser, the final scene of the film—in which Caul is convinced he is being eavesdropped in his apartment, cannot find the listening device, and consoles himself by playing his saxophone—was inspired by the passive covert listening devices created by Léon Theremin, such as the Great Seal bug. &quot;He couldn&#x27;t find out where [the bug] was because it was the instrument itself.&quot;

Coppola also based Caul on the protagonist of Herman Hesse&#x27;s 1927 novel &quot;Steppenwolf&quot;, Harry Haller, a &quot;total cipher&quot; who lives alone in a boarding house. Coppola also made Caul religious, originally intending the character to have a confession scene; Coppola has said that the practice of confession is &quot;one of the earliest forms of the invasion of privacy—earliest forms of surveillance.&quot;

Caul was also inspired by Karl Schnazer; a private investigator and occasional actor who appeared in Coppola&#x27;s early films &quot;Tonight for Sure&quot; and &quot;Dementia 13&quot;. Schnazer recounted to Coppola an incident where a man he had tailed for months failed to recognize him at a party, which later inspired a sequence in the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film had a $1,600,000 budget and grossed $4,420,000 in the U.S. Various rereleases over the years have brought the film&#x27;s gross to $4.8 million.

===Critical response===
The film has a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 134 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;This tense, paranoid thriller presents Francis Ford Coppola at his finest—and makes some remarkably advanced arguments about technology&#x27;s role in society that still resonate today.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert&#x27;s contemporary review gave &quot;The Conversation&quot; four out of four stars and described Hackman&#x27;s portrayal of Caul as &quot;one of the most affecting and tragic characters in the movies&quot;. In 2001, Ebert added &quot;The Conversation&quot; to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list, describing Hackman&#x27;s performance as a &quot;career peak&quot; and writing that the film &quot;comes from another time and place than today&#x27;s thrillers, which are so often simple-minded&quot;.

In 1995, &quot;The Conversation&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Gene Hackman has named the film his favorite of all those he has made. His performance in the lead role was listed as the 37th greatest in history by &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine in 2006. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed the film as the eleventh-best edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.

The film ranked 33rd on the BBC&#x27;s 2015 list of &quot;100 Greatest American Films&quot;, voted by film critics from around the world. In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked the film 8th among 69 counted winners of the Palme d&#x27;Or to date, concluding: &quot;Made in a flash between the first two &quot;Godfather&quot; movies, Coppola’s existential spy thriller has since become a pinnacle of the genre.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;The Conversation&quot; won the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, the highest honor at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. The film was also nominated for three Academy Awards for 1974, but lost to Coppola&#x27;s own &quot;The Godfather Part II.&quot; It won the National Board of Review Award for Best Film.

==In other media==
According to film critic Kim Newman, the 1998 film &quot;Enemy of the State&quot;, which also stars Gene Hackman as co-protagonist, could be construed as a &quot;continuation of &quot;The Conversation&quot;&quot;. Hackman&#x27;s character Edward Lyle in &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; closely resembles Caul: he dons the same translucent raincoat, and his workshop is nearly identical to Caul&#x27;s. Also, the photograph used for Lyle in his NSA file is actually a photograph of Caul. &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; also includes a scene which is very similar to &quot;The Conversation&quot;″s opening surveillance scene in San Francisco&#x27;s Union Square.

A television pilot starring Kyle MacLachlan as Harry Caul was produced for NBC. It was not picked up for a full series.

<doc id="66855" wikidata="Q7990031" url="?curid=66855" title="Weta (band)">
<text>Weta were a four-piece rock band from Wellington, New Zealand.

The band was formed in 1995. It supported touring bands including Everclear, Foo Fighters, and Soundgarden - after a Wellington Town Hall show, Soundgarden bassist Ben Shepherd presented Clinton Tokona with his Music Man bass guitar after falling out with it on stage.

In 1997 Aaron Tokona temporarily filled in on guitar for Adelaide, Australia band The Superjesus, after guitarist Chris Tennent left the band. When offered the position full-time, Tokona declined in order to concentrate on Weta. Impressed with his abilities as a guitarist, former Superjesus manager Dan Hennessy took a keen interest in the band and when he took over as A&amp;R chief at Warner Bros. Records Australia, Weta were added to their roster and the band moved to Melbourne, Australia in 1999.

The band&#x27;s first release came in 1998 with the &quot;Natural Compression&quot; EP, which had been recorded at Marmalade Studios in Wellington by Tim Farrant, with friend and Shihad drummer Tom Larkin producing.

September 2000 saw the New Zealand release of their debut album, &quot;Geographica&quot;.

The band broke up early in 2001, after Aaron Tokona &quot;stopped believing that I was doing what I really wanted to do. I&#x27;m not talking about playing music because I think I&#x27;ll always do music. I&#x27;m talking about playing music in the sense of being in a band or being in public.&quot; The album, recorded at Melbourne&#x27;s Sing Sing studios and produced by Steve James, was never released in Australia. The song &quot;Calling On&quot; received regular airplay on Australian radio station Triple J during 2001, however it failed to break into the station&#x27;s Hottest 100 that year.

Weta reformed and played small venues in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch and some festivals during late 2008/early 2009, but broke up again shortly afterward.

<text>The Entebbe raid, also known as the Operation Entebbe and officially codenamed Operation Thunderbolt (also retroactively codenamed Operation Yonatan), was a 1976 Israeli counter-terrorist mission in Uganda. It was launched in response to the hijacking of an international civilian passenger flight (an Airbus A300) operated by Air France between the cities of Tel Aviv and Paris. During a stopover in Athens, the aircraft was hijacked by two Palestinian PFLP–EO and two German RZ members, who diverted the flight to Libya and then to Uganda, where they landed at Entebbe International Airport to be joined by other terrorists. Once in Uganda, the group enjoyed support from Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.

A week earlier, on 27 June, an Air France Airbus A300 jet airliner with 248 passengers had been hijacked by two members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations (PFLP-EO) under orders of Wadie Haddad (who had earlier broken away from the PFLP of George Habash), and two members of the German Revolutionary Cells. The hijackers took hostages with the stated objective of compelling the release of 40 Palestinian and affiliated militants imprisoned in Israel as well as the release of 13 prisoners in four other countries. Over 100 Ugandan soldiers were deployed to support the hijackers after the flight landed, and Amin, who had been informed of the hijacking from the beginning, had personally welcomed the terrorists at Entebbe. After moving all of the hostages to a defunct airport, the hijackers separated all Israelis and several non-Israeli Jews from the larger group of passengers, subsequently moving them into a separate room. Over the next two days, 148 non-Israeli hostages were released and flown out to Paris. The 94 remaining passengers, most of whom were Israelis, and the 12-member Air France crew continued to be held as hostages. 

Representatives within the Israeli government initially debated over whether to concede or respond by force, as the hijackers had threatened to kill the 106 captives if the specified prisoners were not released. Acting on intelligence provided by Mossad, the decision was made to have the Israeli military undertake a rescue operation. The Israeli plans included preparation for an armed confrontation with Amin&#x27;s Uganda Army.

Initiating the operation at nightfall on 3 July 1976, Israeli transport planes flew 100 commandos over to Uganda for the rescue effort. Over the course of 90 minutes, 102 of the hostages were rescued successfully, with three having been killed. One of the dead hostages, Dora Bloch, was murdered by Ugandan authorities at a hospital in Kampala shortly after the Israeli rescue operation; she had fallen ill during the hijacking and was removed from the plane for treatment prior to the commandos&#x27; arrival. The Israeli military suffered five wounded and one killed; Yonatan Netanyahu was Israel&#x27;s sole fatality of Operation Entebbe, and had led Sayeret Matkal during the rescue effort – he was the older brother of Benjamin Netanyahu, who would later become Israel&#x27;s prime minister. The Israeli commandos killed all of the hijackers and 45 Ugandan soldiers, and 11 of Uganda&#x27;s MiG-17s and MiG-21s were destroyed. Over the course of the operation in Uganda, Israel received support from neighbouring Kenya. Idi Amin subsequently issued orders for the Ugandan army to kill all Kenyans living in Uganda, leading to the deaths of 245 Kenyan-Ugandans and the exodus of around 3000 Kenyans from Uganda.

==Hijacking==
On 27 June 1976, Air France Flight 139, an Airbus A300B4-203 registered as with serial number 019, departed from Tel Aviv, Israel, carrying 246 mainly Jewish and Israeli passengers and a crew of 12. The plane flew to Athens, Greece, where it picked up an additional 58 passengers, including four hijackers. It departed for Paris at 12:30 pm. Just after takeoff, the flight was hijacked by two Palestinians from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations (PFLP-EO), and by two Germans, Wilfried Böse and Brigitte Kuhlmann, from the German Revolutionary Cells. The hijackers diverted the flight to Benghazi, Libya. There it was held on the ground for seven hours for refuelling. During that time the hijackers released British-born Israeli citizen Patricia Martell, who pretended to have a miscarriage. The plane left Benghazi and at 3:15 pm on the 28 June, more than 24 hours after the flight&#x27;s original departure, it arrived at Entebbe International Airport in Uganda.

===Situation at Uganda&#x27;s Entebbe International Airport===
At Entebbe, the four hijackers were joined by at least four others, supported by the forces of Uganda&#x27;s president, Idi Amin. The hijackers transferred the passengers to the transit hall of the disused former airport terminal where they kept them under guard for the following days. Amin came to visit the hostages almost on a daily basis, updating them on developments and promising to use his efforts to have them freed through negotiations.

On 28 June, a PFLP-EO hijacker issued a declaration and formulated their demands. In addition to a ransom of US$5 million for the release of the airplane, they demanded the release of 53 Palestinian and pro-Palestinian militants, 40 of whom were prisoners in Israel. They threatened that if these demands were not met, they would begin to kill hostages on 1 July 1976.

===Separation of hostages===
On 29 June, after Ugandan soldiers had opened an entrance to a room next to the crowded waiting hall by destroying a separating wall, the hijackers separated the Israelis (including those holding dual citizenship) from the other hostages and told them to move to the adjoining room. As they did so, a Holocaust survivor showed hijacker Wilfried Böse a camp registration number tattooed on his arm. Böse protested &quot;I&#x27;m no Nazi! ... I am an idealist.&quot; In addition, five non-Israeli hostages – two ultra-orthodox Jewish couples from the US and Belgium and a French resident of Israel – were forced to join the Israeli group. According to Monique Epstein Khalepski, the French hostage among the five, the captors had singled them out for questioning and suspected them of hiding their Israeli identities. On the other hand, according to French hostage Michel Cojot-Goldberg, the captors failed to identify at least one Israeli among the passengers who was a military officer with dual citizenship then using his non-Israeli passport and he was later freed as part of the second release of non-Israeli hostages. US citizen Janet Almog, Frenchwoman Jocelyne Monier (whose husband or boyfriend was Israeli), and French-Israeli dual citizen Jean-Jacques Mimouni, whose name had not been called up during the reading of the original passport-based list, reportedly joined the Israeli hostage group by their own choice.

===Release of most non-Israeli hostages===
On 30 June, the hijackers released 48 hostages. The released were picked from among the non-Israeli group – mainly elderly and sick passengers and mothers with children. Forty-seven of them were flown by a chartered Air France Boeing 747 out of Entebbe to Paris, and one passenger was treated in hospital for a day. On 1 July, after the Israeli government had conveyed its agreement to negotiations, the hostage-takers extended their deadline to noon on 4 July and released another group of 100 non-Israeli captives who again were flown to Paris a few hours later. Among the 106 hostages staying behind with their captors at Entebbe airport were the 12 members of the Air France crew who refused to leave, about ten young French passengers, and the Israeli group of some 84 people.

==Israeli response==

=== Diplomatic efforts ===
In the week before the raid, Israel tried using political avenues to obtain the release of the hostages. Many sources indicate that the Israeli cabinet was prepared to release Palestinian prisoners if a military solution seemed unlikely to succeed. A retired IDF officer, Baruch &quot;Burka&quot; Bar-Lev, had known Idi Amin for many years and was considered to have a strong personal relationship with him. At the request of the cabinet, he spoke with Amin on the phone many times, trying to gain the release of the hostages, without success. The Israeli government also approached the United States government to deliver a message to Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, asking him to request that Amin release the hostages. Prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and defence minister Shimon Peres spent one week disagreeing on whether to give in to the hijackers&#x27; demands (Rabin&#x27;s position) or not, to prevent more terrorism (Peres&#x27; position).

At the 1 July deadline the Israeli cabinet offered to negotiate with the hijackers to extend the deadline to 4 July. Amin also asked them to extend the deadline until that date. This meant he could take a diplomatic trip to Port Louis, Mauritius, to officially hand over chairmanship of the Organisation of African Unity to Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. This extension of the hostage deadline proved crucial to providing Israeli forces enough time to get to Entebbe.

On 3 July at 18:30, the Israeli cabinet approved a rescue mission, presented by Major General Yekutiel Adam and Brigadier General Dan Shomron. Shomron was appointed as the operation commander.

===Egyptian–PLO involvement and failure of diplomacy===
As the crisis unfolded, attempts were made to negotiate the release of the hostages. According to declassified diplomatic documents, the Egyptian government under Sadat tried to negotiate with both the PLO and the Ugandan government. PLO chairman Yasser Arafat sent his political aide Hani al-Hassan to Uganda as a special envoy to negotiate with the hostage takers and with Amin. However, the PFLP-EO hijackers refused to see him.

===Israel&#x27;s military preparations===
When Israeli authorities failed to negotiate a political solution, they decided that their only option was an attack to rescue the hostages. Lt. Col. Joshua Shani, lead pilot of the operation, later said that the Israelis had initially conceived of a rescue plan that involved dropping naval commandos into Lake Victoria. The commandos would have ridden rubber boats to the airport on the edge of the lake. They planned to kill the hijackers and after freeing the hostages, they would ask Amin for passage home. The Israelis abandoned this plan because they lacked the necessary time and also because they had received word that Lake Victoria was inhabited by the Nile crocodile.

Amnon Biran, the mission&#x27;s intelligence officer, later stated that the proper layout of the airport was unknown, as was the exact location of the hostages and whether the building had been prepared with explosives.

====Aircraft refuelling====
While planning the raid, the Israeli forces had to plan how to refuel the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft they intended to use while en route to Entebbe. The Israelis lacked the logistical capacity to aerially refuel four to six aircraft so far from Israeli airspace. While several East African nations, including the logistically preferred choice Kenya, were sympathetic, none wished to incur the wrath of Amin or the Palestinians by allowing the Israelis to land their aircraft within their borders.

The raid could not proceed without assistance from at least one East African government. The Israeli government secured permission from Kenya for the IDF task force to cross Kenyan airspace and refuel at what is today Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Kenyan Minister of Agriculture Bruce MacKenzie persuaded Kenyan President Jomo Kenyatta to permit Mossad to collect intelligence prior to the operation, and to allow the Israeli Air Force access to the Nairobi airport. MacKenzie&#x27;s support for the operation came after Sir Maurice Oldfield, the then head of Britain&#x27;s MI6 intelligence agency, put his contacts in Mossad in touch with MacKenzie, who had been an MI6 contact for some time. The Jewish owner of the Block hotels chain in Kenya, along with other members of the Jewish and Israeli community in Nairobi, may also have used their political and economic influence to help persuade Kenya&#x27;s President Jomo Kenyatta to help Israel.

Uganda&#x27;s ambassador to Lesotho, Isaac Lumago, overheard some of the details of the operation from Kenya Air Force officers who were discussing the possibility of Israeli compensation for the assistance and forwarded the information to Ugandan commander Isaac Maliyamungu. Maliyamungu did not alert Amin or take any action on the intelligence, allegedly dismissing the report as &quot;gasiya&quot; (rubbish). According to Amin&#x27;s son, Jaffar Remo, the Ugandan president still managed to receive Lumago&#x27;s warning via telephone and, after completing his responsibilities at the OAU meeting, boarded a plane and flew back to Uganda. An ex-agent of Uganda&#x27;s intelligence service, the State Research Bureau, also claimed that Amin was informed by Lumago of the imminent raid. The agent stated that Amin was terrified of possible reprisals in case his troops actually fought the Israeli military, allegedly resulting in his ordering that the Uganda Army should not open fire on Israeli aircraft during a possible raid.

====Mossad intelligence====
Mossad built an accurate picture of the whereabouts of the hostages, the number of hijackers, and the involvement of Ugandan troops, based on information from the released hostages in Paris. Further, Israeli firms had been involved in construction projects in Africa during the 1960s and 1970s: while preparing the raid, the Israeli army consulted with Solel Boneh, a large Israeli construction firm that had built the terminal where the hostages were held. While planning the military operation, the IDF erected a partial replica of the airport terminal with the assistance of civilians who had helped build the original.

IDF major Muki Betser later remarked in an interview that Mossad operatives extensively interviewed the hostages who had been released. He said that a French-Jewish passenger who had a military background and &quot;a phenomenal memory&quot; had provided detailed information about the number of weapons carried by the hostage-takers.

==== Task force ====
The Israeli ground task force numbered approximately 100 personnel, and comprised the following elements:

===== Ground command and control =====
:This small group comprised the operation and overall ground commander, Brigadier General Dan Shomron, the air force representative Colonel Ami Ayalon and the communications and support personnel.

===== Assault =====
:A 29-person assault unit led by Lt. Col. Yonatan Netanyahu – this force was composed entirely of commandos from Sayeret Matkal, and was given the primary task of assaulting the old terminal and rescuing the hostages. Major Betser led one of the element&#x27;s assault teams, and took command after Lt. Col. Netanyahu was killed.

===== Securers =====
:# The Paratroopers force led by Col. Matan Vilnai – tasked with securing the civilian airport field, clearing and securing the runways, and protection and fuelling of the Israeli aircraft in Entebbe.
:# The Golani force led by Col. Uri Sagi – tasked with securing the C-130 Hercules aircraft for the hostages&#x27; evacuation, getting it as close as possible to the terminal and boarding the hostages; also with acting as general reserves.
:# The Sayeret Matkal force led by Major Shaul Mofaz – tasked with clearing the military airstrip, and destroying the squadron of MiG fighter jets on the ground, to prevent any possible interceptions by the Uganda Army Air Force; also with holding off hostile ground forces from the city of Entebbe.

==Raid==
===Attack route===
Taking off from Sharm el-Sheikh, the task force flew along the international flight path over the Red Sea, mostly flying at a height of no more than 30 m (100 ft) to avoid radar detection by Egyptian, Sudanese, and Saudi Arabian forces. Near the south outlet of the Red Sea the C-130s turned south and crossed into Ethiopian territory, passing west of Djibouti. From there, they went to a point northeast of Nairobi, Kenya. They turned west, passing through the African Rift Valley and over Lake Victoria.

Two Boeing 707 jets followed the cargo planes. The first Boeing contained medical facilities and landed at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, Kenya. The commander of the operation, General Yekutiel Adam, was on board the second Boeing, which circled over Entebbe Airport during the raid.

The Israeli forces landed at Entebbe on 3 July at 23:00 IST, with their cargo bay doors already open. Because the proper layout of the airport was not known, the first plane almost taxied into a ditch. A black Mercedes car that looked like President Idi Amin&#x27;s vehicle and Land Rovers that usually accompanied Amin&#x27;s Mercedes were brought along. The Israelis hoped they could use them to bypass security checkpoints. When the C-130s landed, Israeli assault team members drove the vehicles to the terminal building in the same fashion as Amin. As they approached the terminal, two Ugandan sentries, aware that Idi Amin had recently purchased a white Mercedes, ordered the vehicles to stop. The first commandos shot the sentries using silenced pistols. This was against the plan and against the orders – the Ugandans were to be ignored, as they were believed not to be likely to open fire at this stage. An Israeli commando in one of the following Land Rovers opened fire with an unsuppressed rifle. Fearing the hijackers would be alerted prematurely, the assault team quickly approached the terminal.

===Hostage rescue===

The Israelis left their vehicles and ran towards the terminal. The hostages were in the main hall of the airport building, directly adjacent to the runway. Entering the terminal, the commandos shouted through a megaphone, &quot;Stay down! Stay down! We are Israeli soldiers,&quot; in both Hebrew and English. Jean-Jacques Maimoni, a 19-year-old French immigrant to Israel, stood up and was killed when Muki Betser and another soldier mistook him for a hijacker and fired at him. Another hostage, Pasco Cohen, 52, was also fatally wounded by gunfire from the commandos. In addition, a third hostage, 56-year-old Ida Borochovitch, a Russian Jew who had emigrated to Israel, was killed by a hijacker in the crossfire.

According to hostage Ilan Hartuv, Wilfried Böse was the only hijacker who, after the operation began, entered the hall housing the hostages. At first he pointed his Kalashnikov rifle at hostages, but &quot;immediately came to his senses&quot; and ordered them to find shelter in the restroom, before being killed by the commandos. According to Hartuv, Böse fired only at Israeli soldiers and not at hostages.

At one point an Israeli commando called out in Hebrew, &quot;Where are the rest of them?&quot; referring to the hijackers. The hostages pointed to a connecting door of the airport&#x27;s main hall, into which the commandos threw several hand grenades. They then entered the room and shot dead the three remaining hijackers, ending the assault. Meanwhile, the other three C-130 Hercules aeroplanes had landed and unloaded armoured personnel carriers to provide defence during the anticipated hour of refuelling. The Israelis then destroyed Ugandan MiG fighter planes to prevent them from pursuing, and conducted a sweep of the airfield to gather intelligence.

===Departure===

After the raid, the Israeli assault team returned to their aircraft and began loading the hostages. Ugandan soldiers shot at them in the process. The Israeli commandos returned fire, inflicting casualties on the Ugandans. During this brief but intense firefight, Ugandan soldiers fired from the airport control tower. At least five commandos were wounded, and the Israeli unit commander, Yonatan Netanyahu, was killed. Israeli commandos fired light machine guns and a rocket-propelled grenade back at the control tower, suppressing the Ugandans&#x27; fire. According to one of Idi Amin&#x27;s sons, the soldier who shot Netanyahu, a cousin of the Amin family, was killed by return fire. The Israelis finished evacuating the hostages, loaded Netanyahu&#x27;s body into one of the planes, and left the airport. The entire operation lasted 53 minutes – of which the assault lasted only 30 minutes. All seven hijackers present, and 45 Ugandan soldiers, were killed. Eleven Soviet-built MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighter planes of the Uganda Army Air Force were destroyed on the ground at Entebbe Airport. Out of the 106 hostages, 3 were killed, 1 was left in Uganda (74-year-old Dora Bloch), and approximately 10 were wounded. The 102 rescued hostages were flown to Israel via Nairobi, Kenya, shortly after the raid.

===Ugandan reaction===
Amin was furious upon learning of the raid, and reportedly boasted that he could have taught the Israelis a lesson if he had known that they would strike. Following the raid, Maliyamungu had 14 soldiers arrested under suspicion of collaborating with the Israelis. Once they were gathered in a room at Makindye Barracks, he shot 12 of them with his pistol. Uganda Army Chief of Staff Mustafa Adrisi reportedly wanted to incarcerate or execute Godwin Sule, the Entebbe Air Base commander, who was absent from his post during the raid. Sule had left the air base early that day to meet a female companion at Lake Victoria Hotel on 4 July. Despite Adrisi&#x27;s demands, Sule&#x27;s closeness to President Amin guaranteed his safety.

==== Murder of Dora Bloch ====

Dora Bloch, a 74-year-old Israeli who also held British citizenship, was taken to Mulago Hospital in Kampala after choking on a chicken bone. After the raid she was murdered by officers of the Uganda Army, as were some of her doctors and nurses, apparently for trying to intervene. In April 1987, Henry Kyemba, Uganda&#x27;s Attorney general and Minister of Justice at the time, told the Uganda Human Rights Commission that Bloch had been dragged from her hospital bed and killed by two army officers on Amin&#x27;s orders. Bloch was shot and her body was dumped in the trunk of a car that had Ugandan intelligence services number plates. Her remains were recovered near a sugar plantation 20 miles (32 km) east of Kampala in 1979, after the Uganda–Tanzania War ended Amin&#x27;s rule.

==== Idi Amin&#x27;s anti-Kenyan crackdown ====
Amin also ordered the killing of hundreds of Kenyans living in Uganda in retaliation for Kenya&#x27;s assistance to Israel in the raid. Uganda killed 245 Kenyans, including airport staff at Entebbe. To avoid massacre, approximately 3000 Kenyans fled Uganda as refugees.

On 24 May 1978, Kenya&#x27;s former agriculture minister, Bruce MacKenzie, was killed when a bomb attached to his aircraft exploded as MacKenzie departed a meeting with Amin. Some have asserted that Ugandan president Idi Amin ordered Ugandan agents to assassinate MacKenzie in retaliation for Kenya&#x27;s involvement and MacKenzie&#x27;s actions prior to the raid. Others have indicated various other possible causes for the bombing, including that another person aboard the plane may have been the target. Later, Mossad Chief Director Meir Amit had a forest planted in Israel in MacKenzie&#x27;s name.

==Aftermath and reactions==

=== United Nations ===
The United Nations Security Council convened on 9 July 1976, to consider a complaint from the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity charging Israel with an &quot;act of aggression&quot;. The Council allowed Israel&#x27;s ambassador to the United Nations, Chaim Herzog, and Uganda&#x27;s foreign minister, Juma Oris Abdalla, to participate without voting rights. UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim told the Security Council that the raid was &quot;a serious violation of the sovereignty of a Member State of the United Nations&quot; though he was &quot;fully aware that this is not the only element involved ... when the world community is now required to deal with unprecedented problems arising from international terrorism.&quot; Abdalla, the representative of Uganda, alleged that the affair was close to a peaceful resolution when Israel intervened while Herzog, the representative of Israel, accused Uganda of direct complicity in the hijacking. The US and UK sponsored a resolution which condemned hijacking and similar acts, deplored the loss of life arising from the hijacking (without condemning either Israel or Uganda), reaffirmed the need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, and called on the international community to enhance the safety of civil aviation. However, the resolution failed to receive the required number of affirmative votes because two voting members abstained and seven were absent. A second resolution sponsored by Benin, Libya and Tanzania, that condemned Israel, was not put to a vote.

=== Western Bloc ===
Western nations spoke in support of the raid. West Germany called the raid &quot;an act of self-defence&quot;. Switzerland and France praised the operation. Representatives of the United Kingdom and United States offered significant praise, calling the Entebbe raid &quot;an impossible operation&quot;. Some in the United States noted that the hostages were freed on 4 July 1976, 200 years after the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence. In private conversation with Israeli Ambassador Dinitz, Henry Kissinger sounded criticism for Israeli use of US equipment during the operation, but that criticism was not made public at the time. In mid-July 1976, the supercarrier and her escorts entered the Indian Ocean and operated off the Kenyan coast in response to a threat of military action by forces from Uganda.

The hijacked aircraft&#x27;s pilot, Captain Michel Bacos, was awarded the Legion of Honour, and the other crew members were awarded the French Order of Merit.

In the ensuing years, Betser and the Netanyahu brothers – Iddo and Benjamin, all Sayeret Matkal veterans – argued in increasingly public forums about who was to blame for the unexpected early firefight that caused Yonatan&#x27;s death and partial loss of tactical surprise.

As a result of the operation, the United States military developed rescue teams modelled on the unit employed in the Entebbe rescue. One notable attempt was Operation Eagle Claw, a failed 1980 rescue of 53 American embassy personnel held hostage in Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis.

In a letter dated 13 July 1976, the Supreme Commander&#x27;s Staff of the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces praised the Israeli commandos for the mission and extended condolences for &quot;the loss and martyrdom&quot; of Netanyahu.

F-BVGG, the aircraft in the hijacking of Air France Flight 139, was repaired and returned to service with Air France. In April 1996, the aircraft was leased to Vietnam Airlines for three months. In December the same year, the aircraft was converted into a freighter and was delivered to S–C Aviation, having been re-registered as N742SC. In 1998, the aircraft was delivered to MNG Airlines and re-registered as TC-MNA. In 2009, the aircraft was placed into storage at Istanbul Atatürk Airport and was scrapped in 2020.

=== Palestinian bombing of Kenya&#x27;s Norfolk Hotel in Nairobi ===
The Norfolk Hotel in Nairobi, owned by a prominent member of the local Jewish community, was bombed on 31 December 1980. The bomb flattened the hotel, killing 20 people, of several nationalities, and injuring 87 more. It was believed to be an act of revenge by pro-Palestinian militants for Kenya&#x27;s supporting role in Operation Entebbe.

==Commemorations==
In August 2012, Uganda and Israel commemorated the raid at a somber ceremony at the base of the tower at the old terminal, where Yonatan Netanyahu was killed. Uganda and Israel renewed their commitment to &quot;fight terrorism and to work towards humanity&quot;. In addition, wreaths were laid, a moment of silence was held, speeches were given, and a poem was recited. The flags of Uganda and Israel were flown side by side, symbolising the two countries&#x27; strong bilateral relations, next to a plaque bearing a history of the raid. The ceremony was attended by Ugandan State Minister for Animal Industry Bright Rwamirama and the deputy Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel Daniel Ayalon, who laid wreaths at the site. Forty years to the day after the rescue operation, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, brother of slain Israeli commando Yonatan Netanyahu, visited Entebbe with an Israeli delegation, and laid the groundwork for further Israeli–sub-Saharan African bilateral relations.

<text>The International Whaling Commission (IWC) is a specialised regional fishery management organisation, established under the terms of the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) to &quot;provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry&quot;.

As the decision-making body of the convention, the IWC reviews and revises measures laid down in the &quot;Schedule to the Convention&quot;, which govern the conduct of whaling throughout the world. These measures include: confer complete protection of certain species; designate specific areas as whale sanctuaries; set limits on the numbers and size of whales which may be taken; prescribe open and closed seasons and areas for whaling; and prohibit the capture of suckling calves and female whales accompanied by calves. The Commission also mandates the compilation of catch reports and other statistical and biological records, and is actively involved in whale research, including funding and promoting studies, publishing the results of scientific research, and encouraging studies into related matters, such as the humaneness of the killing operations.

Through the &quot;Florianópolis Declaration&quot; of 2018, members of the organization concluded that the purpose of the IWC is the conservation of whales and that they would now safeguard the marine mammals in perpetuity and would allow the recovery of all whale populations to pre-industrial whaling levels. In response, Japan announced on 26 December 2018, that since the IWC failed its duty to promote sustainable hunting, which is one of its stated goals, Japan is withdrawing its membership and will resume commercial hunting in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone from July 2019, but will cease whaling activities in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Structure and membership==
The IWC was created by voluntary agreement among the member states to function as the sole governing body with authority to act under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which is an international environmental agreement signed in 1946 in order to &quot;provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry&quot; and to implement its economic and environmental goals. The role of the commission is to periodically review and revise the &quot;Schedule to the Convention&quot;, controlling the conduct of whaling by setting the protection of certain species; designating areas as whale sanctuaries; setting limits on the numbers and size of catches; prescribing open and closed seasons and areas for whaling; methods and intensity of whaling, types of gear to be used, methods of measurement and maximum catch returns. Under its constitutive document, the IWC is given the task of adopting regulations &quot;to provide for the conservation, development, and optimum utilization of the whale resources&quot; with the condition that such regulations &quot;shall be based on scientific findings.&quot;

The headquarters of the IWC is in Impington, near Cambridge, England. The Secretariat publishes the &quot;Journal of Cetacean Research and Management&quot;, reports, press releases, and a calendar of meetings.
The commission has three main committees—Scientific, Conservation,
and Finance and Administration.
A Technical Committee is established, but has stopped meeting.

Participation in the IWC is not limited to states involved in whaling. Membership in the IWC has doubled since 2001 with an average of almost six states per year joining the IWC from 2002 to 2008. As of February 2024 there were 88 members. Current (2024) members are: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chile, China, Colombia, Republic of the Congo, Costa Rica, Ivory Coast, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark (which also acts as the Kingdom with the Faroe Islands and Greenland), Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Eritrea, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, the Gambia, Germany, Ghana, Grenada, Republic of Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kenya, South Korea, Kiribati, Laos, Liberia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mali, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Morocco, Nauru, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Oman, Palau, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Togo, Tuvalu, United Kingdom, United States, and Uruguay.

Since 2012 the IWC has met in even-numbered years, in September or October.
Meetings are composed of one voting representative (called a Commissioner) from each state party who may be accompanied by experts and advisors. They are generally extremely divisive—demonstrating a complete split on all major issues between the pro-whaling governments and their supporters and the anti-whaling countries. The IWC&#x27;s Rules of Procedure allow non-parties and intergovernmental organisations to attend the meetings and to be represented by observers if they have submitted a written request to the Secretary thirty days before the meeting or if they have attended previous meetings. Non-governmental organisations that maintain offices in more than three countries may also attend the meetings of the IWC.

In 2012, the Commission agreed to move from annual to biennial Commission Meetings. The Scientific Committee continues to meet annually. In years where both meetings are held, a period of at least 100 days separates the two. This is to allow time to read and digest the reports of the Scientific Committee Meeting, before the Commission Meeting begins.

== Annual meetings ==

Members of the International Whaling Commission have met every year since 1949, in addition to having occasional intersessional &#x27;special meetings&#x27; (these are not &#x27;annual meetings&#x27;).

In recent years, the meetings have attracted international media attention due to the growth of the anti-whaling movement.

The IWC also holds occasional &quot;special meetings&quot; (there were five between 1949 and 2007).

From 2012 onwards, it was decided that the annual Commission Meetings would go to biennial Commission Meetings, while the IWC Scientific Committee would still meet annually.

== 1982 moratorium ==
The 1970s saw the beginning of the global anti-whaling movement. In 1972 the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment at Stockholm adopted a proposal that recommended a ten-year moratorium on commercial whaling to allow whale stocks to recover. The reports of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in 1977 and 1981 identified many species of whales as being in danger of extinction.

At the same time, a number of non-whaling and anti-whaling states began to join the IWC and eventually gained a majority over the whaling states. Some countries who were previously major whaling forces, like the United States, became strong proponents of the anti-whaling cause. These countries called for the IWC to reform its policies and to incorporate newly discovered scientific data regarding whales in its proposed regulations.

On 23 July 1982, members of the IWC voted by the necessary three-quarters majority to implement a pause on commercial whaling. The relevant text reads:

The measure passed by 25 votes to seven, with five abstentions.

Japan, Norway, Peru, and the Soviet Union (later replaced by Russia) lodged formal objections, since the moratorium was not based on advice from the Scientific Committee. Japan and Peru later withdrew their objections (Japan&#x27;s withdrawal was precipitated by the US threatening to reduce their fishing quota within US waters if the objection was not withdrawn. However, by 1988 the US had eliminated Japanese fishing quotas anyway. It was after this that the Japanese began scientific whaling.). In 2002, Iceland was allowed to rejoin IWC with a reservation to the moratorium (Iceland withdrew from IWC in 1992), but this reservation is not recognised as a valid objection by many IWC members. In addition, Italy, Mexico, and New Zealand do not consider the ICRW to be in force between their countries and Iceland. None of these countries, however, has mounted any legal challenge to Iceland&#x27;s membership of the IWC.

As the moratorium applies only to commercial whaling, whaling under the scientific-research and aboriginal-subsistence provisions of the ICRW is still allowed. However, environmental groups dispute the claim of research &quot;as a disguise for commercial whaling, which is banned.&quot; Since 1994, Norway has been whaling commercially and Iceland began hunting commercially in September 2006. Since 1986, Japan has been whaling under scientific research permits. The US and several other countries are whaling under aboriginal whaling auspices. Norway lodged a protest to the zero catch limits in 1992 and is not bound by them. Anti-whaling countries and lobbies accuse Japan&#x27;s scientific whaling of being a front for commercial whaling. The Japanese government argues that the refusal of anti-whaling states to accept simple head counts of whale population as a measure of recovery of whale species justifies its continuing studies on sex and age of population distributions, and further points out that IWC regulations specifically require that whale meat obtained by scientific whaling not go to waste. Japan, on the other hand, has raised objections to U.S. aboriginal subsistence whaling, generally seen to be in retaliation to anti-whaling states&#x27; (including the United States&#x27;) objections to aboriginal subsistence whaling for several Japanese fishing communities, which traditionally hunted whales until the imposition of the moratorium.

In May 1994, the IWC also voted to create the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. The vote to adopt the sanctuary resolution was twenty-three in favour, one opposed (Japan) and six abstaining.

===2018 Florianópolis Declaration===

On 13 September 2018, IWC members gathered in Florianópolis, Brazil, where they discussed and rejected a proposal by Japan to renew commercial whaling. Through the &quot;Florianópolis Declaration&quot;, it was concluded that the purpose of the IWC is the conservation of whales and that they would now safeguard the marine mammals in perpetuity and would allow the recovery of all whale populations to pre-industrial whaling levels. It also concluded that the use of lethal research methods is unnecessary. The non-binding agreement was backed by 40 countries, with 27 pro-whaling states voting against. Under this resolution, limited hunts by some indigenous communities are still permitted.

On 26 December 2018, Japan announced that since the IWC failed its duty to promote sustainable hunting, which is one of its stated goals, Japan was withdrawing its membership. Japanese officials also announced they would resume commercial hunting within its territorial waters and its 200-mile exclusive economic zones starting in July 2019, but it would cease whaling activities in the Antarctic Ocean, the northwest Pacific Ocean, and the Australian Whale Sanctuary.

==Enforcement under the IWC==
IWC is a voluntary international organization and is not backed up by treaty, therefore, the IWC has substantial practical limitations on its authority. First, any member countries are free to simply leave the organization and declare themselves not bound by it if they so wish. Second, any member state may opt out of any specific IWC regulation by lodging a formal objection to it within 90 days of the regulation coming into force (such provisions are common in international agreements, on the logic that it is preferable to have parties remain within the agreements than opt out altogether). Third, the IWC has no ability to enforce any of its decisions through penalty imposition.

===International Observer Scheme===
In 1971, Australia and South Africa agreed to supply observers to each other (International Observer Scheme, IOS) to ensure their land-based whaling stations were in compliance of the IWC. A similar agreement was drawn up between Canada, Iceland and Norway covering the North Atlantic area. This was shortly followed by an agreement between Japan and the United States in the North Pacific Ocean. The introduction of the IOS had a positive effect on quality of the reported catch data, according to the Royal Society, despite no significant change in regulations, indicating false reporting may have been prevalent in the Japanese whaling industry prior to the IOS.

==Politics==
There has been concern that the conflict between those who seek renewed utilisation of whales and those who seek protection for every whale has placed a dangerous strain on the IWC. Oran Young and eight other noted scholars in the field assert that &quot;changes in the current [IWC] arrangements are inevitable&quot; and that &quot;the killing of whales for human consumption will continue, whether whalers operate within a reconstructed international whaling regime, opt to join alternative arrangements like NAMMCO, or seek to establish a hybrid system&quot;. The BBC also reports that &quot;[c]onservationists argue that the IWC should be devoting far more of its attention to issues such as whales being hit by ships, the effects of pollution and climate change, and the pressures that drive species such as the baiji (or Yangtse river dolphin) to extinction. As things stand, it cannot. The logjam of hunting has to be overcome first.&quot;

===Allegation of politicising science===

The pro-whaling governments accuse the IWC of basing these decisions upon &quot;political and emotional&quot; factors rather than upon scientific knowledge given that the IWC prohibits all whaling, even though its own Scientific Committee has concluded since 1991 that quotas on some species of whale would be sustainable. They argue the IWC has swayed from its original purpose and is attempting, under the guise of conservation, to essentially grant whales an entitlement to life via an absolute protection from being killed by humans for commercial purposes.

Non-IWC whaling countries have expressed similar sentiments. Canada withdrew from the IWC after the vote to impose the moratorium, claiming that &quot;[t]he ban was inconsistent with measures that had just been adopted by the IWC that were designed to allow harvests of stocks at safe levels.&quot;

After the moratorium came into force in 1986, the Scientific Committee was commissioned to review the status of the whale stocks and develop a calculation method for setting safe catch limits. At the IWC&#x27;s annual meeting in 1991, the Scientific Committee submitted its finding that there existed approximately 761,000 minke whales in Antarctic waters, 87,000 in the northeast Atlantic, and 25,000 in the North Pacific. With such populations, it was submitted, 2000 minke whales could be harvested annually without endangering the population. Despite this, the IWC Plenary Committee voted to maintain the blanket moratorium on whaling, arguing that formulas for determining allowable catches had not yet been adequately evaluated.

In 1991, acting on the recommendation of the Scientific Committee, the IWC adopted a computerized formula, the Revised Management Procedure (RMP), for determining allowable catches of some whale species. Despite the fact that the RMP indicated that it would be possible to authorize a catch that year, the moratorium was not lifted. The IWC noted the need to agree on minimum standards for data, to prepare guidelines on the conduct of population surveys, and to devise and approve a system of measures for monitoring and inspection.

The IWC Plenary committee adopted the RMP in 1994, but decided not to implement it before an inspection and control scheme had been developed. This scheme, together with the RMP, is known as the Revised Management Scheme (RMS). Since then it has been all but impossible for the member countries in the Plenary committee to agree on an RMS.

Australia is the only member country of IWC which has officially announced its opposition to any RMS and is therefore not participating in the discussions. Anti-whaling NGOs, such as Sea Shepherd and Greenpeace, are also generally against the RMS. 

Ray Gambell, then the Secretary of the IWC, agreed at least in part with the argument of the pro-whaling countries: &quot;In all reasonableness, we would have to say that a commercial catch could be taken without endangering [Minke] stocks.&quot; In June 1993 the Chairman of the Scientific Committee, Dr Philip Hammond, resigned in protest to what he saw as contempt of the Scientific Committee&#x27;s recommendations. The same year Norway became the only state in the world to resume commercial whaling, on the grounds that they had objected to, and thus opted out, of the moratorium.

===IWC membership===

The purpose of the IWC as specified in its constitution is &quot;in safeguarding for future generations the great natural resources represented by the whale stocks;&quot; and the original members consisted only of the 15 whale-hunting countries. However, since the late 1970s and early 1980s, many countries which have no previous history of whaling (some of which are landlocked such as Switzerland and Mongolia) have joined the IWC. This shift was first initiated by Sir Peter Scott, the then head of the World Wildlife Fund. Labelling the IWC a &quot;butchers&#x27; club&quot;, he mounted lobbying campaigns in developed countries with support from the green lobby and anti-whaling block of IWC members to change the composition of the IWC&#x27;s membership, which was instrumental in obtaining the necessary three-quarters majority vote to implement the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. This campaign triggered the first accusations of vote-buying in IWC. According to Scott&#x27;s biographer, Elspeth Huxley, China&#x27;s decision to join was influenced by a World Wildlife Fund promise to provide $1 million to fund a panda reserve. Michael Tillman, former IWC Commissioner of the United States, said in a radio interview that &quot;there was what we called &#x27;common knowledge,&#x27; that a number of countries joined and that their dues and the travel support was reportedly due to conservation groups providing it. So that, in a sense, one could say that the conservation groups set out a strategy that the Japanese copied.&quot;

Since the moratorium was adopted, the support for it has dropped from a 75% majority to a 50–50 split, with many of the countries initially recruited by the anti-whaling side now voting with the pro-whaling block. (A 75% majority is needed to overturn the moratorium.) Anti-whaling campaign groups and some governments claim that the Japanese Fisheries Agency has carried out a programme of &quot;vote-buying&quot;—i.e. offering aid to poorer countries in return for them joining the IWC and supporting Japanese positions on whaling. Japan claims, however, that this accusation itself is politically motivated because Japan&#x27;s overseas aid is not only given to pro-whaling countries. Japan has given US$320 million in overseas aid to Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Guinea, Morocco, Panama, St. Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St Kitts and Nevis and the Solomon Islands. Caribbean countries have consistently sided with Japan in each IWC vote since 2001 though the Caribbean governments admit the rules may possibly impact on their fishing activities as well. Pacific countries&#x27; voting patterns vary even for each motion, as they are lobbied by neighbouring pro-whaling Japan and anti-whaling New Zealand and Australia. Greenpeace alleges that Japan&#x27;s aid activities and these countries&#x27; voting patterns are correlated. These allegations of tying aid to votes are based on public admissions by government officials both inside and outside Japan, as well as an analysis of voting patterns compared to Japanese Fisheries Aid received.
In 2005, The Environmental Investigation Agency approached Lord Ashcroft of the UK to use his influence in Belize to assure support for the anti-whaling camp. It was reported that Ashcroft paid Belize&#x27;s IWC subscription fees:

Both sides accuse each other of using underhanded tactics to pack the commission with countries sympathetic to their position. Edwin Snagg, the IWC commissioner for St Vincent and the Grenadines stated, &quot;It&#x27;s a question of respect...Because you are small and because you are underdeveloped there is this view and there is this feeling that you can easily be bought and you can easily be sold. We in the Caribbean feel highly offended.&quot; Moreover, there are no developing countries who support an anti-whaling stance. The BBC reported that &quot;Some countries recently admitted to the European Union have been advised by a &quot;word in the ear&quot; that it would be &quot;a good idea&quot; for them to join the IWC. Some activists believe that Britain and its fellow EU old-timers such as France and Germany should recruit all member states into the commission.&quot; In Australia, National Nine News reported that &quot;New Zealand is questioning pro-whaling support among Pacific Island states with the opposition calling for a rethink of foreign aid.&quot; It is expected that more countries in the future will join the IWC including some landlocked countries. Currently, there are nine landlocked IWC members. Mali and Mongolia voted with other pro-whaling countries. Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Switzerland and San Marino voted with other anti-whaling countries.

Both pro- and anti-whaling countries claim that their recruiting activities are restricted to lobbying and persuasion based on the merits of their cause. Anti-whaling campaigners argue that scientific studies are not currently clear enough to warrant resumption of commercial whaling. Moreover, there are various other issues such as welfare of whales which is beyond the simple matter of conservation. (See The arguments for and against whaling) These issues have global relevance which is not restricted only to whaling and whaling countries. Moreover, public opinion in many anti-whaling countries is solidly behind the governmental position on whaling within the IWC. Pro-whaling countries, on the other hand, argue that the public&#x27;s anti-whaling stance is often based on misinformation – a 2003 article in &quot;The Economist&quot; noted that surveys in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States had found that a majority of respondents incorrectly believe that all whale species are endangered.

Moreover, coastal countries have a vested interest in conserving their fish stocks which may be threatened by whales (this claim is strongly contested by the anti-whaling lobby). Japan, particularly when lobbying African governments, argues that diversification of the anti-whaling argument outside of conservation is a threat to their national interest. Exploitation of wildlife resources (such as elephant ivory, sea turtles or primates) is restricted supposedly on the ground of sustainable management. Alleged filibustering of the Revised Management Scheme and diversification of arguments outside of conservation by the anti-whaling side are claimed to be signs that anti-whaling countries no longer adhere to this principle (of sustainable management and exploitation of natural resources). The Japanese argue that the African countries and whaling countries have a shared interest in preventing the principle of sustainable management being exploited as a cover for animal rights arguments:
At the London IWC meeting in 2001 Sandra Lee-Vercoe, the New Zealand delegate to the commission, accused Japan of buying votes. The Japanese delegate denied the allegations:

Komatsu also said that Caribbean countries naturally supported pro-whaling resolutions as they are whaling countries themselves (mostly of smaller cetaceans) and that the New Zealand commissioner was inventing &quot;fairy stories&quot;.

Anti-whaling groups cite several statements in response to this rebuttal. In an interview reported in &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper in May 2001, Atherton Martin, Dominica&#x27;s former Environment and Fisheries Minister who publicly opposes whaling, said:

Greenpeace also quotes Tongan parliamentarian Samiu K Vaipulu as saying at a workshop on the proposed South Pacific Whale Sanctuary in Samoa that Japan had linked whale votes to aid. Lester Bird, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, had said:

In an interview with Australian ABC television in July 2001, Japanese Fisheries Agency official Maseyuku Komatsu described minke whales as &quot;cockroaches of the sea&quot;. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that he further stated &quot;lacking military might, his country had to use the tools of diplomacy and promises of development aid to &quot;get appreciation of Japan&#x27;s position&quot; on whaling. Billions of yen have flowed to countries that joined the IWC from both pro- and anti-whaling countries. &quot;It already brings back the time when we were colonised,&quot; says Clarice Charles, of Grenada. &quot;Would these rich nations give a poor fisherman a revolving loan or a grant or a gift so that he can buy [a tourist boat] to go whale watching?&quot;

In Japan, conservative media outlets (the most vocal ones being &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; and &quot;Bungei Shunju&quot;) argue that countries which oppose commercial whaling altogether should not be in the IWC at all and that the anti-whaling side has subverted the purpose of the IWC by exploiting the (lack of) membership requirements. Moreover, they point out that the anti-whaling lobby within the IWC is also led by wealthy developed countries and is equally susceptible to accusations of vote-buying and influence-peddling. They accuse the anti-whaling side within the IWC of using conservation as a cover for its ideological opposition to whaling itself, which mirrors the accusation from the anti-whaling side that Japan&#x27;s scientific whaling is a cover for commercial whaling. Since 2000, 29 new countries have joined the IWC, 18 of them pro-whaling, 11 anti. Japan notes that major anti-whaling countries such as the U.S., Australia, UK and New Zealand also donate aid to poor countries on the IWC and wield far more influence than Japan alone and thus they could easily be accused of the same tactics.

Japan is pushing to have secret ballot voting introduced at IWC meetings. Secret ballot voting would weaken accusations of Japanese vote-buying by making it impossible to monitor so-called client members&#x27; votes. From Japan&#x27;s point of view, secret ballot voting would also reduce the powerful collective influence of the anti-whaling lobby on IWC members. One of the new 2006 members, Israel, which had been asked specifically to join by the US, voted consistently with the anti-whaling bloc. Belize, a country previously accused of having its vote bought and paid for by Japan by a number of countries and NGOs, shifted sides and consistently voted with the anti-whaling block at the 2006 IWC meeting. Anti-whaling governments oppose secret ballot voting on the grounds that it is without precedent in other international bodies and that it would remove accountability and make behind-the-scenes deals between delegations more likely. However, St Kitts and Nevis Commissioner, Cedric Liburd, argued during a debate on the secret ballot vote at the 2006 meeting that it was hypocritical of anti-whaling countries to pontificate on the need for transparency within the IWC by open voting when the same countries happily voted via secret ballot in CITES, a similar management body.

===The role of the United States===
The effectiveness of IWC decisions (at least on smaller whaling states) may be explained in large part by the fact that the United States has been willing to act unilaterally in support of them. The pro-whaling countries often see the U.S.&#x27;s propensity to act outside the IWC framework as &quot;bullying&quot; tactics, while environmentalists and the conservation lobby tend to applaud the U.S.&#x27;s approach.

The United States first incorporated the IWC&#x27;s régime into domestic law in the 1971 Pelly Amendment to the Fisherman&#x27;s Protective Act of 1967. This amendment provides that when the Secretary of Commerce determines that the nationals of a foreign country are diminishing the effectiveness of an international fishery conservation program (including the IWC&#x27;s program), the Secretary shall certify this fact to the President. The President then has the discretion to ban importation of fishing products from the offending country. The United States has threatened sanctions under the Pelly Amendment on a number of occasions. In November 1974, pressure from the United States contributed to Japan and the Soviet Union complying with the 1974–1975 quotas. Similarly, in December 1978, Chile, South Korea and Peru acceded to the IWC after the United States certified them under the Amendment. The threatened certification of Spain also led that country to observe a fin whale quota to which it had objected.

These measures were further strengthened by the 1979 Packwood-Magnuson Amendment to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976. It provides that, when the Secretary of Commerce certifies that a country is diminishing the effectiveness of the work of the IWC, the Secretary of State must reduce that country&#x27;s fishing allocation in U.S. waters by at least 50%. Certification under the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment also serves as certification under the Pelly Amendment. The threatened application in 1980 of the Packwood-Magnuson and Pelly Amendments led South Korea to agree to follow IWC guidelines restricting the use of cold (i.e. non-explosive) harpoons. Faced with similar pressure, the Republic of China (Taiwan) placed a complete ban on whaling in 1981. Without United States support, it is possible that the 1986 moratorium would have been substantially limited, as countries such as Iceland, Japan, Norway and the Soviet Union would have opted out and continued commercial whaling.

===The North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission===

The moratorium on commercial whaling led Iceland to withdraw in protest from the IWC, as it had threatened to do if the moratorium was extended. Japan and Norway also threatened to leave the organisation. In April 1992, the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) was established by the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, and Norway under the Agreement on Cooperation in Research, Conservation and Management of Marine Mammals in the North Atlantic. The document clearly responded to what the drafters regarded as the inappropriate whale protectionist tendencies of the IWC. Guðmundur Eiríksson of Iceland stated at NAMMCO&#x27;s inaugural meeting that the organisation was established in part out of dissatisfaction with the IWC&#x27;s zero-catch quota. Although NAMMCO does not conflict directly with the obligations of membership states under the IWC, it nonetheless presented a challenge to the legitimacy of the IWC.

<text>Frans van Schooten Jr. also rendered as Franciscus van Schooten (15 May 1615 – 29 May 1660) was a Dutch mathematician who is most known for popularizing the analytic geometry of René Descartes.

==Life==
Van Schooten&#x27;s father, was a professor of mathematics at the University of Leiden, having Christiaan Huygens, Johann van Waveren Hudde, and René de Sluze as students.

Van Schooten met Descartes in 1632 and read his &quot;Géométrie&quot; (an appendix to his &quot;Discours de la méthode&quot;) while it was still unpublished. Finding it hard to understand, he went to France to study the works of other important mathematicians of his time, such as François Viète and Pierre de Fermat. Frans van Schooten returned home to Leiden in 1643 to assist his father and, two years later, inherited his father&#x27;s position as professor at Leiden&#x27;s Engineering School. One of his most important pupils at this time was Huygens.

The pendant marriage portraits of him and his wife Margrieta Wijnants were painted by Rembrandt and are kept in the National Gallery of Art:
==Work==

Van Schooten&#x27;s 1649 Latin translation of and commentary on Descartes&#x27; &quot;Géométrie&quot; was valuable in that it made the work comprehensible to the broader mathematical community, and thus was responsible for the spread of analytic geometry to the world.

Over the next decade he enlisted the aid of other mathematicians of the time, de Beaune, Hudde, Heuraet, de Witt and expanded the commentaries to two volumes, published in 1659 and 1661. This edition and its extensive commentaries was far more influential than the 1649 edition. It was this edition that Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton knew.

Van Schooten was one of the first to suggest, in exercises published in 1657, that these ideas be extended to three-dimensional space. Van Schooten&#x27;s efforts also made Leiden the centre of the mathematical community for a short period in the middle of the seventeenth century.

In elementary geometry Van Schooten&#x27;s theorem is named after him.

<text>Gudrun Ensslin (; 15 August 1940 – 18 October 1977) was a German far-left terrorist and founder of the West German far-left militant group Red Army Faction (, or RAF, also known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang).

After becoming involved with co-founder Andreas Baader, Ensslin was influential in the development of his political beliefs. Ensslin was perhaps the intellectual head of the RAF. She was involved in five bomb attacks, with four deaths, was arrested in 1972 and died on 18 October 1977 in what has been called Stammheim Prison&#x27;s &quot;Death Night&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Ensslin was the fourth of seven children, and grew up in Bad Cannstatt, Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart, Germany, where her father Helmut Ensslin (de) was a pastor of the Evangelical Church.

Ensslin was a well-behaved child who did well at school and enjoyed working with the Protestant Girl Scouts, and doing parish work such as organizing Bible studies. In her family, the social injustices of the world were often discussed, and she is said to have been sensitized to social problems in West Germany and the world as a whole.

At the age of eighteen, Ensslin spent a year in the United States, where she attended high school in Warren, Pennsylvania. She graduated in the honors group at the high school in 1959. After returning home, she finished the remaining requirements for her secondary education.

Like her partner Bernward Vesper (de) and other members of the Red Army Faction, including Ulrike Meinhof and Horst Mahler, Ensslin had excellent exam scores and received a scholarship from the German National Academic Foundation. Studying at the University of Tübingen, she read education, English studies, and German studies. Ensslin also met Vesper in February 1962.

In Tübingen, together with two other students, Ensslin and Vesper organized a student workshop for new literature which led to a shoestring publishing business called &quot;Studio neue Literatur&quot;. The first book produced was an anthology of poems against atomic weapons, with prominent poets from all German-speaking countries as well as a bilingual edition of poems by Gerardo Diego.

In 1963 and 1964, Ensslin earned her elementary school teacher&#x27;s diploma. In the summer of 1964, the couple moved to West Berlin where Ensslin began her thesis on Hans Henny Jahnn.

==Career==
In 1965, Gudrun&#x27;s younger sister Johanna married Günter Maschke, then a revolutionary Marxist poet and member of the Situationist International group Subversive Aktion, which included Rudi Dutschke as a member. Maschke became later in life a leading conservative antidemocratic intellectual and commentator of the work of Carl Schmitt. Later that year, Gudrun and Bernward were engaged to be married. Both were active in the democratic left-wing, they had well-paid jobs working for the Social Democratic Party of Germany. The couple demonstrated together against new security laws, the Vietnam War, an Allied Powers arms show, and for the right to demonstrate. Vesper neglected his studies, read voraciously, and in 1966 published, with a group of friends, a serious and important series of pamphlets and paperbacks, the &quot;Voltaire Flugschriften&quot;. In May 1967, Ensslin gave birth to their son Felix Ensslin.

In July or August 1967, Ensslin met Andreas Baader and they soon began a love affair. Baader had come to Berlin in 1963, to escape ongoing troubles with the Munich justice system and also to avoid conscription. Baader, who drifted in and out of youth detention centers and prison soon became the man of Ensslin&#x27;s life. In February 1968, Ensslin broke up with Vesper by phone, informing him that the relationship was already finished before Felix was born. An artifact from this time is an experimental film Ensslin participated in entitled &quot;Das Abonnement&quot; (&quot;The Subscription&quot;).

===Red Army Faction leader===

In June 1967, Ensslin participated in political protests against the Shah of Iran during his visit to Germany. Though Western governments viewed the Shah as a reformer, his regime was also being criticized for oppression, brutality, corruption, and extravagance. In what started as a peaceful but unauthorised demonstration at Deutsche Oper Berlin, fights broke out between pro-Shah and anti-Shah demonstrators and an unarmed protestor named Benno Ohnesorg was fatally shot in the back of the head by a police officer, Karl-Heinz Kurras. On the night following Ohnesorg&#x27;s death, Ensslin angrily denounced West Germany as a fascist police state at a Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund meeting. Also, West Berlin&#x27;s own urban guerrilla organization, Movement 2 June, named itself after this event.

Kurras was charged with manslaughter and acquitted on grounds of self-defense on 23 November 1967, which caused further public outrage. Matters eventually cooled, which enraged Baader and Ensslin. She had left Vesper and her child for good early in 1968 and now she, Baader and Thorwald Proll decided to escalate their fight against the system. They left West Berlin around 20 March, and in Munich decided to firebomb department stores in Frankfurt, where a Socialist German Student Union congress was taking place. Together with Horst Söhnlein, they left for Frankfurt on 1 April.

The night of 2 April 1968, a department store in Frankfurt was set ablaze, for which Baader, Ensslin, Proll and Söhnlein were subsequently arrested and prosecuted. In October 1968 they were sentenced to three years in prison for arson. After being released pending an appeal in June 1969, Baader, Ensslin and Proll fled Italy via France when the appeal was denied.

Baader was arrested on 4 April 1970 in Berlin. Ensslin, Meinhof, who was at that time a well-known leftist journalist, and two other women freed him on 14 May 1970. One person was wounded. This was the beginning of the gang&#x27;s violent actions, and the Red Army Faction. Ensslin became one of the most wanted people in Germany.

In May 1971, Vesper committed suicide in a mental hospital and Felix was sent to live with foster parents.

Ensslin was arrested in a boutique on 7 June 1972 in Hamburg.

==Death==

The Red Army Faction&#x27;s second generation made several attempts to free Ensslin and her comrades from prison. One attempt involved the kidnapping of Hanns-Martin Schleyer on 5 September 1977, and a proposed prisoner exchange. When this failed to work, the RAF orchestrated the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181 on 17 October. After the airplane was stormed by a German anti-terrorist unit, Schleyer was killed and put inside the trunk of a car in France.

Hours after the storming, in a night that became known as &quot;Death Night of Stammheim&quot;, Ensslin, Baader, and Jan-Carl Raspe were found dead in the high security block of Stammheim Prison in Stuttgart. Like Meinhof, Ensslin was found dead by hanging in her cell. Baader and Raspe were found shot. A fourth member, Irmgard Möller, allegedly stabbed herself four times in the chest with a stolen knife. She recovered from her wounds and has since stated that the deaths were not suicides but extrajudicial killings undertaken by the government of the time, a claim strongly denied by the governments former and present. One exhaustive study of the RAF by Stefan Aust (revised in 2009 as &quot;Baader-Meinhof: the inside story of the RAF&quot;) ultimately accepts the state&#x27;s official ruling that the deaths were suicides, while highlighting serious shortcomings in the investigations.

On 27 October 1977, Ensslin was buried in a common grave with Baader and Raspe in the Dornhalden Cemetery in Stuttgart.

== In film ==
In 1981, Margarethe von Trotta&#x27;s feature film &quot;Marianne and Juliane&quot; presented a fictionalised portrayal of an incarcerated Ensslin (Barbara Sukowa) and her sister (Jutta Lampe).

In 1986, Sabine Wegner played Ensslin in Reinhard Hauff&#x27;s &quot;Stammheim&quot;, a detailed account of the trial against Ensslin, Baader, Meinhof and others.

Also in 1986, Corinna Kirchhoff played Ensslin in Markus Imhoof&#x27;s &quot;The Journey&quot; (&quot;Die Reise&quot;), based on the memoirs of Ensslin&#x27;s companion Bernward Vesper.

In 1997, Anya Hoffmann was Ensslin in Heinrich Breloer&#x27;s award-winning TV docudrama &quot;Death Game&quot;.

In 2008, Ensslin was portrayed by Johanna Wokalek in Uli Edel&#x27;s &quot;The Baader Meinhof Complex&quot;, an adaptation of the non-fiction book of the same name by Stefan Aust. Wokalek&#x27;s performance in the film was rewarded with a nomination for the German Film Award 2009 and a Bambi award as best German actress. The film was chosen as Germany&#x27;s submission to the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, and was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film for the 66th Golden Globe Awards.

In February 2011, Andres Veiel&#x27;s feature film &quot;If Not Us, Who?&quot;, in which Lena Lauzemis plays Gudrun Ensslin, won the Alfred Bauer Prize and the Prize of the German Art House Cinemas at the Berlin International Film Festival.

== In theatre ==
Ensslin appears as a character in Elfriede Jelinek&#x27;s play &quot;Ulrike Maria Stuart&quot;.

Her writings feature in German avant-garde composer Helmut Lachenmann&#x27;s opera &quot;Das Mädchen mit den Schwefelhölzern&quot;.

<doc id="66867" wikidata="Q701181" url="?curid=66867" title="2 June Movement">
<text>The 2 June Movement () was a West German anarchist militant group based in West Berlin. Active from January 1972 to 1980, the anarchist group was one of the few militant groups at the time in Germany. Although the 2 June Movement did not share the same ideology as the Red Army Faction (Baader-Meinhof Gang), these organizations were allies. The 2 June Movement did not establish as much influence in Germany as their Marxist counterparts, and is best known for kidnapping West Berlin mayoral candidate Peter Lorenz.

Rising from the ashes of political group Kommune 1 and militant group Tupamaros West-Berlin, the 2 June Movement was formed in July 1971. During the trial of Thomas Weissbecker, Michael Baumann, and Georg von Rauch for an assault on , Baumann and Weissbecker were ordered to be released on bail. When the release was announced, Rauch, who was facing a probable ten-year sentence for other charges, pretended to be Weissbecker, and left the courtroom with Baumann. The two immediately went underground. Once Weissbecker revealed his identity, he was released from custody. Following their escape, the 2 June Movement was formed.

In contrast to the Red Army Faction (RAF), the 2 June Movement was anarchist rather than Marxist. The organization derived its name from the date that German university student Benno Ohnesorg was shot by West Berlin Police officer Karl-Heinz Kurras while participating in a protest against the Shah of Iran Mohammed Reza Pahlavi&#x27;s state visit to Germany, as the demonstrators were attacked by the police. His death ignited the left-wing movement in West Germany, influencing politicians and political activists, and leading to the establishment of violent non-state actors. Although the organization never became as notorious as the RAF, the 2 June Movement was the most prominent in the first phase of German leftist post-World War II militarism.
==Fritz Teufel ==
Political activist Fritz Teufel became one of the leaders of the 2 June Movement. Originally taking part in Kommune 1, his comical take on revolutionary activity had him dubbed &quot;fun guerilla&quot; by himself and the general public. In 1967, Teufel became a quasi-icon in West Germany after being arrested. Charged with treason and the attempted assassination of United States Vice President Hubert Humphrey, Teufel was eventually acquitted. His humorous image was constructed following his arrest, as he and his associates were brought into questioning with a flour-pudding-yogurt concoction that was to be used as a &quot;bomb&quot;. On 2 June 1967, Teufel was arrested again, this time falsely accused of throwing a rock at police and provoking the riot at which Benno Ohnesorg was killed. This time, he served six months in jail.

In 1975, Teufel was arrested and charged with kidnapping Peter Lorenz, spending five years in pre-trial detention. When he came to trial, he was able to prove he was working in a toilet seat factory at the time, yet was still convicted of various charges and given a sentence of five years, which he had already served.

Although the 2 June Movement never developed a clear ideology or purpose for its existence, Teufel&#x27;s political activism was rooted in his hatred for his parents&#x27; generation. Just like many students and activists of his age, Teufel was angered by the Nazi regime of the previous generation, and fought to eliminate that image from Germany. Much of the resentment was directed towards those who had played a role in the Nazi regime, especially those who had never taken any responsibility for their actions.

==Bombings, kidnappings, and other violent acts==
Aside from the kidnapping of Peter Lorenz, the group is known for many other attacks. The 2 June Movement predominantly used firearms when carrying out their attacks, but also used explosive devices.

On 4 December 1971 during a massive search throughout the city of West Berlin following the discovery of a Red Army Faction safe house, three members of the 2 June Movement got into a shootout with a plainclothes policeman. George von Rauch was killed, while Michael Baumann and another guerrilla managed to escape. Before this confrontation they had carried out an assault on Technische Universität Berlin a month prior.

On 2 February 1972, the 2 June Movement declared responsibility for a bombing at the British Yacht Club in West Berlin. The attack, which killed the boat&#x27;s engineer, was later found out to be an act of assistance for the Irish Republican Army. During the trial, which took place in February 1974, 2 June Movement and other militants started a riot at the court&#x27;s exterior.

On 2 March 1972 Thomas Weisbecker was killed in Augsburg, Germany during a shootout with two Munich policeman.

On the fifth anniversary of Benno Ohnesorg&#x27;s death, a bomb exploded in West Berlin. To this day, no group has taken responsibility for the bombing, although it was inferred that attack was the action of 2 June Movement.

In West Berlin on 27 July 1973, the 2 June Movement stole 200,000 Deutsch Marks from a local bank.

In mid-1974, 2 June Movement member Ulrich Schmücker was shot to death by others in the organization. Although it is not clear what the rationale was for the shooting, Schmücker was believed to be an informant. The opposing argument was that the murder was an accident.

After Red Army Faction member Holger Meins died of starvation in prison, the 2 June Movement attempted a kidnapping of Superior Court Justice Günter von Drenkmann, who was killed in the process.

==Arrests and escapes==
Throughout the course of the organization&#x27;s history, several notable arrests resulted in the imprisonment of 2 June Movement members.
Associate Till Meyer was taken into custody after a 29 March 1972 shooting in Bielefeld at which no one was wounded. By December, he was convicted of the attempted murder of a policeman, and imprisoned for three years.

On 19 April 1972 four hundred police raid the Georg von Rauch Haus. Evidence related to recent bombings were discovered, but members of the 2 June Movement who had been living there were elsewhere at the time of the raid. Twenty-seven people were taken in for questioning.

Later that June, Bernhard Braun was discovered and arrested for his activity in violent attacks, along with Red Army Faction member Brigitte Mohnhaupt.

In 1973, 2 June Movement member Gabi Kröcher-Tiedemann was arrested after shooting a policeman and sentenced to eight years in prison. She was set free in 1975 as a part of the bargain in the Peter Lorenz kidnapping.
Within a few months of each other in late 1973, Inge Viett and Till Meyer escaped from prison.

==Kidnapping of Peter Lorenz==
Three days before mayoral election in West Berlin in 1975, candidate Peter Lorenz of the Christian Democratic Union party was kidnapped by 2 June Movement members. Lorenz was cornered while on the road, and was thrown into another vehicle after his driver was knocked unconscious from the vehicle collision involving the kidnappers. In an effort to free several imprisoned Red Army Faction and 2 June Movement affiliates, the extremists publicized a photo which showed Lorenz with a sign around his neck that read &quot;Peter Lorenz, prisoner of the 2nd June Movement&quot;. The photo also contained a message that demanded the release of Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann, Horst Mahler, Ingrid Siepmann, Rolf Heissler, Rolf Pohle, and Verena Becker from prison. Along with the release of these members, 2 June Movement also demanded that a jet be provided to fly the radicals out to Aden located in South Yemen, and 9,000 German marks should be given to the 2 June Movement. The West German government met their demands, releasing all but Horst Mahler, who did not want to be set free. On 5 March 1975 Peter Lorenz was released at midnight, six hours after the West German Government had fulfilled the demands made by his abductors. He was dropped off in Wilmersdorf district, walked to a telephone booth, and called his wife, Marianne, to tell her that their six-day ordeal was over.

==Dissolution==
On 2 June 1980, the 2 June Movement declared that they had disbanded and merged with the Red Army Faction in a letter to the German daily newspaper, Frankfurter Rundschau. Anti-imperialism was a common cause that brought the 2 June Movement to join forces with the Red Army Faction. The 2 June movement ended their statement with &quot;Unity in the Anti-Imperialist Armed Struggle&quot; conveying their solidarity with the Red Army Faction.

<doc id="66870" wikidata="Q233464" url="?curid=66870" title="Annie Hall">
<text>Annie Hall is a 1977 American satirical romantic comedy-drama film directed by Woody Allen from a screenplay written by Allen and Marshall Brickman, and produced by Allen&#x27;s manager, Charles H. Joffe. The film stars Allen as Alvy Singer, who tries to figure out the reasons for the failure of his relationship with the eponymous female lead, played by Diane Keaton in a role written specifically for her.

Principal photography for the film began on May 19, 1976, on the South Fork of Long Island, and continued periodically for the next ten months. Allen has described the result, which marked his first collaboration with cinematographer Gordon Willis, as &quot;a major turning point&quot;, in that, unlike the farces and comedies that were his work to that point, it introduced a new level of seriousness. Academics have noted the contrast in the settings of New York City and Los Angeles, the stereotype of gender differences in sexuality, the presentation of Jewish identity, and the elements of psychoanalysis and modernism.

&quot;Annie Hall&quot; was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival on March 27, 1977, before its official release in the United States on April 20, 1977. The film received widespread critical acclaim, and was nominated for the Big Five Academy Awards, winning four: the Academy Award for Best Picture, two for Allen (Best Director and, with Brickman, Best Original Screenplay), and Best Actress for Keaton. The film additionally won four BAFTA Awards, including Best Film, Best Direction (for Allen), Best Screenplay (for both Allen and Brickman) and Best Actress in a Leading Role (for Keaton), in addition to the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical (for Keaton). The film&#x27;s box office receipts in the United States and Canada of $38,251,425 are fourth-best of Allen&#x27;s works when not adjusted for inflation.

Regarded among the greatest films ever made, it ranks 31st on AFI&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest films in American cinema, 4th on their list of the greatest comedy films and 28th on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert called it &quot;just about everyone&#x27;s favorite Woody Allen movie&quot;. The film&#x27;s screenplay was also named the funniest ever written by the Writers Guild of America in its list of the &quot;101 Funniest Screenplays&quot;. In 1992, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. It is also regarded by critics as a landmark &quot;transitional&quot; film in Allen&#x27;s career, moving his work from more &quot;accessible&quot; and surreal parody towards more &quot;naturalistic&quot; comic filmmaking.

==Plot==
Comedian Alvy Singer is trying to understand why his relationship with Annie Hall ended a year earlier. Growing up in Brooklyn, he vexed his mother with impossible questions about the emptiness of existence, and was precocious about his innocent sexual curiosity, suddenly kissing a classmate at six years old and not understanding why she was not keen to reciprocate.

Annie and Alvy, waiting in a movie theater line to see &quot;The Sorrow and the Pity&quot;, overhear another man deriding the work of Federico Fellini and referencing Marshall McLuhan. Alvy imagines McLuhan himself stepping in at his invitation to criticize the man&#x27;s comprehension of his work. That night, Annie shows no interest in sex with Alvy. Instead, they discuss his first wife, whom he devalued because of her interest in him. His second marriage was to a New York writer who did not share his enthusiasm for sports and was unable to reach orgasm.

With Annie, it is different. The two of them have fun cooking a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. They had met playing tennis doubles with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk leads her to offer him a ride uptown, and then a glass of wine on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild exchange of trivial personal data is revealed in &quot;mental subtitles&quot; as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annie&#x27;s singing audition for a nightclub (&quot;It Had to Be You&quot;). After having sex that night, Alvy is &quot;a wreck&quot;, while Annie relaxes with a joint.

Soon, Annie admits she loves Alvy, while he buys her books on death and says that his feelings for her are more than just love. When Annie moves in with him, things become very tense. Eventually, Alvy finds her arm-in-arm with one of her adult-education professors, and the two begin to argue about whether this is the &quot;flexibility&quot; they had discussed. They eventually break up, and he searches for the truth of relationships, asking strangers on the street about the nature of love, questioning his formative years, and imagining a cartoon version of himself arguing with a cartoon Annie portrayed as the Evil Queen in &quot;Snow White&quot;.

Alvy attempts a return to dating, but the effort is marred by neurosis and an underwhelming sexual encounter that is interrupted when Annie calls in the middle of the night, urging him to come over immediately to kill a spider in her bathroom. A reconciliation follows, coupled with a vow to stay together, come what may. However, their separate discussions with their therapists make it evident there is an unspoken and unbridgeable divide. When Alvy accepts an offer to present an award on television, they travel to Los Angeles with Alvy&#x27;s friend Rob. However, on the return trip, they agree that their relationship is not working. After losing Annie to her record producer Tony Lacey, Alvy unsuccessfully tries to rekindle the flame with a marriage proposal. Back in New York, he stages a play of their relationship, but he changes the ending: now she accepts.

The last meeting between Annie and Alvy takes place on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side after they have both moved on to someone new. Alvy&#x27;s voice returns with the summation that though relationships are irrational, crazy, and absurd, we just need to have them. Annie sings &quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot;.

Truman Capote has a cameo in the film. Alvy is making quips about people walking by. He says, &quot;There&#x27;s the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest&quot; as Capote walks through the frame. Several actors who later gained a higher profile had small parts in the film: John Glover as Annie&#x27;s actor boyfriend, Jerry; Jeff Goldblum as a man who &quot;forgot [his] mantra&quot; at Tony Lacey&#x27;s Christmas party; Beverly D&#x27;Angelo as an actress in Rob&#x27;s TV show; Christopher Walken as Annie&#x27;s brother, Duane; and Sigourney Weaver, in her film debut, in the closing sequence as Alvy&#x27;s date at the movie theater. Laurie Bird also appears, two years before her suicide.

==Style and technique==
Technically, the film marked an advance for the director. He selected Gordon Willis as his cinematographer—for Allen &quot;a very important teacher&quot; and a &quot;technical wizard,&quot; saying, &quot;I really count &quot;Annie Hall&quot; as the first step toward maturity in some way in making films.&quot; At the time, it was considered an &quot;odd pairing&quot; by many, Keaton among them. The director was known for his comedies and farces, while Willis was known as &quot;the prince of darkness&quot; for work on dramatic films like &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Despite this, the two became friends during filming and continued the collaboration on several later films, including &quot;Zelig&quot;, which earned Willis his first Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography.

Willis described the production for the film as &quot;relatively easy.&quot; He shot in varying styles; &quot;hot golden light for California, grey overcast for Manhattan and a forties Hollywood glossy for ... dream sequences,&quot; most of which were cut. It was his suggestion which led Allen to film the dual therapy scenes in one set divided by a wall instead of the usual split screen method. He tried long takes, with some shots, unabridged, lasting an entire scene, which, for Ebert, add to the dramatic power of the film: &quot;Few viewers probably notice how much of &quot;Annie Hall&quot; consists of people talking, simply talking. They walk and talk, sit and talk, go to shrinks, go to lunch, make love and talk, talk to the camera, or launch into inspired monologues like Annie&#x27;s free-association as she describes her family to Alvy. This speech by Diane Keaton is as close to perfect as such a speech can likely be ... all done in one take of brilliant brinksmanship.&quot; He cites a study that calculated the average shot length of &quot;Annie Hall&quot; to be 14.5 seconds, while other films made in 1977 had an average shot length of 4–7 seconds. Peter Cowie suggests that &quot;Allen breaks up his extended shots with more orthodox cutting back and forth in conversation pieces so that the forward momentum of the film is sustained.&quot; Bernd Herzogenrath notes the innovation in the use of the split-screen during the dinner scene to powerfully exaggerate the contrast between the Jewish and the gentile family.

Although the film is not essentially experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen&#x27;s way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one scene, Allen&#x27;s character, in line to see a movie with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini&#x27;s and Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off-camera to correct the man&#x27;s errors personally. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, &quot;mental subtitles&quot; convey to the audience the characters&#x27; nervous inner doubts. An animated scene—with artwork based on the comic strip &quot;Inside Woody Allen&quot;—depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from &quot;Snow White&quot;. Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the &quot;fourth wall&quot; is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another, he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable &quot;wish-fulfillment.&quot; Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, &quot;because I felt many of the people in the audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them.&quot;

==Production==

===Writing===
The idea for what became &quot;Annie Hall&quot; was developed as Allen walked around New York City with co-writer Marshall Brickman. The pair discussed the project frequently, sometimes becoming frustrated and rejecting the idea. Allen wrote a first draft of a screenplay within a four-day period, sending it to Brickman to make alterations. According to Brickman, this draft centered on a man in his forties, someone whose life consisted &quot;of several strands.&quot; One was a relationship with a young woman, another was a concern with the banality of the life that we all live, and a third an obsession with proving himself and testing himself to find out what kind of character he had. Allen himself turned forty in 1975, and Brickman suggests that &quot;advancing age&quot; and &quot;worries about death&quot; had influenced Allen&#x27;s philosophical, personal approach to complement his &quot;commercial side&quot;. Allen made the conscious decision to &quot;sacrifice some of the laughs for a story about human beings&quot;. He recognized that for the first time he had the courage to abandon the safety of complete broad comedy and had the will to produce a film of deeper meaning which would be a nourishing experience for the audience. He was also influenced by Federico Fellini&#x27;s comedy drama &quot;8½&quot; (1963), created at a similar personal turning point, and similarly colored by each director&#x27;s psychoanalysis.

Brickman and Allen sent the screenplay back and forth until they were ready to ask United Artists for $4 million. Many elements from the early drafts did not survive. It was originally a drama centered on a murder mystery with a comic and romantic subplot. According to Allen, the murder occurred after a scene that remains in the film, the sequence in which Annie and Alvy miss the Ingmar Bergman film &quot;Face to Face&quot; (1976). Although they decided to drop the murder plot, Allen and Brickman made a murder mystery many years later: &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot; (1993), also starring Diane Keaton. The draft that Allen presented to the film&#x27;s editor, Ralph Rosenblum, concluded with the words, &quot;ending to be shot.&quot;

Allen suggested &quot;Anhedonia&quot;, a term for the inability to experience pleasure, as a working title, and Brickman suggested alternatives including &quot;It Had to Be Jew&quot;, &quot;Rollercoaster Named Desire&quot; and &quot;Me and My Goy&quot;. An advertising agency, hired by United Artists, embraced Allen&#x27;s choice of an obscure word by suggesting the studio take out newspaper advertisements that looked like fake tabloid headlines such as &quot;Anhedonia Strikes Cleveland!&quot;. However, Allen experimented with several titles over five test screenings, including &quot;Anxiety&quot; and &quot;Annie and Alvy&quot;, before settling on &quot;Annie Hall&quot;.

===Casting===
Several references in the film to Allen&#x27;s own life have invited speculation that it is autobiographical. Both Alvy and Allen were comedians. His birthday appears on the blackboard in a school scene, and &quot;Alvy&quot; was one of Allen&#x27;s childhood nicknames; certain features of his childhood are found in Alvy Singer&#x27;s; Allen went to New York University and so did Alvy. Diane Keaton&#x27;s real surname is &quot;Hall&quot; and &quot;Annie&quot; was her nickname, and she and Allen were once romantically involved. However, Allen is quick to dispel these suggestions. &quot;The stuff that people insist is autobiographical is almost invariably not,&quot; Allen said. &quot;It&#x27;s so exaggerated that it&#x27;s virtually meaningless to the people upon whom these little nuances are based. People got it into their heads that &quot;Annie Hall&quot; was autobiographical, and I couldn&#x27;t convince them it wasn&#x27;t&quot;. Contrary to various interviewers and commentators, he says, Alvy is not the character that is closest to himself; he identified more with the mother (Eve, played by Geraldine Page) in his next film, &quot;Interiors&quot;. Despite this, Keaton has stated that the relationship between Alvy and Annie was partly based on her relationship with the director.

The role of Annie Hall was written specifically for Keaton, who had worked with Allen on &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot; (1972), &quot;Sleeper&quot; (1973) and &quot;Love and Death&quot; (1975). She considered the character an &quot;affable version&quot; of herself—both were &quot;semi-articulate, dreamed of being a singer and suffered from insecurity&quot;—and was surprised to win an Oscar for her performance. The film also marks the second film collaboration between Allen and Tony Roberts, their previous project being &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;.

Federico Fellini was Allen&#x27;s first choice to appear in the cinema lobby scene because his films were under discussion, but Allen chose cultural academic Marshall McLuhan after both Fellini and Luis Buñuel declined the cameo. Some cast members, biographer John Baxter claims, were aggrieved at Allen&#x27;s treatment of them. The director &quot;acted coldly&quot; towards McLuhan, who had to return from Canada for reshooting, and Mordecai Lawner, who played Alvy&#x27;s father, claimed that Allen never spoke to him. However, during the production, Allen began a two-year relationship with Stacey Nelkin, who appears in a single scene.

===Filming, editing and music===

Principal photography began on May 19, 1976, on the South Fork of Long Island with the scene in which Alvy and Annie boil live lobsters; filming continued periodically for the next ten months, and deviated frequently from the screenplay. There was nothing written about Alvy&#x27;s childhood home lying under a roller coaster, but when Allen was scouting locations in Brooklyn with Willis and art director Mel Bourne, he &quot;saw this roller-coaster, and ... saw the house under it. And I thought, we have to use this.&quot; Similarly, there is the incident where Alvy scatters a trove of cocaine with an accidental sneeze: although not in the script, the joke emerged from a rehearsal happenstance and stayed in the movie. In audience testing, this laugh was so sustained that a much longer pause had to be added so that the following dialogue was not lost.

Editor Ralph Rosenblum&#x27;s first assembly of the film in 1976 left Brickman disappointed. &quot;I felt that the film was running off in nine different directions,&quot; Brickman recalled. &quot;It was like a first draft of a novel... from which two or three films could possibly be assembled.&quot; Rosenblum characterized the first cut, at two hours and twenty minutes, as &quot;the surrealistic and abstract adventures of a neurotic Jewish comedian who was reliving his highly flawed life and in the process satirizing much of our culture... a visual monologue, a more sophisticated and more philosophical version of &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot;&quot;. Brickman found it &quot;nondramatic and ultimately uninteresting, a kind of cerebral exercise.&quot; He suggested a more linear narrative.

The present-tense relationship between Alvy and Annie was not the narrative focus of this first cut, but Allen and Rosenblum recognized it as the dramatic spine, and began reworking the film &quot;in the direction of that relationship.&quot; Rosenblum recalled that Allen &quot;had no hesitation about trimming away much of the first twenty minutes in order to establish Keaton more quickly.&quot; According to Allen, &quot;I didn&#x27;t sit down with Marshall Brickman and say, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to write a picture about a relationship.&#x27; I mean the whole concept of the picture changed as we were cutting it.&quot;

As the film was budgeted for two weeks of post-production photography, late 1976 saw three separate shoots for the final segment, but only some of this material was used. The narration that ends the film, featuring the joke about &#x27;we all need the eggs&#x27;, was conceived and recorded only two hours before a test screening.

The credits call the film &quot;A Jack Rollins and Charles H. Joffe Production&quot;; the two men were Allen&#x27;s managers and received this same credit on his films from 1969 to 1993. However, for this film, Joffe took producer credit and therefore received the Academy Award for Best Picture. The title sequence features a black background with white text in the Windsor Light Condensed typeface, a design that Allen used on his subsequent films. Stig Björkman sees some similarity to Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s simple and consistent title design, although Allen says that his own choice is a cost-saving device.

Very little background music is heard in the film, a departure for Allen influenced by Ingmar Bergman. Diane Keaton performs twice in the jazz club: &quot;It Had to be You&quot; and &quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot; (the latter reprises in voiceover on the closing scene). The other exceptions include a boy&#x27;s choir &quot;Christmas Medley&quot; played while the characters drive through Los Angeles, the Molto allegro from Mozart&#x27;s Jupiter Symphony (heard as Annie and Alvy drive through the countryside), Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s performance of &quot;Sleepy Lagoon&quot;, and the anodyne cover of the Savoy Brown song &quot;A Hard Way to Go&quot; playing at a party in the mansion of Paul Simon&#x27;s character.

==Release==

===Box office and release===
&quot;Annie Hall&quot; was shown at the Los Angeles Film Festival on March 27, 1977, before its official release in the United States on April 20, 1977. The film ultimately earned $38,251,425 ($ million in dollars) in the United States and Canada against a $4-million budget, making it the 11th highest-grossing picture of 1977. On raw figures, it currently ranks as Allen&#x27;s fourth-highest-grossing film in the United States, after &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; and &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;; when adjusted for inflation, the gross figure makes it Allen&#x27;s biggest box office hit. It played for over 100 consecutive weeks in London and grossed over $5.6 million in the United Kingdom. It was first released on Blu-ray on January 24, 2012, alongside Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979). Both releases include their original theatrical trailers.

==Reception==

===Critical response===

&quot;Annie Hall&quot; met with widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with major praise directed towards the film&#x27;s script and the performances of Allen and Keaton.

Tim Radford of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the film &quot;Allen&#x27;s most closely focused and daring film to date&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Vincent Canby preferred &quot;Annie Hall&quot; to Allen&#x27;s second directorial effort, &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot;, since the former is more &quot;humane&quot; while the latter is more a &quot;cartoon&quot;. Several critics have compared the film favorably to Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; (1973), including Joseph McBride in &quot;Variety&quot;, who found it Allen&#x27;s &quot;most three-dimensional film to date&quot; with an ambition equal to Bergman&#x27;s best even as the co-stars become the &quot;contemporary equivalent of ... Tracy-Hepburn.&quot;

More critically, Peter Cowie commented that the film &quot;suffers from its profusion of cultural references and asides&quot;. Writing for &quot;New York&quot; magazine, John Simon called the film &quot;unfunny comedy, poor moviemaking, and embarrassing self-revelation,&quot; and wrote that Keaton&#x27;s performance was &quot;in bad taste to watch and indecency to display,&quot; saying that the part should have been played by Robin Mary Paris, the actress who appears briefly in the scene where Alvy Singer has written a two-character play nakedly based on himself and Annie Hall. Simon&#x27;s review of &quot;Annie Hall &quot; &quot;It is a film so shapeless, sprawling, repetitious, and aimless as to seem to beg for oblivion. At this, it is successful.&quot;

The film has continued to receive positive reviews. In his 2002 lookback, Roger Ebert added it to his Great Movies list and commented with surprise that the film had &quot;an instant familiarity&quot; despite its age, and &quot;Slant&quot; writer Jaime N. Christley found the one-liners &quot;still gut-busting after 35 years&quot;. A later &quot;Guardian&quot; critic, Peter Bradshaw, named it the best comedy film of all time, commenting that &quot;this wonderfully funny, unbearably sad film is a miracle of comic writing and inspired film-making&quot;. John Marriott of the &quot;Radio Times&quot; believed that &quot;Annie Hall&quot; was the film where Allen &quot;found his own singular voice, a voice that echoes across events with a mixture of exuberance and introspection&quot;, referring to the &quot;comic delight&quot; derived from the &quot;spirited playing of Diane Keaton as the kooky innocent from the Midwest, and Woody himself as the fumbling New York neurotic&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine rated the movie five out of five stars, calling it a &quot;classic&quot;. In 2017, Claire Dederer wrote, &quot;&quot;Annie Hall&quot; is the greatest comic film of the twentieth century [...] because it acknowledges the irrepressible nihilism that lurks at the center of all comedy.&quot;

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;Annie Hall&quot; as one of his favorite films.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 97% based on 128 reviews, with an average rating of 9.10/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Filled with poignant performances and devastating humor, &quot;Annie Hall&quot; represents a quantum leap for Woody Allen and remains an American classic.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 92 out of 100 based on 20 critical reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Critical analysis===

====Love and sexuality====

Sociologists Virginia Rutter and Pepper Schwartz consider Alvy and Annie&#x27;s relationship to be a stereotype of gender differences in sexuality. The nature of love is a repeating subject for Allen and co-star Tony Roberts described this film as &quot;the story of everybody who falls in love, and then falls out of love and goes on.&quot; Alvy searches for love&#x27;s purpose through his effort to get over his depression about the demise of his relationship with Annie. Sometimes he sifts through his memories of the relationship, at another point he stops people on the sidewalk, with one woman saying that &quot;It&#x27;s never something you do. That&#x27;s how people are. Love fades,&quot; a suggestion that it was no one&#x27;s fault, they just grew apart and the end was inevitable. By the end of the film, Alvy accepts this and decides that love is ultimately &quot;irrational and crazy and absurd&quot;, but a necessity of life. Christopher Knight believes Alvy&#x27;s quest upon meeting Annie is carnal, whereas hers is on an emotional note.

Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; notes the film&#x27;s &quot;Eurocentric art-house self-awareness&quot; and Alvy Singer&#x27;s &quot;psychoanalytic obsession in baring his sexual desires and frustrations, romantic disasters, and neurotic inhibitions&quot;.

====Jewish identity====
Singer is identified with the stereotypical neurotic Jewish male, and the differences between Alvy and Annie are often related to the perceptions and realities of Jewish identity. Vincent Brook notes that &quot;Alvy dines with the WASP-y Hall family and imagines that they must see him as a Hasidic Jew, complete with payot (ear locks) and a large black hat.&quot; Robert M. Seltzer and Norman J. Cohen highlight the scene in which Annie remarks that Annie&#x27;s grandmother &quot;hates Jews. She thinks they just make money, but she&#x27;s the one. Is she ever, I&#x27;m telling you.&quot;, revealing the hypocrisy in her grandmother&#x27;s stereotypical American view of Jews by arguing that &quot;no stigma attaches to the love of money in America&quot;. Bernd Herzogenrath also considers Allen&#x27;s joke, &quot;I would like to but we need the eggs&quot;, to the doctor at the end when he suggests putting him in a mental institution, to be a paradox of not only the persona of the urban neurotic Jew but also of the film itself.

====Woody Allen persona====
Christopher Knight points out that &quot;Annie Hall&quot; is framed through Alvy&#x27;s experiences. &quot;Generally, what we know about Annie and about the relationship comes filtered through Alvy, an intrusive narrator capable of halting the narrative and stepping out from it in order to entreat the audience&#x27;s interpretative favor.&quot; He suggests that because Allen&#x27;s films blur the protagonist with &quot;past and future protagonists as well as with the director himself&quot;, it &quot;makes a difference as to whether we are most responsive to the director&#x27;s or the character&#x27;s framing of events&quot;. Despite the narrative&#x27;s framing, &quot;the joke is on Alvy.&quot; Emanuel Levy believes that Alvy Singer became synonymous with the public perception of Woody Allen in the United States. &quot;Annie Hall&quot; is viewed as the definitive Woody Allen film in displaying neurotic humor.

====Location====

&quot;Annie Hall&quot; &quot;is as much a love song to New York City as it is to the character,&quot; reflecting Allen&#x27;s adoration of the island of Manhattan. It was a relationship he explored repeatedly, particularly in films like &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979) and &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986). Annie Hall&#x27;s apartment, which still exists on East 70th Street between Lexington Avenue and Park Avenue is by Allen&#x27;s own confession his favorite block in the city. Peter Cowie argues that the film shows &quot;a romanticized view&quot; of the borough, with the camera &quot;linger[ing] on the Upper East Side [... and where] the fear of crime does not trouble its characters.&quot; By contrast, California is presented less positively, and David Halle notes the obvious &quot;invidious intellectual comparison&quot; between New York City and Los Angeles. While Manhattan&#x27;s movie theaters show classic and foreign films, Los Angeles theaters run less-prestigious fare such as &quot;The House of Exorcism&quot; and &quot;Messiah of Evil&quot;. Rob&#x27;s demonstration of adding canned laughter to television demonstrates the &quot;cynical artifice of the medium&quot;. New York City serves as a symbol of Alvy&#x27;s personality (&quot;gloomy, claustrophobic, and socially cold, but also an intellectual haven full of nervous energy&quot;) while Los Angeles is a symbol of freedom for Annie.

====Psychoanalysis and modernism====
&quot;Annie Hall&quot; has been cited as a film which uses both therapy and analysis for comic effect. Sam B. Girgus considers &quot;Annie Hall&quot; to be a story about memory and retrospection, which &quot;dramatizes a return via narrative desire to the repressed and the unconscious in a manner similar to psychoanalysis&quot;. He argues that the film constitutes a self-conscious assertion of how narrative desire and humor interact in the film to reform ideas and perceptions and that Allen&#x27;s deployment of Freudian concepts and humor forms a &quot;pattern of skepticism toward surface meaning that compels further interpretation&quot;. Girgus believes that proof of the pervasiveness of Sigmund Freud in the film is demonstrated at the beginning through a reference to a joke in &quot;Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious&quot;, and makes another joke about a psychiatrist and patient, which Girgus argues is also symbolic of the dynamic between humor and the unconscious in the film. Further Freudian concepts are later addressed in the film with Annie&#x27;s recall of a dream to her psychoanalyst in which Frank Sinatra is smothering her with a pillow, which alludes to Freud&#x27;s belief in dreams as &quot;visual representations of words or ideas&quot;.

Peter Bailey in his book &quot;The Reluctant Film Art of Woody Allen&quot;, argues that Alvy displays a &quot;genial denigration of art&quot; which contains a &quot;significant equivocation&quot;, in that in his self-deprecation he invites the audience to believe that he is leveling with them. Bailey argues that Allen&#x27;s devices in the film, including the subtitles which reveal Annie&#x27;s and Alvy&#x27;s thoughts &quot;extend and reinforce &quot;Annie Hall&quot;″s winsome ethos of plain-dealing and ingenuousness&quot;. He muses that the film is full of antimimetic emblems such as McLuhan&#x27;s magical appearance which provide quirky humor and that the &quot;disparity between mental projections of reality and actuality&quot; drives the film. His view is that self-reflective cinematic devices intelligently dramatize the difference between surface and substance, with visual emblems &quot;incessantly distilling the distinction between the world mentally constructed and reality&quot;.

In his discussion of the film&#x27;s relation to modernism, Thomas Schatz finds the film an unresolved &quot;examination of the process of human interaction and interpersonal communication&quot; and &quot;immediately establishes [a] self-referential stance&quot; that invites the spectator &quot;to read the narrative as something other than a sequential development toward some transcendent truth&quot;. For him, Alvy &quot;is the victim of a tendency toward overdetermination of meaning – or in modernist terms &#x27;the tyranny of the signified&#x27; – and his involvement with Annie can be viewed as an attempt to establish a spontaneous, intellectually unencumbered relationship, an attempt which is doomed to failure.&quot;

==Accolades==

&quot;Annie Hall&quot; won four Oscars at the 50th Academy Awards on April 3, 1978, and was nominated for five (the Big Five) in total. Producer Charles H. Joffe received the statue for Best Picture, Allen for Best Director and, with Brickman, for Best Original Screenplay, and Keaton for Best Actress. Allen was also nominated for Best Actor. Many had expected &quot;Star Wars&quot; to win the major awards, including Brickman and executive producer Robert Greenhut.

The film was also honored five times at the BAFTA awards. Along with the top award for Best Film and the award for Best Editing, Keaton won for Best Actress, Allen won for Best Direction and Best Original Screenplay alongside Brickman. The film received one Golden Globe Award, for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical (Keaton), in addition to four nominations: Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (the latter three for Allen).

In 1992, the United States&#x27; Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in its National Film Registry that includes &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; films. The film is often mentioned among the greatest comedies of all time. The American Film Institute lists it 31st in American cinema history. In 2000, they named it second greatest romantic comedy in American cinema. Keaton&#x27;s performance of &quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot; was ranked 90th on their list of greatest songs included in a film, and her line &quot;La-dee-da, la-dee-da.&quot; was named the 55th greatest movie quote. The screenplay was named the sixth greatest screenplay by the Writers Guild of America, West while IGN named it the seventh greatest comedy film of all time. In 2000, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine voted it the forty-second greatest comedy film of all time, and the seventh greatest romantic comedy film of all time. Several lists ranking Allen&#x27;s best films have put &quot;Annie Hall&quot; among his greatest work.

In June 2008, AFI revealed its 10 Top 10—the best ten films in ten classic American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community and &quot;Annie Hall&quot; was placed second in the romantic comedy genre. AFI also ranked &quot;Annie Hall&quot; on several other lists. In November 2008, &quot;Annie Hall&quot; was voted in at No. 68 on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. It is also ranked No. 2 on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; 25 Best Romantic Comedies, second only to &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;. In 2012, the film was listed as the 127th best film of all time by the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll. The film was also named the 132nd best film by the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; directors&#x27; poll.
In October 2013, the film was voted by the &quot;Guardian&quot; readers as the second best film directed by Woody Allen. In November 2015, the film was named the funniest screenplay by the Writers Guild of America in its list of &quot;101 Funniest Screenplays&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine ranked Keaton in Annie Hall as 60th in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Performances of All Time&quot;, and noted:
It&#x27;s hard to play ditzy. ... The genius of Annie is that despite her loopy backhand, awful driving, and nervous tics, she&#x27;s also a complicated, intelligent woman. Keaton brilliantly displays this dichotomy of her character, especially when she yammers away on a first date with Alvy (Woody Allen), while the subtitle reads, &quot;He probably thinks I&#x27;m a yoyo.&quot; Yo-yo? Hardly.
===Legacy and influence===

Although the film received widespread critical acclaim and numerous awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, and said in an interview, &quot;When &quot;Annie Hall&quot; started out, that film was not supposed to be what I wound up with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy&#x27;s mind ... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and Diane Keaton was all anyone cared about. That was not what I cared about ... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie&quot;. Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that &quot;Sequelism has become an annoying thing. I don&#x27;t think Francis Coppola should have done &quot;Godfather III&quot; because &quot;Godfather II&quot; was quite great. When they make a sequel, it&#x27;s just a thirst for more money, so I don&#x27;t like that idea so much&quot;.

Diane Keaton has stated that Annie Hall was her favorite role and that the film meant everything to her. When asked if being most associated with the role concerned her as an actress, she replied, &quot;I&#x27;m not haunted by Annie Hall. I&#x27;m happy to be Annie Hall. If somebody wants to see me that way, it&#x27;s fine by me&quot;. Costume designer Ruth Morley, working with Keaton, created a look which had an influence on the fashion world during the late-70s, with women adopting the style: layering oversized, mannish blazers over vests, billowy trousers or long skirts, a man&#x27;s tie, and boots. The look was often referred to as the &quot;&quot;Annie Hall&quot; look&quot;. Some sources suggest that Keaton herself was mainly responsible for the look, and Ralph Lauren has often claimed credit, but only one jacket and one tie were purchased from Ralph Lauren for use in the film. Allen recalled that Lauren and Keaton&#x27;s dress style almost did not end up in the film. &quot;She came in,&quot; he recalled in 1992, &quot;and the costume lady on &quot;Annie Hall&quot; said, &#x27;Tell her not to wear that. She can&#x27;t wear that. It&#x27;s so crazy.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Leave her. She&#x27;s a genius. Let&#x27;s just leave her alone, let her wear what she wants.

The film&#x27;s script topped the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s list of 101 funniest screenplays ever, surpassing &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959), &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; (1993), &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), and &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982). James Bernardoni states that the film is &quot;one of the very few romantic comedy-dramas of the New Hollywood era and one that has rightly taken its place among the classics of that revered genre&quot;, likening the seriocomic meditation on the couple relationship to George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; (1949), starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Since its release, other romantic comedies have inspired comparison. &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; (1989), &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; (1997), &quot;Burning Annie&quot; (2007), &quot;500 Days of Summer&quot; (2009) and Allen&#x27;s 2003 film, &quot;Anything Else&quot;, are among them, while film director Rian Johnson said in an interview for the book, &quot;The Film That Changed My Life&quot;, that &quot;Annie Hall&quot; inspired him to become a film director. Karen Gillan stated that she watched &quot;Annie Hall&quot; as part of her research for her lead role in &quot;Not Another Happy Ending&quot;. In 2018, Matt Starr and Ellie Sachs released a short film remake starring senior citizens.

<text>The D4 was a rock band from Auckland, New Zealand. Their music was released by Hollywood Records in the U.S., Flying Nun Records in New Zealand and by Infectious Records in the UK.

The group was assembled by vocalist/guitarists Dion Palmer and Jimmy Christmas, who put together a collection of songs and built a four-piece combo, featuring founding members English Jake and Rich Mixture, during late 1998 and started playing at the Frisbee Leisure Lounge parties along Symonds Street, followed shortly thereafter by inner city pub gigs. They have also played at the Big Day Out and at the SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Texas.

The group&#x27;s debut EP was released by Flying Nun Records in 1999 featuring the tracks &quot;Girl&quot; and &quot;Come On!&quot;. The band was later enhanced by members Vaughan Williams (Vaughn) (bass) and Daniel Pooley (Beaver) (drums). The D4 went on a UK tour supporting The Hives.

As of May 2006, &quot;Breakfast&quot; announced that after eight years, the D4, would be taking an indefinite break from the music industry. After the split, Rich Mixture went on to replace Paul Robertson as the drummer of The Rock n Roll Machine, bassist Vaughn joined Shocking Pinks, an Auckland-based indie pop act and Jimmy Christmas formed the rock group Luger Boa who have supported Shihad on tour. Most recently, Dion has moved to NYC, formed a new band called The True Lovers and also plays bass in A Place to Bury Strangers.

<doc id="66873" wikidata="Q1216011" url="?curid=66873" title="The Battle of San Pietro">
<text>The Battle of San Pietro is a documentary film directed by John Huston about the Battle of San Pietro Infine, from Naples, during World War II. It was shot by Jules Buck. It was released in the US in 1945 but shown to US troops earlier.

Huston and his crew—which included the British novelist and screenwriter Eric Ambler—were attached to the U.S. Army’s 143rd Regiment of the 36th Division. Unlike with many other military documentaries, it was claimed Huston’s cameramen filmed alongside the infantrymen as they fought their way up the hills to reach San Pietro. However, Huston&#x27;s claim that the film was made during the battle was proven false by the research of Peter Maslowski in his 1993 book, &quot;Armed With Cameras&quot;.

==Production==

The film was made to be intentionally more realistic than other examples of its genre. One scene includes close-up views of the faces of dead soldiers as they are being loaded into body bags, a level of realism unheard of in both fictional portrayals as well as newsreel footage of the time.
The United States Army delayed its release to the public because it showed dead GIs wrapped in mattress covers; some officers tried to prevent soldiers in training from seeing it, for fear of damaging morale. General George Marshall came to Huston and took the film&#x27;s defense, stating that because of the film&#x27;s gritty realism, it would make a good training film. The depiction of death would inspire soldiers to take their training more seriously.

Huston quickly became unpopular with the Army, not only for the film but also for his response to the accusation that the film was anti-war. Huston responded that if he ever made a pro-war film, he should be shot. The film was screened to U.S. troops in North Africa in 1944, where John Horne Burns described it in a letter as &quot;almost more than any heart can stand&quot;. Huston was no longer considered a pariah; he was decorated and eventually promoted to major.

==Reception==
In 1991, &quot;The Battle of San Pietro&quot; was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2005.

<doc id="66877" wikidata="Q193357" url="?curid=66877" title="Daphne du Maurier">
<text>Dame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning, (; 13 May 1907 – 19 April 1989) was an English novelist, biographer and playwright. Her parents were actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and his wife, actress Muriel Beaumont. Her grandfather George du Maurier was a writer and cartoonist.

Although du Maurier is classed as a romantic novelist, her stories have been described as &quot;moody and resonant&quot; with overtones of the paranormal. Her bestselling works were not at first taken seriously by critics, but they have since earned an enduring reputation for narrative craft. Many have been successfully adapted into films, including the novels &quot;Rebecca&quot;, &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot; and &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;, and the short stories &quot;The Birds&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;. Du Maurier spent much of her life in Cornwall, where most of her works are set. As her fame increased, she became more reclusive.

==Life==
===Early life===

Daphne du Maurier was born at 24 Cumberland Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park, London, the middle of three daughters of prominent actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and actress Muriel Beaumont. Her paternal grandfather was author and &quot;Punch&quot; cartoonist George du Maurier, who created the character of Svengali in the 1894 novel &quot;Trilby&quot;. Her paternal uncle Guy du Maurier was a playwright. Her mother was a paternal niece of journalist, author, and lecturer Comyns Beaumont. Her elder sister, Angela du Maurier, became an actress and later also a writer, and her younger sister Jeanne du Maurier was a painter. She was a cousin of the Llewelyn Davies boys, who were J. M. Barrie&#x27;s inspiration for the characters in the play &quot;Peter Pan; or, The Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot;. She was also a cousin of director Gabrielle Beaumont.

As a child, du Maurier met many prominent theatre actors, because of the celebrity of her father. On meeting Tallulah Bankhead, du Maurier was quoted as saying that Bankhead was the most beautiful creature she had ever seen.

Du Maurier spent her childhood at Cannon Hall, Hampstead, the family&#x27;s London residence, and summers at their home in Fowey, Cornwall, where they also lived during the war years.

===Personal life===

Du Maurier married Major (later Lieutenant-General) Frederick &quot;Boy&quot; Browning in 1932. They had three children:
* Tessa (b. 1933), who married Major Peter Paul John de Zulueta. After they divorced, she married David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, in 1970.
* Flavia (b. 1937), who married Captain Alastair Tower. After they divorced, she married General Sir Peter Leng.
* Christian (b. 1940), a photographer and filmmaker. He married Olive White (Miss Ireland 1961).

She was known as Daphne du Maurier from 1907 to 1932, when she married Frederick Browning. Still writing as Daphne du Maurier during her marriage, she was also known as Lady Browning after her husband was knighted in 1946.

Biographers have claimed that du Maurier&#x27;s marriage was at times somewhat chilly, and that she could be aloof and distant to her children, especially the girls, when immersed in her writing. She has often been painted as a frostily private recluse who rarely mixed in society or gave interviews, but many people remembered her as a warm and immensely funny person in private who was a welcoming hostess to guests at Menabilly, the house that she had leased for many years, from the Rashleigh family in Cornwall.

Her husband died in 1965 and soon afterward Daphne moved to Kilmarth, near Par, Cornwall, which became the setting for &quot;The House on the Strand&quot;, and where she became an early member of Mebyon Kernow, a Cornish nationalist party.

An exception to her reticence to give interviews came after the release of the film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, based on a book by Cornelius Ryan, in which her late husband was portrayed in a less-than-flattering light. Incensed, she wrote to the national newspapers, decrying what she considered unforgivable treatment. 

She appeared as a castaway in the BBC Radio programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; broadcast on 3 September 1977. Her chosen book was &quot;The Collected Works of Jane Austen&quot;, and her luxury was whisky and ginger ale.

When she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1969, she was titled Dame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning, DBE, but she never used the title. According to her biographer Margaret Forster, she told no one about the honour, so that even her children learned of it only from the newspapers. &quot;She thought of pleading illness for the investiture, until her children insisted it would be a great day for the older grandchildren. So she went through with it, though she slipped out quietly afterwards to avoid the attention of the press.&quot;

===Relationships===
&quot;The Daphne du Maurier Companion&quot;, edited by Helen Taylor, includes Taylor&#x27;s claims that du Maurier confessed to her in 1965 that she had had an incestuous relationship with her father and that he had been a violent alcoholic. Du Maurier stated in her memoirs that because her father had wanted a son, she became a tomboy, in an attempt to get the parental approval she would have had, had she been born a boy.

In correspondence that her family released to biographer Margaret Forster, du Maurier explained to a trusted few people that she felt her personality comprised two distinct people – the loving wife and mother side she showed to the world, and the lover side, a &quot;decidedly male energy&quot;, hidden from virtually everyone, which was the power behind her artistic creativity. According to Forster&#x27;s biography, du Maurier believed the &quot;male energy&quot; propelled her writing.

After du Maurier&#x27;s death in 1989, some writers speculated about her alleged intimate physical relationships with a number of women, including Ellen Doubleday, the wife of her U.S. publisher Nelson Doubleday, and the actress Gertrude Lawrence, as detailed in the 2007 BBC Two film, &quot;Daphne&quot;. &quot;The children of both du Maurier and Lawrence have objected strongly to the stories about the alleged relationship between their mothers.&quot; 

Two years after Lawrence died, a biography of her written by her widower, Richard Aldrich, went into detail about a friendship between her and du Maurier that had begun in 1948 when Lawrence had accepted the lead role in du Maurier&#x27;s new play &quot;September Tide&quot;. Aldrich said that Lawrence had toured Britain in the play in 1948 and continued with it in London&#x27;s West End theatre district through 1949, and that later du Maurier visited them at their home in the United States. Aldrich made no mention of a possible same-sex relationship.

===Death===
Du Maurier died from heart failure in her sleep on 19 April 1989, aged 81, at her home in Par, Cornwall, which had been the setting for many of her books. Her body was cremated in private and without a memorial service (at her request) and her ashes scattered off the cliffs around Kilmarth and Menabilly, Cornwall.

== Writing career ==
===Novels, short stories, and biographies===
Her family connections helped her establish her literary career, and she published some of her early work in her great uncle Comyns Beaumont&#x27;s &quot;Bystander&quot; magazine. Her first novel, &quot;The Loving Spirit,&quot; was published in 1931.

The novel &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1938) was du Maurier&#x27;s most successful work. It was an immediate hit, selling nearly 3 million copies between 1938 and 1965. The novel has never gone out of print. In the United States, du Maurier won the National Book Award for favourite novel of 1938, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. In the UK, it was listed at number 14 of the &quot;nation&#x27;s best-loved novel&quot;s on the BBC&#x27;s 2003 survey The Big Read.

Other significant works include &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;, &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Hungry Hill&quot;, &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot;, &quot;The Scapegoat&quot;, &quot;The House on the Strand&quot;, and &quot;The King&#x27;s General&quot;. The last is set in Cornwall during the English Civil War, and is written from the Royalist perspective. 

Du Maurier was often categorised as a &quot;romantic novelist&quot;, a term that she deplored, given that her novels rarely have a happy ending, and often have sinister overtones and shadows of the paranormal. In this light, she has more in common with the &quot;sensation novels&quot; of Wilkie Collins and others, which she admired. The critic Kate Kellaway wrote: &quot;Du Maurier was mistress of calculated irresolution. She did not want to put her readers&#x27; minds at rest. She wanted her riddles to persist. She wanted the novels to continue to haunt us beyond their endings.&quot;

Du Maurier&#x27;s novel &quot;Mary Anne&quot; (1954) is a fictionalised account of her great-great-grandmother, Mary Anne Clarke née Thompson (1776–1852), who, from 1803 to 1808, was mistress of Frederick Augustus, Duke of York and Albany (1763–1827). He was the &quot;Grand Old Duke of York&quot; of the nursery rhyme, a son of King George III, and brother of King George IV and King William IV. The central character of her last novel, &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;, is an aging actress, thought to be based on Gladys Cooper (to whom it is dedicated).

Du Maurier&#x27;s short stories are darker: &quot;The Birds&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;, &quot;The Apple Tree&quot;, and &quot;The Blue Lenses&quot; are finely crafted tales of terror that shocked and surprised her audience in equal measure. As her biographer Margaret Forster wrote, &quot;She satisfied all the questionable criteria of popular fiction, and yet satisfied too the exacting requirements of &#x27;real literature&#x27;.&quot;

The discovery, in 2011, of a collection of du Maurier&#x27;s forgotten short stories, written when the author was 21, provides some insight into her mature style. One of them, &quot;The Doll&quot;, concerns a young woman&#x27;s obsession with a mechanical male sex doll; it has been deemed by du Maurier&#x27;s son Kit Browning to be &quot;quite ahead of its time&quot;.

She also wrote non-fiction, including several biographies such as &quot;Gerald&quot;, her father&#x27;s biography. &quot;The Glass-Blowers&quot; traces her French Huguenot ancestry and vividly depicts the French Revolution. &quot;The du Mauriers&quot; traces the family&#x27;s move from France to England in the 19th century.

&quot;The House on the Strand&quot; (1969) combines elements of &quot;mental time-travel&quot;, a tragic love affair in 14th-century Cornwall, and the dangers of using mind-altering drugs. Her final book, &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; (1972), was not well-received, her biographer, Margaret Forster, considering it to be the author&#x27;s poorest novel.

===Film adaptations===
&quot;Rebecca&quot; has been adapted for both stage and screen several times, most notably by Alfred Hitchcock in his 1940 film &quot;Rebecca&quot;. Several of du Maurier&#x27;s other novels have also been adapted for the screen, including &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;, &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Hungry Hill&quot;, and &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot; in both 1952 and 2017. The Hitchcock film &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963) is based on a treatment of the short story of that name, as is the film &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; (1973). Of the films, du Maurier often complained that the only ones she liked were Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot; and Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;.

Hitchcock&#x27;s treatment of &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; was disavowed by both director and author, due to a complete re-write of the ending to accommodate the ego of its star, Charles Laughton. Du Maurier also felt that Olivia de Havilland was wrongly cast as the anti-heroine of &quot;My Cousin Rachel (1952)&quot;. &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek&quot; fared better in a lavish Technicolor version released in 1944. Du Maurier later regretted her choice of Alec Guinness as the lead in the film of &quot;The Scapegoat&quot;, which she partly financed.

===Playwright===
Du Maurier wrote three plays. Her first was an adaptation of her novel &quot;Rebecca&quot;, which opened at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in London on 5 March 1940 in a production by George Devine, starring Celia Johnson and Owen Nares as the De Winters and Margaret Rutherford as Mrs. Danvers. After 181 performances, the production transferred to the Strand Theatre, with Jill Furse taking over as the second Mrs. De Winter and Mary Merrall as Mrs. Danvers, with a further run of 176 performances.

In 1943 she wrote the autobiographically inspired drama &quot;The Years Between&quot; about the unexpected return of a senior officer, thought killed in action, who finds that his wife has taken his seat as Member of Parliament (MP) and has started a romantic relationship with a local farmer. It was first staged at the Manchester Opera House in 1944 and then transferred to London, opening at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre on 10 January 1945, starring Nora Swinburne and Clive Brook. The production, directed by Irene Hentschel, became a long-running hit, completing 617 performances. It was revived by Caroline Smith at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond upon Thames on 5 September 2007, starring Karen Ascoe and Mark Tandy.

Her third play, &quot;September Tide&quot;, portrays a middle-aged woman whose bohemian artist son-in-law falls in love with her. Again directed by Irene Hentschel, it opened at the Aldwych Theatre on 15 December 1948 with Gertrude Lawrence as Stella. It closed in August 1949 after 267 performances.

===Accusations of plagiarism===
Two authors accused Du Maurier of plagiarism, but were unable to prove their claims.
====&quot;Rebecca&quot;====
Shortly after &quot;Rebecca&quot; was published in Brazil, critic Álvaro Lins and other readers pointed out many resemblances to the 1934 book, &quot;A Sucessora&quot; (&quot;The Successor&quot;), by Brazilian writer Carolina Nabuco. According to Nabuco and her editor, not only the main plot, but also situations and entire dialogues had been copied. Du Maurier denied having copied Nabuco&#x27;s book, as did her publisher, pointing out that the plot elements said to have been plagiarised were quite common.

The controversy was examined in a 2002 article by Larry Rohter in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. According to Nabuco&#x27;s memoirs, when the Hitchcock film &quot;Rebecca&quot; was first shown in Brazil, United Artists wanted Nabuco to sign a document stating that the similarities were merely a coincidence but she refused. Rohter quotes Nabuco&#x27;s memoirs as saying, When the film version of &#x27;Rebecca&#x27; came to Brazil, the producers&#x27; lawyer sought out my lawyer to ask him that I sign a document admitting the possibility of there having been a mere coincidence. I would be compensated with a quantity described as &#x27;of considerable value.&#x27; I did not consent, naturally. Rohter remarked: &quot;Nabuco had translated her novel into French and sent it to a publisher in Paris, who she learned was also Ms. du Maurier&#x27;s [publisher] only after &quot;Rebecca&quot; became a worldwide success. The novels have identical plots and even some identical episodes.&quot;

====&quot;The Birds&quot;====
Author Frank Baker&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Birds&quot;, was published by Peter Davies in 1936. Baker stated that it bore some resemblance to &quot;The Terror&quot; by Arthur Machen (first published 1917). When Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot; was released in 1963, based on &quot;The Birds&quot; (1952) by du Maurier, Baker considered litigation against Universal Studios but his legal counsel stated: &quot;The treatment of the general idea of attacks by birds in the two works is as different as it could be.&quot;

Du Maurier denied that she had ever read Baker&#x27;s book. Some sources claim that Du Maurier was a reader for Davies in 1936, but she was already a successful author by then, and spent most of 1936 in Alexandria with her family. 

==Cultural references==
* Du Maurier&#x27;s love of the outdoors and walking were written about in Annabel Abbs&#x27;s book &quot;Windswept: Walking in the Footsteps of Remarkable Women&quot; (Two Roads, 2021) as she retraced the writer&#x27;s walk along the Rhône river in France, accompanied by her Cornish neighbour and friend Clara Vyvyan.
* The dialogue of Nikos Nikolaidis&#x27; 1987 film &quot;Morning Patrol&quot; contains excerpts of du Maurier&#x27;s published works.
* Daphne du Maurier was one of five &quot;Women of Achievement&quot; selected for a set of British stamps issued in August 1996.
* English Heritage caused controversy in June 2008 by denying an application to commemorate her home in Hampstead with a Blue Plaque. In 2011 a plaque was mounted on Cannon Cottage in Well Street, Hampstead, put up by the Heath and Hampstead Society.
* In 2013, grandson Ned Browning released a collection of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s watches based on characters from the novel &quot;Rebecca&quot;, under the brand name &quot;du Maurier Watches&quot;.
