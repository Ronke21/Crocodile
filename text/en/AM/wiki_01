<text>In the United Kingdom, the Civil Service is the permanent bureaucracy or secretariat of Crown employees that supports His Majesty&#x27;s Government, the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government, which is led by a cabinet of ministers chosen by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

As in other states that employ the Westminster political system, the Civil Service – often known by the metonym of [[Whitehall]] – forms an inseparable part of the British government. The executive decisions of government ministers are implemented by the Civil Service. Civil servants are employees of the Crown and not of the British parliament. Civil servants also have some traditional and statutory responsibilities which to some extent protect them from being used for the political advantage of the party in power. Senior civil servants may be called to account to Parliament.

In general use, the term &quot;civil servant&quot; in the United Kingdom does not include all public sector employees. Although there is no fixed legal definition, the term is usually defined as a &quot;servant of the Crown working in a civil capacity who is not the holder of a political (or judicial) office; the holder of certain other offices in respect of whose tenure of office special provision has been made; [or] a servant of the Crown in a personal capacity paid from the Civil List&quot;. As such, the civil service does not include government ministers (who are politically appointed); members of the British Armed Forces; police officers; officers of local government authorities; employees of some non-departmental public bodies; officers or staff of either of the Houses of Parliament; employees of the National Health Service (NHS); or staff of the Royal Household. As of the end of March 2021 there were 484,880 civil servants in the Civil Service, an increase of 6.23 per cent on the previous year.

The Northern Ireland Civil Service is a separate civil service in the United Kingdom.

==History==
===Establishment===
The Offices of State grew in England, and later the United Kingdom centred around the street Whitehall, hence the metonym. Initially, they were little more than s for their leaders, who held positions at court. They were chosen by the king on the advice of a patron, and typically replaced when their patron lost influence. In the 18th century, in response to the growth of the British Empire and economic changes, institutions such as the Office of Works and the Navy Board grew large. Each had its own system and staff were appointed by purchase or patronage. By the 19th century, it became increasingly clear that these arrangements were not working.

Under Charles Grant, the East India Company established the East India Company College at Haileybury near London, to train administrators, in 1806. The college was established on recommendation of officials in China who had seen the imperial examination system. In government, a civil service, replacing patronage with examination, similar to the Chinese system, was advocated a number of times over the next several decades.

William Ewart Gladstone, in 1850, an opposition member, sought a more efficient system based on expertise rather than favouritism. The East India Company provided a model for Stafford Northcote, private Secretary to Gladstone who, with Charles Trevelyan, drafted the key report in 1854. The Northcote–Trevelyan Report recommended a permanent, unified, politically neutral civil service, with appointments made on merit, and a clear division between staff responsible for routine (&quot;mechanical&quot;) and those engaged in policy formulation and implementation (&quot;administrative&quot;) work. The report was not implemented, but it came as the bureaucratic chaos in the Crimean War demonstrated that the military was as backward as the civil service. A Civil Service Commission was set up in 1855 to oversee open recruitment and end patronage as Parliament passed an Act &quot;to relieve the East India Company from the obligation to maintain the College at Haileybury&quot;. Prime Minister Gladstone took the decisive step in 1870 with his Order in Council to implement the Northcote-Trevelyan proposals. This system was broadly endorsed by commissions chaired by Playfair (1874), Ridley (1886), MacDonnell (1914), Tomlin (1931) and Priestley (1955).

The Northcote–Trevelyan model remained essentially stable for a hundred years. This was attributed to its success in removing corruption, delivering public services, even under stress of war, and responding effectively to political change. Patrick Diamond argues:
The Irish Civil Service was separate from the British Civil Service. Whilst the Acts of Union 1800 abolished the Parliament of Ireland, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was retained in formal charge of the Irish executive based at Dublin Castle. The Irish Office in Whitehall liaised with Dublin Castle. Some British departments&#x27; area of operation extended to Ireland, while in other fields the Dublin department was separate from the Whitehall equivalent.

===Lord Fulton&#x27;s committee report===
Following the Second World War demands for change grew again. There was a concern (illustrated in C. P. Snow&#x27;s &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot; series of novels) that technical and scientific expertise was mushrooming, to a point at which the &quot;good all-rounder&quot; culture of the administrative civil servant with a classics or other arts degree could no longer properly engage with it: as late as 1963, for example, the Treasury had just 19 trained economists. The times were, moreover, ones of keen respect for technocracy, with the mass mobilisation of war having worked effectively, and the French National Plan apparently delivering economic success. And there was also a feeling which would not go away, following the war and the radical social reforms of the 1945 Labour government, that the so-called &quot;mandarins&quot; of the higher civil service were too remote from the people. Indeed, between 1948 and 1963 only three per cent of the recruits to the administrative class came from the working classes, and in 1966 more than half of the administrators at undersecretary level and above had been privately educated.

Lord Fulton&#x27;s committee reported in 1968. He found that administrators were not professional enough, and in particular lacked management skills; that the position of technical and scientific experts needed to be rationalised and enhanced; and that the service was indeed too remote. His 158 recommendations included the introduction of a unified grading system for all categories of staff, a Civil Service College and a central policy planning unit. He also said that control of the service should be taken from the Treasury, and given to a new department, and that the &quot;fast stream&quot; recruitment process for accessing the upper echelons should be made more flexible, to encourage candidates from less privileged backgrounds. The new department was set up by Prime Minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour Government in 1968 and named the Civil Service Department, known as CSD. Wilson himself took on the role of Minister for the Civil Service (which has continued to be a portfolio of the Prime Minister), while the first Minister in Charge of the Civil Service Department was Cabinet Minister Lord Shackleton, also Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal. The first Permanent Secretary was Sir William Armstrong, who moved over from his post as Permanent Secretary at the Treasury. After the 1970 General Election, new Conservative Prime Minister Ted Heath appointed Lord Jellicoe in Lord Shackleton&#x27;s place.

Into Heath&#x27;s Downing Street came the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS), and they were in particular given charge of a series of Programme Analysis and Review (PAR) studies of policy efficiency and effectiveness.

But, whether through lack of political will, or through passive resistance by a mandarinate which the report had suggested were &quot;amateurs&quot;, Fulton failed. The Civil Service College equipped generalists with additional skills, but did not turn them into qualified professionals as ENA did in France. Recruits to the fast stream self-selected, with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge still producing a large majority of successful English candidates, since the system continued to favour the tutorial system at Oxbridge while to an extent the Scottish Ancient universities educated a good proportion of recruits from north of the border. The younger mandarins found excuses to avoid managerial jobs in favour of the more prestigious postings. The generalists remained on top, and the specialists on tap.

===Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government===
Margaret Thatcher came to office in 1979 believing in free markets as a better social system in many areas than the state: government should be small but active. Many of her ministers were suspicious of the civil service, in light of public choice research that suggested public servants (as well as elected officials themselves) tend to act in ways that seek to increase their own power and budgets.

She immediately set about reducing the size of the civil service, cutting numbers from 732,000 to 594,000 over her first seven years in office. Derek Rayner, the former chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, was appointed as an efficiency expert with the Prime Minister&#x27;s personal backing; he identified numerous problems with the Civil Service, arguing that only three billion of the eight billion pounds a year spent at that time by the Civil Service consisted of essential services, and that the &quot;mandarins&quot; (senior civil servants) needed to focus on efficiency and management rather than on policy advice. In late 1981 the Prime Minister announced the abolition of the Civil Service Department, transferring power over the Civil Service to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office and Cabinet Office. The Priestley Commission principle of pay comparability with the private sector was abandoned in February 1982.

Meanwhile, Michael Heseltine was introducing a comprehensive system of corporate and business planning (known as MINIS) first in the Department of the Environment and then in the Ministry of Defence. This led to the &quot;Financial Management Initiative&quot;, launched in September 1982 (&quot;Efficiency and Effectiveness in the Civil Service&quot; (Cmnd 8616)) as an umbrella for the efficiency scrutiny programme and with a wider focus on corporate planning, efficiency and objective-setting. Progress initially was sluggish, but in due course MINIS-style business planning became standard, and delegated budgets were introduced, so that individual managers were held much more accountable for meeting objectives, and for the first time for the resources they used to do so. Performance-related pay began in December 1984, was built on thereafter, and continues to this day, though the sums involved have always been small compared to the private sector, and the effectiveness of PRP as a genuine motivator has often been questioned.

In February 1988 Robin Ibbs, who had been recruited from ICI in July 1983 to run the Efficiency Unit (now in No. 10), published his report &quot;Improving Management in Government: The Next Steps&quot;. This envisaged a new approach to delivery featuring clear targets and personal responsibility. Without any statutory change, the managerial functions of Ministries would be hived off into Executive Agencies, with clear Framework Documents setting out their objectives, and whose chief executives would be made accountable directly (in some cases to Parliament) for performance. Agencies were to, as far as possible, take a commercial approach to their tasks. However, the Government conceded that agency staff would remain civil servants, which diluted the radicalism of the reform. The approach seems somewhat similar to the Swedish model, though no influence from Sweden has ever been acknowledged.

The Next Steps Initiative took some years to get off the ground, and progress was patchy. Significant change was achieved, although agencies never really achieved the level of autonomy envisaged at the start. By 5 April 1993, 89 agencies had been established, and contained over 260,000 civil servants, some 49 per cent of the total.

The focus on smaller, more accountable, units revived the keenness of Ministerial interest in the perceived efficiencies of the private sector. Already in the late 1980s, some common services once set up to capture economies of scale, such as the Property Services Agency and the Crown Suppliers, were being dismantled or sold off. Next, shortly after Thatcher left office, in July 1991, a new programme of market-testing of central government services began, with the White Paper &quot;Competing for Quality&quot; (Cm 1730). Five-yearly or three-yearly policy and finance reviews of all agencies and other public bodies were instituted, where the first question to be answered (the &quot;prior options exercise&quot;) was why the function should not be abolished or privatised. In November 1991 the private finance initiative was launched, and by November 1994 the Chancellor of the Exchequer had referred to it as &#x27;the funding mechanism of choice for most public sector projects&#x27;. In 1995 the decision was taken to privatise the Chessington Computer Centre, HMSO, the Occupational Health &amp; Safety Agency and Recruitment &amp; Assessment Services.

===The Citizen&#x27;s Charter===
It was believed with the Thatcher reforms that efficiency was improving. But there was still a perception of carelessness and lack of responsiveness in the quality of public services. The government of John Major sought to tackle this with a Citizen&#x27;s Charter programme. This sought to empower the service user, by setting out rights to standards in each service area, and arrangements for compensation when these were not met. An Office of Public Service and Science was set up in 1992, to see that the Charter policy was implemented across government.

By 1998, 42 Charters had been published, and they included services provided by public service industries such as the health service and the railways, as well as by the civil service. The programme was also expanded to apply to other organisations such as local government or housing associations, through a scheme of &quot;Chartermark&quot; awards. The programme was greeted with some derision, and it is true that the compensation sometimes hardly seemed worth the effort of claiming, and that the service standards were rarely set with much consumer input. But the initiative did have a significant effect in changing cultures, and paradoxically the spin-off Chartermark initiative may have had more impact on local organisations uncertain about what standards to aim for, than the parent Citizen&#x27;s Charter programme itself.

==Governance==

===Minister for the Civil Service===

The position of Minister for the Civil Service is not part of the Civil Service as it is a political position which has always been held by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

===Head of the Civil Service===
The highest ranking civil servant is the Cabinet Secretary. A subsidiary title that was also held by the incumbent is &quot;Head of the Civil Service&quot; (previously &quot;Head of the Home Civil Service&quot;), who until recently was also the Permanent Secretary of the Cabinet Office. However, following the Coalition Government of David Cameron the three posts were split from the single holder. The last person to hold all three positions together was Gus O&#x27;Donnell, Cabinet Secretary, Head of the Home Civil Service and Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary, August 2005 – December 2011. The postholder is responsible for ensuring that the Civil Service is equipped with the skills and capability to meet the everyday challenges it faces and that civil servants work in a fair and decent environment. The postholder also chairs the Permanent Secretary Management Group and the Civil Service Steering Board which are the main governing bodies of the Civil Service.

It was announced on 11 October 2011 that, following O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s retirement at the end of 2011, the role of Head of the Home Civil Service would be split from the post of Cabinet Secretary; there would additionally be a new, separate, Permanent Secretary to lead the Cabinet Office. After O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s retirement, Jeremy Heywood replaced him as Cabinet Secretary – serving until 24 October 2018 when he retired on health grounds; Ian Watmore as Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary; and lastly, Bob Kerslake as Head of the Civil Service. In July 2014 it was announced that Kerslake would step down and Heywood would take the title of Head of the HCS while John Manzoni would be Chief Executive of the Civil Service. From 24 October 2018 to 4 November 2018, the office of Head of the Civil Service was vacant, as Heywood resigned on health grounds. Following Heywood&#x27;s death, Mark Sedwill was given the additional Civil Service portfolio. Simon Case succeeded Mark Sedwill as Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Home Civil Service in 2020 until resigning in December 2024 on health grounds. Sir Chris Wormald took over the roles on 16 December 2024.

===Permanent Secretaries Management Group (PSMG)===
The PSMG considers issues of strategic importance to the Civil Service as a whole, as well as providing corporate leadership where a single position is required across all government departments. It is chaired by the Head of the Civil Service and consists of all first permanent secretaries and other selected permanent secretaries and directors general. This includes the Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and the Head of the Diplomatic Service.

===Civil Service Steering Board (CSSB)===
The CSSB was established in 2007 and meets monthly. Its role is to enhance the performance and reputation of the Civil Service by focusing on specific areas delegated to it by PSMG. The CSSB is chaired by the Head of the Civil Service.

===Civil Service Commissioners===

The Civil Service Commissioners are not civil servants and are independent of Ministers, they are appointed directly by the Crown under Royal Prerogative and they report annually to the King.

Their main role is regarding the recruitment of civil servants. They have the responsibility to ensure that all civil servants are recruited on the &quot;principle of selection on merit on the basis of fair and open competition.&quot; They maintain a recruitment code on the interpretation and application of that principle, and approve any exceptions to it. They audit recruitment policies and practices within the Civil Service and approve all appointments to the most senior levels of the Civil Service.

The Commissioners also hear and determine appeals in cases of concern about propriety and conscience raised by civil servants under the Civil Service Code which cannot be resolved through internal procedures.

Northern Ireland has a separate Commission called the &quot;Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland&quot; which has the same role.

==Political neutrality==
The Civil Service is meant to be a politically neutral body, with the function of impartially implementing the policy programme of the elected government.

Like all servants of the Crown, civil servants are legally barred from standing for election as Members of Parliament as they must uphold the duty of being politically neutral. Under regulations first adopted in 1954 and revised in 1984, members of the Senior Civil Service (the top management grades) are barred from holding office in a political party or publicly expressing controversial political viewpoints, while less senior civil servants at an intermediate (managerial) level must generally seek permission to participate in political activities. The most junior civil servants are permitted to participate in political activities, but must be politically neutral in the exercise of their duties. In periods prior to General Elections, the Civil Service undergoes purdah which further restricts their activities.

All civil servants are subject to the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989, meaning that they may not disclose sensitive government information. Since 1998, there have also been restrictions on contact between civil servants and lobbyists; this followed an incident known as Lobbygate, where an undercover reporter for &quot;The Observer&quot;, posing as a business leader, was introduced by a lobbyist to a senior Downing Street official who promised privileged access to government ministers. The Committee on Standards in Public Life, also created in 1998, is responsible for regulation of contacts between public officials and lobbyists.

The increasing influence of politically appointed special advisers in government departments can reduce the political neutrality of public administration. In Thatcher&#x27;s government, Alan Walters was an official adviser from 1981 to 1984, and again in 1989. Walters&#x27; criticisms &quot;of many aspects of Treasury policy, particularly in relation to exchange rate policy&quot; and Thatcher&#x27;s refusal to dismiss him led to Nigel Lawson&#x27;s resignation as chancellor in 1989. Thatcher also claimed that the 1981 budget, which increased taxes during the recession and was criticised by 364 economists, had been devised by Walters.
In 2000, then-Prime Minister Tony Blair was criticised for appointing 20 special advisers (compared to eight under his predecessor John Major) and for the fact that the total salary cost of special advisers across all government departments had reached £4 million. In 2001, Stephen Byers, then Secretary of State for Transport, was forced to resign because of the actions of his special adviser Jo Moore, who instructed a departmental civil servant, Martin Sixsmith, that September 11, 2001, would be &quot;a good day to bury bad news&quot;; this was seen as inappropriate political manipulation of the Civil Service. In particular, under the administration of Tony Blair, the influence of two Downing Street special advisers, Jonathan Powell and Alastair Campbell, both of whom were given formal power over Downing Street civil servants, provoked widespread criticism.

The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government of 2010–2015 had proposed introducing a more American style system where senior civil servants, such as permanent secretaries, became political appointees. However, this was dropped after it was considered that the existing permanent civil service style was better-suited to the government of the United Kingdom.

The political neutrality of the civil service was called into question during the 2016–2019 Brexit negotiations, with political figures such as Brexit Party Leader Nigel Farage accusing the civil service of having a &quot;pro-Remain bias&quot;. In response Sir Mark Sedwill, Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Civil Service, issued a letter to all Department Chiefs warning that Brexit was having an &quot;unsettling&quot; effect on civil servants.

In March 2023, Home Secretary Suella Braverman, in an email sent to Conservative Party supporters, criticised civil servants as being part of an &quot;activist blob of left-wing lawyers, civil servants and the Labour Party&quot; which blocked government efforts to stop small boat crossings. Dave Penman, general secretary of the Association of First Division Civil Servants, accused Braverman of breaching the ministerial code. In response, a Conservative Party spokesperson said that the Home Secretary had not seen the wording of the email prior to its sending.

==Codes==

===Civil Service Code===

A version of the civil service code was introduced in 2006 to outline the core values and standards expected of civil servants. The core values are defined as &quot;integrity&quot;, &quot;honesty&quot;, &quot;objectivity&quot;, and &quot;impartiality&quot;. A key change from previous values is the removal of &quot;anonymity&quot; within the core values. The Code includes an independent line of appeal to the Civil Service Commissioners on alleged breaches of the Code.

 a version updated in March 2015, with the same core values, was current. In addition to civil servants, special advisers are also covered by the code, except, due to the nature of the role, for the requirements for objectivity and impartiality.

===Civil Service Management Code===
The Civil Service Management Code (CSMC) sets out the regulations and instructions to departments and agencies regarding the terms and conditions of service of civil servants. It is the guiding document which gives delegation to civil service organisations, from the Minister for the Civil Service, in order for them to make internal personnel policies.

===Civil Service Commissioners&#x27; Recruitment Code===
The Civil Service Commissioners&#x27; Recruitment Code is maintained by the Civil Service Commissioners and is based on the &quot;principle of selection on merit on the basis of fair and open competition.&quot;

===Osmotherly Rules===
The Osmotherly Rules set out guidance on how civil servants should respond to Parliamentary select committees.

===Directory of Civil Service Guidance===
A two-volume 125-page &quot;Directory of Civil Service Guidance&quot; was published in 2000 to replace the previous &quot;Guidance on Guidance&quot;, providing short summaries of guidance on a wide range of issues and pointing to more detailed sources.

==Structure==
The structure of the Civil Service is divided into organisations, grades and professions. Each Secretary of State has a Department which has executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies subordinate to it.

===Grading schemes===
The grading system used in the civil service has changed many times, and the current structure is made up of two schemes. All senior grades (Deputy Director / Grade 5 level and above) are part of the senior civil service, which is overseen by the Cabinet Office on behalf of the civil service as a whole. Below the senior civil service, each individual department/executive agency can put in place its own grading and pay arrangements, provided they still comply with the central civil service pay and review guidance.

For other grades many departments overlay their own grading structure, however all these structures must map across to the central government structure as shown below.

All current grades are marked in and historical grade names are shown &quot;italics&quot;.

NB – XXX is standing in for

=== Professions ===
The &quot;lingua franca&quot; is to describe civil servants, and in particular their grades, predominantly through a lens of administrative activity (as in the current structure of the table above), but in practice the civil service has, and always had, a number of subdivisions, with the Historic Grades having an additional designator (usually omitted for senior managers, but included from middle and junior managers) as shown as &quot;xxx&quot;, with the major groupings being:
* Executive ([x]EO)
* Scientific ([x]SO)
* Professional and Technology ([x]PTO)
The Current Structure identifies a number of distinct professional groupings:
* Communications and Marketing
* Economics
* Engineering
* Finance
* Human Resources
* Digital, Data and Technology (formerly Information Technology)
* Inspector of Education and Training
* Internal Audit
* Knowledge and Information Management
* Law
* Medicine
* Operational Delivery
* Operational Research
* Policy Delivery
* Procurement and Contract Management
* Programme and Project Management
* Property Asset Management
* Psychology
* Science
* Social Research
* Statistics
* Tax Professionals
* Veterinarian
* Other (for minority groups, such as Investigating Officers)

Recruitment data from the 2018 Civil Service Fast Stream process showed that white applicants were 15 times more likely to be recruited than black candidates.

== Privilege days ==
A privilege day is a day of annual leave granted to employees of the civil service. These are in addition to bank holidays.

Before 2013, there were 2.5 privilege days each year:

* The King&#x27;s Official Birthday. This is a full day usually attached to the Spring Bank Holiday, the last Monday in May, on either the Friday before the Bank Holiday or the Tuesday after (in order to create a four-day weekend), originally allocated in respect of the King&#x27;s Official Birthday. In practice, the day the privilege day is taken is subject to local management policies; many staff prefer to take it at a date of their own discretion.
* Maundy Thursday. This was a half day on the afternoon of the Thursday of Holy Week.
* Christmas. This was an extra full day of leave at Christmas, in addition to the bank holidays of Christmas and Boxing Day. It was often arranged so as to connect the Christmas bank holidays to an adjacent weekend.

Since reforms by the Cabinet Office in 2013, the Maundy Thursday (Easter) and Christmas privilege days are no longer available for new civil servants. For civil servants who were in their positions when the changes came into force, these 1.5 days have been converted into additional annual leave, but lost upon promotion. Because the Queen&#x27;s Birthday privilege day was granted by Queen Elizabeth II after her coronation, it would have been difficult for the Cabinet Office to abolish it by an administrative measure, so the Cabinet Office decided to retain this as a privilege day. Privilege days still count as &quot;working days&quot; for the purpose of freedom of information requests.

==In popular culture==
The BBC television series &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; are a satire on the British civil service and its relationship with government ministers. The portrayal is a caricature of the civil service predominantly characterised through Sir Nigel Hawthorne&#x27;s Sir Humphrey Appleby.

&quot;The Thick of It&quot;, first broadcast in 2005, is a similar BBC television series that has been called &quot;the 21st century&#x27;s answer to &quot;Yes Minister&quot;&quot;. The series portrays a modernised version of the interactions between the Civil Service and the Government (chiefly in the form of special advisers), as well as the media&#x27;s involvement in the process.

There is a long history of civil servants who are also literary authors, who often comment on their own institutions, including such writers as Geoffrey Chaucer, John Milton, John Dryden, Andrew Marvell, Robert Burns, William Wordsworth and Anthony Trollope, and diarist Samuel Pepys.

<text>Randomization is a statistical process in which a random mechanism is employed to select a sample from a population or assign subjects to different groups. The process is crucial in ensuring the random allocation of experimental units or treatment protocols, thereby minimizing selection bias and enhancing the statistical validity. It facilitates the objective comparison of treatment effects in experimental design, as it equates groups statistically by balancing both known and unknown factors at the outset of the study. In statistical terms, it underpins the principle of probabilistic equivalence among groups, allowing for the unbiased estimation of treatment effects and the generalizability of conclusions drawn from sample data to the broader population.

Randomization is not haphazard; instead, a random process is a sequence of random variables describing a process whose outcomes do not follow a deterministic pattern but follow an evolution described by probability distributions. For example, a random sample of individuals from a population refers to a sample where every individual has a known probability of being sampled. This would be contrasted with nonprobability sampling, where arbitrary individuals are selected. A runs test can be used to determine whether the occurrence of a set of measured values is random. Randomization is widely applied in various fields, especially in scientific research, statistical analysis, and resource allocation, to ensure fairness and validity in the outcomes.

In various contexts, randomization may involve

* Generating Random Permutations: This is essential in various situations, such as shuffling cards. By randomly rearranging the sequence, it ensures fairness and unpredictability in games and experiments.
* Selecting Random Samples from Populations: In statistical sampling, this method is vital for obtaining representative samples. By randomly choosing a subset of individuals, biases are minimized, ensuring that the sample accurately reflects the larger population.
* Random Allocation in Experimental Design: Random assignment of experimental units to treatment or control conditions is fundamental in scientific studies. This approach ensures that each unit has an equal chance of receiving any treatment, thereby reducing systematic bias and improving the reliability of experimental results.
* Generating Random Numbers: The process of random number generation is central to simulations, cryptographic applications, and statistical analysis. These numbers form the basis for simulations, model testing, and secure data encryption.
* Data Stream Transformation: In telecommunications, randomization is used to transform data streams. Techniques like scramblers randomize the data to prevent predictable patterns, which is crucial for securing communication channels and enhancing transmission reliability.&quot;

Randomization has many uses in gambling, political use, statistical analysis, art, cryptography, gaming and other fields. 

== In gambling ==

In the world of gambling, the integrity and fairness of games hinge significantly on effective randomization. This principle serves as a cornerstone in gambling, ensuring that each game outcome is unpredictable and not manipulable. The necessity for advanced randomization methods stems from the potential for skilled gamblers to exploit weaknesses in poorly randomized systems. High-quality randomization thwarts attempts at prediction or manipulation, maintaining the fairness of games. A quintessential example of randomization in gambling is the shuffling of playing cards. This process must be thoroughly random to prevent any predictability in the order of cards. Casinos often employ automatic shuffling machines, which enhance randomness beyond what manual shuffling can achieve.

With the rise of online casinos, digital random number generators (RNGs) have become crucial. These RNGs use complex algorithms to produce outcomes that are as unpredictable as their real-world counterparts. The gambling industry invests heavily in research to develop more effective randomization techniques. To ensure that gambling games are fair and random, regulatory bodies rigorously test and certify shuffling and random number generation methods. This oversight is vital in maintaining trust in the gambling industry, ensuring that players have equal chances of winning.

The unpredictability inherent in randomization is also a key factor in the psychological appeal of gambling. The thrill and suspense created by the uncertainty of outcomes contribute significantly to the allure and excitement of gambling games.

In summary, randomization in gambling is not just a technical necessity; it is a fundamental principle that upholds the fairness, integrity, and thrill of the games. As technology advances, so too do the methods to ensure that this randomization remains effective and beyond reproach

== In politics ==
The concept of randomization in political systems, specifically through the method of allotment or sortition, has ancient roots and contemporary relevance, significantly impacting the evolution and practice of democracy.

In the fifth century BC, Athenian democracy was pioneering in its approach to ensuring political equality, or isonomia. Central to this system was the principle of random selection, seen as a cornerstone for fair representation. The unique structure of Greek democracy, which translates to &quot;rule by the people,&quot; was exemplified by administrative roles being rotated among citizens, selected randomly through lot. This method was perceived as more democratic than elections, which the Athenians argued could lead to inequalities. They believed that elections, which often favored candidates based on merit or popularity, contradicted the principle of equal rights for all citizens. Furthermore, the random allotment of positions like magistrates or jury members served as a deterrent to vote-buying and corruption, as it was impossible to predict who would be chosen for these roles.
In modern times, the concept of allotment, also known as sortition, is primarily seen in the selection of jurors within Anglo-Saxon legal systems, such as those in the UK and the United States. However, its political implications extend further. There have been various proposals to integrate sortition into government structures. The idea is that sortition could introduce a new dimension of representation and fairness in political systems, countering issues associated with electoral politics. This concept has garnered academic interest, with scholars exploring the potential of random selection in enhancing the democratic process, both in political frameworks and organizational structures. The ongoing study and debate surrounding the use of sortition reflect its enduring relevance and potential as a tool for political innovation and integrity.

== Randomization in statistical analysis ==
Randomization is a core principle in statistical theory, whose importance was emphasized by Charles S. Peirce in &quot;Illustrations of the Logic of Science&quot; (1877–1878) and &quot;A Theory of Probable Inference&quot; (1883). Its application in statistical methodologies is multifaceted and includes critical processes such as randomized controlled experiments, survey sampling and simulations.

=== Randomized controlled experiment ===

In the realm of scientific research, particularly within clinical study designs, constraints such as limited manpower, material resources, financial backing, and time necessitate a selective approach to participant inclusion. Despite the broad spectrum of potential participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria, it is impractical to incorporate every eligible individual in the target population due to these constraints. Therefore, a representative subset of treatment groups is chosen based on the specific requirements of the research. A randomized sampling method is employed to ensure the integrity and representativeness of the study. This method ensures that all qualified subjects within the target population have an equal opportunity to be selected. Such a strategy is pivotal in mirroring the overall characteristics of the target population and in mitigating the risk of selection bias.

The selected samples (or continuous non-randomly sampled samples) are grouped using randomization methods so that all research subjects in the sample have an equal chance of entering the experimental group or the control group and receiving corresponding treatment. In particular, the random grouping after the research subjects are stratified can make the known or unknown influencing factors between the groups basically consistent, thereby enhancing the comparability between the groups.

=== Survey sampling ===
Survey sampling uses randomization, following the criticisms of previous &quot;representative methods&quot; by Jerzy Neyman in his 1922 report to the International Statistical Institute. It randomly displays the answer options to survey participants, which prevents order bias caused by the tendency of respondents to choose the first option when the same order is presented to different respondents. To overcome this, researchers can give the answer options in a random order so that the respondents allocate some time to read all the options and choose an honest answer. For example, consider an automobile dealer who wants to conduct a feedback survey and ask the respondents to select their preferred automobile brand. The user can create a study with randomized answers to display the different automobile brands so that the respondents do not see them in the same order.

=== Resampling ===
Some important methods of statistical inference use resampling from the observed data. Multiple alternative versions of the data-set that &quot;might have been observed&quot; are created by randomization of the original data-set, the only one observed. The variation of statistics calculated for these alternative data-sets is a guide to the uncertainty of statistics estimated from the original data.

=== Simulation ===

In many scientific and engineering fields, computer simulations of real phenomena are commonly used. When the real phenomena are affected by unpredictable processes, such as radio noise or day-to-day weather, these processes can be simulated using random or pseudo-random numbers. One of the most prominent uses of randomization in simulations is in Monte Carlo methods. These methods rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results, typically to model probability distributions or to estimate uncertain quantities in a system.

Randomization also allows for the testing of models or algorithms against unexpected inputs or scenarios. This is essential in fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence, where algorithms must be robust against a variety of inputs and conditions.

== In cryptography ==
== In art ==
Randomization plays a fascinating and often underappreciated role in literature, music, and art, where it introduces elements of unpredictability and spontaneity. Here is how it manifests in each of these creative fields:

=== Literature ===

Pioneered by surrealists and later popularized by writers like William S. Burroughs, automatic writing and cut-up techniques involve randomly rearranging text to create new literary forms. It disrupts linear narratives, fostering unexpected connections and meanings.

=== Music ===
In aleatoric music, elements of the composition are left to chance or the performer&#x27;s discretion. Composers like John Cage used randomization to create music where certain elements are unforeseeable, resulting in each performance being uniquely different. Modern musicians sometimes employ computer algorithms that generate music based on random inputs. These compositions can range from electronic music to more classical forms, where randomness plays a key role in creating harmony, melody, or rhythm.
=== Art ===
Some artists in abstract expressionism movement, like Jackson Pollock, used random methods (like dripping or splattering paint) to create their artworks. This approach emphasizes the physical act of painting and the role of chance in the artistic process.Also, contemporary artists often use algorithms and computer-generated randomness to create visual art. This can result in intricate patterns and designs that would be difficult or impossible to predict or replicate manually.

==Techniques==
Although historically &quot;manual&quot; randomization techniques (such as shuffling cards, drawing pieces of paper from a bag, spinning a roulette wheel) were common, nowadays automated techniques are mostly used. As both selecting random samples and random permutations can be reduced to simply selecting random numbers, random number generation methods are now most commonly used, both hardware random number generators and pseudo-random number generators.

===Optimization===
Randomization is used in optimization to alleviate the computational burden associated to robust control techniques: a sample of values of the uncertainty parameters is randomly drawn and robustness is enforced for these values only. This approach has gained popularity by the introduction of rigorous theories that permit one to have control on the probabilistic level of robustness, see scenario optimization.

<doc id="65463" wikidata="Q128560" url="?curid=65463" title="Graham Greene">
<text>Henry Graham Greene (2 October 1904 – 3 April 1991) was an English writer and journalist regarded by many as one of the leading novelists of the 20th century.

Combining literary acclaim with widespread popularity, Greene acquired a reputation early in his lifetime as a major writer, both of serious Catholic novels, and of thrillers (or &quot;entertainments&quot; as he termed them). He was shortlisted for the Nobel Prize in Literature several times. Through 67 years of writing, which included over 25 novels, he explored the conflicting moral and political issues of the modern world. &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; won the 1941 Hawthornden Prize and &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; won the 1948 James Tait Black Memorial Prize and was shortlisted for the Best of the James Tait Black. Greene was awarded the 1968 Shakespeare Prize and the 1981 Jerusalem Prize. Several of his stories have been filmed, some more than once, and he collaborated with filmmaker Carol Reed on &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949).

He converted to Catholicism in 1926 after meeting his future wife, Vivien Dayrell-Browning. Later in life he took to calling himself a &quot;Catholic agnostic&quot;.
He died in 1991, aged 86, of leukemia, and was buried in Corseaux cemetery in Switzerland. William Golding called Greene &quot;the ultimate chronicler of twentieth-century man&#x27;s consciousness and anxiety&quot;.

== Early years (1904–1922) ==
Henry Graham Greene was born in 1904 in St John&#x27;s House, a boarding house of Berkhamsted School, Hertfordshire, where his father was house master. He was the fourth of six children; his younger brother, Hugh, became Director-General of the BBC, and his elder brother, Raymond, an eminent physician and mountaineer.

His parents, Charles Henry Greene and Marion Raymond Greene, were first cousins, both members of a large, influential family that included the owners of Greene King Brewery, bankers, and statesmen; his grandmother Jane Wilson was first cousin to Robert Louis Stevenson.

Charles Greene was second master at Berkhamsted School, where the headmaster was Dr Thomas Fry, who was married to Charles&#x27; cousin. Another cousin was the right-wing pacifist Ben Greene, whose politics led to his internment during World War II.

In his childhood, Greene spent his summers at Harston House, the Cambridgeshire home of his uncle, Sir Graham Greene. In Greene&#x27;s description of his childhood, he describes his learning to read there: &quot;It was at Harston I quite suddenly found that I could read—the book was &quot;Dixon Brett, Detective&quot;. I didn&#x27;t want anyone to know of my discovery, so I read only in secret, in a remote attic, but my mother must have spotted what I was at all the same, for she gave me Ballantyne&#x27;s &quot;Coral Island&quot; for the train journey home—always an interminable journey with the long wait between trains at Bletchley...&quot;

In 1910, Charles Greene succeeded Dr Fry as headmaster of Berkhamsted. Graham also attended the school as a boarder. Bullied and profoundly depressed, he made several suicide attempts, including, as he wrote in his autobiography, by Russian roulette and by taking aspirin before going swimming in the school pool. In 1920, aged 16, in what was a radical step for the time, he was sent for psychoanalysis for six months in London, afterwards returning to school as a day student. School friends included the journalist Claud Cockburn and the historian Peter Quennell.

Greene contributed several stories to the school magazine, one of which was published by a London evening newspaper in January 1921.

===Oxford University===
He attended Balliol College, Oxford, to study history. During 1922 Greene was for a short time a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and sought an invitation to the new Soviet Union, of which nothing came. In 1925, while he was an undergraduate at Balliol, his first work, a poorly received volume of poetry titled &quot;Babbling April&quot;, was published.

Greene had periodic bouts of depression while at Oxford, and largely kept to himself. Of Greene&#x27;s time at Oxford, his contemporary Evelyn Waugh noted that: &quot;Graham Greene looked down on us (and perhaps all undergraduates) as childish and ostentatious. He certainly shared in none of our revelry.&quot; He graduated in 1925 with a second-class degree in history.

== Writing career ==
After leaving Oxford, Greene worked as a private tutor and then turned to journalism; first on the &quot;Nottingham Journal&quot;, and then as a sub-editor on &quot;The Times&quot;. While he was still at Oxford, he had started corresponding with Vivien Dayrell-Browning, who had written to him to correct him on a point of Catholic doctrine. Greene was an agnostic, but when he later began to think about marrying Vivien, it occurred to him that, as he puts it in his autobiography &quot;A Sort of Life&quot;, he &quot;ought at least to learn the nature and limits of the beliefs she held&quot;. Greene was baptised on 28 February 1926 and they married on 15 October 1927 at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Hampstead, London.

He published his first novel, &quot;The Man Within&quot;, in 1929; its favourable reception enabled him to work full-time as a novelist. Greene originally divided his fiction into two genres (which he described as &quot;entertainments&quot; and &quot;novels&quot;): thrillers—often with notable philosophic edges—such as &quot;The Ministry of Fear&quot;; and literary works—on which he thought his literary reputation would rest—such as &quot;The Power and the Glory.&quot;

The next two books, &quot;The Name of Action&quot; (1930) and &quot;Rumour at Nightfall&quot; (1932), were unsuccessful, and he later disowned them. His first true success was &quot;Stamboul Train&quot; (1932) which was taken on by the Book Society and adapted as the film &quot;Orient Express&quot;, in 1934.

Although Greene objected to being described as a Roman Catholic novelist, rather than as a novelist who happened to be Catholic, Catholic religious themes are at the root of much of his writing, especially &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;, &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot;, &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;, and &quot;The End of the Affair&quot;, which have been named &quot;the gold standard&quot; of the Catholic novel. Several works, such as &quot;The Confidential Agent&quot;, &quot;The Quiet American&quot;, &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot;, &quot;The Human Factor&quot;, and his screenplay for &quot;The Third Man&quot;, also show Greene&#x27;s avid interest in the workings and intrigues of international politics and espionage. In the early 1930s Greene moved to the left politically. He read left-wing writers like G.D.H. Cole and John Strachey; in 1933 he joined the Independent Labour Party. This move to the left is reflected in the characters and plot of his fifth novel &quot;It&#x27;s A Battlefield&quot;. His later political affiliations and convictions were more ambiguous.

He supplemented his novelist&#x27;s income with freelance journalism, book and film reviews for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and co-editing the magazine &quot;Night and Day&quot;. Greene&#x27;s 1937 film review of &quot;Wee Willie Winkie&quot;, for &quot;Night and Day&quot;—which said that the nine-year-old star, Shirley Temple, displayed &quot;a dubious coquetry&quot; which appealed to &quot;middle-aged men and clergymen&quot;—provoked Twentieth Century Fox successfully to sue for £3,500 plus costs, and Greene left the UK to live in Mexico until after the trial was over. While in Mexico, Greene developed the ideas for the novel often considered his masterpiece, &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot;.

By the 1950s, Greene had become known as one of the finest writers of his generation.

As his career lengthened, both Greene and his readers found the distinction between his &#x27;entertainments&#x27; and novels increasingly problematic. The last book Greene termed an entertainment was &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot; in 1958.

Greene also wrote short stories and plays, which were well received, although he was always first and foremost a novelist. His first play, &quot;The Living Room&quot;, debuted in 1953.

Michael Korda, a lifelong friend and later his editor at Simon &amp; Schuster, observed Greene at work: Greene wrote in a small black leather notebook with a black fountain pen and would write approximately 500 words. Korda described this as Graham&#x27;s daily penance—once he finished he put the notebook away for the rest of the day.

His writing influences included Henry James, Robert Louis Stevenson, H. Rider Haggard, Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, Marcel Proust, Charles Péguy and John Buchan.

=== Travel and espionage ===

Throughout his life, Greene travelled to what he called the world&#x27;s wild and remote places. In 1941, the travels led to his being recruited into MI6 by his sister, Elisabeth, who worked for the agency. Accordingly, he was posted to Sierra Leone during the Second World War. Kim Philby, who would later be revealed as a Soviet agent, was Greene&#x27;s supervisor and friend at MI6. Greene resigned from MI6 in 1944. He later wrote an introduction to Philby&#x27;s 1968 memoir, &quot;My Silent War&quot;. 
Greene also corresponded with intelligence officer and spy, John Cairncross, for forty years and that correspondence is held by the John J. Burns Library, at Boston College.

Part of Greene&#x27;s reputation as a novelist is for weaving the characters he met and the places where he lived into the fabric of his novels.

Greene first left Europe at 30 years of age in 1935 on a trip to Liberia that produced the travel book &quot;Journey Without Maps&quot;. His 1938 trip to Mexico to see the effects of the government&#x27;s campaign of forced anti-Catholic secularisation was paid for by the publishing company Longman, thanks to his friendship with Tom Burns. That voyage produced two books, the nonfiction &quot;The Lawless Roads&quot; (published as &quot;Another Mexico&quot; in the US) and the novel &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot;. In 1953, the Holy Office informed Greene that &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; was damaging to the reputation of the priesthood; but later, in a private audience with Greene, Pope Paul VI told him that, although parts of his novels would offend some Catholics, he should ignore the criticism.

In 1954, Greene travelled to Haiti, where &quot;The Comedians&quot; (1966) is set, and which was then under the rule of dictator François Duvalier, known as &quot;Papa Doc&quot;, frequently staying at the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince. He visited Haiti again in the late 1950s. As inspiration for his novel &quot;A Burnt-Out Case&quot; (1960), Greene spent time travelling around Africa visiting a number of leper colonies in the Congo Basin and in what were then the British Cameroons. During this trip in late February and early March 1959, Greene met several times with Andrée de Jongh, a leader in the Belgian resistance during WWII, who famously established an escape route to Gibraltar through the Pyrenees for downed allied airmen.

In 1957, just months after Fidel Castro began his final revolutionary assault on the Batista regime in Cuba, Greene played a small role in helping the revolutionaries, as a secret courier transporting warm clothing for Castro&#x27;s rebels hiding in the hills during the Cuban winter. Castro, like Daniel Ortega and Omar Torrijos, was one of several Latin American leaders Greene&#x27;s friendship with whom has led some commentators to question his commitment to democracy. After one visit Castro gave Greene a painting he had done, which hung in the living room of the French house where the author spent the last years of his life. Greene did later voice doubts about Castro, telling a French interviewer in 1983, &quot;I admire him for his courage and his efficiency, but I question his authoritarianism,&quot; adding: &quot;All successful revolutions, however idealistic, probably betray themselves in time.&quot;

=== Publishing career ===

Between 1944 and 1948, Greene was director at Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode under chairman Douglas Jerrold, in charge of developing its fiction list. Greene created &quot;The Century Library&quot; series, which was discontinued after he left following a conflict with Jerrold regarding Anthony Powell&#x27;s contract. In 1958, Greene was offered the position of chairman by Oliver Crosthwaite-Eyre, but declined.

He was a director at The Bodley Head from 1957 to 1968 under Max Reinhardt.

== Personal life ==

Greene was an agnostic, but was baptised into the Catholic faith in 1926 after meeting his future wife Vivien Dayrell-Browning. They were married on 15 October 1927 at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Hampstead, north London. The Greenes had two children, Lucy Caroline (born 1933) and Francis (born 1936).

In his discussions with Father Trollope, the priest to whom he went for instruction in Catholicism, Greene argued with the cleric &quot;on the ground of dogmatic atheism&quot;, as Greene&#x27;s primary difficulty with religion was what he termed the &quot;if&quot; surrounding God&#x27;s existence. He found, however, that &quot;after a few weeks of serious argument the &#x27;if&#x27; was becoming less and less improbable&quot;, and Greene converted and was baptised after vigorous arguments initially with the priest in which he defended atheism, or at least the &quot;if&quot; of agnosticism. Late in life, Greene called himself a &quot;Catholic agnostic&quot;.

Beginning in 1946, Greene had an affair with Catherine Walston, the wife of Henry Walston, a wealthy farmer and future life peer. That relationship is generally thought to have informed the writing of &quot;The End of the Affair&quot;, published in 1951, when the relationship came to an end. Greene left his family in 1947, but Vivien refused to grant him a divorce, in accordance with Catholic teaching, and they remained married until Greene&#x27;s death in 1991.

Greene lived with manic depression (bipolar disorder). He had a history of depression, which had a profound effect on his writing and personal life. In a letter to his wife, he told her that he had &quot;a character profoundly antagonistic to ordinary domestic life&quot;, and that &quot;unfortunately, the disease is also one&#x27;s material&quot;.

== Final years ==
Greene left Britain in 1966, moving to Antibes, to be close to Yvonne Cloetta, whom he had known since 1959, a relationship that endured until his death. In 1973, he had an uncredited cameo appearance as an insurance company representative in François Truffaut&#x27;s film &quot;Day for Night&quot;. In 1981, Greene was awarded the Jerusalem Prize, awarded to writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society.

He lived the last years of his life in Corseaux, on Lake Geneva in Switzerland, near Vevey where Charlie Chaplin was living in at this time. He visited Chaplin often, and the two were good friends. His book &quot;Doctor Fischer of Geneva or the Bomb Party&quot; (1980) is based on themes of combined philosophical and geographical influences. He ceased going to mass and confession in the 1950s, but in his final years began to receive the sacraments again from Father Leopoldo Durán, a Spanish priest, who became a friend.

In one of his final works, a pamphlet titled &quot;J&#x27;Accuse: The Dark Side of Nice&quot; (1982), Greene wrote of a legal matter that embroiled him and his extended family in Nice, and declared that organised crime flourished in Nice because the city&#x27;s upper levels of civic government protected judicial and police corruption. The accusation provoked a libel lawsuit that Greene lost, but he was ultimately vindicated in the 1990s when the former mayor of Nice, Jacques Médecin, was imprisoned for corruption and associated crimes.

In 1984, in celebration of his 80th birthday, the brewery which Greene&#x27;s great-grandfather founded in 1799 made a special edition of its St. Edmund&#x27;s Ale for him, with a special label in his honour. Commenting on turning 80, Greene said, &quot;The big advantage ... is that at 80 you are more likely these days to beat out encountering your end in a nuclear war,&quot; adding, &quot;the other side of the problem is that I really don&#x27;t want to survive myself [which] has nothing to do with nukes, but with the body hanging around while the mind departs.&quot;

In 1986, Greene was awarded Britain&#x27;s Order of Merit. He died of leukaemia in 1991 at the age of 86, and was buried in Corseaux cemetery.

== Writing style and themes ==

Greene originally divided his fiction into two genres: thrillers (mystery and suspense books), such as &quot;The Ministry of Fear&quot;, which he described as entertainments, often with notable philosophic edges; and literary works, such as &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot;, which he described as novels, on which he thought his literary reputation was to be based.

As his career lengthened, both Greene and his readers found the distinction between &quot;entertainments&quot; and &quot;novels&quot; to be less evident. The last book Greene termed an entertainment was &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot; in 1958. When &quot;Travels with My Aunt&quot; was published eleven years later, many reviewers noted that Greene had designated it a novel, even though, as a work decidedly comic in tone, it appeared closer to his last two entertainments, &quot;Loser Takes All&quot; and &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot;, than to any of the novels. Greene, they speculated, seemed to have dropped the category of entertainment. This was soon confirmed. In the &quot;Collected Edition&quot; of Greene&#x27;s works published in 22 volumes between 1970 and 1982, the distinction between novels and entertainments is no longer maintained. All are novels.

Greene was one of the more &quot;cinematic&quot; of twentieth-century writers; most of his novels and many of his plays and short stories have been adapted for film or television. The Internet Movie Database lists 66 titles between 1934 and 2010 based on Greene material. Some novels were filmed more than once, such as &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; in 1947 and 2011, &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; in 1955 and 1999, and &quot;The Quiet American&quot; in 1958 and 2002. The 1936 thriller &quot;A Gun for Sale&quot; was filmed at least five times under different titles, notably &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; in 1942. Greene received an Academy Award nomination for the screenplay for Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot; (1948), adapted from his own short story &quot;The Basement Room&quot;. He also wrote several original screenplays. In 1949, after writing the novella as &quot;raw material&quot;, he wrote the screenplay for a classic film noir, &quot;The Third Man&quot;, also directed by Reed and featuring Orson Welles. In 1983, &quot;The Honorary Consul&quot;, published ten years earlier, was released as a film (under the title &quot;Beyond the Limit&quot; in some territories), starring Michael Caine and Richard Gere. Author and screenwriter Michael Korda contributed a foreword and introduction to this novel in a commemorative edition.

In 2009, &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; began to publish in serial form a newly discovered Greene novel titled &quot;The Empty Chair&quot;. The manuscript was written in longhand when Greene was 22 and newly converted to Catholicism.

Greene&#x27;s literary style was described by Evelyn Waugh in &quot;Commonweal&quot; as &quot;not a specifically literary style at all. The words are functional, devoid of sensuous attraction, of ancestry, and of independent life&quot;. Commenting on the lean prose and its readability, Richard Jones wrote in the &quot;Virginia Quarterly Review&quot; that &quot;nothing deflects Greene from the main business of holding the reader&#x27;s attention&quot;. Greene&#x27;s novels often have religious themes at their centre. In his literary criticism he attacked the modernist writers Virginia Woolf and E. M. Forster for having lost the religious sense which, he argued, resulted in dull, superficial characters, who &quot;wandered about like cardboard symbols through a world that is paper-thin&quot;. Only in recovering the religious element, the awareness of the drama of the struggle in the soul that carries the permanent consequence of salvation or damnation, and of the ultimate metaphysical realities of good and evil, sin and divine grace, could the novel recover its dramatic power. Suffering and unhappiness are omnipresent in the world Greene depicts; and Catholicism is presented against a background of unvarying human evil, sin, and doubt. V. S. Pritchett praised Greene as the first English novelist since Henry James to present, and grapple with, the reality of evil. Greene concentrated on portraying the characters&#x27; internal lives—their mental, emotional, and spiritual depths. His stories are often set in poor, hot and dusty tropical places such as Mexico, West Africa, Vietnam, Cuba, Haiti, and Argentina, which led to the coining of the expression &quot;Greeneland&quot; to describe such settings.

The novels often portray the dramatic struggles of the individual soul from a Catholic perspective. Greene was criticised for certain tendencies in an unorthodox direction—in the world, sin is omnipresent to the degree that the vigilant struggle to avoid sinful conduct is doomed to failure, hence not central to holiness. His friend and fellow Catholic Evelyn Waugh attacked that as a revival of the Quietist heresy. This aspect of his work also was criticised by the theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, as giving sin a mystique. Greene responded that constructing a vision of pure faith and goodness in the novel was beyond his talents. Praise of Greene from an orthodox Catholic point of view by Edward Short is in &quot;Crisis Magazine&quot;, and a mainstream Catholic critique is presented by Joseph Pearce.

Catholicism&#x27;s prominence decreased in his later writings. The supernatural realities that haunted the earlier work declined and were replaced by a humanistic perspective, a change reflected in his public criticism of orthodox Catholic teaching.

In his later years, Greene was a strong critic of American imperialism and sympathised with the Cuban leader Fidel Castro, whom he had met. Years before the Vietnam War, he prophetically attacked the idealistic but arrogant beliefs of &quot;The Quiet American&quot;, whose certainty in his own virtue kept him from seeing the disaster he inflicted on the Vietnamese. In &quot;Ways of Escape&quot;, reflecting on his Mexican trip, he complained that Mexico&#x27;s government was insufficiently left-wing compared with Cuba&#x27;s. In Greene&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Conservatism and Catholicism should be ... impossible bedfellows&quot;.

In May 1949, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; held a contest for parodies of Greene&#x27;s writing style: he himself submitted an entry under the name &quot;N. Wilkinson&quot;, and took second place. Greene&#x27;s entry comprised the first two paragraphs of a novel, apparently set in Italy, &quot;The Stranger&#x27;s Hand: An Entertainment&quot;. Greene&#x27;s friend, the film director Mario Soldati, believed it had the makings of a suspense film about Yugoslav spies in postwar Venice. Upon Soldati&#x27;s prompting, Greene continued writing the story as the basis for a film script. Apparently he lost interest in the project, leaving it as a substantial fragment that was published posthumously in &quot;The Graham Greene Film Reader&quot; (1993) and &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (2005). A script for &quot;The Stranger&#x27;s Hand&quot; was written by Guy Elmes on the basis of Greene&#x27;s unfinished story, and filmed by Soldati. In 1965, Greene again entered a similar &quot;New Statesman&quot; competition pseudonymously, and won an honourable mention.

== Legacy ==

Greene is regarded as a major 20th-century novelist, and was praised by John Irving, prior to Greene&#x27;s death, as &quot;the most accomplished living novelist in the English language&quot;. Novelist Frederick Buechner called Greene&#x27;s novel &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; a &quot;tremendous influence&quot;. By 1943, Greene had acquired the reputation of being the &quot;leading English male novelist of his generation&quot;, and at the time of his death in 1991 had a reputation as a writer of both deeply serious novels on the theme of Catholicism, and of &quot;suspense-filled stories of detection&quot;.

Acclaimed during his lifetime, Greene was shortlisted for the Nobel Prize in Literature several times. In 1961 and 1966 he was among the final three candidates for the prize. In 1967, Greene was again among the final three choices, according to Nobel records unsealed on the 50th anniversary in 2017. The committee also considered Jorge Luis Borges and Miguel Ángel Asturias, with the latter the chosen winner. Greene remained a favourite to win the Nobel prize in the 1980s, but it was known that two influential members of the Swedish Academy, Artur Lundkvist and Lars Gyllensten, opposed the prize for Greene and he was never awarded.

Greene collected several literary awards for his novels, including the 1941 Hawthornden Prize for &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; and the 1948 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;. As an author, he received the 1968 Shakespeare Prize and the 1981 Jerusalem Prize, a biennial literary award given to writers whose works have dealt with themes of human freedom in society. In 1986, he was awarded Britain&#x27;s Order of Merit.

The Graham Greene International Festival is an annual four-day event of conference papers, informal talks, question and answer sessions, films, dramatised readings, music, creative writing workshops and social events. It is organised by the Graham Greene Birthplace Trust, and takes place in the writer&#x27;s home town of Berkhamsted (about 35 miles northwest of London), on dates as close as possible to the anniversary of his birth (2 October). Its purpose is to promote interest in and study of the works of Graham Greene.

He is the subject of the 2013 documentary film, &quot;Dangerous Edge: A Life of Graham Greene&quot;.

His short story &quot;The Destructors&quot; was featured in the 2001 film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;.

<text>Petroleum engineering is a field of engineering concerned with the activities related to the production of hydrocarbons, which can be either crude oil or natural gas. Exploration and production are deemed to fall within the &quot;upstream&quot; sector of the oil and gas industry. Exploration, by earth scientists, and petroleum engineering are the oil and gas industry&#x27;s two main subsurface disciplines, which focus on maximizing economic recovery of hydrocarbons from subsurface reservoirs. Petroleum geology and geophysics focus on provision of a static description of the hydrocarbon reservoir rock, while petroleum engineering focuses on estimation of the recoverable volume of this resource using a detailed understanding of the physical behavior of oil, water and gas within porous rock at very high pressure.

The combined efforts of geologists and petroleum engineers throughout the life of a hydrocarbon accumulation determine the way in which a reservoir is developed and depleted, and usually they have the highest impact on field economics. Petroleum engineering requires a good knowledge of many other related disciplines, such as geophysics, petroleum geology, formation evaluation (well logging), drilling, economics, reservoir simulation, reservoir engineering, well engineering, artificial lift systems, completions and petroleum production engineering.

Recruitment to the industry has historically been from the disciplines of physics, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering and mining engineering. Subsequent development training has usually been done within oil companies.

== Overview ==
The profession got its start in 1914 within the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers (AIME). The first Petroleum Engineering degree was conferred in 1915 by the University of Pittsburgh. Since then, the profession has evolved to solve increasingly difficult situations. Improvements in computer modeling, materials and the application of statistics, probability analysis, and new technologies like horizontal drilling and enhanced oil recovery, have drastically improved the toolbox of the petroleum engineer in recent decades. Automation, sensors, and robots are being used to propel the industry to more efficiency and safety.

Deep-water, arctic and desert conditions are usually contended with. High temperature and high pressure (HTHP) environments have become increasingly commonplace in operations and require the petroleum engineer to be savvy in topics as wide-ranging as thermo-hydraulics, geomechanics, and intelligent systems.

The Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) is the largest professional society for petroleum engineers and publishes much technical information and other resources to support the oil and gas industry. It provides free online education (webinars), mentoring, and access to SPE Connect, an exclusive platform for members to discuss technical issues, best practices, and other topics. SPE members also are able to access the SPE Competency Management Tool to find knowledge and skill strengths and opportunities for growth. SPE publishes peer-reviewed journals, books, and magazines. SPE members receive a complimentary subscription to the &quot;Journal of Petroleum Technology&quot; and discounts on SPE&#x27;s other publications. SPE members also receive discounts on registration fees for SPE organized events and training courses. SPE provides scholarships and fellowships to undergraduate and graduate students.

According to the United States Department of Labor&#x27;s Bureau of Labor Statistics, petroleum engineers are required to have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering, generally a degree focused on petroleum engineering is preferred, but degrees in mechanical, chemical, and civil engineering are satisfactory as well. Petroleum engineering education is available at many universities in the United States and throughout the world - primarily in oil producing regions. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; maintains a list of the Best Undergraduate Petroleum Engineering Programs. SPE and some private companies offer training courses. Some oil companies have considerable in-house petroleum engineering training classes.

=== Petroleum engineering salaries ===
Petroleum engineering has historically been one of the highest-paid engineering disciplines, although there is a tendency for mass layoffs when oil prices decline and waves of hiring as prices rise. In 2020, the United States Department of Labor&#x27;s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the median pay for petroleum engineers was US$137,330, or roughly $66.02 per hour. The same summary projects there will be 3% job growth in this field from 2019 to 2029.

SPE annually conducts a salary survey. In 2017, SPE reported that the average SPE professional member reported earning US$194,649 (including salary and bonus). The average base pay reported in 2016 was $143,006. Base pay and other compensation was on average was highest in the United States where the base pay was US$174,283. Drilling and production engineers tended to make the best base pay, US$160,026 for drilling engineers and US$158,964 for production engineers. Average base pay ranged from US$96,382-174,283. There are still significant gender pay gaps, plus or minus 5% of the US average pay gap which was 18% difference in 2017.

Also in 2016, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; named petroleum engineering the top college major in terms of highest median annual wages of college-educated workers (age 25–59). The 2010 National Association of Colleges and Employers survey showed petroleum engineers as the highest paid 2010 graduates, at an average annual salary of $125,220. For individuals with experience, salaries can range from $170,000 to $260,000. They make an average of $112,000 a year and about $53.75 per hour. In a 2007 article, Forbes.com reported that petroleum engineering was the 24th best paying job in the United States.

== Sub-disciplines ==
Petroleum engineers divide themselves into several types:
* Reservoir engineers work to optimize production of oil and gas via proper placement, production rates, and enhanced oil recovery techniques.
* Drilling engineers manage the technical aspects of drilling exploratory, production and injection wells.
* Drilling fluid engineers A mud engineer (correctly called a Drilling Fluids Engineer, but most often referred to as the &quot;Mud Man&quot;) works on an oil well or gas well drilling rig, and is responsible ensuring the properties of the drilling fluid, also known as drilling mud, are within designed specifications.
* Completion engineers (also known as subsurface engineers) work to design and oversee the implementation of techniques aimed at ensuring wells are drilled stably and with the maximum opportunity for oil and gas production. 
* Production engineers manage the interface between the reservoir and the well, including perforations, sand control, downhole flow control, and downhole monitoring equipment; evaluate artificial lift methods; and select surface equipment that separates the produced fluids (oil, natural gas, and water).
* Petrophysicists gather information about subsurface properties to build wellbore stability models and study rock properties

== Education ==
Petroleum Engineering, like most forms of engineering, requires a strong foundation in physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Other fields pertinent to petroleum engineering include geology, formation evaluation, fluid flow in porous media, well drilling technology, economics, geostatistics, etc.

=== Petroleum Geostatistics ===
Geostatistics as applied to petroleum engineering uses statistical analysis to characterize reservoirs and create flow simulations that quantify uncertainties of the location of oil and gas.

=== Petroleum Geology ===
Petroleum geology is an interdisciplinary field composed of geophysics, geochemistry, and paleontology. The main focus of petroleum geology is the exploration and appraisal of reservoirs containing hydrocarbons via technical forms of analysis.

=== Well Drilling Technology ===
Well drilling technology is primarily the focus for drilling engineers. The two forms of well drilling are percussion and rotary drilling, rotary being the most common of the two. An important aspect of drilling is the drill bit, which creates a borehole of approximately three and a half to thirty inches in diameter. The three classes of drill bits, roller cone, fixed cutter, and hybrid, each use teeth to break up the rock. To optimize drilling efficiency and cost, drilling engineers make use of drilling simulators that allow them to identify drilling conditions. Drilling technologies including horizontal drilling and directional drilling have been developed to obtain hydrocarbons profitably from impermeable and coal-bed methane accumulations.

<doc id="65466" wikidata="Q4446039" url="?curid=65466" title="Tigger">
<text>Tigger is a fictional character in A. A. Milne&#x27;s Winnie-the-Pooh books and their adaptations. An anthropomorphic toy tiger, he was originally introduced in the 1928-story collection &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;, the sequel to the 1926 book &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;. Like other Pooh characters, Tigger is based on one of Christopher Robin Milne&#x27;s stuffed toy animals. He appears in the Disney animated versions of &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; and has also appeared in his own film, &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; (2000).

He is known for his distinctive orange colour with black stripes, large eyes, a long chin, a springy tail, and his love of bouncing. As he says himself, &quot;Bouncing is what Tiggers do best.&quot; Tigger never refers to himself as a tiger, but as a &quot;Tigger&quot;. Although he often refers to himself in the third person plural (e.g. &quot;Tiggers don&#x27;t like honey!&quot;), he maintains that he is &quot;the only one&quot;.

==In literature==
 Tigger is introduced in Chapter II of &quot;House at Pooh Corner&quot;, when he arrives at Winnie-the-Pooh&#x27;s doorstep in the middle of the night, announcing himself with a stylised roar. Most of the rest of that chapter is taken up with the characters&#x27; search for a food that Tigger can eat for breakfast — despite Tigger&#x27;s claims to like &quot;everything&quot;, it is quickly proven he does not like honey, acorns, thistles, or most of the contents of Kanga&#x27;s larder. In a happy coincidence, however, he discovers what Tiggers &quot;really&quot; like best is extract of malt, which Kanga has on hand because she gives it to her baby, Roo, as &quot;strengthening medicine&quot;.

Subsequently, Tigger resides with Kanga and Roo in their house in the part of the Hundred Acre Wood near the Sandy Pit. He becomes great friends with Roo (to whom he becomes a sort of older sibling figure), and Kanga treats him in much the same way she does her own son. Tigger also interacts enthusiastically with all the other characters — sometimes too enthusiastically for the likes of Rabbit, who is sometimes exasperated by Tigger&#x27;s constant bouncing, Eeyore, who is once bounced into the river by Tigger, and Piglet, who always seems a little nervous about the new, large, bouncy animal in the Forest. Nonetheless, the animals are all shown to be friends.

In addition to chapter II, Tigger also appears in Chapters IV, VI, VII, IX, and X of &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;, and is mentioned and seen in Chapter V. He is the only new major character to be introduced in &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;; all of the others had been established in the earlier book, &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;.

===Depiction and personality traits===
In Ernest H. Shepard&#x27;s illustrations, Tigger appears to bounce and he is capable of holding a pen with one of his front paws. Though Tigger is described by Rabbit and Piglet as &quot;large&quot;, he does not seem particularly big in the illustrations. Pooh states once &quot;He always seems bigger because of his bounces&quot;, implying that the other animals think of Tigger as being larger than he truly is. That assessment fits very well with Tigger&#x27;s personality and his assessment of his own abilities, which he always overestimates. He is cheerful, outgoing, competitive in a friendly way, and has complete confidence in himself. Some of the things which he claims Tiggers can do in the chapter &quot;In which it is shown That Tiggers don&#x27;t climb trees&quot; include flying, jumping farther than a kangaroo, swimming, and climbing trees. He never actually attempts any of the first three things in the course of the story, but he does try to climb a tree. He only succeeds half-way, being able to climb up but not to climb down again. Tigger also says Tiggers &quot;never get lost&quot;; unlike most of his other claims, this one seems to be true - he is able to find his way through the Forest even in a thick mist, despite Rabbit&#x27;s attempts to lose him.

Like most of the characters in Winnie-the-Pooh, Tigger was based on one of Christopher Robin Milne&#x27;s stuffed animals, in this case a stuffed-toy tiger. However, the word &quot;tiger&quot; is never actually used in the book. The term &quot;Tigger&quot; is used instead, both as the character&#x27;s name and as a description of his type of animal. No other &quot;Tiggers&quot; appear in the story, and at one point Tigger (who has just seen his reflection in a mirror and mistaken it for another individual) comments he thought he was the only one. Despite that belief, he constantly uses the term in the plural, as in &quot;Tiggers don&#x27;t like honey.&quot; and &quot;So &quot;that&#x27;s&quot; what Tiggers like!&quot;, etc. The term is always capitalized.

==Adaptations==
In 1960, His Master&#x27;s Voice recorded a dramatised version with songs (music by Harold Fraser-Simson) of two episodes from &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; (Chapters 2 and 8), with Hugh Lloyd as Tigger, which was released on a 45 rpm EP.

==Disney adaptations==

Tigger appears in the Disney cartoon versions of the Winnie the Pooh stories, beginning with &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; in 1968. He starred in his own film, &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; (Disney, 2000), along with his friends from the Hundred Acre Wood.

From 1968 to 1999, Tigger was voiced by Paul Winchell. However, Walt Disney initially planned to have the character voiced by Wally Boag, but the role was turned over to Winchell after Disney&#x27;s death, since Boag&#x27;s performance of the character was considered to be &quot;too zany for a children&#x27;s film&quot;. Sam Edwards voiced Tigger in a couple of albums for Disneyland Records before &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; was released. Will Ryan voiced Tigger only in the Disney Channel program &quot;Welcome to Pooh Corner&quot;, which ran from 1983 to 1986. Later, Jim Cummings (who is also the new voice of Pooh) provided Tigger&#x27;s voice, starting with later seasons of &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;. For a while, Cummings shared the role with Winchell, with the latter providing Tigger&#x27;s speaking voice while the former sang as the character, until he took the role full-time starting with the 2000 film &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;.

Since 1989, Tigger has been voiced by Jim Cummings (also the voice of Winnie the Pooh), with the exceptions of &quot;What&#x27;s the Score, Pooh?&quot; (1990), &quot;Eeyi Eeyi Eeyore&quot; (1990), &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin&quot; (1997), &quot;A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving&quot; (1998), &quot;Winnie the Pooh: A Valentine for You&quot; (1999), archive footage of &quot;Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving&quot; (1999), and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh attraction at Walt Disney World, in which Winchell reprised the role of Tigger (Cummings voiced Tigger in the Disneyland version). On some albums and read-along cassettes in the early &#x27;90s, Ed Gilbert voiced Tigger.

In the movies, Tigger sings his own theme song, &quot;The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers&quot;, written by the Sherman Brothers and first sung in Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day. The song is repeated in Disney&#x27;s 1974 release &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!&quot;, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride and then again in the 1977 release &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;. In 1974, Paul Winchell earned a Grammy for his rendition of the song. The music was composed by Richard M. Sherman, with the lyrics and idea by Robert B. Sherman. Performed by Sam Edwards on record albums and Paul Winchell in &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; and later Jim Cummings in &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;, &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot;, the 2011 film &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;, and the 2018 live-action film &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;. According to the song, Tigger is &quot;the only one&quot;, which leads to his search for his family in &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;. The song opens up that film&#x27;s first release.

In &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; and subsequent cartoons, Tigger lives in a large treehouse. A tire swing hangs prominently from a branch of the tree. In &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;, Tigger builds a makeshift addition (gluing the shingles on with bubble gum, using honey as brick mortar) in anticipation of a hoped-for visit by members of his family. This &quot;family room&quot; is eventually relocated to serve as a replacement for Eeyore&#x27;s collapse-prone house of sticks.

The Disney version of Tigger appeared in both the TV special &quot;Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue&quot; and the TV series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. Tigger also made recurring appearances in the live-action wrap-around skits television series &quot;The Mouse Factory&quot;, alongside the other costumed characters and celebrity guests.

===Personality traits===
Tigger&#x27;s personality in the cartoons is much like his personality in the book. He is always filled with great energy and optimism, and though always well-meaning, he can also be mischievous, and his actions have sometimes led to chaos and trouble for himself and his friends. He is very confident and possesses high self-esteem to the point of egotism. Also, he often undertakes tasks with gusto, only to later realize they were not as easy as he had originally imagined. As in the books, Tigger never refers to himself as a tiger, but as a &quot;Tigger&quot;. When Tigger introduces himself, he often says the proper way to spell his name and that is &quot;T-I-double-Guh-Er&quot;, which spells &quot;Tigger&quot;.

Tigger&#x27;s language is full of malapropisms, mispronunciations, or unnecessary/incorrect emphasis on syllables. Examples of this include him pronouncing &quot;villain&quot; as &quot;villian&quot;; &quot;terrible&quot; as &quot;terribibble&quot;; &quot;regulations&quot; as &quot;regularations&quot;; &quot;ridiculous&quot; as &quot;ridickerous&quot; (or &quot;ricky-diculus&quot; in &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot;); &quot;allergic&quot; as &quot;allergical&quot;; &quot;recognize&quot; as &quot;recoganize&quot;; &quot;suspicious&quot; as &quot;suspicerous&quot;; &quot;Eureka&quot; as &quot;Topeka&quot;.

A declaration often made, is that &quot;Tiggers are wonderful things. Their tops are made out of rubber, their bottoms are made out of springs.&quot; In cartoon, he&#x27;s often depicted bouncing around in ways which would make such a statement appear to be valid.

In &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, Tigger is often well-meaning but usually does more harm than good. In the episode &quot;Tigger is the Mother of Invention&quot;, he invented a bulldozer-like contraption intended to provide convenience for Pooh, Piglet, and Rabbit, but the invention proved to have disastrous results, and Rabbit insisted that Tigger shut it down; however, in the winter, a depressed Tigger accidentally started the machine up, and it proved to be useful by plowing snow around Piglet&#x27;s house before malfunctioning. On another occasion, Tigger attempted to mimic a superhero, &quot;The Masked Offender&quot;, bringing mayhem to the Hundred-Acre Wood. In response, Pooh, Rabbit, Gopher, and Owl (unaware that the Masked Offender was actually Tigger) staged a hoax in which they made an monster from a sticky glue-like material. The plan worked, revealing Tigger as the Masked Offender, but the fake monster (which was on wheels) turned on its makers, ultimately resulting in Pooh, Rabbit, Gopher, and Owl hanging by the glue from a rickety bridge. Subsequently, Tigger resumed his role as the Masked Offender, and saved his friends.

It&#x27;s also shown that Tigger will jump in to help without thinking about the danger to himself. On at least three occasions, he has nearly fallen off a cliff, and &quot;has&quot; fallen two of those times, to retrieve something important (Half of the map in &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin&quot;, his locket in &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;, and a page of Piglet&#x27;s scrapbook in &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot;).

Tigger&#x27;s birthday is believed to be in October 1928, the year &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; was first published. However, on Tigger-related merchandise, Disney often indicates Tigger&#x27;s birthyear is in December 1968, a reference to the first appearance of Tigger in a Disney production, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot;.

Disney&#x27;s Tigger is also remembered for his song &quot;The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers&quot; when he made his first appearance. However, he wasn&#x27;t included in the &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; theme song until the 2011 film.

<text>Persi Warren Diaconis (; born January 31, 1945) is an American mathematician of Greek descent and former professional magician. He is the Mary V. Sunseri Professor of Statistics and Mathematics at Stanford University.

He is particularly known for tackling mathematical problems involving randomness and randomization, such as coin flipping and shuffling playing cards.

==Biography==
Diaconis left home at 14 to travel with sleight-of-hand legend Dai Vernon, and was awarded a high school diploma based on grades given to him by his teachers after dropping out of George Washington High School. He returned to school at age 24 to learn math, motivated to read William Feller&#x27;s famous two-volume treatise on probability theory, &quot;An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications&quot;. He attended the City College of New York for his undergraduate work, graduating in 1971, and then obtained a Ph.D. in Mathematical Statistics from Harvard University in 1974, learned to read Feller, and became a mathematical probabilist.

According to Martin Gardner, at school, Diaconis supported himself by playing poker on ships between New York and South America. Gardner recalls that Diaconis had &quot;fantastic second deal and bottom deal&quot;.

Diaconis is married to Stanford statistics professor Susan Holmes.

==Career==
Diaconis received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1982. In 1990, he published (with Dave Bayer) a paper entitled &quot;Trailing the Dovetail Shuffle to Its Lair&quot; (a term coined by magician Charles Jordan in the early 1900s) which established rigorous results on how many times a deck of playing cards must be riffle shuffled before it can be considered random according to the mathematical measure total variation distance. Diaconis is often cited for the simplified proposition that it takes seven shuffles to randomize a deck. More precisely, Diaconis showed that, in the Gilbert–Shannon–Reeds model of how likely it is that a riffle results in a particular riffle shuffle permutation, it takes 5 riffles before the total variation distance of a 52-card deck begins to drop significantly from the maximum value of 1.0, and 7 riffles before it drops below 0.5 very quickly (a threshold phenomenon), after which it is reduced by a factor of 2 every shuffle. When entropy is viewed as the probabilistic distance, riffle shuffling seems to take less time to mix, and the threshold phenomenon goes away (because the entropy function is subadditive).

Diaconis has coauthored several more recent papers expanding on his 1992 results and relating the problem of shuffling cards to other problems in mathematics. Among other things, they showed that the separation distance of an ordered blackjack deck (that is, aces on top, followed by 2&#x27;s, followed by 3&#x27;s, etc.) drops below .5 after 7 shuffles. Separation distance is an upper bound for variation distance.

Diaconis has been hired by casino executives to search for subtle flaws in their automatic card shuffling machines. Diaconis soon found some and the horrified executives responded, &quot;We are not pleased with your conclusions but we believe them and that&#x27;s what we hired you for.&quot;

He served on the Mathematical Sciences jury of the Infosys Prize in 2011 and 2012.

<text>George Howard Brett (born May 15, 1953) is an American former professional baseball third baseman, designated hitter, and first baseman who played 21 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City Royals.

Brett&#x27;s 3,154 career hits are second most by any third baseman in major league history (after only Adrián Beltré&#x27;s 3,166) and rank 18th all-time. He is one of five players in MLB history to accumulate 3,000 hits, 300 home runs, and a career .300 batting average (the others being Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Miguel Cabrera, and Stan Musial). He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999 in his first year of eligibility, and is the only player in MLB history to win a batting title in three different decades. He was also a member of the Royals&#x27; 1985 World Series victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.

Brett was named the Royals&#x27; interim hitting coach in 2013 on May 30, but he stepped down from the position on July 25 in order to resume his position of vice president of baseball operations. In 2015 he won his second World Series ring, when the Royals&#x27; won the series in 5 games over the New York Mets.

==Early life==
Brett was born in Glen Dale, West Virginia, the youngest of four sons of a sports-minded family. Ken, the second oldest, became a major league pitcher who pitched in the 1967 World Series at age 19. Brothers John (eldest) and Bobby had brief careers in the minor leagues. All George’s brothers were born in Brooklyn.

Jack and Ethel Brett then moved the family from the northern panhandle of West Virginia to the Midwest, and three years later to El Segundo, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, just south of Los Angeles International Airport. George grew up hoping to follow in the footsteps of his older brothers. He graduated from El Segundo High School in 1971 and was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the second round (29th overall) of the 1971 Major League Baseball draft. He was high school teammates with pitcher Scott McGregor.

==Playing career==

===Minor leagues===
Brett began his professional baseball career as a shortstop, but had trouble going to his right defensively and was soon shifted to third base. As a third baseman, his powerful arm remained an asset, and he remained at that spot for more than 15 years. Brett&#x27;s minor league stops were with the Billings Mustangs for the Rookie-level Pioneer League in 1971, the San Jose Bees of the Class A California League in 1972, and the Omaha Royals of the Class AAA American Association in 1973, batting .291, .274, and .284, respectively.

===Kansas City Royals (1973–1993)===

====1973====
The Royals promoted Brett to the major leagues on August 2, 1973. He made his major league debut that day against the Chicago White Sox, going 1-for-4 as the starting third baseman. He played in 13 games, and hit .125 (5-for-40).

====1974====
Brett won the starting third base job in 1974, but struggled at the plate until he asked for help from Charley Lau, the Royals&#x27; batting coach. Spending the All-Star break working together, Lau taught Brett how to protect the entire plate and cover up some holes in his swing that experienced big-league pitchers were exploiting. Armed with this knowledge, Brett developed rapidly as a hitter, and finished the year with a .282 batting average, two home runs and 47 RBI in 113 games.

====1975–1979====
Brett topped the .300 mark for the first time in 1975, hitting .308 with 11 home runs and 90 RBI in 159 games. He finished the season leading the league in hits (195) and triples (13). He then won his first batting title in 1976 with a .333 average, seven home runs and 67 RBI in 159 games. The four contenders for the batting title that year were Brett and Royals teammate Hal McRae, and Minnesota Twins teammates Rod Carew and Lyman Bostock. In dramatic fashion, Brett went 2-for-4 in the final game of the season against the Twins, beating out his three rivals, all playing in the same game. His lead over second-place McRae was less than .001. Brett won the title when a fly ball dropped in front of Twins left fielder Steve Brye, bounced on the Royals Stadium AstroTurf and over Brye&#x27;s head to the wall; Brett circled the bases for an inside-the-park home run. McRae, batting just behind Brett in the line up, grounded out and Brett won his first batting title.

From May 8 through May 13, 1976, Brett had three or more hits in six consecutive games, a major league record. A month later, he was on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; for a feature article, and made his first of 13 All-Star teams. The Royals won the first of three straight American League West Division titles, beginning a great rivalry with the New York Yankees—whom they faced in the American League Championship Series each of those three years. In the fifth and final game of the 1976 ALCS, Brett hit a three-run homer in the top of the eighth inning to tie the score at six—only to see the Yankees&#x27; Chris Chambliss launch a solo shot in the bottom of the ninth to give the Yankees a 7–6 win. Brett finished second in American League MVP voting to Thurman Munson.
A year later, Brett emerged as a power hitter, batting .312 while clubbing 22 home runs and recording 88 RBI in 139 games, as the Royals headed to another ALCS. In Game 5 of the 1977 ALCS, following an RBI triple, Brett slid into third and was called safe then was kicked in the head by Graig Nettles, after which Brett stood and threw a punch at Nettles, igniting a bench-clearing brawl.

In , Brett batted .294 (the only time between 1976 and in which he did not bat at least .300) with nine home runs and 62 RBI in 128 games, helping the Royals win a third consecutive AL West title. However, Kansas City once again lost to the Yankees in the ALCS, but not before Brett hit three home runs off Catfish Hunter in Game 3, becoming the second player to hit three home runs in an LCS game (Bob Robertson was the first, having done so in Game 2 of the 1971 NLCS).

Brett followed with a successful 1979 season, in which he finished third in AL MVP voting. He became the sixth player in league history to have at least 20 doubles, triples and homers all in one season (42–20–23) and led the league in hits (212) and triples (20) while batting .329, with an on-base percentage of .376 and a slugging percentage of .563.

====1980====
All these impressive statistics were just a prelude to , when Brett won the American League MVP and batted .390, a modern record for a third baseman. Brett&#x27;s batting average was at or above .400 as late in the season as September 19, and the country closely followed his quest to bat .400 for an entire season, a feat which has not been accomplished since Ted Williams in .

Brett&#x27;s 1980 batting average of .390 is second only to Tony Gwynn&#x27;s average of .394 (Gwynn played in 110 games and had 419 at-bats in the strike-shortened season, compared to Brett&#x27;s 449 at bats in 1980) for the highest single season batting average since 1941. Brett also recorded 118 runs batted in, while appearing in just 117 games; it was the first instance of a player averaging one RBI per game (in more than 100 games) since Walt Dropo thirty seasons prior. He led the American League in both slugging and on-base percentage.

Brett started out slowly, hitting only .259 in April. In May, he hit .329 to get his season average to .301. In June, the 27-year-old third baseman hit .472 (17-for-36) to raise his season average to .337, but played his last game for a month on June 10, not returning to the lineup until after the All-Star Break on July 10 due to him tearing a ligament in his foot while trying to steal second.

In July, after being off for a month, he played in 21 games and hit .494 (42-for-85), raising his season average to .390. Brett started a 30-game hitting streak on July 18, which lasted until he went 0-for-3 on August 19 (the following night he went 3-for-3). During those 30 games, Brett hit .467 (57-for-122). His high mark for the season came a week later, when Brett&#x27;s batting average was at .407 on August 26, after he went 5-for-5 on a Tuesday night in Milwaukee. He batted .430 for the month of August (30 games), and his season average was at .403 with five weeks to go. For the three hot months of June, July, and August 1980, Brett played in 60 American League games and hit .459 (111-for-242), most of it after a return from a monthlong injury. For these 60 games, he had 14 home runs and 69 RBI.

Brett missed another 10 days in early September and hit just .290 for the month. His average was at .400 as late as September 19, but he then had a 4-for-27 slump, and the average dipped to .384 on September 27, with a week to play. For the final week, Brett went 10-for-19, which included going 2-for-4 in the final regular season game on October 4. His season average ended up at .390 (175 hits in 449 at-bats = .389755), and he averaged more than one RBI per game. Brett led the league in both on-base percentage (.454) and slugging percentage (.664) on his way to capturing 17 of 28 possible first-place votes in the MVP race. Since Al Simmons also batted .390 in 1931 for the Philadelphia Athletics, the only higher averages subsequent to 1931 were by Ted Williams of the Red Sox (.406 in 1941) and Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres (.394 in the strike-shortened 1994 season).

More importantly, the Royals won the American League West, and would face the AL East champion New York Yankees in the ALCS.

====1980 postseason====
During the 1980 post-season, Brett led the Royals to their first American League pennant, sweeping the playoffs in three games from the rival Yankees who had beaten K.C. in the 1976, 1977 and 1978 playoffs. During Game 2 of the 1980 ALCS, Willie Randolph was on first base in the top of the eighth with two outs and the Royals up by just one run. Bob Watson hit a ball to the left field corner of Royals Stadium. The ball bounced right to Willie Wilson, but Wilson was not known for having a great arm, and third base coach Mike Ferraro waved Randolph home. Wilson overthrew U L Washington, the cut-off man, but Brett was in position behind him to catch the ball, then throw to Darrell Porter, who tagged out Randolph in a slide. TV cameras captured a furious George Steinbrenner fuming immediately after the play. The Royals won 3–2. Brett claimed after the game that he had deliberately positioned himself to cut off the throw in case Washington missed it, but Tommy John of the Yankees disagreed, thinking that if Brett had been backing up Washington, he would have been between shortstop and home plate, not over behind third base. Either way, he was in the perfect position to throw out Randolph. In Game 3, Brett hit a ball well into the third deck of Yankee Stadium off Yankees closer Goose Gossage. Gossage&#x27;s previous pitch had been timed at 97 mph, leading ABC broadcaster Jim Palmer to say, &quot;I doubt if he threw that ball 97 miles an hour.&quot; A moment later Palmer was given the actual reading of 98. &quot;Well, I said it wasn&#x27;t 97&quot;, Palmer replied. Brett then hit .375 in the 1980 World Series, but the Royals lost in six games to the Philadelphia Phillies. During the Series, Brett made headlines after leaving Game 2 in the sixth inning due to hemorrhoid pain. Brett had minor surgery the next day, and in Game 3 returned to hit a home run as the Royals won in 10 innings 4–3. After the game, Brett was famously quoted &quot;...my problems are all behind me&quot;. In 1981, he missed two weeks of spring training to have his hemorrhoids removed.

====1981====
On May 14, 1981, Brett hit UPI photographer Tom Gralish in the head with a crutch while Gralish was photographing him after a loss at Royals Stadium. Brett apologized the following day. Roughly two weeks later, in a fit of anger, he destroyed two toilets and a sink at Metropolitan Stadium as reported by sportswriter Mike Fish. On September 15 at a hotel in Anaheim, Brett confronted Fish about his reporting. Brett pushed reporter Janis Carr and had to be restrained by teammates Willie Wilson and Greg Keatley. Police were called but no arrests were made.

====Pine Tar Incident====
On July 24, 1983, in a game against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium, Brett hit a two-run homer off Goose Gossage in the top of the ninth inning with two out to put the Royals up 5–4. After the home run, Yankees manager Billy Martin cited to the umpires a rule stating that any foreign substance on a bat could extend no further than 18 inches from the knob. The umpires measured the amount of pine tar, a legal substance used by hitters to improve their grip, on Brett&#x27;s bat. The pine tar extended about 24 inches, leading home plate umpire Tim McClelland to signal Brett out and end the game as a Yankees win. An enraged Brett charged out of the dugout directly toward McClelland, forcing the two umpires and Royals manager Dick Howser to physically restrain him.

The Royals quickly issued a challenge to the outcome. It was upheld by American League president Lee MacPhail, who ruled that while the bat should have been excluded from future use, the home run should not have been nullified. Amid much controversy, the game was resumed on August 18, 1983, from the point of Brett&#x27;s home run and ended with a Royals win.

====1985====

In 1985, Brett had another brilliant season in which he helped propel the Royals to their second American League Championship. He batted .335 with 30 home runs and 112 RBI in 155 games, finishing in the top 10 of the league in 10 different offensive categories. Defensively, he won his only Gold Glove, which broke Buddy Bell&#x27;s six-year run of the award, and finished second in American League MVP voting to Don Mattingly. In the final week of the regular season, he went 9-for-20 at the plate with seven runs, five homers, and 9 RBI in six crucial games, five of them victories, as the Royals closed the gap and won the division title at the end. He was MVP of the 1985 playoffs against the Toronto Blue Jays, with an incredible Game 3. With KC down in the series two games to none, Brett went 4-for-4, homering in his first two at bats against Doyle Alexander, and doubled to the same spot in right field in his third at bat, leading the Royals&#x27; comeback. Brett then batted .370 in the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, including a four-hit performance in Game 7. The Royals again rallied from a 3–1 deficit to become World Series champions for the first time in their history.

====1986–1993====
In 1988, Brett moved across the diamond to first base in an effort to reduce his chances of injury and had another top-notch season with a .306 average, 24 home runs and 103 RBI in 157 games. But after batting just .282 with 12 homers and 80 RBI in 124 games the next year, it looked like his career might be slowing down. He got off to a terrible start in 1990 and at one point even considered retirement. But his manager, former teammate John Wathan, encouraged him to stick it out. Finally, in July, the slump ended and Brett batted .386 for the rest of the season. In September, he caught Rickey Henderson for the league lead, and in a battle down to the last day of the season, captured his third batting title with a .329 mark. This feat made Brett the only major league player to win batting titles in three different decades.

Brett played three more seasons for the Royals, mostly as their designated hitter, but occasionally filling in for injured teammates at first base. He passed the 3,000-hit mark in 1992, though he was picked off by Angels first baseman Gary Gaetti after stepping off the base to start enjoying the moment. Brett retired after the 1993 season; in his final at-bat, he hit a single up the middle against Rangers closer Tom Henke and scored on a home run by now teammate Gaetti. His last game was also notable as being the final game ever played at Arlington Stadium.

==Hall of Fame==

Brett was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1999, with what was then the fourth-highest voting percentage in baseball history (98.2%), trailing only Tom Seaver, Nolan Ryan, and Ty Cobb. His voting percentage was higher than all-time greats Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Stan Musial, Ted Williams, and Joe DiMaggio. In 2007, Cal Ripken Jr. passed Brett with 98.5% of the vote.

Brett&#x27;s No. 5 was retired by the Royals on May 14, 1994, only the second in Royals history, after former Royals manager, Dick Howser’s No. 10 in 1987.

Brett was selected the Hometown Hero for the Royals in a two-month fan vote revealed in an hour-long telecast on ESPN on September 27, 2006. He was one of the few players to receive more than 400,000 votes.

==Legacy==

Brett&#x27;s 3,154 career hits are the second most by a third baseman in major league history, surpassed only by Adrián Beltré (3,166 hits), and 18th among all players. Baseball historian Bill James regards him as the second-best third baseman of all time, trailing only his contemporary, Mike Schmidt. In 1999, he ranked Number 55 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Brett is one of only five players in MLB history—the other four being Stan Musial, Willie Mays, Miguel Cabrera, and Hank Aaron—to accumulate 3,000 hits, 300 home runs, and a career .300 batting average. Most indicative of his hitting style, Brett is seventh on the career doubles list with 665, trailing only Tris Speaker, Pete Rose, Stan Musial, Ty Cobb, Albert Pujols and Craig Biggio).

Brett was an highly effective hitter in the postseason. In 43 postseason games, including 2 World Series (1980, 1985), he batted .337 (56-for-166) with 10 home runs and 23 RBI.

A photo in the July 1976 edition of &quot;National Geographic&quot; showing Brett signing baseballs for fans with his team&#x27;s name emblazoned across his shirt was the inspiration for New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde&#x27;s 2013 song &quot;Royals,&quot; which won the 2014 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. Brett was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 1994. Brett was inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2017.

==The Mendoza Line==
Brett is credited with popularizing the phrase the Mendoza Line, which is used to represent a sub-.200 batting average, historically regarded as unacceptable at the Major League level. It derives from shortstop Mario Mendoza, a career .215 hitter who finished below .200 five times in his nine seasons in the big leagues—including .198 the year the term is claimed to have been coined by a pair of his teammates in Tom Paciorek and Bruce Bochte in 1979.

Brett referred to the Mendoza Line in an interview, which was picked up by ESPN baseball anchor Chris Berman and then expanded into the world of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

==Post-baseball activities==

Following his playing career Brett became a vice president of the Royals, and has worked as a part-time coach, as a special instructor in spring training, as an interim batting coach, and as a roving instructor helping minor league prospects develop. He also runs a baseball equipment and glove company named Brett Bros. with brothers Bobby, and, until his death in 2003, Ken. He has also lent his name to a restaurant on the Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, Missouri.

In 1998, Brett worked as a color analyst on regional &quot;Fox Saturday Baseball&quot; telecasts.

Brett has continued to raise money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. Brett started to raise money for the Keith Worthington Chapter during his playing career in the mid-1980s.

Brett and his dog Charlie appeared in a PETA ad campaign, encouraging people not to leave their canine companions in the car during hot weather. He also threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Mike Napoli at the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.

On May 30, 2013, the Royals announced that Brett and Pedro Grifol would serve as batting coaches for the organization. On July 25, 2013 (the day following the 30th anniversary of the pine tar incident, the Royals announced that Brett would serve as vice president of baseball operations.

In 2015, Brett was the National Baseball Hall of Fame recipient of the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award for his support of current and former service members of the United States Military.

Brett appeared as himself in the ABC sitcom &quot;Modern Family&quot; on March 28, 2018, alongside main cast member Eric Stonestreet, a Kansas City native and Royals fan, whose character on the show is also an avid fan.

Brett appeared as himself in the &quot;Brockmire&quot; episode &quot;Player to Be Named Later&quot;, in which he is dating Jules (Amanda Peet), much to Brockmire&#x27;s despair; in the episode &quot;Low and Away&quot;, Jules informs Brockmire that she and her now-husband Brett are getting a divorce. Series creator Joel Church-Cooper said in a statement, &quot;When I created a show about a fake Kansas City legend, Jim Brockmire, I thought it only appropriate to have him worship the biggest Kansas City legend of them all—George Brett.&quot;

He is also a recurring guest on the podcast &quot;Pardon My Take&quot; which is presented by Barstool Sports.

===Team ownership===
In 1998, an investor group headed by Brett and his older brother, Bobby, made an unsuccessful bid to purchase the Kansas City Royals. Brett is the principal owner of the Tri-City Dust Devils, the Single-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels. He and his brother Bobby also co-own the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, a Los Angeles Dodgers Single-A partner, and lead ownership groups that control the Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League, and the West Coast League&#x27;s Bellingham Bells.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Brett married the former Leslie Davenport, and they reside in the Kansas City suburb of Mission Hills, Kansas. The couple has three children: Jackson (named after George&#x27;s father), Dylan (named after Bob Dylan), and Robin (named after fellow Hall of Famer Robin Yount of the Milwaukee Brewers).

<text>WABC-TV (channel 7) is a television station in New York City, serving as the flagship of the ABC network. Owned and operated by the network&#x27;s ABC Owned Television Stations division, WABC-TV maintains studios in the Hudson Square neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, co-located with ABC&#x27;s corporate headquarters. The station transmits from atop the Empire State Building.

WABC-TV is best known in broadcasting circles for its version of the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format and for its morning show, syndicated nationally by corporate cousin Disney Media &amp; Entertainment Distribution.

==History==
===As WJZ-TV (1948–1953)===
The station signed on August 10, 1948, as WJZ-TV, the first of three television stations signed on by ABC during that same year, with WENR-TV in Chicago and WXYZ-TV in Detroit being the other two. Channel 7&#x27;s call letters came from its then-sister radio station, WJZ. In its early years, WJZ-TV was programmed much like an independent station, as the ABC television network was still, for the most part, in its very early stages of development; the ABC-owned stations did air some common programming during this period, especially after the 1949 fall season when the network&#x27;s prime time schedule began to expand. The station&#x27;s original transmitter site was located at The Pierre Hotel at 2 East 61st Street, before moving to the Empire State Building a few years later. The station&#x27;s original studios were located at 77 West 66th Street, with additional studios at 7 West 66th Street. A tunnel linked ABC studios at 7 West 66th Street to the lobby of the Hotel des Artistes, a block north on West 67th Street. Another studio inside the Hotel des Artistes was used for &quot;Eyewitness News Conference&quot;.

===As WABC-TV (1953–present)===

The station&#x27;s call letters were changed to WABC-TV on March 1, 1953, after ABC merged its operations with United Paramount Theatres, a firm which was broken off from former parent company Paramount Pictures by decree of the U.S. government. The WJZ-TV callsign was later reassigned to Westinghouse Broadcasting (the original owners of WJZ radio in New York) as an historical nod in 1957 for their newly acquired television station in Baltimore – a station that was, by coincidence, an ABC affiliate until 1995.

As part of ABC&#x27;s expansion program, initiated in 1977, ABC built 7 Lincoln Square on the southeast corner of West 67th Street and Columbus Avenue, on the site of an abandoned moving and storage warehouse. At about the same time, construction was started at 30 West 67th Street on the site of a former parking lot. Both buildings were completed in June 1979 and WABC-TV moved its offices from 77 West 66th Street to 7 Lincoln Square.

On September 11, 2001, the transmitter facilities of WABC-TV, as well as eight other local television stations and several radio stations, were destroyed when two hijacked airplanes crashed into and destroyed the north and south towers of the World Trade Center. WABC-TV&#x27;s transmitter maintenance engineer Donald DiFranco died in the attack. In the immediate aftermath, the station fed its signal to WNYE-TV, WHSE-TV, WHSI-TV, and the New Jersey Network before establishing temporary facilities at the Armstrong Tower in Alpine, New Jersey. The station eventually re-established transmission facilities at the Empire State Building, its original home when it signed on the air in 1948.

ABC News Now was launched in 2004 on digital subchannels of the ABC O&amp;O stations. On January 31, 2005, ABC removed ABC News Now from O&amp;O and affiliated stations&#x27; subchannels as the channel ended its experimental phase originally. The group changed its programming on secondary channels to ABC Plus, a local news and public affairs format. ABC teamed up with AccuWeather to launch a multicast service on WABC&#x27;s third subchannel between December 9, 2005, and March 31, 2006.

On May 27, 2007, WABC-TV&#x27;s studios suffered major damage as the result of a fire that knocked the station off the air shortly before the start of the 11 p.m. newscast. According to preliminary reports, the fire may have been ignited by a spotlight coming into contact with a curtain inside the news studio; the station&#x27;s website later reported the cause as an &quot;electrical malfunction&quot;. The station&#x27;s building was evacuated and the fire was brought under control, though the studio was said to be &quot;badly damaged&quot;, having suffered smoke and water damage. WABC-TV resumed broadcasting at around 1 a.m. on May 28, 2007 (initially carrying the network&#x27;s 10 pm. West Coast feed of &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, followed by the full broadcast of &quot;World News Now&quot;). Due to the fire, the station broadcast &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; from the newsroom, while &quot;Live! with Regis and Kelly&quot;, whose set was also affected, moved to the set of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;. Starting with the 5 p.m. newscast on June 20, 2007, the station resumed the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; and &quot;Live!&quot; broadcasts from its main studios at Columbus Avenue and 66th Street.

The Live Well Network (LWN) was launched on April 27, 2009, in high definition by ABC&#x27;s O&amp;O stations on the stations&#x27; .2 subchannels.

WABC-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, VHF channel 7, at 12:30 p.m. on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 45 to VHF channel 7. WABC&#x27;s digital signal was initially difficult to receive over-the-air in New York City. The station was requested by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at a lower power; WABC was among many stations which have found it necessary to increase power to restore coverage to the same level as its former analog signal. On June 29, 2009, WABC filed an application with the FCC to increase power from 11.69 kW to 27 kW. On January 31, 2010, the FCC granted a special temporary authority (STA) for the station to increase power to 26.9 kW.

In May 2013, WABC-TV and Philadelphia sister station WPVI-TV became the first two ABC-owned stations to offer live, web-based streaming of programming to authenticated subscribers of participating cable and satellite television providers as provided through the relaunched &quot;Watch ABC&quot; mobile apps.

ABCOTS indicated in January 2015 that its stations&#x27; 3rd subchannel would affiliated with Laff network upon launch on April 15, 2015, but until then LWN would run on both subchannels. ABC Stations rebranded Live Well Network on .2 as Localish on February 17, 2020, to add an outlet for the Localish lifestyle content.

==Programming==
WABC has long presented events such as the Columbus Day Parade and Puerto Rican Day Parade and beginning in 2017, they became the first television station to air the New York City LGBT Pride March. In addition, the station is also producing local programs such as &quot;Here and Now&quot;, a program covering the latest issues, trends and news stories impacting the local black community, &quot;Tiempo&quot;, a weekly program that focus on the issues affecting local Hispanic citizens, and &quot;Up Close&quot;, a public affairs program on the latest issues with the newsmakers. The station also formerly produced &quot;Viewpoint&quot;, a weekly program that highlighted the cultural and community efforts in New York, Long Island and New Jersey (each of these regions rotated weekly).

As of 2023, aside from &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot;, WABC&#x27;s first-run syndicated programs include &quot;Tamron Hall&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;.

===&quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot;===
WABC-TV produces the nationally syndicated talk show &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot;. Until the station&#x27;s newscasts were moved to a separate studio in 2011, the program originated in the same ground-floor studio at 7 Lincoln Square as &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;, thus creating a situation which forced local news updates broadcast during &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;Live&quot; to be produced from the WABC-TV newsroom and the morning show&#x27;s presence also limited the size of the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; set.

The program&#x27;s roots originated with &quot;A.M. New York&quot;, which debuted in 1970 as a local version of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show; its first host was John Bartholomew Tucker, who remained with the program until 1972. After Tucker&#x27;s departure, a succession of hosts came and went, the most successful of whom was Stanley Siegel, who hosted from 1975 to 1978 (for a year beginning in 1977, the series was called &quot;The Stanley Siegel Show&quot;). After 1980, the show was retitled &quot;Good Morning New York&quot;, whose co-hosts in the last years of its run in that form included Spencer Christian, Andrea Kirby, Judy Licht, Dick Wolfsie and longtime &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; reporter and anchor Doug Johnson. After years of a losing ratings battle against &quot;Donahue&quot; on WNBC-TV, WABC-TV canceled &quot;Good Morning New York&quot; in early 1983.

The current show began as the station&#x27;s second attempt at a local morning show a month later, aptly titled &quot;The Morning Show&quot; (using the &quot;Circle 7&quot; logo in the actual text for one of the &quot;o&quot;s) and was originally hosted by Regis Philbin and Cyndy Garvey. After Garvey&#x27;s departure a year later, she was replaced by Ann Abernathy, who in turn, left in 1985 to return to Los Angeles. That year, Kathie Lee Johnson (who would marry Frank Gifford a year later) became Philbin&#x27;s new co-host.

In 1988, Buena Vista Television began syndicating the show nationally as &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;. Gifford left the show in 2000 and was eventually replaced by Kelly Ripa. Philbin left the show in November 2011 and the show aired for nearly a year as &quot;Live! with Kelly&quot; until former New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan became Ripa&#x27;s permanent co-host in September 2012. In May 2016, Strahan left the show to become a full-time anchor at &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, thus leaving Ripa as the solo host again. On May 1, 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest would become the new host of the show; to accommodate his syndicated radio show &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot; (which normally originates from Los Angeles), an additional studio was built within WABC&#x27;s facilities. Seacrest departed &quot;Live&quot; on April 14, 2023, and three days later Ripa&#x27;s husband, Mark Consuelos, became the new co-host of the show.

===Sports programming===
WABC-TV serves as the local over-the-air broadcaster of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games, airing simulcasts of the ESPN-televised games carried nationally on ABC. However, ESPN-only &quot;MNF&quot; telecasts involving the Giants or Jets air locally on WPIX. Previously, the station carried coverage of the Giants&#x27; victory in Super Bowl XXV.

Since 2013, WABC-TV serves as the exclusive local English-language carrier of the annual New York City Marathon. The station preempts a weekend edition of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and delays &quot;This Week&quot; to schedule time for the live broadcast. The marathon is also simulcast on ESPN2 nationally (although viewers in the Tri-State area cannot see it via ESPN2 because the simulcast is blacked out locally).

WABC-TV currently airs any New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets games televised via the &quot;NBA on ABC&quot;. The station has aired the Knicks&#x27; appearances in the 1970, 1972 and 1973 NBA Finals (where the Knicks won in 1970 and 1973), as well as the then-New Jersey Nets&#x27; appearance in the 2003 NBA Finals.

WABC-TV aired New York Rangers, New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils games carried through the &quot;NHL on ABC&quot;; this included the Devils&#x27; victories in the 2000 and 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, as well as their appearance in the 2001 Stanley Cup Finals. Beginning in 2021, it officially reassumed this duty, this time as the OTA simulcast partner of the &quot;NHL on ESPN&quot;.

Through the ABC portion of the &quot;MLS on ESPN&quot; package, WABC-TV aired New York City FC&#x27;s victory in the 2021 MLS Cup and the New York Red Bulls&#x27; appearance in the 2008 MLS Cup.

WABC-TV also previously aired any New York Yankees and New York Mets games through ABC&#x27;s baseball contract; this included the Yankees&#x27; victory in the 1977 World Series and appearance in the 1981 World Series.

===News operation===
WABC-TV presently broadcasts 48 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7 hours, 35 minutes each weekday and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station partners with Philadelphia sister station, WPVI-TV—which popularized the &quot;Action News&quot; format—in the production and broadcast of statewide New Jersey political debates. When the two stations broadcast a statewide office debate, such as for Governor or U.S. Senate, they pool resources and have anchors or reporters from both stations participate in the debate. Additionally, the two stations share coverage of news from New Jersey where their markets overlap, pooling reporters, live trucks, and helicopters.

WABC-TV launched &quot;Report to New York&quot;, its first regular news program, on October 26, 1959, featuring Scott Vincent with news, Howard Cosell with sports, and Lynn Dollar with the weather. &quot;Report to New York&quot; aired Monday through Friday at 11 pm. By January 1961, channel 7 expanded &quot;Report to New York&quot; with a 15-minute early edition at 6:15 p.m. on weeknights, and on Saturday and Sunday evenings.

On October 22, 1962, WABC-TV expanded its weeknight news to 45 minutes, and retitled it &quot;The Big News&quot;. Newcomers Bill Beutel and Jim Burnes were the anchors, with Cosell continuing on sports and Rosemary Haley as &quot;weather girl&quot;. However, this effort failed to draw viewers from the ratings leader WCBS-TV and second-place WNBC-TV.

=====The &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; era=====
In early 1968, Beutel left the station to become the London bureau chief for ABC News and was replaced by Roger Grimsby, who was transferred by ABC from San Francisco sister station KGO-TV. In a complete revamp, Grimsby was joined by Tex Antoine doing weather, celebrity gossip columnist Rona Barrett, &quot;New York Daily News&quot; columnist Jimmy Breslin with political commentary and reviews by Martin Bookspan and Allan Jeffries, while Cosell continued doing sports. Known as &quot;Roger Grimsby and the Noisemakers&quot;, this format didn&#x27;t help the ratings, which plunged to an all-time low.

Later that year, newly hired news director Al Primo brought to WABC-TV the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format and branding, in which reporters present their stories directly to the viewers. Having experienced great success introducing the format during his time at KYW-TV in Philadelphia, Primo this time added a twist – a degree of conversational chatter among the anchors, known as &quot;happy talk&quot;. The &quot;Tar Sequence&quot; cue from the musical score of the 1967 film &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;, composed by Lalo Schifrin, was introduced as the theme music. The score included a telegraphic-style melody appropriate for a newscast. The &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format and theme music were quickly adopted by ABC&#x27;s other four owned-and-operated stations at the time: KGO-TV, WLS-TV in Chicago, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and KABC-TV in Los Angeles (though KGO-TV and WXYZ-TV did not use the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; title for their programs). The format quickly rejuvenated a station that had long been an also-ran to WCBS-TV and WNBC-TV. Within a year, Channel 7 had shot to first place in the ratings for the first time in its history, displacing longtime leader WCBS-TV. It spent most of the decade going back and forth with WCBS-TV for first place. For a time in the 1980s, it fell into last place among the network-owned stations, but still fought with WNBC-TV for second place.

Retaining only Grimsby, Cosell, and Antoine from the earlier &quot;Noisemakers&quot; format, Primo also hired Tom Dunn away from WCBS-TV to serve as Grimsby&#x27;s co-anchor. After Dunn departed for WOR-TV in 1970, Bill Beutel returned to the station as his replacement and for the next 16 years, Grimsby and Beutel were the faces of &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;.

The Grimsby-Beutel team were split up for several months in 1975 after ABC had reassigned Beutel to its new morning show, &quot;AM America&quot; that January. The station brought in WXYZ-TV&#x27;s Bill Bonds and veteran Boston anchor Tom Ellis to help replace Beutel, with Grimsby teaming with Ellis at 6 p.m. and Bonds at 11 pm. When &quot;AM America&quot; was canceled and replaced with &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in November 1975, Beutel was re-teamed with Grimsby at 6 p.m, with Ellis joining Bonds at 11 pm. Bonds returned to Detroit in June 1976 and was replaced by Larry Kane, who lasted only one year as the sole 11 p.m. anchor before returning to his home market of Philadelphia. Ellis remained until May 1977 and Kane&#x27;s successor, Ernie Anastos, began his New York career at the station; he co-anchored at 11 p.m. with Rose Ann Scamardella and later Kaity Tong for most of his tenure there.

On November 30, 1981, the station became the second in the city to expand its late afternoon/evening newscasts by adding of a 5 p.m. edition. The broadcast was initially anchored by weather forecaster Storm Field along with Scamardella; Anastos, and later Tong, would replace them. Tom Snyder, who joined WABC after his late night talk show, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, was canceled, would take Anastos&#x27; place in 1982 and would remain at the station until 1984; WABC attempted an early afternoon, feature-driven newscast shortly thereafter with Anastos and Beutel anchoring &quot;Eyewitness Extra&quot;, but the program was short lived and was canceled in early 1983.

In 1985, the station lured WLS-TV&#x27;s news director, Bill Applegate, from Chicago to New York City. Applegate claimed credit for taking WLS-TV from last to first in only two years and ABC hoped he could work the same magic at the flagship station. In the wake of declining ratings, Grimsby was fired on April 16, 1986, a move for which Applegate drew considerable ire and Grimsby was quickly hired by rival WNBC-TV. In 1987, Channel 7 surged back into first place. It has been the ratings leader in New York City since then, and has grown to become the most-watched broadcast television station in the United States. Beutel stepped down from the anchor desk in 2001, which concluded the longest tenure for a main anchor in New York City television history at that time. His record has since been surpassed by WNBC&#x27;s Chuck Scarborough and WXTV&#x27;s Rafael Pineda. Scarborough&#x27;s uninterrupted run behind the desk is the longest in New York television (since 1974). Pineda is second, having started with WXTV in 1972, retiring in 2013 after 41 years.

=====2000–present=====
WABC-TV&#x27;s news department is respected for its straightforward presentation (especially during breaking news). For the last decade, it has waged a spirited battle for first place, but for most of the time has held onto the lead, helped in part by lead-ins from the highly rated talk and entertainment shows. For over 24 years (December 1986 to May 2011), the lead-in for the 5 p.m. &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; broadcast had been &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; at 4 p.m. and its strong ratings brought viewers along to the 5 p.m. newscast.

The newscasts were replayed on one of channel 7&#x27;s digital subchannels, another which also carried local weather and news channel. WABC-TV&#x27;s website had a link for live streaming video of &quot;Channel 7 Eyewitness News NOW&quot;, which offered live local and national weather updated from AccuWeather alongside local news. The format of &quot;Eyewitness News NOW&quot; is similar to the defunct NBC Weather Plus. On February 24, 2011, AccuWeather and ABC both replaced ENN as well as similar news channels on WABC-TV&#x27;s sister stations, KABC-TV in Los Angeles and WLS-TV in Chicago, replacing them in all three cities with a standard definition, letterboxed simulcast of the Live Well Network, and then on April 15, 2015, these stations were replaced by Laff.

On December 2, 2006, WABC-TV became the second station in the New York City market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. On September 7, 2010, WABC-TV expanded its weekday morning newscast, moving its start time to 4:30 am. Three days earlier on September 4, 2010, WABC added an hour-long extension of its Saturday morning newscast from 9 a.m. to 10 am. On May 26, 2011, WABC-TV added another hour of local news at 4 p.m. to replace &quot;Oprah&quot;, which aired its last original episode the previous day.

On September 24, 2011, the station began broadcasting its newscasts and public affairs programs from a new street-level window studio at a former Disney Store location in the ABC building on 66th Street and Columbus Avenue. The space previously used for news broadcasts was used to expand the &quot;Live with Kelly&quot; studio. In January 2012, the station also expanded its weekend 11 p.m. newscasts to an hour. On September 8, 2014, the station expanded its Noon newscast to one full hour from the previous half-hour.

On January 31, 2022, WABC announced they would be launching a streaming channel titled &quot;ABC 7 New York 24/7 Stream&quot;. As part of the launch of the service, WABC announced a new 6:30 p.m. newscast, available only through the stream.

On September 11, 2023, WABC-TV, along with sister stations WPVI-TV and WTVD in Durham, North Carolina, launched an additional hour-long newscast at 10 a.m. which took over the time slot previously occupied by &quot;Tamron Hall&quot;. The broadcast delivers news in a traditional format, and also allows more focus to be placed on local newsmakers, and further discussion on topics addressed on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot;. WABC delayed its launch by one day, due to coverage of events in the city, marking the anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001.

WABC-TV left its longtime home of Lincoln Square for a new Disney campus, located at Hudson Square in Lower Manhattan, on February 22, 2025.

==Subchannels==
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

==Carriage disputes==
===Cablevision (2010)===
On March 7, 2010, at 12:02 am. WABC-TV&#x27;s signal was removed from Cablevision&#x27;s New York area systems (including iO Digital Cable) after the two sides failed to reach terms on a new retransmission consent agreement; the station was replaced by either a blank screen or a looping video containing a message from Cablevision about the removal. To avoid interruption of programming, the station urged Cablevision subscribers in the station&#x27;s viewing area (totaling up to three million subscribers) to switch to other services, such as Verizon FiOS and DirecTV or simply view the station over the air through an over-the-air digital antenna and if necessary, a digital converter box, for older television sets. WABC&#x27;s sister station, WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, was also pulled from Cablevision&#x27;s New Jersey systems in Mercer, Ocean and Monmouth counties.

Later that same day at approximately 8:50 p.m. 20 minutes into ABC&#x27;s broadcast of the 82nd Academy Awards, Cablevision and ABC reached a deal, restoring WABC and WPVI&#x27;s signals for Cablevision subscribers after a nearly 21-hour blackout.

===Time Warner Cable (2010)===
In July 2010, ABC&#x27;s parent company Disney announced that it was involved in a carriage dispute with Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum), its first with that provider in 10 years. This dispute involved four ABC owned-and-operated stations (WABC-TV and sister stations KABC-TV, WTVD and WTVG in Toledo, Ohio [the latter station would be sold by ABC the next year]), Disney Channel and the ESPN networks. If a deal was not in place, the affected stations and cable channels would have been removed from Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks systems across the country. On September 2, 2010, Disney and Time Warner Cable reached a long-term agreement to keep the channels on Time Warner Cable systems.

===Charter Spectrum (2023)===
On August 31, 2023, Disney removed all of its channels, including WABC-TV, two other ABC-owned stations, and the ESPN networks, from Spectrum cable systems due to a carriage dispute, its first with the provider since 2010 when its predecessor, Time Warner Cable, was involved in a dispute with Disney. On September 11, 2023, the stations and their sister cable channels were restored by Charter Communications (the parent company of Spectrum) after the company and Disney reached an agreement.

===DirecTV (2024)===
On September 1, 2024, Disney pulled its networks from DirecTV after the two sides failed to reach a distribution deal. The removal, which included WABC-TV and ESPN, would ultimately impact the New York Jets&#x27; season-opening game on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; against the San Francisco 49ers (ABC simulcast ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the game). Disney and DirecTV ended their standoff on September 14, restoring WABC and ESPN to the satellite provider.

<text>Soko () was a Yugoslav aircraft manufacturer based in Mostar, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina. The company was responsible for the production of many military aircraft for the Yugoslav Air Force.

SOKO was created in 1950 by the relocation of the aircraft factory section of Ikarus company from Zemun, SR Serbia. Officially founded as &quot;Preduzeće Soko&quot; (Soko Corporation, &quot;soko&quot; meaning &quot;falcon&quot; in Serbian), soon after it was renamed &quot;Soko Vazduhoplovna Industrija, RO Vazduhoplovstvo&quot; (Soko Aeronautical Industry, WO (Work Organization) Aeronautics). Its first director was Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army colonel Ivan Sert. The following directors of the company were engineers Miljenko Pješčić and Tomislav Mirić. The serial manufacture of numerous types of aircraft was projected by the Aeronautical Technical Institute in Belgrade. Besides aircraft, SOKO also produced helicopters under licence. Located in the vicinity of Mostar, it mostly used the Mostar Airport for test flights.

By the 1980s, SOKO was working on the Novi Avion project, intended to develop an indigenous fourth-generation, supersonic multi-role fighter that would enabled the Yugoslav Air Force to be supplied with domestically-built modern fighters. The production was planned to begin around 1991; however, the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the enactment of an international arms embargo caused the project to be cancelled. During the early 1990s, the factory ceased aircraft production altogether. The facilities were partially dismantled and relocated to Serbia, where they were aligned with the Utva Aviation Industry in Pančevo which had already been working closely with SOKO in the manufacturing of Orao and Super Galeb.

==History==
During the late 1940s, as a result of the Yugoslav government&#x27;s policy to relocate Serbian industry, a large portion of both the infrastructure and personal from the aeronautical section of the Ikarus company from Zemun, SR Serbia was uprooted and transferred to Mostar, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina. During 1950, these assets were integrated into the newly formed aircraft manufacturer SOKO, which immediately begin working on various aeronautical technologies. During these early years, the company produced the Soko 522 trainer aircraft, as well as providing maintenance support for the Yugoslav Air Force, particularly its fleet of American-built F-84 Thunderjet fighters.

During 1957, Yugoslavia&#x27;s VTI (Aeronautical Technical Institute) commenced design work on what would subsequently become the Soko G-2 Galeb. The principal purpose for its development was to produce a domestic replacement for the American-built Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, which at the time was the most commonly used jet trainer aircraft in use by the Yugoslav Air Force; thus, the Galeb was to be capable of meeting the varied qualities and requirements involved in performing &quot;ab initio&quot;, intermediate, and advanced instructional training missions. The Galeb was developed as a collaborative effort between Yugoslavia and the United Kingdom, and reportedly contributed significantly to the export value of the latter; a significant proportion of components and ancillary equipment, such as the powerplant, ejector seats, and navigational fittings amongst others, that were installed upon the aircraft had been sourced from or were directly produced by a range of British aerospace manufacturers. Sponsorship for the aircraft&#x27;s development was provided by the British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce Limited, whose Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engine was selected to power the type.
During 1964, production of the Galeb commenced, making it the first indigenously-developed jet aircraft to enter mass production in Yugoslavia (the first jet-powered plane built by Yugoslavia was the Ikarus 451M in 1952, which did not enter production). A ground attack-orientated derivative of the Galeb, named the J-21 Jastreb, was also developed shortly thereafter; aside from the strengthening of the airframe, one distinct difference between the two aircraft was the deletion of the rear cockpit on the J-21 Jastreb, this location has instead been covered by a fairing and the internal space used to contain avionics and other aircraft equipment. Beyond domestic adoption with the Yugoslav Air force, the Galeb achieved export sales as well; the Libyan Air Force was a prolific operator of the type; by 2002, it reportedly possessed a total of 80 aircraft remaining in its inventory.

During 1970, the neighbouring nations of Romania and Yugoslavia began discussions on the subject of jointly developing a new ground-attack orientated fighter aircraft. On 20 May 1971, the Romanian and Yugoslavian governments signed an agreement for the formation of &quot;YuRom&quot;, a joint research and development venture between the two nations. According to aviation author John C. Fredriksen, the announcement was a logical extension of political policy, as the two nations&#x27; heads of state, Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and Nicolae Ceaușescu, had both historically sought to avoid overreliance upon the Soviet Union, preferring to build ties and cooperative projects with other friendly or neutral nations. Due to political sensitivities and a strong desire to avoid one nation upstaging the other, the aircraft featured two separate names; in Romania, it was known as the IAR-93 Vultur while in Yugoslavia it was referred to as the Soko J-22 Orao. Serial production of the J-22 was performed at SOKO&#x27;s Mostar facility, production was brought to a halt in 1992, and the factory itself heavily damaged, by the series of events commonly referred to as the Yugoslav Wars. Various upgrade programmes for the J-22 were proposed during the 1990s; reportedly, such efforts would have been focused upon its avionics. However, such ambitions were heavily undermined by the dismantling of the Mostar factory during the Yugoslav Wars and the collapse of Romania&#x27;s communist government.
Another programme begun during the 1970s would result in the development of the G-4 Super Galeb; it was designed as a replacement for Yugoslav Air Force&#x27;s existing inventory of G-2 Galebs. According to aviation periodical Flight International, the Super Galeb showed unmistakable lineage from the earlier G-2, sharing the same British-sourced Rolls-Royce Viper turbojet engine, albeit uprated for greater performance. However, aviation historian Christopher Chant notes that: &quot;the Super Galeb bares no more relation to the G-2 Galeb than an identity of role, being an altogether more advanced aircraft. Beyond the domestic market, it also competed internationally against jet trainers such as the Italian Aermacchi MB-339, the Czechoslovakian Aero L-39 Albatros, and the Spanish CASA C-101; Flight International observes that, while the Super Galeb offered less performance that the Franco-German Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet, it was substantially cheaper to procure.

During the mid-1980s, the Novi Avion programme was initiated with the aim of increasing Yugoslavia&#x27;s political independence by becoming self-sufficient in the manufacture of military equipment; at that point, air superiority fighter jets were the only major element in which Yugoslavia was still reliant upon imports, having obtained the capability to manufacture all other military equipment. Thus, the Avion was intended to be used as a replacement for the Yugoslavian Air Force&#x27;s fleet of around 120 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s. Development was a recognised priority programme for the Yugoslavian People&#x27;s Army and was partly funded by the national government out of general research and development and modernisation funds, as well as being partly provided by industry. The Novi Avion was to be Yugoslavia&#x27;s first supersonic aircraft, accordingly, the national industry lacked experience in the design and testing of such fighters and sought out external partners to provide assistance. Both France and French company Dassault Aviation&#x27;s upcoming Rafale fighter bore a heavy influence on the design of the Avion.

During the 1990s, Yugoslavia disintegrated into several different nations, which quickly resulted in the Avion programme being abandoned due to the financial resources necessary to start production of the fighter having become unavailable following the break-up of the country. Reportedly, work had been initially halted due to the lack of funding while further efforts were made to acquire foreign partnership arrangements. If the development had not been terminated, the first aircraft was scheduled to have conduct its maiden flight during 1992; the Avion was reportedly expected to enter squadron service at some point during the mid-2000s.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, SOKO was involved in various partnerships. In addition to working with Avioane Craiova to co-develop the J-22 Orao/IAR-93, Soko also cooperated with Sikorsky, Westland and Aérospatiale in producing various helicopters under license. Throughout the company&#x27;s existence, its aircraft production activities were mainly destined to fulfill the needs of the Yugoslav Air Force, but exporting aircraft was also an option. J-1 Jastreb were exported to Libya and Zambia. G-2 Galeb was exported to Libya, Zaire and Zambia. Six Super Galebs were exported to Burma, while the start of the Yugoslav wars and the international sanctions halted the production and blocked outstanding orders for the G-4 Super Galeb to Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.

<doc id="65504" wikidata="Q348163" url="?curid=65504" title="John Poindexter">
<text>John Marlan Poindexter (born August 12, 1936) is a retired United States naval officer and Department of Defense official. He was Deputy National Security Advisor and National Security Advisor during the Reagan administration. He was convicted in April 1990 of multiple felonies as a result of his actions in the Iran–Contra affair, but his convictions were reversed on appeal in 1991. During the George W. Bush administration, he served a brief stint as the director of the DARPA Information Awareness Office. He is the father of NASA astronaut and U.S. Navy Captain Alan G. Poindexter.

==Early life and career==
Poindexter was born in Odon, Indiana, the son of Marlan G. and Ellen (Sommers) Poindexter. He received his undergraduate degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1958, where he graduated first in a class of 899. His fellow graduates included astronaut Bruce McCandless II (who graduated second) and Senator John McCain; previous National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane was a contemporary, graduating the following year.

Poindexter received an MS (1961) and PhD (1964) in nuclear physics from the California Institute of Technology. For his dissertation, he conducted laboratory research to develop further a model for understanding the Mössbauer effect with Nobel Laureate Rudolf Mössbauer.

==Senior naval career==
While commander of Destroyer Squadron 31, Poindexter was surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare commander of battle groups in the Western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, and he developed new tactics and battle management procedures under the Composite Warfare Commander concept. As the commanding officer of , he pioneered the shipboard use of computers to manage the ship&#x27;s force portion of yard overhauls. He was also an executive officer and a chief engineer of destroyers.

As deputy commander of the Naval Education and Training Command, he led the United States Navy&#x27;s extensive education and training programs. He launched the development of a distributed data management system to better manage training pipelines.

His staff assignments included: executive assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations, administrative assistant to the Secretary of the Navy and special assistant for Systems Analysis to the Secretary of Defense. He reached the rank of vice admiral while serving as National Security Advisor, but was reverted to the rank of rear admiral in 1986 for his role in the Iran–Contra affair. He retired at that rank in 1987.

==U.S. executive branch service==
Poindexter served in the Reagan administration as military assistant to the National Security Advisor from 1981 to 1983. From 1983 to 1985, he served as Deputy National Security Advisor, leading the National Security Council&#x27;s Crisis Pre-planning Group. From 1985 to 1986, he was National Security Advisor, providing recommendations to the President on national security, foreign policy and defense policy.

He played a significant role in the Strategic Defense Initiative, Operation Urgent Fury, the Achille Lauro incident, Operation El Dorado Canyon (in response to Libyan terrorist attacks), and the Reykjavík Summit with the Soviets.

===Iran–Contra affair===

In the Iran–Contra affair, Poindexter and Oliver North sent aid to the Contras and money and weapons to Iran to secure the release of American hostages from Lebanon. This violated the Boland Amendment, which forbade the United States from directly or indirectly being involved with the Contras. Evidence revealed that Poindexter was a leader in the organization of the transfer of the weapons to Iran and oversaw other people involved in the affair, such as Oliver North.

Poindexter and North communicated through a channel known as the &quot;Private Blank Check&quot; which Poindexter set up on a National Security Council (NSC) computer. Through this system, Poindexter and North were able to send messages called PROFS notes back and forth without being intercepted by other NSC staff members. This system was not successful. Even though both Poindexter and North attempted to delete the messages, the White House Communications Agency was able to recover some of them, later used in trying Poindexter and North in court. On November 25, 1986, after the public disclosure of the Iran–Contra affair, Poindexter was forced to resign from his position as National Security Advisor.

Poindexter was convicted on April 7, 1990, of five counts of lying to Congress and obstructing the Congressional committees investigating the Iran–Contra affair, which were investigating the Reagan Administration&#x27;s covert arms sales to Iran and the diversion of proceeds to insurgents fighting to overthrow the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The convictions were reversed in 1991 on appeal on the grounds that several witnesses against him had been influenced by his testimony before Congress, even though Congress had given him immunity for that testimony.

To protest his involvement in the Iran-Contra Affair, Bill Breeden, a local minister and political activist, stole a street sign bearing Poindexter&#x27;s name in his home town of Odon, Indiana. The sign was eventually returned but not before making national headlines and resulting in Breeden&#x27;s arrest.

==Defense contractor work==
From 1988 to 1989, Poindexter was senior scientist at Presearch, Inc., which had primarily been involved with defense studies and analysis. Faced with anticipated defense budget reductions, Poindexter joined the firm to develop new commercial enterprises. He designed and developed hardware and software for the prototype of a digital real-time imaging system to be used for physical security of high-value facilities. It was used to obtain a contract for a nuclear power plant security system.

From 1990 to 1996, Poindexter was the chief designer and programmer for TP Systems, Inc., a software development firm that he co-founded to specialize in commercial software for the IBM PCs and compatibles. Development included a symbolic debugger for multi-tasking environments, a BBS communications program, and numerous utility programs.

From 1993 to 1996, Poindexter served as a consultant to Elkins Group, a business alliance with Electronic Data Systems (EDS), that developed the Elkins Interactive Training Network (EITN), a satellite-based training delivery system. Poindexter was the chairman of the Maritime Advisory Committee and a member of Elkins&#x27; board of directors. He also provided advice on strategic planning.

From 1996 to 2002, Poindexter served as senior vice president for SYNTEK Technologies, a small high-technology firm with contracts in domestic and international defense and commercial business. Poindexter gave high-level advice on management and directed information systems projects (for example, Defense Advanced Research Project Agency&#x27;s Project Genoa).

In 2000, he joined the board of Saffron Technology, where he played a role building a tool to run entity analysis on Iraqi insurgent networks that planted IEDs.

In 2007, he joined the board of Bright Planet Corporation.

After 2007, Poindexter worked to promote fraud-detecting Associative Memory Base technology to civilian government agencies such as the IRS.

==Recall to public service==
Late in 2001, upon the recommendation of Science Applications International Corporation executive Brian Hicks, then-Vice President Dick Cheney recommended Admiral Poindexter to head a separate anti-terrorist office and serve under US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

===Information Awareness Office===
From January 2002 to August 2003, Poindexter served as the Director of the DARPA Information Awareness Office (IAO). The mission of the IAO was to imagine, develop, apply, integrate, demonstrate and move information technologies, components, and prototype closed-loop information systems. This aimed to counter asymmetric threats (most notably, terrorist threats) by achieving total information awareness and thus aiding preemption, national security warning, and national security decision making.

===Policy Analysis Market===
Poindexter faced criticism from the media and some politicians about the Policy Analysis Market project, a theoretical prediction market that would have rewarded participants for accurately predicting geopolitical trends in the Middle East and elsewhere. This was portrayed in the media as allowing participants to profit from the assassination of heads of state and acts of terrorism due to such events being mentioned on illustrative sample screens showing the interface. The controversy over the proposed futures market led to a Congressional audit of the IAO in general. Funding for the IAO was subsequently cut and Poindexter retired from DARPA on August 12, 2003.

==Family==
His wife, Linda Poindexter, was an Episcopal priest for 13 years, but retired from the clergy when she converted to Catholicism. They have five sons, including the late Alan G. Poindexter, a NASA astronaut, Space Shuttle pilot on the STS-122 mission to the International Space Station, and the commander of STS-131, Mark Alan (* 1963), Joseph Chester (* 1971) and Daniel John.

<doc id="65508" wikidata="Q171663" url="?curid=65508" title="Great Seal of the United States">
<text>The Great Seal is the seal of the United States. The phrase is used both for the impression device itself, which is kept by the United States secretary of state, and more generally for the impression it produces. The obverse of the Great Seal depicts the national coat of arms of the United States while the reverse features a truncated pyramid topped by an Eye of Providence. The year of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, 1776, is noted in Roman numerals at the base of the pyramid. The seal contains three Latin phrases: &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; (&quot;Out of many, one&quot;), &quot;Annuit cœptis&quot; (&quot;He has favored our undertakings&quot;), and &quot;Novus ordo seclorum&quot; (&quot;A new order of the ages&quot;).

Largely designed by Charles Thomson, secretary of the Continental Congress, and William Barton, and first used in 1782, the seal is used to authenticate certain documents issued by the federal government of the United States. Since 1935, both sides of the Great Seal have appeared on the reverse of the one-dollar bill. The coat of arms is used on official documents—including United States passports—military insignia, embassy placards, and various flags. The seal of the president of the United States is directly based on the Great Seal, and its elements are used in numerous government agency and state seals.

Today&#x27;s official versions from the Department of State are largely unchanged from the 1885 designs. The current rendering of the reverse was made by Teagle &amp; Little of Norfolk, Virginia, in 1972. It is nearly identical to previous versions, which in turn were based on Lossing&#x27;s 1856 version.

== Obverse ==
The obverse (or front) of the seal depicts the full achievement of the national coat of arms.

===Blazon===

The 1782 resolution of Congress adopting the arms, still in force, legally blazoned the shield as:
As the designers recognized, this is a technically incorrect blazon under traditional English heraldic rules, since in English practice a vertically striped shield would be described as &quot;paly&quot;, not &quot;paleways&quot;, and it would not have had an odd number of stripes. A more technically proper blazon would have been &quot;argent, six pallets gules ...&quot; (six red stripes on a white field), but the phrase used was chosen to preserve the reference to the 13 original states.

The escutcheon (shield) bears resemblance to the United States flag, with two exceptions in particular:
* The blue chief contains no stars (although certain derivative arms do, e.g. the chief of the arms of the United States Senate).
* The outermost stripes are white, not red, to avoid violation of the rule of tincture, as the chief is blue.

The supporter of the shield is a bald eagle with its wings outstretched (or &quot;displayed&quot;, in heraldic terms). From the eagle&#x27;s perspective, it holds a bundle of 13 arrows in its left talon, and an olive branch in its right talon. Although not specified by law, the olive branch is usually depicted with 13 leaves and 13 olives. In its beak, the eagle clutches a scroll with the motto &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; (&quot;Out of Many, One&quot;). Over its head there appears a glory with 13 mullets (stars) on a blue field.

===Stated symbolism===
The recurring number 13 refers to the 13 original states. The arrows and olive branch together symbolize that the United States has &quot;a strong desire for peace, but will always be ready for war.&quot; (see Olive Branch Petition). E Pluribus Unum contains 13 letters.

The eagle has its head turned towards the olive branch, on its right side, to symbolize a preference for peace.

The primary official explanation of the symbolism of the great seal was given by Charles Thomson upon presenting the final design for adoption by Congress. He wrote:

Thomson took the symbolism for the colors from &quot;Elements of Heraldry&quot;, by Antoine Pyron du Martre, which William Barton had lent him. That book said that argent (white) &quot;signifies Purity, Innocence, Beauty, and Genteelness&quot;, gules (red) &quot;denotes martial Prowess, Boldness, and Hardiness&quot;, and azure (blue) &quot;signifies Justice, Perseverance, and Vigilance&quot;.

A brief and official explanation of the symbolism was prepared in the form of a historical sketch, or pamphlet, of the seal of the United States, entitled, &quot;The Seal of the United States: How it was Developed and Adopted&quot;. It was written by Gaillard Hunt in 1892 under the direction of then Secretary of State James G. Blaine. When the copyright on the pamphlet expired, Hunt expounded upon the information in more detail. This was published in 1909 in a book titled&quot; The History of the Seal of the United States.&quot; This work was largely based on a two-volume work written in 1897 by Charles A. L. Totten titled &quot;Our Inheritance in the Great Seal of Manasseh, the United States of America: Its History and Heraldry; and Its Signification unto the &#x27;Great People&#x27; thus Sealed.&quot; Hunt&#x27;s account greatly details how the seal was chosen, containing sketches of other suggestions for a great seal which were made, such as Franklin&#x27;s suggested motto &quot;Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God&quot;, information on the illegal seal, iterations and changes that have been made to the seal, and it also includes detailed descriptions of the symbology of the great seal (such as that provided by Charles Thomson).

===Depictions===
The colors (&quot;tinctures&quot;) of the coat of arms are either reproduced directly, or represented monochromatically by means of heraldic hatching. The latter applies when the seal is affixed to paper.

====Official die designs====
In the Department of State, the term &quot;Great Seal&quot; refers to a physical mechanism which is used by the department to affix the seal to official government documents. This mechanism includes not only the die (metal engraved with a raised inverse image of the seal), but also the counterdie (also known as a counter-seal), the press, and cabinet in which it is housed. There have been several presses used since the seal was introduced, but none of the mechanisms used from 1782 through 1904 have survived. The seal and its press were saved when Washington, D.C. was burned in 1814, though no one knows who rescued the pieces.

The press in use today was made in 1903 by R. Hoe &amp; Co&#x27;s chief cabinetmaker Frederick S. Betchley in conjunction with the 1904 die, with the cabinet being made of mahogany. It is marked with the contracted completion date of June 15, 1903, but delays and reworking pushed final delivery into early 1904. From 1945 to 1955, the Great Seal changed quarters almost once a year. In 1955, the seal was put on public display for the first time in a central location in the department&#x27;s main building. In 1961 the Seal became the focus of the new Department Exhibit Hall, where it resides today in a glass enclosure. The enclosure remains locked at all times, even during the sealing of a document.

The seal can only be affixed by an officer of the Department of State, under the authority of the secretary of state. To seal a document, first a blank paper wafer is glued onto its front in a space provided for it. The document is then placed between the die and counterdie, with the wafer lined up between them. Holding the document with one hand, the weighted arm of the press is pulled with the other, driving the die down onto the wafer, impressing the seal in relief. When envelopes containing letters need to be sealed, the wafer is imprinted first and then glued to the sealed envelope. It is used approximately 2,000 to 3,000 times a year.

Documents which require the seal include treaty ratifications, international agreements, appointments of ambassadors and civil officers, and communications from the President to heads of foreign governments. The seal was once required on presidential proclamations, and on some now-obsolete documents such as exequaturs and Mediterranean passports.
The metallic die of the obverse side of the Great Seal is what actually embosses the design onto documents. These dies eventually wear down, requiring replacements to be made. The current die is the seventh engraving of the seal, and the actual design on the dies has evolved over time.

====Other====
==Reverse==
The 1782 resolution adopting the seal blazons the image on the reverse as &quot;A pyramid unfinished. In the zenith an eye in a triangle, surrounded by a glory, proper.&quot; The pyramid is conventionally shown as consisting of 13 courses to refer to the thirteen original states. The adopting resolution provides that it is inscribed on its base with the date (1776, the year of the United States Declaration of Independence) in Roman numerals. Where the top of the pyramid should be, the Eye of Providence watches over it. Two mottos appear: &quot;Annuit cœptis&quot; signifies that Providence has &quot;approved of (our) undertakings.&quot; &quot;Novus ordo seclorum&quot;, freely taken from Virgil, is Latin for &quot;a new order of the ages.&quot; The reverse has never been cut (as a seal) but appears, for example, on the back of the one-dollar bill.

The primary official explanation of the symbolism of the great seal was given by Charles Thomson upon presenting the final design for adoption by Congress. He wrote:

Thomson took the symbolism for the colors from &quot;Elements of Heraldry&quot;, by Antoine Pyron du Martré, which William Barton had lent him. That book said that argent (white) &quot;signifies Purity, Innocence, Beauty, and Genteelness&quot;, gules (red) &quot;denotes martial Prowess, Boldness, and Hardiness&quot;, and azure (blue) &quot;signifies Justice, Perseverance, and Vigilance&quot;.

===Conspiracy theories===

Some conspiracy theories state that the Great Seal shows a sinister influence by Freemasonry in the founding of the United States. Such theories usually claim that the Eye of Providence (found, in the Seal, above the pyramid) is a common Masonic emblem, and that the Great Seal was created by Freemasons. These claims, however, misstate the facts.

While the Eye of Providence is today a common Masonic motif, this was not the case during the 1770s and 1780s, when the Great Seal was designed and approved. According to David Barrett, a Masonic researcher, the Eye seems to have been used only sporadically by the Masons in those decades, and was not adopted as a common Masonic symbol until 1797, several years after the Great Seal of the United States had already been designed. The Eye of Providence was, on the other hand, a fairly common Christian motif throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and was commonly used as such in Europe as well as America throughout the 18th century. It is still found in Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant churches, and it symbolizes the Holy Trinity (the triangle) and God&#x27;s omniscience (the eye) surrounded by rays of glory, denoting God&#x27;s divinity.

Furthermore, contrary to the claims of these conspiracy theories, the Great Seal was not created by Freemasons. While Benjamin Franklin was a Mason, he was the only member of any of the various Great Seal committees definitively known to be so, and his ideas were not adopted. Of the four men whose ideas were adopted, neither Charles Thomson, Pierre du Simitière nor William Barton was a Mason and, while Francis Hopkinson has been alleged to have had Masonic connections, there is no firm evidence to support the claim.

== Origin ==
On July 4, 1776, the same day that independence from Great Britain was declared by the thirteen colonies, the Continental Congress named the first committee to design a Great Seal, or national emblem, for the country. Similar to other nations, the United States needed an official symbol of sovereignty to formalize and seal (or sign) international treaties and transactions. It took six years, three committees, and the contributions of fourteen men before the Congress finally accepted a design (which included elements proposed by each of the three committees) in 1782.

===First committee===
The first committee consisted of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams. While they were three of the five primary authors of the Declaration of Independence, they had little experience in heraldry and sought the help of Pierre Eugene du Simitiere, an artist living in Philadelphia who would later also design the state seals of Delaware and New Jersey and start a museum of the Revolutionary War. Each of these men proposed a design for the seal.

Franklin chose an allegorical scene from Exodus, described in his notes as &quot;Moses standing on the Shore, and extending his Hand over the Sea, thereby causing the same to overwhelm Pharaoh who is sitting in an open Chariot, a Crown on his Head and a Sword in his Hand. Rays from a Pillar of Fire in the Clouds reaching to Moses, to express that he acts by Command of the Deity.&quot; Motto, &quot;Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.&quot;

Jefferson suggested a depiction of the Children of Israel in the wilderness, led by a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night for the front of the seal; and Hengest and Horsa, the two brothers who were the legendary leaders of the first Anglo-Saxon settlers in Britain, for the reverse side of the seal. Adams chose a painting known as the &quot;Judgment of Hercules&quot; where the young Hercules must choose to travel either on the flowery path of self-indulgence or the rugged, more difficult, uphill path of duty to others and honor to himself.

In August 1776, du Simitière showed his design, which was more along conventional heraldic lines. The shield had six sections, each representing &quot;the Countries from which these States have been peopled&quot; (using the symbols for England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, and Holland), surrounded by the initials of all thirteen states. The supporters were a female figure representing Liberty holding an anchor of hope and a spear with a cap, and on the other side an American soldier holding a rifle and tomahawk. The crest was the &quot;Eye of Providence in a radiant Triangle whose Glory extends over the Shield and beyond the Figures&quot;, and the motto &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; (Out of Many, One) in a scroll at the bottom.

On August 20, 1776, the committee presented their report to Congress. The committee members chose du Simitière&#x27;s design, though it was changed to remove the anchor of hope and replace the soldier with Lady Justice holding a sword and a balance. Surrounding the main elements was the inscription &quot;Seal of the United States of America MDCCLXXVI&quot;. For the reverse, Franklin&#x27;s design of Moses parting the Red Sea was used. Congress was however not impressed, and on the same day ordered that the report &quot;lie on the table&quot;, ending the work of the committee.
While the designs in their entirety were not used, the &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; motto was chosen for the final seal, and the reverse used the Roman numeral for 1776 and the Eye of Providence. Jefferson also liked Franklin&#x27;s motto so much, he ended up using it on his personal seal.

The motto was almost certainly taken from the title page of &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, a monthly magazine published in London which had used it from its first edition in 1731, and was well known in the colonies. The motto alluded to the magazine being a collection of articles obtained from other newspapers, and was used in most of its editions until 1833. The motto was taken in turn from &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, a similar magazine which ran briefly from 1692 to 1694. While variants turn up in other places (for example a poem often ascribed to Virgil called &quot;Moretum&quot; contains the phrase &quot;E Pluribus Unus&quot;), this is the oldest known use of the exact phrase. Another source was some of the Continental currency issued earlier in 1776; these were designed by Franklin and featured the motto &quot;We Are One&quot; surrounded by thirteen rings, each with the name of a colony. This design is echoed in the seal submitted by the first committee, and the motto was quite possibly a Latin version of this concept.

The Eye of Providence had been a well-known classical symbol of the deity since at least the Renaissance, which du Simitiere was familiar with.

===Second committee===

For three and a half years no further action was taken, during which time the Continental Congress was forced out of Philadelphia before returning in 1778. On March 25, 1780, a second committee to design a great seal was formed, which consisted of James Lovell, John Morin Scott, and William Churchill Houston. Like the first committee, they sought the help of someone more experienced in heraldry, this time Francis Hopkinson, who did most of the work.

Hopkinson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, designed the American flag, and also helped design state and other government seals. He made two similar proposals, each having an obverse and reverse side, with themes of war and peace.

Hopkinson&#x27;s first design had a shield with thirteen diagonal red and white stripes, supported on one side by a figure bearing an olive branch and representing peace, and on the other an Indian warrior holding a bow and arrow, and holding a quiver. The crest was a radiant constellation of thirteen stars. The motto was &quot;Bello vel pace paratus&quot;, meaning &quot;prepared in war or in peace&quot;. The reverse, in Hopkinson&#x27;s words, was &quot;Liberty is seated in a chair holding an olive branch and her staff is topped by a Liberty cap. The motto &#x27;Virtute perennis&#x27; means &#x27;Everlasting because of virtue.&#x27; The date in Roman numerals is 1776.&quot;
In his second proposal, the Indian warrior was replaced by a soldier holding a sword, and the motto was shortened to &quot;Bello vel paci&quot;, meaning &quot;For war or for peace&quot;.

The committee chose the second version, and reported back to Congress on May 10, 1780, six weeks after being formed. Their final blazon, printed in Congress journals on May 17, was: &quot;The Shield charged on the Field Azure with 13 diagonal stripes alternate rouge and argent. Supporters; dexter, a Warriour holding a Sword; sinister, a Figure representing Peace bearing an Olive Branch. The Crest; a radiant Constellation of 13 Stars. The motto, Bella vel Paci.&quot; Once again, Congress did not find the result acceptable. They referred the matter back to the committee, which did no further work on the matter.

As with the first design, several elements were eventually used in the final seal; the thirteen stripes on the shield with their colors, the constellation of stars surrounded by clouds, the olive branch, and the arrows (from Hopkinson&#x27;s first proposal). Hopkinson had previously used the constellation and clouds on a $40 Continental currency note he designed in 1778. The same note also used an Eye of Providence, taken from the first committee&#x27;s design.

The shield of the Great Seal has seven white stripes and six red ones—essentially, a white background with six red stripes. Hopkinson incorporated this stripe arrangement into the Great Seal from the Flag of the United States that he had designed. Hopkinson also designed a seal for the Admiralty (Navy), which incorporated a chevron consisting of seven red stripes and six white ones. The seven red stripes in his Admiralty seal reflected the number of red stripes in his Naval flag. When Hopkinson designed these flags, he was running the Navy as chairman of the Continental Navy Board.

===Third committee===

After two more years, Congress formed a third committee on May 4, 1782, this time consisting of John Rutledge, Arthur Middleton, and Elias Boudinot. Arthur Lee replaced Rutledge, although he was not officially appointed. As with the previous two committees, most of the work was delegated to a heraldic expert, this time 28-year-old William Barton.

Barton drew a design very quickly, using a rooster on the crest, but it was much too complex. No drawing of this design seems to have survived.
Barton then came up with another design, which the committee submitted back to Congress on May 9, 1782, just five days after being formed. This time, the figures on each side of the shield were the &quot;Genius of the American Confederated Republic&quot; represented by a maiden, and on the other side an American warrior. At the top is an eagle and on the pillar in the shield is a &quot;Phoenix in Flames&quot;. The mottos were &quot;In Vindiciam Libertatis&quot; (In Defense of Liberty) and &quot;Virtus sola invicta&quot; (Only virtue unconquered).

For the reverse, Barton used a pyramid of thirteen steps, with the radiant Eye of Providence overhead, and used the mottos &quot;Deo Favente&quot; (&quot;With God favoring&quot;) and &quot;Perennis&quot; (Everlasting). The pyramid had come from another Continental currency note designed in 1778 by Hopkinson, this time the $50 note, which had a nearly identical pyramid and the motto &quot;Perennis&quot;. Barton had at first specified &quot;on the Summit of it a Palm Tree, proper&quot;, with the explanation that &quot;The Palm Tree, when burnt down to the very Root, naturally rises fairer than ever,&quot; but later crossed it out and replaced it with the Eye of Providence, taken from the first committee&#x27;s design.

Congress again took no action on the submitted design.

===Final design===
On June 13, 1782, the Congress turned to its Secretary Charles Thomson, and provided all material submitted by the first three committees. Thomson was 53 years old, and had been a Latin master at a Philadelphia academy. Thomson took elements from all three previous committees, coming up with a new design which provided the basis for the final seal.

Thomson used the eagle—this time specifying an American bald eagle—as the sole supporter on the shield. The shield had thirteen stripes, this time in a chevron pattern, and the eagle&#x27;s claws held an olive branch and a bundle of thirteen arrows. For the crest, he used Hopkinson&#x27;s constellation of thirteen stars. The motto was &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot;, taken from the first committee, and was on a scroll held in the eagle&#x27;s beak.

An eagle holding symbols of war and peace has a long history, and also echoed the second committee&#x27;s themes. Franklin owned a 1702 emblem book, which included an eagle with olive branch and arrows near its talons, which may have been a source for Thomson. The arrows also mirror those in the arms of the Dutch Republic, the only country in Europe with a representative government at the time, which depicted a lion holding seven arrows representing their seven provinces. State currency may have provided further inspiration; a 1775 South Carolina bill showed a bundle of 13 arrows and a 1775 Maryland note depicted a hand with an olive branch of 13 leaves.
For the reverse, Thomson essentially kept Barton&#x27;s design, but re-added the triangle around the Eye of Providence and changed the mottos to &quot;Annuit Cœptis&quot; and &quot;Novus Ordo Seclorum&quot;. Thomson sent his designs back to Barton, who made some final alterations. The stripes on the shield were changed again, this time to &quot;palewise&quot; (vertical), and the eagle&#x27;s wing position was changed to &quot;displayed&quot; (wingtips up) instead of &quot;rising&quot;. Barton also wrote a more properly heraldic blazon.

The design was submitted to Congress on June 20, 1782, and was accepted the same day. Thomson included a page of explanatory notes, but no drawing was submitted. This remains the official definition of the Great Seal today.
The first brass die was cut sometime between June and September, and placed in the State House in Philadelphia. It was first used by Thomson on September 16, 1782, to verify signatures on a document which authorized George Washington to negotiate an exchange of prisoners.

Charles Thomson, as the secretary of Congress, remained the keeper of the seal until the federal government was formed in 1789. On July 24, 1789, President Washington asked Thomson to deliver the seal to the Department of Foreign Affairs in the person of Roger Alden, who kept it until the Department of State was created. All subsequent secretaries of state have been responsible for applying the seal to diplomatic documents.

On September 15, 1789, the United States Congress ordered &quot;that the seal heretofore used by the United States in Congress assembled, shall be, and hereby is declared to be, the seal of the United States.&quot;

==Notable depictions==
The Great Seal very quickly became a popular symbol of the country. It inspired both the flag of North Dakota and that of the US Virgin Islands (adopted in 1911 and 1921, respectively). Combined with the heraldic tradition of artistic freedom so long as the particulars of the blazon are followed, a wide variety of official and unofficial emblazonments appeared, especially in the first hundred years. This is evident even in the different versions of the seal die. The quality of the 1885 design, coupled with a spirit of bureaucratic standardization that characterized that era, has driven most of these out of official use. 

The Great Seal symbol (or a close variant) has been used by former presidents after leaving office. In February 2021, the Seal continued to feature in the logo of the Office of Barack and Michelle Obama, and the logo of the Office of George W. Bush.

<text>Neve Shalom (), also known as Wahat as-Salam () is a cooperative village in Israel, jointly founded by Israeli Jews and Arabs in an attempt to show that the two peoples can live side by side peacefully, as well as to conduct educational work for peace, equality and understanding between the two peoples. The village is located on one of the two Latrun hilltops overlooking the Ayalon Valley, and lies midway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Falling under the jurisdiction of Mateh Yehuda Regional Council, in it had a population of .

==History==
The name &quot;Neve Shalom&quot; is taken from a passage in the Isaiah 32:18: &quot;My people shall dwell in an oasis of peace&quot;.

The village was the brainchild of Father Bruno Hussar. Born in Egypt the son of non-practicing Jews, he converted to Christianity while studying engineering in France. Witnessing at first hand the vitriolic antisemitism of wartime France sharpened his awareness of his Jewish roots. He joined the Dominican Order, was ordained into the priesthood in 1950, and sent to Jerusalem to establish a centre for Jewish studies in 1953, where he obtained Israeli citizenship in 1966. In 1970, in order to promote ecumenical interfaith dialogue, he obtained forty hectares (120 acres) of terrain classified as no man&#x27;s land in the Latrun salient, at a &#x27;peppercorn rent&#x27; of 3 pence a year on a 100-year lease from the local Trappist abbey. The area was desolate, treeless, unwatered and covered with brambles, and had not been under cultivation since the Byzantine period. At the outset foreigners came to share the experience with him, but few remained beyond one or two months, save for Anne LeMeignon who settled in a hut and stayed on.

Hussar&#x27;s project envisaged the creation of a sociocultural framework that would enable residents to live on terms of equality and mutual respect while conserving the distinct cultural heritage, language and sense of identity each individual brought to the community from the complex mosaic of Palestine&#x27;s historic communities. At the same time, it would be designed to function as a school of peace where people from all over the country could learn to listen to each other.

In Hussar&#x27;s own words:
&quot;We had in mind a small village composed of inhabitants from different communities in the country. Jews, Christians and Muslims would live there in peace, each one faithful to his own faith and traditions, while respecting those of others. Each would find in this diversity a source of personal enrichment.&quot;.
Conditions were harsh, and at first Hussar lived in a bus on the site. Even basic facilities like a bathroom were lacking, and showers could be taken only by driving once a week the to kibbutz Nachshon. The first five families, four Jewish and one Palestinian settled there in 1978, dwelling in tents. Among the early members (from November 1980) was Major Wellesley Aron, grandfather of the Israeli singer David Broza. Says David Broza: &quot;The group of people that my grandfather joined saw the place as an opportunity to expand on the idea of finding peace within yourself as a prelude to bringing peace to the community and the region&quot;. The School for Peace was established in 1978. The founding families came mainly from a secular background. The Neve Shalom-Wahat as-Salam model earned both the 1989 Beyond War Award, and a Giraffe Heroes Award, and inspired the 1992 birth of the sustained Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue Group in the United States.
For years it survived as an orphan community devoid of official assistance. In 1994, after lobbying by foreign supporters and the American diplomat Samuel W. Lewis, the Israeli government had a change of heart and began to provide subsidies, and extended legal status to the village as a municipality. As a result, it earned autonomous zoning rights. The &quot;School of Peace&quot; closed down in a month-long strike, in protest and mourning, at the outbreak of the Al Aqsa Intifada in 2000, and made efforts to provide welfare for Palestinians as the violence spread.

While assimilation is not promoted, intermarriage is not disapproved of, though instances are rare. The preference is for each community to maintain its distinct identity. The forging of a convivial bicultural identity has not erased difficulties. Even in schooling, Grace Feuerverger&#x27;s account documents, achingly painful tensions do arise in relationships as children, teachers and families interact. One resident stated the issue in the following terms:
The Neve Shalom/Wahat Al-Salam experience &quot;humanizes&quot; the conflict. It is called an oasis, but only as compared to other areas in the country. The village has many difficulties but at least we are not being broken. We do have personal squabbles as in any village, but we are living the conflict instead of fighting it.

To mark the advent of the new millennium, towards the end of the 1990s the Trappist monastery decided to hand over half the land, some , to Neve Shalom/Wahat as-Salam as an outright gift to its residents.

In May 2010, a sign was posted outside the village decrying the deaths of human rights activists during the Gaza flotilla raid. The wording of the sign originally described the deaths as &quot;murder&quot; but was subsequently changed to &quot;killing&quot; to better reflect the village consensus. The following month &quot;Arutz Sheva&quot; reported that a rift had broken out between Jews and Arabs over this issue and threats had been made to expel the Jewish residents. On its website, the community wrote that the initiative was undertaken and authorized democratically by both Jewish and Palestinian members of the village. In July of the same year, the community organized a joint Jewish-Palestinian conference on human rights which was attended by speakers ranging from Gideon Levy to Neve Gordon and Ziv Hadas, Executive Director for Physicians for Human Rights.

In a price tag attack in 2012, the tires of 14 vehicles were punctured and some of the vehicles were painted with anti-Palestinian graffiti.” 

==Demographics==

The village is home (as of 2010) to some sixty families. By principle, half of the inhabitants are Jews, the rest are Muslim and Christian Israeli Arabs. Another 300 Jewish and Arab families remain on the waiting list for settlement in the community. A recently approved expansion plan will permit the village to grow in coming years by another 92 housing lots. Since its founding, the village has had a regular rotation of international volunteers brought in to provide basic support functions at its various facilities.

==Administrative structure==
The community is run by a steering committee or secretariat which, like its subcommittees, is elected by an annual democratic vote. The head of the secretariat effectively serves as the mayor of the village. In addition there are several internal committees to run the various activities of the village. A numerical balance is consistently observed between Jewish and Arab representatives. Rotation however is not observed, and since 1995 the village administrator has always been an Arab. Jewish classes in the village school each have both a Jewish and an Arab teacher, but this does not extend to the curriculum, where maths, for example, is taught to children in their respective native languages. When matters of principle are on the agenda, a , made up of all full members of the village, is constituted to deliberate, and its final decisions are binding on everyone. Since the adult Jewish residents are not equally fluent in Arabic, the minutes of official deliberations are taken down in Hebrew and workshops are conducted in Hebrew to account for what Rabah Halabi describes as a large gap between &quot;proclaimed policy and the actual situation,&quot; and Feuerverger, using the theories of Paolo Freire, illustrates that language issues refract problems of power.

==Education==
According to Grace Feuerverger, Neve Shalom/Wahat as-Salam&#x27;s emancipatory education &#x27;has become a global role model of intercultural harmony, of teaching and learning to live together in peace.&#x27;
There are three educational institutions in the village;
*A bi-national, bi-lingual (Arabic–Hebrew) children&#x27;s educational framework, from preschool to eighth grade, with an enrollment (2009–2010) of 250. About 90% of the pupils come from towns and villages in a radius of Neve Shalom ~ Wahat as-Salam. The largest unit in the children&#x27;s educational framework is the primary school, founded in 1984 as the first such bi-national school in the country. Today, the school is recognized and receives some support from the state.
*The School for Peace: a unique educational institution offering Jewish-Arab encounter programs in the spirit of Neve Shalom ~ Wahat as-Salam. Founded in 1979, the SFP has conducted workshops, seminars and courses for some 35,000 youth and adults from Israel and the Palestinian territories. The School for Peace also trains facilitators in conflict-group encounter skills. Its teachers workshop has obtained accreditation from the Ministry of Education for in-service training.
*The Pluralistic Spiritual Centre in Memory of Bruno Hussar, known as the &quot;House of Silence&quot; (&quot;Beit Dumia/Bayt Sakinah&quot;), is a place and a framework for spiritual reflection on issues at the core of the Middle East conflict and the search for its resolution. The Centre conducts a variety of activities and seminars that are open to the general public. Muslims conduct Friday prayers, Jews, Sabbath services, and Christians worship there on Sundays.

==Economy and culture==
The village also has a small guest house, offering programs aimed at acquainting local or foreign groups with the village and its cultural context. On June 22, 2006, Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters played a live concert at the village, attracting over 50,000 fans.

The Neve Shalom project has drawn a wide range of evaluations: some hail its exemplary function as a regional model for co-existence, while others dismiss the experiment. In the Middle East Quarterly in 1998, Joseph Montville took it as &#x27;encouraging evidence of a genuine, grass-roots peace process.&#x27; Documenting its extensive work in networking to teach and train students from schools and universities on both sides of the border, he cited it as an effective part of two-track diplomacy, while noting that both religious and secular extremists from both sides prefer no contact with the &quot;other&quot;, and other Israelis, while not dismissive, regard it as a naïve, impractical fantasy. Edward Alexander, in reply, dismissed Montville&#x27;s positive assessment. Building bridges between Jews and Arabs for mutual understanding ignores the fact, he argues, that both are fully cognizant of each other, with Arabs denying Jewish sovereignty while Jews refuse to renounce it. Neve Shalom can only exist if Jews suppress their Zionism in an act of self-abasement similar to that of the &#x27;trembling ghetto Jew&#x27;, while Arabs observe the deference gleefully. Montville&#x27;s evidence shows a case where a Jewish boy absorbed guilt in an act of &#x27;prodigious sympathy&#x27; while his Palestinian counterpart exuded rage. What is forgotten, he concluded, is that &#x27;it was not the Israeli occupation that led to Arab hatred, but Arab hatred and aggression that led to that occupation.&#x27; Ahmad Yusuf, director of a U.S.-based Islamist think tank, emphasizes the limits of dialogue concerning reciprocal negative stereotypes. One weeps at Neve Shalom, he notes. Addressing security concerns through techniques of crisis resolution and social psychology, however, is not sufficient. Real success, in Palestinian terms, would consist of problem-solving focused not only on security, but also justice and equality. Optimally this requires a federal binational state. Yusuf concluded with the citation of an Arab proverb. In it a boy notices a butcher weeping as he slaughters a lamb. His father tells him to focus not on the tears, but the knife in his hand.

H. Svi Shapiro assesses Neve Shalom&#x27;s aspirations to provide a civic achievement of citizens enjoying equal status and rights, and concludes that &quot;Neve Shalom/Wahat Al-Salam provides no definitive solution to this conundrum. It does allow us, however, to see how one group of courageous, idealistic, and thoughtful individuals is struggling to mediate the tensions inherent in this situation.&quot;

<text>The Western Baseball League was an independent baseball league based in the Western United States and Western Canada. Its member teams were not associated with any Major League Baseball teams. It operated from 1995 to 2002.
The league was founded in 1994 by Portland, Oregon, businessman Bruce L. Engel. It began play in 1995, with the following teams:

Northern Division:
*Bend Bandits
*Grays Harbor Gulls
*Surrey Glaciers
*Tri-City Posse

Southern Division:
*Long Beach Barracuda
*Palm Springs Suns
*Salinas Peppers
*Sonoma County Crushers

Long Beach won the inaugural league championship, defeating Tri-City, 3 games to 1.

In 1996, Surrey folded, then the Reno Chukars were added. Long Beach won its second consecutive title, again 3 games to 1 over Tri-City.

In 1997, the league added the Chico Heat, while Palm Springs took the year off and Long Beach became the Mission Viejo Vigilantes. Chico won the league championship in its first season in the league, defeating Reno, 3–2.

In 1998, Salinas disbanded, while dormant Palm Springs moved to Oxnard, California and became the Pacific Suns. Grays Harbor suspended operations halfway through the season, and the league took over management of the team, which continued as the Western Warriors and went on an extended 68-game road trip with no home stadium. Despite the lack of a home stadium, the Warriors made it to the league championship series before being swept by Sonoma County, 3–0.

In 1999, the league disbanded the Western Warriors, while Mission Viejo, Bend, and Pacific also folded. The Sacramento Steelheads and Zion Pioneerzz were added, making the WBL a six-team league. Tri-City won the league championship for the year, 3 games to 1 over Chico.

For the 2000 season, Reno called it quits after four years in the league, while Sacramento moved to Vacaville, California and became the Solano Steelheads. The WBL was back at eight teams, however, as the Yuma (AZ) Bullfrogs, Feather River (Marysville, CA) Mudcats and Valley (Scottsdale, AZ) Vipers were added. The Zion Pioneerzz won the league championship, defeating Chico 3 games to 1.

For the 2001 season, Valley and Feather River folded, while league stalwart Tri-City defected to the Northwest League. The league returned to a market it previously served, adding the Long Beach Breakers to bring the loop back to six teams. The Zion Pioneerzz were renamed the St. George Pioneerzz. The expansion Breakers won the league championship, defeating Chico 3 games to 2.

In its final year of 2002, the Western Baseball League again operated with six teams. St. George folded, while Marysville, Calif., re-entered the league to take the Pioneerzz&#x27; place, playing the season as the Yuba-Sutter Gold Sox. The Chico Heat won the league championship in the league&#x27;s final season, defeating Long Beach 3 games to 1.

After the league folded, the western United States were without independent baseball until 2005, when former WBL cities Chico, Long Beach, and Yuma were awarded franchises in the upstart Golden Baseball League. Three of the 8 current GBL cities are former Western League markets, as Reno was added to the circuit in 2006, while St. George became a member of the league in 2007.

On September 9, 2014, it was reported that former WBL team, the Grays Harbor Gulls, would be reborn as a member of the new Mount Rainier Professional Baseball League in 2015 and would play their home games at Olympic Stadium once again. It is also mentioned that the &quot;new&quot; Gulls will have no ties to the original team. The Gulls and the MRPBL folded halfway through the inaugural season in 2015 due to financial problems.

<text>The Chico Heat is the name of two baseball teams that have operated in Chico, California. The first was a professional independent team operating in the Western Baseball League from 1997 to 2002, and the second team was an independent team operating as part of the summer collegiate wood bat league known as the Great West League, which began operations in 2014 and ceased operations in 2018. The team&#x27;s title sponsor was Golden Valley Bank. Both teams were majority owned by Steve and Kathy Nettleton.

==History==
===The original Chico Heat (1997–2002)===

The team started as a professional independent baseball team operating in Chico, California, in the Western Baseball League. They had no operating agreement with any Major League Baseball team. They were founded on July 29, 1996, by Chico Heat Professional Baseball LLC, with former supermarket entrepreneur Steve Nettleton and his wife Kathy serving as principal owners. General managers included Bob Linscheid (who would go on to become president of the WBL) and Jeff Kragel (now at Chico State University) and their mascot was the &quot;Heater The Dragon&quot; (not to be confused with the Bakersfield Blaze or Dayton Dragons mascots of the same name). The team began operations in 1997. The team immediately won the league championship in their inaugural season and, although they did not win a championship in the four subsequent years, they won the most regular season games in each of the following seasons. They appeared in the championship series in five out of their six seasons in the league. In 2002, Chico won its second league championship in the league&#x27;s and the team&#x27;s final season. After leaving the financially troubled league and after efforts to join Minor League Baseball&#x27;s Class A-Advanced California League by trying to lure the Visalia Oaks to Chico failed, the Heat ceased operations effective immediately. 

The team played at Nettleton Stadium, which is located on the campus of California State University, Chico. They were preceded by the Oroville/Chico Red Sox of the minor league&#x27;s Class-C Far West League from 1948 to 1949 and were succeeded by the Chico Outlaws of the independent Golden Baseball League, taking their place in 2005. The Heat has been the most successful professional baseball franchise in the city&#x27;s history.

On August 11, 2007, former Heat majority owner Steve Nettleton and former Heat players were honored as part of a celebration called &quot;Remember The Heat Night&quot; hosted by the Chico Outlaws as they faced the St. George RoadRunners. The original Heat mascot &quot;Heater&quot; even made an appearance. The Outlaws won the ball game in front of over 3,500 fans at Nettleton Stadium.

===The Chico Heat of the GWL (2014–2018)===

On November 25, 2014, the franchise announced its return to the field in the summer of 2016, but this time as a member of the summer collegiate wood bat league known as the Great West League. Steve Nettleton will return as a principal owner along with former Major League Baseball executive and Chico native Pat Gillick. The Heat&#x27;s beloved mascot &quot;Heater The Dragon&quot; returned to the team after a 20-year absence. They began play on the road in a loss to the rival Marysville Gold Sox. The Heat defeated the Medford Rogues 2 games to 1 to capture the inaugural GWL Championship. It is the second time in franchise history that they won a championship in their first season.

On July 24, the Heat hosted the second annual GWL All-Star Game. This year, the entire Heat team faced the best of the Great West League, a departure from the normal format. The home run derby will also take place the same day. The Heat faced the Rogues for the second straight season in the GWL Championship, this time falling to their rivals 2 games to 0. In 2018, the Heat would return to the GWL Championship, this time against the Lincoln Potters. They downed the Potters 2 games to 0 to win their second and final championship.

On October 4, 2018, the Heat GWL team announced that they were suspending operations as a result of the Great West League itself suspending operations.

<text>The Sonoma County Crushers were a minor league baseball team located in Rohnert Park, California. They were a member of the independent Western Baseball League, and were not affiliated with any Major League Baseball team.

The team was one of the founding members of the league, beginning play in 1995. They won their first and only league championship in 1998. The team folded with the league after the 2002 season. The Crushers were the only team in the WBL that remained in constant operation through the league&#x27;s eight years. At one point, former San Francisco Giants outfielder Kevin Mitchell managed the Crushers.

The team played in Rohnert Park Stadium, which was built in 1981 for the California League&#x27;s now-defunct Redwood Pioneers. The team mascot was Crusher, the &quot;Abominable Sonoman&quot;, with large purple feet for stomping grapes, in reference to the surrounding Wine Country region.

The team produced one notable professional baseball player in Chad Zerbe, who pitched for the San Francisco Giants from 2000–2003, including three appearances in the 2002 World Series against the Anaheim Angels. He was credited with a win in Game 5.

<text>The Yuba-Sutter Gold Sox were a summer collegiate wood-bat baseball club based in Marysville, California, in the United States, that began as an independent professional team in 1995. They played their home games at Bryant Field, adjacent to Ellis Lake, in Marysville from 2002 to 2022. The team name was changed to the Marysville Gold Sox in 2010 to more particularly identify the city in which the team was located, but had since reverted to &quot;Yuba-Sutter&quot;.

The Gold Sox name was chosen in honor of Yuba-Sutter (two adjoining counties separated by a river with the towns of Marysville and Yuba City on each side), having been called the &quot;Gateway to the Gold Fields&quot; during the California gold rush of the mid-1800s. The Gold Sox mascot is Mr. G, a gecko-like creature that is a favorite with children.

The Gold Sox ceased operations and were replaced by the Marysville Drakes of the Pecos League.

==Team history==

===Professional team===

====Western Baseball League (2002)====
The franchise began as a professional team in the Western Baseball League in 1995 as the Surrey Glaciers and only played one season at Stetson Bowl in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. In 1996 they relocated to Reno, Nevada, becoming known as the Reno Chukars and played their home games at Moana Stadium. They changed their name to the Reno Blackjacks in 1999 and played their final season in Reno before relocating to Marysville, where they were renamed the Feather River Mudcats for their inaugural 2000 season in Marysville.

Because of the team&#x27;s infringement on the previously trademarked name of Mudcats by the Carolina Mudcats of the Southern League, the Feather River Mudcats changed their name to the Feather River Fury in preparation for the 2001 season, though never took the field under that name since the team filed for bankruptcy prior to the season start. There was no baseball in Marysville for the 2001 season.
The City of Marysville stepped in to operate the team for the 2002 season in order to keep baseball alive in the area and the city-owned ballpark in use. The City changed the name to Yuba-Sutter Gold Sox and played the season in the Western Baseball League. Upon conclusion of that 2002 season the Western Baseball League disbanded, thus ending the Gold Sox as a professional team.

===Collegiate Summer Baseball===
The team was purchased from the City in 2003 by Bob Bavasi of Bavasi Sports Partners and local auto dealer Don McCullough (1936–2005) and began 2003 season play as a summer collegiate wood-bat team as it remains to this day.

The ball club played the 2003 and 2004 seasons in the California Collegiate League.

In 2005, the Gold Sox became the host team for the Horizon Air Summer Series, a collegiate wood bat league created by Bob Bavasi.

Prior to the 2005 season, Don McCullough died. Upon McCullough&#x27;s death, Peter Bavasi, former General Manager of the San Diego Padres, President of the Toronto Blue Jays and Cleveland Indians, came out of retirement to help administer the club for the 2005 and 2006 seasons.

On January 1, 2007, Bob Bavasi invited Fair Oaks attorney Tom Lininger and his wife Karyn to join in the ownership of the club as majority shareholders. The team was renamed the Marysville Gold Sox in 2010. Tom Lininger became the team&#x27;s managing partner and sold the team after the 2014 season.

====Great West League (2016-2018)====
In 2015, the organization was sold to CSH Holdings, Pat Gillick, Kevin Knight and Jake Knight. In 2016, the team moved to the Great West League which played a balanced schedule home and away. The League and team conduct operations like a class A short season minor league baseball team (examples: New York-Penn League and Northwest League). The ownership group hired veteran general manager Michael Mink to handle the operation in November 2016.

On November 6, 2017, the Gold Sox management announced that they were reverting the team name back to the Yuba-Sutter Gold Sox after the originally-named professional team.

On October 4, 2018, the Gold Sox announced that they are considering options for 2019 and beyond as a result of the Great West League suspending operations. On November 15, 2018, the Gold Sox announced that they would cease operations if new ownership was not found.

====Golden State Collegiate Baseball League (2019)====
In 2019, a new local group, YCM Baseball Group, LLC, led by local agricultural entrepreneur Al Montna, purchased the Gold Sox and became members of the Golden State Collegiate Baseball League joining former GWL rivals the Medford Rogues.

====Montna Farms Summer Series (2020-2022)====
In 2020, the Gold Sox season in the GSCBL was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, they helped create a smaller short-season league known as the Sierra Central-Montna Farms Summer Series. The Gold Sox were the inaugural champions defeating the Lincoln Potters (Note: The Potters are members of the CCL and did not know or agree to be a part of the Montna Farms Summer Series). The Series launched its second season in 2021, which they named themselves champions once again. In 2022, the series name was shortened to the Montna Farms Summer Series. Also in 2022, the Gold Sox joined the Bay Area Collegiate League.

===Post-Gold Sox baseball in Marysville===
On September 7, 2022, the Gold Sox announced that they will not be taking to the field in 2023 and will reevaluate their position in summer collegiate baseball in the region. They are officially considering themselves &quot;on hiatus&quot;, though they have effectively ceased operations. They were replaced by the new Marysville Drakes of the Pecos League in 2023. However, they, too, would fold after two seasons when the Pecos League left them off of the schedule. &quot;They&quot; would be replaced in 2025 by the Yuba-Sutter High Wheelers of the Pioneer League, an independent minor league partnered with Major League Baseball and defending league champions relocated from Davis, California.

==Bryant Field==

Since their inception, the Gold Sox have played their home games at what was originally known as Bryant Field, located along Highway 70 in the east part of Marysville. It has experienced several name changes since then, including Appeal-Democrat Park, All Seasons RV Stadium, Colusa Casino Stadium and Hard Rock Park. The stadium is once again known as Bryant Field. The Gold Sox shared their field with the Yuba City Bears, who joined the GWL in 2017, then later folded their GWL operations.

<text>The Long Beach Breakers were a minor league baseball team that played at Blair Field in Long Beach, California. They played in the independent Western Baseball League since 1978 and were not associated with any Major League Baseball team.

The Breakers were founded in 2001 and owned by Jerry Schoenfeld a California Businessman, The Breakers won a league championship in their 2001 inaugural season. They played for two seasons and were coached by Dodger Catcher Steve Yeager. The talented staff of coaches consisted of (Bench and Hitting Coach) Joe Magno former associate scout for the Cincinnati Reds and college baseball coach along with (pitching coaches) John Curtis California Angels and George Throop Kansas City Royals. The team&#x27;s success was unprecedented as a new franchise and had talented player like Matt Luke, Marc Gutfeld, Doug Grabek and pitcher Ritchie Linares helping the team to the title. Unfortunately the team was forced to fold along with the league after the 2002 season. The team was replaced in 2005 by the Golden Baseball League&#x27;s Long Beach Armada.

<doc id="65519" wikidata="Q7555721" url="?curid=65519" title="Solano Steelheads">
<text>The Solano Steelheads were a minor league baseball team in Vacaville, California. They played in the independent Western Baseball League and were not affiliated with any Major League Baseball team, although four of the players in the 2002 season were mayoral candidates in the Golden One Bank Capital Election.

The Steelheads were founded in 1999 as the Sacramento Steelheads by a businessman, Bruce Portner. They played their inaugural season at Sacramento City College. Portner sought to attract attention to the new franchise by hiring the notorious MLB star Pete Rose as &quot;the hitting instructor&quot; of the team. 

The Steelheads were relatively successful in the WBL standings in 1999. Sacramento&#x27;s sports fans largely chose to ignore the home venue, which was located on the college grounds, and hence, prevented from serving alcohol. Many area baseball fans were content to wait for the relocation of the Pacific Coast League Vancouver Canadians to Raley Field.

Rather than contend directly with AAA-level baseball, Portner moved his team west to Vacaville, where he built Travis Credit Union Park on the grounds of the historic Nut Tree. Marketing efforts portrayed the team as a Rockwellian slice of Americana, and Solano County fans responded positively to a professional team of their own. The 2000 and 2001 seasons were successful, in terms of both attendance and profit. 2001 saw a renovation of Travis Credit Union Park that included replacing benches with bucket seating. The ballpark was further improved by the start of the 2002 season with a new permanent concession facility and picnic area.

Due to the City of Vacaville&#x27;s failure to honor the promised removal of a significant financial condition imposed on Portner when he built the stadium with his own money, Portner was forced to sell the stadium at a fire sale price and ultimately had to place the team in bankruptcy to reorganize its debts. 

Legal issues and financial obligations became overwhelming and coupled with the decline of the Sonoma County Crushers, another of the WBL flagship organizations, the Western Baseball League was dealt a critical blow, and folded shortly after the 2002 season. 

The Solano Thunderbirds, a college league team succeeded the Steelheads as Travis Credit Union Park&#x27;s primary tenant but has never shared in the excitement or crowds enjoyed by Portner&#x27;s Steelheads drawing fewer than 100 people to most of its games.

Due to the poor management of the Solano Thunderbirds owned by Curtis, Susan and Byrant Stocking, they ran up a debt of millions of dollars and were forced to close down the Thunderbirds leaving Vacaville with no baseball team.

<doc id="65521" wikidata="Q311161" url="?curid=65521" title="Jesse Ventura">
<text>Jesse Ventura (born James George Janos; July 15, 1951) is an American politician, actor, and retired professional wrestler. After achieving fame in the World Wrestling Federation, he served as the 38th governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003. He was elected governor with the Reform Party and is the party&#x27;s only candidate to win a major government office.

Ventura was a member of the United States Navy Underwater Demolition Team during the Vietnam War. After leaving the military, he embarked on a professional wrestling career as a heel from 1975 to 1986, taking the ring name &quot;Jesse &#x27;the Body&#x27; Ventura.&quot; He had a lengthy tenure in the WWF/WWE as a performer and color commentator and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004. In addition to wrestling, Ventura pursued an acting career, appearing in films such as &quot;Predator&quot; and &quot;The Running Man&quot;.

Ventura entered politics in 1991 when he was elected mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, a position he held until 1995. He was the Reform Party candidate in the 1998 Minnesota gubernatorial election, running a low-budget campaign centered on grassroots events and unusual advertising that urged citizens not to &quot;vote for politics as usual&quot;. Initially ignored as a novelty candidate, Ventura defeated both the Democratic and the Republican nominee, a major upset. Amid internal fights for control over the party, Ventura left the Reform Party a year after taking office and served the remainder of his term as a member of the Independence Party of Minnesota. Since holding public office, Ventura has referred to himself as a &quot;statesman&quot; instead of a politician.

As governor, Ventura oversaw reforms of Minnesota&#x27;s property tax as well as the state&#x27;s first sales tax rebate. Other initiatives he took included construction of the METRO Blue Line light rail in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area and income tax cuts. Ventura did not run for reelection. After leaving office in 2003, he became a visiting fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government. He has since hosted a number of political television shows on RT America and Ora TV, and written several books. Ventura has been a prominent figure in third-party politics, having repeatedly floated the idea of running for President of the United States as an independent candidate.

In late April 2020, Ventura endorsed the Green Party in the 2020 presidential election and showed interest in running for its nomination. He officially joined the Green Party of Minnesota on May 2. On May 7, he confirmed he would not run. The Green Party of Alaska nominated Ventura, without his involvement, causing the national Green Party to disassociate itself from the Alaska party for abandoning the national party&#x27;s nominee, Howie Hawkins.

==Early life==
Ventura was born James George Janos on July 15, 1951, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of George William Janos and his wife, Bernice Martha (née Lenz). Both his parents were World War II veterans. His mother was the chief nurse anesthetist at North Memorial Hospital and his father worked for the Minneapolis Street Department.

Ventura has an older brother, Jan, who similarly served in the Vietnam War as a UDT. Jan and Jesse graduated as members of BUD/S classes 49 and 58, respectively. Ventura has described himself as Slovak since his father&#x27;s parents were from Slovakia; his mother was of German descent. Ventura was raised as a Lutheran. Born in South Minneapolis &quot;by the Lake Street bridge&quot;, he attended Cooper Elementary School, Sanford Junior High School, and graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1969. Roosevelt High School inducted Ventura into its first hall of fame in September 2014.

Ventura served in the United States Navy from December 1, 1969, to September 10, 1975, during the Vietnam War, but did not see combat. He graduated in BUD/S class 58 in December 1970 and was part of Underwater Demolition Team 12.

Ventura has frequently referred to his military career in public statements and debates. He was criticized by hunters and conservationists for saying in a 2001 interview with the Minneapolis &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, &quot;Until you have hunted men, you haven&#x27;t hunted yet.&quot;

===Post-Navy===
Near the end of his Navy service, Ventura began to spend time with the &quot;South Bay&quot; chapter of the Mongols Motorcycle Club in San Diego. He would ride onto Naval Base Coronado on his Harley-Davidson wearing his Mongol &quot;colors&quot;. According to Ventura, he was a &quot;full-patch&quot; member of the club and third-in-command of his chapter, but never had any problems with the authorities. His biker nickname was &quot;Superman&quot;. In the fall of 1974, Ventura left the bike club to return to the Twin Cities. Shortly after that, the Mongols entered into open warfare with their biker rivals, the Hells Angels. In November 2018, Ventura testified as an expert witness on behalf of the Mongols in a federal racketeering trial in Santa Ana, California, defending the club against the government&#x27;s allegations characterizing the Mongols as a criminal enterprise. He testified that he remained an inactive member of the Mongols and called his time as an active member of the club&#x27;s San Diego chapter &quot;a stepping stone I needed to make the transition from military life back to civilian life. I owe them for being there for me when the rest of the world wasn&#x27;t&quot;.

Ventura attended North Hennepin Community College in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, during the mid-1970s on the G.I. Bill. At the same time, he began weightlifting and wrestling and became a member of the Japan Karate Association. He was a bodyguard for The Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead for a time before entering professional wrestling and adopting the wrestling name Jesse Ventura.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career===

Ventura created the stage name Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura to go with the persona of a bully-ish beach bodybuilder, picking the name &quot;Ventura&quot; from a map as part of his &quot;bleach blond from California&quot; gimmick. As a wrestler, Ventura performed as a heel, a decision he attributes to his ability to be more creative as a villain. He resurrected Gorgeous George&#x27;s old motto of &quot;Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat!&quot;, which he emblazoned on his t-shirts. Much of this flamboyant persona was adapted from &quot;Superstar&quot; Billy Graham, a charismatic and popular performer during the 1970s.

In 1975, Ventura made his debut in the Central States territory, before moving to the Pacific Northwest, where he wrestled for promoter Don Owen as Jesse &quot;The Great&quot; Ventura. During his stay in Portland, Oregon, he had notable feuds with Dutch Savage and Jimmy Snuka and won the Pacific Northwest Wrestling title twice (once from each wrestler) and the tag team title five times (twice each with Bull Ramos and &quot;Playboy&quot; Buddy Rose, and once with Jerry Oates). He later moved to his hometown promotion, the American Wrestling Association in Minnesota and began teaming with Adrian Adonis as the &quot;East-West Connection&quot; in 1979. In his RF Video shoot in 2012, he revealed that shortly after he arrived in the AWA he was given the nickname &quot;the Body&quot; by Verne Gagne. The duo won the AWA World Tag Team Championship on July 20, 1980, on a when Gagne, one-half of the tag team champions along with Mad Dog Vachon, failed to show up for a title defense in Denver, Colorado. The duo held the belts for nearly a year, losing to &quot;The High Flyers&quot; (Greg Gagne and Jim Brunzell).

===Move to the WWF, retirement, and commentary===
Shortly after losing the belts, the duo moved on to the World Wrestling Federation, where they were managed by Freddie Blassie. Although the duo was unable to capture the World Tag Team Championship, both Adonis and Ventura became singles title contenders, each earning several title shots at WWF Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund.

Ventura continued to wrestle until September 1984 after three back-to-back losses to world champion Hulk Hogan, when blood clots in his lungs effectively ended his in-ring career. He claimed that the clots were a result of his exposure to Agent Orange during his time in Vietnam. Ventura returned to the ring in 1985, forming a tag-team with Randy Savage and Savage&#x27;s manager (and real-life wife) Miss Elizabeth. Often after their televised matches Ventura taunted and challenged fellow commentator Bruno Sammartino, but nothing ever came of this.

Ventura participated in a six-man tag-team match in December 1985 when he, Roddy Piper, and Bob Orton defeated Hillbilly Jim, Uncle Elmer, and Cousin Luke in a match broadcast on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event IV&quot;. The tag match against the Hillbillies came about after Piper and Orton interrupted Elmer&#x27;s wedding ceremony on the previous edition of the show; Ventura, who later claimed that he was under instruction from fellow commentator and WWF owner Vince McMahon to &quot;bury them&quot;, insulted Elmer and his wife during commentary of a real wedding ceremony at the Meadowlands Arena, by proclaiming when they kissed: &quot;It looks like two carp in the middle of the Mississippi River going after the same piece of corn.&quot; According to Ventura, the wedding was real, for at that time the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board would not allow the WWF to stage a fake wedding in the state of New Jersey, so Stan Frazier (Uncle Elmer) and his fiancee had agreed to have a real in-ring wedding.

After a failed comeback bid, Ventura hosted his own talk segment on the WWF&#x27;s &quot;All Star Wrestling&quot; TV program called &quot;The Body Shop&quot;, in much the same heel style as &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot;, though the setting was a mock gym (when Ventura was unavailable, &quot;The Body Shop&quot; was often hosted by Don Muraco). He began to do color commentary on television for &quot;All-Star Wrestling&quot;, replacing Angelo Mosca, and later &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, initially alongside Vince McMahon and the semi-retired Sammartino, and then just with McMahon after Sammartino&#x27;s departure from the WWF in early 1988. Ventura most notably co-hosted &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot; with McMahon, the first six WrestleManias (five of which were alongside Gorilla Monsoon), and most of the WWF&#x27;s pay-per-views at the time with Monsoon, with the lone exception for Ventura being the first SummerSlam, in which he served as the guest referee during the main event.

Ventura&#x27;s entertaining commentary style was an extension of his wrestling persona, i.e., a &quot;heel&quot;, as he was partial to the villains, something new and different at the time. McMahon, who was always looking for ways of jazzing things up, came up with the idea of Ventura doing heel commentary at a time when most commentators, including McMahon himself, openly favored the fan favorites.

But Ventura still occasionally gave credit where it was due, praising the athleticism of fan favorites such as Ricky Steamboat and Randy Savage, who was championed by Ventura for years, even when he was a face, a point Ventura regularly made on-air to McMahon and Monsoon. Occasionally he would even acknowledge mistakes made by the heels, including those made by his personal favorites such as Savage or wrestlers managed by heels Bobby Heenan and Jimmy Hart.

One notable exception to this rule was the WrestleMania VI Ultimate Challenge title for title match between WWF Champion Hulk Hogan and the WWF Intercontinental Champion, The Ultimate Warrior. Since they were both fan favorites, Ventura took a neutral position in his commentary, even praising Hogan&#x27;s display of sportsmanship at the end of the match when he handed over the WWF Championship belt to the Warrior after he lost the title, stating that Hogan was going out like a true champion. During the match, however, which was also the last match at WrestleMania he called, Ventura did voice his pleasure when both broke the rules, at one point claiming, &quot;This is what I like. Let the two goody two-shoes throw the rule book out and get nasty.&quot; Ventura&#x27;s praise of Hogan&#x27;s action was unusual for him, because he regularly rooted against Hogan during his matches, usually telling fellow commentator Monsoon after Hogan had won a championship match at a WrestleMania that he might &quot;come out of retirement and take this dude out&quot;.

Hogan and Ventura were at one point close friends, but Ventura abruptly ended the friendship in 1994 after he discovered, during his lawsuit against McMahon, that Hogan was the one who had told McMahon about Ventura&#x27;s attempt to form a labor union in 1986 before WrestleMania 2. After a dispute with McMahon over the use of his image for promoting a Sega product, Ventura left the WWF in August 1990.

Ventura later served as a radio announcer for a few National Football League teams, among them the Minnesota Vikings and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

In February 1992 at SuperBrawl II, Ventura joined World Championship Wrestling as a commentator. WCW President Eric Bischoff ultimately released him for allegedly falling asleep during a &quot;WCW Worldwide&quot; TV taping at Disney MGM Studios in July 1994, but it has been speculated that the move may have had more to do with Hogan&#x27;s arrival shortly before.

===Litigation===
In 1987, while negotiating his contract as a WWF commentator, Ventura waived his rights to royalties on videotape sales when he was falsely told that only feature performers received such royalties. In November 1991, having discovered that other non-feature performers received royalties, Ventura brought an action for fraud, misappropriation of publicity rights, and quantum meruit in Minnesota state court against Titan Sports, asking for $2 million (~$ in ) in royalties based on a fair market value share. Titan moved the case to federal court, and Ventura won an $801,333 jury verdict on the last claim. In addition, the judge awarded him $8,625 in back pay for all non-video WWF merchandising featuring Ventura. The judgment was affirmed on appeal, and the case,&quot; &quot;65 F.3d 725 (8th Cir.1995), is an important result in the law of restitution. As a result, Ventura&#x27;s commentary is removed on most releases from WWE Home Video.

===Return to the WWF/WWE===
In mid-1999, Ventura reappeared on WWF television during his term as governor of Minnesota, acting as the special guest referee for the main event of SummerSlam, held in Minneapolis. He continued his relationship with the WWF by doing commentary for Vince McMahon&#x27;s short-lived XFL.

On the June 4, 2001, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, which aired live from Minnesota, Ventura appeared to overrule McMahon&#x27;s authority and approve a WWF championship match between then-champion Stone Cold Steve Austin and Chris Jericho.

On the March 20, 2003, episode of &quot;SmackDown!,&quot; Ventura appeared in a taped interview to talk about the match between McMahon and Hogan at WrestleMania XIX.

On March 13, 2004, Ventura was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. The next night, at WrestleMania XX, he approached the ring to interview Donald Trump, who had a front-row seat. Trump affirmed that Ventura would receive his moral and financial support were he to reenter politics. Alluding to the 2008 election, Ventura announced, &quot;I think we oughta put a wrestler in the White House in 2008!&quot;

Ventura was guest host on the November 23, 2009, episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; during which he retained his heel persona by siding with the number one contender Sheamus over WWE Champion John Cena. This happened while he confronted Cena about how it was unfair that Cena always got a title shot in the WWE while Ventura never did during his WWE career. After that, Sheamus attacked Cena and put him through a table. Ventura then made the match a Table match at . During the show, for the first time in nearly 20 years, McMahon joined Ventura ringside to provide match commentary.

On December 14, 2024, Ventura returned to &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot;. He dual broadcast the show with Joe Tessitore and called the main event match for the Undisputed WWE Championship between Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes and Kevin Owens with Michael Cole and Pat McAfee.

On January 25, 2025, Ventura returned to Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event, again dual broadcasting the show with Joe Tessitore. He called the WWE Intercontinental Championship match between Intercontinental Champion Bron Breakker and Sheamus alongside Michael Cole and Pat MacAfee.

==Acting career==
Near the end of his wrestling career, Ventura began an acting career. He appeared in the movie &quot;Predator&quot; (1987), whose cast included future California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and future Kentucky gubernatorial candidate Sonny Landham. Ventura became close friends with Schwarzenegger during the production of &quot;Predator&quot;. He appeared in two episodes of &quot;Zorro&quot; filmed in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. He had a starring role in the 1990 sci-fi movie &quot;Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe&quot;. He had supporting roles in &quot;The Running Man&quot; (again with Schwarzenegger), &quot;No Holds Barred&quot;, &quot;Thunderground&quot;, &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, &quot;Repossessed&quot;, &quot;Ricochet&quot;, &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; (in which he steals the Liberty Bell), Ready to Rumble, and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;—the first and last of these also starring Schwarzenegger. Ventura made a cameo appearance in &quot;Major League II&quot; as &quot;White Lightning&quot;. He appeared as a self-help guru (voice only) in &quot;The Ringer&quot;, trying to turn Johnny Knoxville into a more confident worker. Ventura had a cameo in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &quot;From Outer Space&quot;&quot; as a Man in Black alongside fellow &#x27;MiB&#x27; Alex Trebek. In 2008, Ventura was in the independent comedy &quot;Woodshop&quot;, starring as high school shop teacher Mr. Madson. The film was released September 7, 2010.

===Filmography===

===Other media===
Ventura was a bodyguard for The Rolling Stones in the late 1970s and 1980s. Its lead singer, Mick Jagger, said of him, &quot;He&#x27;s done us proud, hasn&#x27;t he? He&#x27;s been fantastic.&quot;

In the late 1980s, Ventura appeared in a series of Miller Lite commercials.

In 1989, Ventura co-hosted the four episodes of the DiC Entertainment children&#x27;s program &quot;Record Breakers: World of Speed&quot; along with Gary Apple. In 1991, the pilot episode for &quot;Tag Team&quot;, a television program about two ex-professional wrestlers turned police officers, starred Ventura and Roddy Piper.

Ventura also co-hosted the short-lived syndicated game show &quot;The Grudge Match&quot; alongside sportscaster Steve Albert.

Between 1995 and 1998, Ventura had radio call-in shows on KFAN 1130 and KSTP 1500 in Minneapolis–Saint Paul. He also had a brief role on the television soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in 1999.

On April 12, 1996, Ventura starred in &quot;The X-Files&quot; Season 3 episode as a mysterious Man in Black.

Ventura has been criticized by the press for profiting from his heightened popularity. He was hired as a television analyst for the failed XFL football league in 2001, served as a referee at a WWF SummerSlam match in 1999, and published several books during his tenure as governor. On his weekly radio show, he often criticized the media for focusing on these deals rather than his policy proposals.

From 2009 to 2012, TruTV aired three seasons of the television series &quot;Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura&quot;.

Ventura had a guest spot on an episode of the 2012 rebooted &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; animated series on Nickelodeon.

In 2013, Ventura announced a new show, &quot;Jesse Ventura: Uncensored&quot;, which launched on January 27, 2014, and later renamed &quot;Off the Grid&quot;, and aired until 2016 on Ora TV, an online video on demand network founded by Larry King.

In 2017, Ventura became the host of the show &quot;The World According to Jesse&quot; on RT America; the series ended in March 2022 when RT programming produced by its production partner Ora TV was suspended after Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. RT America ceased operations on March 3, 2022.

==Political career==

===Mayor of Brooklyn Park===

After his departure from the WWF, Ventura took a former high school teacher&#x27;s advice and ran for mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, in 1990. He defeated the city&#x27;s 18-year incumbent mayor and served from 1991 to 1995. Many professional wrestling personalities have entered politics, but Ventura is among the few, including Jim Barnett and Antonio Inoki, to have remained active in wrestling while serving in a government role: he was simultaneously mayor and WCW&#x27;s color commentator through much of his mayoral tenure.

===Governor of Minnesota===
Ventura ran for governor of Minnesota in 1998 as the Reform Party of Minnesota nominee (he later joined the Independence Party of Minnesota when the Reform Party broke from its association with the Reform Party of the United States of America). His campaign consisted of a combination of aggressive grassroots events organized in part by his campaign manager Doug Friedline and original television spots, designed by quirky adman Bill Hillsman, using the phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t vote for politics as usual.&quot; He spent considerably less than his opponents (about $300,000) and was a pioneer in his using the Internet as a medium of reaching out to voters in a political campaign.

He won the election in November 1998, narrowly and unexpectedly defeating the major-party candidates, Republican St. Paul mayor Norm Coleman and Democratic-Farmer-Labor Attorney General Hubert H. &quot;Skip&quot; Humphrey III. During his victory speech, Ventura famously declared, &quot;We shocked the world!&quot; After his election, bumper stickers and T-shirts bearing the slogan &quot;My governor can beat up your governor&quot; appeared in Minnesota. The nickname &quot;Jesse &#x27;The Mind (from a last-minute Hillsman ad featuring Ventura posing as Rodin&#x27;s &quot;Thinker&quot;) began to resurface sarcastically in reference to his often controversial remarks. Ventura&#x27;s old stage name &quot;Jesse &#x27;The Body (sometimes adapted to &quot;Jesse &#x27;The Governing Body) also continued to appear with some regularity.

After a trade mission to China in 2002, Ventura announced that he would not run for a second term, saying that he no longer felt dedicated enough to his job and accusing the media of hounding him and his family for personal behavior and beliefs while neglecting coverage of important policy issues. He later told a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reporter that he would have run for a second term if he had been single, citing the media&#x27;s effect on his family life.

Ventura sparked media criticism when, nearing the end of his term, he suggested that he might resign from office early to allow his lieutenant governor, Mae Schunk, an opportunity to serve as governor. He further said that he wanted her to be the state&#x27;s first female governor and have her portrait painted and hung in the Capitol along with the other governors&#x27;. Ventura quickly retreated from the comments, saying he was just floating an idea.

====Political positions as governor====
In political debates, Ventura often admitted that he had not formed an opinion on certain policy questions. He often called himself &quot;fiscally conservative and socially liberal.&quot; He selected teacher Mae Schunk as his running mate.

Lacking a party base in the Minnesota House of Representatives and Senate, Ventura&#x27;s policy ambitions had little chance of being introduced as bills. He vetoed 45 bills in his first year, only three of which were overridden. The reputation for having his vetoes overridden comes from his fourth and final year, when six of his nine vetoes were overridden. Nevertheless, Ventura succeeded with some of his initiatives. One of the most notable was the rebate on sales tax; each year of his administration, Minnesotans received a tax-free check in the late summer. The state was running a budget surplus at the time, and Ventura believed the money should be returned.

Later, Ventura came to support a unicameral (one-house) legislature, property tax reform, gay rights, recreational marijuana, and abortion rights. While funding public school education generously, he opposed the teachers&#x27; union, and did not have a high regard for public funding of higher education institutions.

In an interview on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, he reaffirmed his support of gay rights, including marriage and military service, humorously stating he would have gladly served alongside homosexuals when he was in the Navy as they would have provided less competition for women. Later, on the subject of a 2012 referendum on amending the Minnesota Constitution to limit marriage to male-female couples, Ventura said, &quot;I certainly hope that people don&#x27;t amend our constitution to stop gay marriage because, number one, the constitution is there to protect people, not oppress them&quot;, and related a story from his wrestling days of a friend who was denied hospital visitation to his same-sex partner.

During the first part of his administration, Ventura strongly advocated for land-use reform and substantial mass transit improvements, such as light rail.

During another trade mission to Cuba in the summer of 2002, he denounced the United States embargo against Cuba, saying the embargo affected the Cuban public more than it did its government.
Ventura greatly disapproved of some of the events at the 2002 memorial for Senator Paul Wellstone, his family, and others who died in a plane crash on October 25, 2002. Ventura said, &quot;I feel used. I feel violated and duped over the fact that the memorial ceremony turned into a political rally&quot;. He left halfway through the controversial speech made by Wellstone&#x27;s best friend, Rick Kahn. Ventura had initially planned to appoint a Democrat to Wellstone&#x27;s seat, but instead appointed Dean Barkley to represent Minnesota in the Senate until Wellstone&#x27;s term expired in January 2003. Barkley was succeeded by Norm Coleman, who won the seat against Walter Mondale, who replaced Wellstone as the Democratic nominee after Wellstone died a few days before the election.
Ventura, who ran on a Reform Party ticket and advocated for a greater role for third parties in American politics, is highly critical of both Democrats and Republicans. He has called both parties &quot;monsters that are out of control&quot;, concerned only with &quot;their own agendas and their pork.&quot;

In his book &quot;Independent Nation&quot;, political analyst John Avlon calls Ventura a radical centrist thinker and activist.

====Criticisms of tenure as governor====
After the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor&#x27;s mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in Maple Grove.

In 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that &quot;the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain.&quot; The proposed petition was dismissed by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota. Under Minnesota law, the Chief Justice must review recall petitions for legal sufficiency, and, upon such review, the Chief Justice determined that it did not allege the commission of any act that violated Minnesota law. Ventura sought attorney&#x27;s fees as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous petition for recall, but that request was denied on the ground that there was no statutory authority for such an award.

Ventura was also criticized for mishandling the Minnesota state budget, with Minnesota state economist Tom Stinson noting that the statewide capital gain fell from $9 billion to $4 billion between 2000 and 2001. Ventura had vetoed this budget, but the state legislature overrode him. This deficit received national attention, for instance making a 10-question interview by &quot;Time&quot; journalist Matthew Cooper with Ventura. When Ventura left office in 2003, Minnesota had a $4.2 billion budget deficit, compared to the $3 billion budget surplus when Ventura took office in 1999.

During his tenure as governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the Twin Cities press. He called reporters &quot;media jackals,&quot; with the label &quot;Official Jackal&quot; even appearing on the press passes required to enter his press area. Shortly after Ventura&#x27;s election as governor, author and humorist Garrison Keillor wrote a satirical book about him, &quot;Me: Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente&quot;, depicting a self-aggrandizing former &quot;Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)&quot; turned professional wrestler turned politician. Ventura initially responded angrily to the satire, but later said Keillor &quot;makes Minnesota proud&quot;. During his term, Ventura appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, in which he responded controversially to the following question: &quot;So which is the better city of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis or St. Paul?&quot;. Ventura responded, &quot;Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen&quot;. He later apologized for the remark, saying it was not intended to be taken seriously.

===Consideration of bids for other political offices===

While Ventura has not held public office since the end of his term as governor in 2003, he has remained politically active and occasionally hinted at running again for political office. In an April 7, 2008, interview on CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Situation Room&quot;, Ventura said he was considering entering the race for the United States Senate seat then held by Norm Coleman, his Republican opponent in the 1998 gubernatorial race. A Twin Cities station Fox 9 poll put him at 24%, behind Democratic candidate Al Franken at 32% and Coleman at 39% in a hypothetical three-way race. On &quot;Larry King Live&quot; on July 14, 2008, Ventura said he would not run, partly out of concern for his family&#x27;s privacy. Franken won the election by a very narrow margin.

In his 1999 autobiography &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got Time to Bleed&quot;, Ventura suggested that he did not plan to run for president of the United States but did not rule it out. In 2003, he expressed interest in running for president while accepting an award from the International Wrestling Institute and Museum in Newton, Iowa. He spoke at Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul&#x27;s &quot;Rally for the Republic&quot;, organized by the Campaign for Liberty, on September 2, 2008, and implied a possible future run for president. At the end of his speech, Ventura announced if he saw that the public was willing to see a change in the direction of the country, then &quot;in 2012 we&#x27;ll give them a race they&#x27;ll never forget!&quot; In 2011, Ventura expressed interest in running with Ron Paul in the 2012 presidential election if Paul would run as an independent. On November 4, 2011, Ventura said at a press conference about the dismissal of his court case against the Transportation Security Administration for what he claimed were illegal searches of air travelers that he was &quot;thinking about&quot; running for president. Ventura was reportedly in talks with the Libertarian Party to run for president on its ticket, but party chairman Mark Hinkle said, &quot;Jesse is more interested in 2016 than he is in 2012. But I think he&#x27;s serious. If Ron Paul ran as a Libertarian, I think he definitely would be interested in running as a vice presidential candidate. He&#x27;s thinking, &#x27;If I run as the vice presidential candidate under Ron Paul in 2012, I could run as a presidential candidate in 2016&#x27;.&quot;

David Gewirtz of ZDNet wrote in a November 2011 article that he thought Ventura could win if he declared his intention to run at that point and ran a serious campaign, but that it would be a long shot.
In late 2015, Ventura publicly flirted with the idea of running for president in 2016 as a Libertarian but allowed his self-imposed deadline of May 1 to pass. He also expressed an openness to be either Donald Trump&#x27;s or Bernie Sanders&#x27;s running mate in 2016. Ventura tried to officially endorse Sanders but his endorsement was rejected. Ventura then endorsed former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee, saying, &quot;Johnson is a very viable alternative&quot; and &quot;This is the year for a third-party candidate to rise if there ever was one.&quot; Despite this, he later claimed that he ultimately voted for Green Party nominee Jill Stein.

===Unauthorized 2020 presidential campaign===
Ventura expressed interest in running for president again in 2020, but said he would do so only under the Green Party banner. &quot;The [Green Party] has shown some interest. I haven&#x27;t made a decision yet because it&#x27;s a long time off. If I do do it, Trump will not have a chance. For one, Trump knows wrestling. He participated in two WrestleManias. He knows he can never out-talk a wrestler, and he knows I&#x27;m the greatest talker wrestling&#x27;s ever had.&quot;

On April 27, 2020, Ventura submitted a letter of interest to the Green Party Presidential Support Committee, the first step to seeking the Green Party&#x27;s presidential nomination. In May, he announced that he would not run for health reasons, explaining that he would lose his employer-provided health insurance.

Ventura said he would write in his own name in the presidential election, but would support Green candidates in down-ballot races. He said he &quot;refuse[s] to vote for &#x27;the lesser of two evils&#x27; because in the end, that&#x27;s still choosing evil.&quot; Ventura received seven presidential delegate votes at the 2020 Green National Convention, having been awarded them through write-in votes in the 2020 Green primaries. Despite the national Green Party nominating Howie Hawkins for president and Angela Nicole Walker for vice president, the Green Party of Alaska nominated Ventura and former representative Cynthia McKinney without Ventura&#x27;s consent. Ventura and McKinney received 0.7% of the Alaska popular vote.

===Political views===
Ventura has described himself as &quot;fiscally conservative&quot; and &quot;socially liberal&quot;. He has said his first memory of political independence is voting for John Anderson for president in 1980.

====Bush administration and torture====
In a May 11, 2009, interview with Larry King, Ventura twice said that George W. Bush was the worst president of his lifetime, adding &quot;President Obama inherited something I wouldn&#x27;t wish on my worst enemy. You know? Two wars, an economy that&#x27;s borderline depression.&quot; On the issue of waterboarding, Ventura added:

====Questions about 9/11====
In April and May 2008, in several radio interviews for his new book &quot;Don&#x27;t Start the Revolution Without Me&quot;, Ventura expressed concern about what he called unanswered questions about 9/11. His remarks about the possibility that the World Trade Center was demolished with explosives were repeated in newspaper and television stories after some of the interviews.

On May 18, 2009, when asked by Sean Hannity of Fox News how George W. Bush could have avoided the September 11 attacks, Ventura answered, &quot;And there it is again—you pay attention to memos on August 6th that tell you exactly what bin Laden&#x27;s gonna do.&quot;

On April 9, 2011, when Piers Morgan of CNN asked Ventura for his official view of the events of 9/11, Ventura said, &quot;My theory of 9/11 is that we certainly—at the best we knew it was going to happen. They allowed it to happen to further their agenda in the Middle East and go to these wars.&quot;

==Other endeavors==
===Post-gubernatorial life===

Ventura was succeeded in office on January 6, 2003, by Republican Tim Pawlenty.

In October 2003 he began a weekly MSNBC show, &quot;Jesse Ventura&#x27;s America&quot;; the show was canceled after a couple of months. Ventura has alleged it was canceled because he opposed the Iraq War. MSNBC honored the balance of his three-year contract, legally preventing him from doing any other TV or news shows.

On October 22, 2004, with Ventura by his side, former Maine Governor Angus King endorsed John Kerry for president at the Minnesota state capitol building. Ventura did not speak at the press conference. When prodded for a statement, King responded, &quot;He plans to vote for John Kerry, but he doesn&#x27;t want to make a statement and subject himself to the tender mercies of the Minnesota press&quot;. In the 2012 Senate elections, Ventura endorsed King in his campaign for the open Senate seat in Maine, which King won.

In November 2004, an advertisement began airing in California featuring Ventura, in which he voiced his opposition to then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s policies regarding Native American casinos. Ventura served as an advisory board member for a group called Operation Truth, a nonprofit organization set up &quot;to give voice to troops who served in Iraq.&quot; &quot;The current use of the National Guard is wrong...These are men who did not sign up to go occupy foreign nations&quot;.

In August 2005, Ventura became the spokesperson for BetUS, an online sportsbook.

On December 29, 2011, Ventura announced his support for Ron Paul on &quot;The Alex Jones Show&quot; in the 2012 presidential election as &quot;the only anti-war candidate.&quot; Like Paul, Ventura is known for supporting a less interventionist foreign policy. But after Mitt Romney became the presumptive Republican nominee in May 2012, Ventura gave his support to Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson on June 12, 2012, who Ventura argued was the choice for voters who &quot;really want to rebel.&quot;

In September 2012, Ventura and his wife appeared in an advertisement calling for voters to reject a referendum to be held in Minnesota during the November elections that amend the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. The referendum was defeated.

In October 2022, Ventura endorsed incumbent governor Tim Walz for reelection in an advertisement, praising Walz&#x27;s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, protection of women&#x27;s rights, and protection of democracy.
In March 2024, after Ventura publicly endorsed his independent presidential bid, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shortlisted him as a candidate for vice president on his campaign ticket; many states require one to meet ballot access deadlines.

After Kennedy withdrew from the race and Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate, Ventura endorsed Harris. He strongly defended Walz against attacks by Republicans questioning his military service, pointing out that Walz served well after he reached retirement age. He accused Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance of hypocrisy for attacking Walz while standing behind Donald Trump, who avoided being drafted in the Vietnam War.

===Books===

Ventura wrote several other books after leaving office. On April 1, 2008, his &quot;Don&#x27;t Start the Revolution Without Me&quot; was released. In it, Ventura describes a hypothetical campaign in which he is an independent candidate for president of the United States in 2008. In an interview with the Associated Press at the time of the book&#x27;s release, Ventura denied any plans for a presidential bid, saying that the scenario was only imaginary and not indicative of a &quot;secret plan to run&quot;. On MinnPost.com, Ventura&#x27;s agent, Steve Schwartz, said of the book, &quot;[Ventura is revealing] why he left politics and discussing the disastrous war in Iraq, why he sees our two-party system as corrupt, and what Fidel Castro told him about who was really behind the assassination of President Kennedy.&quot;

Ventura also wrote &quot;DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODlicans: No More Gangs in Government&quot;, which was released on June 11, 2012. The book expresses Ventura&#x27;s opposition to the two-party system and calls for political parties to be abolished.

On September 6, 2016, &quot;Jesse Ventura&#x27;s Marijuana Manifesto&quot; was released, making the case for the legalization of cannabis and detailing the various special interests that benefit from keeping it illegal.

===&quot;Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura&quot;===

In December 2009, Ventura hosted TruTV&#x27;s new show &quot;Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura&quot;. &quot;Ventura will hunt down answers, plunging viewers into a world of secret meetings, midnight surveillance, shifty characters and dark forces,&quot; truTV said in a statement. On the program, Ventura traveled the country, investigating cases and getting input from believers and skeptics before passing judgment on a theory&#x27;s validity. According to TruTV, the first episode drew 1.6 million viewers, a record for a new series on the network.

The first season was followed by a second in 2010 and a third in 2012. After three seasons, the show was discontinued in 2013, but as of 2017 it is still shown worldwide on satellite TV.

===&quot;We The People&quot; podcast===
On July 31, 2014, Ventura launched a weekly podcast, &quot;We The People,&quot; distributed by Adam Carolla&#x27;s &quot;Carolla Digital&quot;, which ran until March 4, 2015. Guests included Larry King, Bill Goldberg, Chris Jericho, Roddy Piper, Donald Trump, Mark Dice, and leading members of the 9/11 Truth movement.

==Disputes==
===Navy SEAL background===
Bill Salisbury, an attorney in San Diego and a former Navy SEAL officer, has accused Ventura of &quot;pretending&quot; to be a SEAL. He wrote that Ventura blurred an important distinction by claiming to be a SEAL when he was actually a frogman with the UDT. Compared to SEAL teams, UDTs saw less combat and took fewer casualties.

Salisbury described Ventura&#x27;s Navy training thus:[Ventura] took a screening test at boot camp to qualify for...Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training...Those who completed BUD/S, when [Ventura] was in training, were sent to either a SEAL or an underwater demolition team. Graduation did not, however, authorize the trainee to call himself a SEAL or a UDT frogman. He had to first successfully complete a six-month probationary period in the Teams.Ventura underwent BUD/S training and was assigned to a UDT team. He received the NEC 5321/22 UDT designation after completing a six-month probationary period with Underwater Demolition Team 12. He was never granted the Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) 5326 Combatant Swimmer (SEAL) designation, which requires a six-month probationary period with SEAL TEAM ONE or TWO. In 1983, eight years after Ventura left the Navy, the UDTs were disbanded, and those operators were retrained and retasked as SEALs.

Responding to the controversy, Ventura&#x27;s office confirmed that he was a member of the UDT. His spokesman said that Ventura has never tried to convince people otherwise. Ventura said, &quot;Today we refer to all of us as SEALs. That&#x27;s all it is.&quot; He dismissed the accusations of lying about being a SEAL as &quot;much ado about nothing&quot;.

Former Navy SEAL Brandon Webb, the editor of the website SOFREP.com, wrote in a column on the site, &quot;Jesse Ventura graduated with Basic Underwater Demolition Class 58 and, like it or not, he earned his status.&quot; He disagreed with the argument that Ventura was a UDT and not a SEAL, saying &quot;try telling that to a WWII UDT veteran who swam ashore before the landing craft on D-Day.&quot; &quot;The UDTs and SEALs are essentially one and the same. It&#x27;s why the UDT is still part of the training acronym BUD/S&quot;, Webb wrote.

===Lawsuit against the TSA===
In January 2011, Ventura filed a lawsuit against the Transportation Security Administration, seeking a declaration that the agency&#x27;s new controversial pat-down policy violated citizens&#x27; Fourth Amendment rights and an injunction to bar the TSA from subjecting him to the pat-down procedures. Ventura received a titanium hip replacement in 2008 that sets off metal detectors at airport security checkpoints.

The U.S. district court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction in November 2011, ruling that &quot;challenges to TSA orders, policies and procedures&quot; must be brought only in the U.S. courts of appeals. After the court&#x27;s ruling, Ventura held a press conference in which he called the federal judges cowards; said he no longer felt patriotic and would henceforth refer to the U.S. as the &quot;Fascist States of America&quot;; said he would never take commercial flights again; said he would seek dual citizenship in Mexico; and said he would &quot;never stand for a national anthem again&quot; and would instead raise a fist.

===Chris Kyle dispute===
During a January 2012 interview on &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; to promote his autobiography &quot;American Sniper&quot;, former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle said he had punched Ventura in 2006 at a bar in Coronado, California, during a wake for Michael A. Monsoor, a fellow SEAL who had been killed in Iraq. According to Kyle, Ventura was vocally expressing opposition to the War in Iraq. Kyle, who wrote about the alleged incident in his book but did not mention Ventura by name, said he approached Ventura and asked him to tone down his voice because the families of SEAL personnel were present, but that Ventura responded that the SEALs &quot;deserved to lose a few guys.&quot; Kyle said he then punched Ventura. Ventura denied the event occurred.

==== Lawsuit ====
In January 2012, after Kyle declined to retract his statement, Ventura sued Kyle for defamation in federal court. In a motion filed by Kyle&#x27;s attorney in August 2012 to dismiss two of the suit&#x27;s three counts, declarations by five former SEALs and the mothers of two others supported Kyle&#x27;s account. But in a motion filed by Ventura, Bill DeWitt, a close friend of Ventura and former SEAL who was present with him at the bar, suggested that Ventura interacted with a few SEALs but was involved in no confrontation with Kyle and that Kyle&#x27;s claims were false. DeWitt&#x27;s wife also said she witnessed no fight between Kyle and Ventura.

In 2013, while the lawsuit was ongoing, Kyle was murdered in an unrelated incident, and Ventura substituted Taya Kyle, Chris Kyle&#x27;s widow and the executor of his estate, as the defendant. After a three-week trial in federal court in St. Paul in July 2014, the jury reached an 8–2 divided verdict in Ventura&#x27;s favor, and awarded him $1.85 million, $500,000 for defamation and $1,345,477.25 for unjust enrichment. Ventura testified at the trial. In August 2014, U.S. District Judge Richard H. Kyle (no relation to Chris Kyle) upheld the jury&#x27;s award, finding it &quot;reasonable and supported by a preponderance of the evidence.&quot; Attorneys for Kyle&#x27;s estate said that the defamation damages would be covered by HarperCollins&#x27;s libel insurance. The unjust enrichment award was not covered by insurance. After the verdict, HarperCollins announced that it would remove the sub-chapter &quot;Punching out Scruff Face&quot; from all future editions of Kyle&#x27;s book. Kyle&#x27;s estate moved for either judgment as a matter of law or a new trial. In November 2014, the district court denied the motions.

Kyle&#x27;s estate appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Oral argument was held in October 2015, and on June 13, 2016, the appeals court vacated and reversed the unjust-enrichment judgment, and vacated and remanded the defamation judgment for a new trial, holding that &quot;We cannot accept Ventura&#x27;s unjust-enrichment theory, because it enjoys no legal support under Minnesota law. Ventura&#x27;s unjust-enrichment claim fails as a matter of law.&quot; Ventura sought to appeal the circuit court&#x27;s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in January 2017, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.

In December 2014, Ventura sued publisher HarperCollins over the same statement in &quot;American Sniper&quot;. In December 2017, Ventura and HarperCollins settled the dispute on undisclosed terms, and Ventura dropped his lawsuit against both the publisher and Kyle&#x27;s estate.

==Personal life==

===Family===
On July 18, 1975, three days after his 24th birthday, Ventura married his wife, Terry. The couple have two children: a son, Tyrel, who is a film and television director and producer, and a daughter, Jade. With the exception of the first two WrestleManias, Ventura always said hello to &quot;Terry, Tyrel and Jade back in Minneapolis&quot; during his commentary at the annual event. Tyrel also had the honor of inducting his father into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004, and worked on &quot;Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura&quot;, including as an investigator in the show&#x27;s third season.

Ventura and his wife split their time between White Bear Lake, Minnesota, and Los Cabos, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Regarding his life in Mexico, Ventura has said: 

===Health===
During his wrestling days, Ventura used anabolic steroids. He admitted this after retiring from competition, and went on to make public service announcements and appear in printed ads and on posters warning young people about the potential dangers and potential health risks of abusing steroids.

In 2002, Ventura was hospitalized for a severe blood clot in his lungs, the same kind of injury that ended his wrestling career.

===Religion===
In 1999, Ventura said during an NBC News interview that he was baptized a Lutheran; later, he said on &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; that he was an atheist. In a &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, Ventura said, &quot;Organized religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and stick their noses in other people&#x27;s business. I live by the golden rule: Treat others as you&#x27;d want them to treat you. The religious right wants to tell people how to live.&quot; In his 1999 bestselling memoir &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got Time to Bleed&quot;, Ventura responded to the controversy sparked by these remarks by elaborating on his views on religion:

In April 2011, Ventura said on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; that he is an atheist and that his beliefs could disqualify him for office in the future: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe you can be an atheist and admit it and get elected in our country.&quot; In an October 2010 CNN interview, Ventura called religion the &quot;root of all evil&quot;, adding, &quot;you notice every war is fought over religion.&quot;

As governor, Ventura endorsed equal rights for religious minorities, as well as people who do not believe in God, by declaring July 4, 2002, &quot;Indivisible Day&quot;. He inadvertently proclaimed October 13–19, 2002, &quot;Christian Heritage Week&quot; in Minnesota.

<text>The World Football League (WFL) was an American football league that played one full season in 1974 and most of its second in 1975. Although the league&#x27;s proclaimed ambition was to bring American football onto a worldwide stage, only one team – the Hawaiians in Honolulu, Hawaii - was headquartered outside of continental North America. The league folded in 1975 midway through its second season. 

==History==
Gary Davidson, a California lawyer and businessman, was the driving force behind the World Football League. He had helped start the moderately successful American Basketball Association and World Hockey Association, some of whose teams survived long enough to enter the more established National Basketball Association and National Hockey League, respectively. Unlike his two previous efforts, the World Football League did not bring any surviving teams into the National Football League.

To get the league off the ground, Davidson knew that he needed investors. At a press conference held in Chicago on October 2, 1973, Davidson announced his core of investors, a group of men he called the &quot;founding fathers&quot;. These men were Robert Schmertz, who owned the WHA&#x27;s New England Whalers and NBA&#x27;s Boston Celtics; a former hockey prospect named Howard Baldwin (future owner of the NHL&#x27;s Pittsburgh Penguins), who ran the Boston Bulls charter; Ben Hatskin, who owned the WHA&#x27;s Winnipeg Jets; and R. Steve Arnold, another WHA associate.

Perhaps one of the biggest of the &quot;founding fathers&quot; was a Canadian movie producer, John F. Bassett. A former tennis prodigy and owner of the WHA&#x27;s Toronto Toros, Bassett came from a wealthy Canadian family. The family owned (among other entities) the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, two Toronto newspapers and interests in television stations. The younger Bassett had been mulling over starting his own professional football league when he happened to meet Davidson and he was given a franchise for Toronto. Bassett went on to own a team in another alternative football league, the USFL&#x27;s Tampa Bay Bandits in the mid-1980s.

Along with the original founding fathers, the rest of the owners soon fell into place, including a man whose own dreams of playing football were ended by a heart ailment, Thomas Origer, who later ran the Chicago Fire.

Several prospective owners were forced to drop out. Davidson was willing to sell his Philadelphia team to investor Harry Jay Katz, before learning that Katz didn&#x27;t have the strong resources that he claimed, and was in fact the target of several lawsuits, and rescinded his offer to sell the rights to Philadelphia. He nearly sold the Detroit franchise to Bud Huchul, but it was later discovered Huchul had been arrested 30 times and faced 27 lawsuits related to his previous business dealings.

Davidson had initially planned for his league to commence play in 1975. However, the league came under pressure to accelerate its timetable, largely on account of strained labor relations affecting both established professional leagues. In the spring of 1974, players were threatening to go on strike in both the NFL and CFL, which could have delayed the start of their seasons and/or caused the quality of their product to deteriorate if owners attempted to bring in replacement players.
The possibility of being the only major professional football league in operation (or, at least, the possibility that the quality of WFL football might be compared favorably with that of established league rosters filled with &quot;scab&quot; players) appeared to be too good an opportunity to pass up – combined with rumors of another upstart league, it persuaded Davidson to advance the new league&#x27;s planned debut to 1974.

One team went through several identities. The team slated to play in Maryland was to be called the Washington Capitals, but the expansion NHL team had already trademarked the rights to the nickname. A contest held to name the team came up with the name Ambassadors. The team then became the Baltimore-Washington Ambassadors, and then the Baltimore name was dropped, and the team simply became known as the Washington Ambassadors. In order to boost ticket sales, Washington owner Joe Wheeler offered former Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas a contract as head coach and general manager of the team, but Unitas declined as he was already under contract with the San Diego Chargers; he retired at the end of the 1973 season. Wheeler then made the same offer to Redskins linebacker Jack Pardee, who quickly signed with the new league.

In the meantime, Wheeler had engaged in a war for territory with Pardee&#x27;s old boss, Redskins owner Edward Bennett Williams. Wheeler wanted the Ambassadors to play at RFK Stadium, but Williams refused to allow it, and the Ambassadors were on the move. Without ever stepping on the field, the team went through their third relocation, starting off as the Baltimore-Washington Ambassadors, then becoming the Washington Ambassadors, and finally the Virginia Ambassadors.

===Competing for NFL players===

The fledgling WFL did succeed in raising stagnant salaries in the NFL. Average salaries in professional football were among the lowest in the four major North American sports, and the National Football League Players Association and the Canadian Football League Players Association had both gone on strike prior to their leagues&#x27; respective 1974 seasons in an effort to lift many of the rules suppressing free agency and player salaries. In addition, the NFL did not have a free agency system in place then (and one was not established until 1993).

With the uncertain labor situation, the WFL had the opportunity to provide players with a better deal than the established leagues would give them, along with the promise of employment. Davidson&#x27;s league garnered major publicity when the Toronto Northmen, led by John F. Bassett, signed three Miami Dolphins players, fullback Larry Csonka, halfback Jim Kiick, and wide receiver Paul Warfield to what was then the richest three-player deal in sports, an astounding US$3.5 million to start in 1975. The pact was a guaranteed, personal-services contract, so the trio would be paid even if the WFL did not survive its first season.
The NFL took notice, as did their players when they were approached to jump leagues. The Oakland Raiders nearly lost both their quarterbacks. Ken Stabler signed with the Birmingham Americans, and Daryle Lamonica penned a contract to play for the Southern California Sun starting in 1975. John Wilbur left the Over-the-Hill Gang as a Washington Redskin to invest, coach special teams, and play for the Hawaiians. The Dallas Cowboys also took roster hits when WFL teams in Hawaii and Houston signed running back Calvin Hill and quarterback Craig Morton respectively. The Hawaiians also signed Minnesota Vikings Pro Bowl WR John Gilliam and San Francisco 49ers All-Pro TE Ted Kwalick; however, Gilliam ended up with the Chicago Winds and Kwalick signed with the Philadelphia Bell prior to the 1975 season.

By early June 1974, the WFL claimed they had some 60 NFL players under contract. Many of these defections came in the form of futures contracts. The players would play out their existing deals with the NFL, then jump to the WFL when those deals expired. Thus, Stabler planned to stay with the Raiders through 1975, then would have joined Birmingham in 1976 had the team and league survived that long.

===1974 season===

Playing a 20-game regular season schedule in 1974 – six games longer than the NFL&#x27;s then 14-game slate – the WFL staged no exhibition games (although their teams did participate in preseason scrimmages).

The season was scheduled to begin on Wednesday, July 10 and end on Wednesday, November 13. This was a 20-game season in 19 weeks – a schedule accomplished by having double games (primarily Monday and Friday) on Labor Day weekend.

Some complained that the schedule was poorly drafted: although most teams played on Wednesday nights with a national TV game slated for Thursday nights, the Hawaiians played their home games on Sunday afternoons, meaning when the Hawaiians had a home game, they played an opponent who flew to Honolulu after having played just four days earlier. In addition, back-to-back meetings between two teams were common.

The WFL held a college draft. The first six rounds were held on January 22, 1974, with the remaining 30 rounds held on February 5. David Jaynes, quarterback from Kansas, was the first player selected in the draft by the original Memphis franchise that became the Houston Texans by the time the season started.
As was common with many upstart leagues, the WFL&#x27;s intended lineup of teams changed several times before they even played a down. Most notably, Bassett&#x27;s Toronto Northmen were forced to find a new home after the Canadian government threatened to ban any American football team from competing with the CFL. Though the Canadian Football Act never passed, the mere threat of it prompted Bassett to move the team to Memphis, where it became the Memphis Southmen. It was generally referred to by fans, local media, and even some official team materials as the Grizzlies, which they officially renamed themselves to the following season (not to be confused with the current NBA team of the same name). The WFL suffered an even more serious blow when the CFL and NFL reached agreements with their striking players that ensured that the upstart league would be forced to compete with both of their established rivals.

The original schedule called for a four-team playoff, with semifinal games held on Wednesday–Thursday November 20–November 21, and the World Bowl on Friday, November 29 (the night after Thanksgiving) at the Gator Bowl Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. League officials also boldly discussed plans for expansion teams in Europe and Asia.

In the first few weeks, the WFL looked to be a resounding success. Attendance outpaced the first week of the American Football League in 1960, averaging just under 43,000 a game. The box office numbers proved to be the beginning of the WFL&#x27;s undoing when two teams admitted to inflating their gates on a scale virtually unprecedented in major league sports. The Jacksonville Sharks admitted that out of the 105,892 fans who attended their first two games, 30,000 had gotten in for free. The Philadelphia Bell&#x27;s first two home games totaled 120,253 fans. However, when they paid city taxes on those gates, they admitted that 100,198 of the tickets had been given away for free or sold at significantly reduced prices. Presumably, the giveaways were intended in part to pique the public&#x27;s curiosity and interest, but they ended up seriously eroding the credibility of both the teams and the league.

Six games into the first season, a number of WFL franchises were in serious trouble. The Detroit Wheels were looking to move to Charlotte, and the Florida Blazers made overtures of bringing the first place club to Atlanta. In September, two franchises relocated in mid-season. The Houston Texans moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, as the Shreveport Steamer, and they were followed a week later by the New York Stars, who relocated to Charlotte and became the Charlotte Hornets (also not to be confused with the present-day NBA franchise of the same name; they played one road game after the official move still under the &quot;Stars&quot; name). On top of this, the Wheels moved one game to London, Ontario due to poor ticket sales, this time without any complaints from Canadian officials.

It was discovered that in the rush to commence play in 1974, several WFL teams had paid less than the original $120,000 franchise fee in order to meet Davidson&#x27;s target of 12 teams. Additionally, league officials had conducted little to no due diligence. As a result, most of the league&#x27;s teams were badly undercapitalized. By most accounts, the only reasonably well-financed teams were Memphis, Philadelphia, the Hawaiians and Southern California.

In many cases, WFL teams were unable to meet the most basic team expenses. For instance, the Portland Storm&#x27;s players were reportedly being fed by sympathetic local fans. The Hornets had their uniforms impounded for not paying a laundry bill from the time the team was located in New York and were not paid regularly after the third week in October. The Birmingham Americans were not paid for the last two months of the season, the Florida Blazers went three months without pay (and reportedly survived on McDonald&#x27;s meal vouchers), and the Sharks were not paid for what turned out to be their last six games. The other teams&#x27; finances were not much better, as the Southmen, Bell and Hawaiians were the only teams who met payroll for every week of the season.

The most dire situation, however, was that of the Detroit Wheels. The team&#x27;s original 33 owners appeared to pay for team expenses out of pocket as they arose, resulting in what amounted to a club football team playing at the professional level. On several occasions, the team was left without uniforms when they did not pay the cleaning bill, forcing them to cancel practices. After several hotels and airlines went unpaid, the Wheels were also unable to fly to games or get a place for the players to stay without paying in advance. One player was forced to pay a hospital bill for his son out of pocket after being informed the team&#x27;s insurance policy had been cancelled for non-payment of premiums. The owners refused to provide filming equipment for the coaches.

The Wheels seemingly bottomed out when they arrived in Philadelphia to face the Bell. The players discovered that there were no medical supplies or tape available, and initially refused to take the field. When it looked like the Wheels would have to forfeit, a salesman at the game donated enough tape to allow them to play. The league was forced to take over the team after complaints from the players.

Perhaps one of the most bizarre incidents for the WFL in 1974 involved defensive end John Matuszak, who had jumped from the NFL&#x27;s Houston Oilers to play for the WFL&#x27;s Houston Texans. While Matuszak worked out on the field prior to a game against the New York Stars, attorneys for the Oilers and federal marshals arrived at the stadium: five minutes into the first quarter, shortly after sacking Stars quarterback Tom Sherman for a 13-yard loss, Matuszak was benched—the Texans had been served with a restraining order that barred Matuszak from playing another down for the Texans until his Oilers contract expired at the end of the 1977 NFL season. Afterwards, Matuszak waved the document to show the stunned home crowd why he was sitting on the bench, while the Oilers, who were angered at this debacle, subsequently traded Matuszak to the Kansas City Chiefs.

The league seemingly bottomed out in October when it shut down the Wheels and the Sharks after 14 games. The collapse of the Sharks meant that the Gator Bowl did not host World Bowl I; coincidentally, Jacksonville was also slated to be the host of the 1986 USFL Championship Game, but the USFL folded before that season began. It was not until February 2005 that the city hosted its first championship pro football game, Super Bowl XXXIX.

Davidson was forced to resign in October 1974, and Hawaiians owner Christopher Hemmeter was named the new commissioner a month later.

Late in the year, the league announced that it would award its Most Valuable Player a prize of $10,000 at the World Bowl. Rather than endure the embarrassment of media sneers about whether a WFL check would clear, the league neatly stacked $10,000 in cash high upon a table in the middle of the field. The MVP award was a three-way split, and the players involved split the cash.

The playoff format itself was also chaotic: numerous playoff formats were tossed around, including brackets ranging from three to eight teams, with one owner proposing the World Bowl be canceled and the championship handed to the regular-season champion Memphis Southmen.
Eventually, six teams were chosen for the postseason. The two teams with the best regular-season records, Memphis and Birmingham, were awarded first-round byes. The other two division winners would play in first-round games against the runners-up in their division. Originally, Florida was to host Charlotte, while Southern California was to host the Hawaiians.

However, after being informed only 1,000 advance tickets had been sold for the Hornets&#x27; matchup against the Blazers, league officials forced the Hornets to withdraw from the playoffs. The Hornets&#x27; cut of the gate would have only been enough for their players to get $100 for the game, nowhere near enough for the financially strapped team to justify the trip to Orlando. League officials arranged for the Bell to advance in their place, as they were slightly more robustly funded and could cover their travel costs.

Despite the various disasters, many thought the WFL performed fairly well, though below NFL standards. Many games were tight, decided by seven points or less, and the Action Point, the one-point conversion run or pass attempt after a touchdown, was favored among WFL coaches and critics. The league championship—the World Bowl, or &quot;World Bowl I&quot;—was staged in Birmingham between the hometown Birmingham Americans and the Florida Blazers.

Not even the World Bowl could go off without a hitch. For a time, it appeared that the game would not take place because the Americans owed $237,000 in back federal taxes. However, the Internal Revenue Service agreed to let the game go ahead in return for a portion of the gate. Both teams were owed several weeks&#x27; back pay; the Americans only agreed to play when their owner promised them championship rings if they won.

Aside from the money woes the league was having, the players did not hold back in complaining about the officiating during the game. Blazers running back Tommy Reamon scored what he thought was a touchdown, but the officials on the field ruled that he fumbled the ball out of the end zone before he hit the ground, resulting in a touchback that gave the ball to Birmingham. Replays clearly showed that the ball had broken the plane of the end zone before slipping out of Reamon&#x27;s hands. While the phantom turnover did not account for any Birmingham points, it did serve to break the spirits of the Blazers. Birmingham led 15–0, with Birmingham quarterback Matthew Reed scoring an action point. Birmingham led 22–0, and thought they had the game wrapped up. However, Florida managed a small comeback, trailing 22–21 as the gun went off in the fourth quarter. After the game, the Americans&#x27; jerseys were seized to satisfy team debts. (&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; referred to the game, prophetically, as &quot;The first, and possibly &quot;only&quot; World Bowl&quot;.)

As if losing a championship game in a squeaker was not bad enough, things got much worse. Florida head coach Jack Pardee bolted back to the NFL to take over the Chicago Bears, and the Blazers&#x27; franchise was sold off at a court-ordered auction after it was discovered that Blazers part-owner Rommie Loudd had financed the team through selling cocaine and a tax evasion scheme, for which he was arrested shortly after the season (and later convicted).

The champions did not fare much better; only days after the World Bowl, the Americans&#x27; office furniture was repossessed by sheriff&#x27;s deputies.

The financial losses were tremendous: The Hawaiians had lost $3.2 million, while the New York Stars/Charlotte Hornets had over $2 million of debt against just $94,000 in assets, and the Jacksonville Sharks and Detroit Wheels were liquidated owing nearly $4 million: Detroit had 122 creditors looking to recoup losses.

Many NFL stars who had been attracted to the league quickly sought to get out of their contracts. Quarterback Ken Stabler (Raiders), defensive end L. C. Greenwood (Steelers), and quarterback Craig Morton (Giants) all were able to get courts to nullify their contracts with WFL teams, while former NFL veterans like George Sauer Jr., Charley Harraway, Leroy Kelly, and Don Maynard all retired.

Home-grown talent, like quarterbacks Tony Adams, Danny White, and wideout Alfred Jenkins quickly bolted for the NFL, with Adams landing with the Kansas City Chiefs, White with the Dallas Cowboys, and Jenkins with the Atlanta Falcons; Florida head coach Jack Pardee also got star Blazers&#x27; tight end Greg Latta to jump ship with him to the NFL&#x27;s Bears.

===1975 season===

Though many predicted the WFL was dead, the league returned for the 1975 season. During the offseason, Hemmeter developed a plan to restore a measure of financial sanity to the league by paying players and coaches based on a percentage of revenues, while imposing strict capitalization requirements on the teams. Several markets from 1974 returned under new team names and new ownership. The deceased Sharks of Jacksonville came back as the &#x27;Express.&#x27; The Portland Storm became the Portland Thunder, the Birmingham Americans were replaced by the Vulcans, and the Chicago Fire became the Winds. The World Bowl runner-up Florida Blazers folded, and their franchise rights were relocated to San Antonio, Texas, as the San Antonio Wings. Akron, Ohio was briefly mentioned as a location for the twelfth WFL team (the replacement for the Wheels), but this never materialized, and only 11 teams played in the 1975 season. Only two teams, Memphis and Philadelphia, returned with the same ownership from the prior season. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, in its postmortem, noted that the change between 1974 and 1975 was so drastic that for all intents and purposes, the WFL of 1975 was a nearly completely different entity than its predecessor. The WFL of 1974 was described as a bombastic credit risk, while the WFL of 1975 was a safer but much quieter entity that failed because it was ignored.

An idea produced by the league was to have players wear different colors of pants based on their position. Offensive linemen were to wear purple pants, running backs green pants, receivers blue pants, linebackers red, and defensive backs yellow. Quarterbacks and kickers were to wear white pants. In addition to the colors, the pants were also adorned with items such as pinstripes (for the offensive linemen) or large stars (for quarterbacks) for those not watching on color television. After a test run in preseason games, this idea was scrapped.
The league changed the scheduling format from 20 games without exhibitions to 18 games (played in 20 weeks due to the odd number of teams) with exhibitions. Gone were weeknight games; the new schedule had games on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. But there were still problems, as although the original plan called for a July 5 preseason opener and August 2 regular season openers, the regular season had to open a week earlier, with a single game on Saturday, July 26, due to a stadium conflict. This meant that a single regular season game was played in the midst of the last weekend of preseason play (with some preseason games being played the next night).

Several more NFL free agents, including Calvin Hill and Ted Kwalick, signed on with the struggling WFL. Memphis had secured three top-line, but fading Dolphins stars in Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick, and Paul Warfield. The Southern California Sun secured the services of former AFL and NFL quarterback Daryle Lamonica.

The Chicago Winds made an offer to aging Super Bowl III MVP Joe Namath, who seriously considered the offer, before refusing and re-signing with the New York Jets. The Winds invested considerable money and time in the effort to sign Namath (the team even designed its uniform to emulate the Jets&#x27;), and all but promised he was coming to Chicago. The embarrassing rejection by Namath crippled the Winds, who were shut down five weeks into the season. It also resulted in the loss of the WFL&#x27;s national television deal (see below), rendering the league all but invisible.

Despite Hemmeter&#x27;s efforts, several teams soon ran into financial difficulties, in part due to alarmingly low attendance figures. (The WFL averaged 21,423 fans per game in 1974, but only 13,931 per contest in &#x27;75.) The Winds were shut down five games into the season after dropping below league capitalization requirements, leaving the league with ten teams (which itself was a convenience, because it eliminated the mandatory bye week). It was not enough to stem the tide; by late October rumors abounded that four of the remaining teams were on the verge of folding.

On Wednesday, October 22, a few days before the start of week 13, the WFL ceased operations. Hemmeter said that the league would have needed to spend as much as $40 million over two years to be successful, a bill that the league&#x27;s directors, seven of whom sat on the boards of banks, did not feel could be justified. The Birmingham Vulcans, by virtue of their league-best record of 9–3 at the time of the shutdown, were proclaimed league champions.

With the relative financial stability of the Birmingham and Memphis clubs, both attempted to join the NFL but were refused. In 1979, the Memphis club owners filed an anti-trust suit against the NFL. Their case was ultimately dismissed on May 30, 1984, by which time the owners had already established the Tampa Bay Bandits in the next professional league, the United States Football League (then in the midst of its second season; that league incidentally filed their own, more famous antitrust suit against the NFL in 1986). Although the NFL expanded by two teams in 1976, that expansion had been planned before the WFL&#x27;s first season, and neither city (Tampa and Seattle) had hosted a WFL franchise.

One of the issues facing the WFL going into 1975 was how to hold a draft. The owners of the WFL teams collectively agreed they did not have the money to seek out the top college prospects. Instead, the league came up with a different plan. Instead of drafting a certain player, a WFL team would draft an entire NFL or CFL team. This gave that team the rights to negotiate with players under contract for that team. For example, only the Charlotte Hornets had the right to offer contracts to players from the Buffalo Bills, Baltimore Colts, and Detroit Lions, and only the Chicago Winds could offer contracts to players from the Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Jets, and Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League.

===Legacy===
The league&#x27;s struggles led to endless sarcastic comments (starting with the league&#x27;s own abbreviation, which was often pronounced &quot;Wiffle&quot;). Chicago Fire offensive lineman Steve Wright quipped that he had been offered a million dollar contract: &quot;A dollar a year for a million years!&quot;

In the 1976 season, Memphis Southmen coach John McVay joined the staff of the New York Giants and brought with him nine players from the Southmen. In what has been described as &quot;the closest approximation to a meeting between the champions of the WFL and the NFL&quot; (even though the Southmen never won a WFL title), the Southmen-reinforced Giants upset the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers, 17–0, in a preseason match that year.

The WFL, for all its embarrassing miscues, produced a number of coaches who found success in the NFL, notably Jack Pardee, Lindy Infante, and Marty Schottenheimer. Jim Fassel, a quarterback for the Hawaiians, became a head coach in the NFL and UFL, taking the New York Giants to Super Bowl XXXV in 2001 and the Las Vegas Locomotives to a win in the 2009 UFL Championship Game. McVay worked his way up the Giants organization and eventually became the team&#x27;s head coach; he had even more success as general manager of the San Francisco 49ers during the 1980s dynasty years. Several players, most notably Pat Haden, Danny White, Alfred Jenkins, Greg Latta, and Vince Papale, later found success in the NFL as well.

Four WFL alumni made it to the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Larry Csonka, Paul Warfield, Leroy Kelly and Don Maynard; all four were already established stars in the NFL before joining the WFL.

The league&#x27;s most severe impact was on the Miami Dolphins, who had just won consecutive Super Bowls before the WFL&#x27;s snagging of three of their star players. This changed the course of NFL history, by opening the door to dominance by two other AFC teams, the Steelers and the Raiders, during the second half of the 1970s.

While by no means the pioneer of &quot;singular&quot; team nicknames, which had been used by some college and professional sports teams since the 19th century, the high quantity of them in a single league (&quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;Sun&quot;, &quot;Bell&quot;, &quot;Storm&quot;, &quot;Steamer&quot;, &quot;Thunder&quot;, &quot;Express&quot;) was rare in professional sports at the time, and was a distinguishing mark of the league.

The WFL also arguably affected locations of other professional football teams: from the NFL, Hawaii hosted the Pro Bowl from 1980 through 2009 and again from 2011 to 2016, Jacksonville got the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1995, Charlotte received the Carolina Panthers in the same year, and Houston&#x27;s expansion franchise, the Texans, revived the name of the WFL team in 2002. Though the WFL&#x27;s Toronto establishment failed due to Canadian resistance, the Buffalo Bills (with Canadian backing and special conditions) played one home game in Toronto a season from 2008 to 2013, and the league&#x27;s original intent to expand the game globally is being partially fulfilled by the NFL International Series. Other cities became regular stops for franchises in other leagues:

*Memphis hosted the Showboats of the USFL from 1983 to 1985, the Mad Dogs of the CFL in 1995, the XFL&#x27;s Maniax in 2001, the Express in the AAF in 2019, and another Memphis Showboats in the 2022 USFL and 2024 UFL. The NFL also used Memphis as a temporary home for the Tennessee Oilers in 1997 before their stadium in Nashville was completed.
*Birmingham hosted the Vulcans and Magic of the AFA, Stallions of the USFL, the Fire of the WLAF from 1991 to 1992, Barracudas of the CFL in 1995, the Thunderbolts of the XFL in 2001, the Iron in the AAF in 2019. In 2022, the Birmingham Stallions of the second reiteration of the USFL became the champions of the new league version, a championship it successfully defended the following two seasons.
*Orlando hosted the Americans of the AFA, Renegades of the USFL, Thunder of the WLAF, Rage of the XFL, the Tuskers of the UFL and the Apollos of the AAF.
*Shreveport later hosted the Steamers of the AFA and the Pirates of the CFL.
*Jacksonville hosted the Firebirds of the AFA and the Bulls of the USFL before the NFL Jaguars franchise was awarded. In 2010, Jacksonville received an Arena Football League expansion franchise, which revived the Sharks name.
*Charlotte later hosted the Chargers of the AFA before the NFL Panthers franchise was awarded.
*San Antonio later hosted the Charros of the AFA, Gunslingers of the USFL, the Riders of the WLAF, the Texans of the CFL, the Matadors of the SFL, the Commanders of the AAF, the San Antonio Brahmas of the 2020 XFL and 2024 UFL, and four home games for the NFL New Orleans Saints during their 2005 &quot;road season&quot;, in which the Saints had to abandon their usual stadium, the Louisiana Superdome, due to damage from Hurricane Katrina. (San Antonio has also hosted NFL exhibition games.)
*Southern California hosted the Express of the USFL, the Xtreme of the 2001 XFL, the Wildcats in the 2020 XFL, the Dragons of the SFL and was expected to host a franchise in the UFL, a promise that was never fulfilled before the league&#x27;s sudden shutdown in 2012.
*The New York/New Jersey metropolitan area hosted the New Jersey Generals of the USFL, the New York Sentinels of the UFL, and the Guardians of the 2020 XFL, and two teams that bore both states&#x27; names: the Knights of the WLAF and the Hitmen of the 2001 XFL.
*Chicago hosted the Fire of the AFA, Blitz of the USFL and the Enforcers of the 2001 XFL.
*Detroit later hosted the Michigan Panthers in both the 1983-85 and 2022-present incarnations of the USFL and UFL and was targeted as a possibility for XFL expansion before the 2001 XFL folded.
*Portland later hosted the Breakers of the USFL and served as the launching point for the CFL USA initiative with an exhibition game in June 1992, though it never received a CFL team.
*Houston later hosted the Marshals in the SFL and the Roughnecks in the 2020 XFL, along with another Roughnecks in the 2024 UFL.

The NFL&#x27;s Houston Texans revived the name of the WFL&#x27;s franchise for that city when it began play in 2002. (&quot;Texans&quot; had been used by an NFL Dallas team in 1952—after it folded, the remnants were taken over by the expansion Baltimore Colts—and by an AFL Dallas team in the early 1960s, which became the Kansas City Chiefs.) The moniker was also used by an arena football team in Dallas in the early 1990s, and by a CFL San Antonio team for one year in the 1990s.

There is also a Major League Soccer team called the Chicago Fire, and there are/were also NBA teams called the Memphis Grizzlies (2001–present) and Charlotte Hornets (1988–2002, 2014–present) (the nickname &quot;Hornets&quot; was used for minor league baseball teams in Charlotte long before the WFL entry; also, the &quot;Grizzlies&quot; name for the Memphis NBA team was in use when the franchise was still in Vancouver). The Jacksonville Sharks and Portland Thunder names were later revived for teams in the 2010 revival of the Arena Football League, with the indoor Sharks (outlasting its namesake by several years) having since moved to the National Arena League.

The American Football Association was conceived as a successor to the WFL, and in some newspapers was even referred to as the &quot;New WFL&quot;. Many of the AFA teams revived, with slight alterations, the names of WFL teams that had resided in its respective cities, and several of the AFA&#x27;s key personnel had previously served in similar capacities with WFL teams; the league operated from 1977 to 1983.

The league also caused significant problems for the lower levels of professional football. Its arrival resulted in the end of the ACFL and SFL, effectively killing minor-league professional football in the United States until the AFA&#x27;s formation in 1979.

==NFL jumpers==
Several NFL players signed contracts, or in some cases, future contracts with teams in the World Football League. In the case of a future contract, this was when a player entering the final years of a contract with an NFL team would sign a contract with a WFL team that goes into effect the moment the player&#x27;s obligation with his NFL club is finished. Each signing is broken down by team, said players previous NFL club, and year player signed a contract. Just because a player signed does not mean he ever played for that team. L. C. Greenwood, for instance, never played a down of football for Birmingham. No one shown with a date after 1975 ever actually played for the WFL team listed due to the league&#x27;s insolvency as of that year.

Many other players jumped as well. Dallas running back Duane Thomas signed with the Hawaiians in 1975 after being released by the Washington Redskins. Longtime Cleveland Browns running back Leroy Kelly signed with Chicago. Other players joined the WFL despite being drafted by NFL squads, such as quarterback Danny White, who signed with Memphis before eventually joining the NFL&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys.

==Television and radio coverage==
The league&#x27;s only national television contract was with the TVS Television Network, a syndicator of American sports programming. Merle Harmon and Alex Hawkins announced TVS&#x27; Thursday Night Game. Guest announcers were often brought into the booth including Paul Hornung, George Plimpton, Alex Karras, and McLean Stevenson.

According to TVS president Eddie Einhorn, the games actually got decent ratings at first. However, affiliates started bailing out after the Philadelphia and Jacksonville gate-inflation scandals. The trickle became a flood after two teams moved in the middle of the season and two more folded altogether. New York&#x27;s midseason relocation came in part because the lights at Downing Stadium were nowhere near bright enough to illuminate the entire field, leading TVS to deem them inadequate for broadcast. This limited the Stars&#x27; national television exposure to away games. By the time of the World Bowl, the games were struggling to achieve Nielsen ratings above 2.0, and TVS found it nearly impossible to sell advertising. Despite the losses, Einhorn was actually willing to stick it out until Hemmeter announced the Winds were going to try to sign Namath. Einhorn told Hemmeter that the league had effectively bet its whole credibility on Namath coming to Chicago, and none of TVS&#x27; affiliates would commit to broadcasting the 1975 season unless Namath signed with the Winds. When he didn&#x27;t, the WFL was left without a national television contract. The loss of such a critical revenue stream was a factor in the league&#x27;s collapse midway through the season.

Recordings from a few WFL telecasts survive, including two games involving the Jacksonville Sharks: one includes approximately one hour of footage from the July 10, 1974 match between the Sharks and the New York Stars, and the second includes ten minutes of footage from the Sharks hosting the Chicago Fire on July 17. NFL Films included clips from the Sharks-Stars game, including an animated introduction, in their television documentary series &quot;Lost Treasures of NFL Films&quot; in 2001. In it, host Steve Sabol describes the damaged video tape as &quot;a fourth generation copy of a copy&quot; and as &quot;TV history&quot;; Sabol also noted that much of the WFL footage was lost or destroyed, and that much of what remained was home-recorded kinescopes far below broadcast quality. Lewis Bice, who shot promotional film for Birmingham to be used for highlight reels, preserved some of his work, which NFL Films used in the special along with the surviving telecast footage; NFL Films was pleasantly surprised at the caliber of Bice&#x27;s surviving footage, which was remarkably close to NFL Films&#x27;s own work, with Sabol commenting that if he&#x27;d known of Bice back then, &quot;we would&#x27;ve hired him in a second.&quot; Twenty-one minutes of the TVS broadcast of the 1974 World Bowl - including the pre-game show, player introductions, and opening kick off - was uploaded to YouTube in 2018.

One complete game on radio in audio form also survives - the 1974 WFL Playoff Game involving the California Sun and the Hawaiians, recorded from Hawaiians flagship station KGMB. A mostly complete recording of the Chicago Fire&#x27;s radio broadcast on WJJD-FM of their game against the Philadelphia Bell also survives as do fragments of other WFL radio broadcasts.

Local affiliates provided most of the television and radio coverage throughout the WFL existence. Notable local announcers include John Sterling (New York Stars/Charlotte Hornets television), Spencer Ross (New York Stars radio), Bob Sheppard (New York Stars PA), Mike Patrick (Jacksonville Sharks), Larry King (Shreveport Steamer), Larry Matson (Birmingham Americans/Birmingham Vulcans), Fred Sington (Birmingham Americans/Birmingham Vulcans) and Eddie Doucette and Vince Lloyd (Chicago Fire radio and TV respectively).

While the Boston Bulls franchise never made it onto the field; the team&#x27;s preparations for the 1974 season had gone along far enough for the team to have signed contracts that January, shortly before the plug was pulled, with WLVI to televise the club&#x27;s away games (as well as agreeing to pick-up the TVS package) and WEEI-AM to carry the team&#x27;s entire schedule on radio. Although the franchise would be folded into the New York Stars, WLVI nevertheless honored their agreement to be the TVS/WFL outlet for Boston.

The league predated the vast expansion of cable television and sports networks spearheaded by the birth of ESPN in 1979, which severely limited the options the WFL had to televise. At the time, the AFL–NFL merger, coupled with the launch of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, had spread the NFL broadcast rights over all three of the Big Three television networks. The NFL, in a 1973 memo, noted that if the NFL had left one of the Big Three networks without NFL rights, it would have left an opening for the WFL. This memo was later used as evidence when the United States Football League (which included Einhorn as one of its team owners) filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, hoping to break its television contracts; the lawsuit, although it acknowledged the monopoly, did not succeed in voiding the contracts.

==Rules==
The WFL had several important rules differences from the National Football League of that era, and many were eventually adopted by the older league:

* The WFL football was orange colored, to make it more visible at night and to fit with 1970s aesthetics.
* Touchdowns were worth 7 points, instead of 6. As a result of this, the standard point after touchdown kick was eliminated.
* In lieu of the PAT kick, conversions called &quot;Action Points&quot; were instituted, and could only be scored via a scrimmage play (much in the same way as a two-point conversion) and were worth one point. The ball was placed on the two-and-a-half-yard line for an Action Point. This rule was a revival of a 1968 preseason experiment by the NFL and American Football League (called &quot;Pressure Points&quot;), but the WFL claimed this as an invention of their own, crediting Bill Finneran, a computer analyst from White Plains, New York, with the innovation. The original XFL employed a similar rule for its only season in 2001.
* Kickoffs were from the 30-yard line instead of the 40. Until 1973, NFL teams kicked off from the 40; from 1974 to 1993 and since 2011, the NFL moved its kickoffs to the 35; and from 1994 to 2010, the kickoff line was pushed back to the 30.
* Receivers needed only one foot in bounds for a legal pass reception, instead of both feet in the NFL then and now. College and high school football, the Arena Football League, and the CFL have always used the one-foot rule.
* Bump-and-run pass coverage was outlawed once a receiver was 3 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. The NFL adopted this rule in 1978, with a 5-yard bump zone.
* The goalposts were placed at the end line (the back of the end zone). At that time, college football goalposts were at the end line, but the NFL had its goalposts at the goal line from 1933 through 1973. In the 1974 season, the NFL also moved its posts back to the end line (where they have remained since) to curb the then-growing dominance of placekickers.
* Missed field goals were returned to the line of scrimmage or the 20-yard line, whichever was farther from the goal line. The NFL also adopted this rule for its 1974 season, then replaced the line of scrimmage with the point of the kick in 1994. Before this rule, missed field goals were (if unreturned) touchbacks, with the ball placed at the 20-yard line; this rule remains in high school football. U.S. college football later adopted this rule, but left the point as the line of scrimmage rather than the point of the placement.
* A player in motion was allowed to move toward the line of scrimmage before the snap, as long as he was behind the line of scrimmage at the snap. This rule had never been used at any level of outdoor American football, but was (and still is) part of Canadian football. This rule is used in the Arena Football League and was used in the XFL.
* Punt returners were prohibited from using the fair catch, although the covering team could not come within 5 yards of the kick returner until he caught the ball. This rule also came from Canadian football (which calls the breach of this 5-yard area a &quot;no yards&quot; penalty), which still uses it, as does Arena football with kickoffs and missed field goals. The XFL also used this rule, calling it the &quot;halo rule&quot;.
* Penalties for offensive holding and ineligible receiver downfield were 10 yards, instead of 15. Several years later, these became 10-yard penalties at all levels of football; the NFL made this rule change in 1977. Still later, the ineligible receiver penalty was changed to 5 yards (with loss of down).
* The WFL&#x27;s original overtime system was unique among American football leagues. Overtime in the regular season was one fixed 15-minute period, divided into two halves of 7½ minutes, each starting with a kickoff by one of the teams. The complete overtime was always played; there was no &quot;sudden death&quot; feature. In 1975, the WFL changed its overtime to the 15-minute sudden-death period.
* Limited (or no) pre-season games. In 1974 and 1975, NFL teams played six pre-season games and 14 regular-season games (which was changed in 1978 to four pre-season and 16 regular-season games, and again in 2021 to the current three pre-season and 17 regular-season games.). The CFL played 16-game seasons with four pre-season games (since 1986, they play an 18-game season with two pre-season games). In contrast, the WFL&#x27;s 1974 schedule called for 20 regular-season games and no pre-season games; in 1975, it was 18 regular-season games and two pre-season games.
* Summertime football. The NFL&#x27;s regular season started on September 15 in 1974 and on September 21 in 1975; the WFL&#x27;s regular season started on July 10 in 1974 and on July 26 in 1975 (with the 1975 pre-season starting on July 5). At the time, the Canadian Football League, which must contend with colder winters than American leagues, had recently completed a gradual move from playing twice weekly with a similar start time to the season as the NFL to playing once weekly and starting its season in July (the CFL now commonly starts its regular season in June).
* Weeknight football (1974). While NFL games were played mostly on Sundays and, from 1970 onwards, a game on Monday night, the WFL&#x27;s 1974 schedule called for Wednesday night football (with a Thursday night national TV game). This scheduling format was abandoned in 1975. The featured Thursday night game was later adopted as &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; by the NFL in 2006.
* The Dicker-rod (named for its inventor, George Dicker). For measuring first-down yardage, instead of using a 10-yard chain strung between two sticks and a chain crew to perform the task, the WFL used a device operated by a single person. This was a single stick, approximately three yards long, used to gauge the position of the football relative to the nearest gridiron line (the lines completely crossing the playing area, spaced every five yards).

<text>The United States Football League (USFL) was a professional American football league that played for three seasons, 1983 through 1985. The league played a spring/summer schedule in each of its active seasons. The 1986 season was scheduled to be played in the autumn/winter, directly competing against the long-established National Football League (NFL). However, the USFL ceased operations before that season was scheduled to begin.

The ideas behind the USFL were conceived in 1965 by New Orleans businessman David Dixon, who saw a market for a professional football league that would play in the summer, when the National Football League and college football were in their off-season. Dixon had been a key player in the construction of the Louisiana Superdome and the expansion of the NFL into New Orleans in 1967. He developed &quot;The Dixon Plan&quot;—a blueprint for the USFL based upon securing NFL-caliber stadiums in top TV markets, securing a national TV broadcast contract, and controlling spending—and found investors willing to buy in.

Though the original franchise owners and founders of the USFL had promised to abide by the general guidelines set out by Dixon&#x27;s plan, problems arose before the teams took the field, with some franchises facing financial problems and instability from the beginning. Due to pressure from the NFL, some franchises had difficulty securing leases in stadiums that were also used by NFL teams, forcing them to scramble to find alternative venues in their chosen city or hurriedly move to a new market. The USFL had no hard salary cap, and because of this, some teams quickly escalated player payrolls to unsustainable levels despite pledges to keep costs under control. While a handful of USFL franchises abided by the Dixon Plan and were relatively stable, others suffered repeated financial crises, and there were many franchise relocations, mergers, and ownership changes during the league&#x27;s short existence; however, none of its teams actually folded during any given season. These problems were worsened as some owners began engaging in bidding wars for star players against NFL teams and each other, forcing other owners to do the same or face a competitive disadvantage.

On the field, the USFL was regarded as a relatively good product. Many coaches and team executives had NFL experience, and many future top NFL players and coaches got their start in the new league, including several who were later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and/or the College Football Hall of Fame. The Michigan Panthers won the first USFL championship in 1983. The Philadelphia Stars won the second USFL championship in 1984, and after relocating to Baltimore, won the final USFL championship in 1985 as the Baltimore Stars in what was effectively a rematch of the first USFL title game.

In August 1984, the USFL voted to move from a spring to a fall schedule in 1986 to compete directly with the NFL. This was done at the urging of New Jersey Generals majority owner Donald Trump and a handful of other owners as a way to force a merger between the leagues. As part of this strategy, the USFL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the National Football League in 1986, and a jury ruled that the NFL had violated anti-monopoly laws. However, in a victory in name only, the USFL was awarded a judgment of just $1, which under antitrust laws, was tripled to $3. This court decision effectively ended the USFL&#x27;s existence. The league never played its planned 1986 season, and by the time it folded, it had lost over $163 million (equivalent to $ in dollars).

==Talent level==
Three consecutive Heisman Trophy winners signed with USFL teams directly out of college: Georgia running back Herschel Walker and Boston College quarterback Doug Flutie signed with the New Jersey Generals, and Nebraska running back Mike Rozier signed with the Pittsburgh Maulers.

Future Pro Football Hall of Fame members defensive end Reggie White of the University of Tennessee, offensive tackle Gary Zimmerman of the University of Oregon, quarterbacks Jim Kelly of the University of Miami and Steve Young of Brigham Young University, and linebacker Sam Mills of Montclair State began their professional careers with the USFL&#x27;s Memphis Showboats, Los Angeles Express, Houston Gamblers, Los Angeles Express, and Philadelphia Stars, respectively. A number of NFL veterans of all talent levels played in the USFL. Certain NFL backups such as quarterbacks Chuck Fusina and Cliff Stoudt, G Buddy Aydelette, and WR Jim Smith had limited success in the NFL but became major stars in the USFL. But many NFL backups struggled or never made it in the USFL. Additionally, the USFL also lured in NFL starters, including a handful in the prime of their careers including 1980 NFL MVP, Cleveland Browns&#x27; quarterback Brian Sipe, Buffalo Bills&#x27; three-time Pro Bowl running back Joe Cribbs and Kansas City Chiefs&#x27; three-time Pro Bowl safety Gary Barbaro.

==History==

===Background===
For many decades after its inception, American football was widely regarded as a second-tier sport behind baseball which was long-regarded as America&#x27;s national pastime. As a result, even the elite levels of American football generally lacked both the financial wherewithal to build their own facilities and the political clout to secure significant public funds to construct such venues, and as such were compelled to play primarily in ballparks hastily re-purposed for football. However, since gridiron football in particular is responsible for excessive wear and tear on a natural grass playing field, baseball clubs were not keen to see football played in their parks throughout the entire baseball season. Thus, the need to use ballparks played a large part in ensuring that the National Football League and early rivals would delay the start of their seasons until September when the baseball season was winding down, thus affording baseball teams the exclusive use of their facilities in the spring and summer.

Starting in the 1950s, a number of technological changes and trends eventually caused some to question the traditional timing of the American football season. In particular, football became a much more lucrative sport, the invention of artificial turf and developments in the growth and maintenance of natural grass made it more practical for baseball and football to be played at elite levels in the same facility at the same time of the year, and the increasing influence of television combined with the prevalence of a farm system in which Major League Baseball controlled the rights to baseball levels in all levels of play caused many minor league baseball clubs (some of whom played in large facilities that could be easily re-purposed for major league football) to be much less lucrative in their own right. Finally, the growing popularity of college football (which also played a fall season to coincide with the fall semester) led to the construction and expansion of dozens of large stadiums for collegiate teams, which were mostly football-specific or at least designed primarily for football, and were primarily in cities without professional football franchises.

It was in this environment, in 1965, that David Dixon, a New Orleans antiques dealer, who would be instrumental in bringing the New Orleans Saints (and building their current home stadium, the Superdome) to his hometown, began to envision football as a possible spring and summer sport.

This was not the first time the United States Football League name was used; there had been a previous, short lived attempt in 1945 to start up a league with that name.

===Organization===
Over the next 15 years, Dixon studied the last two challengers to the NFL&#x27;s dominance of pro football—the successful American Football League and the troubled World Football League. In 1980, he commissioned a study by Frank Magid Associates that found promising results for a spring and summer football league. He had also formed a blueprint for the prospective league&#x27;s operations, which included early television exposure, heavy promotion in home markets, and owners with the resources and patience to absorb years of losses—which he felt would be inevitable until the league found its feet. He also assembled a list of prospective franchises located in markets attractive to a potential television partner.

Dixon was well aware that many attempts to challenge the NFL had foundered due to financial troubles. The WFL, for instance, was plagued by teams that were so badly underfinanced that they could not meet the most basic expenses. With this in mind, Dixon wanted to ensure that USFL teams had the wherewithal to put a credible product on the field. To that end, the league required potential owners to submit to a detailed due diligence and meet strict capitalization requirements. They were also required to post a $1.5 million letter of credit for emergencies.

With respected college and NFL coach John Ralston as the first employee, Dixon signed up 12 cities—nine where there already were NFL teams and three where there were not. The Dixon Plan called for teams in top TV markets to entice the networks into offering the league a TV deal. All but two of the 12 initial teams were located in the top 13 media markets in the US at the time.

After almost two years of preparation, Dixon formally announced the USFL&#x27;s formation at the 21 Club in New York City on May 11, 1982, to begin play in 1983. ESPN president Chet Simmons was named the league&#x27;s first commissioner in June 1982.

According to the Dixon Plan, if the league was going to be a success, it needed television revenue and exposure. In 1983, the league signed contracts with both over-the-air broadcaster ABC and a cable TV broadcaster, the four-year old ESPN, to televise games. The deals yielded roughly $13 million in 1983 and $16 million in 1984, including $9 million per year from ABC. ABC had options for the 1985 season at $14 million and 1986 at $18 million. Each week, there would be a nationally televised game, as well as the USFL&#x27;s own version of Monday Night football.

===Stumbles before play begins===
Like almost all startup pro football leagues, the USFL had some off-the-field factors that prevented the league from starting out with their preferred membership. The problems started when the original owner of the Los Angeles franchise, Alex Spanos, pulled out and instead became a minority owner (and eventually majority owner) of the NFL&#x27;s San Diego (now Los Angeles) Chargers. Jim Joseph, a real estate developer who had lost out to friend Tad Taube for the USFL&#x27;s San Francisco Bay Area franchise, had thought he would be content to be a part-owner of the Oakland Invaders. When the potentially more lucrative Los Angeles franchise became available, Joseph snapped up the rights to the area. The owners of the USFL&#x27;s San Diego franchise, cable television moguls Bill Daniels and Alan Harmon, were denied a lease for Jack Murphy Stadium. While this was in part due to pressure from the Chargers, the main opposition came from Major League Baseball&#x27;s Padres who held the lease to the stadium at the time and did not want to see football played at the facility throughout the baseball season. Los Angeles was seen as critical to the league&#x27;s success, and Dixon and Simmons felt that two cable moguls would be better suited to head the league&#x27;s efforts there. Joseph was forced to move his operation. The team opened play in Phoenix, Arizona, where it became the Arizona Wranglers. Daniels and Harmon&#x27;s team became the Los Angeles Express.

The League&#x27;s Boston franchise, the Breakers, also had stadium problems. The Boston ownership group wanted to play in Harvard Stadium, but were unable to close a deal with the university; Sullivan Stadium was owned by the New England Patriots, who were unwilling to share their venue with a rival, while Fenway Park was being used in the spring by the Boston Red Sox and was also unavailable, and Alumni Stadium on the campus of Boston College, for reasons never made public, also declined. Finally they were able to negotiate a lease to play at Nickerson Field on the campus of Boston University, a facility that seated only 21,000 people.

There were plans to establish four franchises in Canada prior to the inaugural season, located in Vancouver, Edmonton, Montreal and the Toronto/Hamilton metroplex (with the last of these to play at Ivor Wynne Stadium). The proposal was pushed by John F. Bassett, the Canadian who would go on to own the Tampa Bay Bandits USFL team. However, Senator Keith Davey warned that the Canadian government would act to protect the Canadian Football League (the league in which in all four of the aforementioned Canadian cities had teams in) from competition. The Canadian Football Act had been proposed, but not approved, when Bassett had tried to establish the Toronto Northmen in the World Football League in 1974. Such legislation would have banned US football leagues from playing in Canada. In particular, Montreal&#x27;s CFL team, the Concordes, was on precarious financial ground, having just been established to replace the recently folded Alouettes. This led Bassett to drop the idea.

Once play actually started, the league experienced the same kind of franchise instability, relocation, and closures that almost all pro football leagues, including the NFL, experienced in their early years.

===The 1983 season===

* The Washington Federals finished tied with the Arizona Wranglers as the league&#x27;s worst team with 4–14 records. The Federals were coached by the Canadian Football League&#x27;s fourth most successful coach at the time, Ray Jauch. The team was injury prone and mistake prone, on and off the field. Prior to the 1983 season, the team traded away the rights to the league&#x27;s leading sacker, linebacker John Corker to Michigan for a 5th round pick. In spite of a rotating door at QB, the Federals lost 8 games by a TD or less, a fact that gave team owner Berl Bernhard hope for the 1984 season. The 1983 team finished second to last in attendance drawing 13,850 per game.
* New Jersey Generals&#x27; running back Herschel Walker emerged as the league&#x27;s first superstar running for 1,812 yards and 17 TDs. However, the team won only 6 games.
* The Denver Gold won only 7 of 18 games in their first year, but finished first in the league in attendance drawing an average of 41,736 fans to see a team that featured a number of former Broncos. Team owner Ron Blanding stuck to his budget, and took great pride in seeing his team defeat the big budget Chicago Blitz in Chicago 16–13 in week three on a TD run with 22 seconds to go. Blanding fired very popular former Broncos Coach Red Miller after a 4–7 start, but was still able to finish the season with strong attendance. Due to low attendance numbers and over budget spending on players on all the other teams in the league, Blanding&#x27;s Gold was the only USFL team to turn a profit in 1983.
* The Oakland Invaders finished 9–9 and won the Pacific Division behind the play of 29-year-old quarterback Fred Besana and former Oakland Raiders tight end Raymond Chester and halfback Arthur Whittington. Besana had played for the Twin City Cougars of the California Football League from 1980 to 1982, but played like a proven veteran, finishing the season as the league&#x27;s second rated passer.
* In spite of a strong team led by 36-year-old former WFL quarterback Johnnie Walton and CFL veteran halfback Richard Crump, the Boston Breakers were unable to draw the regular sellouts they needed to survive at Nickerson. (Even when they sold out Nickerson, they still lost money due to its small capacity.) Boston finished the season 11–7, narrowly missing the playoffs. Walton, who had retired from pro football years earlier, and had spent the previous 3 years coaching college football, was the league&#x27;s 7th ranked passer. Boston and Washington were the only USFL teams to draw less than 14,000 per game in 1983. The other 10 teams drew over 18,000 per game.
* The George Allen-led Chicago Blitz had been described as an &quot;NFL caliber&quot; team and were heavily favored to win the title and dominate the rest of the league. The team was stacked with quality players, led by NFL veteran quarterback Greg Landry, rookie HB Tim Spencer of Ohio State, and rookie wide receiver Trumaine Johnson of Grambling. In week two, Jim Joseph&#x27;s Arizona Wranglers led by rookie quarterback Alan Risher of LSU came from a fourth-quarter 29–12 deficit to defeat the Blitz 30–29 in a game considered by many to be the biggest upset in USFL history. The Blitz would go on to lose five more games in the regular season and be edged out by Michigan for the Central Division title. In the first round of the playoffs, the Blitz would carry a 38–17 lead into the fourth quarter vs. the host Philadelphia Stars before losing to the Stars 44–38 in OT.
* The Philadelphia Stars finished a league best 15–3. Led by Coach Jim Mora, NFL veteran quarterback Chuck Fusina, rookie halfback Kelvin Bryant of North Carolina and a very good defense led by linebacker Sam Mills, the Stars made it to the title game where they almost came back from a 17–3 third-quarter deficit before falling 24–22 to the Michigan Panthers.
* Michigan Panthers owner A. Alfred Taubman quickly decided he was willing to pay to fill the holes on his team with NFL caliber talent. Early in the season, the Panthers signed NFL veterans like guard Thom Dornbrook, offensive tackle Ray Pinney, fullback Cleo Miller and defensive end John Banaszak. Consequently, after a 1–4 start, the team jelled and finished the regular season 11–2, edging out Chicago for the Central Division title. They dispatched Oakland in the playoffs 37–21 and weathered a frantic comeback by the Stars to become the first league champions.

On the whole, the inaugural season was a success for the league. Attendance was in line with league expectations at about 25,000 fans per game, and television ratings slightly exceeded projections (an average Nielsen rating of 6.1, when the league had aimed for 5.0). The brand of play was exciting and entertaining, and the 1983 championship was generally recognized as being a more entertaining game than most of the Super Bowls of the era. Even in cities where the fans were not numerous, the fan base was passionate; the documentary &quot;Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL?&quot; made note of a regular-season game in which Boston Breakers fans stormed the field following a come-from-behind victory over the Stars at Nickerson Field.

===The 1983–1984 off-season===
* In September 1983, the New Jersey Generals were sold by J. Walter Duncan to real-estate magnate Donald Trump. The year before, Trump had been tapped to be the original owner of the franchise, but had backed out in order to make an unsuccessful bid to buy the NFL&#x27;s Baltimore Colts; the league subsequently awarded the franchise to Duncan instead.
* The Boston Breakers were unable to find a more suitable venue within Boston and its surrounding areas, so the Breakers relocated to New Orleans on October 18, 1983, and later sold to New Orleans businessman Joseph Canizaro.
* Seeing the out-of-control spending worsening, Blanding sold his Denver Gold to Doug Spedding for $10 million. Blanding is widely thought to be the only owner to make a profit on the USFL.
* Needing fresh capital, the league chose to expand league membership from 12 to 18 teams, adding the Pittsburgh Maulers, Houston Gamblers, San Antonio Gunslingers, Memphis Showboats, Oklahoma Outlaws and Jacksonville Bulls. The Dixon plan called for expansion to 16 in the league&#x27;s second year. The Outlaws were originally slated to play in San Diego, but as was the case with what became the Express, could not get a lease for Jack Murphy Stadium. The Outlaws opened play in Tulsa at Skelly Stadium. The Gamblers were technically not an expansion team. Founder David Dixon had reserved a franchise for himself in founding the league. He had chosen not to field a team in 1983 to help guide the league. By 1984, Dixon was disgusted with the path the league was on and the league owners were sick of Dixon&#x27;s constant complaints about them overspending. With their blessing, he sold his franchise for slightly less than the $6 million expansion fee. Dixon&#x27;s franchise became the Houston Gamblers.
* After seeing the Wranglers lose ten games in a row to finish 4–14 (tied with Washington for the league&#x27;s worst record) and perhaps more importantly seeing attendance wilt in the summer heat at Sun Devil Stadium, Joseph decided to sell the Wranglers. Meanwhile, in spite of having the league&#x27;s highest profile coach, George Allen, and being at worst the third best team in the league, the Chicago Blitz had drawn an anemic 18,133 per game, unable to contend with Major League Baseball&#x27;s Cubs and White Sox, the latter on their way to the postseason for the first time in 24 years. Blitz owner Dr. Ted Diethrich, a Phoenix resident, felt the losses did not justify an investment so far from his home in Phoenix. Diethrich sold the Blitz to Milwaukee heart surgeon James Hoffman, and then bought the Wranglers from Joseph. Almost immediately after Diethrich closed on his purchase of the Wranglers, he and Hoffman swapped their team assets—coaching staff, most of the players, and all. To Blitz fans, it seemed that Hoffman had jettisoned one of the league&#x27;s elite teams in favor of a team that tied for the league&#x27;s worst record. In truth it was worse than that. In a league starved for competent QB play, Wrangler triggerman Alan Risher stayed in Arizona. The new Blitz would feature longtime Bear backup QB Vince Evans (signed in November 1983 to a four-year, $5 million deal). In January, The Blitz tendered an offer that would have been the largest contract in football—$2 million a year for three years—to Bears running back Walter Payton. Payton advised he would consider the offer, but would not be rushed by the Blitz. The Blitz&#x27;s 1984 season was scheduled to start on February 27, 1984, and they had little success selling season tickets. The Blitz needed Payton to sign quickly to help season ticket sales, so they had put a deadline on the offer of February 9, 1984. Before he made up his mind, the Blitz withdrew the offer realizing they simply did not have the finances. With a less talented team and no big names to excite the fans, Chicago&#x27;s season ticket sales predictably flatlined, in spite of Hoffman sinking a lot of money into advertising. Just prior to the start of the season, a frustrated Hoffman walked away from the Blitz, leaving the team to the minority owners.
* In addition to Trump buying the Generals, the Los Angeles Express were sold to J. William Oldenburg. The league believed that the teams based in the nation&#x27;s two largest markets were owned by the owners with the deepest pockets. Trump and Oldenburg both went on signing sprees. Trump poached several NFL starters, including Cleveland&#x27;s QB Brian Sipe. Oldenburg&#x27;s Express went after a number of highly regarded collegiate players. This combined with a general lack of quality QBs (only nine QBs in the 12-team league finished the 1983 season with QB ratings above 70) and HBs (even in an 18-game season only six rushers broke the 1000 yard mark) tipped off another explosion in league spending as USFL teams raided the NFL and college ranks to keep up.

===The 1984 season===

* The USFL went to a seven-man officiating crew in 1984 adding the side judge.
* After a game 1 blowout 53–14 road loss to the expansion Jacksonville Bulls, Washington Federals head coach Ray Jauch was fired. In week 2, star RB Craig James was injured. The team collapsed. Despite solid play from 2nd year QB Mike Hohensee, WR Joey Walters, and HB Curtis Bledsoe, the team would finish 3–15, losing twice to the 3–15 expansion Pittsburgh Maulers and going 0–7 vs. the expansion teams. With seven games to go in the season, a press conference was held to announce the Federals had been sold to Sherwood &quot;Woody&quot; Weiser who intended to move the team to Miami. The team would be coached by Miami Hurricanes&#x27; coach Howard Schnellenberger.
* After two games, William Tatham Jr., son of Oklahoma Outlaws owner William Tatham, announced Skelly Stadium was insufficient to support a pro team and that the Outlaws would be moving the following year. In spite of this lame duck status, awful spring weather, and a season-ending ten-game losing streak, the team drew an average of 21,038 fans per game.
* A few games into the season, with the Chicago Blitz struggling and the fans staying away in droves, the team was near financial collapse. The league was forced to take over the Blitz for the remainder of the 1984 season in order to protect the league&#x27;s TV deals which called for teams in the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago markets. With 4 games to go, a press conference was held announcing that Eddie Einhorn would become the new owner of the USFL&#x27;s Chicago franchise. At the press conference, it was stated that although the new team would not be the Blitz, Einhorn&#x27;s franchise would retain the rights to all Blitz players and coaching staff—strongly implying the team would play in the 1985 season.
* The expansion Houston Gamblers rookie QB Jim Kelly of the University of Miami emerged as the league&#x27;s second superstar carrying his team to win the central conference with a 13–5 record. Kelly threw 44 TDs and piled up over 5,000 yards. The Gamblers would fall to the eventual league runner up Arizona Wranglers in the playoffs, 17–16.
* The Los Angeles Express&#x27; signings of high-profile collegiate players culminated with the signing of BYU QB Steve Young to a $40 million guaranteed contract—at the time, far and away the largest contract in pro football history. The young talent was slow to adapt to the pro game and the Express continued to hover around .500. With one of the leagues&#x27; highest payrolls and poor attendance, financial losses mounted. It is estimated that the Express lost as much as $15 million in 1984. The Express did manage to make the playoffs and defeated the defending league champion Panthers 27–21 in triple overtime, before falling to the eventual league runners-up, Allen&#x27;s Arizona Wranglers, 35–23.
* In spite of seeing his Wranglers team make it to the title game, Ted Diethrich had seen enough. He had lost millions for the second year in a row. Despite fielding a dramatically improved team, he had only had seen a negligible increase in attendance in Arizona over the previous year&#x27;s numbers.
* The Philadelphia Stars again finished with the league&#x27;s best record and made it to the title game, this time defeating Diethrich&#x27;s Wranglers, 23–3.

===The 1984–1985 off-season===
* The owner of the Los Angeles Express, J. William Oldenburg, stopped paying the team&#x27;s bills late in the season after media and federal investigations revealed he had lied about his net worth. News of his financial troubles sent a collective shiver through the league in the middle of the 1984 season. With Chicago already gone, the potential loss of the Express might have put the league&#x27;s contract with ABC in jeopardy.
* Seeking a larger market, a larger stadium, and to share expenses, the Outlaws sought to merge with the Oakland Invaders, but Oakland Invaders owner Tad Taube walked away from the deal rather than give control of the team to Outlaws part-owner and general manager William Tatham Jr.
* Weiser pulled the plug on his deal to buy the Federals and move them to Miami. Bandits minority owner Donald Dizney, a health care industry magnate unrelated to the differently-spelled Disney family, stepped in 5 days later and bought the Federals. Under his ownership, the team was moved to Orlando, where they became the Orlando Renegades.
* After the league officially announced plans to move to the fall in 1986 (see below), a number of teams moved elsewhere after their owners decided they could not directly compete with the NFL. The Breakers moved a second time, this time to Portland, Oregon. The defending champion Philadelphia Stars moved to Baltimore, capitalizing on the departure of the NFL&#x27;s Colts to Indiana—until the Stars realized that the Baltimore Orioles still occupied Baltimore&#x27;s only usable stadium during the spring and summer, forcing the team to settle in College Park, just outside Washington city limits, while retaining the &quot;Baltimore Stars&quot; name until the season moved to the fall in 1986.
* The Michigan Panthers merged with the Oakland Invaders, while the Pittsburgh Maulers folded after losing a reported $10 million in their only season.
* Einhorn, who along with Trump was one of the principal advocates of fall play, decided to sit out the 1985 season. ABC cleared this move due to the league&#x27;s anemic ratings in Chicago, allowing the league to shut down the Blitz, who had lost nearly $6 million in 1984.
* The assets of Diethrich&#x27;s Arizona Wranglers (see Chicago Blitz of 1983) would be acquired by the Tathams in a deal often referred to as a &quot;merger&quot;, as the rosters were merged. The resulting Arizona Outlaws featured players from both teams but was run by the Tathams.

===The 1985 season===

* Gamblers minority owner Jay Roulier agreed to buy the Express, but was pushed out in short order during training camp after it emerged that he had misled league officials about his net worth. The league took control of the team and decided to run it on a shoestring until a new owner could be found. The league financed and ran the Express all season, but could not find an owner. With a huge salary burden and dreadful attendance, the Express barely survived the season.
* Owners agree to a 4-year CBA with the United States Football League Players Association.
* San Antonio Gunslingers owner Clinton Manges stopped paying the team&#x27;s bills with about a month to go in the season.
* The Denver Gold&#x27;s attendance flatlined due to the planned move to the fall, as fans were not willing to choose between the Gold and the NFL&#x27;s Broncos. The Gold would have hosted a playoff game against the Memphis Showboats, but ABC forced the league to move the game to Memphis rather than endure the embarrassment of playing in a near-empty Mile High Stadium.
* Stallions owner Marvin Warner was forced to give up control of the team after Home State Savings Bank, the Cincinnati savings and loan he controlled, was brought down in a massive run, one of the first casualties of the savings and loan crisis. Unfortunately, the Stallions&#x27; emergency letter of credit was drawn on Home State, rendering it worthless. Team president Jerry Sklar urged the Stallions&#x27; limited partners to chip in more money, and persuaded the city government to buy a $100,000 stake in the team along with a $900,000 credit line. This allowed the Stallions to finish out the season.

===The 1985–1986 off-season===
* The San Antonio Gunslingers had their franchise revoked when Manges ignored a league-imposed deadline to make restitution for the team&#x27;s debts.
* The Breakers were disbanded after owner Joe Canizaro suffered two-year losses in the realm of $17 million.
* Los Angeles and Oakland announced that they would suspend operations.
* Denver merged with Jacksonville, to play the 1986 season in Jacksonville, while Houston merged with New Jersey, to play in New Jersey.
* Although Eddie Einhorn remained involved with the league&#x27;s antitrust lawsuit, he opted not to field a Chicago team in the USFL&#x27;s fall 1986 season as planned, and the team was left off the proposed 1986 schedule.
* Tampa Bay initially pulled out of the league, prepared to continue playing in the spring even if it meant forming a new league; owner John Bassett was, in either case, too ill to continue and would die on May 14, 1986. Lee Scarfone agreed to take over the Bandits&#x27; USFL franchise in July 1985 and have the team play a fall schedule.

===1986===
Arizona, Baltimore, Birmingham, Jacksonville, Memphis, New Jersey, Orlando and a newly reorganized Tampa Bay team were scheduled to play an ultimately aborted 18-game fall schedule season in 1986. At the time, only New Jersey and Tampa Bay shared markets with an NFL team (in New Jersey&#x27;s case, they shared with two NFL teams).

===2022===

It was announced that the USFL would be returning in March 2022 with at least eight teams and a broadcasting deal with Fox Sports. Despite claims that this was a reactivation of the old league, no figures from the original league were involved in the new league, which was instead backed by the principals of the extant developmental showcase The Spring League, Brian Woods and Fox Sports. On June 3, 2021, the new USFL confirmed a return in the spring of 2022. In December 2023, it was announced that the new USFL had merged with the XFL to form the United Football League.

==Competition vs. NFL==

===The Dixon plan vs. building a league of stars===
At first the USFL competed with the older, more established National Football League by following the Dixon plan. The plan allowed the league to compete not just by playing its games on a March–June schedule during the NFL off-season, but also by having the following conditions:
* Teams play in large, NFL-caliber stadiums.
* Teams plan for large year 1 pre-season promotional budgets to introduce the team to the local market.
* A tight players&#x27; salary cap of $1.8 million per team (the NFL introduced a salary cap in 1994).
* A territorial draft, to better stock teams with familiar local collegiate stars to help the gate (similar to the proposed All-American Football League and used by the now-defunct Alliance of American Football).

The Dixon plan laid out a budget to allow all teams to manage losses in the initial lean years. As mentioned earlier, prospective owners had to meet strict capitalization requirements and post a $1.3 million line of credit for emergencies.

The league&#x27;s TV revenue met the requirements of the Dixon plan. The Plan called for first year attendance over 18,000 per game. In 1983, 10 of the 12 teams exceeded that threshold. Player spending was where the league deviated from the plan, in the name of pursuing stars.

The league&#x27;s biggest splash—the signing of Herschel Walker, a three time All-American and the 1982 Heisman Trophy winner—represented a significant breach from the Dixon Plan. Like the NFL, the USFL barred underclassmen from signing. However, league officials were certain that this rule would never stand up in court, so they allowed Walker to sign with the New Jersey Generals. More importantly, Walker signed a three-year contract valued at $4.2 million with a $1 million signing bonus. Due to the USFL&#x27;s salary cap rules, this was a personal-services contract with Generals owner J. Walter Duncan, and not a standard player contract. Nonetheless, the other owners did not raise any objections, knowing that having the reigning Heisman winner in the fold would lend the league instant credibility.

Other marquee stars to sign with the league were Craig James, Anthony Carter and Kelvin Bryant as well as some familiar NFL vets like Chuck Fusina and members of the NFL vet laden Chicago Blitz, like Greg Landry, showed that the upstart league was a credible challenger to the NFL. The league also made a serious run at some other stars, such as Eric Dickerson and Dan Marino.

The pursuit of top-level talent proved to be a double-edged sword. While the presence of many blue-chip stars proved the league could put a competitive product on the field, many teams wildly exceeded the league&#x27;s player salary cap in order to put more competitive teams on the field. For instance, the Michigan Panthers reportedly lost $6 million—three times what Dixon suggested a team could afford to lose in the first season—even as they became the league&#x27;s first champions. The desire to compete with other loaded USFL teams and for the league to be seen as approaching NFL caliber led to almost all of the teams exceeding the Dixon Plan&#x27;s team salary cap amount within the league&#x27;s first 6–18 months.

Dixon urged the members of the league to reduce spending. Rather than backing off spending, recommitting to a firmer salary cap, and dispersing some of the larger contracts to expansion teams to alleviate the problem, the league sought other options to take on revenue to cover increased costs overruns. These actions magnified the problem.

The league added six more teams in 1984 rather than the four initially envisioned by Dixon, to pocket two more expansion fees. This put more pressure on the TV deal, which was not designed to support an 18 team league. A frustrated Dixon sold his stake and got out.

Additionally, the league was so determined to appear to put a credible product on the field that on some occasions, it set aside its own vetting procedures–all of which backfired disastrously. When Diethrich sold the Blitz to Hoffman in order to clear the way for his purchase of the Wranglers before the 1984 season, they did not take a close look at Hoffman&#x27;s financial statements. Realizing he was in over his head, Hoffman was forced to scramble to find minority partners. When there were no takers, he walked away from the team after the second preseason game, forcing the league to take over the team.

In San Antonio, the league was so enamored at Manges&#x27; apparent oil wealth that it not only did not closely vet his application, but did not require him to make an initial capital investment. Instead, Manges paid team expenses out of pocket as they arose, resulting in an operation that appeared short of professional standards. The Gunslingers&#x27; offices were in a double-wide trailer, and they used folding chairs to bring Alamo Stadium up to minimum capacity. Manges&#x27; practices caught up with him in 1985, when the oil market collapsed. The result was a litany of bounced checks, culminating in the team going the last four games without pay. It later emerged that Manges had been in financial difficulty as early as 1980.

The worst situation of all, however, was in Los Angeles. Original owners Alan Harmon and Bill Daniels sold the Express to mortgage banker J. William Oldenburg before the 1984 season. Swayed by Oldenburg&#x27;s apparent net worth of $100 million, the USFL took his word as evidence that he would be a solid owner for one of its marquee franchises. However, in June 1984, investigations by the FBI, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; revealed that the man who made waves by signing a roster of high-priced young talent did not have even a fraction of the money to buy the team. He abruptly walked away from the team during the playoffs. Gamblers minority owner Jay Roulier took over the team in October, only to be pushed out just months later when it emerged that he too had lied about his net worth. The league was forced to run the team on a shoestring that season.

With the new wave of teams, more college stars like Marcus Dupree, Mike Rozier, Reggie White, Jim Kelly, Steve Young and other young stars of the day signed high dollar contracts to play for USFL teams in 1984, as did high-profile NFL stars like Doug Williams, Brian Sipe, Joe Cribbs, and Gary Barbaro.

===Spring schedule vs. fall schedule===
In 1984, the league began discussing the possibility of competing head-to-head with the NFL by playing its games in the fall beginning in 1986. The strongest proponents of playing in the fall were Chicago owner Eddie Einhorn and Generals owner Donald Trump. Einhorn and Trump argued that if the USFL moved to the fall, it would eventually force a merger with the NFL in which the older league would have to admit at least some USFL teams. They also argued that if a merger did occur, the surviving teams&#x27; original investment would more than double.

A consulting firm recommended sticking with a spring season. Despite the protests of many of the league&#x27;s &quot;old guard&quot;, who wanted to stay with the original plan of playing football in the spring months, on August 22, 1984 the owners voted to move to the fall starting in 1986. On April 29, 1985, the league&#x27;s owners voted 13–2 to reaffirm their decision to begin playing a fall season in 1986. Tampa Bay Bandits owner John F. Bassett, who had registered one of the two &quot;nay&quot; votes, declared his intention to pull his team out of the USFL and organize a new spring football league. However, failing health (he died from cancer in May 1986) forced Bassett to abandon his plans and sell the Bandits to minor partner Lee Scarfone, who agreed to keep the franchise in the USFL. The spring advocates had lost, and the fall advocates now set their sights on forcing a merger with the NFL, or at the very least winning a sizable settlement and securing a TV network for fall broadcasts.

As a direct result of this decision, the Pittsburgh Maulers folded rather than compete with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the sale of the struggling Washington Federals to Weiser&#x27;s Miami-based ownership group collapsed, the New Orleans Breakers and 1984 champion Philadelphia Stars had to relocate, and the 1983 champion Michigan Panthers surprised the commissioner with an announcement that they would not be playing in the Detroit area for the 1985 season. Panthers owner A. Alfred Taubman informed the league at the meeting that he had negotiated a conditional merger with Tad Taube&#x27;s Oakland Invaders depending on the outcome of the vote, with Taubman as majority owner. With an expectation of fall play in 1986, Einhorn decided not to field a team for the final spring 1985 season. Within a few weeks of the decision, the USFL had been forced to abandon four lucrative markets, abort a move to a fifth and suspend operations in a sixth. In hindsight, this destroyed the USFL&#x27;s viability, although the Maulers folding likely would&#x27;ve happened anyway due to the team being owned by shopping mall magnate Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. (who also owned the National Hockey League&#x27;s Pittsburgh Penguins at the time), whose son Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. owned the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers (a team now owned by his sister Denise DeBartolo York), causing a potential conflict of interest for the family between the USFL and the NFL.

ABC offered the USFL a 4-year, $175 million TV deal to play in the spring in 1986. ESPN offered $70 million over 3 years. Following all the mergers and shutdowns, there just were not enough spring football advocates left in the league to accept those contracts. The owners in the league walked away from what averaged out to $67 million per year starting in 1986 to pursue victory over the NFL.

After the 1985 season, more plans were announced to accommodate the fall schedule, pool financial resources and avoid costly head-to-head competition with NFL teams. Two mergers were announced. The Denver Gold merged with the Jacksonville Bulls, with the Bulls as the surviving team. Trump bought the assets of the Houston Gamblers for an undisclosed amount and merged them with the New Jersey Generals. While the Generals were the surviving team, Gamblers coach Jack Pardee was named as the merged team&#x27;s new coach. Both the Gold and Gamblers had seen their attendance plummet to unsustainable levels, as their fanbases were not willing to abandon the Denver Broncos and Houston Oilers, respectively. In spite of all of these changes, the USFL would never play a fall game.

===&quot;USFL v. NFL&quot; lawsuit===
In another effort to keep themselves afloat while at the same time attacking the more established National Football League, the USFL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the older league, claiming it had established a monopoly with respect to television broadcasting rights, and in some cases, on access to stadium venues.

The case was first heard by United States District Judge Peter K. Leisure in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The USFL claimed that the NFL had bullied ABC, CBS and NBC into not televising USFL games in the fall. It also claimed that the NFL had a specific plan to eliminate the USFL, the &quot;Porter Presentation.&quot; In particular, the USFL claimed the NFL conspired to ruin the Invaders and Generals. The USFL sought damages of $567 million, which would have been tripled to $1.7 billion under antitrust law. It hoped to void the NFL&#x27;s contracts with the three major networks. The USFL proposed two remedies: either force the NFL to negotiate new television contracts with only two networks, or force the NFL to split into two competing 14-team leagues, each limited to a contract with one major network.

The lawyer for the USFL, Harvey Myerson, had what he felt were three &quot;smoking guns&quot;.

# A memo from March 1973 to NFL broadcasting director Robert Cochran, from attorney Jay Moyer stating that an &quot;open network&quot; might be open to the &quot;invitation to formation of a new league.&quot;
# A memo from August 1983 from NFL management council executive director Jack Donlan to his staff. The memo laid out plans for NFL teams to &quot;increase salary offers to USFL to existing players or run the risk of losing them.&quot;
# A 1984 presentation to NFL executives by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter, which included a plan on &quot;how to conquer&quot; the United States Football League.

All but one of the league&#x27;s 28 teams was named as a co-defendant. Al Davis, owner of the then-Los Angeles Raiders, was a major witness for the USFL and his team had been excluded from the lawsuit in exchange for his testimony. ABC Sports&#x27; Howard Cosell was also a key witness for the USFL.

The case went to trial in the spring of 1986 and lasted 42 days. On July 29, a six-person jury nominally returned a verdict for the USFL. However, the jury&#x27;s findings were devastating to the upstart league. The jury declared the NFL a &quot;duly adjudicated illegal monopoly&quot;, and found that the NFL had willfully acquired and maintained monopoly status in professional football through predatory tactics. However, it rejected the USFL&#x27;s other claims. The jury found that the USFL had changed its strategy to a more risky goal of forcing a merger with the NFL. Furthermore, the switch to a fall schedule caused the loss of five major markets (Philadelphia, Denver, Houston, Pittsburgh, Detroit, the Bay Area) and derailed a move to a sixth (Miami). The jury also made note of a memo Tad Taube wrote about the dispute, which quoted the comic strip &quot;Pogo&quot;: &quot;we have met the enemy and he is us.&quot;

Most importantly, the jury found that the NFL did not attempt to force the USFL off television. (Indeed, ESPN remained willing to carry USFL games in the fall, several of the league&#x27;s teams also had local broadcast contracts, and 1986 also happened to be the inaugural season of the Fox Broadcasting Company, a network that would establish itself as the nation&#x27;s fourth major broadcast network.) In essence, the jury felt that while the USFL was harmed by the NFL&#x27;s de facto monopolization of pro football in the United States, most of its problems were due to its own mismanagement. It awarded the USFL nominal damages of $1, which was tripled under antitrust law to $3.

When NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle and NFL broadcasting chief Val Pinchbeck initially heard the verdict, they were devastated; Pinchbeck later recalled that he thought Rozelle would have a heart attack. While on their way to the league office, however, they heard that the USFL had lost nearly all of its claims, and headed back to the courthouse.

The verdict was a classic Pyrrhic victory. The USFL had essentially staked its future on winning the suit, hoping to finance the move to the fall by forcing the NFL to pay a substantial settlement. It considered the television-related claims to be the heart of its case. On August 4—four days after the announcement of the verdict—the USFL owners voted to suspend operations for the 1986 season, with the intent of returning in 1987; the league accurately foresaw the 1987 players&#x27; strike and had hoped the strike would give the league access to star players. Players signed to contracts were free to sign with NFL (or other professional teams) immediately. Indeed, the NFL had held a draft in 1984 for teams to acquire the rights to USFL players, in the event of the league (or teams in the league) folding. However, it is unlikely the USFL would have been able to put together a viable product in any case. Many of its players had signed contracts with NFL teams after the 1985 season, and the league was some $160 million in debt.

Five days after the verdict, the Tampa Bay Bandits were effectively shut down when a judge placed a lien on the franchise to satisfy back pay owed to former player Bret Clark. All of the team&#x27;s remaining assets were seized to satisfy the debt. In a desperation move, the Arizona Outlaws arranged a meeting in January 1987 with officials with the Canadian Football League hoping to negotiate a merger between the USFL and CFL; the CFL&#x27;s owners were &quot;lukewarm&quot; and ultimately rejected the offer. With nearly all of its players under contract to the NFL and CFL, Usher announced the league would stay shuttered in 1987 as well. (Many of the USFL players who were not under NFL contract would end up playing in fall 1987 as replacement players during the strike.)

The USFL unsuccessfully appealed the award to a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which affirmed the district court&#x27;s judgment in 1988. United States Circuit Judge Ralph K. Winter wrote the panel&#x27;s opinion. This decision ended any chance of the USFL returning to the field, and the league&#x27;s six remaining teams (the Outlaws had already decided not to return) voted to formally disband shortly afterward. However, because the USFL was at least nominally the winner of the lawsuit, the NFL was required to cover the USFL&#x27;s attorney fees and costs of litigation, and the USFL was awarded over $5.5 million in attorney fees and over $62,000 in court costs. That award was appealed by the NFL; it was affirmed on appeal and ultimately allowed to stand by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1990, four years after the USFL had ceased operations.

The USFL finally received a check for $3.76 in damages in 1990, the additional 76¢ representing interest earned while litigation had continued. Notably, that check has never been cashed.

===Aftermath===
The USFL had a significant impact on the NFL both on the field and off. Almost all of the USFL&#x27;s on-field innovations were eventually adopted by the older league, and a multitude of star players in the USFL would go on to enjoy very successful careers in the National Football League.

The NFL would also eventually have franchises in some of the USFL markets which had proved fertile for pro football or showed renewed interest in the game. Jacksonville, in particular, was being courted by the Houston Oilers as a potential relocation destination as early as 1987; that city eventually got the expansion Jaguars in 1995. The Oilers would instead relocate to Tennessee in 1997, playing temporarily for one season in Memphis (to minuscule crowds) before moving to Nashville to become the Tennessee Titans. Although the USFL&#x27;s stay in Baltimore was brief, the city&#x27;s acceptance of the Stars, coupled with the success of the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Baltimore Stallions a decade later, were factors in Art Modell&#x27;s decision to relocate his Cleveland Browns NFL franchise to Baltimore to become the Baltimore Ravens in 1996. Phoenix was never one of the USFL&#x27;s strongest markets but still managed to lure the former St. Louis Football Cardinals to take up residence in Arizona in 1988. Oakland saw the return of the Raiders to its city one decade after the demise of the USFL (the team moved again, to Las Vegas, in 2020). Other cities that did not get NFL franchises, such as Birmingham, Memphis, Orlando, and San Antonio, would receive teams in numerous short-lived or international pro football leagues in the years that have followed, such as the WLAF, CFL, the first XFL, UFL, and AAF. The 2022 revival of the USFL began with eight franchises that were in existence during the 1984 USFL season, including the Birmingham Stallions. Also, three decades after the USFL&#x27;s failure, the NFL played the 2017 Pro Bowl in Orlando.

Outside the NFL, Tampa&#x27;s embrace of Bandit Ball and the rapid growth of the Sun Belt prompted the establishment of other major league teams in the Tampa Bay area: the National Hockey League&#x27;s Lightning and Major League Baseball&#x27;s Devil Rays (later renamed the Rays).

The collapse of the USFL had a particularly positive effect on the NFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills. The Bills, as a small-market NFL franchise, were particularly hard-hit by the USFL; as its players from the moderately successful early 1980s era aged, the team was unable to find quality replacements for them on the free agent market, as the USFL was drawing away much of pro football&#x27;s top talent (including Bills running back Joe Cribbs and the team&#x27;s planned franchise quarterback of the future, Jim Kelly). With subpar talent, the Bills went 4–28 over the course of 1984 and 1985, and average attendance at Rich Stadium plummeted to under 30,000 fans per game, putting the team&#x27;s long-term viability in jeopardy. When the USFL collapsed, the Bills signed a large number of former USFL players: Kelly, Kent Hull, Ray Bentley, special teams coach Bruce DeHaven, general manager Bill Polian and coach Marv Levy, which, combined with the high draft picks compiled during the USFL years, would allow the Bills to rise to perennial Super Bowl contenders by the early 1990s. In 2014, after founding owner Ralph Wilson died, Trump tried to purchase the Bills, but was largely rebuffed in favor of Terry Pegula, who bid $400 million more for the team. In a 2015 interview with Sports Illustrated, Trump claimed that if he had bought the Bills in 2014, he &quot;probably would not be&quot; running for President of the United States the following year.

The league also had an indirect impact on the scheduling of televised football games. The USFL had planned to go against the NFL in the fall of 1986 without directly playing its games opposite the larger league by playing its games on Sunday nights, when the NFL did not play yet. One year later, ESPN and the NFL launched &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; in the time slot.

The last player of the USFL on an NFL roster was Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars punter Sean Landeta, who was signed in late 1986 by the New York Giants. He officially announced his retirement on March 6, 2008, the 25th anniversary of the first USFL game. (He last played in 2006 but he did not officially retire during the 2007 season.) The last non-kicker to retire was quarterback Doug Flutie, who played in both the CFL and NFL until 2005.

==Rule changes==
The USFL, compared to other professional leagues of the late 20th and 21st centuries, did not radically change the rules of the game; its rules largely resembled a hybrid of the NFL and college football rulebooks. The league&#x27;s rule on stopping the clock was one example of this hybrid approach: outside the two-minute warning, the clock ran between plays after a first down like in the NFL, while after the warning, it stopped between the end of the play that earned a first down and the placement of the ball back into play (to allow the chain crew to get into place), as is done in college football. Like college football, it recognized the two-point conversion (that was, at that time, only recognized in the CFL at the professional level) that would not be put into NFL rules until . Unlike other American professional football leagues (but like the NCAA then and the CFL), the USFL allowed the usage of a small, plastic &quot;tee&quot; for extra point and field goal attempts.

For its final season in 1985, the USFL used a method of challenging officials&#x27; rulings on the field via instant replay, using a system that is almost identical to that used by the NFL today; the NFL would adopt its first instant replay system (but in a different form from its current one instituted in 1999) in 1986; it would be used until 1991.

===1986 proposal===
Prior to the jury award in &quot;USFL v. NFL&quot;, the league had planned to go forward with a 1986 season with eight teams, divided into an &quot;Independence Division&quot; and a &quot;Liberty Division&quot;:
* Independence Division
** Arizona Outlaws
** Jacksonville Bulls1
** Orlando Renegades
** Tampa Bay Bandits

* Liberty Division
** Baltimore Stars
** Birmingham Stallions
** Memphis Showboats
** New Jersey Generals2
1 merged with Denver Gold
2 merged with Houston Gamblers

Due to the legal aftermath of the failed lawsuit against the NFL, the USFL folded and this divisional format never came to fruition.

Out of the 23 USFL teams, only five played for the league&#x27;s entire three-season duration without relocating or changing team names: Denver Gold, Los Angeles Express, Birmingham Stallions, New Jersey Generals, and Tampa Bay Bandits. Only the latter three teams would have remained on this list if the league had continued in 1986.

==Championship games==
The 1985 game was originally to be played at the Pontiac Silverdome, but after the Panthers merged with Oakland, the game was awarded to Giants Stadium.

Had there been a 1986 season, the championship game was scheduled to be played at Jacksonville&#x27;s Gator Bowl Stadium on February 1, 1987.

The USFL&#x27;s championship trophy had a silver USFL-logoed helmet with a gold facemask, mounted on a marble base by a swooping silver armature. On the base were mounted gold plaques with the names and scores of the teams in the USFL Championship Games. Like the NHL&#x27;s Stanley Cup and the CFL&#x27;s Grey Cup, but unlike the NFL&#x27;s Vince Lombardi Trophy for their Super Bowl championship game, it was loaned to the winning team for one year rather than a new trophy being made each year for the winning team to keep. After the Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars won the final USFL championship in 1985, General Manager Carl Peterson kept the trophy, and donated it to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Drafts==
The USFL held its 1983, 1985 and 1986 college drafts at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York. The 1984 draft was held at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York. The 1983–85 drafts were in January while the 1986 draft was held in May.

The USFL held an expansion draft in September 1983 for the 6 expansion teams that started play in 1984. In December 1984, they had a dispersal draft for Chicago, Pittsburgh, Oklahoma and Michigan.

In addition to the four college drafts, the league also held three USFL Territorial Drafts that allowed teams to select collegiate players from within their geographic area before they entered the general collegiate draft.

===First overall pick in college drafts===
Of the four first overall draft picks in its history, only 1984 top pick Mike Rozier actually played in the USFL. Dan Marino and Jerry Rice chose to play in the NFL, where they were also picked in the first round by the Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers, respectively, and each went on to have Hall of Fame careers. The USFL ceased operations soon after the 1986 draft, so Mike Haight never signed with nor played in the league, instead being drafted by the NFL&#x27;s New York Jets.

<text>Diaper is any of a wide range of decorative patterns used in a variety of works of art, such as stained glass, heraldic shields, architecture, and silverwork. Its chief use is in the enlivening of plain surfaces.

==Etymology==
For the full etymology, see &quot;&quot;. The Oxford dictionary gives the Greek &quot;dia&quot; for &quot;cross&quot; as in &quot;diamond&quot; or &quot;diagonal&quot;; and &quot;aspros&quot;, Greek for &quot;white&quot;. A white diamond or white cloth is used on the diagonal, hence the diagonal lattice or reticulation in patterning.

==In art==

In architecture and other decorative arts, diaper is applied as a decorative treatment of a surface with a repeat pattern of squares (chequers), rectangles, or lozenges. Diaper was particularly used in medieval stained glass to increase the vividness of a coloured pane, for example the field in a shield of arms. A stone wall may be decorated with such a pattern sculpted in relief; in brickwork the effect may be achieved by using bricks of different colours, or by allowing certain bricks to protrude from the wall&#x27;s surface to create a regular diamond-shaped pattern. In English flushwork, limestone and dark knapped flint are used. Windows may be set in a diamond-shaped lattice. In the manuscripts the diapering was used as an alternative to the gold ground primarily from the late 13th to 15th century, eventually replaced by the landscape background.

In Chinese carved lacquer, a convention developed by which the areas of sky, water and floor or ground that would be left largely blank in paintings are filled in with discreet patterns derived from textiles, known as &quot;diaper backgrounds&quot; and also &quot;brocade-grounds&quot; ( , ‘embroidery[-like] background’); this convention has continued to modern times. They are also used on porcelains, especially borders.

== Textiles ==
Diaper in textiles refers to richly decorated fabrics with a small geometrical or floral pattern that consists of the constant repetition of one or more simple figures or units of design evenly spaced. The term was initially associated with silk with diamond patterns later applied to linen and cotton fabrics of similar designs.
==Heraldry==
In heraldry, diapering is a technique in which those who emblazon, draw, paint, or otherwise depict achievements of arms decorate large areas of flat colour by drawing crosshatches or arabesques. There is no standard, and each artist is allowed individual idiosyncrasies.

===Excluded from blazon===
With very rare exceptions, diapering is not a part of the blazon, but is mere decoration, or ornamental accessory. Thus a shield with diapering is considered the same as a shield of the same design but without diapering. For this reason diapering must not be so obtrusive or so heavily drawn that it could be mistaken for a substantive charge or for a variation of the field. This is especially the case with diaper of simple cross-hatching which might be mistaken for a field of lozengy.

===Exceptions===

<text>The Atlantic City Surf were a professional minor league baseball team based in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The Surf was most recently a member of the Can-Am League, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball. The Surf played its home games at Surf Stadium, which was formerly known as &quot;The Sandcastle&quot; and &quot;Bernie Robbins Stadium&quot;

From 1998 to 2006, the Surf played in the South Division of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. While in the Atlantic League, the Surf won the first-ever Atlantic League championship in 1998 while also hosting the inaugural Atlantic League All-Star game.

On March 30, 2009, the Atlantic City Surf organization ceased operations, leaving the Can-Am League with six teams. Players from the team were made available in an April 3, 2009 dispersal draft.

On May 17, 2018, Atlantic City&#x27;s City Council authorized Frank Boulton, the former owner of the Atlantic City Surf (Independent Professional, Can-Am League/Atlantic League) to find an ownership group willing to bring minor league baseball back to Surf Stadium. The team was to compete in the 2019 season — however success quickly became &quot;unlikely&quot; and there currently are no indications that professional baseball will return to Atlantic City. 

==Earlier Atlantic City baseball teams==
Atlantic City historically has never enjoyed much success as a venue for professional sports teams and baseball has been no exception. The city hosted a few short-lived, unnamed teams in various leagues in the 19th century, then provided a home for the defunct Lancaster Red Roses of the Tri-State League in 1912. The franchise played one more season in Atlantic City in 1913 before disbanding.

===Bacharach Giants===
In 1916, the Bacharach Giants moved to Atlantic City. Originally known as the Duval Giants of Jacksonville, Florida, its name was changed to the Bacharach Giants in honor of the city&#x27;s mayor, Harry Bacharach. The team was independent from 1916 to 1922, then became a member of the Eastern Colored League from 1923 until the league&#x27;s folding during the 1928 season, winning the league in 1926 and 1927 under the leadership of Dick Lundy. Other notable players for the Giants included Oliver Marcelle, Smokey Joe Williams, &quot;Pop&quot; Lloyd, and Arthur &quot;Rats&quot; Henderson. The team became affiliated with the American Negro League in 1929, and continued in the Negro National League in 1932, when it folded as a professional team.

==Atlantic City Surf==
In 1998, the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball placed a team in Atlantic City called the Surf. Opening their new ballpark called The Sandcastle on May 20, the Surf was defeated by the Somerset Patriots by a score of 8-5. Playing host to the first Atlantic League All-Star game on July 15, the Surf defeated the League All-Stars 6-4 and would later win the league&#x27;s first Championship Series over the Bridgeport Bluefish, three games to one. The Surf made it to the post-season four times in five years (2002 and 2004–06) but were eliminated in the first round each time.

In 2007, the Surf moved from the Atlantic League to the Can-Am League. In 2007 the Surf made the playoffs in their inaugural season in the Can-Am. The team managed by Chris Carminucci finished with the 2nd best overall record of 51-41. In the playoffs lost to the North Shore Spirit 3 games to 1 in the opening round. The Surf received many awards in 2007. Carminucci received manager of the year. Starting pitcher Brian Rodaway received Pitcher of the Year Award after finishing a league-best 15-3. Relief pitcher Matt Pike received the Reliever of the Year award for his league leading 24 saves. In 2008 the Surf hired Cecil Fielder as the team manager. The Surf continued their success finishing 51-43 (4th overall record) and once again in the playoffs, this time losing to the Quebec Capitales 3 games to 1 in the opening round.

On March 30, 2009, the Can-Am League announced the Surf would not be operating in the 2009 season due to the collapse of the proposed sale of the team and lack of ownership to continue for the 2009 season. The Surf joined fellow league member Ottawa Voyageurs in ceasing operations for the 2009 season.

<doc id="65530" wikidata="Q1413371" url="?curid=65530" title="Democratic Party – demokraci.pl">
<text>The Democratic Party (), abbreviated to PD, was a minor social-liberal political party in Poland. It had no members of the Sejm, Senate, or European Parliament.

Its foundation was publicly announced on 28 February 2005 and formally established on 9 May 2005 as an &#x27;enlargement&#x27; of the Freedom Union, which it legally succeeded. At the 2007 election to the Sejm, the party ran as part of the Left and Democrats (LiD) list, and won three of the alliance&#x27;s 53 seats. These members left the party in 2009 to join the newly revived Democratic Party. The party was dissolved on 12 November 2016 to form Union of European Democrats.

The party was a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Party.

==History==

===Foundation===
The Democratic Party was formed on the initiative of Freedom Union chairman Władysław Frasyniuk, together with the social-democratic economist Jerzy Hausner, until recently a member of the governing post-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), and prominent Christian democrat, former UW member Tadeusz Mazowiecki. It was since strongly supported, but thus far not yet officially joined, by then Prime Minister Marek Belka and centrist members of the Democratic Left Alliance. Although it attracted considerable media attention and support from many Polish intellectuals, it received only 2.5% of the vote (and no seats in parliament) in the Polish parliamentary election in October 2005.

===Characteristics===
The core of the Democratic Party is made up by the members of the Freedom Union (&quot;Unia Wolności&quot;, UW), which had so far been the most important Christian democratic group in the Polish political landscape. Since its inception in 1994, the UW had to cope with internal frictions between various factions: liberals (such as Leszek Balcerowicz), those proposing a more liberal economic agenda in a more conservative, bourgeois guise (such as Donald Tusk), more progressive social democrats such as Jacek Kuroń, and intellectual former civil rights activists such as Bronisław Geremek or Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who also has a strong background in liberal Catholicism and leans towards Christian democracy.

In 2001, these frictions – combined with the prospect of a devastating defeat in the upcoming election – led to an exodus of conservative and liberal conservative members around Tusk who joined former members of the UW&#x27;s senior coalition partner, the conservative Solidarity Electoral Action, to form the new party Civic Platform.

===2001 Election failure===
In the 2001 general elections, the Freedom Union received only 3.1% and thus failed to cross the 5% threshold required to gain entry to Parliament. With Władysław Frasyniuk replacing Geremek as chairman, the Freedom Union continued to exist as a centrist party, but lost much of its relevance in Polish politics. It was enjoying the support of approximately 3% of voters, to fall to 1% and below in 2009.

===European election success===
However, probably due to low voter turnout, the party managed to cross the required 5% threshold in the 2004 European Parliament elections, receiving 7% of votes and 4 out of 54 seats reserved for Poland in the European Parliament as part of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, of which it is a member.

===After 2005===
On 29 February 2005, Frasyniuk came out with the initiative to merge the UW into a new social-liberal party to be called &quot;the Democrats&quot;, which he presented with Mazowiecki and Jerzy Hausner. Mazowiecki had left the UW in November 2002 after it had left the conservative and Christian democratic European People&#x27;s Party in favour of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, and entered coalitions with the social-democratic Democratic Left Alliance and the right-wing populist Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland party on the local level.

===Alliance with postcommunists===
Hausner, on the other hand, is an economist with a post-communist background. As minister of economic affairs and employment in the governments of Leszek Miller and Marek Belka, he conceived the so-called Hausner Plan (&quot;Plan Hausnera&quot;), a programme for market-socialist reform concerning state-owned business, public administration, and social security. After his reform met with persistent opposition, he left the SLD in a much debated move on 7 February 2005 and resigned from office on 30 March 2005.

From the beginning, Frasyniuk, Hausner and Mazowiecki appealed to Prime Minister Marek Belka to join the party. Belka, another former SLD member, had left the party in the early 1990s, but joined Leszek Miller&#x27;s government as a non-party minister of economic affairs in 2001 before resigning the following year. After an interlude as economic director in the interim coalition administration of Iraq in 2003, Belka returned to Poland to become non-party head of an SLD minority government in 2004.

The involvement of Hausner and Belka as prominent post-communists marks a first in Polish politics: for the first time, a political party is created by members of the former communist government and former opposition members. Also, while the UW was a somewhat elitist party appealing mostly to educated and affluent urban voters, the PD is trying to establish itself as a populist party with a broad appeal, which caters for centrist social-liberals (Frasyniuk), pragmatic centrists with leanings toward economic liberalism (Hausner) and centrist Christian democrats (Mazowiecki).

As of 27 May 2005, the party claimed to have 13,000+ members, out of which 8,000 were members of the Freedom Union. It defined itself as, &quot;above all, a group of young people not previously involved in politics, which at the same time is drawing on the best traditions of the liberal-democratic milieu around the Freedom Union&quot; . Despite this statement the party is made of several former politicians, who had run Poland before, as well as including ex-members of SLD who left the party when it faced a corruption crisis.

A manifesto entitled &quot;Development through Democracy&quot; issued by the party in February 2005 was signed by a broad range of Polish intellectuals and artists, including Paweł Huelle (writer), Marek Edelman (physician, last surviving leader of the Warsaw Ghetto Rising), Agnieszka Holland (director), Marek Kondrat (actor), Kazimierz Kutz (director), Jan Miodek (linguist), Daniel Olbrychski (actor), Jerzy Pilch (writer), Henryk Samsonowicz (historian), Jerzy Szacki (sociologist). Lech Wałęsa&#x27;s son Jarosław Wałęsa also signed the manifesto.

===After 2006===
In 2006, the party created the Left and Democrats (LiD) political coalition with the Democratic Left Alliance, Social Democracy of Poland and Labour Union. It continued to join the coalition for the parliamentary elections 2007. It gained 3 parliamentary seats in the lower chamber of Polish Diet. The coalition was ended in March 2008, and 3 democratic members of parliament formed their own parliamentary group.

The Democrats gathered only 25,937 votes in the 2009 European elections, reaching similar support as the newly founded Polish green party Greens 2004. This outcome was seen as a defeat. In June 2009 two of the elected parliamentarists left the party. On 10 January, Brygida Kuźniak became a new leader of Democrats, beating former deputy leader Bogdan Lis. Currently, also the third parliamentarist switched to the Democratic Party (&quot;Stronnictwo Demokratyczne&quot;), as well as many prominent leaders that do not share the new shift in party&#x27;s ideology.

The party joined the Europa Plus political alliance on 24 June 2013.

On 12 November 2016, the party was dissolved and merged with the European Democrats club at the Sejm to form a new party called Union of European Democrats, which is generally less progressive and more moderate conservative than Democratic Party was.

==Ideology==
The party was a direct successor of the Freedom Union and attempted to extend the original voter coalition of the Freedom Union by left-leaning voter groups. The party wanted to appeal to the urban, liberal middle class, and its proposals included a creation of a special metropolitan voivodeship for Warsaw. At the same time, it worked with social democratic parties, such as the Democratic Left Alliance and Social Democracy of Poland, although there were few proposals all three parties agreed to, such as the need to bail out indebted hospitals and to build an anti-missile shield in Poland. The Democratic Party however also stressed its distance to centre-left parties, and stressed its ideological centrism.

Key proposals of the party include:
*Support for the European constitution in the referendum in October 2005
*Tax cuts, introduction of an 18% flat tax on incomes
*Reduction of non-wage labour costs, tax remissions for business starters
*Creation of new jobs, e.g. through a first-year exemption from social security contributions for graduate entrants
*Appointment of an ombudsman to represent entrepreneurs damnified by fiscal or other authorities
*Increased spending on education
*Studentship funds for rural youth
*Compulsory education starting at age 6 (presently 7), popularisation of instruction in two foreign languages at primary school level
*Improvement and nationwide standardisation of health services
*Establishment of a public hospital network not subject to privatisation
*Reduction in telecommunication costs to facilitate Internet access

==Popular support==
The Freedom Union&#x27;s transformation into the Democratic Party has not significantly increased voter support for the centrists, which since autumn 2004 has been oscillating between 3% and 6%. In June 2005, it was at 4% and has since deteriorated; in the parliamentary elections of September 2005, it reached 2.5%, failing to overcome the election threshold of 5%. Because the party received less than 3%, it does not receive refunds of its campaign costs. It also lacks significant presence in the media as a consequence of its poor election result, which has further diminished its appeal. In December 2005, the party merely reached 1% of support in a poll. As a result, some political observers question the party&#x27;s ability to further continue in its present shape.

===Sejm===
===Senate===
==Criticism==
The Democratic Party has attracted criticism from other former oppositionists from communist times, who criticise that the party accepts former members of the post-communist SLD, and strongly opposes the large-scale vetting of officials and politicians (see Bronisław Wildstein) aimed at eliminating former state agents from political life. Also, the party&#x27;s formal electoral and later parliamentary coalition with SLD, Left and Democrats, which lasted from 2006 until 2008, has been seen as disloyalty of Solidarity&#x27;s ideals by many.

<text>The Bridgeport Bluefish were an American minor league baseball team based in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The team was a member of the Liberty Division of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, which was not affiliated with Major League Baseball. They played their home games at The Ballpark at Harbor Yard from 1998 to 2017.

The franchise had announced it would relocate to High Point, North Carolina, in 2019, but ceased operations instead. In its place, a new franchise not connected to the Bluefish began play in High Point called the High Point Rockers.

==History of Bridgeport baseball==
The game of baseball was first played in Bridgeport, Connecticut soon after the Civil War ended. Teams that called the city home included the Victors, Soubrettes, Orators, Crossmen, Mechanics, Hustlers, Bolts, Americans, Bees, and Bears. Bridgeport was the home of Major Leaguer James &quot;Orator&quot; O&#x27;Rourke, who signed the first African-American to play for a professional baseball team in 1895.

Visiting Major League and Negro league teams often played exhibition games in the shadow of the Bridgeport&#x27;s smokestacks. The last affiliated minor league baseball team, the Bridgeport Bees, played in the Interstate League and the Colonial League from 1941 to 1950. Professional baseball was not played in Bridgeport for about another half-century, until the arrival of the Bluefish in 1998.

===Bridgeport Bluefish===
The first game of the Bridgeport Bluefish was May 21, 1998. The team has been to five Atlantic League Championship Series. It won in 1999 against the Somerset Patriots and lost to Atlantic City in 1998, Newark in 2002, Lancaster in 2006, and York in 2010.

Some of the former major leaguers who have worn Bluefish jerseys include Endy Chávez, Shea Hillenbrand, Alex Hinshaw, José Offerman, Edgardo Alfonzo, Deivi Cruz, Junior Spivey, Quinton McCracken, Antonio Alfonseca, Willy Mo Pena, Joey Gathright, Adam Greenberg, and Mariano Duncan.

The Bluefish won their first league championship in 1999, led by their inaugural manager, and long time major leaguer – Willie Upshaw. The Bluefish have won the most games in Atlantic League history. The land under The Ballpark at Harbor Yard was purchased by the city of Bridgeport from Donald Trump for $1 and with the forgiveness of back taxes owed on the property. The Jenkins Valve plant was demolished to make way for the stadium. The success of the Bluefish led to redevelopment of the South End, including construction of the Arena at Harbor Yard and a multiuse parking garage.

The founders of the Bluefish were Mickey Herbert, Jack McGregor, Mary–Jane Foster, and the Bridgeport Waterfront Investors. Herbert anchored the team through a mayoral scandal and difficult financial circumstances. Prior to the 2006 season, the franchise was purchased by Get Hooked, LLC, a group of investors from Fairfield County that included McGregor and Foster. However, Get Hooked dropped the Bluefish prior to the 2008 season in favor of seeking a new ballpark for the city of Yonkers, New York. The Bluefish were purchased by Frank Boulton, who is also the owner of the Long Island Ducks and the founder of the Atlantic League.

The Bluefish became the first team in Atlantic League history to record 1,000 victories as a franchise in 2012. On June 27, 2012, the team defeated the York Revolution 2–1 at the Ballpark at Harbor Yard to capture the victory.

For one day in May 2016, Jennie Finch was a guest manager for the Bluefish, thus becoming the first woman to manage a professional baseball team. The team played and won one game that day.

In April 2017, the City of High Point, North Carolina, approved $15 million from the city budget to begin land acquisition and engineering studies for a new $45 million, publicly funded stadium to be financed through limited-obligation tax bonds. The stadium was expected to be the new home for the Bluefish in 2019. It had yet to be determined where (or if) the Bluefish would play in 2018.

On August 8, 2017, the Bluefish announced that the 2017 season would be the team&#x27;s last in Bridgeport. On September 17, the Bluefish played the final game in their 20-year history at the Ballpark at Harbor Yard, losing 9–2 to the Somerset Patriots. Despite having the best overall record in the Liberty Division, the Bluefish missed the playoffs, as they finished one game back of the Patriots in the first–half standings and two games back of their cross-sound rival Long Island Ducks in the second half.

Though it had been planned for the Bluefish to relocate to High Point, later the team ceased operations at the end of the 2017 season. High Point got an expansion franchise that is not connected to the Bluefish (the High Point Rockers).

The Ballpark at Harbor Yard was converted to a concert venue known as Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater. A groundbreaking ceremony for the replacement amphitheater was held in July 2018. The amphitheater opened July 28, 2021.

==Logos and uniforms==
The official colors of the Bridgeport Bluefish were navy blue, teal, and silver. The primary logo consisted of the &quot;Bluefish&quot; wordmark in navy blue with white and teal outline superimposed over a depiction of a cartoon bluefish holding a baseball bat.

The primary cap was navy blue with a teal brim and button, with the cap logo depicting a bluefish interwoven with a capital &quot;B&quot; centered on the front. The home jersey was white with traditional navy blue piping below the collar and around the sleeves. The &quot;Bluefish&quot; wordmark is centered across the front in navy blue with white outline and teal drop shadow. The away jersey is grey with navy blue piping, and the &quot;Bridgeport&quot; wordmark centered across the front in navy blue with a white and teal outline. The Bluefish also have a teal alternate jersey, with navy piping with the &quot;fishhook&quot; wordmark centered across the front.

==Season-by-season records==
* 1 Atlantic League Championship (1999)
* 5 Division Championships (1998, 1999, 2002, 2006, 2010)

==Ferry Cup==
The Bridgeport Bluefish contend with the Long Island Ducks over the Ferry Cup, which is sponsored by the Bridgeport &amp; Port Jefferson Steamboat Company. The two teams border on Long Island Sound, and many fans of both teams regularly cross it to support them. The Ducks currently hold the Ferry Cup by winning the 2011 season series 12–6. As of 2011 the Bluefish-Ducks rivalry record is 114–112, in favor of Bridgeport.

==Mascots==
One of the Bridgeport Bluefish official mascots is an anthropomorphic bluefish named B.B. He wears the team&#x27;s alternate jersey (number 98) with black sneakers. B.B. was born on May 29, 1997, in Cape Hatteras. He later migrated to the Long Island Sound and joined the Bluefish soon after. The mascot&#x27;s name alludes to the initials of the team and its nickname.

Captain L.I Sounder is another source of entertainment at the Harbor Yard. He wears a uniform of a sailor. L.I Sounder&#x27;s name referred to the nautical rank of captain and a name for a Long Island Sound resident. Sounder occasionally appears at Bluefish home games.

== Retired numbers ==

; 42 (Jackie Robinson): 2B, Retired throughout professional baseball on April 15, 1997

; 21 (Roberto Clemente): RF, Retired by the Bluefish in 2006

; 19 (Luis Lopez): 3B, Retired by the Bluefish on September 19, 2015,

==Guest managers==
On several occasions, the Bluefish had promotional nights in which former baseball players and managers, as well as other celebrities, have been enlisted to serve as guest managers.

<text>The Camden Riversharks were an American professional baseball team based in Camden, New Jersey, from 2001 to 2015. They were a member of the Liberty Division of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, which was not at that time affiliated with Major League Baseball. The Riversharks played their home games at Campbell&#x27;s Field, which was situated at the base of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. Due to its location on the Delaware River, the ballpark offered a clear view of the Philadelphia skyline. The &quot;Riversharks&quot; name referred to the location of Camden on the Delaware River, and the primary logo incorporated the Benjamin Franklin Bridge that links Camden to Philadelphia.

On October 21, 2015, the Camden Riversharks announced they would cease operations immediately due to the inability to reach an agreement on lease terms with the owner of Campbell&#x27;s Field, the Camden County Improvement Authority (the authority had purchased Campbell&#x27;s Field from Rutgers University two months prior). 

The Riversharks were replaced by the New Britain Bees, a separate franchise for the 2016 season.

== History of Camden baseball ==

The Riversharks were not the first baseball team to call Camden home. The Camden Merritt, named for former state senator Albert Merritt, of the Interstate Association played there in 1883, and disbanded the same year. Another team from the Tri-State League played in Camden in 1904, and they too disbanded, during the season. The inception of the Riversharks in 2001 was the first professional baseball team in Camden since the 1904 season.

==Logos and uniforms==

The team colors of the Camden Riversharks were navy blue, Columbia blue, and white. The Riversharks&#x27; last logo, introduced in 2005 with a new ownership group, consisted of a shark biting a baseball bat superimposed over a stylized depiction of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. The Riversharks&#x27; former logo, used from 2001 to 2005, consisted of a navy blue ring with a shark centered above the wordmark superimposed over it.

The Riversharks&#x27; primary caps were navy blue with a Columbia blue visor and the &quot;shark-fin&quot; cap logo centered on the front. The home jerseys were white with navy blue piping and feature the &quot;Sharks&quot; wordmark across the front in white with navy blue and Columbia blue outline. The away jerseys were gray with the &quot;Camden&quot; wordmark centered across the jersey in navy blue with Columbia blue outline.

<text>A business model describes how a business organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social, cultural or other contexts. The model describes the specific way in which the business conducts itself, spends, and earns money in a way that generates profit. The process of business model construction and modification is also called &quot;business model innovation&quot; and forms a part of business strategy.

In theory and practice, the term &quot;business model&quot; is used for a broad range of informal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects of an organization or business, including purpose, business process, target customers, offerings, strategies, infrastructure, organizational structures, profit structures, sourcing, trading practices, and operational processes and policies including culture.
==Context==
The literature has provided very diverse interpretations and definitions of a business model. A systematic review and analysis of manager responses to a survey defines business models as the design of organizational structures to enact a commercial opportunity. Further extensions to this design logic emphasize the use of narrative or coherence in business model descriptions as mechanisms by which entrepreneurs create extraordinarily successful growth firms.

Business models are used to describe and classify businesses, especially in an entrepreneurial setting, but they are also used by managers inside companies to explore possibilities for future development. Well-known business models can operate as &quot;recipes&quot; for creative managers. Business models are also referred to in some instances within the context of accounting for purposes of public reporting.

== History ==
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term &quot;business model&quot;, a compound of business and model, was first used in 1832 in the sense of &quot;a plan for the operation of a business&quot;.

Over the years, business models have become much more sophisticated. The &quot;bait and hook&quot; business model (also referred to as the &quot;razor and blades business model&quot; or the &quot;tied products business model&quot;) was introduced in the early 20th century. This involves offering a basic product at a very low cost, often at a loss (the &quot;bait&quot;), then charging compensatory recurring amounts for refills or associated products or services (the &quot;hook&quot;). Examples include: razor (bait) and blades (hook); cell phones (bait) and air time (hook); computer printers (bait) and ink cartridge refills (hook); and cameras (bait) and prints (hook). A variant of this model was employed by Adobe, a software developer that gave away its document reader free of charge but charged several hundred dollars for its document writer.

In the 1950s, new business models came from McDonald&#x27;s Restaurants and Toyota. In the 1960s, the innovators were Wal-Mart and Hypermarkets. The 1970s saw new business models from FedEx and Toys R Us; the 1980s from Blockbuster, Home Depot, Intel, and Dell Computer; the 1990s from Southwest Airlines, Netflix, eBay, Amazon.com, and Starbucks.

Today, the type of business models might depend on how technology is used. For example, entrepreneurs on the internet have also created new models that depend entirely on existing or emergent technology. Using technology, businesses can reach a large number of customers with minimal costs. In addition, the rise of outsourcing and globalization has meant that business models must also account for strategic sourcing, complex supply chains and moves to collaborative, relational contracting structures.

==Theoretical and empirical insights==
===Design logic and narrative coherence===
Design logic views the business model as an outcome of creating new organizational structures or changing existing structures to pursue a new opportunity. Gerry George and Adam Bock (2011) conducted a comprehensive literature review and surveyed managers to understand how they perceived the components of a business model. In that analysis these authors show that there is a design logic behind how entrepreneurs and managers perceive and explain their business model. In further extensions to the design logic, George and Bock (2012) use case studies and the IBM survey data on business models in large companies, to describe how CEOs and entrepreneurs create narratives or stories in a coherent manner to move the business from one opportunity to another. They also show that when the narrative is incoherent or the components of the story are misaligned, that these businesses tend to fail. They recommend ways in which the entrepreneur or CEO can create strong narratives for change.

=== Complementarities between partnering firms ===
Berglund and Sandström (2013) argued that business models should be understood from an open systems perspective as opposed to being a firm-internal concern. Since innovating firms do not have executive control over their surrounding network, business model innovation tends to require soft power tactics with the goal of aligning heterogeneous interests. In a study of collaborative research and external sourcing of technology, Hummel et al. (2010) similarly found that in deciding on business partners, it is important to make sure that both parties&#x27; business models are complementary. For example, they found that it was important to identify the value drivers of potential partners by analyzing their business models, and that it is beneficial to find partner firms that understand key aspects of one&#x27;s own firm&#x27;s business model.

The University of Tennessee conducted research into highly collaborative business relationships. Researchers codified their research into a sourcing business model known as Vested Outsourcing, a hybrid sourcing business model in which buyers and suppliers in an outsourcing or business relationship focus on shared values and goals to create an arrangement that is highly collaborative and mutually beneficial to each.

== Categorization ==
From about 2012, some research and experimentation has theorized about a so-called &quot;liquid business model&quot;.

=== Shift from pipes to platforms ===
Sangeet Paul Choudary distinguishes between two broad families of business models in an article in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine. Choudary contrasts pipes (linear business models) with platforms (networked business models). In the case of pipes, firms create goods and services, push them out and sell them to customers. Value is produced upstream and consumed downstream. There is a linear flow, much like water flowing through a pipe. Unlike pipes, platforms do not just create and push stuff out. They allow users to create and consume value.

Alex Moazed, founder and CEO of Applico, defines a platform as a business model that creates value by facilitating exchanges between two or more interdependent groups, usually consumers and producers, of a given value. As a result of digital transformation, it is the predominant business model of the 21st century.

In an op-ed on MarketWatch, Choudary, Van Alstyne and Parker further explain how business models are moving from pipes to platforms, leading to disruption of entire industries.

=== Platform ===
There are three elements to a successful platform business model. The &quot;toolbox&quot; creates connection by making it easy for others to plug into the platform. This infrastructure enables interactions between participants. The &quot;magnet&quot; creates pull that attracts participants to the platform. For transaction platforms, both producers and consumers must be present to achieve critical mass. The &quot;matchmaker&quot; fosters the flow of value by making connections between producers and consumers. Data is at the heart of successful matchmaking, and distinguishes platforms from other business models.

Chen (2009) stated that the business model has to take into account the capabilities of Web 2.0, such as collective intelligence, network effects, user-generated content, and the possibility of self-improving systems. He suggested that the service industry such as the airline, traffic, transportation, hotel, restaurant, information and communications technology and online gaming industries will be able to benefit in adopting business models that take into account the characteristics of Web 2.0. He also emphasized that Business Model 2.0 has to take into account not just the technology effect of Web 2.0 but also the networking effect. He gave the example of the success story of Amazon in making huge revenues each year by developing an open platform that supports a community of companies that re-use Amazon&#x27;s on-demand commerce services.

==== Impacts of platform business models ====
Jose van Dijck (2013) identifies three main ways that media platforms choose to monetize, which mark a change from traditional business models. One is the subscription model, in which platforms charge users a small monthly fee in exchange for services. She notes that the model was ill-suited for those &quot;accustomed to free content and services&quot;, leading to a variant, the freemium model. A second method is via advertising. Arguing that traditional advertising is no longer appealing to people used to &quot;user-generated content and social networking&quot;, she states that companies now turn to strategies of customization and personalization in targeted advertising. Eric K. Clemons (2009) asserts that consumers no longer trust most commercial messages; Van Dijck argues platforms are able to circumvent the issue through personal recommendations from friends or influencers on social media platforms, which can serve as a more subtle form of advertisement. Finally, a third common business model is monetization of data and metadata generated from the use of platforms.

== Applications ==
Malone et al. found that some business models, as defined by them, indeed performed better than others in a dataset consisting of the largest U.S. firms, in the period 1998 through 2002, while they did not prove whether the existence of a business model mattered.

In the healthcare space, and in particular in companies that leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence, the design of business models is particularly challenging as there are a multitude of value creation mechanisms and a multitude of possible stakeholders. An emerging categorization has identified seven archetypes.

The concept of a business model has been incorporated into certain accounting standards. For example, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) utilizes an &quot;entity&#x27;s business model for managing the financial assets&quot; as a criterion for determining whether such assets should be measured at amortized cost or at fair value in its International Financial Reporting Standard, IFRS 9. In their 2013 proposal for accounting for financial instruments, the Financial Accounting Standards Board also proposed a similar use of business model for classifying financial instruments. The concept of business model has also been introduced into the accounting of deferred taxes under International Financial Reporting Standards with 2010 amendments to IAS 12 addressing deferred taxes related to investment property.

Both IASB and FASB have proposed using the concept of business model in the context of reporting a lessor&#x27;s lease income and lease expense within their joint project on accounting for leases. In its 2016 lease accounting model, IFRS 16, the IASB chose not to include a criterion of &quot;stand alone utility&quot; in its lease definition because &quot;entities might reach different conclusions for contracts that contain the same rights of use, depending on differences between customers&#x27; resources or suppliers&#x27; business models.&quot; The concept has also been proposed as an approach for determining the measurement and classification when accounting for insurance contracts. As a result of the increasing prominence the concept of business model has received in the context of financial reporting, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), which advises the European Union on endorsement of financial reporting standards, commenced a project on the &quot;Role of the Business Model in Financial Reporting&quot; in 2011.

==Design==
Business model design generally refers to the activity of designing a company&#x27;s business model. It is part of the business development and business strategy process and involves design methods. Massa and Tucci (2014) highlighted the difference between crafting a new business model when none is in place, as it is often the case with academic spinoffs and high technology entrepreneurship, and changing an existing business model, such as when the tooling company Hilti shifted from selling its tools to a leasing model. They suggested that the differences are so profound (for example, lack of resource in the former case and inertia and conflicts with existing configurations and organisational structures in the latter) that it could be worthwhile to adopt different terms for the two. They suggest business model design to refer to the process of crafting a business model when none is in place and business model reconfiguration for the process of changing an existing business model, also highlighting that the two processes are not mutually exclusive, meaning reconfiguration may involve steps which parallel those of designing a business model.

=== Economic consideration ===

Al-Debei and Avison (2010) consider value finance as one of the main dimensions of business modelling which depicts information related to costing, pricing methods, and revenue structure. Stewart and Zhao (2000) defined the business model as &quot;a statement of how a firm will make money and sustain its profit stream over time.&quot;

=== Component consideration ===

Osterwalder et al. (2005) consider the Business Model as the blueprint of how a company does business. Slywotzky (1996) regards the business model as &quot;the totality of how a company selects its customers, defines and differentiates it offerings, defines the tasks it will perform itself and those it will outsource, configures its resources, goes to market, creates utility for customers and captures profits.&quot;

=== Strategic outcome ===

Mayo and Brown (1999) considered the business model as &quot;the design of key interdependent systems that create and sustain a competitive business.&quot; Casadesus-Masanell and Ricart (2011) explain a business model as a set of &quot;choices (policy, assets and governance)&quot; and &quot;consequences (flexible and rigid)&quot; and underline the importance of considering &quot;how it interacts with models of other players in the industry&quot; instead of thinking of it in isolation.

== Definitions of design or development==
Zott and Amit (2009) consider business model design from the perspectives of design themes and design content. Design themes refer to the system&#x27;s dominant value creation drivers and design content examines in greater detail the activities to be performed, the linking and sequencing of the activities and who will perform the activities.

=== Design themes emphasis===

Developing a framework for business model development with an emphasis on design themes, Lim (2010) proposed the environment-strategy-structure-operations (ESSO) business model development which takes into consideration the alignment of the organization&#x27;s strategy with the organization&#x27;s structure, operations, and the environmental factors in achieving competitive advantage in varying combination of cost, quality, time, flexibility, innovation and affective.

=== Design content emphasis ===
Business model design includes the modeling and description of a company&#x27;s:
* value propositions
* target customer segments
* distribution channels
*customer relationships
* value configurations
* core capabilities
* commercial network
* partner network
* cost structure
* revenue model

A business model design template can facilitate the process of designing and describing a company&#x27;s business model. In a paper published in 2017, Johnson demonstrated how matrix methods may usefully be deployed to characterise the architecture of resources, costs, and revenues that a business uses to create and deliver value to customers which defines its business model. Systematisation of this technique (Johnson settles on a business genomic code of seven matrix elements of a business model) would support a taxonomical approach to empirical studies of business models in the same way that Linnaeus&#x27; taxonomy revolutionised biology.

Daas et al. (2012) developed a decision support system (DSS) for business model design. In their study a decision support system (DSS) is developed to help SaaS in this process, based on a design approach consisting of a design process that is guided by various design methods.

== Examples ==
In the early history of business models it was very typical to define business model types such as bricks-and-mortar or e-broker. However, these types usually describe only one aspect of the business (most often the revenue model). Therefore, more recent literature on business models concentrate on describing a business model as a whole, instead of only the most visible aspects.

The following examples provide an overview for various business model types that have been in discussion since the invention of term &quot;business model&quot;:

;Bricks and clicks business model: Business model by which a company integrates both offline (&quot;bricks&quot;) and online (&quot;clicks&quot;) presences. One example of the bricks-and-clicks model is when a chain of stores allows the user to order products online, but lets them pick up their order at a local store.
;Collective business models: Business system, organization or association typically composed of relatively large numbers of businesses, tradespersons or professionals in the same or related fields of endeavor, which pools resources, shares information or provides other benefits for their members. For example, a science park or high-tech campus provides shared resources (e.g. cleanrooms and other lab facilities) to the firms located on its premises, and in addition seeks to create an innovation community among these firms and their employees.
;Cutting out the middleman model: The removal of intermediaries in a supply chain: &quot;cutting out the middleman&quot;. Instead of going through traditional distribution channels, which had some type of intermediate (such as a distributor, wholesaler, broker, or agent), companies may now deal with every customer directly, for example via the Internet.
;Direct sales model: Direct selling is marketing and selling products to consumers directly, away from a fixed retail location. Sales are typically made through party plan, one-to-one demonstrations, and other personal contact arrangements. A text book definition is: &quot;The direct personal presentation, demonstration, and sale of products and services to consumers, usually in their homes or at their jobs.&quot;
;Distribution business models, various
;Fee in, free out: Business model which works by charging the first client a fee for a service, while offering that service free of charge to subsequent clients.
;Franchise: Franchising is the practice of using another firm&#x27;s successful business model. For the franchisor, the franchise is an alternative to building &#x27;chain stores&#x27; to &quot;distribute&quot; goods and avoid investment and liability over a chain. The franchisor&#x27;s success is the success of the franchisees. The franchisee is said to have a greater incentive than a direct employee because he or she has a direct stake in the business.
;: Sourcing Business Models are a systems-based approach to structuring supplier relationships. A sourcing business model is a type of business model that is applied to business relationships where more than one party needs to work with another party to be successful. There are seven sourcing business models that range from the transactional to investment-based. The seven models are: Basic Provider, Approved Provider, Preferred Provider, Performance-Based/Managed Services Model, Vested outsourcing Business Model, Shared Services Model, and Equity Partnership Model. Sourcing business models are targeted for procurement professionals who seek a modern approach to achieve the best fit between buyers and suppliers. Sourcing business model theory is based on a collaborative research effort by the University of Tennessee (UT), the Sourcing Industry Group (SIG), the Center for Outsourcing Research and Education (CORE), and the International Association for Contracts and Commercial Management (IACCM). This research formed the basis for the 2016 book, &quot;Strategic Sourcing in the New Economy: Harnessing the Potential of Sourcing Business Models in Modern Procurement&quot;.
;Freemium business model: Business model that works by offering basic Web services, or a basic downloadable digital product, for free, while charging a premium for advanced or special features.
;Pay what you can (PWYC): A non-profit or for-profit business model which does not depend on set prices for its goods, but instead asks customers to pay what they feel the product or service is worth to them. It is often used as a promotional tactic, but can also be the regular method of doing business. It is a variation on the gift economy and cross-subsidization, in that it depends on reciprocity and trust to succeed.: &quot;Pay what you want&quot; (PWYW) is sometimes used synonymously, but &quot;pay what you can&quot; is often more oriented to charity or socially oriented uses, based more on &quot;ability&quot; to pay, while &quot;pay what you want&quot; is often more broadly oriented to perceived value in combination with willingness and ability to pay.
;Value-added reseller model: Value Added Reseller is a model where a business makes something which is resold by other businesses but with modifications which add value to the original product or service. These modifications or additions are mostly industry specific in nature and are essential for the distribution. Businesses going for a VAR model have to develop a VAR network. It is one of the latest collaborative business models which can help in faster development cycles and is adopted by many Technology companies especially software.

Other examples of business models are:
* Auction business model
* All-in-one business model
* Chemical leasing
* Low-cost carrier business model
* Loyalty business models
* Monopolistic business model
* Multi-level marketing business model
* Network effects business model
* Online auction business model
* Online content business model
* Premium business model
* Professional open-source model
* Pyramid scheme business model
* Razor and blades model
* Servitization of products business model
* Subscription business model
* Network Orchestrators Companies
*Virtual business model

==Frameworks==

Technology centric communities have defined &quot;frameworks&quot; for business modeling. These frameworks attempt to define a rigorous approach to defining business value streams. It is not clear, however, to what extent such frameworks are actually important for business planning. Business model frameworks represent the core aspect of any company; they involve &quot;the totality of how a company selects its customers defines and differentiates its offerings, defines the tasks it will perform itself and those it will outsource, configures its resource, goes to market, creates utility for customers, and captures profits&quot;. A business framework involves internal factors (market analysis; products/services promotion; development of trust; social influence and knowledge sharing) and external factors (competitors and technological aspects).

* Business reference model
:Business reference model is a reference model, concentrating on the architectural aspects of the core business of an enterprise, service organization or government agency.
* Component business model
:Technique developed by IBM to model and analyze an enterprise. It is a logical representation or map of business components or &quot;building blocks&quot; and can be depicted on a single page. It can be used to analyze the alignment of enterprise strategy with the organization&#x27;s capabilities and investments, identify redundant or overlapping business capabilities, etc.
* Industrialization of services business model
:Business model used in strategic management and services marketing that treats service provision as an industrial process, subject to industrial optimization procedures
* Business Model Canvas
:Developed by A. Osterwalder, Yves Pigneur, Alan Smith, and 470 practitioners from 45 countries, the business model canvas is one of the most used frameworks for describing the elements of business models.

*OGSM
:The OGSM is developed by Marc van Eck and Ellen van Zanten of Business Openers into the &#x27;Business plan on 1 page&#x27;. Translated in several languages all over the world. #1 Management book in The Netherlands in 2015. The foundation of Business plan on 1 page is the OGSM. Objectives, Goals, Strategies and Measures (dashboard and actions).

== Related concepts ==
The process of business model design is part of business strategy. Business model design and innovation refer to the way a firm (or a network of firms) defines its business logic at the strategic level.

In contrast, firms implement their business model at the operational level, through their business operations. This refers to their process-level activities, capabilities, functions and infrastructure (for example, their business processes and business process modeling), their organizational structures (e.g. organograms, workflows, human resources) and systems (e.g. information technology architecture, production lines).

The brand is a consequence of the business model and has a symbiotic relationship with it, because the business model determines the brand promise, and the brand equity becomes a feature of the model. Managing this is a task of integrated marketing.

The standard terminology and examples of business models do not apply to most nonprofit organizations, since their sources of income are generally not the same as the beneficiaries. The term &#x27;funding model&#x27; is generally used instead.

The model is defined by the organization&#x27;s vision, mission, and values, as well as sets of boundaries for the organization—what products or services it will deliver, what customers or markets it will target, and what supply and delivery channels it will use. Mission and vision together make part of the overall business purpose. While the business model includes high-level strategies and tactical direction for how the organization will implement the model, it also includes the annual goals that set the specific steps the organization intends to undertake in the next year and the measures for their expected accomplishment. Each of these is likely to be part of internal documentation that is available to the internal auditor.

== Business model innovation ==

When an organisation creates a new business model, the process is called business model innovation. There is a range of reviews on the topic, The concept facilitates the analysis and planning of transformations from one business model to another. Frequent and successful business model innovation can increase an organisation&#x27;s resilience to changes in its environment and if an organisation has the capability to do this, it can become a competitive advantage. Although business model innovation promises financial returns, periods of radical business model innovation can reduce the person-organization fit and thus lead to a greater fluctuation in the workforce.

==Business Model Adaptation==
As a specific instance of Business Model Dynamics, a research strand derived from the evolving changes in business models, BMA identifies an update of the current business model to changes derived from the context. BMA can be innovative or not, depending on the degree of novelty of the changes implemented. As a consequence of the new context, several business model elements are promoted to answer those challenges, pivoting the business model towards new models. Companies adapt their business model when someone or something such as COVID-19 has disrupted the market. BMA could fit any organization, but incumbents are more motivated to adapt their current BM than to change it radically or create a new one.

Since their inception the Ducks&#x27; home ballpark has been Fairfield Properties Ballpark, formerly known as Bethpage Ballpark (2010-2020), Suffolk County Sports Park (1999 and 2010), EAB Park (2000–2001), and Citibank Park (2002–2009). The &quot;Ducks&quot; name refers to Long Island&#x27;s duck-farming heritage (itself represented by the Big Duck ferrocement) and recalls the former Long Island Ducks professional ice hockey team. The team&#x27;s first manager was Bud Harrelson, a part-owner of the team and a former major league player.

==History==
The Ducks, the only professional Minor League baseball team located on suburban Long Island, in New York State. east of New York City. They began play in 2000, and from 2000 to 2019 won four Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (ALPB ) championships. Team owner Frank Boulton expressed his contentment with the Ducks in 2007 to the publication &quot;Baseball America&quot;, saying, &quot;The Long Island Ducks are the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done in baseball.&quot;

A league rivalry developed between the Ducks and the Bridgeport Bluefish, of Bridgeport, Connecticut with the two teams contesting the &quot;Ferry Cup&quot; from 2009 until the latter team&#x27;s termination in 2017. The Ferry Cup name referred to its sponsor, the Bridgeport &amp; Port Jefferson Steamboat Company, (which ran a ferry boat line across the Long Island Sound, between Bridgeport, Connecticut to Port Jefferson on Long Island in New York State), which was frequently utilized by both of the teams and their fans for traveling to each ballpark in the two adjacent states.

Former Major League Baseball (MLB) player and MLB Hall of Fame member Gary Carter managed the Ducks in 2009. Following Carter&#x27;s death in 2012, the Ducks dedicated the season to his memory and wore a commemorative patch on their uniforms.

Former Major League Baseball players to have played on the Ducks include Dontrelle Willis, Ramon Castro, Ben Broussard, Leo Rosales, Josh Barfield, Bill Hall, Bryant Nelson, Ian Snell, Daniel Murphy, and Lew Ford. Rich Hill played with the Ducks in 2015, prior to his return to the majors in 2016 with the Boston Red Sox of the American League. In 2017, pitcher Éric Gagné attempted a professional baseball comeback with the Ducks; that same year, Nate Freiman, Henderson Alvarez, Quintin Berry, and Tim Melville played with the Ducks and later joined an MLB organization or foreign professional league.

On June 17, 2023, the Ducks became the winningest team in Atlantic League history, clinching their 1,581st win in a victory over the York Revolution of York, Pennsylvania.

==Logos and uniforms==

The official colors of the Long Island Ducks are black, green, orange, and white. The primary logo features the &quot;Ducks&quot; wordmark in orange with black outline. The wordmark begins with a stylized, cartoon duck head in the form of a capital cursive &quot;D.&quot;

Since 2015, OC Sports has been the official on-field headwear of the Atlantic League. The home caps are black with the duck head logo centered on the front. The away caps are black with an orange brim and the duck head logo. Batting helmets are black with the webbed-foot logo.

The Ducks wear uniforms produced by Rawlings. The home jersey is white with black pinstripes with the &quot;Ducks&quot; wordmark centered across the front. The numbering on the jersey is primarily in green with white outline and black drop shadow. The away jerseys are grey with the &quot;Long Island&quot; cursive wordmark centered across in green with white and orange outline. The numbering is in green with white outline and orange drop shadow. The alternate is an orange jersey with the &quot;Ducks&quot; word mark centered across the chest.

<doc id="65535" wikidata="Q4384901" url="?curid=65535" title="Aeron chair">
<text>The Aeron chair is an office chair manufactured and sold by American furniture company Herman Miller. Introduced in 1994, it was designed by Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf and has received numerous accolades for its industrial design. It is featured in the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s permanent collection. It has been cited as the best-selling individual office chair in the United States with over 8 million sold.

==Development==
Development of the Aeron chair began in the late 1970s, after Herman Miller hired designers Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf. They sought to design a chair that improved upon the shortcomings of La-Z-Boy recliners that were often used in residential and medical settings for the elderly, and completed a prototype called the Sarah Chair in 1988. Herman Miller cancelled the Sarah Chair after deeming it unlikely to be commercially viable, and tasked them with designing an office chair.

According to Chadwick, they were tasked by Herman Miller to update the company&#x27;s previous best-selling office chair, not to design the ideal chair for an eight-hour workday. He said, &quot;We were given a brief and basically told to design the next-generation office chair.&quot; They carried over some design concepts from the Sarah Chair, such as a semi-reclining mechanism that simultaneously moved the seat and chairback, to benefit professionals who worked long hours on computers. Early prototypes included foam and upholstery which were abandoned in favor of a fabric mesh called &quot;pellicle&quot; that they found would be more moldable to the user and more breathable, a concept carried over from the Sarah Chair to prevent bedsores. Herman Miller&#x27;s marketing department was initially apprehensive about selling a chair without upholstery, but the company approved the design. The Aeron chair was introduced in October 1994 and priced at $1,000. It was reportedly named after the Celtic god Aeron, as well as referring to aeration and aeronautics.
The suspended &quot;pellicle&quot; mesh seat and backrest are moulded into glass-fiber reinforced plastic frames. The Aeron chair is made out of recycled materials, and 94 percent of the chair itself is recyclable. It was available in three sizes, A (smallest), B and C (largest), and originally included a height-adjustable lumbar support pad. In 2002, an updated ergonomic support system called PostureFit was introduced to improve lower back support. In 2005, the arms switched from a dial to a lever to loosen for height adjustment. Variants produced include a wheelless version with a flat base named the Aeron Side Chair, and a higher version with a footrest named the Aeron Stool.

In 2016, Herman Miller released a redesigned version of the chair named the Aeron Remastered, later sold and marketed as simply Aeron. Chadwick contributed to the updated design, Stumpf having died in 2006. It includes an updated suspension system, better spine support, a redesigned denser mesh and a re-engineered tilt. Some components that were previously aluminum were switched to plastic. The original version of the chair was given the retronym &quot;Aeron Classic&quot;.

== Reception ==

According to &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, the Aeron chair &quot;made a fetish of lumbar support&quot;. Architect Galen Cranz said that while the company is aware that a perching position (facilitated by the chair&#x27;s rounded front rail) is preferable, it put in the lumbar support to conform to public expectations—&quot;because that&#x27;s what people think is required for it to be a scientifically &#x27;good&#x27; chair.&quot; Of the &quot;pellicle&quot; mesh she said, &quot;one of the secrets of the success of that chair was finding that fabric they called ‘pellicle’. That sheer but resistant fabric hit on the right gestalt for where our culture was at.&quot;

Sitting expert A. C. Mandal has criticized the Aeron for being &quot;far too low&quot; and not offering enough height adjustment and opportunities for the sitter to move.

The Aeron chair has been credited with revolutionizing the design of office chairs. According to architecture professor Witold Rybczynski, the Aeron was a &quot;rejection of the traditional corporate chair hierarchy,&quot; and led to a decline of larger, high-back executive chairs among executives. According to &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;Aerons were hailed as triumphs of industrial design and were a whole different beast from the overstuffed leather power chairs that dominated the Old Economy.&quot; &quot;Wired&quot; described the Aeron&#x27;s appearance as &quot;a chair that looked more engineered than designed.&quot;

In 1994, before the Aeron chair&#x27;s general release, Museum of Modern Art curator Paola Antonelli added it to the museum&#x27;s permanent collection. An Aeron chair is also displayed in the Brooklyn Museum.

==Sales and market==
The Aeron chair was a success and its sales far exceeded Herman Miller&#x27;s expectations. Aeron chairs were popular in the offices of Internet startups in the late 1990s, and became associated with the dot-com bubble. &quot;Wired&quot; noted, &quot;In Silicon Valley, especially, it quickly became a status symbol, visually synonymous with the optimism of the dot-com boom.&quot; A 2006 article in &quot;New York&quot; magazine called the Aeron &quot;the Dot-Com Throne&quot;, writing that the chairs &quot;became shorthand for the countless companies that didn&#x27;t have a clue how to make money on the Internet, but, man, did they have the know-how to set up a cool office&quot;. The Aeron was so popular that after the bubble burst, one commenter described the piles of unused chairs as reminiscent of a &quot;corporate graveyard&quot; of office furniture.

In 2010, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; stated that the Aeron was the best-selling individual office chair in the United States. As of 2023, Herman Miller had sold 8 million chairs, and more than a million chairs are produced every year.

<doc id="65536" wikidata="Q17020302" url="?curid=65536" title="Nashua Pride">
<text>The Nashua Pride was a professional baseball team based in Nashua, New Hampshire, in the United States, not affiliated with Major League Baseball. They played home games at Holman Stadium from 1998 through 2008, when they were sold and renamed the American Defenders of New Hampshire. In 2010 that team moved to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and became the Pittsfield Colonials. The franchise itself no longer exists, as the Colonials folded after the 2011 baseball season.

==History==

The Nashua Pride was one of the founding members of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball in 1998. The team name was based on the fact that &quot;Money&quot; magazine twice named Nashua the &quot;best place to live&quot; in the America. The team&#x27;s primary home uniform logo was the word &quot;Pride&quot; in script, and included the number &quot;1&quot; inside the capital &quot;P.&quot;

In the 2000 season, the team swept the Somerset Patriots in three games to win the Atlantic League Championship Series. However, the Patriots answered that loss by defeating the Pride in the 2003 and 2005 championships. Despite their on-field success, the Pride suffered as a result of having one of the lowest average attendances and being the farthest team from the core of the league.

In 2006, the team moved to the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball, (Can-Am League). As Nashua is closer in proximity to the teams of the Can-Am League than those of the Atlantic, the Pride was relieved of the expensive travel to away games.

In 2007, the Pride won the Can-Am League championship. After that season, long-time manager Butch Hobson left the Pride to take the managerial job with the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs of the Atlantic League, while former Boston Red Sox outfielder Rick Miller was hired as manager in Nashua. Former Boston Red Sox firstbaseman/outfielder Brian Daubach was hired as the hitting coach midway through the 2008 season.

American skier Bode Miller played one home game each year for the team in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Former Red Sox reliever Rich &quot;El Guapo&quot; Garces appeared in the Pride bullpen in 2007 and 2008.

==Sale of the Pride==
Following the 2008 season, when the Pride lost an estimated $500,000, former owner John Stabile sold the team to the American Defenders of New Hampshire, LLC. Stabile, a Nashua resident, had bought the team in January 2006 to prevent it from relocating, and got assurances from the new owners that they would keep the team in Nashua.

American Defenders of New Hampshire, LLC consisted of Nokona executives Buddy Lewis and Jerry O&#x27;Connor, former Boston Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, and Terry Allvord.

The new owners changed the club&#x27;s name from the Nashua Pride to the American Defenders of New Hampshire, placing less of an emphasis on the Nashua market. They kept General Manager Chris Hall and promoted Brian Daubach from Hitting Coach to Manager.

The team was evicted from Holman Stadium in Nashua midway through the 2009 season because of nonpayment of rent.

== Nashua baseball history==
The Pride was one of several professional teams to play in Nashua, and one of five to have played at Holman Stadium:
*1895: Nashua Rainmakers, New England Association

== World Famous Monkey Boy ==

During their inaugural season, Chris &quot;Monkey Boy&quot; Ames became the secondary mascot performer for the Nashua Pride. Originally intended to only be present for the first home stand, Monkey Boy became a crowd favorite and was made a permanent mascot for the remainder of the season. Monkey Boy remained with the team until Ames suffered a torn ACL in 2002. Known for his high-energy antics, comedic performances, and fan engagement, Ames portrayed Monkey Boy, a beloved character who entertained crowds at Holman Stadium throughout the team&#x27;s tenure. In 2011, Monkey Boy returned for a one night only playoff appearance with the team (Now Nashua Silver Knights) Ames was tackled by a member of the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sharks, injuring Ames and effectively ending his career with Nashua.

After becoming a cult favorite with baseball fans in Nashua, Barstool Sports produced a comedic documentary around the Monkey Boy character and Ames. Following the history, memories and eventual return of the mascot to Holman Stadium in 2022.

<text>The Newark Bears were an American independent league professional baseball team based in Newark, New Jersey. They were a member of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball and, later, the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball. The Bears played their home games at Bears &amp; Eagles Riverfront Stadium. The team folded after the 2013 season.

==History of Newark baseball==

Newark was the home of several former minor league baseball teams, from the formation of the Newark Indians in 1902 and the addition of the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League in 1936. A Federal League team, the Newark Peppers, also played in 1915.

The original Newark Bears were a team in the International League from 1926 to 1949. They played their home games at the former Ruppert Stadium in what is now known as the Ironbound section of Newark.

===The Bears of the Atlantic League===

The Newark Bears are named for the former Newark Bears team of the International League. The new team was formed in 1998 by former New York Yankees catcher Rick Cerone, a Newark native. However, the Bears played their &quot;home&quot; schedule at The Ballpark at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, Connecticut that season while awaiting the completion of their new home field. In addition, the Bears played several home games during the first half of the 1999 season at Skylands Park in Augusta. The Bears inaugurated their new park, Bears &amp; Eagles Riverfront Stadium, in Newark on July 16, 1999.

Over the years, the Bears attracted star talent to their club. Ozzie Canseco played for the Bears in 2000 and 2001, and his brother José Canseco was with the team for part of 2001 as well. Rickey Henderson played the first half of the 2003 season with the Bears and was named Most Valuable Player in the Atlantic League All-Star Game. He was subsequently signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers but was released at season&#x27;s end, and he returned to the Bears for 2004. Also in 2003, the late José Lima pitched for the Bears at the beginning of the season; after the Kansas City Royals signed him away from Newark, Lima won his first seven decisions for the Royals.

Other notable alumni included Edgardo Alfonzo, Billy Ashley, Armando Benítez, Wes Chamberlain, Carl Everett, Keith Foulke, Jay Gibbons, Brian Giles, Pete Incaviglia, Lance Johnson, Jacque Jones, Jim Leyritz, Ramiro Mendoza, Hensley Meulens, Jamie Navarro, Alonzo Powell, Scott Spiezio, Daryle Ward, Scott Williamson and Craig Worthington.

===Rescue from bankruptcy and possible demise===

The Newark Bears, under former owner Marc Berson, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 24, 2008. The team&#x27;s existence was almost compromised until the Bases Loaded Group, LLC purchased the team, guaranteeing a $1 million line of credit to the Atlantic League. The Bases Loaded Group consisted of executives from Philadelphia and New Jersey, some hailing from Newark. The primary leader of the group was Tom Cetnar, former General Manager of the Bears in 2001. He served as president and was a member of the ownership group.

===Move to the Can-Am League===

The Newark Bears joined the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball on October 6, 2010. The Bears were one of three teams to join the league for the 2011 season, with the traveling New York Federals and the expansion Rockland Boulders. Newark was originally to be one of three cities to represent New Jersey in the Can-Am League along with Little Falls, home of the New Jersey Jackals, and Augusta, home of the Sussex Skyhawks. The Skyhawks, however, elected to stop operating after the 2010 season.

In 2010, the Newark Bears were purchased by New Jersey radiologist Dr. Douglas Spiel and his partner, Danielle Dronet.

The Can-Am League announced on November 28, 2013, the Newark Bears would not operate in 2014, with the remaining four teams now a division in the American Association. An auction for the team&#x27;s assets was held on April 26, 2014.

==Logos and uniforms==
The Newark Bears went through three phases of logos and uniform colors. When the franchise began, it had a purple, black and white color scheme. In the mid-2000s, the team went to red, black, and white. When the club ceased operations, its colors were navy blue and white. The primary logo consisted of a stylized bear holding a baseball bat superimposed over a depiction of the Newark skyline over a baseball diamond. The &quot;Newark Bears&quot; wordmark was centered at the base of the logo and included white accents and a black outline.

The Bears&#x27; uniforms were traditional in design. The home cap was navy blue throughout with a white block &quot;N&quot; centered on the front. The home jerseys were white with traditional navy blue pinstripes. A navy blue, block &quot;N&quot; was prominently displayed on the left breast. The road jersey was gray with the cursive &quot;Newark&quot; wordmark in navy blue, centered diagonally across the front. Both home and away jersey sleeves sported the Bears&#x27; primary logo. The Bears wore navy blue belts and socks with all uniforms.

==Season-by-season records==

* 2 Atlantic League Championships (2002, 2007)

==Rivalries==

Shortly after the Newark Bears joined the Can-Am League, they announced a formal rivalry with the New Jersey Jackals. Since both teams played in Essex County, they established the County Executives&#x27; Cup to formalize this geographical contest. 

==Radio==

Bears games were aired on WSOU-FM 89.5 from 1999 to 2003, and again from 2007 to 2008. Previous announcers for the team include Seton Hall color commentator Dave Popkin, former WNEW-FM disc jockey Jim Monaghan, MLB Network host Victor Rojas, Somerset Patriots announcer Brian Bender, former New York Islanders broadcaster Jim Cerny, Jason Page, Ray Alexander, and Erie Otters broadcaster Paul Roper. In 2009, longtime New York sportscaster Spencer Ross served as both radio broadcaster and team on-field MC.

==Mascots==

The Newark Bears&#x27; official mascots were anthropomorphic bears named Ruppert and Effa. They wore the team&#x27;s home jersey and cap. Ruppert was named after Jacob Ruppert, who owned the former Newark Bears team in the 1930s. Effa alludes to Effa Manley, the first woman to own and operate a professional baseball team (the Newark Eagles) and the only female member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

<doc id="65538" wikidata="Q5040" url="?curid=65538" title="James Meredith">
<text>James Howard Meredith (born June 25, 1933) is an American civil rights activist, writer, political adviser, and United States Air Force veteran who became, in 1962, the first African-American student admitted to the racially segregated University of Mississippi after the intervention of the federal government (an event that was a flashpoint in the civil rights movement). Inspired by President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural address, Meredith decided to exercise his constitutional rights and apply to the University of Mississippi. His goal was to put pressure on the Kennedy administration to enforce civil rights for African Americans. The admission of Meredith ignited the Ole Miss riot of 1962 where Meredith&#x27;s life was threatened and 31,000 American servicemen were required to quell the violence – the largest ever invocation of the Insurrection Act of 1807.

In 1966, Meredith planned a solo March Against Fear from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi; he wanted to highlight continuing racism in the South and encourage voter registration after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He did not want major civil rights organizations involved. The second day, he was shot by a white gunman and suffered numerous wounds. Leaders of major organizations vowed to complete the march in his name after he was taken to the hospital. While Meredith was recovering, more people from across the country became involved as marchers. He rejoined the march and when Meredith and other leaders entered Jackson on June 26, they were leading an estimated 15,000 marchers, in what was the largest civil rights march in Mississippi. During the march, more than 4,000 African Americans registered to vote, and it was a catalyst to continued community organizing and additional registration.

In 2002 and again in 2012, the University of Mississippi led year-long series of events to celebrate the 40th and 50th anniversaries of Meredith&#x27;s integration of the institution. He was among numerous speakers invited to the campus, where a statue of him commemorates his role. The Lyceum-The Circle Historic District at the center of the campus has been designated as a National Historic Landmark for these events.

==Early life and education==
Meredith was born in 1933 in Kosciusko, Mississippi, the son of Roxie (Patterson) and Moses Meredith. He is of African-American, English Canadian, Scots and Choctaw heritage. His family nickname was &quot;J-Boy&quot;. European traders intermarried with some Choctaw during the colonial period. In the 1830s, thousands of Choctaw chose to stay in Mississippi and become United States citizens when most of the tribe left their traditional homeland for Indian Territory during the federally imposed removal. Those in the state had unions with European Americans and African Americans (some of whom were enslaved), adding to the multi-racial population in the developing territory.

Meredith completed 11th grade at Attala County Training School (which was segregated as &quot;white&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; under the state&#x27;s Jim Crow laws) and completed 12th grade at Gibbs High School in St. Petersburg, Florida. He graduated from high school in 1951. Then, Meredith enlisted in the United States Air Force. He served from 1951 to 1960.

Afterward Meredith attended Jackson State University for two years, achieving good grades.

==University of Mississippi==
=== Challenge to the University ===
In 1961, inspired the day before by U.S. President John F. Kennedy, Meredith started to apply to the University of Mississippi, intending to insist on his civil rights to attend the state-funded university. It still admitted only white students under the state&#x27;s culture of racial segregation, although the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, as they are supported by all the taxpayers.

Meredith wrote in his application that he wanted admission for his country, race, family, and himself. He said,

Nobody handpicked me...I believed, and believe now, that I have a Divine Responsibility... I am familiar with the probable difficulties involved in such a move as I am undertaking and I am fully prepared to pursue it all the way to a degree from the University of Mississippi.

He was twice denied admission. During this time, he was advised by Medgar Evers, who was head of the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

On May 31, 1961, Meredith, with backing of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, alleging that the university had rejected him only because of his race, as he had a highly successful record of military service and academic courses. The case went through many hearings, after which the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that Meredith had the right to be admitted to the state school. The state appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which supported the ruling of the appeals court.

On September 13, 1962, the District Court entered an injunction directing the members of the Board of Trustees and the officials of the University to register Meredith. The Democratic Governor of Mississippi, Ross Barnett, declared &quot;no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your governor&quot;. The state legislature quickly created a plan. They passed a law that denied admission to any person &quot;who has a crime of moral turpitude against him&quot; or who had been convicted of any felony offense or not pardoned. The same day it became law, Meredith was accused and convicted of &quot;false voter registration,&quot; in absentia, in Jackson County. The conviction against Meredith was trumped up: Meredith both owned land in northern Mississippi and was registered to vote in Jackson, where he lived. &quot;Later the clerk testified that Meredith was qualified to register and vote in Jackson [where he was registered].&quot;
On September 20, the federal government obtained an injunction against enforcement of this Act and of the two state court decrees that had barred Meredith&#x27;s registration. That day Meredith was rebuffed again by Governor Barnett in his efforts to gain admission, though university officials were prepared to admit him. On September 25, Meredith attempted to register again, but Governor Barnett blocked Meredith’s entry to the College Board office. On September 28, the Court of Appeals, &quot;en banc&quot; and after a hearing, found the Governor in civil contempt and ordered that he be arrested and pay a fine of $10,000 for each day that he kept up the refusal, unless he complied by October 2. On September 29, Lieutenant Governor Paul B. Johnson Jr. (elected Governor on November 5, 1963) was also found in contempt by a panel of the court, and a similar order was entered against him, with a fine of $5,000 a day.

Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy had a series of phone calls with Governor Barnett between September 27 to October 1. Barnett reluctantly agreed to let Meredith enroll in the university, but secretly bargained with Kennedy on a plan which would allow him to save face.

Barnett committed to maintain civil order. Robert Kennedy ordered 127 U.S. Marshals as well as 316 deputized U.S. Border Patrol and 97 Federal Bureau of Prisons officers to accompany Meredith during his arrival and registration. On September 29, President Kennedy issued a proclamation commanding all persons engaged in the obstruction of the laws and the orders of the courts to &quot;cease and desist therefrom and to disperse and retire peaceably forthwith&quot;, citing his authority under , , and to use the militia or the armed forces to suppress any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy.

===Rioting at the University===
On September 29, Governor Barnett made a spirited speech at halftime of the Ole Miss-Kentucky football game, firing up the crowd and encouraging people to block Meredith’s entry to the university. He said, in part, &quot;I love Mississippi! I love her people, our customs ... I love and I respect our heritage.&quot; The Ole Miss Band waved a large Confederate flag, and the stands were full of students waving Confederate flags. President Kennedy sent federal marshals to Mississippi.

On Sunday, September 30, 1962, Governor Barnett called the Attorney General, Robert Kennedy, to try to get him to postpone Meredith’s admission to the University. The Attorney General refused. Meredith, accompanied by Mississippi Highway Patrol and 500 federal marshals, moved into his dorm room. Outside the Lyceum building, where Meredith was due to register for classes the next day, a crowd of hostile students formed near the marshals who were protecting the building. At 7:30 p.m., the crowd broke into a riot. The crowd, which numbered 3000, threw bottles and rocks, and the marshals tear-gassed them. More than 300 people were injured, and two people were killed.

=== Enrollment ===
The day after the riots, on October 1, 1962, after federal and state forces took control, Meredith became the first African-American student to enroll at the University of Mississippi. Meredith&#x27;s admission is regarded as a pivotal moment in the history of civil rights in the United States.

Many students harassed Meredith during his two semesters on campus, but others accepted him. According to first-person accounts, students living in Meredith&#x27;s dorm bounced basketballs on the floor just above his room through all hours of the night. Other students ostracized him: when Meredith walked into the cafeteria for meals, the students eating would turn their backs. If Meredith sat at a table with other students, all of whom were white, the students would immediately get up and go to another table. He persisted through harassment and extreme isolation to graduate on August 18, 1963, with a degree in political science.

==Education and activism==
Meredith continued his education, focusing on political science, at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. He returned to the United States in 1965. He attended law school through a scholarship at Columbia University and earned an LL.B (law degree) in 1968

In 1966, Meredith organized and led a solo, personal March Against Fear for 220 miles from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi, beginning on June 6, 1966. Inviting only black men to join him, he wanted to highlight continuing racial oppression in the Mississippi Delta, as well as to encourage blacks to register and vote following passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, which authorized federal oversight and enforcement of rights. Governor Paul Johnson promised to allow the march and provide State Highway Police protection. Meredith wanted blacks in Mississippi to overcome fear of violence.

Despite a police presence, on the second day, Meredith was shot and wounded by Aubrey James Norvell, a white man whose motives were never determined, and who pleaded guilty at trial. Meredith was quickly taken to a hospital. Leaders of major organizations rallied at the news and vowed to complete the march in Meredith&#x27;s name. They struggled to reconcile differing goals, but succeeded in attracting more than 10,000 marchers from local towns and across the country by the end.

Norvell pleaded guilty to battery and assault with intent to kill and was sentenced to five years in prison.

Meredith suffered from superficial wounds to his neck, legs, head, and right side. He recovered from his wounds, and rejoined the march before it reached Jackson on June 26, when 15,000 marchers entered the city in what had become the largest civil rights march in state history. During the march, more than 4,000 black Mississippians registered to vote. Continued community organizing was catalyzed by these events, and African Americans began to enter the political system again.

==Political career==
In 1967, while living and studying in New York, Meredith decided to run as a Republican against incumbent Adam Clayton Powell Jr., a multi-term Democrat, in a special election for the Congressional seat in Harlem. He withdrew from the race and Powell was re-elected. Meredith said later of his campaign, &quot;The Republican Party [of New York] made me an offer: full support in every way, everything.&quot; He had full access to top New York Republicans.

After returning to Mississippi in 1972, Meredith entered the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat of Democrat James Eastland, who had been the incumbent for 29 years in what had operated as a one-party state. Following provisions of a new state constitution in 1890 that made voter registration extremely difficult, African Americans had been effectively disenfranchised and the Republican Party had been crippled. Meredith conceded that he had little chance of winning unless Governor George Wallace of Alabama entered the presidential race and split the white vote. As it happened, many Republicans in Mississippi were not enthusiastic about the prospect of Meredith as their nominee, and Gil Carmichael, a businessman from Meridian, was recruited to run against him. Meredith received only 21% of the primary vote against Carmichael.

An active Republican, Meredith served from 1989 to 1991 as a domestic adviser on the staff of United States Senator Jesse Helms. Faced with criticism from the civil rights community for working for the avowed segregationist, Meredith said that he had applied to every member of the Senate and House offering his services, and only Helms&#x27; office responded. He also wanted a chance to do research at the Library of Congress.

In 2002, officials at the University of Mississippi celebrated the 40th anniversary of Meredith&#x27;s historic admission and integration of the institution with a year-long series of events. Of the celebration, Meredith said,

It was an embarrassment for me to be there, and for somebody to celebrate it, oh my God. I want to go down in history, and have a bunch of things named after me, but believe me that ain&#x27;t it.

He said he had achieved his main goal at the time by getting the federal government to enforce his rights as a citizen. He saw his actions as &quot;an assault on white supremacy&quot;. In 2003, he was far more proud that his son Joseph Meredith graduated as the top doctoral student at the university&#x27;s graduate business school.

==Legacy and honors==
*In 2002, the University of Mississippi honored the 40th anniversary of Meredith&#x27;s admission with numerous events.
*In 2006, a statue of him was dedicated on campus in his honor.
*In 2012, the University commemorated the 50th anniversary of the historic admission, featuring a range of speakers, artists, lectures and events during the year.
*That year Meredith received the Harvard Graduate School of Education &#x27;Medal for Education Impact&#x27; and was the school&#x27;s convocation speaker. Meredith said it was the first award in 50 years he had accepted.

==Cultural depictions==
In 2011 miniseries &quot;The Kennedys&quot;, Meredith was portrayed by Matthew G. Brown in episode five of the series, &quot;Life Sentences&quot;.

==Political viewpoint==
A highly independent man, Meredith has identified as an individual American citizen who demanded and received the constitutional rights held by any American, not as a participant in the Civil Rights Movement. There have been tensions between him and leaders of major organizations of the movement. When interviewed in 2002, the 40th anniversary of his enrollment at University of Mississippi, Meredith said, &quot;Nothing could be more insulting to me than the concept of civil rights. It means perpetual second-class citizenship for me and my kind.&quot;

Meredith was a supporter of the unsuccessful 1967 gubernatorial bid of ex-Mississippi Governor (and avowed segregationist) Ross Barnett, who had been responsible for Meredith&#x27;s not being allowed at the University of Mississippi, as well as the 1991 gubernatorial campaign of Louisiana State Representative and ex-Klansman David Duke. On these endorsements, Meredith wrote “I prefer bigotry to be out in the open where I can confront it.&quot; 

In a 2002 interview with CNN, Meredith said of his efforts to integrate Ole Miss, &quot;I was engaged in a war. I considered myself engaged in a war from Day One. And my objective was to force the federal government—the Kennedy administration at that time—into a position where they would have to use the United States military force to enforce my rights as a citizen.&quot;

==Personal life==
On March 14, 1956, Meredith married Mary June Wiggins. She later worked as a high school English teacher. They had three sons, James, John and Joseph Howard Meredith. Mary June Meredith died of heart failure in December 1979.

In 1982, Meredith married Judy Alsobrooks in Gary, Indiana. She had one son, Kip Naylor, from a previous marriage. Jessica Howard Meredith was born to the couple. The couple live in Jackson, Mississippi.

<text>The Somerset Patriots are an American professional Minor League Baseball (MiLB) team based in Bridgewater, New Jersey. They are the Double-A affiliate of the New York Yankees. They compete in the Eastern League (EL), known as the Double-A Northeast in 2021, and were previously members of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (ALPB) from 1998 to 2020. The Patriots have played their home games at TD Bank Ballpark since 1999.

From 1998 to 2020, the Patriots were the most successful franchise in the Atlantic League. During their twenty-two seasons, they compiled 1,580 regular seasons wins, 47 playoff wins, captured thirteen division titles and six league championship titles in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2009, and 2015, all league records. Their most recent Atlantic League playoff appearance was in 2018 when they lost in the semifinals against the Long Island Ducks.

Their success continued with the move to the Eastern League in 2021 winning back-to-back division titles in 2021 and 2022 and the 2022 Eastern League Championship.They won the first-half season division title in 2023 and the second-half season division title in 2024.

The &quot;Patriots&quot; name refers to the Middlebrook encampment where the first official flag of the United States was unfurled, after a law to adopt a national flag had been passed by Congress on June 14, 1777. By special order of Congress, a 13-star flag is flown 24 hours a day at the Washington Camp Ground, part of the former Middlebrook encampment, in Bridgewater Township.

==History==

The Somerset Patriots were one of the founding members of the Atlantic League in 1998. However, the team spent its inaugural season as a road team while TD Bank Park was being constructed. In the 1999 season, the Patriots opened their ballpark, where they quickly became one of the most successful franchises of the league in both the win and attendance columns.

For spring training in 2009, the Somerset Patriots became the first Atlantic League team to hold its spring training in its own locale, at the Jack Cust Baseball Academy in nearby Flemington, instead of the traditional site in Lakeland, Florida. The Lancaster Barnstormers and the York Revolution followed suit in 2009, primarily because of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession.

The Patriots, and then manager Sparky Lyle, won their 1,000th game on July 24, 2012. The Patriots defeated the Sugar Land Skeeters with a score of 6–5, in the day game of a day/night doubleheader.

On November 27, 2012, it was announced Somerset&#x27;s pitching coach and former major league pitcher, Brett Jodie, would become the new manager with Lyle becoming manager emeritus.

Former professional football player Donald Jones briefly played for the Patriots during his recovery from a kidney transplant.

With the Atlantic League&#x27;s 2020 season cancelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, Somerset organized a twelve game series called the SOMERSET Professional Baseball Series, which would feature the Patriots and the New Jersey Blasters, a team created for the series. The rosters were composed mostly of players from the state of New Jersey.

In November 2020, the Patriots were announced as the new Double-A affiliate of the New York Yankees, replacing the Trenton Thunder. They were organized into the Double-A Northeast. Somerset began competition in the new league as a Yankees affiliate on May 4 with a 6–0 victory over the Harrisburg Senators at TD Bank Ballpark. They won the 2021 Northeast Division title with a first-place 72–47 record. Despite winning the division, their record was third-best in the league, and only the two teams with the highest winning percentages in the regular season competed for the league championship. Oswaldo Cabrera won the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Award. In 2022, the Double-A Northeast became known as the Eastern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

On September 28, 2022, the Patriots won their first Eastern League Championship and seventh league championship overall with a 15–0 combined no-hitter victory over the Erie SeaWolves at TD Bank Ballpark.

==Season-by-season results==


==Logos and uniforms==

The Somerset Patriots&#x27; official colors are navy blue, maroon, and silver. The primary logo depicts a Continental soldier in navy blue with white stars on his shoulder and maroon stripes flowing to his left, a reference to the U.S. flag. Centered below the soldier is the wordmark in navy blue underlined by a silver baseball bat outlined in navy blue. The word &quot;Somerset&quot; is centered above the wordmark in maroon.

The Patriots wear caps and uniforms produced by New Era. The caps are navy blue throughout with the cap logo centered on the front. The cap logo consists of the Continental soldier&#x27;s head outlined in white and maroon. The Patriots also have an alternate cap that has a navy blue crown with a maroon brim and button. The cap logo on the alternate cap consists of a scripted &quot;S&quot; in maroon with a white outline and the Patriot-head cap logo superimposed. The home jersey includes pinstripes and the &quot;Patriots&quot; wordmark centered across the front in navy blue and maroon. The away jersey resembles the New York Yankees&#x27; away jersey with the &quot;Somerset&quot; wordmark. The belt, socks, and undershirt are navy blue.

The Patriots&#x27; alternate jersey is navy blue. The &quot;Patriots&quot; wordmark is centered on the chest in maroon with a white outline, and a white star in the underscore.

The Patriots have also played as the Jersey Diners for a couple of games during the 2024 season.

==Radio and television==

All of the Patriots&#x27; games are broadcast on Fox Sports New Jersey, as well as MiLB.TV with the voice of the Patriots, Steven Cusumano.

==Mascots==
One of the Somerset Patriots&#x27; official mascots is an anthropomorphic dog named Sparkee. He wears the team&#x27;s home uniform with white sneakers. The mascot debuted on July 11, 1998, at the Atlantic League&#x27;s first All-Star Game at Bernie Robbins Stadium in Atlantic City. Sparkee&#x27;s name refers to the Patriots&#x27; first manager, Sparky Lyle. The team also employs another character, a cat (according to Somerset Patriots staff (sometimes mistaken for a bear)) named Slider. After training with Sparkee for several months, he debuted in the 2007 season. Slider wears the Patriots&#x27; navy blue alternate jersey with gray pants. The team had a mascot named &quot;TD&quot; (after the stadium&#x27;s sponsor) debuted in the June 30, 2010, game against the Camden Riversharks. Also, the team had a live mascot known as &quot;General Admission&quot; who wore the traditional uniform donned by those fighting for the colonies during the American Revolution complete with the three-cornered hat and musket.

<text>The University of Mississippi (byname Ole Miss) is a public research university in University, Mississippi, near Oxford, Mississippi, United States, with a medical center in Jackson. It is Mississippi&#x27;s oldest public university and is the state&#x27;s largest by enrollment.

The Mississippi Legislature chartered the university on February 24, 1844, and in 1848 admitted its first 80 students. During the Civil War, the university operated as a Confederate hospital and narrowly avoided destruction by Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s forces. In 1962, during the civil rights movement, a race riot occurred on campus when segregationists tried to prevent the enrollment of African American student James Meredith. The university has since taken measures to improve its image. The university is closely associated with writer William Faulkner and owns and manages his former Oxford home Rowan Oak, which with other on-campus sites Barnard Observatory and Lyceum–The Circle Historic District, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Ole Miss is classified as &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. It is one of 33 institutions participating in the National Sea Grant Program and also participates in the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program. Its research efforts include the National Center for Physics Acoustics, the National Center for Natural Products Research, and the Mississippi Center for Supercomputing Research. The university operates the country&#x27;s only federally contracted Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved cannabis facility. It also operates interdisciplinary institutes such as the Center for the Study of Southern Culture. Its athletic teams compete as the Ole Miss Rebels in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s (NCAA) Division I Southeastern Conference.

The university&#x27;s alumni, faculty, and affiliates include 27 Rhodes Scholars, 10 governors, 5 US senators, a head of government, and a Nobel Prize Laureate. Other alumni have received accolades in the arts such as Emmy Awards, Grammy Awards, and Pulitzer Prizes. Its medical center performed the first human lung transplant and animal-to-human heart transplant.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
The Mississippi Legislature chartered the University of Mississippi on February 24, 1844. Planners selected an isolated, rural site in Oxford as a &quot;sylvan exile&quot; that would foster academic studies and focus. In 1845, residents of Lafayette County donated land west of Oxford for the campus and the following year, architect William Nichols oversaw construction of an academic building called the Lyceum, two dormitories, and faculty residences. On November 6, 1848, the university, offering a classical curriculum, opened to its first class of 80 students, most of whom were children of elite slaveholders, all of whom were white, and all but one of whom were from Mississippi. For 23 years, the university was Mississippi&#x27;s only public institution of higher learning and for 110 years, its only comprehensive university. In 1854, the University of Mississippi School of Law was established, becoming the fourth state-supported law school in the United States.

Early president Frederick A. P. Barnard sought to increase the stature of the university, placing him in conflict with the more conservative board of trustees. His hundred-page 1858 report to the trustees on his proposals resulted in little besides the university head&#x27;s title being changed to &quot;chancellor&quot;. Barnard&#x27;s northern background—he was born in Massachusetts and graduated from Yale—and Union sympathies resulted in heightened tensions: a student assaulted his slave and the state legislature investigated him. Following the presidential election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Mississippi became the second state to secede, with the articles of secession drafted by the university&#x27;s mathematics professor Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar. Students organized themselves into a military company called the &quot;University Greys&quot;, which merged with the Confederate States Army. Within a month of the Civil War&#x27;s outbreak, only 5 students remained at the University of Mississippi, and, by fall 1861, the university closed. In its final action, the board of trustees awarded Barnard a doctorate of divinity.

Within six months, Confederates converted the campus into a hospital. It was evacuated in November 1862 as General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Union forces approached. Although Kansan troops destroyed much of the medical equipment, a lone remaining professor persuaded Grant against burning the campus. After three weeks, Grant and his forces left, and the campus returned to being a Confederate hospital. Throughout the war, over 700 wounded died and were buried on campus.

===Post-Civil War===
The University of Mississippi reopened in October 1865. To avoid rejecting veterans, the university lowered admission standards and decreased costs by eliminating tuition and allowing students to live off-campus. The student body remained entirely white: in 1870 the chancellor declared that he and the entire faculty would resign rather than admit &quot;negro&quot; students. In 1882, the university began admitting women but they were not permitted to live on campus or attend law school. In 1885, the University of Mississippi hired Sarah McGehee Isom, becoming the first southeastern US college to hire a female faculty member. Nearly 100 years later, in 1981, the Sarah Isom Center for Women and Gender Studies was established in her honor.

The university&#x27;s byname &quot;Ole Miss&quot; was first used in 1897, when it won a contest of suggestions for a yearbook title. The term originated as a title domestic slaves used to distinguish the mistress of a plantation from &quot;young misses&quot;. Fringe origin theories include it coming from a diminutive of &quot;Old Mississippi&quot;, or from the name of the &quot;Ole Miss&quot; train that ran from Memphis to New Orleans. Within two years, students and alumni were using &quot;Ole Miss&quot; to refer to the university.

Between 1900 and 1930, the Mississippi Legislature introduced bills aiming to relocate, close, or merge the university with Mississippi State University. All such legislation failed. During the 1930s, the governor of Mississippi Theodore G. Bilbo was politically hostile toward the University of Mississippi, firing administrators and faculty, and replacing them with his friends in the &quot;Bilbo purge&quot;. Bilbo&#x27;s actions severely damaged the university&#x27;s reputation, leading to the temporary loss of its accreditation. Consequently, in 1944, the Constitution of Mississippi was amended to protect the university&#x27;s board of trustees from political pressure. During World War II, the University of Mississippi was one of 131 colleges and universities that participated in the national V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

===Integration===

In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Eight years after the &quot;Brown&quot; decision, all attempts by African American applicants to enroll at the University of Mississippi had failed. Shortly after the 1961 inauguration of President John F. Kennedy, James Meredith—an African American Air Force veteran and former student at Jackson State University—applied to the University of Mississippi. After months of obstruction by Mississippi officials, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered Meredith&#x27;s enrollment, and the Department of Justice under Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy entered the case on Meredith&#x27;s behalf. On three occasions, either governor Ross R. Barnett or lieutenant governor Paul B. Johnson Jr. physically blocked Meredith&#x27;s entry to the campus.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held both Barnett and Johnson Jr. in contempt, and issued fines exceeding $10,000 for each day they refused to enroll Meredith. On September 30, 1962, President Kennedy dispatched 127 U.S. Marshals, 316 deputized U.S. Border Patrol agents, and 97 federalized Federal Bureau of Prisons personnel to escort Meredith. After nightfall, far-right former Major General Edwin Walker and outside agitators arrived, and a gathering of segregationist students before the Lyceum became a violent mob. Segregationist rioters threw Molotov cocktails and bottles of acid, and fired guns at federal marshals and reporters. 160 marshals would be injured, with 28 receiving gunshot wounds, and two civilians—French journalist Paul Guihard and Oxford repairman Ray Gunter—were killed by gunfire. Eventually, 13,000 soldiers arrived in Oxford and quashed the riot. One-third of the federal officers—166 men—were injured, as were 40 federal soldiers and National Guardsmen. More than 30,000 personnel were deployed, alerted, and committed in Oxford—the most in American history for a single disturbance. Meredith enrolled and attended a class on October 1. By 1968, Ole Miss had around 100 African American students, and by the 2019–2020 academic year, African Americans constituted 12.5 percent of the student body.

===Recent history===
In 1972, Ole Miss purchased Rowan Oak, the former home of Nobel Prize–winning writer William Faulkner. The building has been preserved as it was at Faulkner&#x27;s death in 1962. Faulkner was the university&#x27;s postmaster in the early 1920s and wrote &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; (1930) at the university powerhouse. His Nobel Prize medallion is displayed in the university library. The university hosted the inaugural Faulkner and Yoknapatawpha Conference in 1974. In 1980, Willie Morris became the university&#x27;s first writer in residence.

In 2002, Ole Miss marked the 40th anniversary of integration with a yearlong series of events, including an oral history of the university, symposiums, a memorial, and a reunion of federal marshals who served at the campus. In 2006, the 44th anniversary of integration, a statue of Meredith was dedicated on campus. Two years later, the site of the 1962 riots was designated as a National Historic Landmark. The university also held a yearlong program to mark the 50th anniversary of integration in 2012. The university hosted the first presidential debate of 2008—the first presidential debate held in Mississippi—between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama.

Ole Miss retired its mascot Colonel Reb in 2003, citing its Confederate imagery. Although a grass-roots movement to adopt &quot;Star Wars&quot; character Admiral Ackbar of the Rebel Alliance gained significant support, Rebel Black Bear, a reference to Faulkner&#x27;s short story &quot;The Bear&quot;, was selected in 2010. The Bear was replaced with another mascot, Tony the Landshark, in 2017. Beginning in 2022, football coach Lane Kiffin&#x27;s dog Juice became the de facto mascot. In 2015, the university removed the Mississippi State Flag, which included the Confederate battle emblem, and in 2020, it relocated a prominent Confederate monument.

==Campus==

===Oxford campus===
The University of Mississippi&#x27;s Oxford campus is partially located in Oxford and partially in University, Mississippi, a census-designated place. The main campus is situated at an altitude of around , and has expanded from of land to around . The campus&#x27; buildings are largely designed in a Georgian architectural style; some of the newer buildings have a more contemporary architecture.

At the campus&#x27; center is &quot;The Circle&quot;, which consists of eight academic buildings organized around an ovaloid common. The buildings include the Lyceum (1848), the &quot;Y&quot; Building (1853), and six later buildings constructed in a Neoclassical Revival style. The Lyceum was the first building on the campus and was expanded with two wings in 1903. According to the university, the Lyceum&#x27;s bell is the oldest academic bell in the United States. Near the Circle is The Grove, a plot of land that was set aside by chancellor Robert Burwell Fulton , and hosts up to 100,000 tailgaters during home games. Barnard Observatory, which was constructed under Chancellor Barnard in 1859, was designed to house the world&#x27;s largest telescope. Due to the Civil War&#x27;s outbreak, however, the telescope was never delivered and was instead acquired by Northwestern University. The observatory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The first major building built after the Civil War was Ventress Hall, which was constructed in a Victorian Romanesque style in 1889.

From 1929 to 1930, architect Frank P. Gates designed 18 buildings on campus, mostly in Georgian Revival architectural style, including (Old) University High School, Barr Hall, Bondurant Hall, Farley Hall (also known as Lamar Hall), Faulkner Hall, and Wesley Knight Field House. During the 1930s, the many building projects at the campus were largely funded by the Public Works Administration and other federal entities. Among the notable buildings built in this period is the dual-domed Kennon Observatory (1939).
Two large modern buildings—the Ole Miss Union (1976) and Lamar Hall (1977)—caused controversy by diverging from the university&#x27;s traditional architecture. In 1998, the Gertrude C. Ford Foundation donated $20 million to establish the Gertrude C. Ford Center for the Performing Arts, which was the first building on campus to be solely dedicated to the performing arts. As of 2020, the university was constructing a STEM facility, the largest single construction project in the campus&#x27; history. The university owns and operates the University of Mississippi Museum, which comprises collections of American fine art, Classical antiquities, and Southern folk art, as well as historic properties in Oxford. Ole Miss also owns University-Oxford Airport, which is located north of the main campus.

North Mississippi Japanese Supplementary School, a Japanese weekend school, is operated in conjunction with Ole Miss, with classes held on campus. It opened in 2008 and was jointly established by several Japanese companies and the university. Many children have parents who are employees at Toyota facilities in Blue Springs.

===Satellite campuses===
In 1903, the University of Mississippi School of Medicine was established on the Oxford campus. It offered only two years of medical courses; students had to attend an out-of-state medical school to complete their degrees. This form of medical education continued until 1955, when the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) was established on a site in Jackson, Mississippi, and the School of Medicine was relocated there. A nursing school was established in 1956 and since then, other health-related schools have been added. , UMMC offers medical and graduate degrees. In addition to the medical center, the university has satellite campuses in Booneville, DeSoto, Grenada, Rankin, and Tupelo.

==Organization and administration==
===Divisions of the university===
The University of Mississippi consists of 15 schools. The largest undergraduate school is the College of Liberal Arts. Graduate schools include a law school, a school of business administration, an engineering school, and a medical school.

===Administration===
The University of Mississippi&#x27;s chief administrative officer is the chancellor, a position Glenn Boyce has held since 2019. The chancellor is supported by vice-chancellors who administer areas such as research and intercollegiate athletics. The provost oversees the university&#x27;s academic affairs, and a dean oversees each school, as well as general studies and the honors college. A faculty senate advises the administration.

The board of trustees of the Mississippi State Institutions of Higher Learning is the constitutional governing body that is responsible for policy and financial oversight of the University of Mississippi and the state&#x27;s other seven public secondary institutions. the board consists of 12 members, who serve staggered nine-year terms and represent the state&#x27;s three Supreme Court Districts. The board appoints the commissioner of higher education, who administers its policies.

===Finances===
, the University of Mississippi&#x27;s endowment was $775 million. The university&#x27;s budget for fiscal year 2019 was over $540 million. Less than 13% of operating revenues are funded by the state of Mississippi, and the university relies heavily on private donations. The Ford Foundation has donated nearly $65 million to the Oxford campus and UMMC.

==Academics==
The University of Mississippi is the state&#x27;s largest university by enrollment and is considered the state&#x27;s flagship university. In 2015, the student-faculty ratio was 19:1. Of its classes, 47.4 percent have fewer than 20 students. The most popular subjects include marketing, education and teaching, accountancy, finance, pharmaceutical sciences, and administration. To receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree, students must have at least 120 semester hours with passing grades and a cumulative 2.0 GPA.

The university also offers graduate degrees such as PhDs and masters of art, science, and fine arts. The university maintains the Mississippi Teacher Corps, a free graduate program that educates teachers for critical-needs public schools.

Taylor Medals, which were first awarded in 1905, are presented to exceptional students nominated by the faculty. The medals are named in honor of Marcus Elvis Taylor, who graduated in 1871 and are given to less than one percent of each class.

===Research===
Ole Miss is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. According to the National Science Foundation, the university spent $137 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 142nd in the nation. It is one of the 33 colleges and universities participating in the National Sea Grant Program and participates in the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program. Since 1948, the university has been a member of the Oak Ridge Associated Universities.

In 1963, University of Mississippi Medical Center surgeons, led by James Hardy, performed the world&#x27;s first human lung transplant, and in 1964 the world&#x27;s first animal-to-human heart transplant. Because Hardy researched transplantation, consisting of primate studies during the previous nine years, the heart of a chimpanzee was used for the transplant.

In 1965, the university established its Medicinal Plant Garden, which the School of Pharmacy uses for drug research. Since 1968, the school has operated the only legal marijuana farm and production facility in the United States. The National Institute on Drug Abuse contracts to the university production of cannabis for use in approved research studies and for distribution to the seven surviving medical marijuana patients grandfathered into the Compassionate Investigational New Drug program. The facility is the only source of marijuana medical researchers can use to conduct Food and Drug Administration-approved tests.

The National Center for Physics Acoustics (NCPA), which Congress established in 1986, is located on campus. In addition to conducting research, the NCPA houses the Acoustical Society of America&#x27;s archives. The university also operates the University of Mississippi Field Station, which includes 223 research ponds and supports long-term ecological research, and hosts the Mississippi Center for Supercomputing Research and the Mississippi Law Research Institute. In 2012, the university completed Insight Park, a research park that &quot;welcomes companies commercializing University of Mississippi research&quot;.

===Special programs===
Honors education at the University of Mississippi, consisting of lectures by distinguished academics, began in 1953. In 1974, this program became the University Scholars Program, and in 1983, the University Honors Program was created and honors-core courses were offered. In 1997, Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale and wife Sally donated $5.4 million to establish the Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College (SMBHC), which provides a capstone project—a senior thesis—and endowed scholarships.

In 1977, the university established its Center for the Study of Southern Culture with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, which is housed in the College of Liberal Arts. The center provides for interdisciplinary studies of Southern history and culture. In 2000, the university established the Trent Lott Leadership Institute, which is named after alumnus and then-US Senate majority leader Trent Lott. The institute was funded with large corporate donations from MCI Inc., Lockheed Martin, and other companies. In addition to leadership initiatives, the institute offers a BA degree in Public Policy Leadership.

The Center for Intelligence and Security Studies (CISS) delivers academic programming on intelligence analysis and engages in applied research and consortium building with government, private, and academic partners. In 2012, the United States Director of National Intelligence designated CISS as an Intelligence Community Center of Academic Excellence (CAE), becoming one of 29 such college programs in the United States. Other special programs include the Haley Barbour Center for Manufacturing Excellence—established jointly by the university and Toyota in 2008—and the Chinese Language Flagship Program (). The Croft Institute for International Studies, which was founded in 1998, provides the only international studies undergraduate program in Mississippi.

The University of Mississippi is a member of the SEC Academic Consortium, which has since been renamed SECU. The collaborative initiative was designed to promote research, scholarship, and achievement among the member universities in the Southeastern Conference. In 2013, the university participated in the SEC Symposium on renewable energy in Atlanta, Georgia, which was organized and led by the University of Georgia and the UGA Bioenergy Systems Research Institute.

In 2021, actor Morgan Freeman and Professor Linda Keena donated $1 million to the University of Mississippi to create the Center for Evidence-Based Policing and Reform, which will provide law-enforcement training and seek to improve engagement between law enforcement and communities.

===Rankings and accolades===
In &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s 2023 rankings, the University of Mississippi was tied for 163rd place among national universities and 88th among public universities. In 2023, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; ranked the professional MBA program at the School of Business Administration #72 nationally, and the online MBA program in the top 25. , all three degree programs at the Patterson School of Accountancy were among the top 10 accounting programs according to the &quot;Public Accounting Report&quot;.

Since 2012, the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; has named the University of Mississippi as one of the &quot;Great Colleges to Work For&quot;. In the 2018 results, released in the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s annual report on &quot;The Academic Workplace&quot;, the university was among 84 institutions honored from the 253 colleges and universities surveyed. In 2018, the university&#x27;s campus was ranked the second-safest in the SEC and one of the safest in the U.S.

As of 2019, the university has had 27 Rhodes Scholars. Since 1998, it has 10 Goldwater Scholars, seven Truman Scholars, 18 Fulbright Scholars, one Marshall Scholar, three Udall Scholars, two Gates Cambridge Scholars, one Mitchell Scholar, 19 Boren Scholars, one Boren fellow, and one German Chancellor Fellowship.

==Student life==
===Student body===
As of the 2023–2024 academic year, the student body consists of 18,533 undergraduates and 2,264 in graduate programs. Around 57 percent of the undergraduate student body were female. As of Fall 2023, minorities composed 23.5 percent of the body. The median family income of students is $116,600, and over half of students come from the top 20 percent. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the University of Mississippi has the seventh-highest share of students from the economic top-one percent among selective public schools. The median starting salary of a graduate is $47,700, according to &quot;US News&quot;.

Although 54 percent of undergraduates are from Mississippi, the student body is geographically diverse. As of late 2020, the university&#x27;s undergraduates represented all 82 counties in Mississippi, 49 states, the District of Columbia, and 86 countries. The average freshman retention rate, an indicator of student success and satisfaction, is 85.7 percent. In 2020, the student body included over 1,100 transfer students.

===Traditions===

A common greeting on campus is &quot;Hotty Toddy!&quot;, which is also used in the school chant. The phrase has no explicit meaning and its origin is unknown. The chant was first published in 1926, but &quot;Hotty Toddy&quot; was spelled &quot;Heighty Tighty&quot;; this early spelling has led some to suggest it originated with Virginia Tech&#x27;s regimental band, The Heighty Tighties. Other proposed origins are &quot;&quot;, meaning snobbish, and the alcoholic drink hot toddy.

On football game days, the Grove, a plot of trees, hosts an elaborate tailgating tradition; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Perhaps there isn&#x27;t a word for the ritualized pregame revelry ... &#x27;Tailgating&#x27; certainly does not do it justice&quot;. The tradition began in 1991 when cars were banned from the Grove. Prior to each game, over 2,000 red-and-blue trash cans are placed throughout the Grove. This event is known as &quot;Trash Can Friday&quot;. Each barrel marks a tailgating spot. The spots are claimed by tailgaters, who erect a &quot;tent city&quot; of 2,500 shelters. Many of the tents are extravagant, feature chandeliers and fine china, and typically host meals of Southern cuisine. To accommodate the crowds, the university maintains elaborate portable bathrooms on 18-wheeler platforms known as &quot;Hotty Toddy Potties&quot;.

===Student organizations===
The University of Mississippi&#x27;s first sanctioned student organizations, literary societies the Hermaean Society and the Phi Sigma Society, were established in 1849. Weekly meetings, of which attendance was mandatory, were held in the Lyceum until 1853 and then in the chapel. With the university&#x27;s emphasis on rhetoric, student-organized public orations on the first Monday of every month were popular. Studies were sometimes canceled so students could attend speeches of visiting politicians such as Jefferson Davis and William L. Sharkey.

In the 1890s, extracurricular and nonintellectual activities proliferated on campus, and interest in oratory and the now-voluntary literary societies diminished. Turn-of-the-20th-century student organizations included Cotillion Club, the elite Stag Club, and German Club. In the 1890s, the local YMCA began publishing a list of the organizations in the &quot;M-Book&quot;. As of 2021, the handbook was still provided to students.

The Associated Student Body (ASB), which was established in 1917, is the university&#x27;s student government organization. Students are elected to the ASB Senate in the spring semester and leftover seats are voted on in open-seat elections in the fall. Senators can represent registered student organizations such as the Greek councils and sports clubs, or they can run to represent their academic school. The University of Mississippi&#x27;s marching band The Pride of the South performs in-concert and at athletic events. The band was formally organized in 1928, but it existed before that date as a smaller organization led by a student director. A Phi Beta Kappa chapter was established in 2001.

===Amenities===
Approximately 5,300 students live on campus in thirteen residence halls, two residential colleges, and two apartment complexes. Students are required to live on-campus during their first year. Within residence halls, students designated as community assistants provide information and resolve issues. In the early 20th century, the university provided cottages for married students. In 1947, Vet Village was constructed to room the surge in World War II veteran applicants.

The University of Mississippi provides Oxford University Transit, a shuttle system that is free of charge for students, faculty, and staff. In early 2020, Starship Technologies introduced an automated food delivery consisting of a fleet of 30 robots on campus; it was the first such system of any SEC school.

On-campus dining services Catering at UM and the Rebel Market are the only Certified Green restaurants in the state of Mississippi. In 2019, the university opened a recreation center containing a gym, indoor climbing wall, basketball courts, and other services.

===Greek life===
Greek life at the University of Mississippi comprises 33 organizations and around 8,700 affiliated students. Greek societies at the University of Mississippi are housed along Fraternity Row and Sorority Row, which were constructed in the 1930s with federal funds.

The Rainbow Fraternity, which was founded at the University of Mississippi in 1848, was the first fraternity to be founded in the South. Other early fraternities established at the university include Delta Kappa Epsilon (1850), Delta Kappa (1853), Delta Psi (1854), and Epsilon Alpha (1855). By 1900, a majority of University of Mississippi students were members of a fraternity or a sorority. Non-member students felt excluded on campus and tensions between members and non-members escalated. &quot;The University Magazine&quot; denounced the Greek societies as &quot;the most vicious institution that has grown up in any college&quot;. In 1902, Lee Russell, a poor student who was rejected by the fraternities, appeared before the board of trustees to criticize the Greek societies. In response, the board threatened to abolish Greek life if non-member students continued to be ostracized. In 1903, rumors Greek-life members and non-member students were preparing to &quot;meet in combat&quot; appeared. Multiple state-legislative investigations were held to address the issue. All Greek life at the university was suspended from 1912 to 1926 due to statewide anti-fraternity legislation.

As part of a larger crackdown on embarrassing fraternity incidents, Chancellor Gerald Turner ended the traditional Shrimp and Beer Festival in 1984. In 1988, Phi Beta Sigma, a black fraternity, was preparing to move into a house on the all-white Fraternity Row when arsonists burned their house. An alumnus helped purchase another house and Fraternity Row was integrated two months later. In a 1989 incident, fraternity members dropped naked students painted with racist slurs at the historically black Rust College. In 2014, three fraternity members placed a noose and a Confederate symbol on the Meredith statue, and in 2019, fraternity members posed with guns in front of an Emmett Till historical marker.

===Media===
The first student publication at the University of Mississippi was &quot;The University Magazine&quot;, which was founded in 1856 and published by the literary societies. The rivalry between the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State originated from an 1895 condemnation by &quot;The University Magazine&quot; of a Mississippi State publication which had written that the University of Mississippi &quot;lacked dignity&quot;. The first student newspaper &quot;The University Record&quot; began publication in 1898; it and the &quot;Magazine&quot; suffered financially and were suspended in 1902.

In 1907, the YMCA and student athletic organization revived the university&#x27;s newspaper as the &quot;Varsity Voice&quot;. In 1911, this newspaper was superseded by another student-published newspaper, &quot;The Daily Mississippian&quot;. The paper is editorially independent and is the only daily college newspaper in the state. The paper is also published online as &quot;TheDMonline.com&quot;, with supplementary content.

&quot;NewsWatch&quot;, which was established in 1980, is a student-produced, live newscast and the only local newscast in Lafayette County. The University of Mississippi owns and operates WUMS 92.1 Rebel Radio, which began broadcasting in 1989; it is one of a few university-operated commercial FM radio stations in the United States.

==Athletics==

The University of Mississippi&#x27;s athletic teams participate in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Southeastern Conference (SEC), Division I as the Ole Miss Rebels.

Men&#x27;s varsity teams are baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, tennis, and track and field.

In 1893, professor Alexander Bondurant organized the university&#x27;s football team. As collegiate athletic teams began to receive names, a contest result selected the name &quot;Mississippi Flood&quot; in 1929. Due to the lasting harm of the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, however, the name was changed to the &quot;Rebels&quot; in 1936. The first prime-time telecast of college football was of a 1969 Ole Miss game. The team has won six SEC championships. Major rivals include Louisiana State University and Mississippi State University, which Ole Miss plays against in the Magnolia Bowl and Egg Bowl, respectively. Other rivalries include Tulane and Vanderbilt. Football alumni Archie and Eli Manning, both quarterbacks, are honored on campus with speed limits set to 18 and 10 mph; their respective jersey numbers.

Outside football, Ole Miss baseball has won seven overall SEC championships and three SEC Tournaments. They have played in the Men&#x27;s College World Series six times, and won the 2022 series. The men&#x27;s tennis team has won five overall SEC championships and has had one NCAA Singles Champion—Devin Britton. The women&#x27;s basketball team has won one overall SEC championship. Notable former players include Armintie Price, who holds the SEC record for steals in a game and was the third pick in the 2007 WNBA draft, and Jennifer Gillom, 1986 SEC Female Athlete of the Year and 1988 Olympic Gold Medalist. Men&#x27;s basketball has won two SEC Tournaments. In 2021, Ole Miss women&#x27;s golf won its first NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Golf Championship.

<text>The Canadian Baseball League was an independent minor league that operated in 2003. The league&#x27;s only Commissioner was Major League Baseball Hall of Famer and Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame member Ferguson Jenkins. The league featured former major league players such as Francisco Cabrera, Floyd Youmans, Rich Butler, Steve Sinclair.

The CBL was based in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The championship trophy was the Jenkins Cup, named after the commissioner of the league, Ferguson Jenkins.

==History==
The CBL was the brainchild of Tony Riviera, a former major league scout, and the face of the league. It was backed by former Microsoft product developer Charlton Lui, and later by former Yahoo! president, and part owner of the San Francisco Giants, Jeff Mallett. Canadian Baseball Hall of Famer Ferguson Jenkins was brought in to act as the league&#x27;s Commissioner.

Riviera&#x27;s vision had big goals, and he followed suit by making big promises. Riviera stated that the CBL would be &quot;AAA quality&quot;, He was rumoured to have approached the Winnipeg Goldeyes about switching leagues, and even nominated Pete Rose for the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

The big plans initially appeared to be possible. The league announced a national television deal with sports channel The Score, while a crowd of 5,100 took in the league&#x27;s inaugural game in London, Ontario.

===Quick demise===
However, despite early promises that the league could, and would, average over 2,000 fans per game, it was clear that the CBL was not remotely close to projections. Only two markets averaged over 1,000 fans per game: Victoria at 1,700 and Calgary at 1,000. Four teams averaged fewer than 300 per game: Kelowna (271), Saskatoon (256), Welland (181) and Trois-Rivières (163). The national TV deal was cancelled after only six weeks after the CBL was unable to find enough sponsors to cover the production costs.

The Montreal franchise never played a game in that city due to a lack of a playing field, as they were denied a lease at Olympic Stadium. Their home games were played at Stade Amedee Roy in Sherbrooke instead.

The Abbotsford Saints relocated to Trois Rivieres, Quebec before the season started.

The CBL&#x27;s swan song was the All-Star game, held at Calgary. Unwilling to absorb any more losses, Mallett pulled the plug on the league, suspending operations the day before the game. A crowd of over 5,700 (the largest crowd to come to Burns Park all season) watched the East and West All-Stars play to a 5-5, ten-inning tie. Following the game, a home run derby was held, in which Jamie Gann of Kelowna hit the only dinger, thus giving the West the victory. Despite losing as much as $4 million on the CBL, Mallett initially promised to bring the league back in 2004. However, the remaining assets of the league were quietly auctioned off on December 1, 2003 in Vancouver and the league never returned.
