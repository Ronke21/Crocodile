<text>Levites ( ; ) or Levi are Jewish males who claim patrilineal descent from the Tribe of Levi. The Tribe of Levi descended from Levi, the third son of Jacob and Leah. The surname &quot;Halevi&quot;, which consists of the Hebrew definite article &quot;&quot; &quot;Ha-&quot; (&#x27;the&#x27;) plus &quot;Levi&quot; (&#x27;Levite&#x27;), is not conclusive regarding being a Levite; a titular use of HaLevi indicates being a Levite. The daughter of a Levite is a (&quot;Bat&quot; being Hebrew for &#x27;daughter&#x27;).

The Tribe of Levi served particular religious duties for the Israelites and had political (administering cities of refuge) and educational responsibilities as well. In return, the landed tribes were expected to support the Levites with a tithe (), particularly the tithe known as the First tithe, &quot;ma&#x27;aser rishon&quot;. The Kohanim, a subset of the Levites, were the priests, who performed the work of holiness in the Temple. The Levites, referring to those who were not Kohanim, were specifically assigned to:
* Singing and/or playing music in the Temple
* Serving as guards
* Carrying

When Joshua led the Israelites into the land of Canaan (), the Sons of Levi were the only Israelite tribe that received cities but were not allowed to be landowners &quot;because the Lord the God of Israel Himself is their inheritance&quot; ().

In modern times, Levites are integrated in Jewish communities, but keep a distinct status. There are estimated 300,000 Levites among Ashkenazi Jewish communities, and a similar number among Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews combined. The total percentage of Levites among the wider Jewish population is about 4%.

Most scholars view the Torah as projecting the origins of the Levites into the past to explain their role as landless cultic functionaries.

==In contemporary Jewish practice==
Today, Levites in Orthodox Judaism continue to have additional rights and obligations compared to lay people, although these responsibilities have diminished with the destruction of the Temple. For instance, &quot;Kohanim&quot; are eligible to be called to the Torah first, followed by the Levites. Levites also provide assistance to the &quot;Kohanim&quot;, particularly washing their hands, before the &quot;Kohanim&quot; recite the Priestly Blessing.

Since Levites (and Kohanim) are traditionally pledged to Divine service, there is no Pidyon HaBen (redemption of the firstborn) ceremony for:
* the son of a Kohen&#x27;s or a Levite&#x27;s daughter
* the son of a Kohen or a Levite.

Orthodox Judaism believes in the eventual rebuilding of a Temple in Jerusalem and a resumption of the Levitical role. A small number of schools, primarily in Israel, train priests and Levites in their respective roles.

Conservative Judaism—which believes in a restoration of the Temple as a house of worship and in some special role for Levites, although not the ancient sacrificial system as previously practised—recognizes Levites as having special status. Not all Conservative congregations call Kohanim and Levites to the first and second reading of the Torah, and many no longer perform rituals such as the Priestly Blessing and Pidyon HaBen in which &quot;Kohanim&quot; and Levites have a special role.

Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism do not observe distinctions between Kohanim, Levites, and other Jews.

===Relationship with Kohanim===

The Kohanim are traditionally believed and halachically required to be of direct patrilineal descent from the biblical Aaron of the Tribe of Levi. The origins of the name/term &quot;Levy&quot; in Hebrew remain unclear. Some hypotheses link this name with the Hebrew root &quot;lwh&quot;, the Aramaic root &quot;lwy&quot;, or the Arabic root &quot;lwy&quot;.

The noun &quot;kohen&quot; is used in the Torah to refer to priests, both Israelite and non-Israelite, such as the Israelite nation as a whole, as well as the priests (Hebrew &quot;kohanim&quot;) of Baal. During the existence of the Temple in Jerusalem, Kohanim performed the daily and holiday (Yom Tov) duties of sacrificial offerings.

Today &quot;kohanim&quot; retain a lesser though somewhat distinct status within Judaism, and are bound by additional restrictions according to Orthodox Judaism. During the Priestly Blessing, the Levites traditionally wash the hands of the Kohanim prior to the blessing of the House of Israel. (&quot;A first-born son washes the Kohen&#x27;s hands if there is no Levite&quot;.)

===Bat Levi===

In Orthodox Judaism, children of a Bat Levi, like those of a Bat-Kohen, regardless of the child&#x27;s father&#x27;s tribe or the mother&#x27;s marital status, retain the traditional exemption for their children from the requirement of being redeemed through the Pidyon HaBen.

Conservative Judaism permits a Bat Levi to perform essentially all the rituals a male Levi would perform, including being called to the Torah for the Levite aliyah in those Conservative synagogues which have both retained traditional tribal roles and modified traditional gender roles. In Israel, Conservative/Masorti Judaism has not extended Torah honors either to a bat Kohen or to a bat Levi.

===The Levites and the Holocaust===
In 1938, with the outbreak of violence that would come to be known as Kristallnacht, American Orthodox rabbi Menachem HaKohen Risikoff wrote about the central role he saw for Priests and Levites in terms of Jewish and world responses, in worship, liturgy, and &quot;teshuva&quot;, repentance. In &quot;The Priests and the Levites&quot; (1940), he stressed that members of these groups exist in the realm between history (below) and redemption (above), and must act in a unique way to help move others to prayer and action, and help bring an end to suffering. He wrote, &quot;Today, we also are living through a time of flood, Not of water, but of a bright fire, which burns and turns Jewish life into ruin. We are now drowning in a flood of blood. ... Through the Kohanim and Levi&#x27;im help will come to all Israel.&quot;

==Levite population==

===Levite Y-chromosome studies===
A 2003 study of the Y-chromosome by Behar et al. pointed to multiple origins for Ashkenazi Levites, who comprise approximately 4% among the Ashkenazi Jews. It found that Haplogroup R1a1a (R-M17), uncommon in the Middle East or among Sephardic Jews, is present in over 50% of Ashkenazi Levites, while the rest of Ashkenazi Levites&#x27; paternal lineage is of certain Middle Eastern origin, including Y-chromosome haplogroups E3b, J2, F, R1b, K, I, Q, N and L. Haplogroup R1a1a is found at the highest levels among people of Eastern European descent, with 50 to 65% among Sorbs, Poles, Russians, and Ukrainians. In South Asia, R1a1a has often been observed with high frequency in a number of demographic groups, reaching over 70% in West Bengal Brahmins in India and among the Mohani people in Sindh, Pakistan. Behar&#x27;s data suggested a founding event, involving an &#x27;introgression&#x27; of anywhere from one to fifty non-Jewish European men, occurring at a time close to the initial formation and settlement of the Ashkenazi community as a possible explanation. As Nebel, Behar and Goldstein speculate:

A 2013 paper by Siiri Rootsi et al. confirmed a Near or Middle Eastern origin for all Ashkenazi Levites, including the R1a Y-chromosome carriers, and refuted the Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry:
In a later 2017 study Behar et al. revised their initially mitigated position, concluding that a &quot;Middle Eastern origin of the Ashkenazi Levite lineage based on what was previously a relatively limited number of reported samples, can now be considered firmly validated&quot;, precising that a &quot;rich variation of haplogroup R1a outside of Europe which is phylogenetically separate from the typically European R1a branches&quot;, referring to the R1a-Y2619 sub-clade.

===Lineage===
Having a last name of Levi or a related term does not necessarily mean a person is a Levite, and many well-known Levites do not have such last names.

Levitical status is passed down in families from father to child born from a Jewish mother, as part of a family&#x27;s genealogical tradition. Tribal status of Levite is determined by patrilineal descent, so a child whose biological father is a Levite (in cases of adoption or artificial insemination, status is determined by the genetic father), is also considered a Levite. Jewish status is determined by matrilineal descent, thus conferring levitical status onto children requires both biological parents to be Israelites and the biological father to be a Levite.

Accordingly, there is currently no branch of Judaism that regards levitical status as conferrable by matrilineal descent. It is either conferrable patrilineally with a Jewish mother, in the traditional manner, or it does not exist and is not conferred at all.

===Levite surnames===

<text>Benjamin Banneker (November 9, 1731October 19, 1806) was an American naturalist, mathematician, astronomer and almanac author. A landowner, he also worked as a surveyor and farmer.

Born in Baltimore County, Maryland, to a free African-American mother and a father who had formerly been enslaved, Banneker had little or no formal education and was largely self-taught. He became known for assisting Major Andrew Ellicott in a survey that established the original borders of the District of Columbia, the federal capital district of the United States.

Banneker&#x27;s knowledge of astronomy helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with Thomas Jefferson on the topics of slavery and racial equality. Abolitionists and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker&#x27;s works. Although a fire on the day of Banneker&#x27;s funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining artifacts survived.

Banneker became a folk-hero after his death, leading to many accounts of his life being exaggerated or embellished. The names of parks, schools and streets commemorate him and his works, as do other tributes.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland, to Mary Banneky, a free black woman, and Robert, a freed slave from Guinea who died in 1759. There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker&#x27;s family history.

Banneker himself and his earliest biographers described him as having only African ancestry. None of Banneker&#x27;s surviving papers describe a white ancestor or identify the name of his grandmother.

However, later biographers have contended that Banneker&#x27;s mother was the child of Molly Welsh, a former white indentured servant, and an African slave named Banneka. The first published description of Molly Welsh was based on interviews with her descendants that took place in 1836, long after the deaths of both Molly and Benjamin. According to that story, Molly purchased Banneka to help establish a farm located near the future site of Ellicott&#x27;s Mills, Maryland, west of Baltimore.

A biographer suggested in 2002 that Banneka may have been a member of the Dogon people, who several anthropologists have claimed had an early knowledge of astronomy (see Dogon astronomical beliefs). Molly supposedly freed and married Banneka, who may have shared his knowledge of astronomy with her. The biographer suggested that Benjamin acquired this knowledge from Molly, as Benjamin was born after Banneka&#x27;s death.

A genealogist who in 2016 reported an analysis of records related to Banneker&#x27;s family tree was unable to identify any documents that showed that Banneker had a white grandmother, but could not rule out that possibility. The report noted that the name &quot;Bannaker&quot; may have had the same origin as that of Banaka, a small village in the present-day Klay District of Bomi County in northwestern Liberia that had once participated in the African slave trade. A 2021 update to this genealogy stated that Benjamin Banneker&#x27;s father, Robert, was by May 18, 1731, married to Mary Lett (then called Mary Beneca), the daughter of a white woman by an enslaved man. The update noted that Banaka is the home of the Vai people, who have lived there since about 1500 when they left the Mali Empire.
In 1737, Banneker was named at the age of 6 on the deed of his family&#x27;s farm in the Patapsco Valley in rural Baltimore County. A letter writer stated in 1791 that Banneker&#x27;s parents had sent him to an obscure school where he learned reading, writing and arithmetic as far as double position. However, the remainder of Banneker&#x27;s early life is not well documented.

Unverified accounts that first appeared in books published more than 140 years after Banneker&#x27;s death relate that, as a young teenager, Banneker met and befriended Peter Heinrich, a Quaker who later established a school near the Banneker family farm. (Quakers were leaders in the anti-slavery movement and advocates of racial equality (see Quakers in the abolition movement and Testimony of equality)). These accounts state that Heinrich shared his personal library and provided Banneker with his only classroom instruction. Banneker&#x27;s formal education (if any) presumably ended when he was old enough to help on his family&#x27;s farm.

===Notable works===
Around 1753, at about the age of 21, Banneker reportedly completed a wooden clock that struck on the hour. He appears to have modelled his clock from a borrowed pocket watch by carving each piece to scale. The clock continued to work until his death.

After his father died in 1759, Banneker lived with his mother and sisters. In 1768, he signed a Baltimore County petition to move the county seat from Joppa to Baltimore. An entry for his property in a 1773 Baltimore County tax list identified Banneker as the only adult member of his household.

In 1772, brothers Andrew Ellicott, John Ellicott and Joseph Ellicott moved from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and bought land along the Patapsco Falls near Banneker&#x27;s farm on which to construct gristmills, around which the village of Ellicott&#x27;s Mills (now Ellicott City) subsequently developed. The Ellicotts were Quakers who held the same views on racial equality as did many of their faith. Banneker studied the mills and became acquainted with their proprietors.

In 1788, George Ellicott, a son of Andrew Ellicott, loaned Banneker books and equipment to begin a more formal study of astronomy. During the following year, Banneker sent George his work calculating a solar eclipse.

In 1790, Banneker prepared an ephemeris for 1791, which he hoped would be placed within a published almanac. However, he was unable to find a printer that was willing to publish and distribute the work.

====Survey of the original boundaries of the District of Columbia====

In early 1791, U.S. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson asked surveyor Major Andrew Ellicott (a son of Joseph Ellicott and a cousin of George Ellicott) to survey an area that would contain a new federal district. In February 1791, Ellicott left a surveying team that he had been leading in western New York so that he could begin the district&#x27;s survey. Ellicott then hired Banneker as a replacement to assist in the initial survey of the federal district&#x27;s boundaries, advancing him $60 for travel expenses to and at Georgetown.

The territory that became the original District of Columbia was formed from land along the Potomac River that the states of Maryland and Virginia ceded to the federal government of the United States in accordance with the 1790 federal Residence Act and later legislation. The territory was a square that measured on each side, totaling (see: Founding of Washington, D.C.). Ellicott&#x27;s team placed boundary marker stones at or near every mile point along the borders of the new capital territory (see: Boundary markers of the original District of Columbia).

Biographers have stated that Banneker&#x27;s duties on the survey consisted primarily of making astronomical observations and calculations to establish base points, including one at Jones Point in Alexandria, Virginia, where the survey started and where the south corner stone was to be located. They have also stated that Banneker maintained a clock that he used to relate points on the ground to the positions of stars at specific times.
However, some have noted that Banneker&#x27;s actual role in the survey is uncertain, as his involvement in the effort &quot;rests on extremely meager documentation&quot;. An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south corner stone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who &quot;ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed&quot;. The news report did not mention Banneker&#x27;s name.

Banneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because the time that he was devoting to the project was conflicting with the time that he had expected to use to calculate an ephemeris for the year of 1792. Further, the arrival of spring required him to direct more attention to his farm than was needed during the winter. In addition, Andrew Ellicott&#x27;s younger brothers, Benjamin and Joseph Ellicott, who usually assisted Andrew, had completed the New York survey and were able to join the survey of the federal district at around that time.

Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott&#x27;s Mills. The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791. The team laid the Maryland stones and completed the boundary survey in 1792.

====Banneker&#x27;s almanacs====
After returning to Ellicott&#x27;s Mills, Banneker made astronomical calculations that predicted eclipses and planetary conjunctions for inclusion in an almanac and ephemeris for the year of 1792. To aid Banneker in his efforts to have his almanac published, Andrew Ellicott (who had been authoring almanacs and ephemerides of his own since 1780) forwarded Banneker&#x27;s ephemeris to James Pemberton, the president of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage.
Pemberton then asked William Waring, a Philadelphia mathematician and ephemeris calculator, and David Rittenhouse, a prominent American astronomer, almanac author, surveyor and scientific instrument maker who was at the time serving as the president of the American Philosophical Society, to confirm the accuracy of Banneker&#x27;s work. Waring endorsed Banneker&#x27;s work, stating, &quot;I have examined Benjamin Banneker&#x27;s Almanac for 1792, and am of the Opinion that it well deserves the Acceptance and Encouragement of the Public.&quot;

Rittenhouse responded to Pemberton by stating that Banneker&#x27;s ephemeris &quot;was a very extraordinary performance, considering the Colour of the Author&quot; and that he &quot;had no doubt that the Calculations are sufficiently accurate for the purposes of a common Almanac. ... Every instance of Genius amongst the Negroes is worthy of attention, because their suppressors seem to lay great stress on their supposed inferior mental abilities.&quot; A biographer wrote that Banneker replied to Rittenhouse&#x27;s endorsement by stating: &quot;I am annoyed to find that the subject of my race is so much stressed. The work is either correct or it is not. In this case, I believe it to be perfect.&quot;
Pemberton then made arrangements for Joseph Crukshank (a Philadelphia Quaker who was a founder of the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery and who had since 1770 been publishing almanacs, including at least one that Waring had calculated) to print Banneker&#x27;s almanac. Having thus secured the support of Pemberton, Rittenhouse and Waring, Banneker delivered a manuscript containing his ephemeris to William Goddard, a Baltimore printer who had published &quot;The Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia Almanack and Ephemeris&quot; for every year since 1782. Goddard then agreed to print and distribute Banneker&#x27;s work within an almanac and ephemeris for the year of 1792.

Banneker&#x27;s &quot;Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia Almanack and Ephemeris, for the Year of our Lord, 1792&quot; was the first in a six-year series of almanacs and ephemerides that printers agreed to publish and sell. At least 28 editions of the almanacs, some of which appeared during the same year, were printed in seven cities in five states: Baltimore; Philadelphia; Wilmington, Delaware; Alexandria, Virginia; Petersburg, Virginia; Richmond, Virginia; and Trenton, New Jersey.
The title pages of the Baltimore editions of Banneker&#x27;s 1792, 1793 and 1794 almanacs and ephemerides stated that the publications contained:

the Motions of the Sun and Moon, the True Places and Aspects of the Planets, the Rising and Setting of the Sun, Place and Age of the Moon, &amp;c. – The s, Conjunctions, Eclipses, Judgment of the Weather, Festivals, and other remarkable Days; Days for holding the Supreme and Circuit Courts of the &quot;United States&quot;, as also the useful Courts in &quot;Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland&quot;, and &quot;Virginia.&quot; Also – several useful Tables, and valuable Receipts. – Various Selections from the Commonplace–Book of the &quot;Kentucky Philosopher&quot;, an &quot;American Sage&quot;; with interesting and entertaining Essays, in Prose and Verse –the whole comprising a greater, more pleasing, and useful Variety than any Work of the &quot;Kind&quot; and &quot;Price&quot; in &quot;North America&quot;.


In addition to the information that its title page described, the 1792 almanac contained a tide table listing the methods for calculating the time of high water at four locations along the Chesapeake Bay (Cape Charles and Point Lookout, Virginia; Annapolis and Baltimore, Maryland). Later almanacs contained tables for making such calculations for those locations as well as for Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Halifax, Quebec, Hatteras, Nantucket and other places. Monthly tables in each edition listed astronomical data and weather predictions for each of the months&#x27; dates.

A Philadelphia edition of Banneker&#x27;s 1795 almanac contained a lengthy account of a yellow fever epidemic that had struck that city in 1793. Written by a committee whose president was the city&#x27;s mayor, Matthew Clarkson, the account related the presumed origins and causes of the epidemic, as well as the extent and duration of the event.

The title pages of two Baltimore editions of Banneker&#x27;s 1795 almanac had woodcut portraits of him as he may have appeared. However, a biographer later concluded that the portraits were more likely portrayals of an idealized African-American youth.

A Baltimore edition of Banneker&#x27;s 1796 almanac contained a table enumerating the population of each U.S. state and the Southwest Territory as recorded in the 1790 United States census. The table listed the number of free persons and slaves in each state and the territory according to race and gender, as well as to whether they were above or below the age of 16 years. The table also listed the number of members of the U.S. House of Representatives that each state had during the almanac&#x27;s year. 
The almanacs&#x27; editors prefaced the publications with adulatory references to Banneker and his race. Editions of Banneker&#x27;s 1792 and 1793 almanacs contained full or abridged copies of a lengthy commendatory letter that James McHenry, the Secretary of the 1787 United States Constitutional Convention and self-described friend of Banneker, had written to Goddard and his partner, James Angell, in August 1791 to support the almanac&#x27;s publication.

As first published in Banneker&#x27;s 1792 almanac and later given an increased circulation when re-published in Philadelphia within &quot;The American Museum, or Universal Magazine&quot;, McHenry&#x27;s full letter began:
Benjamin Banneker, a free Negro, has calculated an Almanack, for the ensuing year, 1792, which being desirous to dispose of, to the best advantage, he has requested me to aid his application to you for that purpose. Having fully satisfied myself, in respect to his title to this type of authorship, if you can agree to him for the price of his work, I may venture to assure you it will do you credit, as Editors, while it will afford you the opportunity to encourage talents that have thus far surmounted the most discouraging circumstances and prejudices.&quot;

In their preface to Banneker&#x27;s 1792 almanac, the editors of the work wrote that they:feel themselves gratified in the Opportunity of presenting to the Public, through the Medium of their Press, what must be considered as an extraordinary Effort of Genius — a complete and accurate EPHEMERIS for the Year 1792, calculated by a Descendant of Africa, ... — They flatter themselves that a philanthropic Public, in this enlightened Era, will be induced to give their Patronage and Support to this Work, not only on Account of its intrinsic Merit, (it having met the of several of the most distinguished Astronomers in America, particularly the celebrated Mr. Rittenhouse) but from similar Motives to those which induced the Editors to give this Calculation the Preference, the ardent desire of drawing modest Merit from Obscurity, and controverting the long-established illiberal Prejudice against the Blacks.

After Goddard and Angell had published their 1792 Baltimore edition of the almanac, Angell wrote in the 1793 edition (which he alone edited) that abolitionists William Pitt, Charles James Fox and William Wilberforce had introduced the 1792 edition into the British House of Commons to aid their effort to end the British slave trade in Africa. However, the British Parliament&#x27;s report of the debate that accompanied this effort did not mention either Banneker or his almanac.

The title page of a Petersburg edition of Banneker&#x27;s 1794 &quot;Virginia Almanack&quot; stated that the work was &quot;Calculated by that ingenious self taught astronomer Benjamin Banneker, a black man&quot;, repeating a term that Angell had used in the 1793 Baltimore almanac. The introduction to a 1795 Philadelphia edition contained a poem titled: &quot;Addressed to Benjamin Banneker&quot;. The verse began and ended:

Fain would the muse exalt her tuneful lays,&lt;br&gt;And chant in strains sublime Banneker&#x27;s praise;Fain would the soar on Fame&#x27;s majestic wing,&lt;br&gt;Thy &quot;genius&quot;, great Banneker, to sing;Thy &quot;talents&quot; and thy &quot;greatness&quot; would I shew,&lt;br&gt;Not in applausive strains to thee undue;...&lt;br&gt;Long may thou live an &quot;evidence&quot; to shew,&lt;br&gt;That &quot;Afric&#x27;s&quot; sable race have &quot;talents&quot; too.&lt;br&gt; And may thy genius bright its &quot;strength&quot; retain;Tho&#x27; nature to decline may still remain;&lt;br&gt;And may favour us to thy &quot;latest&quot; yearsWith thy &quot;Ephemeris&quot; call&#x27;d Banneker&#x27;s.&lt;br&gt;A work which ages yet &quot;unborn&quot; shall nameAnd be the &quot;monument&quot; of lasting &quot;fame&quot;;&lt;br&gt;A work which after ages shall &quot;adore&quot;,When Banneker, alas! shall be &quot;no more!&quot;

The writer of a tribute in a 1796 Baltimore edition quoted a quatrain and amended another that an Englishman, Thomas Gray, had placed in a popular poem first published in 1751 (see Adaptations and parodies of &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot;). The revised rhyme stated:
Nor you ye proud, impute to these the blameIf Afric&#x27;s sons to genius are unknown,For Banneker has prov&#x27;d they may acquire a name,As bright, as lasting, as your own.

Supported by Andrew, George and Elias Ellicott and heavily promoted by the Maryland and Pennsylvania abolition societies, the early editions of the almanacs achieved commercial success. Printers then distributed at least nine editions of Banneker&#x27;s 1795 almanac. A Wilmington, Delaware, printer issued five editions for distribution by different vendors. Printers in Baltimore issued three versions of the almanac, while three Philadelphia printers also sold editions. A Trenton, New Jersey, printer additionally sold a version of the work.

In 1796, Banneker gave a manuscript of one of his almanacs to Suzanna Mason, a member of the Ellicott family who was visiting his home. In 1836, Mason&#x27;s daughter wrote a published memoir of her mother&#x27;s life, letters and manuscripts. The memoir contained a copy of a poem that Mason had sent to Banneker shortly after her 1796 visit. A portion of the verse stated:But thou, a man exhalted high,&lt;br&gt;Conspicuous in the world&#x27;s keen eye,&lt;br&gt;On record now thy name&#x27;s enrolled,&lt;br&gt;And future ages will be told,&lt;br&gt;There lived a man called Banneker,&lt;br&gt;An African astronomer.

====Banneker&#x27;s journals====
Banneker kept a series of journals that contained his notebooks for astronomical observations, his diary and accounts of his dreams. The journals, only one of which escaped a fire on the day of his funeral, additionally contained a number of mathematical calculations and puzzles.

The surviving journal described in April 1800 Banneker&#x27;s recollections of the 1749, 1766 and 1783 emergences of Brood X of the seventeen-year periodical cicada (&quot;Magicicada septendecim&quot; and related species) and stated, &quot;... they may be expected again in they year 1800 which is Seventeen Since their third appearance to me.&quot; Describing an effect that the pathogenic fungus, &quot;Massospora cicadina&quot;, has on its host, the journal further stated that the insects:... begin to Sing or make a noise from first they come out of the Earth till they die. The hindermost part rots off, and it does not appear to be any pain to them, for they still continue on Singing till they die. The journal also recorded Banneker&#x27;s observations on the hives and behavior of honey bees.

===Political views===
Banneker&#x27;s 1792 almanac contained an extract from an anonymous essay entitled &quot;On Negro Slavery, and the Slave Trade&quot; that the &quot;Columbian Magazine&quot; had published in 1790. After quoting a statement that David Rittenhouse had made (that Negroes &quot;have been doomed to endless slavery by us — merely because &quot;their&quot; bodies have been disposed to reflect or absorb the rays of light in a way different from &quot;ours&quot;&quot;), the extract concluded:The time, it is hoped &quot;is not very remote&quot;, when those ill-fated people, dwelling in this land of freedom, shall commence a participation with the white inhabitants, in the blessings of liberty; and experience the kindly protection of government, for the essential rights of human nature.

A Philadelphia edition of Banneker&#x27;s 1793 almanac that Joseph Crukshank published contained copies of pleas for peace that the English anti-slavery poet William Cowper and others had authored, as well as anti-slavery speeches and writings from England and America. The latter included extracts from speeches that William Pitt, Matthew Montagu and Charles James Fox had given to the British House of Commons in 1792 during the debate on a motion for the abolition of the British slave trade, an extract from a 1789 poem by an English Quaker, Thomas Wilkinson, and an extract from a query in Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s 1787 &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;.
Crukshank&#x27;s edition of Banneker&#x27;s 1793 almanac also contained a copy of &quot;A Plan of a &quot;Peace-Office&quot;, for the United States&quot;. Although the almanac did not identify the Plan&#x27;s author, writers later attributed the work to Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the 1776 Declaration of Independence.

The Plan proposed the appointment of a &quot;Secretary of Peace&quot;, described the Secretary&#x27;s powers and advocated federal support and promotion of the Christian religion. The Plan stated:
I. Let a Secretary of Peace be appointed to preside in this office; ...; let him be a genuine republican and a sincere Christian, ...

II. Let a power be given to the Secretary to establish and maintain free schools in every city, village and township in the United States; ... Let the youth of our country be instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and in the doctrines of a religion of some kind; the Christian religion should be preferred to all others; for it belongs to this religion exclusively to teach us not only to cultivate peace with all men, but to forgive—nay more, to love our very enemies. ...

III. Let every family be furnished at public expense, by the Secretary of this office, with an American edition of the Bible. ...

IV. Let the following sentence be inscribed in letters of gold over the door of every home in the United States: THE SON OF MAN CAME INTO THE WORLD, NOT TO DESTROY MEN&#x27;S LIVES, BUT TO SAVE THEM.

V. To inspire a veneration for human life, and a horror at the shedding of human blood, let all those laws be repealed which authorise juries, judges, sheriffs, or hangmen to assume the resentments of individuals, and to commit murder in cold blood in any case whatever. ...

VI. To subdue that passion for war, ... militia laws should everywhere be repealed, and military dresses and military titles should be laid aside. ...

====Correspondence with Thomas Jefferson====

On August 19, 1791, after departing the federal capital area, Banneker wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson, who in 1776 had drafted the United States Declaration of Independence and in 1791 was serving as United States Secretary of State. Quoting language in the Declaration, the letter expressed a plea for justice for African Americans.

To support his plea, Banneker included within his letter a handwritten manuscript of an almanac for 1792 containing his ephemeris with his astronomical calculations. He retained handwritten copies of the letter and Jefferson&#x27;s August 30, 1791, reply in a volume of manuscripts that became part of a journal.

In late 1792, James Angell published a Baltimore edition of Banneker&#x27;s 1793 almanac that contained copies of Banneker&#x27;s letter and Jefferson&#x27;s reply. Soon afterwards, a Philadelphia printer distributed two sequential editions of a widely circulated pamphlet that also contained the letter and reply.

&quot;The Universal Asylum, and Columbian Magazine&quot; also published Banneker&#x27;s letter and Jefferson&#x27;s reply in Philadelphia in late 1792. The &quot;Magazine&quot; editors (A Society of Gentlemen) titled the letter as being &quot;from the famous self-taught astronomer, Benjamin Banneker, a black man&quot;.

In his letter, Banneker accused Jefferson of criminally using fraud and violence to oppress his slaves by stating:

... Sir, how pitiable is it to reflect, that altho you were so fully convinced of the benevolence of the Father of mankind, and of his equal and impartial distribution of those rights and privileges which he had conferred upon them, that you should at the same time counteract his mercies, in detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a part of my brethren under groaning captivity and cruel oppression, that you should at the Same time be found guilty of that most criminal act, which you professedly detested in others, with respect to your Selves.

The letter ended:

And now Sir, I Shall conclude and Subscribe my Self with the most profound respect,&lt;br&gt;Your most Obedient humble Servant&lt;br&gt;Benjamin Banneker

Jefferson&#x27;s reply did not directly respond to Banneker&#x27;s accusations, but instead expressed his support for the advancement of his &quot;black brethren&quot;. His reply, which writers have characterized as &quot;courteous&quot;, &quot;polite&quot;, &quot;ambivalent&quot;, &quot;ambiguous&quot;, &quot;evasive&quot;, &quot;tepid&quot; and &quot;noncommittal&quot;, stated:

Philadelphia Aug. 30. 1791.&lt;br&gt;Sir,&lt;br&gt;I thank you sincerely for your letter of the 19th. instant and for the Almanac it contained. no body wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colours of men, &amp; that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence both in Africa &amp; America. I can add with truth that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition both of their body &amp; mind to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecillity of their present existence, and other circumstance which cannot be neglected, will admit. I have taken the liberty of sending your almanac to Monsieur de Condorcet, Secretary of the Academy of sciences at Paris, and member of the Philanthropic society because I considered it as a document to which your whole colour had a right for their justification against the doubts which have been entertained of them. I am with great esteem, Sir,&lt;br&gt;Your most obedt. humble servt.&lt;br&gt;Th: Jefferson
Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, to whom Jefferson sent Banneker&#x27;s almanac, was a noted French mathematician and abolitionist who was a member of the French Société des Amis des Noirs (Society of the Friends of the Blacks). It appears that the Academy of Sciences itself did not receive the almanac.

When writing his letter, Banneker informed Jefferson that his 1791 work with Andrew Ellicott on the District boundary survey had affected his work on his 1792 ephemeris and almanac by stating:

... And altho I had almost declined to make my calculation for the ensuing year, in consequence of that time which I had allotted therefor being taking up at the Federal Territory by the request of Mr. Andrew Ellicott, ...

On the same day that he replied to Banneker (August 30, 1791), Jefferson sent a letter to the Marquis de Condorcet that contained the following paragraph relating to Banneker&#x27;s race, abilities, almanac and work with Andrew Ellicott:

I am happy to be able to inform you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I procured him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, &amp; in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, &amp; which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy &amp; respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference in the structure of the parts on which intellect depends.

In 1809, three years after Banneker&#x27;s death, Jefferson expressed a different opinion of Banneker in a letter to Joel Barlow that criticized a &quot;diatribe&quot; that a French abolitionist, Henri Grégoire, had written in 1808:
the whole do not amount in point of evidence, to what we know ourselves of Banneker. we know he had spherical trigonometry enough to make almanacs, but not without the suspicion of aid from Ellicot, who was his neighbor &amp; friend, &amp; never missed an opportunity of puffing him. I have a long letter from Banneker which shews him to have had a mind of very common stature indeed.

===Death===
Banneker never married. For reasons that are unclear, the four editions of his 1797 almanac were the last ones that printers published. After selling much of his homesite to the Ellicotts and others, he probably died in his log cabin nine years later on October 19, 1806, aged 74. (Some sources state that Banneker died on Sunday, October 9, 1806, which was actually a Thursday.) His chronic alcoholism, which worsened as he aged, may have contributed to his death.

An obituary concluded:
Mr. Banneker is a prominent instance to prove that a descendant of Africa is susceptible of as great mental improvement and deep knowledge into the mysteries of nature as that of any other nation.

A commemorative obelisk that the Maryland Bicentennial Commission and the State Commission on Afro American History and Culture erected in 1977 near his unmarked grave stands in the yard of the Mount Gilboa African Methodist Episcopal Church in Oella, Maryland (see Mount Gilboa Chapel).

==Artifacts==
On the day of his funeral in 1806, a fire burned Banneker&#x27;s log cabin to the ground, destroying many of his belongings and papers. In 1813, William Goodard, who had published the Baltimore edition of Banneker&#x27;s 1792 almanac (Banneker&#x27;s first published almanac), donated the manuscript for the almanac to the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts.

The Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston holds in its collections the August 17, 1791, handwritten letter that Banneker sent to Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson endorsed the letter as received on August 21, 1791.

The Library of Congress holds a copy of Jefferson&#x27;s August 30, 1791, handwritten reply to Banneker. Jefferson produced this document on a letter copying press made by James Watt &amp; Co. that he used before he sent his reply to Banneker. He retained the copy in his files.

The Library of Congress also holds a copy of Jefferson&#x27;s August 30, 1791, handwritten letter to the Marquis de Condorcet that described Banneker&#x27;s race, abilities, almanac and work with Andrew Ellicott. Jefferson produced this document on his copying press before sending the handwritten letter to the Marquis.

The Library of Congress holds a handwritten duplicate of Jefferson&#x27;s letter to the Marquis de Condorcet. The pagination in the duplicate differs from that in the copy that Jefferson produced on his copying press. The Library attributes the duplicate to Jefferson.

The Princeton University Library holds within its Straus Autograph Collection the recipient&#x27;s copy of the handwritten letter that Jefferson sent to Joel Barlow in 1809. Jefferson&#x27;s letter cited the letter that Banneker had sent to him in 1791. Barlow endorsed Jefferson&#x27;s letter after he received it.

The Library of Congress holds a copy of Jefferson&#x27;s 1809 letter to Joel Barlow that Jefferson had retained in his files after sending his handwritten letter to Barlow. Jefferson used a polygraph device that enabled him to make the copy at the same time that he was writing the original. An Englishman, John Isaac Hawkins, and an American, Charles Willson Peale, had earlier developed this device with the help of Jefferson&#x27;s suggestions.
In 1987, a member of the Ellicott family, which had retained Banneker&#x27;s only remaining journal, donated that document and other Banneker manuscripts to the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore. The family also retained several items that Banneker had used after borrowing them from George Ellicott, as well as some that Banneker himself had owned.

In 1996, a descendant of George Ellicott decided to sell at auction some of those items, including a drop-leaf table, candlesticks, candle molds, maps, letters and diaries. Although supporters of the planned Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Oella, Maryland, had hoped to obtain these and several other items related to Banneker and the Ellicotts, a Virginia investment banker won most of the items with a series of bids that totaled $85,000. The purchaser stated that he expected to keep some of the items and to donate the rest to the planned African American Civil War Memorial museum in Washington, D.C.

In 1997, it was announced that the artifacts would initially be exhibited in the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and then loaned to the Banneker-Douglass Museum in Annapolis, Maryland. After completion of the Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Oella, the artifacts would be loaned to that facility for a period of twenty years. The Oella museum displayed the table, candle molds and candlesticks after it opened in 1998.

==Mythology and commemorations==
A substantial mythology exaggerating Banneker&#x27;s accomplishments has developed during the two centuries that have elapsed since his death, becoming a part of African-American culture. Several such urban legends describe Banneker&#x27;s alleged activities in the Washington, D.C., area around the time that he assisted Andrew Ellicott in the federal district boundary survey. Others involve his clock, his astronomical works, his almanacs and his journals.

A United States postage stamp and the names of a number of recreational and cultural facilities, schools, streets, and other facilities and institutions throughout the United States have commemorated Banneker&#x27;s documented and mythical accomplishments throughout the years since he lived. In 1983, Rita Dove, a future Poet Laureate of the United States, wrote a biographical poem about Banneker while on the faculty of Arizona State University.

<doc id="70581" wikidata="Q2082" url="?curid=70581" title="St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>St. John&#x27;s is the capital and largest city of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is located on the eastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland. The city spans and is the easternmost city in North America (excluding Greenland). The closest European settlement is Fajã Grande, Azores, Portugal, about away.

Its name has been attributed to the belief that John Cabot sailed into the harbour on the Nativity of John the Baptist in 1497, although it is most likely a legend that came with British settlement. A more realistic possibility is that a fishing village with the same name existed without a permanent settlement for most of the 16th century. Indicated as &quot;São João&quot; on a Portuguese map from 1519, it is one of the oldest cities in North America. It was officially incorporated as a city in 1888. With a metropolitan population of approximately 239,316 (as of 16 January 2025), the St. John&#x27;s Metropolitan Area is Canada&#x27;s 22nd-largest metropolitan area and the second-largest Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) in Atlantic Canada, after Halifax, Nova Scotia.

The city has a rich history, having played a role in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the American Revolutionary War, and the War of 1812. Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi received the first transatlantic wireless signal in St. John&#x27;s. Its history and culture have made it into an important tourist destination. St. John&#x27;s was referred to as &quot;&quot; (Johnstown), in the poetry of Donnchadh Ruadh Mac Conmara (1715–1810), and among speakers of the Irish language in Newfoundland.

==History==

===Early history (1500–1799)===
St. John&#x27;s was used by fishermen setting up seasonal camps in the early 1500s. Sebastian Cabot declared in a handwritten Latin text in his original 1545 map that St. John&#x27;s earned its name when he and his father, the Venetian explorer John Cabot, in the service of England, became the first Europeans to sail into the harbour, on the morning of 24 June 1494 (per British and French historians, in 1497), the feast day of Saint John the Baptist. However, the locations of Cabot&#x27;s landfalls are disputed. A series of expeditions to St. John&#x27;s by Portuguese from the Azores took place in the early 16th century, and by 1540, French, Spanish and Portuguese ships crossed the Atlantic annually to fish the waters off the Avalon Peninsula. In the Basque Country, it is a common belief the name of St. John&#x27;s was given by Basque fishermen because the bay of St. John&#x27;s is very similar to the Bay of Pasaia in the Basque Country, where one of the fishing towns is called St. John (in Spanish, San Juan, and in Basque, Donibane).

The earliest record of the location appears as &quot;São João&quot; on a Portuguese map by Pedro Reinel in 1519. When the English mariner John Rut visited St. John&#x27;s in 1527, he found Norman, Breton and Portuguese ships in the harbour. On 3 August 1527, Rut wrote a letter to King Henry VIII on the findings of his voyage to North America; this was the first known letter sent from North America. St. Jehan is shown on Nicolas Desliens&#x27;s world map of 1541, and San Joham is found in João Freire&#x27;s Atlas of 1546.

On 5 August 1583, an English Sea Dog, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, claimed the area as England&#x27;s first overseas colony under Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I. There was no permanent population, however, and Gilbert was lost at sea during his return voyage, thereby ending any immediate plans for settlement.

Bernard Drake&#x27;s Newfoundland Expedition in 1585 landed at Saint John&#x27;s, re-establishing England&#x27;s claim on the area. St. John&#x27;s became a base for his operations, where his ships gathered supplies and fresh water. This expedition virtually wiped out the Spanish and Portuguese fishing industries in the area, and so set the stage for subsequent English and French influence in the region.

By 1620, the fishermen of England&#x27;s West Country controlled most of Newfoundland&#x27;s east coast. In 1627, William Payne, called St. John&#x27;s &quot;the principal prime and chief lot in all the whole country&quot;.

Sometime after 1630, the town of St. John&#x27;s was established as a permanent community. Before this, English fishermen were expressly forbidden by the English government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, to establish permanent settlements along the English-controlled coast.

The population grew slowly in the 17th century: St. John&#x27;s was Newfoundland&#x27;s largest settlement when English naval officers began to take censuses around 1675. The population grew in the summers with the arrival of migratory fishermen. In 1680, fishing ships (mostly from South Devon) set up fishing rooms at St. John&#x27;s, bringing hundreds of Irish men into the port to operate inshore fishing boats.

The town&#x27;s first significant defences were likely erected due to commercial interests, following the temporary seizure of St. John&#x27;s by the Dutch admiral Michiel de Ruyter in June 1665.

The inhabitants fended off a second Dutch attack in 1673, when it was defended by Christopher Martin, an English merchant captain. Martin landed six cannons from his vessel, &quot;Elias Andrews&quot;, and constructed an earthen breastwork and battery near Chain Rock commanding the Narrows leading into the harbour. With only 23 men, the valiant Martin beat off an attack by three Dutch warships. The English government planned to expand these fortifications (Fort William) in around 1689, but construction did not begin until after the French admiral Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville captured and destroyed the town in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign (1696). When 1500 English reinforcements arrived in late 1697, they found rubble where the town and fortifications had stood.

The French attacked St. John&#x27;s again in 1705 (Siege of St. John&#x27;s), and captured it in 1708 (Battle of St. John&#x27;s), devastating civilian structures with fire on each instance.
The harbour remained fortified through most of the 18th and 19th centuries. The final battle of the Seven Years&#x27; War in North America (known as the French and Indian War in the US) was fought in 1762, in St. John&#x27;s. Following a surprise capture of the town by the French early in the year, the British responded and, at the Battle of Signal Hill, the French surrendered St. John&#x27;s to British forces under the command of Colonel William Amherst.

In the late 1700s Fort Amherst and Fort Waldegrave were built to defend the harbour entrance.

====The oldest European settlement in Anglophone North America controversy====
There has been some controversy regarding which European settlement is the oldest in Anglophone North America. As mentioned above, while English fishermen had set up seasonal camps in St. John&#x27;s in the 16th century, they were expressly forbidden by the English government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, to establish permanent settlements along the English-controlled coast. As a result, the town of St. John&#x27;s was not established as a permanent community until after the 1630s. With respect to the oldest surviving permanent English settlements in North America, it was preceded by Jamestown, Virginia (1607), the Cuper&#x27;s Cove colony at Cupids in Newfoundland (1610), St. George&#x27;s, Bermuda (1612), and the Bristol&#x27;s Hope colony at Harbour Grace in Newfoundland (1618). Each of these English settlements were far later than other European settlements in North America, such as St. Augustine, Florida established by Spain in 1565.

===Modern history (1800–present)===
On 24 April 1800, the &quot;United Irish Uprising&quot; occurred when 19 Irish soldiers who were part of the British garrison stationed in Newfoundland mutinied. The mutineers, who were suspected to be members of the Society of United Irishmen, fled to the countryside after the mutiny failed, and were apprehended in a matter of weeks and court-martialled. Of the 17 mutineers captured, 8 were executed, 4 were let go while 5 were sentenced to penal transportation.

The 18th century saw major changes in Newfoundland: population growth, beginnings of government, establishment of churches, reinforcement of commercial ties with North America and development of the seal, salmon and Grand Banks fisheries. St. John&#x27;s population grew slowly. Although it was primarily a fishing station, it was also a garrison, a centre of government and a commercial hub. St. John&#x27;s served as a naval base during the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.
Guglielmo Marconi received the first transatlantic wireless signal in St. John&#x27;s on 12 December 1901 from his wireless station in Poldhu, Cornwall. St. John&#x27;s was the starting point for the first non-stop transatlantic aircraft flight, by Alcock and Brown in a modified Vickers Vimy IV bomber, in June 1919, departing from Lester&#x27;s Field in St. John&#x27;s and ending in a bog near Clifden, Connemara, Ireland. In July 2005, the flight was duplicated by American aviator and adventurer Steve Fossett in a replica Vickers Vimy aircraft, with St. John&#x27;s International Airport substituting for Lester&#x27;s Field (now an urban and residential part of the city).

During the Second World War, the harbour supported Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy ships that were engaged in anti-submarine warfare. It was the site of an American Army Air Force base, Fort Pepperrell, that was established as part of the &quot;Lend-Lease&quot; Destroyers for Bases Agreement between the United Kingdom and United States. The base included several US-manned coast defence guns, and a Canadian-manned battery of two Lend-Lease M1888 guns was at Fort Cape Spear. The base was transferred to Canadian control in 1960 and is now known as CFS St. John&#x27;s. The Knights of Columbus Hostel fire in December 1942 saw 99 military and civilian lives lost.

St. John&#x27;s, and the province as a whole, was gravely affected in the 1990s by the collapse of the northern cod fishery, which had been the driving force of the provincial economy for hundreds of years. After a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation, the city&#x27;s proximity to the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and commercial development. As a result, the St. John&#x27;s area now accounts for about half of the province&#x27;s economic output.

As of 2012, St. John&#x27;s contained 21 National Historic Sites of Canada.

====Fires====
St. John&#x27;s was destroyed by major fires in 1816, 1817, 1819, 1846 and 1892, when each time a large part of the city was destroyed. The most famous was the Great Fire of 1892.

On 12 February 1816:
...about eight o&#x27;clock, a fire broke out in a house in a part of the town in St. John&#x27;s in Newfoundland known by the name of the King&#x27;s Beach, and speedily communicated to the houses adjoining, and burnt with so much fury, that one hundred and twenty houses, the homes of about a thousand men, women, and children, were consumed before the conflagration was stayed.

There were two citywide fires in 1817 &quot;known jointly as &#x27;The Great Fire of 1817&#x27;. Then in 1819 fire &quot;destroyed 120 houses&quot;.

There was a further major fire in 1846, which started at the shop of a cabinetmaker named Hamlin, located on George Street off Queen Street, when a glue pot boiled over. The fire spread along Water and Duckworth Streets destroying all of the buildings in its path aided by the large quantities of seal oil that were stored in the merchants&#x27; premises. The fire was also aided by an attempt to blow up a house on Water Street which scattered burning embers across the city.

The final major conflagration of the nineteenth century began on the afternoon of 8 July 1892 atop Carter&#x27;s Hill on Freshwater Road. Initially, the fire did not cause any widespread panic; however, a series of catastrophic coincidences caused the fire to spread and devour virtually all of the east end of the city, including much of its major commercial area, before being extinguished.

==Geography==
St. John&#x27;s is along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, on the northeast of the Avalon Peninsula in southeast Newfoundland. The city is North America&#x27;s most easterly city, excluding Greenland; it is closer to London, England than it is to Edmonton, Alberta. It is also closer to all of Ireland than to Miami, Florida, United States, also on the east coast of North America. The city is the largest in the province and the second largest in the Atlantic Provinces after Halifax, Nova Scotia. Its downtown area lies to the west and north of St. John&#x27;s Harbour, and the rest of the city expands from the downtown to the north, south, east and west. The city covers a total of (larger than Montreal), but the majority of its area remains covered by undeveloped woods.

Coniferous trees such as black spruce, white spruce, and balsam fir dominate the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most abundant and Norway maple is common. Blue spruce, common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden are among the other non-native species grown.
===Climate===

St. John&#x27;s has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;)
 with smaller seasonal variation than normal for the latitude, which is due to Gulf Stream moderation.

Mean temperatures range from in February to in August, showing somewhat of a seasonal lag in the climate. The city is also one of the areas of the country most prone to tropical cyclone activity, as it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, where tropical storms (and sometimes hurricanes) travel from the United States. With an annual average of precipitation, the city is one of the wettest in Canada outside of coastal British Columbia. This is partly due to its propensity for tropical storm activity as well as moist, Atlantic air frequently blowing ashore and creating precipitation.

Of major Canadian cities, St. John&#x27;s is the foggiest (124 days) and windiest ( average speed). Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year-round. On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity. June is the driest month, averaging of precipitation. The wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with about of precipitation on average. This winter precipitation maximum is unusual for humid continental climates, which typically have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the Midwestern United States). Most heavy precipitation events in St. John&#x27;s are the product of intense mid-latitude storms from the Northeastern United States and New England states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds.

In winter, two or more types of precipitation (rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow) can fall from passage of a single storm. Snowfall is heavy, averaging approximately per winter season. However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types. Heavy snow can turn into heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation. Snow cover in St. John&#x27;s is variable, and especially early in the winter season, may be slow to develop, but can extend well into the spring months (March, April). The St. John&#x27;s area is subject to freezing rain events (called &quot;silver thaws&quot;), the worst of which paralysed the city in April 1984 and April 2017.

On 17 January 2020, St. John&#x27;s declared a state of emergency due to a snowstorm that brought an estimated —a one-day snowfall record for St. John&#x27;s—and hurricane force winds up to . The following day, the Canadian Army was called in to aid snow removal. The state of emergency ended eight days later.

The highest temperature ever recorded in St. John&#x27;s was on 14 August 1876. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 16 February 1875.

== Downtown architecture==

Downtown St. John&#x27;s architecture has a distinct style. Starting originally as a fishing outpost for European fishermen, St. John&#x27;s consisted mostly of the homes of fishermen, sheds, storage shacks, and wharves constructed out of wood. As the Industrial Revolution developed and new methods and materials for construction were introduced, and the cityscape changed as the city grew. The Great Fire of 1892 destroyed most of the downtown core, and most residential and other wood-frame buildings date from this period. The City&#x27;s earliest suburbs in the area now known as Georgestown were not touched by the fire. 

Built on hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, in St. John&#x27;s is typically painted in bright colours, hence the nickname Jelly Bean Row for downtown row housing. However, 
::downtown St. John&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t always as bright and colourful as it is today. The coal soot that blanketed St. John&#x27;s in much of the 19th and 20th centuries made light exterior paint colours impractical. Houses along downtown streets and lanes were mostly dark shades of green, red, brown, and grey. Bright colours were introduced in the 1970s when coal was no longer used. 
The city council implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings. These regulations have caused much controversy over the years. With the city experiencing an economic boom a lack of hotel rooms and office space has seen proposals put forward that do not meet the current height regulations. Heritage advocates argue the current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development.

To meet the need for more office space downtown, the city council amended heritage regulations, which originally restricted height to in the area of land on Water Street between Bishop&#x27;s Cove and Steer&#x27;s Cove, to create the &quot;Commercial Central Retail – West Zone&quot;. The new zone allows for higher buildings. A , 12-storey office building, which includes retail space and a parking garage, was the first building to be approved in this area.

==Neighbourhoods in St. John&#x27;s==

The city of St. John&#x27;s is made up of many neighbourhoods. Georgestown was the first suburb. The Goulds and Kilbride are former communities that have been amalgamated with St. John&#x27;s. The Battery is an outport within the city of St. John&#x27;s. Quidi Vidi is a similar, former fishing village on the outskirts of St John&#x27;s.

==Demographics==

==Economy==
St. John&#x27;s economy is connected both to its role as the provincial capital of Newfoundland and Labrador and to the ocean. The civil service which is supported by the federal, provincial and municipal governments has been the key to the expansion of the city&#x27;s labour force and to the stability of its economy, which supports a sizeable retail, service and business sector.
With the collapse of the cod fishing industry in Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1990s, the role of the ocean is now tied to what lies beneath it – oil and gas – as opposed to what swims in or travels across it. The city is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Eastern Canada and is one of 19 World Energy Cities. ExxonMobil Canada is headquartered in St. John&#x27;s and companies such as Chevron, Husky Energy, Suncor Energy and Statoil have major regional operations in the city. Three major offshore oil developments, Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose, are in production off the coast of the city and a fourth development, Hebron, discovered in 1981 and put online in 2017, is estimated to contain over 700 million barrels of producible hydrocarbons.

The economy has grown quickly. In 2010 and 2011, the metro area&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) led 27 other metropolitan areas in the country, according to the Conference Board of Canada, recording growth of 6.6% and 5.8% respectively. the city&#x27;s per capita GDP of $52,000 was the second highest out of all major Canadian cities. Economic forecasts suggested the city would continue its strong economic growth in the near future not only in the &quot;oceanic&quot; industries mentioned above, but also in tourism and new home construction as the population continues to grow. In May 2011, the city&#x27;s unemployment rate fell to 5.6%, the second lowest unemployment rate for a major city in Canada at the time.

St. John&#x27;s is also becoming known as an entrepreneurial city. In a 2009 report by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, &quot;Communities in Boom: Canada&#x27;s Top Entrepreneurial Cities&quot;, St. John&#x27;s was ranked the best major city in Atlantic Canada and 19th overall in Canada for providing a good environment for small business development.

=== Tourism ===

The team left after the 2004–05 season to Toronto due to the desire of its parent team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, to reduce travel costs and to have a tenant for its Ricoh Coliseum.

Shortly after, the Maple Leafs were replaced by the St. John&#x27;s Fog Devils of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). The team left St. John&#x27;s in 2008 after just three seasons due to a poor lease arrangement with the city over the use of Mary Brown&#x27;s Centre (formerly Mile One Centre) and poor attendance.

From 2011 until 2017, it was home to the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps in the AHL. The IceCaps operated under two separate franchises and affiliations during its time in St. John&#x27;s; the first owned by the Winnipeg Jets&#x27; True North Sports &amp; Entertainment and the second by the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; Molson family. Both franchises were relocated to be closer to their parent team.

In 2018, the ECHL approved an expansion team for St. John&#x27;s with the Newfoundland Growlers. The team became the ECHL affiliate of the Toronto Maple Leafs bringing the Leafs back to St. John&#x27;s for the first time since 2005. In their first season, they won the Kelly Cup as champions of the league. In April 2024, the Growlers ceased operations before the 2023–24 ECHL season concluded.

In December 2024, the new ownership group of the Acadie-Bathurst Titan of the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) relocated the franchise to St. John&#x27;s.

<text>The Gulf of St. Lawrence fringes the shores of the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, in Canada, plus the islands Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, possessions of France, in North America.

The Gulf of St. Lawrence connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence River.

== Geography ==
===Borders===
At Baie-Trinité, the Pointe-des-Monts Lighthouse, a National historic site of Canada, was built in 1829-1830 on a point that geographers throughout history, since as early as Samuel de Champlain (1567-1655), have classified as the demarcation point between the St. Lawrence River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

The Gulf of St. Lawrence is bounded on the north by the Labrador Peninsula and Quebec, to the east by Saint-Pierre and Newfoundland, to the south by the Nova Scotia peninsula and Cape Breton Island, and to the west by the Gaspé Peninsula, New Brunswick, and Quebec. As for significant islands the Gulf of St. Lawrence contains Anticosti Island, Prince Edward Island, Îles-de-la-Madeleine archipelago, Cape Breton Island, Saint Pierre Island, and Miquelon-Langlade.

Half of the ten provinces of Canada adjoin the Gulf: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec.

===Marine Weather===
In winter, large quantities of ice form in the St. Lawrence River. Ice formation begins in December between Montreal and Quebec City. The prevailing winds and currents push this ice towards the estuary, generally reaching east of Les Méchins around the end of December. Ice covers the entire gulf in January and February.

Ice aids in navigation, preventing the formation of waves and therefore spray, thus having the advantage of preventing the icing process of ships.

===Tributaries and nested bays===
Besides the St. Lawrence River itself, significant streams emptying into the Gulf of St. Lawrence include the Miramichi River, Natashquan River, Romaine River, Restigouche River, Margaree River, Humber River, Mingan River and others.

Branches of the Gulf include the Chaleur Bay, Fortune Bay, Miramichi Bay, St. George&#x27;s Bay, Bay St. George, Bay of Islands, and Northumberland Strait.

According to Commission of Toponymy Quebec, the St. Lawrence River becomes the gulf at Pointe des Monts on the Côte-Nord and Matane Bas-Saint-Laurent or Sainte-Anne-des-Monts La Haute-Gaspésie, the Estuary is upstream, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, much wider, downstream.

===Marine Mammals===
Large marine mammals travel in all the seas of the earth, the research and observations of these giants concern fishermen and shipping industry, exercise a fascination and a keen interest for laymen and, subjects of endless studies for scientists from Quebec, Canada and around the world.

Thirteen species of cetaceans inhabit the estuary and the gulf of the St. Lawrence River:

# &quot;Hyperoodon ampullatus&quot; (Northern Bottlenose Whale)
# &quot;Delphinapterus leucas&quot; (Beluga Whale)
# &quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot; (Sperm whale)
# &quot;Lagenorhynchus acutus&quot; (Atlantic white-sided dolphin)
# &quot;Lagenorhynchus albirostris&quot; (White-beaked dolphin)
# &quot;Orcinus orca&quot; (Killer Whale)
# &quot;Globicephala melas&quot; (Long-Finned Pilot Whale)
# &quot;Phocoena Phocoena&quot; (Harbour Porpoise)
# &quot;Eubalaena glacialis&quot; (North Atlantic Right Whale)
# &quot;Balaenoptera acutorostrata&quot; (Minke whale)
# &quot;Balaenoptera musculus&quot; (Blue whale)
# &quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot; (Humpback whale)
# &quot;Balaenoptera physalus&quot; (Fin whale)

=== Outlets ===
Around Anticosti Island and to flow into the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of the Gulf take the following straits:

* Jacques Cartier Strait, between the shore of Côte-Nord region and the North of Anticosti Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canadian sailing directions. ATL 110, St. Lawrence River, Cap Whittle/Cap Gaspé to Les Escoumins and Anticosti Island.&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Honguedo Strait, a wide passage between the Gaspésie peninsula and Anticosti Island.
*Strait of Belle Isle between Labrador and Newfoundland: between and wide and deep at its deepest.
*Cabot Strait, about 56 miles wide, is the entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence between Cape Ray, Newfoundland, and Cape North, the NE point of Cape Breton Island. 
*Strait of Canso is located between Cape Breton Island and mainland Nova Scotia, it originally served as an outlet 1.0 km (0.6 mi) wide and 60 m (200 ft) deep at its deepest. Due to the construction of the Canso Causeway across the strait in 1955, the roadway no longer allows exchange of water between the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean.

=== Limits ===
Since its appearance on maps, there has been no consensus on the demarcation of the St Lawrence River from the Gulf, nor whether it is hydrographically a gulf or an estuary.

According to Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2023, the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence planning area covers most of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence bioregion, an area with some of the warmest surface waters in Atlantic Canada during summer and the largest amount of sea ice during winter. The planning area is approximately 240,000 km².

According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the name of Gulf St. Lawrence in a hydrologic context is not accurate, a gulf has to be considered more as a sea bordering the North American continent than as simply a river mouth.

The International Hydrographic Organization 1953 defines it as follows:
:&quot;On the Northeast:&quot; A line running from Cape Bauld (North point of Kirpon Island, ) to the East extreme of Belle Isle and on to the Northeast Ledge (). Thence a line joining this ledge with the East extreme of Cape St. Charles (52°13&#x27;N) in Labrador.

:&quot;On the Southeast:&quot; A line from Cape Canso () to Red Point () in Cape Breton Island, through this Island to Cape Breton [] and on to Pointe Blanche () in the Island of St. Pierre, and thence to the southwest point of Morgan Island ().

:&quot;On the West:&quot; The meridian of 64°30&#x27;W from Pointe-Jaune () to Magpie (), but the whole of Anticosti Island is included in the Gulf.

=== Protected Areas and National Parks===
Western Honguedo Strait Coral Conservation Area, create following the signing of the Canada–Quebec Collaborative Agreement to Establish a Network of Marine Protected Areas in Quebec in March 2018.

St. Paul Island in Nova Scotia off the northeastern tip of Cape Breton Island, is known as the &quot;Graveyard of the Gulf&quot; because of its many shipwrecks. Access to this island is controlled by the Canadian Coast Guard.

In 1919 the first Migratory Bird Sanctuaries (MBS) in Canada were established under the Migratory Birds Convention Act on Bonaventure Island, on the Bird Rocks of the Magdalen Islands, and on the Percé Rock. These migratory bird sanctuaries are administered by the Canadian Wildlife Service.

The Federal Government of Canada manages 37 National Parks of Canada, overview of the parks touching the Gulf of St. Lawrence: Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, in Côte-Nord, Forillon National Park on the eastern tip of the Gaspé Peninsula, Prince Edward Island National Park on the northern shore of the island, Kouchibouguac National Park on the northeastern coast of New Brunswick, Cape Breton Highlands National Park on the northern tip of Cape Breton Island, Gros Morne National Park on the west coast of Newfoundland.

In Quebec, since March 31, 2024, the network of protected areas extends over 274,431 km2 and is established as follows:

*Continental environment (terrestrial and fresh water): 255,377 km2 or 16.89%;
*Marine and coastal environments: 18,991 km2 or 12.21% distributed as follows:
*Marine protected areas and territories set aside in the marine environment: 16,140 km2 or 10.39%;
*Portions of territories in marine and coastal environments associated with protected areas whose conservation objectives do not specifically target the marine environment (national parks, national park reserves of Quebec and Canada, migratory bird sanctuaries, planned aquatic reserves, reserves of projected biodiversity, areas of concentration of aquatic birds, etc.): 2,854 km2 or 1.84%;
*Plan Nord territory: 229,021 km2 or 19.19%.

The five provinces bordering the Gulf of St. Lawrence have several provincial parks with protected coasts.
=== Undersea Features ===
The Laurentian Channel is a feature of the floor of the Gulf that was formed during previous ice ages, when the Continental Shelf was eroded by the St. Lawrence River during the periods when the sea level plunged. The Laurentian Channel is about deep and about long from the Continental Shelf to the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. Deep waters with temperatures between enter the Gulf at the continental slope and are slowly advected up the channel by estuariane circulation. Over the 20th century, the bottom waters of the end of the channel (i.e. in the St. Lawrence estuary) have become hypoxic.

==Ports==
Almost all of Quebec&#x27;s ports are located along the St. Lawrence River seaway, from its source to its gulf, to the Atlantic Ocean. There are dozens and dozens of shelters, harbors, natural ports, large and small along the gulf up to the source of the St. Lawrence River, we can add village or individual wharf, without forgetting the large international maritime transport ports. In its annual report on maritime traffic in Canada, the Federal Bureau of Statistics gives detailed annual statistics for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023

Ports of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, on the Côte-Nord Shore: Blanc-Sablon, Harrington Harbor, Natashquan, Havre-Saint-Pierre, Mingan, Port-Menier (Anticosti Island), Cap-aux-Meules (Îles-de-la -Madeleine).

== History ==
The gulf has provided a historically important marine fishery for various First Nations that have lived on its shores for millennia and used its waters for transportation.

The first documented voyage by a European in its waters was by the French explorer Jacques Cartier in the year 1534. Cartier named the shores of the St. Lawrence River &quot;The Country of Canadas&quot;, after an indigenous word meaning &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot;, thus naming the world&#x27;s second largest country.

Basque whalers from Saint-Jean-de-Luz sailed into the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1530 and began whaling at Red Bay. They established their base on the Strait of Belle Isle and worked closely with the Iroquois in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In 1579 the English government closed all English ports to Spanish oil imports. As a result, a third of Basque whale oil could not be sold. Basque whaling collapsed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and never recovered.

<text>Hemolysis or haemolysis (), also known by several other names, is the rupturing (lysis) of red blood cells (erythrocytes) and the release of their contents (cytoplasm) into surrounding fluid (e.g. blood plasma). Hemolysis may occur in vivo or in vitro.

One cause of hemolysis is the action of hemolysins, toxins that are produced by certain pathogenic bacteria or fungi. Another cause is intense physical exercise. Hemolysins damage the red blood cell&#x27;s cytoplasmic membrane, causing lysis and eventually cell death.

==Etymology==
From hemo- + -lysis, from Ancient Greek (, &#x27;blood&#x27;) + , &#x27;loosening&#x27;).

==Inside the body==

Hemolysis inside the body can be caused by a large number of medical conditions, including some parasites (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Plasmodium&quot;), some autoimmune disorders (&quot;e.g.&quot;, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, drug-induced hemolytic anemia, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)), some genetic disorders (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Sickle-cell disease or G6PD deficiency), or blood with too low a solute concentration (hypotonic to cells).

Hemolysis can lead to hemoglobinemia due to hemoglobin released into the blood plasma, which plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and can lead to increased risk of infection due to its inhibitory effects on the innate immune system.

===Parasitic hemolysis===
Because the feeding process of the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites damages red blood cells, malaria is sometimes called &quot;parasitic hemolysis&quot; in medical literature.

===HELLP, pre-eclampsia, or eclampsia===
:See HELLP syndrome, Pre-eclampsia, and Eclampsia

===Hemolytic disease of the newborn===

Hemolytic disease of the newborn is an autoimmune disease resulting from the mother&#x27;s antibodies crossing the placenta to the fetus. This most often occurs when the mother has previously been exposed to blood antigens present on the fetus but foreign to her, through either a blood transfusion or a previous pregnancy.

===Hemolytic anemia===

Because &quot;in vivo&quot; hemolysis destroys red blood cells, in uncontrolled, chronic or severe cases it can lead to hemolytic anemia.

=== Hemolytic crisis===
A hemolytic crisis, or hyperhemolytic crisis, is characterized by an accelerated rate of red blood cell destruction leading to anemia, jaundice, and reticulocytosis. Hemolytic crises are a major concern with sickle-cell disease and G6PD deficiency.

===Toxic agent ingestion or poisoning===
&quot;Paxillus involutus&quot; ingestion can cause hemolysis.

=== Space hemolysis ===
Spaceflight can cause hemolysis.

===Intrinsic causes===

Hemolysis may result from intrinsic defects in the red blood cell itself:
* Defects of red blood cell membrane production (as in hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary elliptocytosis)
* Defects in hemoglobin production (as in thalassemia, sickle-cell disease and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia)
* Defective red cell metabolism (as in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and pyruvate kinase deficiency)
* Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), sometimes referred to as Marchiafava-Micheli syndrome, is a rare, acquired, potentially life-threatening disease of the blood characterized by complement-induced intravascular hemolytic anemia.

===Extrinsic causes===

Extrinsic hemolysis is caused by the red blood cell&#x27;s environment:
* Immune-mediated causes could include transient factors as in &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; infection (cold agglutinin disease) or permanent factors as in autoimmune diseases like autoimmune hemolytic anemia (itself more common in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia).
* Spur cell hemolytic anemia
* Any of the causes of hypersplenism (increased activity of the spleen), such as portal hypertension.
* Acquired hemolytic anemia is also encountered in burns and as a result of certain infections (e.g. malaria).
* Lead poisoning or poisoning by arsine or stibine causes non-immune hemolytic anemia.
* Runners can develop hemolytic anemia due to &quot;footstrike hemolysis&quot;, the destruction of red blood cells in feet at foot impact.
* Low-grade hemolytic anemia occurs in 70% of prosthetic heart valve recipients, and severe hemolytic anemia occurs in 3%.

===Intravascular hemolysis===
Intravascular hemolysis describes hemolysis that happens mainly inside the vasculature. As a result, the contents of the red blood cell are released into the general circulation, leading to hemoglobinemia and increasing the risk of ensuing hyperbilirubinemia.

Intravascular hemolysis may occur when red blood cells are targeted by autoantibodies, leading to complement fixation, or by damage by parasites such as &quot;Babesia&quot;. Additionally, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) can result in hemolysis of red blood cells. TMA is frequently observed in aHUS patients where clots form in the small vessels of the kidney resulting in damaged red blood cells as they attempt to pass through the restricted vessels.

===Extravascular hemolysis===

Extravascular hemolysis refers to hemolysis taking place in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. In this case little hemoglobin escapes into blood plasma. The macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system in these organs engulf and destroy structurally-defective red blood cells, or those with antibodies attached, and release unconjugated bilirubin into the blood plasma circulation. Typically, the spleen destroys mildly abnormal red blood cells or those coated with IgG-type antibodies, while severely abnormal red blood cells or those coated with IgM-type antibodies are destroyed in the circulation or in the liver.

If extravascular hemolysis is extensive, hemosiderin can be deposited in the spleen, bone marrow, kidney, liver, and other organs, resulting in hemosiderosis.

==Outside the body==

&quot;In vitro&quot; hemolysis can be caused by improper technique during collection of blood specimens, by the effects of mechanical processing of blood, or by bacterial action in cultured blood specimens.

===From specimen collection===
Most causes of &quot;in vitro&quot; hemolysis are related to specimen collection. Difficult collections, unsecure line connections, contamination, and incorrect needle size, as well as improper tube mixing and incorrectly filled tubes are all frequent causes of hemolysis. 

&quot;In vitro&quot; hemolysis during specimen collection can cause inaccurate laboratory test results by contaminating the surrounding plasma with the contents of hemolyzed red blood cells. For example, the concentration of potassium inside red blood cells is much higher than in the plasma and so an elevated potassium level is usually found in biochemistry tests of hemolyzed blood.

After the blood collection process, &quot;in vitro&quot; hemolysis can still occur in a sample due to external factors, such as prolonged storage, incorrect storage conditions and excessive physical forces by dropping or vigorously mixing the tube.

===From mechanical blood processing during surgery===
In some surgical procedures (especially some heart operations) where substantial blood loss is expected, machinery is used for intraoperative blood salvage. A centrifuge process takes blood from the patient, washes the red blood cells with normal saline, and returns them to the patient&#x27;s blood circulation. Hemolysis may occur if the centrifuge rotates too quickly (generally greater than 500 rpm)—essentially this is hemolysis occurring outside of the body. Increased hemolysis occurs with massive amounts of sudden blood loss, because the process of returning a patient&#x27;s cells must be done at a correspondingly higher speed to prevent hypotension, pH imbalance, and a number of other hemodynamic and blood level factors. Modeling of fluid flows to predict the likelihood of red cell membrane rupture in response to stress is an active area of research.

===From bacteria culture===
Visualizing the physical appearance of hemolysis in cultured blood samples may be used as a tool to determine the species of various Gram-positive bacteria infections (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus&quot;).

==Nomenclature==
Hemolysis is sometimes called hematolysis, erythrolysis, or erythrocytolysis. The words &quot;hemolysis&quot; () and &quot;hematolysis&quot; () both use combining forms conveying the idea of &quot;lysis of blood&quot; (&quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;). The words &quot;erythrolysis&quot; () and &quot;erythrocytolysis&quot; () both use combining forms conveying the idea of &quot;lysis of erythrocytes&quot; (&quot;&quot; ± &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;).

Red blood cells (erythrocytes) have a short lifespan (approximately 120 days), and old () cells are constantly removed and replaced with new ones via erythropoiesis. This breakdown/replacement process is called erythrocyte turnover. In this sense, erythrolysis or hemolysis is a normal process that happens continually. However, these terms are usually used to indicate that the lysis is pathological.

==Complications==
Pulmonary hypertension has been gaining recognition as a complication of chronic hereditary and acquired hemolysis. Free hemoglobin released during hemolysis inactivates the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). Hemolysis also releases arginase that depletes L-arginine, the substrate needed for NO synthesis. This reduces NO-dependent vasodilation and induces platelet activation, thrombin generation, procoagulant factors and tissue factor activation, contributing to the formation of thrombosis. This can lead to esophageal spasm and dysphagia, abdominal pain, erectile dysfunction, systemic hypertension, decreased organ perfusion, promotion of inflammation and coagulation, and thrombosis.

Chronic hemolysis may also lead to endothelial dysfunction, heightened endothelin-1-mediated responses and vasculopathy. The release of heme leads to the production of bilirubin and depletion of plasma proteins, such as albumin, haptoglobin, and hemopexin, which may lead to jaundice. It may also lead to increased levels of the heme breakdown product stercobilin in the stool.

Splenectomy of those with hemolytic disorders appears to increase risk of developing pulmonary thrombosis.

Complications may also arise from the increased workload for the kidney as it secretes erythropoietin to stimulate the bone marrow to produce more reticulocytes (red blood cell precursors) to compensate for the loss of red blood cells due to hemolysis.

<doc id="70592" wikidata="Q233596" url="?curid=70592" title="Ginger Lynn">
<text>Ginger Lynn Allen (born December 14, 1962) is an American pornographic actress and model who was a premier adult-entertainment star of the 1980s. She also had minor roles in various B movies. &quot;Adult Video News&quot; ranked her at #7 of the 50 greatest porn stars of all time in 2002. After ending her pornography career, she began using her full name and found work in a variety of B-movies. She returned to the adult industry and appeared in pornographic movies throughout the 2000s. Allen is a member of AVN, NightMoves, XRCO, and Urban X Halls of Fame.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Rockford, Illinois, Allen moved to California in 1982 to become her grandfather&#x27;s caregiver following his heart attack. After he died, she had her &quot;first nice boyfriend&quot; move in with her. Allen, the breadwinner of the two, felt obligated to find a lucrative occupation. When she answered an advertisement from the World Modeling Agency in September 1983, she immediately signed a contract with that agency and did pictorials for &quot;Cheri&quot;, &quot;Club&quot;, &quot;Hustler&quot;, and &quot;Penthouse&quot;, which brought her to the attention of the adult entertainment industry.

==Career==
===Adult industry===
Allen began as a nude model and then began performing in hardcore sex films as Ginger Lynn by December 1983. Her first pornographic movie role was in &quot;Surrender in Paradise&quot;, in which she starred with Jerry Butler. Allen&#x27;s &quot;girl next door&quot; good looks led to a quick rise in her popularity and eventually she became one of the most popular female performers in adult-entertainment history. She had her own line of videos through Vivid Entertainment with the director Bruce Seven. Allen received the Best New Starlet award in 1985 and is an inductee to the X-Rated Critics Organization (XRCO) and &quot;Adult Video News&quot; (AVN) halls of fame. Allen signed a contract with Vivid Entertainment founder, Steven Hirsch, making her the first &#x27;Vivid Girl&#x27; and beating out the then-underaged Traci Lords. She was later called to testify on Lords&#x27; behalf against porn producers; she refused, and according to her, was then targeted by the Internal Revenue Service for falsification of a tax return.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins 3/8/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream===
In February 1986, Allen left the adult industry in order to establish herself in mainstream films by using her full name. That same year, she contributed vocals to &quot;Fantasy World&quot;, a single released by the music group &quot;Ginger&quot;. Allen appeared in several non-adult films, television shows and interactive movie segments of the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; computer games. She started her career in mainstream features with a small part in the western &quot;Young Guns II&quot;, which co-starred her future boyfriend Charlie Sheen&#x27;s brother, Emilio Estevez.

Allen was the subject of an episode of the documentary series E! &quot;True Hollywood Story&quot; in 2002. Allen appeared in another episode about her relationship with actor Charlie Sheen in 2010.

In December 2005, she appeared in &quot;American Pie Presents: Band Camp&quot; (2005) playing the supporting role of Nurse Sanders. In the same year, she portrayed Fanny in Rob Zombie&#x27;s thriller film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot; and later starred as Cherry Bomb in Zombie&#x27;s slasher film &quot;31&quot;.

===Adult return===

Allen returned to the adult-entertainment industry in 1999 for three movies: &quot;Torn&quot; (1999), &quot;White Lightning&quot; (2000), and &quot;New Wave Hookers 6&quot; (2000). In March 2006, she became a host of Playboy Radio&#x27;s Sirius Satellite Radio show, &quot;Night Calls Radio&quot;, with former adult-entertainment performer Christy Canyon. In June 2007, Allen performed for two of Kink.com&#x27;s hardcore websites, &quot;Ultimate Surrender&quot; and &quot;Sex and Submission&quot;.

==Personal life==

Allen had a relationship with Charlie Sheen from 1990 to 1992 and accompanied him through drug rehabilitation. Despite consistent claims that Sheen has been physically abusive towards women, Lynn has said she never experienced abuse: &quot;Not one time did he raise his voice. No violence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins 3/7/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She had a relationship with actor George Clooney.

In 1991, Lynn served four and a half months in prison for tax evasion. In 1996, Lynn had a son with porn producer Steve Hirsch.

<text>The May Fourth Movement was a Chinese cultural and anti-imperialist political movement which grew out of student protests in Beijing on May 4, 1919. Students gathered in front of Tiananmen to protest the Chinese government&#x27;s weak response to the Treaty of Versailles decision to allow the Empire of Japan to retain territories in Shandong that had been surrendered by the German Empire after the Siege of Tsingtao in 1914. The demonstrations sparked nation-wide protests and spurred an upsurge in Chinese nationalism, a shift towards political mobilization away from cultural activities, and a move towards a populist base, away from traditional intellectual and political elites.

The May Fourth demonstrations marked a turning point in a broader anti-traditional New Culture Movement (1915–1921) that sought to replace traditional Confucian values and was itself a continuation of late Qing reforms. Even after 1919, these educated &quot;new youths&quot; still defined their role with a traditional model in which the educated elite took responsibility for both cultural and political affairs. They opposed traditional culture but looked abroad for cosmopolitan inspiration in the name of nationalism and were an overwhelmingly urban movement that espoused populism in an overwhelmingly rural country. Many political and social leaders of the next five decades emerged at this time, including those of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

== Background ==

Oxford University historian Rana Mitter observed that the &quot;atmosphere and political mood that emerged around 1919 are at the center of a set of ideas that has shaped China&#x27;s momentous twentieth century.&quot; The Qing dynasty had disintegrated in 1911, marking the end of thousands of years of imperial rule, and ushered a new era in which political power nominally rested with the people, but Confucianism still had a profound influence on social and political relations. After the death of President Yuan Shikai in 1916, China became dominated by warlords who were concerned with building political power and rival regional armies. The government in Beijing could do little to counter foreign influence and control. Chinese Premier Duan Qirui&#x27;s signing of the secret Sino-Japanese Joint Defence Agreement in 1918 enraged the Chinese public when it was leaked to the press, and sparked a student protest movement that laid the groundwork for the May Fourth Movement. The March 1st Movement in Korea in 1919, the Russian Revolution of 1917, continued defeats by foreign powers and the presence of spheres of influence further inflamed Chinese nationalism among the emerging middle class and cultural leaders.

Leaders of the New Culture Movement blamed traditional Confucian values for the political weakness of the nation. Chinese nationalists called for a rejection of traditional values and the adoption of Western ideals of &quot;Mr. Science&quot; () and &quot;Mr. Democracy&quot; () in place of &quot;Mr. Confucius&quot; in order to strengthen the new nation. These iconoclastic and anti-traditional views and programs have influenced China&#x27;s politics and culture to the present day.

=== Twenty-One Demands ===

The twenty-one demands were a set of proposals presented by the Ōkuma Shigenobu government to the Yuan Shikai administration in hopes of expanding Japanese affairs in China. The demands consisted of a variety of economic, territorial and power-hungry provisions. An important component of these demands were in regards to Chinese territory. These included intentions for expanding Japanese interests in southern Manchuria, eastern Mongolia, in addition to the confirmation of Japan&#x27;s seizure of German ports in China&#x27;s Shandong province.

In early 1915, Japan&#x27;s submission of the twenty-one demands were revealed to the Chinese public, causing an increase in political tension and frustration towards Japan. In light of these revelations, the Chinese press became very critical towards Japan, and Chinese citizens&#x27; views of Japan soured. The twenty-one demands ultimately added fuel to the rising tensions between the two countries, playing an important role in triggering the impending May Fourth Movement.

=== Shandong Problem ===

China had entered World War I on the side of the Triple Entente in 1917. Although that year, 140,000 Chinese laborers were sent to the Western Front as a part of the Chinese Labor Corps, the Treaty of Versailles ratified in April 1919 awarded rights to the German territories in Shandong to Japan. The representatives of the Chinese government put forth the following requests:
# Abolition of all privileges of foreign powers in China, such as extraterritoriality
# Cancelling of the Twenty-One Demands
# Return to China of the territory and rights of Shandong, which Japan had taken from Germany during World War I.
The Western allies dominated the meeting at Versailles, and paid little heed to Chinese demands. The European delegations, led by French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, were primarily interested in punishing Germany. Although the American delegation promoted Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points and the ideals of self-determination, they were unable to advance these ideals in the face of stubborn resistance by David Lloyd George and Clemenceau. American advocacy of self-determination at the League of Nations was attractive to Chinese intellectuals, but their failure to follow through was seen as a betrayal. This failure of diplomacy at the Paris Peace Conference created what became known as the &quot;Shandong Problem&quot;.

== Protests ==
=== May 4, 1919 ===
On the morning of May 4, 1919, student representatives from thirteen different local universities met in Beijing and drafted five resolutions:
# To oppose the granting of Shandong to the Japanese under former German concessions.
# To draw and increase awareness of China&#x27;s precarious position to the masses in China.
# To recommend a large-scale gathering in Beijing.
# To promote the creation of a Beijing student union.
# To hold a demonstration that afternoon in protest to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.
On the afternoon of May 4, over 4,000 students of Yenching University, Peking University and other schools marched from many points to gather in front of Tiananmen. They shouted such slogans as &quot;struggle for the sovereignty externally, get rid of the national traitors at home&quot;, &quot;Give Qingdao back to us!&quot;, &quot;do away with the Twenty-One Demands&quot;, and &quot;don&#x27;t sign the Versailles Treaty&quot;.

Protestors voiced their anger at the Allied betrayal of China, denounced the government&#x27;s spineless inability to protect Chinese interests, and called for a boycott of Japanese products. Demonstrators insisted on the resignation of three Chinese officials they accused of being collaborators with the Japanese. After burning the residences of these officials and beating some of their servants, student protesters were arrested, jailed, and severely beaten.

=== Participants ===

On May 4, 1919, a group of Chinese students began protesting the contents of the Paris Peace Conference. Under the pressure, the Chinese delegation refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles. The original participants of the May Fourth Movement were students in Paris and Beijing, who joined forces to strike and take to the streets to express their dissatisfaction with the government. Some advanced students in Shanghai and Guangzhou joined the protest movement as it progressed, gradually forming a wave of mass student strikes across China. In June 1919, the Beijing government carried out the &quot;June 3&quot; arrests, in which nearly 1,000 students were arrested. However, this did not suppress the patriotic student movement, instead further angering the Chinese public and increasing revolutionary sentiment. Workers and businessmen across the country went on strike in support of the students&#x27; movement, marking the entrance of the Chinese working class into the political arena.

With the emergence of working-class support, the May Fourth Movement developed to a new stage. The center of the movement shifted from Beijing to Shanghai, and the working class replaced students as the main force of the movement. The Shanghai working class staged a strike of an unprecedented scale. The growing scale of the national strike and the increasing number of its participants led to a paralysis of the country&#x27;s economic life and posed a serious threat to the government in Beijing. The working class took the place of the students to stand up and resist. The support for this movement throughout the country reflected the enthusiasm for nationalism and national rejuvenation, which was also the foundation for the development and expansion of the May Fourth Movement. Benjamin I. Schwartz added, &quot;Nationalism which was, of course, a dominant passion of the May Fourth experience was not so much a separate ideology as a common disposition.&quot;

=== Expansion ===
On May 5, students in Beijing as a whole went on strike and in the larger cities across China, students, patriotic merchants, and workers joined protests. The demonstrators skillfully appealed to the newspapers and sent representatives to carry the word across the country. On the morning of May 6, students from Shanghai gathered at Fudan University in response to the events in Beijing. By the evening, meetings and special committees were held at various campuses in Shanghai, and telegrams were sent to the Beijing government in the name of the 33 representatives of different campuses in Shanghai to express their protest. Over the next few days, the movement grew in size. Students in Shanghai began striking at the end of May. During this time, disagreements arose within the protesters about the intensity of the protests, but the protests as a whole were seen to be intensifying.

On June 3, police in Beijing arrested a large number of students. To express their disapproval to it, businessmen and workers in Shanghai joined the strike. The center of the movement shifted from Beijing to Shanghai. Chancellors from thirteen universities arranged for the release of student prisoners, and Cai Yuanpei, the principal of Peking University resigned in protest. Although at this point the event was defined as a multi-class protest action, overall it was still a student-led movement.

Newspapers, magazines, citizen societies, and chambers of commerce offered support for the students. Merchants threatened to withhold tax payments if China&#x27;s government remained obstinate. In Shanghai, a general strike of merchants and workers nearly devastated the entire Chinese economy. On June 12, the general strike ended because under intense public pressure, the Beijing government dismissed Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang and Lu Zongyu that had been accused of being collaborators with the Japanese. Nevertheless, students continued to express their protest against the content of the Versailles Peace Treaty by organizing rallies and other events at that time, and organized the National Student Union. Finally, Chinese representatives in Paris refused to sign the Versailles Treaty: the May Fourth Movement won an initial victory which was primarily symbolic, since Japan for the moment retained control of the Shandong Peninsula and the islands in the Pacific. Even the partial success of the movement exhibited the ability of China&#x27;s social classes across the country to successfully collaborate given proper motivation and leadership.

== Significance ==
Scholars rank the New Culture and May Fourth Movements as significant turning points, as David Der-wei Wang said, &quot;it was the turning point in China&#x27;s search for literary modernity&quot;, along with the abolition of the civil service system in 1905 and the overthrow of the monarchy in 1911. The challenge to traditional Chinese values, however, was also met with strong opposition, especially from parts of the Kuomintang. From their perspective, the movement destroyed the positive elements of Chinese tradition and placed a heavy emphasis on direct political actions and radical attitudes, characteristics associated with the emerging Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Two of the CCP&#x27;s founding members, Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu, were leaders of the movement. The CCP viewed it more favorably, although remaining suspicious of the early phase which emphasized the role of enlightened intellectuals, not revolution. Li and Chen were the most influential promoters of Marxism in China during the May Fourth period. In its broader sense, the May Fourth Movement led to the establishment of radical intellectuals who went on to mobilize peasants and workers into the CCP and gain the organizational strength that would solidify the success of the Chinese Communist Revolution.

During the May Fourth Movement, the group of intellectuals with communist ideas grew steadily, such as Chen Tanqiu, Zhou Enlai, Chen Duxiu, and others, who gradually appreciated Marxism&#x27;s power. This promoted the sinicization of Marxism and provided a basis for the birth of the CCP and socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The legacy of the May Fourth Movement is embraced both by the CCP and its critics, who express different understandings of the movement and its importance.

Kuomintang members such as Luo Jialun, Shao Lizi and Duan Xipeng played an active role in the Movement, and some Kuomintang leaders claimed that their party and its founder Sun Yat-sen were active in leading the movement. However, Kuomintang influence on the Movement was minimal. In British Malaya, May Fourth-influenced riots in Penang and Singapore involving Kuomintang teachers and sympathetic students led the British to pass the Registration of Schools Ordinance, an attempt to remove Kuomintang influence from local education. From 1922, the British also instituted a ban on the Kuomintang itself.

=== Birth of Chinese communism ===

For many years, the orthodox view in the People&#x27;s Republic of China was that after the demonstrations of 1919 and their subsequent suppression, the discussion of possible policy changes became more and more politically realistic. Influential leaders such as Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao shifted to the left and became founders of the CCP in 1921, while other intellectuals became more sympathetic. Originally voluntarist or nihilist figures like Li Shicen and Zhu Qianzhi made similar turns to the left as the 1920s saw China become increasingly turbulent. In 1939, Mao Zedong claimed that the May Fourth Movement was a stage leading toward the fulfillment of the Chinese Communist Revolution:
Paul French argues that the only victor of the Treaty of Versailles in China was communism, as rising public anger led directly to the formation of the CCP. The Treaty also led to Japan pursuing its conquests with greater boldness, which Wellington Koo had predicted in 1919 would lead to the outbreak of war between China and Japan.
Western-style liberal democracy had previously had a degree of traction among Chinese intellectuals. Still, after Versailles, which was viewed as a betrayal of China&#x27;s interests, it lost much of its attractiveness. Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points, despite being rooted in moralism, were seen as Western-centric and hypocritical. Many Chinese intellectuals believed that the United States had done little to convince the other nations to adhere to the Fourteen Points and observed that the United States had declined to join the League of Nations. As a result, they turned away from the Western liberal democratic model. With the October Revolution in Russia in 1917, Marxism began to take hold in Chinese intellectual thought, particularly among those already on the Left. Chinese intellectuals such as Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao began serious study of Marxist doctrine.

=== Cultural ===
The May Fourth Movement focused on opposing Confucian culture and promoting a new culture. As a continuation of the New Culture movement, the May Fourth Movement greatly influenced the cultural field. The slogans of &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;science&quot; advocated in the New Culture Movement were designed to attack the old culture and promote the new culture. This purpose can be summed up in a sentence from David Wang: &quot;It was the turning point in China&#x27;s search for literary modernity.&quot; As historian Wang Gungwu notes, the May Fourth Movement became subsequently identified as the predecessor and inspiration for the later Cultural Revolution.

Participants at the time, such as Hu Shih, referred to this era as the &quot;Chinese Renaissance&quot;, because there was an intense focus on science and experimentation. In Chinese literature, the May Fourth Movement is regarded as the watershed after which the modern Chinese literature began and the use of written vernacular Chinese gained currency over Literary Chinese, eventually replacing it in formal works. Intellectuals were driven toward expressing themselves using the spoken tongue under the slogan , although the change was gradual: Hu had already argued for the use of the modern vernacular language in literature in his 1917 essay &quot;Preliminary discussion on literary reform&quot;.

In 1917, Chen Hengzhe published the short story &quot;One Day&quot; () in an overseas student quarterly ()—a year before the publication of Lu Xun&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; and &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot; (not published until 1921), which has often been incorrectly credited as the first vernacular Chinese fiction.

More ordinary people also began to try to get in touch with new cultures and learn from foreign cultures. Joseph Chen said: &quot;This intellectual ferment had already had an effect in altering the outlook of China&#x27;s new youth.&quot; After the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese modern female literature developed a literature with modern humanistic spirit, taking women as the subject of experience, thinking, aesthetics, and speech.

Instead of the formerly euphemistic language for sex, May Fourth reformers used the broader, more explicit term &quot;xing&quot;.

In honor of the May Fourth Movement, May 4 is now celebrated as Youth Day in China and as Literary Day in Taiwan.

The domination of Confucian ideologies shaped gender inequalities in Chinese culture, labeling and treating women as second-class citizens. The May Fourth Movement played a crucial role in women&#x27;s emancipation in China, representing a social and cultural shift toward societal transformation.

Women in the May Fourth Movement were often restricted to indoor speeches and debates, lacking the same freedom of movement as their male counterparts. Although most activists and protesters were male, male intellectuals believed women&#x27;s liberation was essential for a stronger and unified China. They argued that Confucian family structures hindered China&#x27;s development. Stating that &quot;Women&#x27;s liberation had to be achieved to save China from disarray and humiliation.&quot; Many supported the movement as they believed that women&#x27;s emancipation was essential for a modern China. They saw it as intertwined with nationalism and new democratic values driven by the anti-imperialist movement.

=== Economic ===
Anger against Japan led many elements of society to join students in a movement to boycott Japanese products. Many hoped that when Japanese products were suppressed, China&#x27;s national industry would benefit. However, the strike in Shanghai that occurred in June damaged the economy. One of the main reasons was that shop owners were not willing to open their shops during the strike, despite the use of police force.

==Criticism and resistance==
Many intellectuals at the time opposed the anti-traditional message, some felt it did not go far enough, and many political figures ignored it. In the late twentieth century, voices more strongly questioned the premise that Chinese traditional culture had to be destroyed rather than developed. 

Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek, as a Confucian and a nationalist, was against the iconoclasm of the May Fourth Movement. As an anti-imperialist, he was skeptical of Western culture. He criticized these May Fourth intellectuals for corrupting the morals of youth. When the Nationalist party came to power under Chiang&#x27;s rule, it carried out the opposite agenda. The New Life Movement promoted Confucianism, and the Kuomintang purged China&#x27;s education system of western ideas, introducing Confucianism into the curriculum. Textbooks, exams, degrees, and educational instructors were all controlled by the state, as were all universities.

Some conservative philosophers and intellectuals opposed any change, but many more accepted or welcomed the challenge from the West but wanted to base new systems on Chinese values, not imported ones. These figures included Liang Shuming, Liu Shipei, Tao Xisheng, Xiong Shili, Zhang Binglin and Lu Xun&#x27;s brother, Zhou Zuoren. In later years, others developed critiques, including figures as diverse as Lin Yutang, Ch&#x27;ien Mu, Xu Fuguan, and Yu Ying-shih. Li Changzhi believed that the May Fourth Movement copied foreign culture and lost the essence of its own culture. (Ta Kung Pao, 1942). This is consistent with what Vera Schwarcz has said: &quot;Critically-minded intellectuals were accused of eroding national self-confidence, or more simply, of not being Chinese enough.&quot;

Another view was that &quot;this limited May Fourth individualist enlightenment did not lead the individual against the collective of the nation-state, as full-scale, modern Western individualism would potentially do.&quot;

Chinese Muslims ignored the May Fourth movement by continuing to teach Classical Chinese and literature with the Qur&#x27;an and Arabic along with officially mandated contemporary subjects at the &quot;Normal Islamic School of Wanxian&quot;. Ha Decheng did a Classical Chinese translation of the Quran. Arabic, vernacular Chinese, Classical Chinese and the Qur&#x27;an were taught in Ningxia Islamic schools funded by Muslim General Ma Fuxiang.

== Neotraditionalism versus Western thought ==
Although the May Fourth Movement attack on traditional Chinese culture was largely successful, opponents still argued that China&#x27;s traditions and values should be the fundamental foundations of the nation. These opponents of Western civilization formed three neotraditional schools of thought: national essence, national character, and modern relevance of Confucianism. Each school of thought denounced the western values of individualism, materialism and utilitarianism as inadequate avenues for the development of China. Each school held to specific objectives. The &quot;national essence&quot; school sought to discover aspects of traditional culture that could potentially serve the national development of China. Such traditional aspects consisted of various philosophical and religious practices that emerged parallel with Confucianism. Most particularly, China imported Buddhism during antiquity from India. Under the &quot;national character&quot; school, advocates promoted the traditional family system, the primary target of the May Fourth Movement. In this school, reformers viewed Westerners as shells without morals. Finally, the modern relevance of Confucianism was centered on the notion that Confucian values were better than Western ones. In response to western culture&#x27;s primary concentration on rational analysis, China&#x27;s neo-traditionalists argued that this was misguided, especially in the practical, changing milieu of the world. Most importantly, these three neo-traditionalist thoughts did not consider the individual, which was the main theme of the May Fourth Movement.

<text>Suze Randall (born 18 May 1946) is an English model, photographer, and pornographer. After giving up modelling she devoted her time to erotic photography and became the first woman to shoot &quot;Page 3&quot; for &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper. She was the first female staff photographer for both &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Hustler&quot;. Randall is one of the early female pornographic film directors; she made &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; in 1980. She is the president of adult content website Suze Network.

==Life and work==
Working first as a nurse and then as a fashion model in the early 1970s, Randall gained attention for erotic photographs she took of her fellow model friends. In 1972, she played an au pair in Éric Rohmer&#x27;s film &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot;. She gave up modelling and devoted her time to erotic photography becoming the first female to shoot &quot;Page 3&quot; for &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper. After working for years in top adult magazines like &quot;Penthouse&quot; and &quot;Playboy,&quot; she now continues her career as a freelance photographer. In recent years, her work has included bondage imagery.

Her breakthrough came when she spotted the pinup model Lillian Müller and photographed her for &quot;Playboy&quot;. Müller was chosen as Playmate of the Month in August 1975 and subsequently Playmate of the Year in 1976. In a pictorial in &quot;Playboy&#x27;s&quot; May 1976 issue, Randall was both photographer and model. She went on to shoot a much more explicit self-portrait in a June 1977 &quot;Hustler&quot; pictorial.

Randall was staff photographer from 1975 until 1977 for &quot;Playboy&quot; under the supervision of the magazine&#x27;s West Coast editor, Marilyn Grabowski, and from 1977 until 1979 staff photographer for &quot;Hustler&quot;. Later, she provided &quot;Penthouse Pet&quot; feature photo layouts.

Randall has shot the British Lamb&#x27;s Navy Rum calendar, has done album covers for recording artists such as Revenge and Robert Palmer, as well as a music video for Capitol Records.

==Personal life==
In the 1970s, Randall married writer Humphry Knipe, who helped write her biographical book &quot;Suze&quot; (1977), wrote and directed several of her films as Victor Nye, and managed Suze Randall Productions websites. They had three children together, including erotic photographer Holly Randall (born 1978). Knipe died in 2023, more than fifty years after he and Randall became a couple.

<text>Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, (1 June 156324 May 1612) was an English statesman noted for his direction of the government during the Union of the Crowns, as Tudor England gave way to Stuart rule (1603). Lord Salisbury served as the Secretary of State of England (1596–1612) and Lord High Treasurer (1608–1612), succeeding his father as Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s Lord Privy Seal and remaining in power during the first nine years of King James I&#x27;s reign until his own death.

The principal discoverer of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, Robert Cecil remains a controversial historic figure as it is still debated at what point he first learned of the plot and to what extent he acted as an &quot;agent provocateur&quot;.

Cecil (created Earl of Salisbury in 1605) was the younger son of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley by his second wife, Mildred Cooke, eldest daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke of Gidea, Essex. His elder half-brother was Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter, and philosopher Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St Albans, was his first cousin.

Robert Cecil was tall, had scoliosis, and was hunchbacked. Living in an age which attached much importance to physical beauty in both sexes, he endured much ridicule as a result: Queen Elizabeth I called him &quot;my pygmy&quot;, and King James I nicknamed him &quot;my little beagle&quot;. Nonetheless, his father recognised that it was Robert rather than his half-brother Thomas who had inherited his own political genius.

Cecil attended St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in the 1580s, but did not take a degree. He also attended &quot;disputations&quot; at the Sorbonne.

In 1589, Cecil married Elizabeth Brooke, the daughter of William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham by his second wife, Frances Newton. Their son, William Cecil, was born in Westminster on 28 March 1591, and baptised in St Clement Danes on 11 April. He was followed by a daughter, Lady Frances Cecil (1593–1644). Elizabeth died in 1597, leaving Cecil with two small children. Her brothers Henry, 11th Baron Cobham, and George Brooke were arrested by Cecil for their involvement in the Bye and Main Plots; George, her younger brother, was executed at Winchester on 5 December 1603 for high treason.

In 1608, Frances Cecil caught the eye of King James I&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth and she made Sir John Harington write to Salisbury to invite her to join her household. She married the 5th Earl of Cumberland and had one daughter but no sons.

==Secretary of State==

===Under Elizabeth===
In 1584, Cecil sat for the first time in the House of Commons, representing his birthplace, the borough of Westminster, and was re-elected in 1586. He was a back bencher, never making a speech until 1593, after having been appointed a Privy Councillor. In 1588, he accompanied Lord Derby in his mission to the Netherlands to negotiate peace with Spain. He was elected for Hertfordshire in 1589, 1593, 1597, and 1601, was made a Privy Counsellor in 1591 and was leader of the Council by 1597.

Following the death of Sir Francis Walsingham in 1590, Burghley acted as Secretary of State, while Cecil took on an increasingly heavy work-load. He was also knighted and subsequently appointed to the Privy Council in 1591, and began to act as Secretary of State in 1589, although his formal appointment came later. He participated in the social life of the royal court, on 15 September 1595 he went hawking with the queen and they caught three partridges, which they gave to Elizabeth Wolley.

In 1597, he was made Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and in February 1598 dispatched on a mission to Henry IV of France, to prevent the impending alliance between that country and Spain. Three ambassadors, Cecil, John Herbert, and Thomas Wilkes left from Dover, but Wilkes died soon after arrival at Rouen. Cecil and Herbert lodged at a house of the Duke of Montpensier in Paris, and subsequently travelled south to meet the French king at Angers in March. They had their final audiences with the king at Nantes and the Duke de Bouillon gave Cecil a locket with the king&#x27;s portrait. They sailed home to Portsmouth from Ouistreham, a port near Caen, in the &quot;Adventure&quot; commanded by Sir Alexander Clifford. Cecil became the leading minister after the death of his father in August 1598, serving both Queen Elizabeth and King James as Secretary of State.

Cecil fell into dispute with the 2nd Earl of Essex, and only prevailed at Court upon the latter&#x27;s poor campaign against the Irish rebels during the Nine Years War in 1599. He was then in a position to orchestrate the smooth succession of King James. Lord Essex&#x27;s unsuccessful rebellion in 1601, which resulted in his final downfall and death, was largely aimed at Sir Robert Cecil, as he then was, who was to be removed from power and impeached. Whether Essex intended that Cecil should actually die is unclear.

It is to Cecil&#x27;s credit that the Queen, largely at his urging, treated the rebels with a degree of mercy, which was unusual in that age. Essex himself and four of his closest allies were executed, but the great majority of his followers were spared: even Essex&#x27;s denunciation of his sister Penelope, as the ringleader of the rebellion, was tactfully ignored. This clemency did him no good in the eyes of the public, who had loved Essex and mourned him deeply. Cecil, who had never been very popular, now became a much-hated figure. In ballads like &quot;Essex&#x27;s Last Good Night&quot;, Cecil was viciously attacked.

Cecil was extensively involved in matters of state security. As the son of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s principal minister and a protégé of Francis Walsingham (Elizabeth&#x27;s principal spymaster), he was trained by them in spy-craft as a matter of course. The &quot;Rainbow Portrait&quot; of Queen Elizabeth at Hatfield, decorated with eyes and ears, may relate to this role.

Cecil, like his father, greatly admired the Queen, whom he famously described as being &quot;more than a man, but less than a woman&quot;. Despite his careful preparations for the succession, he clearly regarded the Queen&#x27;s death as a misfortune to be postponed as long as possible. During her last illness, when Elizabeth would sit motionless on cushions for hours on end, Cecil boldly told her that she must go to bed. Elizabeth roused herself one last time to snap at him: &quot;Little man, little man, &#x27;Must&#x27; is not a word to use to princes. Your father were he here durst never speak to me so&quot;; but she added wryly &quot;Ah, but ye know that I must die, and it makes you presumptuous&quot;.

===Under James I===
Sir Robert Cecil now promoted James as successor to Elizabeth. Around 1600, he began a secret correspondence with James in Scotland, to persuade James that he favoured his claims to the English throne. An understanding was now effected by which Cecil was able to assure James of his succession, ensure his own power and predominance in the new reign against Sir Walter Raleigh and other competitors, and secure the tranquillity of the last years of Elizabeth. Cecil demanded as conditions that James stop his attempts to obtain parliamentary recognition of his title, that absolute respect should be paid to the queen&#x27;s feelings, and that the communications should remain a secret.

James took the throne without opposition, and the new monarch expressed his gratitude by elevating Cecil to the peerage. Cecil also served as both the third chancellor of the University of Dublin, and chancellor of the University of Cambridge, between 1601 and 1612.

In 1603, his brothers-in-law, Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham and George Brooke, along with Sir Walter Raleigh, were implicated in both the Bye Plot and the Main Plot, an attempt to remove King James I from the throne and replace him with his first cousin, Lady Arbella Stuart. Cecil was one of the judges who tried them for treason: at Raleigh&#x27;s trial, Cecil was the only judge who appeared to have some doubts about his guilt (which is still a matter of debate, although the prevailing view now is that Raleigh was involved in the Plot to some extent). Though they were found guilty and sentenced to death, both Cobham and Raleigh were eventually reprieved; this may have been due in part to Cecil&#x27;s pleas for mercy, although the King kept his intentions a secret until the last minute.

King James I raised Robert Cecil to the peerage, on 20 August 1603, as Baron Cecil of Essendon in the County of Rutland. Baron Cecil then led the English delegation at the Treaty of London that brought peace between Spain and England after a long war. Between 1603 and 1604 difficult negotiations with the Spanish delegation took place, but through Cecil&#x27;s determined statesmanship the treaty bought an &quot;honourable and advantageous&quot; peace for England. This was a personal triumph for Cecil which reflected well on James who wanted to be styled as a European peacemaker between the Protestants and the Catholics. Cecil accepted a pension of £1,000 that year, which was raised the following year to £1,500. The King also rewarded Cecil further creating him Viscount Cranborne soon after the treaty had been signed and then Earl of Salisbury the following year. Cecil was appointed to the Order of the Garter as its 401st Knight in 1606. In 1607, James appointed him as Lord Treasurer, succeeding Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset. As a result, the whole conduct of public affairs was solely in his hands, although the king often interfered.

Although King James would often speak disparagingly of Cecil as &quot;my little beagle&quot; or &quot;young Tom Durie&quot;, he gave him his absolute trust. &quot;Though you are but a little man, I shall shortly load your shoulders with business&quot;, the King joked to him at their first meeting. Cecil, who had endured a lifetime of jibes about his height (even Queen Elizabeth had called him &quot;pygmy&quot; and &quot;little man&quot;; he had a curvature of the spine and was barely tall), is unlikely to have found the joke funny, while the crushing weight of business with which the King duly loaded him probably hastened his death at the age of 48. The Venetian ambassador, Nicolò Molin, described Cecil as short and &quot;crook-backed&quot;, with a noble countenance and features.

Cecil was the principal discoverer of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605: at what point he first learned of it, and to what extent he acted as an agent provocateur, has been a subject of controversy ever since. On balance, it seems most likely that he had heard rumors of a plot, but had no firm evidence until the Catholic peer, William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, showed him the celebrated anonymous letter, warning Monteagle to stay away from the opening of Parliament. The Gunpowder Plot itself was a belated reaction to what was seen as the King&#x27;s betrayal of a pledge to repeal, or at least mitigate, the Penal Laws. Cecil was undoubtedly among those who advised King James I not to tamper with the existing laws. However, his attitude to Catholics was not, for the time, especially harsh: he admitted that he was unhappy with the notorious Jesuits, etc. Act 1584, by which any Catholic priest who was found guilty of acting as a priest in England was liable to the death penalty in its most gruesome form. Like most moderate Englishmen at the time, he thought that exile, rather than death, was the appropriate penalty for the priests. Cecil did hope, like his father, to make England the head of the international Protestant alliance, and his last energies were expended in effecting the marriage in 1612 of the princess Elizabeth, James&#x27;s daughter, with Frederick, the Elector Palatine. Still, he was averse to prosecution for religion, and attempted to distinguish between the large body of law-abiding and loyal Catholics and those connected with plots against the throne and government.

The Kingdom of Ireland was a major source of concern and expense during Robert Cecil&#x27;s time in government. The Nine Years&#x27; War there had ended with the leader of the rebels, Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, submitting to the Crown and being restored to his estates, following the Treaty of Mellifont (1603). Four years later, Tyrone led his followers into exile during the Flight of the Earls. The response of the government was to plan a Plantation of Ulster, to share out Tyrone&#x27;s lands between the Gaelic Irish lords and the settlers from Britain. In 1608, Sir Cahir O&#x27;Doherty launched O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s rebellion by attacking and burning Derry. In the wake of O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s defeat at Kilmacrennan, a much larger plantation was undertaken.

Cecil wrote humorous letters to his friend Adam Newton the tutor of Prince Henry. Apologizing for a minor breach of manners, he compared himself to the court jester Tom Durie. In another letter he wrote that if a certain man failed to gain a place in Prince Henry&#x27;s household, he should be sent to &quot;Tom Dyrry or to me&quot;. Although the applicant was poor he could become rich by charging a fee to all the girls in England who wished to meet the Prince.

In 1611 Cecil disapproved of the proposed marriage between the Prince of Wales and the Infanta of Spain. He may have also received a pension from France.

==Lord Treasurer==
As Lord Treasurer, Lord Salisbury, as he became in 1605, showed considerable financial ability. During the year preceding his acceptance of that office in 1608, the expenditure had risen to £500,000, leaving a yearly deficit of £73,000. Lord Salisbury took advantage of the decision by the judges in the Court of Exchequer in Bates&#x27;s Case in favour of the King&#x27;s right to levy impositions (import duties), and imposed new duties on articles of luxury and those of foreign manufacture which competed with English goods. By this measure, and by a more careful collection, the ordinary income was raised to £460,000, while £700,000 was paid off the debt.

In 1610–11, Salisbury worked hard to persuade Parliament to enact the Great Contract, under which the King would give up all his feudal and customary sources of revenue (wardship and purveyance) in return for a fixed annual income of approximately £300,000. The rationale was that the King was spending extravagantly, exceeding his income by £140,000, and putting the kingdom into debt. By 1608, the debt was £1.4 million, although the Lord Treasurer managed to get that down to £300,000 by 1610. The project was one to which Salisbury attached great importance, but the House of Commons eventually lost interest in the plan, and Francis Bacon argued against it, calling it humiliating. King James I also did not show much enthusiasm for it, and it lapsed when the King, against Salisbury&#x27;s advice, dissolved Parliament in 1611. This was a double blow to Lord Salisbury, who was sick and prematurely aged, and conscious that the King now increasingly preferred the company of his male favourites, like The 1st Earl of Somerset. Although it failed to be implemented, the concept of paying an annual income to the monarch was revived some five decades later as a solution to the nation&#x27;s financial problems and formed the basis for the financial settlement at the Restoration of Charles II, through which Charles was to receive an income of approximately £1,200,000 per annum. One historian describes this annual payment as the eventual &quot;implementation of Cecil&#x27;s Great Contract&quot;.

==Houses and the arts==
In May 1591 Cecil was involved in an entertainment for the arrival of Queen Elizabeth at Theobalds, the Hertfordshire family home. The &quot;Hermit&#x27;s Welcome at Theobalds&quot; made allusion to his father&#x27;s potential retirement from public life. In July 1593 a Scottish suitor for Cecil&#x27;s favour, William Dundas of Fingask wrote to him from Edinburgh. Dundas had heard Cecil was completing a gallery in one of his houses and would like paintings with &quot;such toys&quot; or emblems as he had seen himself in Scotland.

In 1606, Lord Salisbury, as Cecil was now, entertained King James I and his brother-in-law, King Christian IV of Denmark, at Theobalds, under the sardonic eye of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s godson, Sir John Harrington. Both monarchs were notoriously heavy drinkers, and according to some of those present, the occasion was simply an orgy of drunkenness, as few English or Danish courtiers had their rulers&#x27; capacity to hold their drink. According to Harrington, who may have been mischievously fictionalising, the masque put on to honour the two kings was a drunken fiasco: &quot;the entertainment and show went forward, and most of the players went backward, or fell down, wine did so occupy their upper chambers&quot;.

In 1607, King James took possession of Theobalds, giving Hatfield Palace to Lord Salisbury in exchange, a relatively old-fashioned property that the King disliked. Salisbury had a disposition for building and tore down parts of it and used its bricks to build Hatfield House. Work continued on the house until 1612. He remodelled Cranborne Manor, originally a small hunting lodge, and built Salisbury House (also referred to as Cecil House), his London residence on the Strand.

The Cecil family fostered arts: they supported musicians such as William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons, Thomas Robinson, and the Irish harper and composer Cormac MacDermott. Byrd composed his famous pavane &quot;The Earle of Salisbury&quot; in his memory. Salisbury&#x27;s motto was &quot;Sero, sed serio&quot;, which can be translated as &#x27;late but in earnest&#x27;.

==Death==
In poor health and worn out by years of overwork, Salisbury, in the spring of 1612, went on a journey to take the waters at Bath in hope of a cure; but he obtained little relief. He started on the journey home but died of cancer, &quot;in great pain and even greater wretchedness of mind&quot;, at Marlborough, Wiltshire, on 24 May 1612, a week short of his 49th birthday. He was buried in St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church, Hatfield, in a tomb designed by Maximilian Colt.

* In the BBC TV drama serial &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; (1971), &quot;Sir Robert Cecil&quot; is played by Hugh Dickson.
* IN the BBC2 &quot;ScreenPlay&quot; episode &quot;Traitors,&quot; he is played by Anton Lesser.
* In the HBO miniseries &quot;Elizabeth I&quot;, Cecil is played by Toby Jones.

* In the alternate history novel &quot;Ruled Britannia&quot;, predicated on the victory of the Spanish Armada in 1588, he and his father organise the English resistance movement against the Spanish with the help of William Shakespeare.
* Robert Cecil was portrayed as the unsympathetic, conniving antagonist of the play, &quot;Equivocation&quot;, written by Bill Cain, which first premiered at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2009. In the play, it is suggested that Cecil was behind the conspiracies of the Gunpowder Plot to kill King James and the royal family. Cecil was first portrayed by Jonathan Haugen. The character in the show was given a serious limp, and is said to hate the word &quot;tomorrow&quot; and to know every detail about everything that goes on in London.
* He is portrayed extremely unsympathetically in &quot;The Desperate Remedy: Henry Gresham and the Gunpowder Plot&quot; by Martin Stephen (), as malevolently self-centred, exploiting the plot to try to bolster his own position in face of his unpopularity.
* He is a minor character in the children&#x27;s novel &quot;Cue for Treason&quot; by Geoffrey Trease, where he is portrayed positively.
* Robert Cecil is portrayed sympathetically in the historical mystery series featuring Joan and Matthew Stock, written by Leonard Tourney, where he is a patron to the main characters. The first novel is &quot;The Players&#x27; Boy is Dead&quot;.

Cecil&#x27;s dramatic function is to demonstrate the complexity of history as opposed to simplistic pieties that would turn O&#x27;Neill into yet another victim of the English. Cecil &#x27;obliges&#x27; O&#x27;Neill to reenact the past so the audience witnesses the moral dilemma of a man torn between two cultures and keenly aware of the advance of modernity in a troubled political, cultural and religious context.
* He is portrayed by Tim McInnerny in the 2004 TV mini series &quot;Gunpowder, Treason &amp; Plot&quot;.

<text>The Princes in the Tower refers to the mystery of the fate of the deposed King Edward V of England and his younger brother Prince Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, heirs to the throne of King Edward IV of England. The brothers were the only sons of the king by his queen, Elizabeth Woodville, living at the time of their father&#x27;s death in 1483. Aged 12 and 9 years old, respectively, they were lodged in the Tower of London by their paternal uncle and England&#x27;s regent, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, in preparation for Edward V&#x27;s forthcoming coronation. Before the young king&#x27;s coronation, however, he and his brother were declared illegitimate by Parliament. Gloucester ascended the throne as Richard III.

It is unclear what happened to the two princes after the last recorded sighting of them in the tower. It is generally assumed that they were murdered; a common hypothesis is that the murder was commissioned by Richard III in an attempt to secure his hold on the throne. Their deaths may have occurred sometime in 1483, but apart from their disappearance, the only evidence is circumstantial. As a result, several other theories about their fates have been proposed, including the suggestion that they were murdered by their kinsman the Duke of Buckingham, their future brother-in-law King Henry VII, or his mother Lady Margaret Beaufort, among others. It has also been suggested that one or both princes may have escaped assassination. In 1487, Lambert Simnel initially was crowned in Dublin as &quot;King Edward&quot;, but later claimed by others to be York&#x27;s cousin the Earl of Warwick. And again several years later, from 1491 until his capture in 1497, Perkin Warbeck claimed to be the Duke of York, having supposedly escaped to Flanders. Warbeck&#x27;s claim was supported by some contemporaries, including York&#x27;s aunt the Duchess of Burgundy.

In 1674, workmen at the Tower of London excavated, from under a staircase, a wooden box containing two small human skeletons. The bones were widely accepted at the time as those of the princes, but this has not been proven and is far from certain. King Charles II had the bones buried in Westminster Abbey, where they remain.

==Background==
On 9 April 1483, Edward IV of England died unexpectedly after an illness lasting around three weeks. At the time, Edward&#x27;s son, the new King Edward V, was at Ludlow Castle, and the dead king&#x27;s brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire. The news reached Gloucester around 15 April, although he may have been forewarned of Edward&#x27;s illness. It is reported that he then went to York Minster to publicly &quot;pledge his loyalty to his new king&quot;. The &quot;Croyland Chronicle&quot; states that, before his death, Edward IV designated his brother Gloucester as Lord Protector. Edward&#x27;s request may not have mattered, however, since &quot;as the precedent of Henry V showed, the Privy Council was not bound to follow the wishes of a dead king&quot;.

Edward V and Gloucester set out for London from the west and north respectively, meeting at Stony Stratford on 29 April. The following morning, Gloucester arrested Edward&#x27;s retinue including the boys&#x27; uncle, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, and their half-brother Sir Richard Grey. They were sent to Pontefract Castle in Yorkshire where, on 25 June, they were beheaded. Gloucester then took possession of the prince himself, prompting Elizabeth Woodville to take her other son, Richard, Duke of York, and her daughters into sanctuary at Westminster Abbey.

Edward V and Gloucester arrived in London together. Plans continued for Edward&#x27;s official coronation, but the date was postponed from 4 May to 25 June. On 19 May 1483, Edward was lodged in the Tower of London, then the traditional residence of monarchs prior to the coronation. On 16 June, he was joined by his younger brother Richard, Duke of York, who was previously in sanctuary. At this point, the date of Edward&#x27;s coronation was indefinitely postponed by their uncle, Gloucester. On Sunday 22 June, a sermon was preached by Dr. Ralph Shaa, brother of the Lord Mayor of London, at Saint Paul&#x27;s Cross claiming Gloucester to be the only legitimate heir of the House of York. On 25 June, &quot;a group of lords, knights and gentlemen&quot; petitioned Richard to take the throne. Both princes were subsequently declared illegitimate by Parliament; this was confirmed in 1484 by an Act of Parliament known as &quot;Titulus Regius&quot;. The act stated that Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville&#x27;s marriage was invalid because of Edward&#x27;s pre-contract of marriage with Lady Eleanor Butler. Gloucester was crowned King Richard III of England on 6 July. The declaration of the boys&#x27; illegitimacy has been described by Rosemary Horrox as an &quot;ex post facto&quot; justification for Richard&#x27;s accession.

==Disappearance==
Dominic Mancini, an Italian friar who visited England in the 1480s and who was in London in the spring and summer of 1483, recorded that after Richard III seized the throne, Edward and his younger brother Richard were taken into the &quot;inner apartments of the Tower&quot; and then were seen less and less, until they disappeared altogether. Mancini records that, during this period, Edward was regularly visited by a doctor, who reported that Edward, &quot;like a victim prepared for sacrifice, sought remission of his sins by daily confession and penance, because he believed that death was facing him&quot;. The Latin reference to &quot;Argentinus medicus&quot;, was originally translated as &quot;a Strasbourg doctor&quot;; however, D.E. Rhodes suggests it may actually refer to &quot;Doctor Argentine&quot;, whom Rhodes identifies as John Argentine, an English physician who later served as provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and as doctor to Arthur, Prince of Wales, eldest son of King Henry VII of England (Henry Tudor).

There are reports of the two princes being seen playing in the tower grounds shortly after Richard joined his brother, but there are no recorded sightings of either of them after the summer of 1483. An attempt to rescue them in late July failed. Their fate remains an enduring mystery.

Many historians believe that the princes were murdered; some have suggested that the act may have happened towards the end of summer 1483. Maurice Keen argues that the rebellion against Richard in 1483 initially &quot;aimed to rescue Edward V and his brother from the Tower before it was too late&quot;, but that, when the Duke of Buckingham became involved, it shifted to support of Henry Tudor because &quot;Buckingham almost certainly knew that the princes in the Tower were dead.&quot; Alison Weir proposes 3 September 1483 as a potential date; however, Weir&#x27;s work has been criticised for &quot;arriving at a conclusion that depends more on her own imagination than on the uncertain evidence she has so misleadingly presented&quot;.

Clements Markham suggests the princes may have been alive as late as July 1484, pointing to the regulations issued by Richard III&#x27;s household which stated: &quot;the children should be together at one breakfast&quot;. James Gairdner, however, argues that it is unclear to whom the phrase &quot;the children&quot; alludes, and that it may not have been a reference to the princes. It may refer to Edward, Earl of Warwick (son of the Duke of Clarence) and Edward IV&#x27;s two youngest daughters (Catherine and Bridget), all of whom were living under Richard&#x27;s care at Sheriff Hutton.

===Rumours===
Several sources suggest there were rumours of the princes&#x27; deaths in the time following their disappearance. Rumours of murder appeared in France. In January 1484, Guillaume de Rochefort, Lord Chancellor of France, urged the Estates General to &quot;take warning&quot; from the fate of the princes, as their own king, Charles VIII, was only 13. The early reports, including that of Rochefort, Philippe de Commines (French politician), Caspar Weinreich (contemporary German chronicler) and Jan Allertz (Recorder of Rotterdam), all state that Richard killed the princes before he seized the throne (thus before June 1483). De Commines&#x27; &quot;Memoirs&quot; (c.1500), however, identifies the Duke of Buckingham as the person &quot;who put them to death&quot;.
Other than their disappearance, there is no direct evidence that the princes were murdered, and &quot;no reliable, well-informed, independent or impartial sources&quot; for the associated events. Nevertheless, following their disappearance, rumours spread in France that they had been murdered. Before November 2023, only one contemporary narrative account of the boys&#x27; time in the tower was known to exist: that of Dominic Mancini. Mancini&#x27;s account was not discovered until 1934, in the Municipal Library in Lille. Later accounts written after the accession of Henry Tudor are usually biased or influenced by Tudor propaganda.

Only Mancini&#x27;s account, written in London before November 1483, is contemporary. The Croyland Chronicle and de Commines&#x27; account were written three and seventeen years later, respectively (and thus after Richard III&#x27;s death and the accession of Henry VII). Markham, writing long before Mancini&#x27;s account was discovered, argued that some accounts, including the Croyland Chronicle, might have been authored or heavily influenced by John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury, in order to incriminate Richard III.

===Early writers===

Robert Fabyan&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of London&quot;, compiled around 30 years after the princes&#x27; disappearance, names Richard as murderer.

Thomas More (a Tudor loyalist who had grown up in the household of John Morton, an avowed foe of Richard III) wrote The &quot;History of King Richard III&quot;, c.1513. This identified Sir James Tyrrell as the murderer, acting on Richard&#x27;s orders. Tyrrell was the loyal servant of Richard III who is said to have confessed to the murder of the princes before his execution for treason in 1502. In his history, More said that the princes were smothered to death in their beds by two agents of Tyrrell (Miles Forrest and John Dighton) and were then buried &quot;at the stayre foote, metely depe in the grounde vnder a great heape of stones&quot;, but were later disinterred and buried in a secret place. Historian Tim Thornton claimed that the sons of Miles Forrest were at court in Henry VIII&#x27;s England, and Thomas More&#x27;s contacts with them could have given him the detail of the murder.

Polydore Vergil, in his &quot;Anglica Historia&quot; (c.1513), also specifies that Tyrrell was the murderer, stating that he &quot;rode sorrowfully to London&quot; and committed the deed with reluctance, upon Richard III&#x27;s orders, and that Richard himself spread the rumours of the princes&#x27; death in the belief that it would discourage rebellion.

&quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;, written in the second half of the 16th century, claims that the princes were murdered by Richard III. The chronicles were one of the main sources used by William Shakespeare for his play &quot;Richard III&quot;, which also portrays Richard as the murderer, in the sense that he commissions Tyrrell to have the boys killed. A. J. Pollard believes that the chronicle&#x27;s account reflected the contemporary &quot;standard and accepted account&quot;, but that by the time it was written, &quot;propaganda had been transformed into historical fact&quot;.

More wrote his account with the intention of writing about a moral point rather than a closely mirrored history. While More&#x27;s account does rely on some firsthand sources, the account is generally taken from other sources. Additionally, More&#x27;s account is one of the bases for Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;, which similarly indicts Richard for murdering the young princes.

On 17 July 1674, workmen remodelling the Tower of London dug up a wooden box containing two small human skeletons. The bones were found buried under the staircase leading to the chapel of the White Tower. The remains were not the first children&#x27;s skeletons found within the tower; the bones of two children had previously been found &quot;in an old chamber that had been walled up&quot;, which Pollard suggests could equally well have been those of the princes. The reason the bones were attributed to the princes was because the location partially matched the account given by More. However, More further stated that they were later moved to a &quot;better place&quot;, which disagrees with where the bones were discovered. The staircase that the bones were found underneath had not yet been built, at the time of Richard III. One anonymous report was that they were found with &quot;pieces of rag and velvet about them&quot;; the velvet could indicate that the bodies were those of aristocrats. Four years after their discovery, the bones were placed in an urn and, on the orders of King Charles II, interred in Westminster Abbey, in the wall of the Henry VII Lady Chapel. A monument designed by Christopher Wren marks the resting place of the putative princes. The inscription, written in Latin, states &quot;Here lie interred the remains of Edward V, King of England, and Richard, Duke of York, whose long desired and much sought after bones, after over a hundred and ninety years, were found interred deep beneath the rubble of the stairs that led up to the Chapel of the White Tower, on the 17 of July in the Year of Our Lord 1674.&quot;

The bones were removed and examined in 1933 by the archivist of Westminster Abbey, Lawrence Tanner; a leading anatomist, Professor William Wright; and the president of the Dental Association, George Northcroft. By measuring certain bones and teeth, they concluded the bones belonged to two children around the correct ages for the princes. The bones were found to have been interred carelessly along with chicken and other animal bones. There were also three very rusty nails. One skeleton was larger than the other, but many of the bones were missing, including part of the smaller jawbone and all of the teeth from the larger one. Many of the bones had been broken by the original workmen. The examination has been criticised, on the grounds that it was conducted on the presumption that the bones were those of the princes and concentrated only on whether the bones showed evidence of suffocation; no attempt was even made to determine whether the bones were male or female.

No further scientific examination has since been conducted on the bones, which remain in Westminster Abbey; further, DNA analysis (if DNA could be obtained) has not been attempted. A petition was started on the British government&#x27;s &quot;e-petition&quot; website requesting that the bones be DNA tested, but was closed months before its expected close date. If it had received 100,000 signatories a parliamentary debate would have been triggered. Pollard points out that even if modern DNA and carbon dating proved the bones belonged to the princes, it would not prove who or what killed them.

=== St George&#x27;s Chapel ===
In 1789, workmen carrying out repairs in St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, rediscovered and accidentally broke into the vault of Edward IV and Queen Elizabeth Woodville, discovering in the process what appeared to be a small adjoining vault. This vault was found to contain the coffins of two unidentified children. However, no inspection or examination was carried out and the tomb was resealed. The tomb was inscribed with the names of two of Edward IV&#x27;s children: George, 1st Duke of Bedford who had died at the age of 2, and Mary of York who had died at the age of 14; both had predeceased the king.
However, two lead coffins clearly labelled as George Plantagenet and Mary Plantagenet were subsequently discovered elsewhere in the chapel (during the excavation for the royal tomb house for King George III under the Wolsey tomb-house in 1810–13), and were moved into the adjoining vault of Edward IV&#x27;s, but at the time no effort was made to identify the two lead coffins already in Edward IV&#x27;s vault.

In the late 1990s, work was being carried out near and around Edward IV&#x27;s tomb in St George&#x27;s Chapel; the floor area was excavated to replace an old boiler and also to add a new repository for the remains of future Deans and Canons of Windsor. A request was forwarded to the Dean and Canons of Windsor to consider a possible examination of the two vaults either by fibre-optic camera or, if possible, a reexamination of the two unidentified lead coffins in the tomb also housing the lead coffins of two of Edward IV&#x27;s children that were discovered during the building of the Royal Tomb for King George III (1810–13) and placed in the adjoining vault at that time. Royal consent would be necessary to open any royal tomb, so it was felt best to leave the medieval mystery unsolved for at least the next few generations. The 2012 discovery of the remains of Richard III has prompted renewed interest in re-excavating the skeletons of the &quot;two princes&quot;, but Queen Elizabeth II never granted the approval required for any such testing of an interred royal. In 2022, Tracy Borman, joint chief curator of Historic Royal Palaces, stated that King Charles III held &quot;a very different view&quot; on the subject and could potentially support an investigation.

===Unidentified bodies===
Four unidentified bodies have been found which are considered possibly connected with the events of this period: two at the Tower of London and two in Saint George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Those found in the tower were buried in Westminster Abbey, but authorities have refused to allow either set of remains to be subjected to DNA analysis to positively identify them as the remains of the princes. It is now possible to determine whether or not any remains are the two princes, since Richard III&#x27;s DNA is on record, following his body&#x27;s discovery in a Leicester car park.

==Theories==

The absence of hard evidence of what happened to the princes has led to a number of theories being put forward. The most common theory is that they were murdered close to the time that they disappeared, and among historians and authors who accept the murder theory, the most common explanation is that they were murdered at the behest of Richard III.

===Richard III===
Many historians conclude that Richard III, the princes&#x27; uncle, is the likeliest culprit in the case of the disappearance of the princes for a number of reasons. Although the princes had been eliminated from the succession, Richard&#x27;s hold on the monarchy was very insecure due to the way in which he had attained the crown, leading to a backlash against him by the Yorkist establishment. An attempt had already been made to rescue them and restore Edward to the throne, clear evidence that the existence of the princes would remain a threat as long as they were alive. The boys could have been used by Richard&#x27;s enemies as figureheads for rebellion. Rumours of their death were in circulation by late 1483, but Richard never attempted to prove that they were alive by having them seen in public, which strongly suggests that they were dead by then. However, he did not remain silent on the matter. Raphael Holinshed, in his &quot;Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland&quot;, written in 1577, reports that Richard, &quot;what with purging and declaring his innocence concerning the murder of his nephews towards the world, and what with cost to obtain the love and favour of the communal tie (which outwardlie glosed, and openly dissembled with him) ... gave prodigally so many and so great rewards, that now both he lacked, and scarce with honesty how to borrow&quot;. Richard also failed to open any investigation into the matter, which would have been in his interest if he was not responsible for the deaths of his nephews.

Richard was on a progression through the Yorkist heartlands at the time the princes were last seen alive. They were under guard in the Tower of London, which was controlled by his men, and access to them was strictly limited by his instructions. It is unlikely they could have been murdered without his knowledge. More and Polydore Vergil both name Sir James Tyrrell as the murderer. Tyrrell, an English knight who fought for the House of York on many occasions, was arrested by Henry VII&#x27;s forces in 1502 for supporting another Yorkist claimant to the throne. Shortly before his execution, Tyrrell is said by More to have admitted, under torture, to having murdered the princes at the behest of Richard III. The only record of this is the writing of Thomas More, who wrote that, during his examination, Tyrrell made his confession as to the murders, saying that Richard III ordered their deaths. He also implicated two other men; despite further questioning, however, he was unable to say where the bodies were, claiming that Brackenbury had moved them. William Shakespeare portrays him as the culprit, sought out by Richard after Buckingham demurs. This version of events is accepted by Alison Weir and Hicks notes that his successful career and rapid promotion after 1483 &quot;is consistent with his alleged murder of the princes&quot;. However, the only record of Tyrrell&#x27;s confession is through More, and &quot;no actual confession has ever been found&quot;. Pollard casts doubts on the accuracy of More&#x27;s accounts, suggesting it was &quot;an elaboration of one of several circulating accounts&quot;; however, he does not discount the possibility of it being &quot;just his own invention&quot;, pointing to the &quot;clear similarities to the stories of the Babes in the Wood&quot;. Clements Markham suggested that More&#x27;s account was actually written by Archbishop Morton and that Tyrrell was induced to do the deed by Henry VII between 16 June and 16 July 1486, the dates of two general pardons that he received from the king. However, a registry copy of a will dated to 1516 has been rediscovered in the British National Archives, written by Tyrrell&#x27;s sister-in-law Dame Margaret Capel, wife of William Capel, in which she bequeaths a gold chain to her son Giles that had belonged to her husband and before him, to Edward V, possibly his chain of office. William Capel appears to have given the chain to his wife while he was alive, as it is not mentioned in his will, nor is it mentioned in the will of Giles or any of his descendants. Although it is unknown how the chain came into William&#x27;s possession, he is recorded to have exchanged jewellery with the Tyrrells. This revelation has revived interest in More&#x27;s account.

Richard&#x27;s guilt was widely accepted by contemporaries. George Cely, Dominic Mancini, John Rous, Fabyan&#x27;s Chronicle, the Crowland Chronicler and the London Chronicle all noted the disappearance of the Princes, and all bar Mancini (who noted that he had no knowledge of what had happened) repeated rumours naming Richard as the murderer. Guillaume de Rochefort, Chancellor of France, named Richard as the murderer to the Estates General at Tours in January 1484. It also appears to have been the belief of Elizabeth Woodville, who would go on to support Henry Tudor in his campaign against Richard III. One possible motive for Elizabeth Woodville subsequently making her peace with Richard and bringing her daughters out of sanctuary could be that Richard had to swear a solemn oath, before witnesses, to protect and provide for her surviving children, which made it much less likely they could be quietly murdered as it was believed their brothers had been.

In line with this contemporary opinion many current historians, including David Starkey, Michael Hicks, Helen Castor and A. J. Pollard regard Richard himself as the most likely culprit. There was no formal accusation against Richard III on the matter; the Bill of Attainder brought by Henry VII made no definitive mention of the Princes in the Tower, but it did accuse Richard of &quot;the unnatural, mischievous and great perjuries, treasons, homicides and murders, in shedding of infant&#x27;s blood, with many other wrongs, odious offences and abominations against God and man&quot;. The &quot;shedding of infant&#x27;s blood&quot; may be an accusation of the Princes&#x27; murder. Hicks speculated that it was a reference to speeches made in Parliament condemning the murder of the princes, which suggested that Richard&#x27;s guilt had become common knowledge, or at least common wisdom.

===Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham===
The plausibility of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, Richard&#x27;s right-hand man, as a suspect depends on the princes having already been dead by the time Stafford was executed in November 1483. It has been suggested that Buckingham had several potential motives. As a descendant of Edward III, through Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, on his father&#x27;s side, as well as through John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, through John Beaufort, on his mother&#x27;s side, Buckingham may have hoped to accede to the throne himself in due course; alternatively, he may have been acting on behalf of a third party.

Some, notably Paul Murray Kendall, regard Buckingham as the likeliest suspect: his execution, after he had rebelled against Richard in October 1483, might signify that he and the king had fallen out; Weir takes this as a sign that Richard had murdered the princes without Buckingham&#x27;s knowledge and Buckingham had been shocked by it. A contemporary Portuguese document suggests Buckingham as the guilty party, stating &quot;... and after the passing away of king Edward in the year of 83, another one of his brothers, the Duke of Gloucester, had in his power the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, the young sons of the said king and his brother, and turned them to the Duke of Buckingham, under whose custody the said Princes were starved to death&quot;. A document dated some decades after the disappearance was found within the archives of the College of Arms in London in 1980; this stated that the murder &quot;be the vise of the Duke of Buckingham&quot;. This led Michael Bennett to suggest that possibly some of Richard&#x27;s prominent supporters, Buckingham and James Tyrrell, murdered the princes on their own initiative without waiting for Richard&#x27;s orders. Bennett noted in support of this theory: &quot;After the King&#x27;s departure Buckingham was in effective command in the capital, and it is known that when the two men met a month later there was an unholy row between them.&quot;

Buckingham is the only person to be named as responsible in a contemporary chronicle other than Richard himself. However, for two reasons he is unlikely to have acted alone. First of all, if he were guilty of acting without Richard&#x27;s orders, it is extremely surprising that Richard did not lay the blame for the princes&#x27; murder on Buckingham after Buckingham was disgraced and executed, especially as Richard could potentially have cleared his own name by doing so. Secondly, it is likely he would have required Richard&#x27;s help to gain access to the princes, under close guard in the Tower of London, although Kendall argued as Constable of England, he might have been exempt from this ruling. As a result, although it is extremely possible that he was implicated in the decision to murder them, the hypothesis that he acted without Richard&#x27;s knowledge is not widely accepted by historians. While Jeremy Potter suggested that Richard would have kept silent had Buckingham been guilty because nobody would have believed Richard was not party to the crime, he further notes that &quot;Historians are agreed that Buckingham would never have dared to act without Richard&#x27;s complicity, or at least, connivance&quot;. However, Potter also hypothesised that perhaps Buckingham was fantasising about seizing the crown himself at this point and saw the murder of the princes as a first step to achieving this goal. This theory formed the basis of Sharon Penman&#x27;s historical novel, &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot;.

===Henry VII===
Henry VII (Henry Tudor), following his seizure of the crown, executed some of the rival claimants to the throne. John of Gloucester, illegitimate son of Richard III, is said by some sources to have been one of those executed. Henry was out of the country between the princes&#x27; disappearance and August 1485, thus his only opportunity to murder them would have been after his accession in 1485. Pollard suggests Henry (or those acting on his orders) is &quot;the only plausible alternative to Richard III&quot;.

The year after becoming king, Henry married the princes&#x27; eldest sister, Elizabeth of York, to reinforce his claim to the throne. Not wanting the legitimacy of his wife or her claim as heir of Edward IV called into question, prior to the marriage he had repealed the &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; which had previously declared the princes (and Elizabeth) illegitimate. Markham (1906) suggested that the princes were executed under Henry&#x27;s orders between 16 June and 16 July 1486, claiming that it was only after this date that orders went out to circulate the story that Richard had killed the princes; this claim has been disproven. Markham also suggested that the princes&#x27; mother, Elizabeth Woodville, knew that this story was false, and that this was the motivation behind Henry&#x27;s decision, in February 1487, to confiscate all of Elizabeth&#x27;s lands and possessions, and have her confined to Bermondsey Abbey, &quot;where she died six years afterwards&quot;. However, Arlene Okerlund suggests that her retirement to the abbey was her own decision, while Michael Bennett and Timothy Elston suggest the move was precautionary, precipitated by Lambert Simnel&#x27;s claim to be her son Richard. Pollard calls Markham&#x27;s theory &quot;highly speculative&quot;, and states that Henry&#x27;s silence over the princes was more likely &quot;political calculation than personal guilt&quot;. Henry was also never accused of the murder by any contemporary, not even by his enemies, which he likely would have been had contemporaries thought there was any possibility of his guilt. Jeremy Potter, at the time he wrote Chairman of the Richard III Society, noted, &quot;With Henry, as with Richard, there is no real evidence and one must suspect that if he had killed the princes himself he would quickly have produced the corpses and some ingeniously appropriate story implicating Richard.&quot; Further, Raphael Holinshed reported in 1577 that Richard &quot;purged and declared his innocence&quot; regarding &quot;the murther of his nephews towards the world&quot;, indicating that the boys did indeed meet their end during Richard&#x27;s days. It is also unlikely that the princes would have been kept alive in secret by Richard for two years after their last sighting while rumours of his responsibility for their murder circulated.

===Other suspects===
Some scholars have instead accused John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk, Margaret Beaufort (Henry VII&#x27;s mother), or Jane Shore (Edward IV&#x27;s mistress). The Beaufort theory was supported by Philippa Gregory in a 2013 BBC documentary series &quot;The Real White Queen and her Rivals&quot;, However, it has been sustained only by speculation about a possible motive, rather than evidence. Pollard has commented regarding such theories: &quot;None deserve serious consideration. The problem with all these accusations is that they beg the question of access to the Tower without Richard&#x27;s knowledge and overlook the fact that Richard was responsible for the safekeeping of his nephews&quot;.

===Survival theories===
Historian David Baldwin suggests that Henry VII&#x27;s reticence on the subject may have been because at least one of the princes was still alive; he considers that Richard is more likely to have survived, with Edward dying of a malady. Baldwin argues that it is &quot;impossible&quot; that no one knew what happened to the Princes after they entered the Tower; he believes Richard III and Henry VII, leading courtiers and their mother would all have known the boys&#x27; whereabouts and welfare. Baldwin argues that had this been the case, Henry VII would have had the choice of keeping quiet about the survival of Richard, or having him executed, and concluded, &quot;He [Henry] would have been happy to let people &quot;think&quot; the boys had been murdered, but not to speculate when or by whose hand.&quot;

During the reign of Henry VII, two individuals claimed to be the princes who had somehow escaped death. Lambert Simnel was crowned as &quot;King Edward&quot; in Dublin, with his supporters naming him as Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick. Perkin Warbeck later claimed to be Richard, appearing in Ireland and calling himself king Richard IV. Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy, formally recognised Warbeck as Richard. Margaret, Richard III&#x27;s sister, an unrelenting opponent of Henry VII, had previously recognised Simnel as Warwick. Warbeck was also accepted as Richard by James IV of Scotland. After a failed attempt to invade England he was captured. He retracted his claims, was imprisoned and later executed. Many modern historians believe he was an imposter, whose supporters accepted his claim for political reasons.

The fact that two persons claimed to be Richard led the 18th-century writer Horace Walpole to argue that Richard had in fact escaped death, and that Warbeck genuinely was Richard, a view also supported by the Scottish historian Malcolm Laing. Walpole, however, later retracted his views and stated that he now believed the princes to have been murdered by Richard III to secure his hold on the crown. In more recent times the theory that Warbeck was Richard has been endorsed by Annette Carson, a freelance writer with a &quot;lifelong interest&quot; in Richard III. She suggested that Richard smuggled the princes abroad to the custody of their aunt, the Duchess of Burgundy, and they were raised there under false identities. Baldwin suggested that by having removed them from sight to prevent them being a focus for opposition, he was then unable to bring them back to court to scotch rumours of their murder without once again having them become a threat. This theory has also been endorsed by Philippa Langley, known for the discovery of Richard III&#x27;s body in 2012, who claims that contemporary documents show the two princes were alive and in contact with royals on the European continent as late as 1493, and suggests that the youths known to history as Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck were genuinely the Earl of Warwick and Richard, Duke of York. One of the sources is a statement (dated 1493) purported to have been written by Richard, describing his escape and flight to Europe, which has been independently authenticated as a late 15th-century document; another is a document claiming that Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, had identified a man as Prince Richard by examining three birthmarks on his body.

In 2021, researchers from the &quot;Missing Princes Project&quot; claimed to have found evidence that Edward had lived out his days in the rural Devon village of Coldridge. They have linked the 13-year-old prince with a man named John Evans, who arrived in the village around 1484, and was immediately given an official position and the title of Lord of the Manor. Researcher John Dike noted Yorkist symbols and stained glass windows depicting Edward V in a Coldridge chapel commissioned by Evans and built around 1511, unusual for the location.

Other findings of the five-year investigation by The Missing Princes Project research initiative, suggesting the Princes&#x27; survival following the reign of Richard III (i.e. after 22 August 1485), was published on 19 November 2023 in Philippa Langley&#x27;s book &quot;The Princes in the Tower: Solving History&#x27;s Greatest Cold Case&quot; (The History Press). New archival discoveries had been made for both sons of Edward IV: Edward V in an accounting receipt for King Maximilian I dated 16 December 1487 in the archive in Lille, France, discovered by project member, Albert Jan de Rooij. The accounting receipt confirmed that weapons (400 pikes) purchased by Maximilian for the Yorkist invasion of June 1487 was on behalf of the elder son of Edward IV.

This new evidence was presented in the UK on Channel 4 in an original 1 hour 45-minute &quot;Factual Special&quot; documentary, &quot;The Princes in the Tower&quot; (18 November 2023, Brinkworth Productions, Dir: Janice Sutherland). The documentary was also broadcast by SBS in Australia (19 November 2023) and PBS in America (22 November 2023) as part of their &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; series. The programme followed criminal barrister Rob Rinder as he investigated new evidence from Langley&#x27;s research initiative.

==Impact==
The political reality of the disappearance of the princes, whatever happened to them, is that they were believed to have been murdered and Richard was blamed for their murders. Even if he had not been directly responsible for their deaths, the fact that he had deposed them and kept them under tight guard made him responsible for their welfare in the eyes of contemporaries, and the belief that they had been murdered made him guilty. As Baldwin noted in support of his conclusion that Richard would not have murdered the princes, &quot;It seems incredible Richard ever supposed killing his nephews would help secure his position or make him more acceptable to his subjects.&quot; An initial uprising in September 1483, aimed at deposing Richard and restoring Edward V to the throne, was not stopped by rumours of Edward&#x27;s murder. Instead, the rebels rallied around Henry Tudor as a potential alternative candidate; Horrox says Tudor was &quot;an inconceivable choice if Edward V and his brother were thought to be still available&quot;.

Anthony Cheetham, who considered Richard likely to have had the princes murdered, commented that it was &quot;a colossal blunder. Nothing else could have prompted the deflated Woodvilles to hitch themselves to Henry Tudor&#x27;s bandwagon.&quot; The fact that the majority of the rebels were wealthy and powerful southern noblemen, loyal to Edward IV, suggests a degree of revulsion against Richard&#x27;s usurpation of the throne: their willingness to fight on under an implausible alternative candidate suggests that they regarded anyone as preferable to Richard as King due to his usurpation and the murder of his nephews. Bennett suggested that perhaps those who had initially supported Richard in his seizure of power may have felt complicit in the crime, which he thought &quot;might explain the bitterness of the subsequent recriminations against him&quot;. Hicks speculated that these men may have been &quot;appalled by the character of the regime...shocked by Richard&#x27;s crimes&quot;. Their defection severely weakened Richard, who had to impose his supporters among the northern lords as officeholders in the southern counties to maintain order, in itself a very unpopular act that further damaged his reputation. In Pollard&#x27;s words, &quot;the belief that he had murdered his nephews seriously handicapped Richard&#x27;s efforts to secure himself on the throne he had usurped&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The mystery of the Princes in the Tower has spawned best-selling novels such as Josephine Tey&#x27;s &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot; and four novels in Philippa Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Cousins&#x27; War&quot; series, and continues to attract the attention of historians and novelists.

*The first series of the British sitcom &quot;Blackadder&quot; is set in a comic alternative history where the Princes in the Tower survived and grew to adulthood. Prince Richard, the father of main protagonist Edmund Plantagenet, assumed the throne as Richard IV following the accidental death of Richard III after a Yorkist victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field. There is no explanation of what became of Edward V. According to the show, Henry VII assumed power after the finale and erased Richard IV&#x27;s reign from history, along with ruining the reputation of Richard III.
*An episode of the Canadian children&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Mystery Hunters&quot; is dedicated to the unsolved case of the missing princes.
*In 1984, Channel 4 broadcast a four-hour &quot;trial&quot; of Richard III on the charge of murdering the princes. The presiding judge was Lord Elwyn-Jones and the barristers were recruited from the Queen&#x27;s Counsel, but had to remain anonymous. Expert witnesses included David Starkey. The jury was composed of ordinary citizens. The burden of proof was left to the prosecution. The jury found in favour of the defendant.
*In 2005 Channel 4 and RDF Media produced a drama entitled &quot;Princes in the Tower&quot; about the interrogation of Perkin Warbeck, in which Warbeck almost convinces Henry VII that he really is Richard, Duke of York.

<text>The Montreal Alouettes (French: Les Alouettes de Montréal) are a professional Canadian football team based in Montreal, Quebec. Founded in 1946, the team has disbanded twice and been re-established thrice. The Alouettes compete in the East Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and last won the Grey Cup in 2023, defeating the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the 110th Grey Cup Game in 2023. Their home field is Percival Molson Memorial Stadium for the regular season and as of 2014 also home of their playoff games.

The original Alouettes team (1946–1981) won the Grey Cup four times and were particularly dominant in the 1970s; appearing in six Grey Cup Finals through that decade, they won in 1970, 1974 and 1977, while losing in 1975, 1978 and 1979 (all against the Edmonton Eskimos). After their collapse in 1982, they were immediately reconstituted under new ownership as the Montreal Concordes. After playing for four years as the Concordes, they revived the Alouettes name for the 1986 season. A second folding in 1987 led to a nine-year hiatus of CFL football in the city.

The current Alouettes franchise was established in 1996 by the owner of the Baltimore Stallions. The Stallions were disbanded at the same time as the Alouettes&#x27; re-establishment after having been the most successful of the CFL&#x27;s American expansion franchises, culminating in a Grey Cup championship in 1995. Many players from the Stallions&#x27; 1995 roster signed with the Alouettes and formed the core of the team&#x27;s 1996 roster.

For record-keeping purposes, the CFL considers all clubs that have played in Montreal as one franchise dating to 1946, and considers the Alouettes to have suspended operations in 1987 before returning in 1996. Although the Alouettes&#x27; re-establishment in 1996 is often considered a relocation of the Stallions, neither the league nor the Alouettes recognize the Baltimore franchise, or its records, as part of the Alouettes&#x27; official team history.

The latest incarnation of the Alouettes were arguably the best CFL team of the 2000s; they acceded to every Grey Cup Finals of the decade (except in 2001, 2004 and 2007) taking home three Grey Cups in the process and bringing the franchise total to seven. The Alouettes had from 1996 to 2014 the CFL&#x27;s longest active playoff streak, only having missed the playoffs three times since returning to the league. The streak came to an end in 2015. They have hosted a playoff game every year except 2001, 2007, 2013, and from 2015 to 2018. Their five losing seasons came in 2007, 2013 and from 2015 to 2018. The 2015 through 2018 Alouettes&#x27; seasons marked the first time the team missed the playoffs in consecutive years since their re-activation. Major stars of the recent era include Mike Pringle, the CFL career leader in rushing yards, and quarterback Anthony Calvillo, who led all of pro football in career passing yards before Drew Brees took over in late 2020.

In 2019 the CFL purchased the team from American businessman Robert Wetenhall, who could not find a buyer. Later that year the Alouettes were acquired by Crawford Steel executives Sid Spiegel and his son-in-law Gary Stern (through their subsidiary S and S Sportsco), who took over the team on January 6, 2020. In February 2023, the ownership was passed back to the league, which subsequently agreed to sell the team to Quebec media mogul and former Parti Québécois leader Pierre Karl Péladeau in March of that year. On November 19, 2023, the Alouettes won their eighth Grey Cup in their first season under Péladeau&#x27;s ownership.

==History==
=== Original Alouettes (1946–1981) ===

Canadian football has a long history in Montreal, dating to the 1850s. The Alouettes were first formed in 1946 by Canadian Football Hall of Famer Lew Hayman along with stockbroker Eric Cradock and former Montreal Canadiens part-owner Léo Dandurand. They named themselves after &quot;&quot;Alouette&quot;&quot;, a work song about plucking the feathers from a skylark, which had become a symbol of the Québécois. The origin of the team&#x27;s name also comes from the Second World War-era No. 425 &quot;Alouette&quot; Squadron, a bomber squadron operating out of North Africa and later Yorkshire, England. 425 Squadron was also the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s primarily French-Canadian squadron.

They won their first Grey Cup championship in 1949, beating Calgary 28–15 led by quarterback Frank Filchock and running back Virgil Wagner.

The 1950s were a productive decade for the Als, with quarterback Sam Etcheverry throwing passes to John &quot;Red&quot; O&#x27;Quinn, &quot;Prince&quot; Hal Patterson, and with Pat Abbruzzi carrying the ball, Montreal fielded the most dangerous offence in all Canadian football. From 1954 to 1956, they reached the Grey Cup in three consecutive seasons, but questionable defensive units led the Alouettes to defeat versus the Edmonton Eskimos each time.

The team was purchased in 1954 by Ted Workman. Like all teams playing in the WIFU and IRFU, the Alouettes joined the newly-formed Canadian Football League in 1958. While the team continued to enjoy success for the rest of the 1950s, that all changed at the end of the 1960 season. To be more specific, the team was shaken by an announcement on November 10 – namely the trade of Hal Patterson and Sam Etcheverry to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats for Bernie Faloney and Don Paquette. Workman had concluded the deal without consulting with general manager Perry Moss. The deal quickly fell apart because Etcheverry had just signed a new contract with a no-trade clause; as a result, Etcheverry was now a free agent. The deal was reworked and Patterson was traded for Paquette. Sam Etcheverry went on to play in the NFL with the St. Louis Cardinals for 2 years (1961 and 1962) followed by the San Francisco 49ers in 1963. Faloney remained in Hamilton, and teamed with Patterson to form one of the most deadly quarterback-receiver combinations in CFL history.

This episode remains one of the most lopsided trades ever made in the Alouettes history, and it ushered in a dark decade for the team. During that time, they failed to register a single winning season. From 1968 to 1976 the team played in the Autostade stadium—which had been built as a temporary stadium for Expo 67. The stadium&#x27;s less-than-desirable location on Montreal&#x27;s waterfront near the Victoria Bridge led to dismal attendance, putting more strain on the team&#x27;s finances. 

Workman sold half the team to Joe Atwell in 1965. Atwell bought the remaining shares in 1967. The change in ownership failed to reverse the Als&#x27; slide. They finally bottomed out in 1969, finishing 2–12. After that season, Atwell sold the team to the highly capable Sam Berger, a former part-owner of the Ottawa Rough Riders. Berger made immediate changes to the team. On December 9, the team announced that Red O&#x27;Quinn and Sam Etcheverry were returning to the organization, this time as the team&#x27;s new general manager and head coach, respectively. The team also unveiled new uniforms—their home jerseys were now predominantly green, with red and white trim. The white helmets with the red &quot;wings&quot; used during the 1960s also disappeared, replaced by a white helmet with a stylized green and red bird&#x27;s head that formed a lower-case &quot;a.&quot; As one might expect from a team that had won only two games in 1969, many new players were brought in.

The changes paid immediate dividends. Although the team finished third in the East, they defeated the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the playoffs. The 1970 season culminated when the Alouettes won the 58th Grey Cup, played on November 28 at Toronto&#x27;s Exhibition Stadium before a crowd of 32,669. Led by quarterback Sonny Wade (who was named the game&#x27;s most valuable player, and who would soon become a fan favourite in Montreal—not unlike the status his coach had enjoyed in the 1950s), halfback Moses Denson, receivers Gary Lefebvre and Tom Pullen, along with kicker George Springate, the team defeated the Calgary Stampeders 23–10 for the city&#x27;s first Grey Cup since 1949, also against the Stamps.

That 1970 victory would herald the beginning of arguably the greatest decade in franchise history. During Berger&#x27;s tenure as owner, the team played for six Grey Cups and won three (meeting both Alberta teams all of those times, and the Edmonton Eskimos in five of those six games). In 1974, the team changed their colours to match the other Montreal pro sports teams- red, white and blue. They finally moved out of the Autostade and into Olympic Stadium midway through the 1976 season and attendance shot up. In 1977, the Als had a very successful year both on the field and at the box office, winning the Grey Cup at their home field before a Grey Cup-record 68,318 fans (a CFL record that still stands as of 2023). They also averaged 59,595 fans per game at the &quot;Big O&quot; during the regular season, a league record that also still stands.

However, the success ended with Berger&#x27;s retirement in 1981. He sold the team to Vancouver businessman Nelson Skalbania. The flamboyant Skalbania set about signing two first-round picks from the 1981 National Football League draft and NFL name players such as Vince Ferragamo, James Scott, David Overstreet, Keith Gary and Billy &quot;White Shoes&quot; Johnson. Even with all that talent, the Alouettes suffered on the field, finishing with a dismal 3–13 record while attendance plummeted to under 30,000 per game. However, the East was so weak that year (Hamilton was the only team in the East to finish with a winning record) that they actually made the playoffs, finishing third in the East ahead of the 2–14 Toronto Argonauts. In the East Semi-Final, they made a fairly good showing against the second-place (and eventual East Division champions) Rough Riders before losing by a final score of 20–16.

This would be the last game that the original Alouettes franchise would play. Skalbania was reported late in 1981 to be selling to oil magnate Pat Bowlen, who would later buy the NFL&#x27;s Denver Broncos in 1984. Later in 1981, NFL coach George Allen obtained an option to purchase 51% of the club, and was named Alouettes&#x27; president. While holding both the option and the post, Allen was surprised by Skalbania arranging a sale of the same controlling stake to Harry Ornest, who would later own the St. Louis Blues and the Toronto Argonauts. Ornest was reluctant to take control of the Alouettes as a result of the team&#x27;s high level of debt and extensive commitments to high-profile stars. In early April 1982, Allen looked set to take control of the Alouettes. However, Allen left the club in late April after Skalbania was unable to resolve 1981 debts. With the franchise in collapse, Berger tried to force Skalbania to relinquish the team to him as payment for debt. Skalbania returned from a business trip to Hong Kong in late April and was able to regain control of the team. However, Skalbania&#x27;s highly leveraged business interests collapsed a month later. Unable to meet his obligations, he was forced to return the team to the league on May 13.

=== Montreal Concordes (1982–1985) ===
The CFL had anticipated the collapse of the Alouettes, and was well prepared when Skalbania returned the franchise to the league. Among potential suitors for the troubled franchise was Montreal businessman Charles Bronfman, founder and owner of the Alouettes&#x27; co-tenants at the Big O, the Montreal Expos. Bronfman had made it clear to league officials that he would not deal with Skalbania, but would be willing to establish a replacement franchise on short notice if the Alouettes ceased operations. On May 14, 1982, a day after the original Alouettes franchise folded, the CFL granted the Montreal franchise rights to Bronfman. However, Skalbania continued to assert ownership of the Montreal Alouettes name, logos and related intellectual property even though he had given up the franchise.

Rather than risk a lawsuit from the notoriously litigious Skalbania, and unwilling to negotiate with him, Bronfman chose to operate his team under another aviation-inspired name, the Concordes. The new name was not only a reference to the then-revolutionary Concorde supersonic passenger jet, but appeared to be an appeal to both anglophones and francophones, Concorde was an Anglo-French joint venture. Unfortunately, the new name angered management at one of Montreal&#x27;s most prominent corporations, aviation manufacturer Bombardier. After being a prominent sponsor of the Alouettes, Bombardier refused to have anything to do with a football team named for an aircraft built by one of its competitors, the French-based Aérospatiale.

The Concordes inherited the franchise history and records of the 1946–1981 Alouettes, as well as the CFL rights of all Alouettes players. Bronfman retained most of the Alouettes&#x27; coaching staff, including recently hired head coach Joe Galat, and most of the Alouettes&#x27; front office personnel. In an effort to bring the team&#x27;s expenses under control, Bronfmam released the former NFL players signed by Skalbania. While many players returned to the U.S., one factor working in Bronfman&#x27;s favour was that a players&#x27; strike was looming in the NFL (which would last 57 days from September to November), which helped persuade star quarterback Johnny Evans and a few other Skalbania signees to stay in Montreal.

A nine-game losing streak to end the season doomed the 1982 Concordes to a 2–14 record – the worst record in franchise history (percentage points below the 1969 Als). The Concordes featured quarterback Luc Tousignant, the only Québécois quarterback to start a CFL game besides Gerry Dattilio. The club also featured star collegiate running back David Overstreet (a holdover from the 1981 Alouettes) who rushed for 190 yards in six games before ending his season on the injured reserve list. Other stars on the club included quarterback Johnny Evans, quarterback Turner Gill, slot back Nick Arakgi, running back Lester Brown, wide receiver Brian DeRoo, local kick returner Denny Ferdinand, defensive tackle Glen Weir, safety Preston Young, defensive end Gordon Judges, kicker-punter Don Sweet, and linebacker William Hampton.

The team slowly rebounded on the field over the next three years. The Concordes won five games in 1983. While still well below .500, the East Division was so weak that year (only the eventual Grey Cup champion Argos finished with a winning record) that the Concordes were still in playoff contention on the season&#x27;s final weekend. The Concordes&#x27; final game of the season was at Olympic Stadium against the Tiger-Cats. With Hamilton and Montreal tied at 5–10 for the division&#x27;s third and final playoff spot, a respectable crowd of 41,157 converged to watch the Concordes play what was effectively a playoff game. These fans left heartbroken after Hamilton kicker Bernie Ruoff made a last minute field goal to tie the game 21–21. Since overtime would not be introduced in the CFL regular season until 1986, the Tiger-Cats won the final Eastern playoff berth on account of a better head-to-head record (having beaten the Concordes earlier in the year).

The team returned to the playoffs in 1984, again doing so in a very weak East Division; only the defending champion Argos finished with a winning record. In 1985, they advanced all the way to the East Final. Their East Semifinal win over Ottawa that year was both their only home playoff game and only playoff win under the Concordes banner; 1984 and 1985 were the only playoff appearances for the franchise from 1982 to 1986. However, as in 1984, they made the playoffs in an extremely weak East Division; the Concordes and Ti-Cats both finished with identical 8–8 records, with the Ti-Cats getting the division title by virtue of sweeping the season series. No other team in the division even managed a .500 record.

However, attendance did not keep pace with the team&#x27;s performance. The Concordes&#x27; 1983 season finale against Hamilton was the only game to attract a crowd surpassing even 30,000 under Bronfman&#x27;s ownership. Moreover, the 1985 East Semifinal was a disaster at the box office due in part to poor weather conditions and haphazard facility preparations. Only 11,372 fans attended what would turn out to be the team&#x27;s last home game played under the Concordes name.

=== Re-branding and demise (1986–1987) ===
After quietly coming to terms with Skalbania, in 1986 the team attempted to embrace its predecessor&#x27;s history and regenerate flagging fan interest by rebranding itself the &quot;new&quot; Montreal Alouettes. This would not prove to be successful, on or off the field. On the field, the team posted a 4–14 record, missing the playoffs in spite of once again finishing third in the East on account of the new &quot;cross-over rule&quot; the CFL had implemented for the 1986 season. Off the field, financial losses mounted and the team&#x27;s attendance tumbled to 10,127 a game, including only 9,045 at the final home game (a contest against the BC Lions drew only 5200 fans, the smallest crowd at any CFL game since 1951).

Just before the 1987 season, Carling O&#x27;Keefe tore up its deal to serve as the CFL&#x27;s presenting television sponsor. The collapse of the CFL&#x27;s television deal proved a death blow for the Alouettes. The franchise had lost at least $15 million under Bronfman&#x27;s ownership. While Bronfman was far better financed than Skalbania, he was unwilling to spend millions of dollars underwriting his professional sports holdings indefinitely. Bronfman&#x27;s overall situation was not helped by the then-emerging news that his other professional sports team, the Expos, were at the centre of a massive collusion scandal that was rocking Major League Baseball. Eventually, Bronfman decided to focus on the Expos and made it clear he would not field a football team for the 1987 CFL season unless the Alouettes sold thousands of additional season tickets. Neither the necessary season ticket sales nor a viable ownership group willing to take the franchise off Bronfman&#x27;s hands materialized.

With the collapse of the league&#x27;s television deal leaving several other franchises in serious distress, the league was not in a position to take over operating the team. Re-location was not an option either even though several Canadian cities had expressed interest in acquiring a CFL team (with London, Ontario being briefly considered). Even notwithstanding the logistical challenges of moving a team on short notice, no prospective city had a stadium that was suitable even for temporary use. At the time, the CFL was lukewarm to the possibility of expanding or re-locating to U.S. markets (the CFL&#x27;s U.S. expansion experiment did not come until six years later).

The Alouettes played both of their two preseason games on the road. However, Bronfman was at the end of his tether and folded the new Alouettes on June 24, 1987, just a day before the 1987 regular season started. The league had been well-aware of this possibility for months, and immediately released a previously-drafted eight-team schedule. However, the Alouettes&#x27; demise came so late that the June 28 &quot;Washington Post&quot; still announced an ESPN broadcast of an Alouettes–Stampeders game, a game that would never be played. To balance out the divisions, the easternmost-West Division team, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, moved to the East Division to take the Alouettes&#x27; place (along with this, the &quot;cross-over rule&quot; for the playoffs was scrapped until 1997).

The CFL held a dispersal draft for the Alouettes players. Some of the players left out of work by the team&#x27;s demise (both on the Alouettes and players on other CFL teams who were cut to make room for former Alouettes) played in the NFL as replacement players during another players&#x27; strike later that year. During the period that the Alouettes were inactive, professional gridiron football would return to Montreal in the form of the NFL-created World League of American Football&#x27;s Montreal Machine, who played two seasons in 1991 and 1992 under American rules.

===Baltimore Stallions (1994–1995)===

The Baltimore Football Club was granted an expansion franchise for 1994 by the Canadian Football League during their American expansion of the early-mid 1990s. After the NFL&#x27;s Indianapolis Colts (who had moved from Baltimore in 1983) blocked attempts to name the new team the &quot;Baltimore CFL Colts,&quot; owner Jim Speros eventually settled on &quot;Stallions&quot; as a nickname. The Stallions were by far the most successful of the CFL&#x27;s American teams, garnering strong fan support in the Baltimore area and appearing in the Grey Cup in both its seasons, losing in 1994 and winning in 1995. To date, they are the only American-based team to play for and win the Grey Cup. Only a week before the Stallions won the Grey Cup, Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell announced his intention to relocate his NFL club to Baltimore. Support for the Stallions dried up almost overnight. With no reasonable prospect of successfully competing with an NFL team, and unwilling to have his club effectively reduced to &quot;minor-league&quot; status in Baltimore, Speros decided to move the Stallions elsewhere.

At one point, Speros was very close to moving the team to Houston, Texas. Although Houston at the time was still home to the NFL&#x27;s Oilers, fan support for that team had collapsed due their pending relocation to Nashville (to later become the Titans). Speros had reason to believe a CFL team there could repeat the success that had been enjoyed in Baltimore. In addition, a team in Houston would have been natural rivals for the San Antonio Texans, who were still planning to play the 1996 season had at least one other U.S. team survived. On the other hand, the proposed move to Houston was considered in some circles to be little more than a ploy to win concessions from the NFL, which presumably would not have wanted to risk the embarrassment of having one of its teams outdrawn by a team from another league in the same city. The NFL would return to Houston in 2002 in the form of the Texans.

In the end, under prodding from league commissioner and former Alouettes running back Larry Smith, Speros began talks with Montreal. Smith had been looking for a way to return the CFL to Canada&#x27;s second-largest market and, at the same time, find a way out of the failing American expansion (which Smith had also presided over). He believed that the defending Grey Cup champions would be a better vehicle for reviving football in Montreal than what would have effectively been an expansion team.

At a league meeting on February 2, 1996; Speros formally requested permission to move the Stallions to Montreal. The request was granted, officially ending the CFL&#x27;s American experiment. However, talks had been so far advanced that at least one Baltimore outlet reported that the Stallions were moving to Montreal in January. According to at least one Canadian outlet, at the same time Speros had already begun deciding whether to retain the Stallions moniker or &quot;revive&quot; the Alouettes. He ultimately chose the latter course, reconstituting his organisation as the third incarnation of the Alouettes. While Speros was able to reclaim the history of the 1946–86 Alouettes/Concordes franchise, he was not allowed to retain the history of the Stallions. As a result, according to official CFL records, Speros is now reckoned as having surrendered the Stallions franchise before &quot;reactivating&quot; the Alouettes franchise. The Alouettes are now retconned as having suspended operations from 1987 to 1995, while the Stallions are officially one of only three modern-era Grey Cup champions to fold (after the Rough Riders and the original Alouettes). The Alouettes, however, do briefly mention the Stallions on their history page.
While all of the Stallions players were released from their contracts, general manager Jim Popp, who followed the team from Baltimore, was able to re-sign many of them. However, as with all the other U.S.-based CFL teams, the Stallions had been exempt from CFL rules that mandated a certain quota of Canadian &quot;non-import&quot; players on team rosters. For this reason, an expansion draft was held to help stock the Alouettes with the required number of Canadian players. Popp hired former Stallions assistant coach Bob Price to be the new head coach of the revived Alouettes. With the help of much of the core of the Stallions, the Alouettes were able to overcome a slow start to finish with their first winning record since 1979. They defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the East semifinal before being defeated by the Argos 43–7 in the East Final.

In 1997, Speros sold the team to developer and investor Robert Wetenhall, who owned the team until he officially transferred ownership to the league on May 31, 2019. Smith stepped down as league commissioner and became president of the Alouettes. Bob Price left the Alouettes to head south and coach in the NCAA. Popp hired former B.C. Lions head coach and Concordes defensive line coach Dave Ritchie as his successor.

=== Rebirth of the Montreal Alouettes (1996–1997) ===
The revived Alouettes franchise played their first two seasons at Olympic Stadium, but attendance in the cavernous domed stadium was very poor at first. The future of the franchise was very much in doubt until a twist of fate revitalized the floundering club. When a scheduled November 1997 U2 concert at Olympic Stadium conflicted with an unexpected home playoff game against the Lions (due to the CFL&#x27;s recently re-established &#x27;cross-over&#x27; playoff rule), the team decided to move the game to Molson Stadium, where they had played from 1954 to 1967. Interest in the team soared and the game was sold out, prompting the team to relocate permanently to the smaller venue beginning with the 1998 season. At the time of the Alouettes&#x27; return to Molson, the stadium&#x27;s capacity was 20,202. Prior to every Sunday home game, the club plays &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; over the PA system in tribute to the unintended role U2 played in saving the franchise. The team did not completely abandon the Olympic Stadium, and used it for one home game per year, from 2001 to 2009, and playoff games from 2001–2012. The Montreal Alouettes got off to a good start, winning 25 games and losing 11 in their first two seasons, and reaching the East Division Finals both times.

=== Anthony Calvillo era (1998–2013) ===
The fortunes for the Alouettes started to change during the 1998 season, when they acquired a young free agent quarterback from the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Anthony Calvillo, and they drafted slotback Ben Cahoon. Tracy Ham and Mike Pringle led the team to a second-place finish, but they suffered a last-second loss to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the East Final. The Alouettes finally broke through in 1999, under new head coach Charlie Taaffe, winning their first division title since 1979. However, for the fourth consecutive season they lost the East Final match in a close game against the Tiger-Cats, 27–26.

Tracy Ham retired after the 1999 season, and Anthony Calvillo took over as the full-time starting quarterback, he led the team to their first Grey Cup final since 1979, losing to BC in a close game, as they came within a missed two point convert of sending the game into overtime. After the season Charlie Taaffe resigned to become the head coach of the Maryland Terrapins. The next season started under new coach Rod Rust at 9–2, but after Calvillo separated his shoulder, the team started struggling and after losing all their remaining games, GM Jim Popp fired Rust, led them into the playoffs, where they lost to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the East Semi-Final.

During the off-season, the Alouettes signed Don Matthews to lead the team in the future. They came all the way back in 2002, finishing with the best record (13–5) in the CFL and winning their first Grey Cup since 1977, by defeating one of their oldest rivals, and Matthews&#x27; former team, the Edmonton Eskimos, 25–16. The Alouettes had the best record in the CFL during the 2004 season at 14–4 and looked liked a sure bet to play for the Grey Cup, but in the East Final, Anthony Calvillo got hurt, and was replaced by backup Ted White, and the Toronto Argonauts rallied to defeat the Alouettes, 26–18. During the 2004–2005 off-season, all time CFL career rushing yards leader Mike Pringle signed a one-day contract, so he could retire as a member of the Montreal Alouettes. The team participated in the first Grey Cup overtime game in almost 50 years. The Edmonton Eskimos defeated the Alouettes, 38–35.

During the 2006 season Matthews left his position as head coach near the end of the season because of health reasons, and Jim Popp took over for the rest of the season, leading the team to the Grey Cup, where they lost 25–14 to the B.C Lions.

Popp stayed on to coach the team during the 2007 season, and the team suffered its first losing season since coming back to Montreal in 1996, with an 8–10 record, hindered by the loss of starting quarterback Anthony Calvillo, who left the team near the end of the season to be with his wife who was sick. The team lost the East Semi-Final, 24–22, to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers with backup quarterback Marcus Brady behind center. With Montreal hosting the 2008 Grey Cup, the Alouettes wanted to be there, so they hired an experienced NFL assistant coach in Marc Trestman, and head coach Trestman helped lead them to an 11–7 record and a berth in the Grey Cup against the visiting Calgary Stampeders led by Henry Burris. The Stampeders defeated the hometown Montreal Alouettes, 22–14, in front of over 66,000 fans.

The 2009 season was a record breaking season for the Montreal Alouettes, as they set a team record for wins in a regular season, were a CFL best 15–3, and their defence was amazing, as they allowed only 324 points, second least in an 18-game season. Marc Trestman won the coach of the year. The Alouettes earned a 28–27 comeback victory in the 2009 Grey Cup, thanks to the great play of Anthony Calvillo, Ben Cahoon, and Jamel Richardson. The Alouettes trailed the Saskatchewan Roughriders, 27–11, with 8 minutes to play in the game, when they started their comeback. It all came down to the foot of field goal kicker Damon Duval, who after missing a 43-yard field on the last play, got a second chance, when the Roughriders were called for having too many players on the field (The 13th Man), which was a ten-yard penalty, so kicking from the 33 yard line, Duval nailed it through the uprights, giving Montreal an improbable Grey Cup victory, after trailing the entire game. The game turned into a Grey Cup classic, thanks to the great play of the Alouettes veterans, and broke a streak of 4 straight losses in Grey Cups. The 2010 season was another good season for Montreal, as they went 12–6 and became the first team since the 1997 Toronto Argonauts to repeat as Grey Cup Champions. They played against the Saskatchewan Roughriders for the second straight year, and won the game, 21–18, repeating as champs.

The 2011 season was another record breaking year for Anthony Calvillo, as he broke numerous records, all against the Argonauts. During their first meeting Calvillo broke the CFL all time touchdown passes record of 394 TD passes on a pass to Eric Deslauriers, Damon Allen was at the game at Molson Stadium and personally congratulated him on breaking his record. He tied Allen&#x27;s record in Regina the week before with the only touchdown pass ever caught by Tim Maypray. During the teams&#x27; second meeting, he broke the completions record with a completion to Brandon London. In the teams&#x27; third meeting, Anthony Calvillo became pro football&#x27;s all-time career passing yards leader, on a Jamel Richardson touchdown pass to end the third quarter. The play was stopped as his family joined him along with Mark Cohan for a special on field presentation and video tribute. NFL greats Warren Moon and Dan Marino, ESPN&#x27;s Chris Berman, and Damon Allen each sent video messages congratulating him on breaking the record. Calvillo was presented with a special plaque, with the number 72382, the new pro football all-time yardage mark. The team lost an overtime thriller in the East Semi-Final at the Olympic Stadium 52–44 to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

The 2012 season was another good year for the Alouettes; however, after an 11–7 season, they lost the East final to the Toronto Argonauts after Brian Bratton dropped a game-tying touchdown pass from Calvillo with a minute left in the game, giving Toronto a 27–20 win.

Before the 2013 season, coach Marc Trestman left the Alouettes for the NFL, becoming the head coach of the Chicago Bears. Dan Hawkins, who had no pro experience, was hired as head coach. After starting the season with a 2–3 record, Jim Popp fired Hawkins, and coached the team for the rest of the year. Calvillo suffered a season-ending concussion in Saskatchewan on a hit by Ricky Foley. Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith, Tanner Marsh and Josh Neiswander played at quarterback for the Alouettes for the remainder of the season. The team had an 8–10 record, and made the playoffs for an 18th straight year. They lost the East Semi-Final against the Tiger-Cats.

Anthony Calvillo announced his retirement on January 21, after a 20-year career, including the last 16 with the Alouettes.

=== Post-Anthony Calvillo era (2014–2018) ===

On February 24, 2014, the Alouettes named former Edmonton Eskimos and Calgary Stampeders coach Tom Higgins as the 21st head coach in franchise history. Higgins coached the Eskimos against the Alouettes in both the 90th and 91st Grey Cup games. The Alouettes finished with a .500 record, qualifying for the playoffs. After dismantling the BC Lions in a crossover match the Alouettes were beaten by the Tiger-Cats 40–24.

On May 22, 2015, Michael Sam signed a two-year contract with the Alouettes. The signing made him the first openly gay player in the CFL&#x27;s history. However, Michael Sam left after one game. On August 21, 2015, owner Robert Wettenhall announced he had relieved Tom Higgins of his head coaching responsibilities and that general manager Jim Popp would take over the duties of head coach. The 2015 season was a difficult one for the Alouettes, due to injuries to starting QB Jonathan Crompton, the Alouettes went through five different quarterbacks including two rookies Rakeem Cato, and Brandon Bridge, before trading for veteran Kevin Glenn. By that time the quarterback shuffle had taken its toll on the team and they finished the year with a 6–12 record and missed the playoffs for the first time since both 1986 and their 1996 re-activation, their last year before folding on the eve of the 1987 season.

The following season on September 19, 2016, Popp was relieved of his coaching duties, while remaining as the team&#x27;s general manager. Jacques Chapdelaine was named interim head coach, becoming the first Quebec-born head coach in Alouettes&#x27; history. He was named the permanent coach on December 13, 2016. Kavis Reed took over duties as the team&#x27;s new general manager. 2016 was also another dismal year for the team, finishing with another losing record of 7–11. After a 3–8 start to the 2017 season, Chapdelaine was fired on September 13, 2017. The Alouettes ended the season with their worst record since reactivation, 3–15.

On December 20, 2017, former Green Bay Packers head coach Mike Sherman was named the team&#x27;s new head coach. Under Sherman the team suffered its fourth consecutive losing season, finishing the year with 5 wins and 13 losses. In the five seasons following Anthony Calvillo&#x27;s retirement, the team won 30 games and lost 60.

=== Spiegel and Stern ownership, rebranding (2019–2023)===
On February 1, 2019, the team unveiled a new logo and updated uniforms, designed by GRDN Studio, replacing the previous &quot;angry bird&quot; logo used since the team&#x27;s reestablishment in 1996 with a stylized &quot;M&quot;, designed to resemble a bird and plane, and introducing a new &quot;MontreALS&quot; tagline, playing upon the team&#x27;s nickname. The team also partnered with Vice Media on aspects of accompanying marketing and content.

On May 31, 2019, Wetenhall surrendered his ownership of the Alouettes to the league, after having attempted to pursue a sale. The CFL would operate the team on its behalf while it searched for a new owner. Several prospective suitors for the team included Clifford Starke, a 35-year-old entrepreneur in medical cannabis who is friends with former Alouette player and CFL commissioner Larry Smith, who had been negotiating for a majority stake. Also interested was former Alouettes running back Eric Lapointe, whose 2017 bid had been rejected but had maintained interest in buying the team (though he withdrew in April 2019), and Vincenzo Guzzo, CEO of Quebec&#x27;s Cinémas Guzzo cinema chain. As of early June of that year, CFL sources indicated it would not accept Starke&#x27;s bid, while Guzzo&#x27;s was said to be on hold. Guzzo later stated that he was displeased with the state of the Alouettes organization as a business and that, had he not been a Montreal resident, he would have never considered buying the team.

On June 8, two days after their last pre-season game, and just six days before their 2019 season opener, Khari Jones took over from Mike Sherman as interim head coach. Jones guided the Alouettes to a 10–8 record, good for a second-place finish in the East Division, and the team&#x27;s first playoff berth since 2014. The Alouettes improved play during that season was also attributable to the performance of their quarterback Vernon Adams who passed for almost 4,000 yards. Although the team lost in the East Semi-Final to the crossover Edmonton Eskimos 37–29, the team removed the interim tag from Jones&#x27; head coach title, and he was signed to a three-year extension on November 26, 2019. 

On January 6, 2020, after almost a year of being owned by the league, the Alouettes found new ownership in Crawford Steel&#x27;s Sid Spiegel and his son-in-law Gary Stern, whose holding company S and S Sportsco would oversee the team. Spiegel died on July 28, 2021, before being able to see the team he bought play a game (the 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic); in effect, the team was controlled by his estate. On August 29, 2022 Gary Stern announced that he was stepping away from day-to-day operations with the club and resigning from his role with the Canadian Football League&#x27;s board of governors, effective immediately.

=== Pierre Karl Péladeau ownership era (2023–present) ===
On February 14, 2023, the ownership of the Alouettes was transferred back to the CFL. Mario Cecchini was appointed as the interim President while the league sought to finalize a sale to new ownership. On March 10, 2023, the CFL announced that Pierre Karl Péladeau had purchased the team. On March 28, 2023, Pierre Karl Péladeau announced they had hired Mark Weightman as president and CEO of the team. The 2023 season saw the Alouettes go 11–7, finishing second in the east division, and upsetting the heavily favoured Toronto Argonauts to win the East Division Final, and then win the Grey Cup in a 28-24 upset against the heavily favoured Winnipeg Blue Bombers.

<text>Jacques Cartier (; 31 December 14911 September 1557) was a French maritime explorer from Brittany. Jacques Cartier was the first European to describe and map the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the shores of the Saint Lawrence River, which he named &quot;The Country of Canadas&quot; after the Iroquoian names for the two big settlements he saw at Stadacona (Quebec City) and at Hochelaga (Montreal Island).

==Early life==
Jacques Cartier was born in 1491 in Saint-Malo, the port on the north-east coast of Brittany. Cartier, who was a respectable mariner, improved his social status in 1520 by marrying Mary Catherine des Granches, member of a leading aristocratic family. His good name in Saint-Malo is recognized by its frequent appearance in baptismal registers as godfather or witness.

==First voyage (1534)==
In 1534, two years after the Duchy of Brittany was formally united with the French crown in the Edict of Union, Cartier was introduced to King Francis I by Jean Le Veneur, bishop of Saint-Malo and abbot of Mont Saint-Michel, at the Manoir de Brion. The King had previously invited (although not formally commissioned) the Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano to explore the eastern coast of North America on behalf of France in 1524. Le Veneur cited voyages to Newfoundland and Brazil as proof of Cartier&#x27;s ability to &quot;lead ships to the discovery of new lands in the New World&quot;.

On April 20, 1534, Cartier set sail under a commission from the king, hoping to discover a western passage to the wealthy markets of the East Indies. In the words of the commission, he was to &quot;discover certain islands and lands where it is said that a great quantity of gold and other precious things are to be found&quot;.

It took him twenty days to sail across the ocean. Starting on May 10 of that year, he explored parts of Newfoundland, the Strait of Belle Isle and southern shore of the Labrador Peninsula, the Gaspé and North Shore coastlines on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and some parts of the coasts of the Gulf&#x27;s main islands, including Prince Edward Island, Anticosti Island and the Magdalen Islands. During one stop at Îles aux Oiseaux (Islands of the Birds, now the Rochers-aux-Oiseaux federal bird sanctuary, northeast of Brion Island in the Magdalen Islands), his crew slaughtered around 1000 birds, most of them great auks (extinct since 1852). Cartier&#x27;s first two encounters with aboriginal peoples in Canada on the north side of Chaleur Bay, most likely the Mi&#x27;kmaq, were brief; some trading occurred.

His third encounter took place on the shores of Gaspé Bay with a party of St. Lawrence Iroquoians, where on July 24 he planted a cross to claim the land for France. The 10-metre cross bearing the words &quot;Long Live the King of France&quot; claimed possession of the territory in the King&#x27;s name. The change in mood was a clear indication that the Iroquoians understood Cartier&#x27;s actions. Here he kidnapped the two sons of their chief, Donnacona. Cartier wrote that they later told him this region where they were captured (Gaspé) was called by them &quot;Honguedo&quot;. The natives&#x27; chief at last agreed that they could be taken, under the condition that they return with European goods to trade.

Cartier returned to France in September 1534, sure that he had reached an Asian land.

==Second voyage (1535–1536)==

Jacques Cartier set sail for a second voyage on May 19 of the following year with three ships, 110 men, and his two Iroquoian captives. Reaching the St. Lawrence, he sailed upriver for the first time, and reached the Iroquoian capital of Stadacona, where Chief Donnacona ruled. Cartier claimed a land near St. Lawrence River in 1534; but France paid little attention to the colony for 60 years. Not until King Henry IV sent Samuel de Champlain in 1608 to New France as its governor and built a permanent settlement and a fur-trading post called Quebec.

Cartier left his main ships in a harbour close to Stadacona, and used his smallest ship to continue on to Hochelaga (now Montreal), arriving on October 2, 1535. Hochelaga was far more impressive than the small and squalid village of Stadacona, and a crowd of over a thousand came to the river&#x27;s edge to greet the Frenchmen. The site of their arrival has been confidently identified as the beginning of the Sainte-Marie Sault – where the bridge named after him now stands. The expedition could proceed no further, as the river was blocked by rapids. So certain was Cartier that the river was the Northwest Passage, and that the rapids were all that was preventing him from sailing to China, that the rapids and the town that eventually grew near them came to be named after the French word for China, &quot;La Chine&quot;: the Lachine Rapids and the town of Lachine, Quebec.

After spending two days among the people of Hochelaga, Cartier returned to Stadacona on October 11. It is not known exactly when he decided to spend the winter of 1535–1536 in Stadacona, and it was by then too late to return to France. Cartier and his men prepared for the winter by strengthening their fort, stacking firewood, and salting down game and fish.

From mid-November 1535 to mid-April 1536, the French fleet lay frozen solid at the mouth of the St. Charles River, under the Rock of Quebec. Ice was over a fathom (1.8 m) thick on the river, with snow four feet (1.2 m) deep ashore. To add to the misery, scurvy broke out – first among the Iroquoians, and then among the French. Cartier estimated the number of dead Iroquoians at 50. On a visit by Domagaya to the French fort, Cartier inquired and learned from him that a concoction made from a tree known as annedda, probably Spruce beer, or &quot;arbor vitae&quot;, would cure scurvy. This remedy likely saved the expedition from destruction, allowing 85 Frenchmen to survive the winter. In his journal, Cartier states that by mid-February, &quot;out of 110 that we were, not ten were well enough to help the others, a pitiful thing to see&quot;. The Frenchmen used up the bark of an entire tree in a week on the cure, and the dramatic results prompted Cartier to proclaim it a Godsend, and a miracle.

Ready to return to France in early May 1536, Cartier decided to kidnap Chief Donnacona and take him to France, so that he might personally tell the tale of a country further north, called the &quot;Kingdom of Saguenay&quot;, said to be full of gold, rubies and other treasures. After an arduous trip down the St. Lawrence and a three-week Atlantic crossing, Cartier and his men arrived in Saint-Malo on July 15, 1536, concluding the second, 14-month voyage, which was to be Cartier&#x27;s most profitable.

==Third voyage (1541–1542)==

On October 17, 1540, Francis ordered the navigator Jacques Cartier to return to Canada to lend weight to a colonization project of which he would be &quot;captain general&quot;. However, January 15, 1541, saw Cartier supplanted by Jean-François de La Rocque de Roberval, a Huguenot courtier and friend of the king named as the first lieutenant general of French Canada. Roberval was to lead the expedition, with Cartier as his chief navigator. While Roberval waited for artillery and supplies, he gave permission to Cartier to sail on ahead with his ships.

On May 23, 1541, Cartier departed Saint-Malo on his third voyage with five ships. This time, any thought of finding a passage to the Orient was forgotten. The goals were now to find the &quot;Kingdom of Saguenay&quot; and its riches, and to establish a permanent settlement along the St. Lawrence River.

Anchoring at Stadacona, Cartier again met the Iroquoians, but found their &quot;show of joy&quot; and their numbers worrisome, and decided not to build his settlement there. Sailing a few kilometres upriver to a spot he had previously observed, he decided to settle on the site of present-day Cap-Rouge, Quebec. The convicts and other colonists were landed, the cattle that had survived three months aboard ship were turned loose, earth was broken for a kitchen garden, and seeds of cabbage, turnip, and lettuce were planted. A fortified settlement was thus created and was named Charlesbourg-Royal. Another fort was also built on the cliff overlooking the settlement, for added protection.

The men also began collecting what they believed to be diamonds and gold, but which upon return to France were discovered to be merely quartz crystals and iron pyrites, respectively—which gave rise to a French expression: &quot;faux comme les diamants du Canada&quot; (&quot;As false as Canadian diamonds&quot;). Two of the ships were sent on their journey home with some of these minerals on September 2.

Having set tasks for everyone, Cartier left with the longboats for a reconnaissance in search of &quot;Saguenay&quot; on September 7. Having reached Hochelaga, he was prevented by bad weather and the numerous rapids from continuing up to the Ottawa River.

Returning to Charlesbourg-Royal, Cartier found the situation ominous. The Iroquoians no longer made friendly visits or peddled fish and game, but prowled about in a sinister manner. No records exist about the winter of 1541–1542 and the information must be gleaned from the few details provided by returning sailors. It seems the natives attacked and killed about 35 settlers before the Frenchmen could retreat behind their fortifications. Even though scurvy was cured through the native remedy (Thuja occidentalis infusion), the impression left is of a general misery, and of Cartier&#x27;s growing conviction that he had insufficient manpower either to protect his base or to go in search of the Saguenay Kingdom.

Cartier left for France in early June 1542, encountering Roberval and his ships along the Newfoundland coast, at about the time Roberval marooned Marguerite de La Rocque. Despite Roberval&#x27;s insistence that he accompany him back to Saguenay, Cartier slipped off under the cover of darkness and continued on to France, still convinced his vessels contained a wealth of gold and diamonds. He arrived there in October, in what proved to be his last voyage. Meanwhile, Roberval took command at Charlesbourg-Royal, but it was abandoned in 1543 after disease, foul weather and hostile natives drove the would-be settlers to despair.

==Later life==
Cartier spent the rest of his life in Saint-Malo and his nearby estate, where he often was useful as an interpreter in Portuguese. He died at age 65 on September 1, 1557, during an epidemic, possibly of typhus, though many sources list his cause of death as unknown. Cartier is interred in Saint-Malo Cathedral.

No permanent European settlements were made in Canada before 1605, when Pierre Dugua, with Samuel Champlain, founded Port Royal in Acadia.

==Legacy==
Having already located the entrance to the St. Lawrence on his first voyage, he now opened up the greatest waterway for the European penetration of North America. He produced an intelligent estimate of the resources of Canada, both natural and human, albeit with a considerable exaggeration of its mineral wealth. While some of his actions toward the St. Lawrence Iroquoians were dishonourable, he did try at times to establish friendship with them and other native peoples living along the St. Lawrence River—an indispensable preliminary to French settlement in their lands.

Cartier was the first to document the name Canada to designate the territory on the shores of the St-Lawrence River. The name is derived from the Huron–Iroquois word , or village, which was incorrectly interpreted as the native term for the newly discovered land. Cartier used the name to describe Stadacona, the surrounding land and the river itself. And Cartier named the inhabitants (Iroquoians) he had seen there. Thereafter the name Canada was used to designate the small French colony on these shores, and the French colonists were called until the mid-nineteenth century, when the name started to be applied to the loyalist colonies on the Great Lakes and later to all of British North America. In this way Cartier is not strictly the European discoverer of Canada as this country is understood today, a vast federation stretching (from sea to sea). Eastern parts had previously been visited by the Norse, as well as Basque, Galician and Breton fishermen, and perhaps the Corte-Real brothers and John Cabot (in addition of course to the natives who first inhabited the territory). Cartier&#x27;s particular contribution to the discovery of Canada is as the first European to penetrate the continent, and more precisely the interior eastern region along the St. Lawrence River. His explorations consolidated France&#x27;s claim of the territory that would later be colonized as New France, and his third voyage produced the first documented European attempt at settling North America since that of Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón in 1526–27.

Cartier&#x27;s professional abilities can be easily ascertained. Considering that Cartier made three voyages of exploration in dangerous and hitherto unknown waters without losing a ship, and that he entered and departed some 50 undiscovered harbours without serious mishap, he may be considered one of the most conscientious explorers of the period.

Cartier was also one of the first to formally acknowledge that the New World was a land mass separate from Europe/Asia.

==Rediscovery of Cartier&#x27;s first colony==

On August 18, 2006, Quebec Premier Jean Charest announced that Canadian archaeologists had discovered the precise location of Cartier&#x27;s lost first colony of Charlesbourg-Royal. The colony was built at the confluence of the Rivière du Cap Rouge with the St. Lawrence River and is based on the discovery of burnt wooden timber remains that have been dated to the mid-16th century, and a fragment of a decorative Istoriato plate manufactured in Faenza, Italy, between 1540 and 1550, that could only have belonged to a member of the French aristocracy in the colony. Most probably this was the Sieur de Roberval, who replaced Cartier as the leader of the settlement. This colony was the first known European settlement in modern-day Canada since the c. 1000 L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows Viking village in northern Newfoundland. Its rediscovery has been hailed by archaeologists as the most important find in Canada since the L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows rediscovery.

The Banque Jacques-Cartier existed, and printed banknotes, between 1861 and 1899 in Lower Canada, then Quebec. It was folded into the Banque provinciale du Canada, and later still the National Bank of Canada.

In 2005, Cartier&#x27;s &quot;Bref récit et succincte narration de la navigation faite en MDXXXV et MDXXXVI&quot; was named one of the 100 most important books in Canadian history by the &quot;Literary Review of Canada&quot;.

Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip reference Jacques Cartier in their 1992 song &quot;Looking for a Place to Happen&quot;. The song deals with the subject of European encroachment in the New World and the eventual annexation of indigenous lands in North America.

<text>Hermeneutics () is the theory and methodology of interpretation, especially the interpretation of biblical texts, wisdom literature, and philosophical texts. As necessary, hermeneutics may include the art of understanding and communication.

Modern hermeneutics includes both verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as semiotics, presuppositions, and pre-understandings. Hermeneutics has been broadly applied in the humanities, especially in law, history and theology.

Hermeneutics was initially applied to the interpretation, or exegesis, of scripture, and has been later broadened to questions of general interpretation. The terms &quot;hermeneutics&quot; and &quot;exegesis&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably. Hermeneutics is a wider discipline which includes written, verbal, and nonverbal communication. Exegesis focuses primarily upon the word and grammar of texts.

Hermeneutic, as a count noun in the singular, refers to some particular method of interpretation (see, in contrast, double hermeneutic).

== Etymology ==
&quot;Hermeneutics&quot; is derived from the Greek word (&quot;hermēneuō&quot;, &quot;translate, interpret&quot;), from (&quot;hermeneus&quot;, &quot;translator, interpreter&quot;), of uncertain etymology (R. S. P. Beekes (2009) suggests a Pre-Greek origin). The technical term (&quot;hermeneia&quot;, &quot;interpretation, explanation&quot;) was introduced into philosophy mainly through the title of Aristotle&#x27;s work (&quot;Peri Hermeneias&quot;), commonly referred to by its Latin title &quot;De Interpretatione&quot; and translated in English as &quot;On Interpretation&quot;. It is one of the earliest (c. 360 ) extant philosophical works in the Western tradition to deal with the relationship between language and logic in a comprehensive, explicit and formal way.

The early usage of &quot;hermeneutics&quot; places it within the boundaries of the sacred. A divine message must be received with implicit uncertainty regarding its truth. This ambiguity is an irrationality; it is a sort of madness that is inflicted upon the receiver of the message. Only one who possesses a rational method of interpretation (i.e., a hermeneutic) could determine the truth or falsity of the message.

=== Folk etymology ===

Folk etymology places its origin with Hermes, the mythological Greek deity who was the &#x27;messenger of the gods&#x27;. Aside from being a mediator among the gods and between the gods and men, he led souls to the underworld upon death.

Moreover, Hermes was considered the inventor of language and speech, an interpreter, a liar, a thief, and a trickster. These multiple roles made Hermes an ideal representative figure for hermeneutics. As Socrates noted, words have the power to reveal or conceal and can deliver messages in an ambiguous way. The Greek view of language as consisting of signs that could lead to truth or to falsehood was the essence of Hermes, who was said to relish the uneasiness of those who received the messages he delivered.

== In religious traditions ==
=== Mesopotamian hermeneutics ===
=== Islamic hermeneutics ===
=== Talmudic hermeneutics ===


Summaries of the principles by which Torah can be interpreted date back to, at least, Hillel the Elder, although the thirteen principles set forth in the Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael are perhaps the best known. These principles ranged from standard rules of logic (e.g., &quot;a fortiori&quot; argument [known in Hebrew as קל וחומר – &quot;kal v&#x27;chomer&quot;]) to more expansive ones, such as the rule that a passage could be interpreted by reference to another passage in which the same word appears (Gezerah Shavah). The rabbis did not ascribe equal persuasive power to the various principles.

Traditional Jewish hermeneutics differed from the Greek method in that the rabbis considered the Tanakh (the Jewish Biblical canon) to be without error. Any apparent inconsistencies had to be understood by means of careful examination of a given text within the context of other texts. There were different levels of interpretation: some were used to arrive at the plain meaning of the text, some expounded the law given in the text, and others found secret or mystical levels of understanding.

=== Vedic hermeneutics ===
Vedic hermeneutics involves the exegesis of the Vedas, the earliest holy texts of Hinduism. The Mimamsa was the leading hermeneutic school and their primary purpose was understanding what Dharma (righteous living) involved by a detailed hermeneutic study of the Vedas. They also derived the rules for the various rituals that had to be performed precisely.

The foundational text is the Mimamsa Sutra of Jaimini (ca. 3rd to 1st century BCE) with a major commentary by Śabara (ca. the 5th or 6th century CE). The Mimamsa sutra summed up the basic rules for Vedic interpretation.

=== Buddhist hermeneutics ===
Buddhist hermeneutics deals with the interpretation of the vast Buddhist literature, particularly those texts which are said to be spoken by the Buddha (Buddhavacana) and other enlightened beings. Buddhist hermeneutics is deeply tied to Buddhist spiritual practice and its ultimate aim is to extract skillful means of reaching spiritual enlightenment or nirvana. A central question in Buddhist hermeneutics is which Buddhist teachings are explicit, representing ultimate truth, and which teachings are merely conventional or relative.

=== Biblical hermeneutics ===

Biblical hermeneutics is the study of the principles of interpretation of the Bible. While Jewish and Christian biblical hermeneutics have some overlap, they have very different interpretive traditions.

The early patristic traditions of biblical exegesis had few unifying characteristics in the beginning but tended toward unification in later schools of biblical hermeneutics.

Augustine offers hermeneutics and homiletics in his &quot;De doctrina christiana&quot;. He stresses the importance of humility in the study of Scripture. He also regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as the heart of Christian faith. In Augustine&#x27;s hermeneutics, signs have an important role. God can communicate with the believer through the signs of the Scriptures. Thus, humility, love, and the knowledge of signs are an essential hermeneutical presupposition for a sound interpretation of the Scriptures. Although Augustine endorses some teaching of the Platonism of his time, he recasts it according to a theocentric doctrine of the Bible. Similarly, in a practical discipline, he modifies the classical theory of oratory in a Christian way. He underscores the meaning of diligent study of the Bible and prayer as more than mere human knowledge and oratory skills. As a concluding remark, Augustine encourages the interpreter and preacher of the Bible to seek a good manner of life and, most of all, to love God and neighbor.

There is traditionally a fourfold sense of biblical hermeneutics: literal, moral, allegorical (spiritual), and anagogical.

==== Literal ====

Encyclopædia Britannica states that literal analysis means &quot;a biblical text is to be deciphered according to the &#x27;plain meaning&#x27; expressed by its linguistic construction and historical context.&quot; The intention of the authors is believed to correspond to the literal meaning. Literal hermeneutics is often associated with the verbal inspiration of the Bible.

==== Moral ====
Moral interpretation searches for moral lessons which can be understood from writings within the Bible. Allegories are often placed in this category.

==== Allegorical ====
Allegorical interpretation states that biblical narratives have a second level of reference that is more than the people, events and things that are explicitly mentioned. One type of allegorical interpretation is known as typological, where the key figures, events, and establishments of the Old Testament are viewed as &quot;types&quot; (patterns). In the New Testament this can also include foreshadowing of people, objects, and events. According to this theory, readings like Noah&#x27;s Ark could be understood by using the Ark as a &quot;type&quot; of the Christian church that God designed from the start.

==== Anagogical ====
This type of interpretation is more often known as mystical interpretation. It claims to explain the events of the Bible and how they relate to or predict what the future holds. This is evident in the Jewish Kabbalah, which attempts to reveal the mystical significance of the numerical values of Hebrew words and letters.

In Judaism, anagogical interpretation is also evident in the medieval Zohar. In Christianity, it can be seen in Mariology.

== Philosophical hermeneutics ==
=== Ancient and medieval hermeneutics ===
=== Modern hermeneutics ===
The discipline of hermeneutics emerged with the new humanist education of the 15th century as a historical and critical methodology for analyzing texts. In a triumph of early modern hermeneutics, the Italian humanist Lorenzo Valla proved in 1440 that the &quot;Donation of Constantine&quot; was a forgery. This was done through intrinsic evidence of the text itself. Thus hermeneutics expanded from its medieval role of explaining the true meaning of the Bible.

However, biblical hermeneutics did not die off. For example, the Protestant Reformation brought about a renewed interest in the interpretation of the Bible, which took a step away from the interpretive tradition developed during the Middle Ages back to the texts themselves. Martin Luther and John Calvin emphasized &quot;scriptura sui ipsius interpres&quot; (scripture interprets itself). Calvin used &quot;brevitas et facilitas&quot; as an aspect of theological hermeneutics.

The rationalist Enlightenment led hermeneutists, especially Protestant exegetists, to view Scriptural texts as secular classical texts. They interpreted Scripture as responses to historical or social forces so that, for example, apparent contradictions and difficult passages in the New Testament might be clarified by comparing their possible meanings with contemporary Christian practices.

Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834) explored the nature of understanding in relation not just to the problem of deciphering sacred texts but to all human texts and modes of communication.

The interpretation of a text must proceed by framing its content in terms of the overall organization of the work. Schleiermacher distinguished between grammatical interpretation and psychological interpretation. The former studies how a work is composed from general ideas; the latter studies the peculiar combinations that characterize the work as a whole. He said that every problem of interpretation is a problem of understanding and even defined hermeneutics as the art of avoiding misunderstanding. Misunderstanding was to be avoided by means of knowledge of grammatical and psychological laws.

During Schleiermacher&#x27;s time, a fundamental shift occurred from understanding not merely the exact words and their objective meaning, to an understanding of the writer&#x27;s distinctive character and point of view.

Nineteenth- and twentieth-century hermeneutics emerged as a theory of understanding (&quot;Verstehen&quot;) through the work of Friedrich Schleiermacher (Romantic hermeneutics and methodological hermeneutics), August Böckh (methodological hermeneutics), Wilhelm Dilthey (epistemological hermeneutics), Martin Heidegger (ontological hermeneutics, hermeneutic phenomenology, and transcendental hermeneutic phenomenology), Hans-Georg Gadamer (ontological hermeneutics), Leo Strauss (Straussian hermeneutics), Paul Ricœur (hermeneutic phenomenology), Walter Benjamin (Marxist hermeneutics), Ernst Bloch (Marxist hermeneutics), Jacques Derrida (radical hermeneutics, namely deconstruction), Richard Kearney (diacritical hermeneutics), Fredric Jameson (Marxist hermeneutics), and John Thompson (critical hermeneutics).

Regarding the relation of hermeneutics with problems of analytic philosophy, there has been, particularly among analytic Heideggerians and those working on Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy of science, an attempt to try and situate Heidegger&#x27;s hermeneutic project in debates concerning realism and anti-realism: arguments have been presented both for Heidegger&#x27;s hermeneutic idealism (the thesis that meaning determines reference or, equivalently, that our understanding of the being of entities is what determines entities as entities) and for Heidegger&#x27;s hermeneutic realism (the thesis that (a) there is a nature in itself and science can give us an explanation of how that nature works, and (b) that (a) is compatible with the ontological implications of our everyday practices).

Philosophers that worked to combine analytic philosophy with hermeneutics include Georg Henrik von Wright and Peter Winch. Roy J. Howard termed this approach analytic hermeneutics.

Other contemporary philosophers influenced by the hermeneutic tradition include Charles Taylor (engaged hermeneutics) and Dagfinn Føllesdal.

==== Dilthey (1833–1911) ====
Wilhelm Dilthey broadened hermeneutics even more by relating interpretation to historical objectification. Understanding moves from the outer manifestations of human action and productivity to the exploration of their inner meaning. In his last important essay, &quot;The Understanding of Other Persons and Their Manifestations of Life&quot; (1910), Dilthey made clear that this move from outer to inner, from expression to what is expressed, is not based on empathy, understood as a direct identification with the Other. Interpretation, on a hermeneutical conception of empathy involves an indirect or mediated understanding that can only be attained by placing human expressions in their historical context. Thus, understanding is not a process of reconstructing the state of mind of the author, but one of articulating what is expressed in his work.

Dilthey divided sciences of the mind (human sciences) into three structural levels: experience, expression, and comprehension.

* Experience means to feel a situation or thing personally. Dilthey suggested that we can always grasp the meaning of unknown thought when we try to experience it. His understanding of experience is very similar to that of phenomenologist Edmund Husserl.
* Expression converts experience into meaning because the discourse has an appeal to someone outside of oneself. Every saying is an expression. Dilthey suggested that one can always return to an expression, especially to its written form, and this practice has the same objective value as an experiment in science. The possibility of returning makes scientific analysis possible, and therefore the humanities may be labeled as science. Moreover, he assumed that an expression may be &quot;saying&quot; more than the speaker intends because the expression brings forward meanings which the individual consciousness may not fully understand.
* The last structural level of the science of the mind, according to Dilthey, is comprehension, which is a level that contains both comprehension and incomprehension. Incomprehension means, more or less, &quot;wrong understanding&quot;. He assumed that comprehension produces coexistence: &quot;he who understands, understands others; he who does not understand stays alone.&quot;

==== Heidegger (1889–1976) ====
In the 20th century, Martin Heidegger&#x27;s philosophical hermeneutics shifted the focus from interpretation to existential understanding as rooted in fundamental ontology, which was treated more as a direct—and thus more authentic—way of being-in-the-world (&quot;In-der-Welt-sein&quot;) than merely as &quot;a way of knowing.&quot; For example, he called for a &quot;special hermeneutic of empathy&quot; to dissolve the classic philosophic issue of &quot;other minds&quot; by putting the issue in the context of the being-with of human relatedness. (Heidegger himself did not complete this inquiry.)

Advocates of this approach claim that some texts, and the people who produce them, cannot be studied by means of using the same scientific methods that are used in the natural sciences, thus drawing upon arguments similar to those of antipositivism. Moreover, they claim that such texts are conventionalized expressions of the experience of the author. Thus, the interpretation of such texts will reveal something about the social context in which they were formed, and, more significantly, will provide the reader with a means of sharing the experiences of the author.

The reciprocity between text and context is part of what Heidegger called the hermeneutic circle. Among the key thinkers who elaborated this idea was the sociologist Max Weber.

==== Gadamer (1900–2002) ====
Hans-Georg Gadamer&#x27;s hermeneutics is a development of the hermeneutics of his teacher, Heidegger. Gadamer asserted that methodical contemplation is opposite to experience and reflection. We can reach the truth only by understanding or mastering our experience. According to Gadamer, our understanding is not fixed but rather is changing and always indicating new perspectives. The most important thing is to unfold the nature of individual understanding.

Gadamer pointed out that prejudice is an element of our understanding and is not &quot;per se&quot; without value. Indeed, prejudices, in the sense of pre-judgements of the thing we want to understand, are unavoidable. Being alien to a particular tradition is a condition of our understanding. He said that we can never step outside of our tradition—all we can do is try to understand it. This further elaborates the idea of the hermeneutic circle.

==== New hermeneutic ====
New hermeneutic is the theory and methodology of interpretation to understand Biblical texts through existentialism. The essence of new hermeneutic emphasizes not only the existence of language but also the fact that language is eventualized in the history of individual life. This is called the event of language. Ernst Fuchs, Gerhard Ebeling, and James M. Robinson are the scholars who represent the new hermeneutics.

==== Marxist hermeneutics ====
The method of Marxist hermeneutics has been developed by the work of, primarily, Walter Benjamin and Fredric Jameson. Benjamin outlines his theory of the allegory in his study &quot;Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels&quot; (&quot;Trauerspiel&quot; literally means &quot;mourning play&quot; but is often translated as &quot;tragic drama&quot;). Fredric Jameson draws on Biblical hermeneutics, Ernst Bloch, and the work of Northrop Frye, to advance his theory of Marxist hermeneutics in his influential &quot;The Political Unconscious&quot;. Jameson&#x27;s Marxist hermeneutics is outlined in the first chapter of the book, titled &quot;On Interpretation&quot; Jameson re-interprets (and secularizes) the fourfold system (or four levels) of Biblical exegesis (literal; moral; allegorical; anagogical) to relate interpretation to the mode of production, and eventually, history.

==== Objective hermeneutics ====
Karl Popper first used the term &quot;objective hermeneutics&quot; in his &quot;Objective Knowledge&quot; (1972).

In 1992, the Association for Objective Hermeneutics (AGOH) was founded in Frankfurt am Main by scholars of various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Its goal is to provide all scholars who use the methodology of objective hermeneutics with a means of exchanging information.

In one of the few translated texts of this German school of hermeneutics, its founders declared:

==== Other recent developments ====
Bernard Lonergan&#x27;s (1904–1984) hermeneutics is less well known, but a case for considering his work as the culmination of the postmodern hermeneutical revolution that began with Heidegger was made in several articles by Lonergan specialist Frederick G. Lawrence.

Paul Ricœur (1913–2005) developed a hermeneutics that is based upon Heidegger&#x27;s concepts. His work differs in many ways from that of Gadamer.

Karl-Otto Apel (1922–2017) elaborated a hermeneutics based on American semiotics. He applied his model to discourse ethics with political motivations akin to those of critical theory.

Jürgen Habermas (b. 1929) criticized the conservatism of previous hermeneutists, especially Gadamer, because their focus on tradition seemed to undermine possibilities for social criticism and transformation. He also criticized Marxism and previous members of the Frankfurt School for missing the hermeneutical dimension of critical theory.

Habermas incorporated the notion of the lifeworld and emphasized the importance for social theory of interaction, communication, labor, and production. He viewed hermeneutics as a dimension of critical social theory.

Rudolf Makkreel (b. 1939) has proposed an orientational hermeneutics that brings out the contextualizing function of reflective judgment. It extends ideas of Kant and Dilthey to supplement the dialogical approach of Gadamer with a diagnostic approach that can deal with an ever-changing and multicultural world.

Andrés Ortiz-Osés (1943–2021) developed his symbolic hermeneutics as the Mediterranean response to Northern European hermeneutics. His main statement regarding symbolic understanding of the world is that meaning is a symbolic healing of injury.

Two other important hermeneutic scholars are Jean Grondin (b. 1955) and Maurizio Ferraris (b. 1956).

Mauricio Beuchot coined the term and discipline of analogic hermeneutics, which is a type of hermeneutics that is based upon interpretation and takes into account the plurality of aspects of meaning. He drew categories both from analytic and continental philosophy, as well as from the history of thought.

Two scholars who have published criticism of Gadamer&#x27;s hermeneutics are the Italian jurist Emilio Betti and the American literary theorist E. D. Hirsch.

== Applications ==
=== Archaeology ===
In archaeology, hermeneutics means the interpretation and understanding of material through analysis of possible meanings and social uses.

Proponents argue that interpretation of artifacts is unavoidably hermeneutic because we cannot know for certain the meaning behind them. We can only apply modern values when interpreting. This is most commonly seen in stone tools, where descriptions such as &quot;scraper&quot; can be highly subjective and actually unproven until the development of microwear analysis some thirty years ago.

Opponents argue that a hermeneutic approach is too relativist and that their own interpretations are based on common-sense evaluation.

=== Architecture ===
There are several traditions of architectural scholarship that draw upon the hermeneutics of Heidegger and Gadamer, such as Christian Norberg-Schulz, and Nader El-Bizri in the circles of phenomenology. Lindsay Jones examines the way architecture is received and how that reception changes with time and context (e.g., how a building is interpreted by critics, users, and historians). Dalibor Vesely situates hermeneutics within a critique of the application of overly scientific thinking to architecture. This tradition fits within a critique of the Enlightenment and has also informed design-studio teaching. Adrian Snodgrass sees the study of history and Asian cultures by architects as a hermeneutical encounter with otherness. He also deploys arguments from hermeneutics to explain design as a process of interpretation. Along with Richard Coyne, he extends the argument to the nature of architectural education and design.

=== Education ===

Hermeneutics motivates a broad range of applications in educational theory. The connection between hermeneutics and education has deep historical roots. The ancient Greeks gave the interpretation of poetry a central place in educational practice, as indicated by Dilthey: &quot;systematic exegesis (&quot;hermeneia&quot;) of the poets developed out of the demands of the educational system.&quot; 

Gadamer more recently wrote on the topic of education, and more recent treatments of educational issues across various hermeneutical approaches are to be found in Fairfield and Gallagher.

=== Environment ===
Environmental hermeneutics applies hermeneutics to environmental issues conceived broadly to subjects including &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;wilderness&quot; (both terms are matters of hermeneutical contention), landscapes, ecosystems, built environments (where it overlaps architectural hermeneutics ), inter-species relationships, the relationship of the body to the world, and more.

=== International relations ===
Insofar as hermeneutics is a basis of both critical theory and constitutive theory (both of which have made important inroads into the postpositivist branch of international relations theory and political science), it has been applied to international relations.

Steve Smith refers to hermeneutics as the principal way of grounding foundationalist yet postpositivist theory of international relations.

Radical postmodernism is an example of a postpositivist anti-foundationalist paradigm of international relations.

=== Law ===

Some scholars argue that law and theology are particular forms of hermeneutics because of their need to interpret legal tradition or scriptural texts. Moreover, the problem of interpretation has been central to legal theory since at least the 11th century.

In the Middle Ages and Italian Renaissance, the schools of &quot;glossatores&quot;, &quot;commentatores&quot;, and &quot;usus modernus&quot; distinguished themselves by their approach to the interpretation of &quot;laws&quot; (mainly Justinian&#x27;s Corpus Juris Civilis). The University of Bologna gave birth to a &quot;legal Renaissance&quot; in the 11th century, when the Corpus Juris Civilis was rediscovered and systematically studied by men such as Irnerius and Johannes Gratian. It was an interpretative Renaissance. Subsequently, these were fully developed by Thomas Aquinas and Alberico Gentili.

Since then, interpretation has always been at the center of legal thought. Friedrich Carl von Savigny and Emilio Betti, among others, made significant contributions to general hermeneutics. Legal interpretivism, most famously Ronald Dworkin&#x27;s, may be seen as a branch of philosophical hermeneutics.

=== Phenomenology ===

In qualitative research, the beginnings of phenomenology stem from German philosopher and researcher Edmund Husserl. In his early days, Husserl studied mathematics, but over time his disinterest with empirical methods led him to philosophy and eventually phenomenology. Husserl&#x27;s phenomenology inquires on the specifics of a certain experience or experiences and attempts to unfold the meaning of experience in everyday life. Phenomenology started as philosophy and then developed into methodology over time. American researcher Don Ihde contributed to phenomenological research methodology through what he described as experimental phenomenology: &quot;Phenomenology, in the first instance, is like an investigative science, an essential component of which is an experiment.&quot; His work contributed heavily to the implementation of phenomenology as a methodology.

The beginnings of hermeneutic phenomenology stem from a German researcher and student of Husserl, Martin Heidegger. Both researchers attempted to pull out the lived experiences of others through philosophical concepts, but Heidegger&#x27;s main difference from Husserl was his belief that consciousness was not separate from the world but a formation of who we are as living individuals. Hermeneutic phenomenology stresses that every event or encounter involves some type of interpretation from an individual&#x27;s background, and that we cannot separate this from an individual&#x27;s development through life. Ihde also focuses on hermeneutic phenomenology within his early work, and draws connections between Husserl and French philosopher Paul Ricoeur&#x27;s work in the field. Ricoeur focuses on the importance of symbols and linguistics within hermeneutic phenomenology. Overall, hermeneutic phenomenological research focuses on historical meanings and experiences, and their developmental and social effects on individuals.

=== Political philosophy ===
Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo and Spanish philosopher Santiago Zabala in their book &quot;Hermeneutic Communism&quot;, when discussing contemporary capitalist regimes, stated that, &quot;A politics of descriptions does not impose power in order to dominate as a philosophy; rather, it is functional for the continued existence of a society of dominion, which pursues truth in the form of imposition (violence), conservation (realism), and triumph (history).&quot;

Vattimo and Zabala also stated that they view interpretation as anarchy and affirmed that &quot;existence is interpretation&quot; and that &quot;hermeneutics is weak thought.&quot;

=== Psychoanalysis ===

Psychoanalysts have made ample use of hermeneutics since Sigmund Freud first gave birth to their discipline. In 1900 Freud wrote that the title he chose for &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; &#x27;makes plain which of the traditional approaches to the problem of dreams I am inclined to follow...[&quot;i.e.&quot;] &quot;interpreting&quot; a dream implies assigning a &quot;meaning&quot; to it.&#x27;

The French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan later extended Freudian hermeneutics into other psychical realms. His early work from the 1930s–50s is particularly influenced by Heidegger, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s hermeneutical phenomenology.

=== Psychology and cognitive science ===
Psychologists and Cognitive science have recently become interested in hermeneutics, especially as an alternative to cognitivism.

Hubert Dreyfus&#x27;s critique of conventional artificial intelligence has been influential among psychologists who are interested in hermeneutic approaches to meaning and interpretation, as discussed by philosophers such as Martin Heidegger (cf. Embodied cognition) and Ludwig Wittgenstein (cf. Discursive psychology).

Hermeneutics is also influential in humanistic psychology.

=== Religion and theology ===

The understanding of a theological text depends upon the reader&#x27;s particular hermeneutical viewpoint. Some theorists, such as Paul Ricœur, have applied modern philosophical hermeneutics to theological texts (in Ricœur&#x27;s case, the Bible).

Mircea Eliade, as a hermeneutist, understands religion as &#x27;experience of the sacred&#x27;, and interprets the sacred in relation to the profane. The Romanian scholar underlines that the relation between the sacred and the profane is not of opposition, but of complementarity, having interpreted the profane as a hierophany. The hermeneutics of the myth is a part of the hermeneutics of religion. Myth should not be interpreted as an illusion or a lie, because there is truth in myth to be rediscovered. Myth is interpreted by Mircea Eliade as &#x27;sacred history&#x27;. He introduces the concept of &#x27;total hermeneutics&#x27;.

=== Safety science ===
In the field of safety science, and especially in the study of human reliability, scientists have become increasingly interested in hermeneutic approaches.

It has been proposed by ergonomist Donald Taylor that mechanist models of human behaviour will only take us so far in terms of accident reduction, and that safety science must look at the meaning of accidents for human beings.

Other scholars in the field have attempted to create safety taxonomies that make use of hermeneutic concepts in terms of their categorisation of qualitative data.

=== Sociology ===
In sociology, hermeneutics is the interpretation and understanding of social events through analysis of their meanings for the human participants in the events. It enjoyed prominence during the 1960s and 1970s, and differs from other interpretive schools of sociology in that it emphasizes both context and form within any given social behaviour.

The central principle of sociological hermeneutics is that it is only possible to know the meaning of an act or statement within the context of the discourse or world view from which it originates. Context is critical to comprehension; an action or event that carries substantial weight to one person or culture may be viewed as meaningless or entirely different to another. For example, giving the &quot;thumbs-up&quot; gesture is widely accepted as a sign of a job well done in the United States, while other cultures view it as an insult. Similarly, marking a piece of paper and putting it into a box might be considered a meaningless act unless it is put into the context of an election (the act of putting a ballot paper into a box).

Friedrich Schleiermacher, widely regarded as the father of sociological hermeneutics believed that, in order for an interpreter to understand the work of another author, they must familiarize themselves with the historical context in which the author published their thoughts. His work led to the inspiration of Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;hermeneutic circle&quot; a frequently referenced model that claims one&#x27;s understanding of individual parts of a text is based on their understanding of the whole text, while the understanding of the whole text is dependent on the understanding of each individual part. Hermeneutics in sociology was also heavily influenced by German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer.

== Criticism ==
Jürgen Habermas criticizes Gadamer&#x27;s hermeneutics as being unsuitable for understanding society because it is unable to account for questions of social reality, like labor and domination.

<text>Helen Herring Stephens (February 3, 1918 – January 17, 1994) was an American athlete and a double Olympic champion in 1936.

==Biography==
Stephens, nicknamed the &quot;Fulton Flash&quot; after her birthplace, Fulton, Missouri, was a strong athlete in sprint events—she never lost a race in her entire career—and also in weight events such as the shot put and discus throw. She won national titles in both categories.

When she was 18, Stephens participated in the 1936 Summer Olympics. There she won the 100 m final, beating reigning champion and world record holder, Stanisława Walasiewicz (aka Stella Walsh) of Poland. Stephen&#x27;s time of 11.5 s was below the world record, but was not recognized because a strong tailwind was blowing at the time of the race. Next, Stephens anchored the American 4 × 100 m relay team that won the Olympic title after the leading German team dropped its baton.

Stephens is quoted by Olympic historian, David Wallechinsky, about her post-race experience with Adolf Hitler. &quot;He comes in and gives me the Nazi salute. I gave him a good, old-fashioned Missouri handshake,&quot; she said. &quot;Once more Hitler goes for the jugular vein. He gets hold of my fanny and begins to squeeze and pinch, and hug me up. And he said: &#x27;You&#x27;re a true Aryan type. You should be running for Germany.&#x27; So after he gave me the once over and a full massage, he asked me if I&#x27;d like to spend the weekend in Berchtesgaden.&quot; Stephens refused.

Stephens retired from athletics shortly after the games and played professional baseball and softball. She attended William Woods University, Fulton High School, and Middle River School in Fulton. She was later inducted into the William Woods Owls Hall of Fame, described as &quot;the most well-known athlete in Fulton’s history.&quot; From 1938 to 1952, she was the owner and manager of her own semi-professional basketball team; she was the first woman to own and manage a semi-professional basketball team. She was employed for many years in the Research Division of the U.S. Aeronautical Chart and Information Service (later, a part of the Defense Mapping Agency) in St. Louis, Missouri.

Her longtime partner was Mabel O. Robbe (née Wires), a dietician at Francis Shimer College.

In 1993, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

She died in Saint Louis at age 75.

At the 1936 Olympics, it was suggested that both Stephens and Stanisława Walasiewicz were, in fact, male. Stephens received scrutiny over her gender after 100 m victory, with the Warsaw-based newspaper Kurier Poranny writing, &quot;It is scandalous that the Americans entered a man in the women&#x27;s competition.&quot; Other newspapers soon also reported on Stephens alleged lack of femininity. Stephens later told her biographer that she told reporters who questioned her about her gender &quot;to check the facts with the Olympic committee physician who sex-tested all athletes prior to competition.&quot;

Newspapers soon reported that German officials had given Stephens a so-called sex test and let her compete only after they had confirmed she was a woman. The &quot;Harrisbug Telegraph&quot; reported that International Olympic Committee performed a physical check on Stephens and concluded that she was a woman. These reports were denied by IOC committee member Avery Brundage and no further evidence surfaced. In 1938, Paul Gallico in his book &quot;Farewell to Sport&quot; suggested that American sports officials had examined Stephens prior to the Olympic games. On August 28, following the Olympics but before returning to New York, Stephens wrote in her diary that she was inspected by American officials.

<doc id="70613" wikidata="Q361184" url="?curid=70613" title="James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell">
<text>James Hepburn, 1st Duke of Orkney and 4th Earl of Bothwell ( – 14 April 1578), better known simply as Lord Bothwell, was the third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. He was accused of the murder of Mary&#x27;s second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, a charge of which he was acquitted. His marriage to Mary was controversial and divided the country; when he fled the growing rebellion to Norway, he was arrested and lived the rest of his life imprisoned in Denmark.

==Early life==
James Hepburn was the son of Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell, and Agnes Sinclair (d. 1572), daughter of Henry, Lord Sinclair, and was styled &quot;The Master of Bothwell&quot; from birth. He succeeded his father as Earl of Bothwell and Lord Hailes in 1556.

==Marriages==
As Lord High Admiral of Scotland, Lord Bothwell visited Copenhagen around 1559. He fell in love with Anna Tronds, known in English as Anna Throndsen or Anna Rustung. She was a Norwegian noblewoman whose father, Kristoffer Trondson, a famous Norwegian admiral, was serving as Danish Royal Consul. After their engagement, or more likely marriage under Norwegian law, Anna left with Bothwell. In Flanders, he said he was out of money and asked Anna to sell all her possessions. She complied and visited her family in Denmark to ask for more money. Anna was unhappy and apparently given to complaining about Bothwell. His treatment of Anna played a part in his eventual downfall.

In February 1566, Bothwell married Lady Jean Gordon, daughter of the 4th Earl of Huntly and sister of Sir John Gordon and the 5th Earl of Huntly. They were divorced on 7 May 1567, citing his adultery with her servant Bessie Crawford as cause. He married Mary, Queen of Scots, eight days later.

==Meeting Queen Mary in France==
Lord Bothwell appears to have met Queen Mary when he visited the French Court in the autumn of 1560, after he left Anna Rustung in Flanders. He was kindly received by the Queen and her husband, King Francis II of France, and, as he put it: &quot;The Queen recompensed me more liberally and honourably than I had deserved&quot; – receiving 600 Crowns and the post and salary of gentleman of the French King&#x27;s Chamber. He visited France again in the spring of 1561, and by 5 July was back in Paris for the third time – this time accompanied by the Bishop of Orkney and the Earl of Eglinton. By August, the widowed Queen was on her way back to Scotland in a French galley, some of the organisation having been dealt with by Bothwell in his naval capacity.

==Under Mary of Guise&#x27;s regency==
Bothwell supported Mary of Guise, queen dowager and Regent of Scotland, against the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Bothwell and 24 followers took 6000 crowns of English money destined to be used against Guise from the Laird of Ormiston on Halloween 1559 at an ambush near Haddington. In retaliation the Protestant leader, the Duke of Châtelherault, sent his son the Earl of Arran and the Master of Maxwell to seize Bothwell&#x27;s home Crichton Castle and force the Earl, who was nearby at Borthwick, to join them. Bothwell remained true to the Regent, though it was said in January he was &quot;weary of his part&quot;. The English diplomat Thomas Randolph also hinted at this time of a scandal involving his sister Jean Hepburn.

==At Queen Mary&#x27;s court==
After Protestant Lords gained power following Mary of Guise&#x27;s death and the return to Scotland of Mary, Queen of Scots, Bothwell appears to have been not much more than a troublesome noble at court. His open quarrel with the Earl of Arran and the Hamiltons, who accused him of intriguing against the Crown, caused some degree of anguish to the Queen, and although the Earl of Arran was eventually declared mad, Bothwell was nevertheless imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle without trial in 1562. Later that year, while the Queen was in the Highlands, he escaped and went to Hermitage Castle.

The Queen and Bothwell were by now very close. When Bothwell married Lady Jean Gordon, daughter of The 4th Earl of Huntly, in February 1566, the Queen attended the wedding (the marriage lasted just over a year). In the following autumn, upon hearing that he had been seriously wounded and was likely to die, she rode from Jedburgh to be with him at Hermitage Castle. However, historian Antonia Fraser asserts that Queen Mary was already on her way to visit Bothwell on matters of state before she heard about his illness, and that therefore this visit is not evidence they were already lovers at the time of his accident. Author Alison Weir agrees, and in fact the records show that Mary waited a full six days after learning of his injuries before going to visit Bothwell. The story of her mad flight to his side was put about later by her enemies to discredit her.

==Darnley&#x27;s murder==

On 9 February 1567 Bothwell left his lodging at Todrick&#x27;s Wynd on the south side of the Royal Mile in Edinburgh (east of Blackfriars Street) and with accomplices Dalgliesh, Powrie and Wilson, carried several kegs of gunpowder to Kirk o&#x27;Field lodging to the south, almost encountering Queen Mary en route. At Kirk O&#x27;Field they lit the gunpowder destroying part of the building and killing Darnley and his aide.

Bothwell was publicly accused of having murdered the Queen&#x27;s consort, Lord Darnley. Darnley&#x27;s father, the Earl of Lennox, and other relatives agitated for vengeance and the Privy Council began proceedings against Bothwell on 12 April 1567. Sir William Drury reported to Sir William Cecil, Secretary of State to Elizabeth I of England, that the Queen was in continuous ill-health &quot;for the most part either melancholy or sickly&quot;. On the appointed day Bothwell rode magnificently down the Canongate, with the Earl of Morton and William Maitland of Lethington flanking him, and his Hepburns trotting behind. The trial lasted from noon till seven in the evening. Bothwell was acquitted and it was widely rumoured that he would marry Mary.

==Abduction of and marriage to Queen Mary==
The next Wednesday, the Queen rode to the Estates of Parliament, with Lord Bothwell carrying the Sceptre, where the proceedings of Bothwell&#x27;s trial were officially declared to be just according to the law of the land. On Saturday 19 April 1567, eight bishops, nine earls, and seven Lords of Parliament put their signatures to what became known as the Ainslie Tavern Bond, a manifesto declaring that Mary should marry a native-born subject, and handed it to Bothwell.

On 24 April, while Mary was on the road from Linlithgow Palace to Edinburgh, Bothwell suddenly appeared with 800 men. He assured her that danger awaited her in Edinburgh, and told her that he proposed to take her to his castle at Dunbar, out of harm&#x27;s way. She agreed to accompany him and arrived at Dunbar at midnight. There, Mary was taken prisoner by Bothwell and allegedly raped by him to secure marriage to her and the crown (though whether she was his accomplice or his unwilling victim remains a controversial issue). On 12 May the Queen created him Duke of Orkney and Marquess of Fife, and on 15 May they were married in the Great Hall at Holyrood, according to Protestant rites officiated by Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney. Mary gave her new husband a fur lined night-gown. There were few festivities until two weeks after the wedding, when there was a triumph and tilt and Bothwell &quot;ran at the ring&quot;.

The marriage divided the country into two camps, and on 16 June, the Lords opposed to Mary and the Duke of Orkney (as Bothwell had newly become) signed a Bond denouncing them. A showdown between the two opposing sides followed at Carberry Hill on 15 June, from which Orkney (as Lord Bothwell was now known) fled, after one final embrace, never to be seen again by Mary. In December that year, Bothwell&#x27;s titles and estates were forfeited by Act of Parliament.

==Escape to Scandinavia and imprisonment==
After fleeing the confrontation at Carberry Hill, the Duke of Orkney (as Bothwell was now) went to Huntly Castle and Spynie Palace. He took ship from Aberdeen to Shetland, where he was helped by Olave Sinclair. Bothwell was pursued by William Kirkcaldy of Grange and William Murray of Tullibardine, who sailed into Bressay Sound near Lerwick. Four of the Duke of Orkney&#x27;s ships in the Sound set sail north to Unst, where Orkney was negotiating with German captains to hire more ships. Kirkcaldy&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Lion&quot;, chased one of Orkney&#x27;s ships, and both ships were damaged on a submerged rock. The Duke of Orkney sent his treasure ship to Scalloway, and fought a three-hour-long sea battle off the Port of Unst, where the mast of one of Orkney&#x27;s ships was shot away. Subsequently, a storm forced the Duke to sail towards Norway.

Orkney may have hoped to reach Denmark and raise an army with the support of Frederick II of Denmark to put Mary back on the throne. He was caught off the coast of Norway (then in a union with Denmark) at Høyevarde lighthouse in Karmsundet without proper papers, and was escorted to the port of Bergen. This was the native home of Anna Throndsen. Anna raised a complaint against Orkney, which was enforced by her powerful family; her cousin Erik Rosenkrantz, a high-level official in Norway, remanded Orkney to the Bergenhus Fortress, while Anna sued him for abandonment and return of her dowry. Anna may have had a soft spot for Orkney, as he persuaded her to take custody of his ship, as compensation. Orkney would have been released, but King Frederick heard that the Scottish government was seeking Orkney for the murder of Darnley, and decided to take him into custody in Denmark.

The Duke of Orkney was sent to Copenhagen, where the Danish monarch, Frederik II, deliberated on his fate. The Duke was sent across Øresund to the fortress and prison Malmøhus Castle. However, as news from both England and Scotland arrived, Frederik eventually understood that Mary never again would become Queen. Without Mary, the King considered him insignificant.

==Death==
He was imprisoned at Dragsholm Castle, west of Copenhagen, and was held in what were said to be appalling conditions. Meanwhile, the Parliament of Scotland officially stripped him of all his Scottish titles, including the Dukedom of Orkney, in December 1567. He died in April 1578, and was buried in a vault at Fårevejle church near the castle.

A pillar to which he was chained for the last ten years of his life can still be seen, with a circular groove in the floor around the pillar.

In 1858, the body was exhumed and declared to be that of Lord Bothwell. It was in a dried condition and was thereafter referred to as &quot;Bothwell&#x27;s mummy&quot;. His extended family tried to get his body sent back to Scotland, but their request has not been granted. The identity of the body has never been conclusively proven.

A body referred to as &quot;Bothwell&#x27;s mummy&quot; materialised in 1976 in the Edinburgh Wax Museum on the Royal Mile, as the only non-wax exhibit. The guide book claimed it was brought to Scotland in 1858.

<text>David Rizzio ( ; ; – 9 March 1566) or Riccio ( , ) was an Italian courtier, born in Pancalieri close to Turin, a descendant of an ancient and noble family still living in Piedmont, the Riccio Counts di San Paolo e Solbrito, who rose to become the private secretary of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary&#x27;s husband, Lord Darnley, is said to have been jealous of their friendship because of rumours that Rizzio had impregnated Mary, and he joined in a conspiracy of Protestant nobles to murder him, led by Patrick Ruthven, 3rd Lord Ruthven. Mary was having dinner with Rizzio and a few ladies-in-waiting when Darnley joined them, accused his wife of adultery and then had a group murder Rizzio, who was hiding behind Mary. Mary was held at gunpoint and Rizzio was stabbed numerous times. His body took 57 dagger wounds. The murder was the catalyst of the downfall of Darnley, and had serious consequences for Mary&#x27;s subsequent reign.

==Career==
Rizzio (whose name appears in Italian records as Davide Riccio di Pancalieri in Piemonte) went first from Turin to the Court of the Duke of Savoy, then at Nice. However, finding no opportunities for advancement there, he found means in 1561 to get himself admitted into the train of Carlo Ubertino Solaro, Count of Moretta, who was about to lead an embassy to Scotland. The Count in Scotland had no employment for Rizzio, and dismissed him. Rizzio however, had made friends with the Queen&#x27;s musicians, who had come with her from France. James Melville, a friend of Rizzio, said that &quot;Her Majesty had three valets in her chamber, who sung three parts, and wanted a bass to sing the fourth part&quot;.

Rizzio was considered a good musician and excellent singer, which brought him to the attention of the cosmopolitan young queen. Towards the end of 1564, having grown wealthy under her patronage, he became the queen&#x27;s secretary for relations with France, after the previous occupant of the post had retired. Rizzio was ambitious, controlling access to the queen and seeing himself as almost a Secretary of State. Other courtiers felt that as a Catholic and a foreigner he was too close to the queen.

===Relationship with Darnley and with Mary===
Rizzio became an ally of Lord Darnley, and helped with plans for his marriage to Mary. George Buchanan described Rizzio gaining Darnley&#x27;s favour. As their familiarity grew, Rizzio was admitted to Darnley&#x27;s chamber, bed, and secret confidence. David Calderwood later wrote that Rizzio had &quot;insinuated himself in the favours of Lord Darnley so far, that they would lie some times in one bed together&quot;.

George Buchanan wrote about events and plots in June 1565 before the royal wedding. He claims that Mary summoned her brother, the Earl of Moray, to meet her at Perth. There, a quarrel between Moray and Darnley would escalate, Rizzio would strike the first blow, and others would ensure Moray was killed. Thomas Randolph described this plan differently, and his version does not involve Rizzio. Moray however did not come to Perth, but stayed at Lochleven Castle. Rumours followed that Moray and the Earl of Argyll planned to kidnap Mary and Darnley as they passed by Kinross.

After the marriage in July 1565, rumours became rife that Mary was having an adulterous affair with Rizzio. It was said (in 1568) that Mary and Darnley&#x27;s love decayed after they returned from the campaign against Moray&#x27;s rebellion, known as the Chaseabout Raid, when Mary was &quot;using the said David more like a lover than a servant, forsaking her husband&#x27;s bed&quot;. According to the report of a French diplomat, Paul de Foix, Darnley discovered Rizzio in the closet of Mary&#x27;s bedchamber at Holyrood house in the middle of the night dressed only in a fur gown over his shirt. George Buchanan included a similar story in his &quot;History&quot;, that Darnley had a key to a secondary door to Mary&#x27;s bedchamber, but found it locked or barred against him. Thereafter, he resolved to be revenged on Rizzio.

Following Darnley&#x27;s murder, Lord Ruthven, in the account known as &quot;Ruthven&#x27;s Relation&quot;, revealed that Darnley had described the circumstances of his jealousy to Mary. This account also focusses on Rizzio&#x27;s presence in Mary&#x27;s bedchamber:Since yon fellow Davie fell in credit and familiarity with your Majesty, you regarded me not, neither treated me nor entertained me after your wonted fashion; for every day before dinner, you would come to my chamber and pass time with me, and thus long time ye have not done done so; and when I come to your Majesty&#x27;s chamber, you bear me little company, except Davie had been the third &quot;marrow&quot; [companion]: and after supper your Majesty hath a use to sit at cards with the said Davie till one or two of the clock after midnight; and this is the entertainment that I have had of you this long time.

The chronicle account, the &quot;Historie of James the Sext&quot;, tells the story in a different way, asserting that Mary&#x27;s secretary, William Maitland of Lethington, was jealous of Rizzio&#x27;s increasing power. Maitland made Darnley jealous of Rizzio, hoping that the naive king-consort would destroy his rival.

===Wealth, possessions and costume===
His annual salary for the post of valet was 150 Francs or £75 Scots. The sum was paid from the &quot;Thirds of Benefices&quot; as were some other household expenses, and not through the treasurer&#x27;s accounts. In 1565, Rizzio received £80 in four installments paid by George Wishart of Drymme.

Mary gave him gifts of rich fabric from her wardrobe, including black velvet figured with gold, and five pieces of gold cloth figured with scales. It was said that Rizzio took bribes. William Douglas of Lochleven wrote that he offered Rizzio £5,000 to prevent the forfeit of the Earl of Moray, but Rizzio refused saying he would not act for £20,000. Rizzio&#x27;s involvement with pardons for the Chaseabout rebels sparked Darnley&#x27;s envy.

According to a letter of Thomas Randolph, Rizzio took part in a costumed masque in February 1566, celebrating the arrival of Nicolas d&#x27;Angennes, seigneur de Rambouillet, who brought the Order of Saint Michael for Darnley.

After his murder, it was noted that Rizzio had been living in wealthy circumstances. He was said to have £2,000 Sterling in gold coins, good clothing including 18 pairs of velvet hose, and his chamber at Holyroodhouse was well-furnished with a variety of hand-guns described as daggs, pistolets, and arquebuses, and 22 swords. He was said to be wearing a very rich jewel at his neck when he was killed, and was wearing a satin doublet and a furred damask night gown, perhaps the garment mentioned in the earlier French report.

== Murder ==

Jealousy precipitated Rizzio&#x27;s murder in the Queen&#x27;s supper chamber in the Palace of Holyroodhouse at 8 o&#x27;clock on Saturday, 9 March 1566. Mary, Rizzio, Jean Stewart, Countess of Argyll, Robert Beaton of Criech and Arthur Erskine were seated at the supper table. The supper room, which still exists as part of the bedchamber, and was then &quot;a cabinet about XII foot square, in the same a little low reposinge bedde, and a table&quot; according to an account of the murder written by Francis, Earl of Bedford, and Thomas Randolph. The room had been decorated by Mary&#x27;s servant Servais de Condé.

On the night of the murder the royal guards were overpowered and the palace was turned over to the control of the rebels. The Queen was six months pregnant (with James VI) at the time, and some accused Rizzio of having impregnated her. The rebels burst into the supper room, led by Lord Ruthven, and demanded that Rizzio be handed over. The Queen refused. Rizzio then hid behind Mary but was nevertheless seized. Mary would allege that one of the intruders, Patrick Bellenden (brother of the Lord Justice Clerk), pointed his gun at her pregnant belly while Andrew Kerr of Faldonsyde threatened to stab her. Lord Ruthven denied this.

After this violent struggle, Rizzio was dragged through the bed-chamber into the adjacent Audience Chamber and stabbed an alleged 57 times. His body was thrown down the main staircase nearby (now disused) and stripped of his jewels and fine clothes. The location of Rizzio&#x27;s murder is marked with a small plaque in the Audience Chamber, underneath which is a red mark on the floorboards, which reportedly was left when Rizzio was stabbed to death.

Rizzio was first buried in the cemetery of Holyrood Abbey. Buchanan states that shortly afterwards his body was removed by the Queen&#x27;s orders and deposited in the tomb of the kings of Scotland in Holyrood Abbey. This strengthened the previous rumours of her familiarity with him. Rumours circulated about the motive for the murder: that Darnley was jealous, or that powerful lords sought to manipulate Darnley and remove an irritating presence at court.

==Aftermath==

Immediately after the murder Mary was able to speak to Lord Darnley, and may have convinced him they were both in danger and captives in the palace. The guard around her was relaxed and at midnight the next day they escaped and she rode behind Arthur Erskine of Blackgrange, master of her stable, to Seton Palace and then to safety at Dunbar Castle. An English servant of Lord Darnley, Anthony Standen, later claimed to have accompanied the queen with John Stewart of Traquair and his brother William Stewart. Mary returned to Edinburgh with her supporters, and took up lodgings on the Royal Mile rather than return to the palace. On 21 March she had Darnley declared innocent of the murder.

Robert Melville arrived in Edinburgh from London and reported back to Elizabeth and Cecil on the aftermath of the murder. He noted that Morton, Lord Ruthven, Lord Lindsay, William Maitland of Lethington, the Clerk Register James Balfour, the Lord Justice Clerk John Bellenden (whose brother was alleged to have pointed a gun at the queen), and some gentlemen of Lothian, who were all suspected of having knowledge of the plan had fled.

William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley and a French diplomat, Paul de Foix discussed the news. De Foix seems at first to have been misled about the events, thinking that Darnley had killed Rizzio because he found such a lowly servant having an adulterous relationship with Mary, an idea not present in the reports of the murder.

Rizzio&#x27;s brother, Joseph, arrived in Scotland with Michel de Castelnau and was appointed secretary in David&#x27;s place by 25 April 1566. Joseph and an Italian colleague, Joseph Lutyni, had some trouble over coins taken from the queen&#x27;s purse, and in April 1567 he was accused and acquitted with Bothwell of Darnley&#x27;s murder.

==Legacy and memorial==
David Rizzio&#x27;s career was remembered and referred to by Henry IV of France. Mocking the pretension of James VI of Scotland to be the &quot;Scottish Solomon&quot;, he remarked that &quot;he hoped he was not David the fiddler&#x27;s son&quot;, alluding to the possibility that Rizzio, not Darnley, fathered King James.

George Buchanan wrote in 1581 that David was first buried outside the door of Holyrood Abbey, and then Mary arranged for him to be buried in the tomb of her father James V and Madeleine of France within. Buchanan described this circumstance as reflecting badly on the Queen. Fearing that Mary&#x27;s son, James VI, would suppress his book, Buchanan&#x27;s friend James Melville tried to get Buchanan to rewrite the passage while the book was at the printers. Buchanan asked his cousin, Thomas Buchanan, a schoolmaster in Stirling, if he thought the story was true, and the cousin agreed. The story was published.

It is sometimes said that Rizzio was buried at the Canongate Kirk and burying ground. Holyroodhouse is within the old Canongate jurisdiction, and Rizzio&#x27;s death was recorded in the Canongate registers. This pre-dated the building of the Canongate Kirk in 1688, and it is unlikely he could be buried there.

==Representation in fiction==
Rizzio was played by John Carradine in the 1936 RKO picture &quot;Mary of Scotland&quot;; by Ian Holm in the 1971 movie &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot;; by Tadeusz Pasternak in the BBC mini-series &quot;Gunpowder, Treason, and Plot&quot;; by Andrew Shaver in The CW network television show &quot;Reign&quot;; and by Ismael Cruz Córdova in the 2018 film &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot;.

The murder of Rizzio and the subsequent downfall of Darnley form the main subject of the 1830 play &quot;Maria Stuart&quot; by Juliusz Słowacki.

Rizzio&#x27;s life and death are a key plot element in Caleb Carr&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Italian Secretary&quot;, Holmes vocally dismissing the idea that Rizzio was ever anything more than entertainment.

Arthur Conan Doyle used the death of Rizzio as a plot point in his 1908 story, “The Silver Mirror”.

Rizzio&#x27;s murder is also the subject of Scottish author Denise Mina&#x27;s 2021 novella, &quot;Rizzio&quot;.

==The takers in hand==
Thomas Randolph listed these men among the participants in Rizzio&#x27;s murder:
*Earl of Morton
*Patrick Ruthven, 3rd Lord Ruthven
*Patrick Lindsay, 6th Lord Lindsay
*William Maitland of Lethington
*Master of Ruthven
*James Ormiston, laird of Ormiston.
*William Sinclair of Herdmanston, laird of &quot;Haughton&quot;
*John Crichton, laird of Brunstane
*The laird of Whittinghame
*The laird of Lochleven
*The laird of Elphingstone (Johnston)
*Patrick Murray
*Andrew Kerr of Fawdonsyde, son-in-law of John Knox
*William Tweedie of Drumelzier
*Adam Tweedie of Dreva
with the preachers; John Knox and John Craig. On 19 March, the Privy Council sent letters to a number of men, requiring they attend in Edinburgh to answer questions. John Carmichael of Meadowflat, later Captain of Crawford, was given a remission or pardon in 1574 for his &quot;art and part&quot; in the detention of Mary at Holyrood from the 9 to 11 March 1566.

<doc id="70615" wikidata="Q1512347" url="?curid=70615" title="List of premiers of Alberta">
<text>There have been 19 heads of government of the Canadian province of Alberta since it was created in 1905. Three were Liberal, three belonged to the United Farmers of Alberta, three were Social Credit, seven were Progressive Conservatives, two have belonged to the United Conservatives and one was New Democratic. The current premier of Alberta is Danielle Smith of the United Conservative Party.

Alberta uses a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the Legislative Assembly. The premier is Alberta&#x27;s head of government, while the King of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the lieutenant governor of Alberta. The premier picks a cabinet, usually from the elected members of the Legislative Assembly, to form the Executive Council of Alberta, and presides over that body.

Members are elected to the legislature during general elections or by-elections. Barring special legislation occasioned by a war or an emergency (which has never happened in Alberta&#x27;s history, although it has federally), general elections must be called by the lieutenant governor, at the premier&#x27;s advice, no later than five years after the previous election, but the premier may ask (and almost always has asked) for dissolution of the legislative assembly and a subsequent election earlier than that. Under Alberta&#x27;s fixed-election legislation of 2024, a general election is to be held on the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year following the most recent general election, but the premier can bindingly advise the lieutenant governor to call an election earlier than the fixed date.

An election may also happen if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature, by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion, but in Alberta&#x27;s history of massive majorities in the assembly, this has never happened. William Aberhart&#x27;s first mandate as premier was almost cut short, when a large part of his caucus showed willingness to vote against his government&#x27;s budget; but when he promised to bring in radical banking reform they were satisfied.

A leader of a party is chosen by the party, following an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. Leaders, not already possessing a seat, must then win a seat in a by-election or general election to sit in the Assembly. Leaders of a party without a seat must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.

Prior to 1905, Alberta was part of the North-West Territories and as part of this jurisdiction was governed by the North-West Legislative Council, composed of elected and appointed officials, led by lieutenant governors of the North-West Territories until 1897, and by lieutenant governors of the Northwest Territories and the premier of the North-West Territories from 1897 to 1905.

Since 1905 Alberta&#x27;s premiers have belonged to six different political parties. However, there have been only five changes of government, as governments once elected are usually in for long periods and have always been majority governments. No defeated party has yet returned to power. , three women have served as Premier of Alberta, more than any other province.

== History ==

=== Liberal Party 1905–1921 ===
The Liberal party got its start in power in Alberta when Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier appointed Alexander Rutherford, a prominent liberal and former elected NWT Assembly member, as interim premier in 1905. He and other Liberals organized the province&#x27;s first election.

Rutherford&#x27;s Liberal party was elected, with a majority of the popular vote and a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly in the province&#x27;s first election, the 1905 Alberta election. The north-central constituency boundaries radiated out from Edmonton and some say this was a case of gerrymandered electoral boundaries. Rutherford&#x27;s government received a majority of votes in the election and emerged from the March 1909 election leading another formidable majority, which clearly reflected the broad popular support he and his government enjoyed. He would resign as premier 14 months later, in May 1910, after his government was implicated in the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal.

Arthur Sifton replaced Rutherford as premier. Shortly before the 1913 election Sifton&#x27;s Liberals jammed through a controversial bill greatly expanding the size of the legislative assembly. The bill was once again said to gerrymander boundaries in Liberals&#x27; favor, although the Liberals again received more votes than any other party in the 1913 election. The press and opposition would term his reign as premier &quot;Siftonism&quot; implying that his reign was a disease on Alberta. Sifton only lasted one mandate as premier as he left to pursue a career in federal politics.

Charles Stewart replaced Sifton and held the Liberal government through the lackluster 1917 election which 11 MLAs serving in the armed forces were automatically re-elected. The elected opposition was the strongest so far in the province&#x27;s 12-year history. The Conservatives, which formed the official opposition with 19 seats, slightly more than one-third of the seats in the Assembly, expressed hopes they had the upper hand on the waning Liberal government.
Both would be surprised by the United Farmers who routed the Liberals and Conservatives in rural areas to form the government in the 1921 election.

=== United Farmers 1921–1935 ===
Alberta&#x27;s second dynasty was the United Farmers of Alberta, a farmers&#x27; movement organization, formed in 1909 as a lobby group, whose political wing rose from a minor party named the Alberta Non-Partisan League, formed in 1916. Henry Wise Wood led the party at the time of the 1921 election, although he did not run himself. The loosely organized farmer candidates running in rural constituencies captured a majority of the seats. The party was allied with Labour candidates, so it did not contest urban ridings, aside from one in Edmonton. Wood did not want the job as premier so the farmers were forced to shop around. UFA lawyer John Brownlee was asked first but declined. UFA executive member Herbert Greenfield, the second choice, became the new premier, although he too had not run in the election so had to await success in a by-election to take his seat.
Greenfield resigned four years later because he was often absent due to illness and lost much of his energy due to the death of his wife shortly after the election.

John Brownlee, who had previously been offered the job, succeeded Greenfield. Brownlee&#x27;s reign as government leader was troubled by the onset of the Great Depression. He resigned in scandal after he was accused of sexual acts with a minor in the Attorney General&#x27;s office. This and another scandalous divorce by UFA MLA Oran McPherson, speaker of the Legislative Assembly, gave the United Farmers an image of moral decay. In 1934 Richard Reid replaced Brownlee but served as premier for less than two years, leading the United Farmers government into total defeat at the hands of the new Social Credit party.

=== Social Credit 1935–1971 ===
Albertans turned away from the United Farmers government and began to follow evangelical radio preacher William Aberhart, known as Bible Bill. The Social Credit party had been founded in 1932. Voters flocked to the radical monetary reforms proposed by Aberhart and British SC theorist Clifford Douglas, looking for an escape to the Great Depression. Social Credit was elected with a majority (54 percent of the vote) in the 1935 election completely wiping out the United Farmers representation (although the UFA did receive 11 percent of the vote). Aberhart had difficulty implementing the Social Credit theory and his popularity began to decline. His government almost fell during a 1936 caucus rebellion, in which his own MLAs forced him to promise to try to reform the banking system. But it rebounded and in the 1940 election it garnered more votes than any other party and also captured a large majority of the seats. Aberhart died in 1943; he is the only premier to die in office in Alberta&#x27;s history.

Ernest Manning succeeded Aberhart as premier. Under Manning, Social Credit moved away from the monetary theory of Douglas and towards traditional conservatism. Manning led the party through seven-straight massive majorities, (although in 1955 his government received barely more seats than Aberhart had received in 1940, due to a strong but short-lived Liberal drive). During his premiership, his government abolished the hybrid STV/Instant-runoff voting system the province had been using since 1924, and the government received a windfall of seats in the 1959 election. After 24 years as premier, Manning resigned in 1967.

Harry Strom, a long time cabinet minister, replaced Manning and led the party to defeat in the 1971 election at the hands of the Progressive Conservatives under Peter Lougheed. Strom and his government looked old and tired and out of touch compared to the new Progressive Conservatives.

=== Progressive Conservative 1971–2015===
The fourth government of Alberta was first led by Peter Lougheed, defeating the 36-year reign of Social Credit in 1971.

Peter Lougheed served as premier, winning four elections, until 1985 when he retired from public office. Some of Lougheed&#x27;s notable accomplishments were the limited Alberta Bill of Rights, and the Heritage Trust Fund.

Don Getty, one of Lougheed&#x27;s long-time cabinet ministers, returned to politics to win the leadership of the party. Getty&#x27;s premiership was endorsed by a win in the 1986 general election that saw the NDP climb to 16 seats as the official opposition. Getty&#x27;s reign became very unpopular as he led Alberta into large deficit spending, and marked an era of big government that, some said, the province could not afford. In the 1989 election he was defeated in his Edmonton-Whitemud riding, while his party still won a majority. He sat in the gallery as premier, until he won a seat in a by-election in Stettler. His refusal to leave as premier helped Laurence Decore&#x27;s Liberals skyrocket in popularity. Getty resigned and was replaced in a bitter leadership battle by Ralph Klein.

Ralph Klein, the former mayor of Calgary, led the party into the 1993 election, promising a new era of debt reduction and fiscal accountability. He walked away with a slim majority. Ralph Klein&#x27;s folksy appeal helped the Progressive Conservatives renew themselves. He led the party through two elections, gaining in popularity each time. The price of oil rebounded and the government, despite low rates of taxes on the wealthy and corporations, was showing a surplus of $3 billion every year. In early 2004, Klein announced that the Alberta debt had been paid in full. He was rewarded by voters in the 2004 election, despite running a campaign with no new policies. His party lost a number of seats to the Liberals, and during the campaign he stated this would be his last election. In 2006 at a Progressive Conservative convention delegates forced him to pick a retirement date by giving him relatively low numbers in a leadership review.

Ed Stelmach succeeded Klein as premier, following his win of the leadership of the Alberta Progressive Conservative party in 2006. He won the 2008 provincial election, but, troubled by dissension within his party as well as lagging in polls behind the upstart Wildrose Party, resigned as the party celebrated its 40 years in power in 2011.

Alison Redford subsequently was elected party leader and became the first female premier of Alberta. Despite strong opposition from the Wildrose Party that most polls and media predicted would end the PC&#x27;s 41-year dynasty, Redford and the PC party won re-election in April 2012, making Redford Alberta&#x27;s first elected female premier. Due to a steep decline in approval ratings and a spending controversy, Alison Redford announced her resignation on March 19, 2014, as premier of Alberta, effective March 23.

Alberta Deputy Premier Dave Hancock was selected as premier and interim party leader by the Progressive Conservative caucus on March 20, 2014, and became premier on March 23, 2014.

Jim Prentice was elected as the permanent leader of the PC Party on September 6, 2014, and succeeded Hancock as premier on September 15, 2014. He turned the government around on a number of crucial issues, cancelling the closure of the Michener Centre, for example. He was elected to the constituency of Calgary-Foothill in an October 27, 2014 by-election, as the PC Party won the four by-elections held that day while the rival Wildrose Party did very poorly. Less than two months later, most of the Wildrose Party caucus—including leader Danielle Smith, crossed the floor to sit with the PC Party. However, Prentice government&#x27;s popularity dropped sharply by spring 2015, due to a budget that was unpopular among the political spectrum, with the collapse in PC support also attributed to falling oil prices and the past scandals under the Redford government. Prentice had over a year before he was obliged to dissolve the legislature, nonetheless he decided to call a snap election. On May 5, 2015, the PC Party&#x27;s 44 straight years of government ended as they lost 60 seats in the Legislature to fall to third place in the legislature, while the NDP won a majority government over the resurgent Wildrose Party which finished second and become the Official Opposition. Prentice resigned as party leader and as an MLA, leaving the PC Party with only 9 seats.

=== New Democratic Party 2015–2019===
On May 5, 2015, Rachel Notley successfully led the New Democratic party to a majority government in the 2015 Alberta general election, defeating the incumbent government led by Jim Prentice of the Progressive Conservative Party, with 54 seats and 41% of the popular vote and securing only the fourth change of government in Alberta&#x27;s political history.

Rachel Notley was appointed and sworn in as premier on May 24, 2015, following her party&#x27;s capturing of 54 out of 87 seats in the Legislature. The NDP&#x27;s surprise victory was attributed to the unpopularity of the Prentice government&#x27;s budget, a strong performance by Notley in the leaders&#x27; debates, and splitting of the right-wing vote between the PC and Wildrose parties. On May 22, 2015, Notley suspended a caucus member, leaving her party with 53 out of 87 seats, which did not change the balance of power in the legislature. The NDP held 52 seats at the time of the legislature&#x27;s dissolution in March 2019, and were defeated in the ensuing general election on April 16, 2019, making it the first one-mandate government in provincial history.

=== United Conservative Party 2019–present ===
On April 16, 2019, Jason Kenney successfully led the United Conservative Party to a majority government in the 2019 Alberta general election, defeating the incumbent government led by Rachel Notley of the New Democratic Party with 63 seats and 54.88% of the popular vote and securing only the fifth change of government in Alberta&#x27;s political history. Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, had entered provincial politics to become PC Party leader where he led its merger with Wildrose, and then won the leadership of the newly combined party, the UCP. As of 2022 Danielle Smith took office after Jason Kenney resigned for not enough support in his party.

<text>Île d&#x27;Orléans (; ) is an island located in the Saint Lawrence River about east of downtown Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. It was one of the first parts of the province to be colonized by the French, and a large percentage of French Canadians can trace ancestry to early residents of the island. The island has been described as the &quot;microcosm of traditional Quebec and as the birthplace of francophones in North America.&quot;

It has about 7,000 inhabitants, spread over six villages.

The island is accessible from the mainland via the Île d&#x27;Orléans Bridge from Beauport. Route 368 is the sole provincial route on the island, which crosses the bridge and circles the perimeter of the island. At the village of Sainte-Pétronille toward the western end of the island, a viewpoint overlooks the impressive &quot;Chute Montmorency&quot; (Montmorency Falls), as well as a panorama of the St. Lawrence River and Quebec City.

==Geography==

The Island of Orleans is situated between the Laurentian Plateau or Canadian Shield to the north and the Appalachian Mountains to the south. Its north-eastern point marks of the St Lawrence river middle estuary, where the fresh water begins to mix with salt water.

The island is separated from the mainland by two channels; to the north-west is the Île d&#x27;Orléans Channel and to the south-east is the Grands Voiliers Channel.

Of irregular form with jagged coves and capes, the Island of Orleans is long and wide at the widest point. It is in circumference, with a total surface area of . It has a hilly relief, small valleys, and gradual crests that reach a maximum height of about at Sainte-Pétronille and Saint-Laurent in the south.

The main streams of Île d&#x27;Orléans are: 
*Chenal des Grands Voiliers (SE side of the island)
*Chenal de l&#x27;Île d&#x27;Orléans (NW side of the island)
*Rivière Dauphine (Saint-Jean)
*Rivière Lafleur (Saint-Jean)
*Rivière Maheu (Saint-Laurent)
*Ruisseau du Moulin (Saint-François)
*Rivière du Moulin (Saint-Laurent)
*Rivière du Moulin (Saint-Pierre)
*Rivière Pot au Beurre (Sainte-Famille)
*Rivière de la Savane

Administratively, the island is within Quebec&#x27;s Capitale-Nationale region, and constitutes the L&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans Regional County Municipality. It is further subdivided in the municipalities of:
* Sainte-Famille-de-l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans
* Saint-François-de-l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans
* Saint-Jean-de-l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans
* Saint-Laurent-de-l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans
* Sainte-Pétronille
* Saint-Pierre-de-l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans

The entire island is part of the Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord federal electoral riding, and the Charlevoix–Côte-de-Beaupré provincial electoral riding.

==History==
The island had long been inhabited by Indigenous peoples. The Hurons called it &quot;Minigo&quot; (meaning &quot;Enchantress&quot;) because of its charm. The French explorer Jacques Cartier first set foot on the island in 1535 near the present-day village of Saint-François. And called it &quot;Île de Bascuz&quot; (from Bacchus) because of the abundance of wild grapes growing on the island. Officials later changed the name to Île d&#x27;Orléans in honour of the second son of King Francis I, who became Henri II, Duke of Orléans. The island was also known as &quot;Grande Île&quot;, &quot;Sainte-Marie&quot;, and &quot;Saint-Laurent&quot; for certain periods in the 17th and the 18th centuries.

Early French settlers, mostly from Normandy and other provinces in northwestern France, were attracted to the island because of its fertile soil. They colonized it according to the seigneurial system of New France, which is still evident in its layout by featuring residences close together with outlying long and narrow fields and a common. In 1661, the first parish of Sainte-Famille was founded, followed by another four parishes in 1679 and 1680. By 1685, there were 1205 mostly French inhabitants and 917 livestock.

In 1744, colonists completed the &quot;Chemin Royal&quot; (Royal Road), which encircles the entire island. Jean Mauvide, a surgeon for the King of France, built the &quot;Manoir Mauvide-Genest&quot; in 1734 as his residence. In 1759, it was occupied by British General James Wolfe when his forces occupied the island shortly before the Battle of the Plains of Abraham during the Seven Years&#x27; War in which Britain was victorious.

In the 19th and early 20th century, several boatbuilding yards operated on the island, especially in Saint-Laurent-de-l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans. Together with the thriving fishing industry of that era, they gave the island a maritime character.

In 1935 the Pont de l&#x27;Île was completed, and the bridge brought much more traffic. However, the island has maintained its pastoral image and historic character, with more than 600 buildings classified or recognized as heritage property. In 1990, the entire island was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

Today, the island is a mix of suburban communities and farms and is a popular destination for day trippers and bicyclists.
==Economy==
Since the days of the first French settlers, agriculture has been the main economic activity. Potatoes, strawberries, apples, blueberries, raspberries and maple syrup is produced. There is also viticulture and cheese production. The island, known as the &quot;Garden of Quebec&quot;, is still an essentially rural place famous locally for its produce, especially strawberries, apples, potatoes and wineries. Sugar maple stands produce maple syrup and other products.

While the old trades of fishing and boat building have been abandoned, the island&#x27;s rich cultural heritage and pastoral scenery has led to a flourishing tourism industry. It attracts more than 600,000 visitors each year. Numerous bed-and-breakfast inns, regional cuisine restaurants, roadside fruit stands, art galleries and craft shops also attract visitors:
* Sainte-Famille-de-l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans the church of the Sainte-Famille from 1743 and the interpretation centers Maison de nos Aïeux and Maison Drouin;
* Saint-François-de-l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans the observation tower, the beach and the chocolate factory on Île d&#x27;Orléans;
* Saint-Jean-de-l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans the café &quot;La Boulange&quot;, the Catholic church, the promenade on the shore of the St. Lawrence and the Mauvide-Genest Manor (National Historic Site of the Canada);
* Saint-Laurent-de-l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans the &quot;La Chalouperie&quot; museum at the maritime park and the Île d&#x27;Orléans marina;
* Sainte-Pétronille the island&#x27;s chocolate factory and the painter&#x27;s house Horatio Walker;
* Saint-Pierre-de-l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans the Félix Leclerc space and the Bellevue with the giant sculpture of Félix Leclerc.

Also for years there has been a strong movement of the inhabitants of city of Quebec, who own second homes around the periphery of the island of Orleans.

== Notable people ==
Félix Leclerc is buried in Saint-Pierre. There is the Espace Félix Leclerc, today a museum and performance hall, in his honor.

== In art and culture ==
Several chansonniers have made reference to Île d&#x27;Orléans in their songs, in particular:
* Yves Duteil refers to the island in his song &quot;La langue de chez nous&quot; (Our language).
* Félix Leclerc will make a song of it : &quot;Le Tour de l&#x27;île&quot; (The Island Tour).
* Jean-Pierre Ferland refers to the island in &quot;Chanson pour Félix&quot; (Song for Félix)
* Sylvain Lelièvre refers to the island in his song &quot;Le fleuve&quot; (The river)
* Monique Leyrac refers to the island in her song &quot;La fille de l&#x27;île&quot; (The Island Girl)
* Tire le Coyote refers to the island in his song &quot;Calfeutrer les failles&quot; (Caulk faults)

<text>Fraga (; ) is the major town of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Bajo Cinca () in the province of Huesca, Aragon, Spain. It is located by the river Cinca. According to the 2014 census, the municipality has a population of 14,926 inhabitants.

King Alfonso I of Aragon died at its walls in 1134 while trying to conquer it during the Battle of Fraga. It was conquered from the Moors by the Count Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona in 1149.

The local language, called &quot;Fragatí&quot;, is western Catalan.

Historically, there was a Jewish community in Fraga. Jews in Fraga enjoyed civil rights under Muslim rule, which was not always the case in other historical Spanish Jewish communities. They were given autonomy, including the right to defend themselves against attacks and the right to elect their representatives. The community ceased to exist due to the expulsion of the Muslims and 
Jews in 1492.

<doc id="70631" wikidata="Q6694" url="?curid=70631" title="Alexander von Humboldt">
<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt (14 September 1769 – 6 May 1859) was a German polymath, geographer, naturalist, explorer, and proponent of Romantic philosophy and science. He was the younger brother of the Prussian minister, philosopher, and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835). Humboldt&#x27;s quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography, while his advocacy of long-term systematic geophysical measurement pioneered modern geomagnetic and meteorological monitoring. Humboldt and Carl Ritter are both regarded as the founders of modern geography as they established it as an independent scientific discipline.

Between 1799 and 1804, Humboldt travelled extensively in the Americas, exploring and describing them for the first time from a non-Spanish European scientific point of view. His description of the journey was written up and published in several volumes over 21 years.

Humboldt resurrected the use of the word &quot;cosmos&quot; from the ancient Greek and assigned it to his multivolume treatise, &quot;Kosmos&quot;, in which he sought to unify diverse branches of scientific knowledge and culture. This important work also motivated a holistic perception of the universe as one interacting entity, which introduced concepts of ecology leading to ideas of environmentalism. In 1800, and again in 1831, he described scientifically, on the basis of observations generated during his travels, local impacts of development causing human-induced climate change.

Humboldt is seen as &quot;the father of ecology&quot; and &quot;the father of environmentalism&quot;.

==Early life, family and education==
Alexander von Humboldt was born in Berlin in Prussia on 14 September 1769. He was baptized as a baby in the Lutheran faith, with the Duke of Brunswick serving as godfather.

His father, Alexander Georg von Humboldt (1720-1779), belonged to a prominent German noble family from Pomerania. Although not one of the titled gentry, he was a major in the Prussian Army, who had served with the Duke of Brunswick. At age 42, Alexander Georg was rewarded for his services in the Seven Years&#x27; War with the post of royal chamberlain. He profited from the contract to lease state lotteries and tobacco sales. 

Alexander&#x27;s grandfather was Johann Paul von Humboldt (1684-1740), who married Sophia Dorothea von Schweder (1688-1749), daughter of Prussian General Adjutant Michael von Schweder (1663-1729). In 1766, his father, Alexander Georg married Maria Elisabeth Colomb, a well-educated woman and widow of Baron Friedrich Ernst von Holwede (1723-1765), with whom she had a son Heinrich Friedrich Ludwig (1762-1817). Alexander Georg and Maria Elisabeth had four children: two daughters, Karoline and Gabriele, who died young, and then two sons, Wilhelm and Alexander. Her first-born son, Wilhelm and Alexander&#x27;s half-brother, Rittmaster in the Gendarme regiment was something of a ne&#x27;er do well, not often mentioned in the family history.

Alexander Georg died in 1779, leaving the brothers Humboldt in the care of their emotionally distant mother. She had high ambitions for Alexander and his older brother Wilhelm, hiring excellent tutors, who were Enlightenment thinkers, including Kantian physician Marcus Herz and botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow, who became one of the most important botanists in Germany. Humboldt&#x27;s mother expected them to become civil servants of the Prussian state. The money left to Alexander&#x27;s mother by Baron Holwede became instrumental in funding Alexander&#x27;s explorations after her death; contributing more than 70% of his private income.
Due to his youthful penchant for collecting and labeling plants, shells, and insects, Alexander received the playful title of &quot;the little apothecary&quot;. Marked for a political career, Alexander studied finance for six months in 1787 at the University of Frankfurt (Oder), which his mother might have chosen less for its academic excellence than its closeness to their home in Berlin. On 25 April 1789, he matriculated at the University of Göttingen, then known for the lectures of C. G. Heyne and anatomist J. F. Blumenbach. His brother Wilhelm was already a student at Göttingen, but they did not interact much, since their intellectual interests were quite different. His vast and varied interests were by this time fully developed.

At the University of Göttingen, Humboldt met Steven Jan van Geuns, a Dutch medical student, with whom he travelled to the Rhine in the fall of 1789. In Mainz, they met Georg Forster, a naturalist who had been with Captain James Cook on his second voyage. Humboldt&#x27;s scientific excursion resulted in his 1790 treatise &quot;Mineralogische Beobachtungen über einige Basalte am Rhein&quot; (Brunswick, 1790) (&quot;Mineralogic Observations on Several Basalts on the River Rhine&quot;). The following year, 1790, Humboldt returned to Mainz to embark with Forster on a journey to England, Humboldt&#x27;s first sea voyage, the Netherlands, and France. In England, he met Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, who had travelled with Captain Cook; Banks showed Humboldt his huge herbarium, with specimens of the South Sea tropics. The scientific friendship between Banks and Humboldt lasted until Banks&#x27;s death in 1820, and the two shared botanical specimens for study. Banks also mobilized his scientific contacts in later years to aid Humboldt&#x27;s work.

Humboldt&#x27;s passion for travel was of long standing. He devoted to prepare himself as a scientific explorer. With this emphasis, he studied commerce and foreign languages at Hamburg, geology at Freiberg School of Mines in 1791 under A.G. Werner, leader of the Neptunist school of geology; from anatomy at Jena under J.C. Loder; and astronomy and the use of scientific instruments under F.X. von Zach and J.G. Köhler. At Freiberg, he met a number of men who were to prove important to him in his later career, including Spaniard Manuel del Río, who became director of the School of Mines the crown established in Mexico; Christian Leopold von Buch, who became a regional geologist; and, most importantly, , who became Humboldt&#x27;s tutor and close friend. During this period, his brother Wilhelm married, but Alexander did not attend the nuptials.

==Travels and work in Europe==
Humboldt graduated from the Freiberg School of Mines in 1792 and was appointed to a Prussian government position in the Department of Mines as an inspector in Bayreuth and the Fichtel Mountains. Humboldt was excellent at his job, with production of gold ore in his first year outstripping the previous eight years. During his period as a mine inspector, Humboldt demonstrated his deep concern for the men laboring in the mines. He opened a free school for miners, paid for out of his own pocket, which became an unchartered government training school for labor. He also sought to establish an emergency relief fund for miners, aiding them following accidents.

Humboldt&#x27;s researches into the vegetation of the mines of Freiberg led to the publication in Latin (1793) of his &quot;Florae Fribergensis, accedunt Aphorismi ex Doctrina, Physiologiae Chemicae Plantarum&quot;, which was a compendium of his botanical researches. That publication brought him to the attention of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who had met Humboldt at the family home when Alexander was a boy, but Goethe was now interested in meeting the young scientist to discuss metamorphism of plants. An introduction was arranged by Humboldt&#x27;s brother, who lived in the university town of Jena, not far from Goethe. Goethe had developed his own extensive theories on comparative anatomy. Working before Darwin, he believed that animals had an internal force, an &quot;urform&quot;, that gave them a basic shape and then they were further adapted to their environment by an external force. Humboldt urged him to publish his theories. Together, the two discussed and expanded these ideas. Goethe and Humboldt soon became close friends.

Humboldt often returned to Jena in the years that followed. Goethe remarked about Humboldt to friends that he had never met anyone so versatile. Humboldt&#x27;s drive served as an inspiration for Goethe. In 1797, Humboldt returned to Jena for three months. During this time, Goethe moved from his residence in Weimar to reside in Jena. Together, Humboldt and Goethe attended university lectures on anatomy and conducted their own experiments. One experiment involved hooking up a frog leg to various metals. They found no effect until the moisture of Humboldt&#x27;s breath triggered a reaction that caused the frog leg to leap off the table. Humboldt described this as one of his favorite experiments because it was as if he were &quot;breathing life into&quot; the leg.

During this visit, a thunderstorm killed a farmer and his wife. Humboldt obtained their corpses and analyzed them in the anatomy tower of the university.
In 1794, Humboldt was admitted to the famous group of intellectuals and cultural leaders of Weimar Classicism. Goethe and Schiller were the key figures at the time. Humboldt contributed (7 June 1795) to Schiller&#x27;s new periodical, &quot;Die Horen&quot;, a philosophical allegory entitled &quot;(The Life Force, or the Rhodian Genius).&quot; In this short piece, the only literary story Humboldt ever authored, he tried to summarize the often contradictory results of the thousands of Galvanic experiments he had undertaken.

In 1792 and 1797, Humboldt was in Vienna; in 1795 he made a geological and botanical tour through Switzerland and Italy. Although this service to the state was regarded by him as only an apprenticeship to the service of science, he fulfilled its duties with such conspicuous ability that not only did he rise rapidly to the highest post in his department, but he was also entrusted with several important diplomatic missions.

Neither brother attended the funeral of their mother on 19 November 1796. Humboldt had not hidden his aversion to his mother, with one correspondent writing of him after her death, &quot;her death... must be particularly welcomed by you&quot;. After severing his official connections, he awaited an opportunity to fulfill his long-cherished dream of travel.

Humboldt was able to spend more time on writing up his research. He had used his own body for experimentation on muscular irritability, recently discovered by Luigi Galvani and published his results, (Berlin, 1797) (&quot;Experiments on Stimulated Muscle and Nerve Fibres&quot;), enriched in the French translation with notes by Blumenbach.

==Spanish American expedition, 1799–1804==
===Seeking a foreign expedition===
With the financial resources to fund his scientific travels, he sought a ship on a major expedition. Meantime, he went to Paris, where his brother Wilhelm was now living. Paris was a great center of scientific learning and his brother and sister-in-law Caroline were well connected in those circles. Louis-Antoine de Bougainville urged Humboldt to accompany him on a major expedition, likely to last five years, but the French revolutionary Directoire placed Nicolas Baudin at the head of it rather than the aging scientific traveler. On the postponement of Captain Baudin&#x27;s proposed voyage of circumnavigation due to continuing warfare in Europe, which Humboldt had been officially invited to accompany, Humboldt was deeply disappointed. He had already selected scientific instruments for his voyage. He did, however, have a stroke of luck with meeting Aimé Bonpland, the botanist and physician for the voyage.

Discouraged, the two left Paris for Marseille, where they hoped to join Napoleon Bonaparte in Egypt, but North Africans were in revolt against the French invasion in Egypt and French authorities refused permission to travel. Humboldt and Bonpland eventually found their way to Madrid, where their luck changed spectacularly.

===Spanish royal authorization, 1799===

In Madrid, Humboldt sought authorization to travel to Spain&#x27;s realms in the Americas; he was aided in obtaining it by the German representative of Saxony at the royal Bourbon court. Baron Forell had an interest in mineralogy and science endeavors and was inclined to help Humboldt. At that time, the Bourbon Reforms sought to reform administration of the realms and revitalize their economies. At the same time, the Spanish Enlightenment was in florescence. For Humboldt &quot;the confluent effect of the Bourbon revolution in government and the Spanish Enlightenment had created ideal conditions for his venture&quot;.

The Bourbon monarchy had already authorized and funded expeditions, with the Botanical Expedition to the Viceroyalty of Peru to Chile and Peru (1777–88), New Granada (1783–1816), New Spain (Mexico) (1787–1803), and the Malaspina Expedition (1789–94). These were lengthy, state-sponsored enterprises to gather information about plants and animals from the Spanish realms, assess economic possibilities, and provide plants and seeds for the Royal Botanical Garden in Madrid (founded 1755). These expeditions took naturalists and artists, who created visual images as well as careful written observations as well as collecting seeds and plants themselves. Crown officials as early as 1779 issued and systematically distributed &quot;Instructions concerning the most secure and economic means to transport live plants by land and sea from the most distant countries&quot;, with illustrations, including one for the crates to transport seeds and plants.

When Humboldt requested authorization from the crown to travel to Spanish America, most importantly, with his own financing, it was given positive response. Spain under the Habsburg monarchy had guarded its realms against foreigner travelers and intruders. The Bourbon monarch was open to Humboldt&#x27;s proposal. Spanish Foreign Minister Don Mariano Luis de Urquijo received the formal proposal and Humboldt was presented to the monarch in March 1799. Humboldt was granted access to crown officials and written documentation on Spain&#x27;s empire. With Humboldt&#x27;s experience working for the absolutist Prussian monarchy as a government mining official, Humboldt had both the academic training and experience of working well within a bureaucratic structure.
Before leaving Madrid in 1799, Humboldt and Bonpland visited the Natural History Museum, which held results of Martín Sessé y Lacasta and José Mariano Mociño&#x27;s botanical expedition to New Spain. Humboldt and Bonpland met Hipólito Ruiz López and José Antonio Pavón y Jiménez of the royal expedition to Peru and Chile in person in Madrid and examined their botanical collections.

===Venezuela, 1799–1800===
Armed with authorization from the King of Spain, Humboldt and Bonpland made haste to sail, taking the ship &quot;Pizarro&quot; from A Coruña, on 5 June 1799. The ship stopped six days on the island of Tenerife, where Humboldt climbed the volcano Teide, and then sailed on to the New World, landing at Cumaná, Venezuela, on 16 July.

The ship&#x27;s destination was not originally Cumaná, but an outbreak of typhoid on board meant that the captain changed course from Havana to land in northern South America. Humboldt had not mapped out a specific plan of exploration, so that the change did not upend a fixed itinerary. He later wrote that the diversion to Venezuela made possible his explorations along the Orinoco River to the border of Portuguese Brazil. With the diversion, the &quot;Pizarro&quot; encountered two large dugout canoes each carrying 18 Guayaqui Indians. The &quot;Pizarro&quot;″s captain accepted the offer of one of them to serve as pilot. Humboldt hired this Indian, named Carlos del Pino, as a guide.

Venezuela from the 16th to the 18th centuries was a relative backwater compared to the seats of the Spanish viceroyalties based in New Spain (Mexico) and Peru, but during the Bourbon reforms, the northern portion of Spanish South America was reorganized administratively, with the 1777 establishment of a captaincy-general based at Caracas. A great deal of information on the new jurisdiction had already been compiled by François de Pons, but was not published until 1806.

Rather than describe the administrative center of Caracas, Humboldt started his researches with the valley of Aragua, where export crops of sugar, coffee, cacao, and cotton were cultivated. Cacao plantations were the most profitable, as world demand for chocolate rose. It is here that Humboldt is said to have developed his idea of human-induced climate change. Investigating evidence of a rapid fall in the water level of the valley&#x27;s Lake Valencia, Humboldt credited the desiccation to the clearance of tree cover and to the inability of the exposed soils to retain water. With their clear cutting of trees, the agriculturalists were removing the woodland&#x27;s &quot;threefold&quot; moderating influence upon temperature: cooling shade, evaporation and radiation.

Humboldt visited the mission at Caripe and explored the Guácharo cavern, where he found the oilbird, which he was to make known to science as &quot;Steatornis caripensis&quot;. He also described the Guanoco asphalt lake as &quot;The spring of the good priest&quot; (&quot;Quelle des guten Priesters&quot;). Returning to Cumaná, Humboldt observed, on the night of 11–12 November, a remarkable meteor shower (the Leonids). He proceeded with Bonpland to Caracas where he climbed the Avila mount with the young poet Andrés Bello, the former tutor of Simón Bolívar, who later became the leader of independence in northern South America. Humboldt met the Venezuelan Bolívar himself in 1804 in Paris and spent time with him in Rome. The documentary record does not support the supposition that Humboldt inspired Bolívar to participate in the struggle for independence, but it does indicate Bolívar&#x27;s admiration for Humboldt&#x27;s production of new knowledge on Spanish America.

In February 1800, Humboldt and Bonpland left the coast with the purpose of exploring the course of the Orinoco River and its tributaries. This trip, which lasted four months and covered of wild and largely uninhabited country, had an aim of establishing the existence of the Casiquiare canal (a communication between the water systems of the rivers Orinoco and Amazon). Although, unbeknownst to Humboldt, this existence had been established decades before, his expedition had the important results of determining the exact position of the bifurcation, and documenting the life of several native tribes such as the Maipures and their extinct rivals the Atures (several words of the latter tribe were transferred to Humboldt by one parrot). Around 19 March 1800, Humboldt and Bonpland discovered dangerous electric eels, whose shock could kill a man. To catch them, locals suggested they drive wild horses into the river, which brought the eels out from the river mud, and resulted in a violent confrontation of eels and horses, some of which died. Humboldt and Bonpland captured and dissected some eels, which retained their ability to shock; both received potentially dangerous electric shocks during their investigations. The encounter made Humboldt think more deeply about electricity and magnetism, typical of his ability to extrapolate from an observation to more general principles. Humboldt returned to the incident in several of his later writings, including his travelogue &quot;Personal Narrative&quot; (1814–29), &quot;Views of Nature&quot; (1807), and &quot;Aspects of Nature&quot; (1849).

Two months later, they explored the territory of the Maipures and that of the then-recently extinct Atures Indians. Humboldt laid to rest the persistent myth of Walter Raleigh&#x27;s Lake Parime by proposing that the seasonal flooding of the Rupununi savannah had been misidentified as a lake.

===Cuba, 1800, 1804===

On 24 November 1800, the two friends set sail for Cuba, landing on 19 December, where they met fellow botanist and plant collector John Fraser. Fraser and his son had been shipwrecked off the Cuban coast, and did not have a license to be in the Spanish Indies. Humboldt, who was already in Cuba, interceded with crown officials in Havana, as well as giving them money and clothing. Fraser obtained permission to remain in Cuba and explore. Humboldt entrusted Fraser with taking two cases of Humboldt and Bonpland&#x27;s botanical specimens to England when he returned, for eventual conveyance to the German botanist Willdenow in Berlin. Humboldt and Bonpland stayed in Cuba until 5 March 1801, when they left for the mainland of northern South America again, arriving there on 30 March.

Humboldt is considered to be the &quot;second discoverer of Cuba&quot; due to the scientific and social research he conducted on this Spanish colony. During an initial three-month stay at Havana, his first tasks were to survey that city properly and the nearby towns of Guanabacoa, Regla, and Bejucal. He befriended Cuban landowner and thinker Francisco de Arango y Parreño; together they visited the area in south Havana, the valleys of Matanzas Province, and the Valley of the Sugar Mills in Trinidad. Those three areas were, at the time, the first frontier of sugar production in the island. During those trips, Humboldt collected statistical information on Cuba&#x27;s population, production, technology and trade, and with Arango, made suggestions for enhancing them. He predicted that the agricultural and commercial potential of Cuba was huge and could be vastly improved with proper leadership in the future.

On their way back to Europe from the Americas, Humboldt and Bonpland stopped again in Cuba, leaving from the port of Veracruz and arriving in Cuba on 7 January 1804, staying until 29 April 1804. In Cuba, he collected plant material and made extensive notes. During this time, he socialized with his scientific and landowner friends, conducted mineralogical surveys, and finished his vast collection of the island&#x27;s flora and fauna that he eventually published as &quot;Essai politique sur l&#x27;îsle de Cuba&quot;.

===The Andes, 1801–1803===
After their first stay in Cuba of three months, they returned to the mainland at Cartagena de Indias (now in Colombia), a major center of trade in northern South America. Ascending the swollen stream of the Magdalena River to Honda, they arrived in Bogotá on 6 July 1801, where they met the Spanish botanist José Celestino Mutis, head of the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada, staying there until 8 September 1801. Mutis was generous with his time and gave Humboldt access to the huge pictorial record he had compiled since 1783. Mutis was based in Bogotá, but as with other Spanish expeditions, he had access to local knowledge and a workshop of artists, who created highly accurate and detailed images. This type of careful recording meant that even if specimens were not available to study at a distance, &quot;because the images travelled, the botanists did not have to&quot;. Humboldt was astounded at Mutis&#x27;s accomplishment; when Humboldt published his first volume on botany, he dedicated it to Mutis &quot;as a simple mark of our admiration and acknowledgement&quot;.

Humboldt had hopes of connecting with the French sailing expedition of Baudin, now finally underway, so Bonpland and Humboldt hurried to Ecuador. They crossed the frozen ridges of the Cordillera Real and reached Quito on 6 January 1802, after a tedious and difficult journey.

Their stay in Ecuador was marked by the ascent of Pichincha and their climb of Chimborazo, where Humboldt and his party reached an altitude of . This was a world record at the time (for a westerner—Incas had reached much higher altitudes centuries before), but 1000 feet short of the summit. Humboldt&#x27;s journey concluded with an expedition to the sources of the Amazon &quot;en route&quot; for Lima, Peru.

At Callao, the main port for Peru, Humboldt observed the transit of Mercury on 9 November and studied the fertilizing properties of guano, rich in nitrogen, the subsequent introduction of which into Europe was due mainly to his writings.

===New Spain (Mexico), 1803–1804===


Humboldt and Bonpland had not intended to go to New Spain, but when they were unable to join a voyage to the Pacific, they left the Ecuadorian port of Guayaquil and headed for Acapulco on Mexico&#x27;s west coast. Even before Humboldt and Bonpland started on their way to New Spain&#x27;s capital on Mexico&#x27;s central plateau, Humboldt realized the captain of the vessel that brought them to Acapulco had reckoned its location incorrectly. Since Acapulco was the main west-coast port and the terminus of the Asian trade from the Spanish Philippines, having accurate maps of its location was extremely important. Humboldt set up his instruments, surveying the deep-water bay of Acapulco, to determine its longitude.

Humboldt and Bonpland landed in Acapulco on 15 February 1803, and from there they went to Taxco, a silver-mining town in modern Guerrero. In April 1803, he visited Cuernavaca, Morelos. Impressed by its climate, he nicknamed the city the &quot;City of Eternal Spring&quot;. Humboldt and Bonpland arrived in Mexico City, having been officially welcomed via a letter from the king&#x27;s representative in New Spain, Viceroy Don José de Iturrigaray. Humboldt was also given a special passport to travel throughout New Spain and letters of introduction to intendants, the highest officials in New Spain&#x27;s administrative districts (intendancies). This official aid to Humboldt allowed him to have access to crown records, mines, landed estates, canals, and Mexican antiquities from the prehispanic era. Humboldt read the writings of Bishop-elect of the important diocese of Michoacan Manuel Abad y Queipo, a classical liberal, that were directed to the crown for the improvement of New Spain.

They spent the year in the viceroyalty, traveling to different Mexican cities in the central plateau and the northern mining region. The first journey was from Acapulco to Mexico City, through what is now the Mexican state of Guerrero. The route was suitable only for mule train, and all along the way, Humboldt took measurements of elevation. When he left Mexico a year later in 1804, from the east coast port of Veracruz, he took a similar set of measures, which resulted in a chart in the &quot;Political Essay&quot;, the physical plan of Mexico with the dangers of the road from Acapulco to Mexico City, and from Mexico City to Veracruz. This visual depiction of elevation was part of Humboldt&#x27;s general insistence that the data he collected be presented in a way more easily understood than statistical charts. A great deal of his success in gaining a more general readership for his works was his understanding that &quot;anything that has to do with extent or quantity can be represented geometrically. Statistical projections [charts and graphs], which speak to the senses without tiring the intellect have the advantage of bringing attention to a large number of important facts&quot;.

Humboldt was impressed with Mexico City, which at the time was the largest city in the Americas, and one that could be counted as modern. He declared &quot;no city of the new continent, without even excepting those of the United States, can display such great and solid scientific establishments as the capital of Mexico&quot;. He pointed to the Royal College of Mines, the Royal Botanical Garden and the Royal Academy of San Carlos as exemplars of a metropolitan capital in touch with the latest developments on the continent and insisting on its modernity. He also recognized important criollo savants in Mexico, including José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez, who died in 1799, just before Humboldt&#x27;s visit; Miguel Velásquez de León; and Antonio de León y Gama.

Humboldt spent time at the Valenciana silver mine in Guanajuato, central New Spain, at the time the most important in the Spanish empire. The bicentennial of his visit in Guanajuato was celebrated with a conference at the University of Guanajuato, with Mexican academics highlighting various aspects of his impact on the city. Humboldt could have simply examined the geology of the fabulously rich mine, but he took the opportunity to study the entire mining complex as well as analyze mining statistics of its output. His report on silver mining is a major contribution, and considered the strongest and best informed section of his &quot;Political Essay&quot;. Although Humboldt was himself a trained geologist and mining inspector, he drew on mining experts in Mexico. One was Fausto Elhuyar, then head of the General Mining Court in Mexico City, who, like Humboldt was trained in Freiberg. Another was Andrés Manuel del Río, director of Royal College of Mines, whom Humboldt knew when they were both students in Freiberg. The Bourbon monarchs had established the mining court and the college to elevate mining as a profession, since revenues from silver constituted the crown&#x27;s largest source of income. Humboldt also consulted other German mining experts, who were already in Mexico. While Humboldt was a welcome foreign scientist and mining expert, the Spanish crown had established fertile ground for Humboldt&#x27;s investigations into mining.

Spanish America&#x27;s ancient civilizations were a source of interest for Humboldt, who included images of Mexican manuscripts (or codices) and Inca ruins in his richly illustrated &quot;Vues des cordillères et monuments des peuples indigènes de l&#x27;Amerique&quot; (1810–1813), the most experimental of Humboldt&#x27;s publications, since it does not have &quot;a single ordering principle&quot; but his opinions and contentions based on observation. For Humboldt, a key question was the influence of climate on the development of these civilizations. When he published his &quot;Vues des cordillères&quot;, he included a color image of the Aztec calendar stone, which had been discovered buried in the main plaza of Mexico City in 1790, along with select drawings of the Dresden Codex and others he sought out later in European collections. His aim was to muster evidence that these pictorial and sculptural images could allow the reconstruction of prehispanic history. He sought out Mexican experts in the interpretation of sources from there, especially Antonio Pichardo, who was the literary executor of Antonio de León y Gama&#x27;s work. For American-born Spaniards (criollos) who were seeking sources of pride in Mexico&#x27;s ancient past, Humboldt&#x27;s recognition of these ancient works and dissemination in his publications was a boon. He read the work of exiled Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero, which celebrated Mexico&#x27;s prehispanic civilization, and which Humboldt invoked to counter the pejorative assertions about the new world by Buffon, de Pauw, and Raynal. Humboldt ultimately viewed both the prehispanic realms of Mexico and Peru as despotic and barbaric. However, he also drew attention to indigenous monuments and artifacts as cultural productions that had &quot;both ... historical &quot;and&quot; artistic significance&quot;.

One of his most widely read publications resulting from his travels and investigations in Spanish America was the &quot;Essai politique sur le royaum de la Nouvelle Espagne&quot;, quickly translated to English as &quot;Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain&quot; (1811). This treatise was the result of Humboldt&#x27;s own investigations as well as the generosity of Spanish colonial officials for statistical data.

===The United States, 1804===
Leaving from Cuba, Humboldt decided to take an unplanned short visit to the United States. Knowing that the current U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson, was himself a scientist, Humboldt wrote to him saying that he would be in the United States. Jefferson warmly replied, inviting him to visit the White House in the nation&#x27;s new capital. In his letter Humboldt had gained Jefferson&#x27;s interest by mentioning that he had discovered mammoth teeth near the Equator. Jefferson had previously written that he believed mammoths had never lived so far south. Humboldt had also hinted at his knowledge of New Spain.

Arriving in Philadelphia, which was a center of learning in the U.S., Humboldt met with some of the major scientific figures of the era, including chemist and anatomist Caspar Wistar, who pushed for compulsory smallpox vaccination, and botanist Benjamin Smith Barton, as well as physician Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, who wished to hear about cinchona bark from a South American tree, which cured fevers. Humboldt&#x27;s treatise on cinchona was published in English in 1821.

After arriving in Washington D.C, Humboldt held numerous intense discussions with Jefferson on both scientific matters and also his year-long stay in New Spain. Jefferson had only recently concluded the Louisiana Purchase, which now placed New Spain on the southwest border of the United States. The Spanish minister in Washington, D.C. had declined to furnish the U.S. government with information about Spanish territories, and access to the territories was strictly controlled. Humboldt was able to supply Jefferson with the latest information on the population, trade agriculture and military of New Spain. This information would later be the basis for his &quot;Essay on the Political Kingdom of New Spain&quot; (1810).

Jefferson was unsure of where the border of the newly-purchased Louisiana was precisely, and Humboldt wrote him a two-page report on the matter. Jefferson would later refer to Humboldt as &quot;the most scientific man of the age&quot;. Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury, said of Humboldt &quot;I was delighted and swallowed more information of various kinds in less than two hours than I had for two years past in all I had read or heard.&quot; Gallatin, in turn, supplied Humboldt with information he sought on the United States.

After six weeks, Humboldt set sail for Europe from the mouth of the Delaware and landed at Bordeaux on 3 August 1804.

===Travel diaries===
Humboldt kept a detailed diary of his sojourn to Spanish America, running some 4,000 pages, which he drew on directly for his multiple publications following the expedition. The leather-bound diaries themselves are now in Germany, having been returned from Russia to East Germany, where they were taken by the Red Army after World War II. Following German reunification, the diaries were returned to a descendant of Humboldt. For a time, there was concern about their being sold, but that was averted. A government-funded project to digitize the Spanish American expedition as well as his later Russian expedition has been undertaken (2014–2017) by the University of Potsdam and the German State Library–Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.

===Achievements of the Hispanic American expedition===

Humboldt&#x27;s decades&#x27; long endeavor to publish the results of this expedition not only resulted in multiple volumes, but also made his international reputation in scientific circles. Humboldt came to be well-known with the reading public as well, with popular, densely illustrated, condensed versions of his work in multiple languages. Bonpland, his fellow scientist and collaborator on the expedition, collected botanical specimens and preserved them, but unlike Humboldt who had a passion to publish, Bonpland had to be prodded to do the formal descriptions. Many scientific travelers and explorers produced huge visual records, which remained unseen by the general public until the late nineteenth century, in the case of the Malaspina Expedition, and even the late twentieth century, when Mutis&#x27;s botanical, some 12,000 drawings from New Granada, was published. Humboldt, by contrast, published immediately and continuously, using and ultimately exhausting his personal fortune, to produce both scientific and popular texts. Humboldt&#x27;s name and fame were made by his travels to Spanish America, particularly his publication of the &quot;Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain&quot;. His image as the premier European scientist was a later development.

For the Bourbon crown, which had authorized the expedition, the returns were not only tremendous in terms of sheer volume of data on their New World realms, but in dispelling the vague and pejorative assessments of the New World by Guillaume-Thomas Raynal, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, and William Robertson. The achievements of the Bourbon regime, especially in New Spain, were evident in the precise data Humboldt systematized and published.

This memorable expedition may be regarded as having laid the foundation of the sciences of physical geography, plant geography, and meteorology. Key to that was Humboldt&#x27;s meticulous and systematic measurement of phenomena with the most advanced instruments then available. He closely observed plant and animal species in situ, not just in isolation, noting all elements in relation to one other. He collected specimens of plants and animals, dividing the growing collection so that if a portion was lost, other parts might survive.

Humboldt saw the need for an approach to science that could account for the harmony of nature among the diversity of the physical world. For Humboldt, &quot;the unity of nature&quot; meant that it was the interrelation of all physical sciences—such as the conjoining between biology, meteorology and geology—that determined where specific plants grew. He found these relationships by unraveling myriad, painstakingly collected data, data extensive enough that it became an enduring foundation upon which others could base their work. Humboldt viewed nature holistically, and tried to explain natural phenomena without the appeal to religious dogma. He believed in the central importance of observation, and as a consequence had amassed a vast array of the most sophisticated scientific instruments then available. Each had its own velvet lined box and was the most accurate and portable of its time; nothing quantifiable escaped measurement. According to Humboldt, everything should be measured with the finest and most modern instruments and sophisticated techniques available, for that collected data was the basis of all scientific understanding.

This quantitative methodology would become known as Humboldtian science. Humboldt wrote &quot;Nature herself is sublimely eloquent. The stars as they sparkle in firmament fill us with delight and ecstasy, and yet they all move in orbit marked out with mathematical precision.&quot;
His &quot;Essay on the Geography of Plants&quot; (published first in French and then German, both in 1807) was based on the then novel idea of studying the distribution of organic life as affected by varying physical conditions. This was most famously depicted in his published cross-section of Chimborazo, approximately two feet by three feet (54 cm x 84 cm) color pictorial, he called &quot;Ein Naturgemälde der Anden&quot; and what is also called the Chimborazo Map. It was a fold-out at the back of the publication. Humboldt first sketched the map when he was in South America, which included written descriptions on either side of the cross-section of Chimborazo. These detailed the information on temperature, altitude, humidity, atmosphere pressure, and the animal and plants (with their scientific names) found at each elevation. Plants from the same genus appear at different elevations. The depiction is on an east-west axis going from the Pacific coast lowlands to the Andean range of which Chimborazo was a part, and the eastern Amazonian basin. Humboldt showed the three zones of coast, mountains, and Amazonia, based on his own observations, but he also drew on existing Spanish sources, particularly Pedro Cieza de León, which he explicitly referred to. The Spanish American scientist Francisco José de Caldas had also measured and observed mountain environments and had earlier come to similar ideas about environmental factors in the distribution of life forms. Humboldt was thus not putting forward something entirely new, but it is argued that his finding is not derivative either. The Chimborazo map displayed complex information in an accessible fashion. The map was the basis for comparison with other major peaks. &quot;The Naturgemälde showed for the first time that nature was a global force with corresponding climate zones across continents.&quot; Another assessment of the map is that it &quot;marked the beginning of a new era of environmental science, not only of mountain ecology but also of global-scale biogeophysical patterns and processes.&quot;

By his delineation (in 1817) of isothermal lines, he at once suggested the idea and devised the means of comparing the climatic conditions of various countries. He first investigated the rate of decrease in mean temperature with the increase in elevation above sea level, and afforded, by his inquiries regarding the origin of tropical storms, the earliest clue to the detection of the more complicated law governing atmospheric disturbances in higher latitudes. This was a major contribution to climatology.

His discovery of the decrease in intensity of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field from the poles to the equator was communicated to the Paris Institute in a memoir read by him on 7 December 1804. Its importance was attested by the speedy emergence of rival claims.

His services to geology were based on his attentive study of the volcanoes of the Andes and Mexico, which he observed and sketched, climbed, and measured with a variety of instruments. By climbing Chimborazo, he established an altitude record which became the basis for measurement of other volcanoes in the Andes and the Himalayas. As with other aspects of his investigations, he developed methods to show his synthesized results visually, using the graphic method of geologic-cross sections. He showed that volcanoes fell naturally into linear groups, presumably corresponding with vast subterranean fissures; and by his demonstration of the igneous origin of rocks previously held to be of aqueous formation, he contributed largely to the elimination of erroneous views, such as Neptunism.

Humboldt was a significant contributor to cartography, creating maps, particularly of New Spain, that became the template for later mapmakers in Mexico. His careful recording of latitude and longitude led to accurate maps of Mexico, the port of Acapulco, the port of Veracruz, and the Valley of Mexico, and a map showing trade patterns among continents. His maps also included schematic information on geography, converting areas of administrative districts (intendancies) using proportional squares. The U.S. was keen to see his maps and statistics on New Spain, since they had implication for territorial claims following the Louisiana Purchase. Later in life, Humboldt published three volumes (1836–39) examining sources that dealt with the early voyages to the Americas, pursuing his interest in nautical astronomy in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. His research yielded the origin of the name &quot;America&quot;, put on a map of the Americas by Martin Waldseemüller.

Humboldt conducted a census of the indigenous and European inhabitants in New Spain, publishing a schematized drawing of racial types and populations distribution, grouping them by region and social characteristics. He estimated the population to be six million individuals. He estimated Indians to be forty percent of New Spain&#x27;s population, but their distribution being uneven; the most dense were in the center and south of Mexico, the least dense in the north. He presented these data in chart form, for easier understanding. He also surveyed the non-Indian population, categorized as Whites (Spaniards), &quot;Negroes&quot;, and castes (&quot;castas&quot;). American-born Spaniards, so-called &quot;creoles&quot; had been painting depictions of mixed-race family groupings in the eighteenth century, showing father of one racial category, mother of another, and the offspring in a third category in hierarchical order, so racial hierarchy was an essential way elites viewed Mexican society. Humboldt reported that American-born Spaniards were legally racial equals of those born in Spain, but the crown policy since the Bourbons took the Spanish throne privileged those born in Iberia. Humboldt observed that &quot;the most miserable European, without education and without intellectual cultivation, thinks himself superior to whites born in the new continent&quot;. The truth in this assertion, and the conclusions derived from them, have been often disputed as superficial, or politically motivated, by some authors, considering that between 40% and 60% of high offices in the new world were held by creoles.
The enmity between some creoles and the peninsular-born whites increasingly became an issue in the late period of Spanish rule, with creoles increasingly alienated from the crown. Humboldt&#x27;s assessment was that royal government abuses and the example of a new model of rule in the United States were eroding the unity of whites in New Spain. Humboldt&#x27;s writings on race in New Spain were shaped by the memorials of the classical liberal, enlightened Bishop-elect of Michoacán, Manuel Abad y Queipo, who personally presented Humboldt with his printed memorials to the Spanish crown critiquing social and economic conditions and his recommendations for eliminating them.

One scholar says that his writings contain fantastical descriptions of America, while leaving out its inhabitants, stating that Humboldt, coming from the Romantic school of thought, believed &#x27;... nature is perfect till man deforms it with care&#x27;. The further assessment is that he largely neglected the human societies amidst nature. Views of indigenous peoples as &#x27;savage&#x27; or &#x27;unimportant&#x27; leaves them out of the historical picture. Other scholars counter that Humboldt dedicated large parts of his work to describing the conditions of slaves, indigenous peoples, mixed-race castas, and society in general. He often showed his disgust for the slavery and inhumane conditions in which indigenous peoples and others were treated and he often criticized Spanish colonial policies.

Humboldt was not primarily an artist, but he could draw well, allowing him to record a visual record of particular places and their natural environment. Many of his drawings became the basis for illustrations of his many scientific and general publications. Artists whom Humboldt influenced, such as Johann Moritz Rugendas, followed in his path and painted the same places Humboldt had visited and recorded, such as the basalt formations in Mexico, which was an illustration in his &quot;Vues des Cordillères&quot;.

The editing and publication of the encyclopedic mass of scientific, political and archaeological material that had been collected by him during his absence from Europe was now Humboldt&#x27;s most urgent desire. After a short trip to Italy with Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac for the purpose of investigating the law of magnetic declination and a stay of two and a half years in Berlin, in the spring of 1808, he settled in Paris. His purpose for being located there was to secure the scientific cooperation required for bringing his great work through the press. This colossal task, which he at first hoped would occupy but two years, eventually cost him twenty-one, and even then it remained incomplete.

==Scholarly and public recognition==

During his lifetime Humboldt became one of the most famous men in Europe. Academies, both native and foreign, were eager to elect him to their membership, the first being The American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, which he visited at the tail end of his travel through the Americas. He was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1805.

Over the years other learned societies in the U.S. elected him a member, including the American Antiquarian Society (Worcester, MA) in 1816; the Linnean Society of London in 1818; the New York Historical Society in 1820; a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822; the American Ethnological Society (New York) in 1843; and the American Geographical and Statistical Society, (New York) in 1856. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1810. The Royal Society, whose president Sir Joseph Banks had aided Humboldt as a young man, now welcomed him as a foreign member.

After Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government recognized him with high honors for his services to the nation. In 1827, the first President of Mexico, Guadalupe Victoria granted Humboldt Mexican citizenship and in 1859, the President of Mexico, Benito Juárez, named Humboldt a hero of the nation (&quot;benemérito de la nación&quot;). The gestures were purely honorary; he never returned to the Americas following his expedition.

Importantly for Humboldt&#x27;s long-term financial stability, King Frederick William III of Prussia conferred upon him the honor of the post of royal chamberlain, without at the time exacting the duties. The appointment had a pension of 2,500 thalers, afterwards doubled. This official stipend became his main source of income in later years when he exhausted his fortune on the publications of his research. Financial necessity forced his permanent relocation to Berlin in 1827 from Paris. In Paris he found not only scientific sympathy, but the social stimulus which his vigorous and healthy mind eagerly craved. He was equally in his element as the lion of the salons and as the savant of the Institut de France and the observatory.
On 12 May 1827 he settled permanently in Berlin, where his first efforts were directed towards the furtherance of the science of terrestrial magnetism. In 1827, he began giving public lectures in Berlin, which became the basis for his last major publication, &quot;Kosmos&quot; (1845–62).

For many years, it had been one of his favorite schemes to secure, by means of simultaneous observations at distant points, a thorough investigation of the nature and law of &quot;magnetic storms&quot; (a term invented by him to designate abnormal disturbances of Earth&#x27;s magnetism). The meeting at Berlin, on 18 September 1828, of a newly formed scientific association, of which he was elected president, gave him the opportunity of setting on foot an extensive system of research in combination with his diligent personal observations. His appeal to the Russian government, in 1829, led to the establishment of a line of magnetic and meteorological stations across northern Asia. Meanwhile, his letter to the Duke of Sussex, then (April 1836) president of the Royal Society, secured for the undertaking, the wide basis of the British dominions.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Eleventh Edition, observes, &quot;Thus that scientific conspiracy of nations which is one of the noblest fruits of modern civilization was by his exertions first successfully organized&quot;. However, earlier examples of international scientific cooperation exist, notably the 18th-century observations of the transits of Venus.

In 1856, U.S. diplomat John Bigelow published &quot;Memoir of the Life and Public Services of John Charles Fremont&quot;. He dedicated it &quot;To Alexander von Humboldt, this memoir of one whose genius he was among the first to discover and acknowledge, is respectfully inscribed by The Author.&quot;

In 1869, the 100th year of his birth, Humboldt&#x27;s fame was so great that cities all over America celebrated his birth with large festivals. In New York City, a bust of his head was unveiled in Central Park.

Scholars have speculated about the reasons for Humboldt&#x27;s declining renown among the public. Sandra Nichols has argued that there are three reasons for this:
*First, a trend towards specialization in scholarship. Humboldt was a generalist who connected many disciplines in his work. Today, academics have become more and more focused on narrow fields of work. Humboldt combined ecology, geography and even social sciences. 
*Second, a change in writing style. Humboldt&#x27;s works, which were considered essential to a library in 1869, had flowery prose that fell out of fashion. One critic said they had a &quot;laborious picturesqueness&quot;. Humboldt himself said that, &quot;If I only knew how to describe adequately how and what I felt, I might, after this long journey of mine, really be able to give happiness to people. The disjointed life I lead makes me hardly certain of my way of writing&quot;.
*Third, a rising anti-German sentiment in the late 1800s and the early 1900s due to heavy German immigration to the United States and later World War 1. On the eve of the 1959 hundredth anniversary of the death of Humboldt, the government of West Germany planned significant celebrations in conjunction with nations that Humboldt visited.

==Expedition in Russia, 1829==
In 1811, and again in 1818, projects of Asiatic exploration were proposed to Humboldt, first by Tsar Nicholas I&#x27;s Russian government, and afterwards by the Prussian government; but on each occasion, untoward circumstances interposed. It was not until he had begun his sixtieth year that he resumed his early role of traveler in the interests of science.

The Russian Foreign Minister, Count Georg von Cancrin, contacted Humboldt about whether a platinum-based currency was possible in Russia and invited him to visit the Ural Mountains. Humboldt was not encouraging about a platinum-based currency, when silver was the standard as a world currency. But the invitation to visit the Urals was intriguing, especially since Humboldt had long dreamed of going to Asia. He had wanted to travel to India and made considerable efforts to persuade the British East India Company to authorize a trip, but those efforts were fruitless.

When Russia renewed its earlier invitation to Humboldt, he accepted. The Russians sought to entice Humboldt by engaging his enduring interest in mining sites, for comparative scientific purposes for Humboldt, but for the Russians to gain expert knowledge about their resources. For Humboldt, the Russian monarch&#x27;s promise to fund the trip was extremely important, since Humboldt&#x27;s inherited 100,000 thaler fortune was gone and he lived on the Prussian government pension of 2,500–3,000 thalers as the monarch&#x27;s chamberlain. The Russian government gave an advance of 1200 in Berlin and another 20,000 when he arrived in Saint Petersburg.

Humboldt was eager to travel not just to the Urals, but also across the steppes of Siberia to Russia&#x27;s border with China. Humboldt wrote Cancrin saying that he intended to learn Russian to read mining journals in the language. As the details of the expedition were worked out, Humboldt said that he would travel to Russia in his own French coach, with a German servant, as well as Gustav Rose, a professor of chemistry and mineralogy. He also invited Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg to join the expedition, to study water micro-organisms in Lake Baikal and the Caspian Sea. Humboldt himself was keen to continue his studies of magnetism of mountains and mineral deposits. As was usual for his research, he brought scientific instruments to take the most accurate measurements. The Russians organized the local arrangements, including lodging, horses, accompanying crew. Humboldt&#x27;s title for the expedition was as an official of the Department of Mines. As the expedition neared dangerous areas, he had to travel in a convoy with an escort.

Physically Humboldt was in good condition, despite his advancing years, writing to Cancrin &quot;I still walk very lightly on foot, nine to ten hours without resting, despite my age and my white hair&quot;.
Between May and November 1829 he and the growing expedition traversed the wide expanse of the Russian empire from the Neva to the Yenisei, accomplishing in twenty-five weeks a distance of . Humboldt and the expedition party travelled by coach on well maintained roads, with rapid progress being made because of changes of horses at way stations. The party had grown, with Johann Seifert, who was a huntsman and collector of animal specimens; a Russian mining official; Count Adolphe Polier, one of Humboldt&#x27;s friends from Paris; a cook; plus a contingent of Cossacks for security. Three carriages were filled with people, supplies, and scientific instruments. For Humboldt&#x27;s magnetic readings to be accurate, they carried an iron-free tent. This expedition was unlike his Spanish American travels with Bonpland, with the two alone and sometimes accompanied by local guides.
The Russian government was interested in Humboldt&#x27;s finding prospects for mining and commercial advancement of the realm and made it clear that Humboldt was not to investigate social issues, nor criticize social conditions of Russian serfs. In his publications on Spanish America, he did comment on the conditions of the indigenous populations, and deplored black slavery, but well after he had left those territories. As Humboldt discovered, the government kept tight control of the expedition, even when it was from Moscow, with local government officials greeting the expedition at every stop. The itinerary was planned with Tobolsk the farthest destination, then a return to Saint Petersburg.

Humboldt wrote to the Russian Minister Cancrin that he was extending his travel, knowing that the missive would not reach him in time to scuttle the plan. The further east he journeyed into wilder territory, the more Humboldt enjoyed it. They still followed the Siberian Highway and made excellent progress, sometimes a hundred miles (160 km) in a day. Although they were halted at the end of July and warned of an anthrax outbreak, Humboldt decided to continue despite the danger. &quot;At my age, nothing should be postponed&quot;.

The journey though carried out with all the advantages afforded by the immediate patronage of the Russian government, was too rapid to be profitable scientifically. The correction of the prevalent exaggerated estimate of the height of the Central Asian plateau, and the prediction of the discovery of diamonds in the gold-washings of the Urals, were important aspects of these travels. In the end, the expedition took 8 months, travelled 15,500 km, stopped at 658 post stations, and used 12,244 horses.

One writer claims that &quot;Nothing was quite as Humboldt wanted it. The entire expedition was a compromise.&quot; The Russian emperor offered Humboldt an invitation to return to Russia, but Humboldt declined, due to his disapproval of Nicholas&#x27;s restrictions on his freedom of movement during the expedition and his ability to freely report on it. Humboldt published two works on the Russian expedition, first in 1831, based on lectures he gave on the topic. In 1843, he completed the three-volume &quot;Asie Centrale&quot;, which he dedicated to Tsar Nicholas, which he called &quot;an unavoidable step, as the expedition was accomplished at his expense&quot;. As of 2016, these works have not been translated to English. His 1829 expedition to Russia when he was an old man is much less known than his five-year travels in Spanish America, which had resulted in many published volumes over the decades since his 1804 return. Nevertheless, it gave Humboldt comparative data for his various later scientific publications.

==Works==
===&quot;Cosmos&quot;===

&quot;Kosmos&quot; was Humboldt&#x27;s multi-volume effort in his later years to write a work bringing together all the research from his long career. The writing took shape in lectures he delivered before the University of Berlin in the winter of 1827–28. These lectures would form &quot;the cartoon for the great fresco of the &quot;[K]osmos&quot;&quot;. His 1829 expedition to Russia supplied him with data comparative to his Latin American expedition.

The first two volumes of the &quot;Kosmos&quot; were published between the years 1845 and 1847 and were intended to comprise the entire work, but Humboldt published three more volumes, one of which was posthumous. Humboldt had long aimed to write a comprehensive work about geography and the natural sciences. The work attempted to unify the sciences then known in a Kantian framework. With inspiration from German Romanticism, Humboldt sought to create a compendium of the world&#x27;s environment. He spent the last decade of his long life—as he called them, his &quot;improbable&quot; years—continuing this work. The third and fourth volumes were published in 1850–58; a fragment of a fifth appeared posthumously in 1862.

His reputation had long since been made with his publications on the Spanish American expedition. There is not a consensus on the importance of &quot;Kosmos&quot;. One scholar, who stresses the importance of Humboldt&#x27;s &quot;Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain&quot; as essential reading, dismisses &quot;Kosmos&quot; as &quot;little more than an academic curiosity&quot;. A different opinion is that &quot;Kosmos&quot; was his &quot;most influential book&quot;.

As with most of Humboldt&#x27;s works, &quot;Kosmos&quot; was also translated into multiple languages in editions of uneven quality. It was very popular in Britain and America. In 1849 a German newspaper commented that in England two of the three different translations were made by women, &quot;while in Germany most of the men do not understand it&quot;. The first translation by Augustin Pritchard—published anonymously by Mr. Baillière (volume I in 1845 and volume II in 1848)—suffered from being hurriedly made. In a letter Humboldt said of it: &quot;It will damage my reputation. All the charm of my description is destroyed by an English sounding like Sanskrit.&quot;

The other two translations were made by Elizabeth Juliana Leeves Sabine under the superintendence of her husband Col. Edward Sabine (4 volumes 1846–1858), and by Elise Otté (5 volumes 1849–1858, the only complete translation of the 4 German volumes). These three translations were also published in the United States. The numbering of the volumes differs between the German and the English editions. Volume 3 of the German edition corresponds to the volumes 3 and 4 of the English translation, as the German volume appeared in 2 parts in 1850 and 1851. Volume 5 of the German edition was not translated until 1981, again by a woman. Otté&#x27;s translation benefited from a detailed table of contents, and an index for every volume; of the German edition only volumes 4 and 5 had (extremely short) tables of contents, and the index to the whole work only appeared with volume 5 in 1862. Less well known in Germany is the atlas belonging to the German edition of the Cosmos &quot;Berghaus&#x27; Physikalischer Atlas&quot;, better known as the pirated version by Traugott Bromme under the title &quot;Atlas zu Alexander von Humboldt&#x27;s Kosmos&quot; (Stuttgart 1861).

In Britain, Heinrich Berghaus planned to publish together with Alexander Keith Johnston a &quot;Physical Atlas&quot;. But later Johnston published it alone under the title &quot;The Physical Atlas of Natural Phenomena&quot;. In Britain its connection to the &quot;Cosmos&quot; seems not have been recognized.

===Other publications===

Alexander von Humboldt published prolifically throughout his life. Many works were published originally in French or German, then translated to other languages, sometimes with competing translation editions. Humboldt himself did not keep track of all the various editions. He wrote specialized works on particular topics of botany, zoology, astronomy, mineralogy, among others, but he also wrote general works that attracted a wide readership, especially his &quot;Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent during the years 1799–1804&quot;. His &quot;Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain&quot; was widely read in Mexico itself, the United States, as well as in Europe.

Many of the original works have been digitally scanned by the Biodiversity Library. There have been new editions of print works, including his &quot;Views of the Cordilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas&quot; (2014), which includes reproductions of all the color and black and white plates. In the original edition, the publication was in a large format and quite expensive. There is a 2009 translation of his &quot;Geography of Plants&quot; and a 2014 English edition of &quot;Views of Nature&quot;.

==Influence on scientists and artists==

Humboldt was generous toward his friends and mentored young scientists. He and Bonpland parted ways after their return to Europe, and Humboldt largely took on the task of publishing the results of their Latin American expedition at Humboldt&#x27;s expense, but he included Bonpland as co-author on the nearly 30 published volumes. Bonpland returned to Latin America, settling in Buenos Aires, Argentina, then moved to the countryside near the border with Paraguay. The forces of Dr. José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, the strong man of Paraguay, abducted Bonpland after killing Bonpland&#x27;s estate workers. Bonpland was accused of &quot;agricultural espionage&quot; and of threatening Paraguay&#x27;s virtual monopoly on the cultivation of yerba mate.

Despite international pressure, including the British government and Simón Bolívar&#x27;s, along with European scientists including Humboldt, Francia kept Bonpland prisoner until 1831. He was released after nearly 10 years in Paraguay. Humboldt and Bonpland maintained a warm correspondence about science and politics until Bonpland&#x27;s death in 1858.

During Humboldt&#x27;s time in Paris, he met in 1818 the young and brilliant Peruvian student of the Royal Mining School of Paris, Mariano Eduardo de Rivero y Ustariz. Subsequently, Humboldt acted as a mentor of the career of this promising Peruvian scientist. Another recipient of Humboldt&#x27;s aid was Louis Agassiz (1807–1873), who was directly aided with needed cash from Humboldt, assistance in securing an academic position, and help with getting his research on zoology published. Agassiz sent him copies of his publications and went on to gain considerable scientific recognition as a professor at Harvard. Agassiz delivered an address to the Boston Society of Natural History in 1869, on the centenary of his patron&#x27;s birth. When Humboldt was an elderly man, he aided another young scholar, Gotthold Eisenstein, a brilliant, young, Jewish mathematician in Berlin, for whom he obtained a small crown pension and whom he nominated for the Academy of Science.

Humboldt&#x27;s popular writings inspired many scientists and naturalists, including Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, Ida Laura Pfeiffer as well as brothers Richard and Robert Schomburgk and Robert, Adolf, and Hermann Schlagintweit.

Humboldt carried on correspondence with many contemporaries and two volumes of letters to Karl August Varnhagen von Ense have been published.

Charles Darwin made frequent reference to Humboldt&#x27;s work in his &quot;Voyage of the Beagle&quot;, where Darwin described his own scientific exploration of the Americas. In one note, he placed Humboldt first on the &quot;list of American travellers&quot;. Darwin&#x27;s work was influenced by Humboldt&#x27;s writing style as well. Darwin&#x27;s sister remarked to him &quot;you had, probably from reading so much of Humboldt, got his phraseology and the kind of flowery French expressions he uses&quot;.

When Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; was published, he sent a copy to Humboldt, who responded, &quot;You told me in your kind letter that, when you were young, the manner in which I studied and depicted nature in the torrid zones contributed toward exciting in you the ardour and desire to travel in distant lands. Considering the importance of your work, Sir, this may be the greatest success that my humble work could bring.&quot; In his autobiography, Darwin recalled, reading &quot;with care and profound interest Humboldt&#x27;s &quot;Personal Narrative&quot; and finding it one of the two most influential books on his work, which stirred in him &quot;a burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble structure of Natural Science&quot;.

Humboldt would later reveal to Darwin in the 1840s that he had been deeply interested in Darwin&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s poetry. Erasmus Darwin had published the poem &quot;The Loves of the Plants&quot; in the early 1800s. Humboldt praised the poem for combining nature and imagination, a theme that permeated Humboldt&#x27;s own work.
A number of nineteenth-century artists travelled to Latin America, following in the footsteps of Humboldt, painting landscapes and scenes of everyday life. Johann Moritz Rugendas, Ferdinand Bellermann, and Eduard Hildebrandt were three important European painters. Frederic Edwin Church was the most famous landscape painter in the U.S. in the nineteenth century. His paintings of Andean volcanoes that Humboldt climbed helped make Church&#x27;s reputation. His 5 foot by 10 foot painting entitled &quot;The Heart of the Andes&quot; &quot;caused a sensation&quot; when it was completed. Church had hoped to ship the painting to Berlin to show the painting to Humboldt, but Humboldt died a few days after Church&#x27;s letter was written. Church painted Cotopaxi three times, twice in 1855 and then in 1859 in eruption.

George Catlin, most famous for his portraits of North American Indians and paintings of life among various North American tribes, also travelled to South America, producing a number of paintings. He wrote to Humboldt in 1855, sending him his proposal for South American travels. Humboldt replied, thanking him and sending a memorandum helping guide his travels.

Ida Laura Pfeiffer, one of the first female travelers who completed two trips around the world from 1846 to 1855, followed in Humboldt&#x27;s footsteps. The two explorers met in Berlin in 1851 before Pfeiffer&#x27;s second tour and again in 1855 when she returned to Europe. Humboldt provided Pfeiffer with an open letter of introduction in which he bade anyone who knew of his name to assist Madame Pfeiffer for her &quot;inextinguishable energy of character which she has everywhere shown, to wheresoever&#x27;s she has been called or better put, driven by her unconquerable passion to study nature and man.&quot;

==Other aspects of Humboldt&#x27;s life and career==

===Humboldt and the Prussian monarchy===
In the Napoleonic wars, Prussia had capitulated to France, signing the Treaty of Tilsit. The Prussian royal family returned to Berlin, but sought better terms of the treaty and Friedrich Wilhelm III commissioned his younger brother Prince Wilhelm with this. Friedrich Wilhelm III asked Alexander to be part of the mission, charged with introducing the prince to Paris society. This turn of events for Humboldt could not have been better, since he desired to live in Paris rather than Berlin.

In 1814 Humboldt accompanied the allied sovereigns to London. Three years later he was summoned by the king of Prussia to attend him at the congress of Aachen. Again in the autumn of 1822 he accompanied the same monarch to the Congress of Verona, proceeded thence with the royal party to Rome and Naples and returned to Paris in the spring of 1823. Humboldt had long regarded Paris as his true home. Thus, when at last he received from his sovereign a summons to join his court at Berlin, he obeyed reluctantly.

Between 1830 and 1848 Humboldt was frequently employed in diplomatic missions to the court of King Louis Philippe of France, with whom he always maintained the most cordial personal relations. Charles X of France had been overthrown, with Louis-Philippe of the house of Orléans becoming king. Humboldt knew the family, and he was sent by the Prussian monarch to Paris to report on events to his monarch. He spent three years in France, from 1830 to 1833. His friends François Arago and François Guizot, were appointed to posts in Louis-Philippe&#x27;s government.

Humboldt&#x27;s brother, Wilhelm, died on 8 April 1835. Alexander lamented that he had lost half of himself with the death of his brother. Upon the accession of the crown prince Frederick William IV in June 1840, Humboldt&#x27;s favor at court increased. Indeed, the new king&#x27;s craving for Humboldt&#x27;s company became at times so importunate as to leave him only a few waking hours to work on his writing.

=== Representation of indigenous population ===
Humboldt&#x27;s publications such as &quot;Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent during the years 1799–1804&quot; originate from a time when colonialism was prevalent. Within recent academic publications, there are arguments for and against Humboldt&#x27;s own imperial bias. Within the book &quot;Imperial Eyes&quot;, Pratt argues for an implicit imperial bias within Humboldt&#x27;s writing. While Humboldt financed his expedition to the Spanish colonies independently, the Spanish monarchy allowed him to travel to South America. Due to unrest within the Spanish colonies in South America, the Spanish crown implemented liberal reforms which led to greater support of the Spanish monarchy within the lower class. However, Pratt points out that the reforms created opposition towards the Spanish rule within the upper class as the declining control of the Spanish monarchy would result in the white South American elite losing their privileges. When Humboldt wrote about the natural world within South America, he portrayed it as neutral and free of people: If the indigenous population was mentioned within Humboldt&#x27;s writing, Pratt argues, they were only represented when they were beneficial for Europeans. Others argue that Humboldt was a German Columbus, as he described a virginal country that could be used for commerce by Europeans.

Other scholars counter Pratt&#x27;s argumentation and refer to the abolitionist and anti-colonialist standpoint that Humboldt represents within his writing. An example is Humboldt&#x27;s descriptions of the South American colonies in which he critiqued Spanish colonial rule. His close relationship with Enlightenment values such as liberty and freedom led to his support of democracy and his subsequent support of the independence of South America. In order to improve the material and political situation of the indigenous population, Humboldt included propositions within his writing that he also presented to the Spanish monarchy. When witnessing a slave market, Humboldt was shocked by the treatment of black people which led him to become opposed to slavery and support the abolitionist movement throughout his life. Within his descriptions in &quot;Personal Narratives&quot;, Humboldt also included the answers that were given to him by indigenous people. Additionally, Lubrich argues that despite the colonial and orientalist notions of his writing, Humboldt did not recreate these stereotypes, but deconstructed them.

===Religion===

Because Humboldt did not mention God in his work &quot;Cosmos&quot;, and sometimes spoke unfavourably of religious attitudes, it was occasionally speculated that he was a materialist philosopher, or perhaps an atheist. However, unlike irreligious figures such as Robert G. Ingersoll, who went so far as to use Humboldtian science to campaign against religion, Humboldt himself denied imputations of atheism. In a letter to Varnhagen von Ense he emphasized that he believed the world had indeed been created, writing of &quot;Cosmos&quot;: &quot;...&#x27;creation&#x27; and the &#x27;created world&#x27; are never lost sight of in the book. And did I not, only eight months ago, in the French translation, say, in the plainest terms: &#x27;It is this necessity of things, this occult but permanent connection, this periodical return in the progress, development of formation, phenomena, and events which constitute &#x27;Nature&#x27; submissive to a controlling power?&#x27;&quot;

It has been argued that &quot;although Humboldt emphasizes the basis of morality in the nature of man, he does acknowledge that a belief in God is linked directly to acts of virtue&quot; and therefore &quot;the dignity of man lies at the centre of Humboldt&#x27;s religious thought&quot;.

Humboldt also believed firmly in an afterlife. A letter he wrote to his friend Charlotte Hildebrand Diede states: &quot;God constantly appoints the course of nature and of circumstances; so that, including his existence in an eternal future, the happiness of the individual does not perish, but on the contrary grows and increases.&quot;

Humboldt remained distant of organized religion, typical of a Protestant in Germany relating to the Catholic Church; Humboldt held deep respect for the ideal side of religious belief and church life within human communities. He differentiated between &quot;negative&quot; religions, and those &quot;all positive religions [which] consist of three distinct parts—a code of morals which is nearly the same in all of them, and generally very pure; a geological chimera, and a myth or a little historical novel&quot;. In &quot;Cosmos&quot;, he wrote about how rich geological descriptions were found in different religious traditions, and stated: &quot;Christianity gradually diffused itself, and, wherever it was adopted as the religion of the state, it not only exercised a beneficial condition on the lower classes by inculcating the social freedom of mankind, but also expanded the views of men in their communion with Nature...this tendency to glorify the Deity in his works gave rise to a taste for natural observation.&quot;

Humboldt showed religious tolerance towards Judaism, and he criticized the political &quot;Jews Bill&quot;, which was an initiative intended to establish legal discrimination against Jews. He called this an &quot;abominable&quot; law, since he hoped to see Jews being treated equally in society.

===Sociality===
Much of Humboldt&#x27;s private life remains a mystery because he destroyed his private letters. While a gregarious personality, he may have harbored a sense of social alienation, which drove his passion for escape through travel.

===Sexuality===

Humboldt never married: while he was friendly with a number of women, including Henriette, the wife of his mentor Marcus Herz, his sister-in-law Caroline von Humboldt stated &quot;nothing will ever have a great influence on Alexander that doesn&#x27;t come through men&quot;. He had many strong male friendships, and at times had romances with men.

As a student he became infatuated with Wilhelm Gabriel Wegener, a theology student, penning a succession of letters expressing his &quot;fervent love&quot;. At 25 he met Reinhardt von Haeften (1772–1803), a 22-year-old lieutenant, with whom he lived and travelled for two years, and to whom he wrote in 1794: &quot;I only live through you, my good precious Reinhardt&quot;. When von Haeften became engaged, Humboldt begged to remain living with him and his wife: &quot;Even if you must refuse me, treat me coldly with disdain, I should still want to be with you... the love I have for you is not just friendship or brotherly love, it is veneration&quot;.

A traveling companion in the Americas for five years was Aimé Bonpland, and in Quito in 1802 he met the Ecuadorian aristocrat Don Carlos Montúfar, who travelled with Humboldt to Europe and lived with him. In France, Humboldt travelled and lived with the physicist and balloonist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac. Later he had a deep friendship with the married French astronomer François Arago, whom he met daily for 15 years.

Humboldt once wrote &quot;I don&#x27;t know sensual needs&quot;. However, a pious travelling companion, Francisco José de Caldas, accused him of frequenting houses in Quito where &quot;impure love reigned&quot;, of making friends with &quot;obscene dissolute youths&quot;, of giving vent to &quot;shameful passions of his heart&quot;, and dropping him to travel with &quot;Bonpland and his Adonis&quot; [Montúfar].

Humboldt inherited a significant fortune, but the expense of his travels, and most especially of publishing (thirty volumes in all), had by 1834 made him totally reliant on the pension of King Frederick William III. Although he preferred living in Paris, by 1836 the King had insisted he return to Germany. He lived with the Court at Sanssouci, and latterly in Berlin, with his valet Seifert, who had accompanied him to Russia in 1829.

Four years before his death, Humboldt executed a deed of gift transferring his entire estate to Seifert, who had by then married and set up a household near Humboldt&#x27;s apartment. Humboldt had become godfather to his daughter. The scale of the bequest has always drawn speculation, especially as Seifert was some thirty years younger, and introducing lower class partners into households under the guise of servants was then a common practice.

In 1908, the sexual researcher Paul Näcke gathered reminiscences from homosexuals including Humboldt&#x27;s friend the botanist Carl Bolle, then nearly 90 years old: some of the material was incorporated by Magnus Hirschfeld into his 1914 study &quot;Homosexuality in Men and Women&quot;. However, speculations about Humboldt&#x27;s private life and possible homosexuality continue to remain a fractious issue amongst scholars, particularly as earlier biographers had portrayed him as &quot;a largely asexual, Christ-like Humboldt figure...suitable as a national idol&quot;.

===Illness and death===
On 24 February 1857, Humboldt suffered a minor stroke, which passed without perceptible symptoms. It was not until the winter of 1858–1859 that his strength began to decline; on 6 May 1859, he died peacefully in Berlin, aged 89. His last words were reported to be &quot;How glorious these sunbeams are! They seem to call Earth to the Heavens!&quot; His remains were conveyed in state through the streets of Berlin, in a hearse drawn by six horses. Royal chamberlains led the cortège, each charged with carrying a pillow with Humboldt&#x27;s medals and other decorations of honor. Humboldt&#x27;s extended family, descendants of his brother Wilhelm, walked in the procession. Humboldt&#x27;s coffin was received by the prince-regent at the door of the cathedral. He was interred at the family resting-place at Tegel, alongside his brother Wilhelm and sister-in-law Caroline.

==Honours and namesakes==
The honours which had been showered on Humboldt during life continued after his death. More species are named after Humboldt than after any other human being. The first centenary of Humboldt&#x27;s birth was celebrated on 14 September 1869, with great enthusiasm in both the New and Old Worlds. Numerous monuments were constructed in his honour, such as Humboldt Park in Chicago, planned that year and constructed shortly after the Chicago fire. Newly explored regions and species named after Humboldt, as discussed below, also stand as a measure of his wide fame and popularity.

&quot;Scarcely was there a European order which Humboldt had not the right to wear&quot;, and &quot;more than a hundred and fifty societies to which he had been elected&quot;. These included &quot;the most celebrated Academies of the leading nations of Europe and America, and not merely those of a purely scientific character, but any which had for their object the spread of education and the advancement of civilisation.&quot; Additionally, he was at least an honorary member of academies and learned societies throughout Europe and America and &quot;was invested with the degree of Doctor in three faculties&quot;.

===Lecture series===
Alexander von Humboldt also lends his name to a prominent lecture series in Human geography in the Netherlands (hosted by the Radboud University Nijmegen). It is the Dutch equivalent of the widely known annual Hettner lectures at the University of Heidelberg.

===The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation===
After his death, Humboldt&#x27;s friends and colleagues created the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (&quot;Stiftung&quot; in German) to continue his generous support of young academics. Although the original endowment was lost in the German hyperinflation of the 1920s, and again as a result of World War II, the Foundation has been re-endowed by the German government to award young academics and distinguished senior academics from abroad. It plays an important role in attracting foreign researchers to work in Germany and enabling German researchers to work abroad for a period.

===Dedications===
Edgar Allan Poe dedicated his last major work, &quot;&quot;, to Humboldt, &quot;With Very Profound Respect&quot;. Humboldt&#x27;s attempt to unify the sciences in his &quot;Kosmos&quot; was a major inspiration for Poe&#x27;s project.

In 2019, Josefina Benedetti composed &quot;Humboldt&quot; an Orchestral Suite in five movements.

===Ships===
&quot;Alexander von Humboldt&quot; is also a German ship named after the scientist, originally built in 1906 by the German shipyard AG Weser at Bremen as Reserve Sonderburg. She was operated throughout the North and Baltic Seas until being retired in 1986. Subsequently, she was converted into a three-masted barque by the German shipyard Motorwerke Bremerhaven, and was re-launched in 1988 as &quot;Alexander von Humboldt&quot;.

The Jan De Nul Group operates a hopper dredger built in 1998 also named &quot;Alexander von Humboldt&quot;.

===Recognitions by contemporaries===

Simón Bolívar wrote that &quot;The real discoverer of South America was Humboldt, since his work was more useful for our people than the work of all conquerors&quot;. Charles Darwin expressed his debt to Humboldt, and admiration for his work, writing to Joseph Dalton Hooker that Humboldt was the &quot;greatest scientific traveller who ever lived&quot;. Wilhelm von Humboldt wrote that &quot;Alexander is destined to combine ideas and follow chains of thoughts which would otherwise have remained unknown for ages. His depth, his sharp mind and his incredible speed are a rare combination.&quot; Johann Wolfgang Goethe observed that &quot;Humboldt showers us with true treasures&quot;. Friedrich Schiller wrote that &quot;Alexander impresses many, particularly when compared to his brother—because he shows off more!&quot; José de la Luz y Caballero wrote that &quot;Columbus gave Europe a New World; Humboldt made it known in its physical, material, intellectual, and moral aspects&quot;.

Napoléon Bonaparte remarked &quot;You have been studying Botanics? Just like my wife!&quot; Claude Louis Berthollet said &quot;This man is as knowledgeable as a whole academy&quot;. Thomas Jefferson remarked &quot;I consider him the most important scientist whom I have met&quot;. Emil du Bois-Reymond wrote that &quot;Every assiduous scholar ... is Humboldt&#x27;s son; we are all his family.&quot; Robert G. Ingersoll wrote that &quot;He was to science what Shakespeare was to the drama&quot;.

Hermann von Helmholtz wrote that &quot;During the first half of the present century we had an Alexander von Humboldt, who was able to scan the scientific knowledge of his time in its details, and to bring it within one vast generalization. At the present juncture, it is obviously very doubtful whether this task could be accomplished in a similar way, even by a mind with gifts so peculiarly suited for the purpose as Humboldt&#x27;s was, and if all his time and work were devoted to the purpose.&quot;

<text>Acritarchs are organic microfossils, known from approximately 1800 million years ago to the present. The classification is a catch all term used to refer to any organic microfossils that cannot be assigned to other groups. Their diversity reflects major ecological events such as the appearance of predation and the Cambrian explosion.

==Definition==
Acritarchs were originally defined as non-acid soluble (i.e. non-carbonate, non-siliceous) organic-walled microfossils consisting of a central cavity, and whose biological affinities cannot be determined with certainty. Most commonly they are composed of thermally altered acid insoluble carbon compounds (kerogen).

Acritarchs may include the remains of a wide range of quite different kinds of organisms—ranging from the egg cases of small metazoans to resting cysts of many kinds of chlorophyta (green algae). It is likely that most acritarch species from the Paleozoic represent various stages of the life cycle of algae that were ancestral to the dinoflagellates. The nature of the organisms associated with Precambrian acritarchs is generally not well understood, though many are probably related to unicellular marine algae. In theory, when the biological source (taxon) of an acritarch does become known, that particular microfossil is removed from the acritarchs and classified with its proper group.

While the classification of acritarchs into form genera is entirely artificial, it is not without merit, as the form taxa show traits similar to those of genuine taxa—for example an &#x27;explosion&#x27; in the Cambrian and a mass extinction at the end of the Permian.

==Classification==

The informal group, Acritarcha Evitt 1963, was originally divided into the Subgroups: Acanthomorphitae, Polygonomorphitae, Prismatomorphitae, Oömorphitae, Netromorphitae, Dinetromorphitae, Stephanomorphitae, Pteromorphitae, Herkomorphitae, Platymorphitae, Sphaeromorphitae, and Disphaeromorphitae.

Acritarchs were most likely eukaryotes. While archaea and bacteria (prokaryotes) usually produce simple fossils of a very small size, eukaryotic unicellular fossils are usually larger and more complex, with external morphological projections and ornamentation such as spines and hairs that only eukaryotes can produce; as most acritarchs have external projections (e.g., hair, spines, thick cell membranes, etc.), they are predominantly eukaryotes, although simple eukaryote acritarchs also exist.

The recent application of atomic force microscopy, confocal microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and other sophisticated analytic techniques to the study of the ultrastructure, life history, and systematic affinities of mineralized, but originally organic-walled microfossils, has shown that some acritarchs are actually fossilized microalgae. In the end, it may well be, as Moczydłowska et al. suggested in 2011, that many acritarchs will, in fact, turn out to be algae.

==Occurrence==

Acritarchs are found in sedimentary rocks from the present back into the Archean. They are typically isolated from siliciclastic sedimentary rocks using hydrofluoric acid but are occasionally extracted from carbonate-rich rocks. They are excellent candidates for index fossils used for dating rock formations in the Paleozoic Era and when other fossils are not available. Because most acritarchs are thought to be marine (pre-Triassic), they are also useful for palaeoenvironmental interpretation.

The Archean and earliest Proterozoic microfossils termed &quot;acritarchs&quot; may actually be prokaryotes. The earliest eukaryotic acritarchs known () are from between 1950 and 2150 million years ago.

==Diversity==

At about 1 billion years ago the organisms responsible for acritarchs started to increase in abundance, diversity, size, complexity of shape, and especially, the size and number of spines. Their populations crashed during periods of extensive worldwide glaciations that covered the majority of the planet, but they proliferated in the Cambrian explosion and reached their highest diversity in the Paleozoic. The increased spininess 1000 million years ago possibly resulted from the need for defense against predators, especially predators large enough to swallow them or tear them apart. Other groups of small organisms from the Neoproterozoic era also show signs of anti-predator defenses.

Further evidence that acritarchs were subject to herbivory around this time comes from a consideration of taxon longevity. The abundance of planktonic organisms that evolved between 1,700 and 1,400 million years ago was limited by nutrient availability – a situation which limits the origination of new species because the existing organisms are so specialised to their niches, and no other niches are available for occupation. Approximately 1,000 million years ago, species longevity fell sharply, suggesting that predation pressure, probably by protist herbivores, became an important factor. Predation would have kept populations in check, meaning that some nutrients were left unused, and new niches were available for new species to occupy.

==Etymology==
&quot;Acritarch&quot; was coined in 1963 from the Greek &quot;ákritos&quot; meaning &quot;confused&quot; (&quot;a kritēs&quot;, &quot;without critic&quot;) and &quot;archē&quot; meaning &quot;origin&quot; (confer ).

<text>William Michael Joseph Whelan (born 22 May 1950) is an Irish composer and musician. He is best known for composing a piece for the interval of the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest. The result, &quot;Riverdance&quot;, was a seven-minute piece of original music accompanying a new take on traditional Irish stepdance that became a full-length stage production and spawned a worldwide craze for Irish traditional music and dance. The corresponding soundtrack album earned him a Grammy. &quot;Riverdance&quot; was released as a single in 1994, credited to &quot;Bill Whelan and Anúna featuring the RTÉ Concert Orchestra&quot;. It reached number one in Ireland for 18 weeks and number nine in the UK. The album of the same title reached number 31 in the album charts in 1995.

Whelan has also arranged a symphonic suite version of &quot;Riverdance&quot;, with its premiere performed by the Ulster Orchestra on BBC Radio 3 in August 2014.

A studio recording was released on CD (on the RTÉ lyric fm label) in 2018.

==Biography==
Whelan is a native of Limerick city, and was educated at Crescent College. He gained his Bachelor of Civil Law degree at University College Dublin in 1973 and then went to King&#x27;s Inns. In 2011, Whelan was awarded the UCD Foundation Day Medal in recognition of his outstanding achievements and his contribution to Irish music worldwide. While he is best known for his &quot;Riverdance&quot; composition and the theatrical show of the same name, Whelan has been involved in many ground-breaking projects in Ireland since the 1970s. In his autobiography, he especially mentions the major influence of James W. Flannery.

As a producer he has worked with U2 (on their &quot;War&quot; album), Van Morrison, Kate Bush, The Dubliners, Planxty, Andy Irvine &amp; Davy Spillane, Patrick Street, Stockton&#x27;s Wing and fellow Limerickman Richard Harris.

* &quot;The Seville Suite&quot; (1992), which was inspired by the exploits of Aodh Rua Ó Dónaill from The Battle of Kinsale in 1601 until his arrival in Galicia to the welcome of The Spanish Earl of Caraçena. In addition to the orchestra, &quot;The Seville Suite&quot; includes Celtic Music on Uilleann Pipes, accordion, bodhrán, fiddle as well as Galician harp, whistles and pipes. 
* &quot;The Spirit of Mayo&quot; (1993) in honour of Mayo 5000. Performed by an 85-piece orchestra in Dublin&#x27;s National Concert Hall and featuring a powerful Celtic drum corps and a 200 strong choir and choral group Anúna.

In theatre, Whelan received a Laurence Olivier Award nomination for his adaption of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. His film credits include, &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; (starring Meryl Streep), &quot;Some Mother&#x27;s Son&quot;, &quot;Lamb&quot; (starring Liam Neeson) and the award-winning &quot;At The Cinema Palace&quot;.

<text>Elizabeth Cavendish, later Elizabeth Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury ( Hardwick; 13 February 1608), known as Bess of Hardwick, of Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire, was a notable figure of Elizabethan English society. By a series of well-made marriages, she rose to the highest levels of English nobility and became enormously wealthy. Bess was reportedly a shrewd businesswoman, increasing her assets with business interests including mines and glass-making workshops.

She was married four times. Her first husband was Robert Barley (or Barlow), who died aged about 14 or 15 on 24 December 1544. Her second husband was the courtier Sir William Cavendish. Her third husband was Sir William St Loe. Her last husband was George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, sometime keeper to the captive Mary, Queen of Scots. An accomplished needlewoman, Bess joined her husband&#x27;s captive charge at Chatsworth House for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the Oxburgh Hangings.

In 1601, Bess ordered an inventory of the household furnishings, including textiles, at her three properties at Chatsworth, Hardwick, and Chelsea, which survives. In her will she bequeathed these items to her heirs to be preserved in perpetuity. The 400-year-old collection, now known as the Hardwick Hall textiles, is the largest collection of tapestry, embroidery, canvaswork, and other textiles to have been preserved by a single private family. Bess is also well known for her building projects, the most famous of which are Chatsworth, now the seat of the Dukes of Devonshire (whose family name is Cavendish as they descend from the children of her second marriage), and Hardwick Hall.

==Origins==
Elizabeth Hardwick was the daughter of John Hardwick of Derbyshire by his wife Elizabeth Leeke, daughter of Thomas Leeke and Margaret Fox. Her exact birthdate is unknown, occurring in the period 1521 to 1527; that said, according to her witness statement under oath at a court hearing in October 1546, in which she gives her age at the time of her first marriage in May 1543 as being &quot;of tender years&quot;, i.e. less than 16, would indicate 1527. It cannot be later than 1527 because of the date of her father&#x27;s death, given in his Inquisition Post Mortem.

The Hardwicks had arrived in Derbyshire from Sussex by the mid-thirteenth century, and farmed land granted by Robert Savage, lord of the manor of Stainsby, on the north-east border of Derbyshire, looking over Nottinghamshire. By the mid-fifteenth century the family had risen to &quot;gentleman-yeoman&quot; stock, with an estate of a few hundred acres located mainly in the parish of Ault Hucknall in the manor of Stainsby. The Hardwick coat of arms of Hardwick was probably granted c. 1450 to William Hardwick. The blazon is: &quot;Argent, a saltier engrailed azure on a chief of the second three cinquefoils of the first&quot;. When giving evidence of his right to arms in 1569, Bess&#x27;s only brother, James Hardwick (1525-1580/1), provided the heralds with a pedigree of his family which began with this William, who died .

James was the last surviving legitimate male member of the Hardwick family. The Hardwicks were members of the minor gentry of Scarsdale; no male member of the Hardwick family rose above the status of esquire or held any important local or county offices. Bess was born into this relatively minor gentry family. Her fourth marriage to the earl of Shrewsbury in 1567 elevated her to the rank of &quot;countess&quot;, and following the earl&#x27;s death in November 1590, Bess became one of the richest women in the kingdom. She set about building her greatest monument, Hardwick New Hall, which was completed in 1599.

==Early life==
John Hardwick died aged about 40 leaving a widow, son (and heir), and four daughters (five daughters were alive at the time he wrote his will). His widow Elizabeth Leeke then married Ralph, the second son of the neighbouring Leche (or Leach) family of Chatsworth, in Derbyshire, by whom she would leave an additional three co-heiresses.

Little is known of Bess&#x27;s early life. She appears to have been espoused to her first husband during the 1530s, and probably married for the first time in 1543. Despite the story being often repeated, there is no contemporary evidence whatsoever to support Dugdale&#x27;s later claims that she became familiar with city life and the Tudor Court after being sent to live, aged twelve, in the London household of Anne Gainsford, Lady Zouche of Codnor Castle in Derbyshire, where she was supposedly influenced by Lady Zouche. Despite a lack of evidence, it is possible – but no more than that – that at some point, perhaps after the death of her first husband, she entered the service of the Zouches at Codnor Castle in Derbyshire.

A close family associate was a man named Henry Marmion whose family held land close to Codnor, and may have commended Bess to the Zouches who, along with the Vernons, were the only major Derbyshire family likely to have taken in such children. However, Anne Gainsford was in service in the households of Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour, and despite marrying Sir George Zouche in 1533, spent much of her time at court until after 1536, when she and Sir George made Codnor Castle their main residence. Not surprisingly, this period coincides with the time that Dugdale claimed Bess was in service to Anne Gainsford in London and at Codnor. However, there is no evidence to support the story, and Dugdale would have known much more about the early life of Lady Zouche than was known of Bess&#x27;s origins. Again, according to Dugdale, from Codnor Bess entered the service of the Greys at Bradgate in Leicestershire, where she met and married her second husband, Sir William Cavendish. She certainly married Sir William at Bradgate, but that in itself does not prove that Bess was in service at Bradgate. It remains possible that she met Sir William elsewhere, possibly at Codnor. More likely, she was recommended to the Greys by Henry Grey&#x27;s sister, Margaret, Lady Willoughby. Henry Marmion was one the Willoughby&#x27;s most trusted upper servants, he was also one of the two men appointed in Bess&#x27;s father&#x27;s will and guardians of his children. (the other was Bess&#x27;s uncle, John Leake).

==Bess&#x27;s four marriages==

===First marriage===
In 1543, Bess married 13-year-old Robert Barley (or Barlow), heir to a neighbouring estate. The exact date of her marriage to Robert is unknown. It is thought that the marriage took place late May 1543, shortly before the death of Robert&#x27;s father on 28 May. There is no evidence that they lived together as husband and wife. Robert died in December 1544. There was no issue from the marriage, which had been arranged locally, probably initially to protect the Barley patrimony and to mitigate the impact of wardship on the Barley estate should Robert succeed his father as an underage heir. The traditional story that Robert and Bess met in London while in the service of a &quot;Lady Zouche&quot; is based on oral history, which can only be dated to the late seventeenth century (some eighty years after Bess&#x27;s death). The marital claims to Robert&#x27;s estate were disputed, and following his death Bess was refused dower by Peter Freschevile. A court battle ensued, which resulted in Bess being awarded her claim on the Barley estate and compensation, albeit several years after Robert&#x27;s death.

===Second marriage===

On 20 August 1547, Bess married the twice-widowed Sir William Cavendish, Treasurer of the King&#x27;s Chamber, and became Lady Cavendish. The wedding took place at two o&#x27;clock in the morning, at the home of the Grey family, friends of the couple. Sir William was more than twice Bess&#x27;s age and the father of two daughters. His fortune had been made following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, since as an official of the Court of Augmentations he was able to select choice properties for himself. Possibly acting on Bess&#x27;s advice, Sir William sold his lands in the south of England and bought the Chatsworth estates in her home county of Derbyshire. Sir William Cavendish died on 25 October 1557, leaving Bess widowed a second time and in deep debt to the Crown. Upon his death, Bess claimed the sum of his property, having insisted that his land be settled on their heirs.
The eight children of the marriage, two of whom died in infancy, were as follows:
* Frances Cavendish (18 June 1548January 1632), the eldest child, married Sir Henry Pierrepont, MP. Their children were:
** Robert Pierrepont, 1st Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull who married Gertrude Talbot. They had five sons including Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester and William Pierrepoint, MP. Robert was also the forebear of the Dukes of Kingston-upon-Hull, extinct since 1773. The Earls Manvers (extinct in 1955) succeeded to the Pierrepont Estates.
** Elizabeth Pierrepont married Sir Thomas Erskine, first Earl of Kellie.
** Grace Pierrepont married Sir George Manners. They had four children, including John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland.
* Temperance Cavendish (10 June 15491550), 2nd child, died in infancy.
* Henry Cavendish (17 December 155028 October 1616), 3rd child, a godson of Queen Elizabeth I. He married Grace Talbot. Henry Cavendish is the forebear of the Barons Waterpark. The title of Baron Waterpark is extant. He hated his wife and had no legitimate children. Instead he had eight illegitimate children, four boys and four girls. After attempting and failing to liberate his niece Arbella Stuart from his mother&#x27;s estate, he was disinherited by his mother. Bess referred to him as &quot;my bad son Henry&quot;.
* William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire (27 December 15523 March 1626), 4th child, forebear of the extant Dukes of Devonshire.
* Charles Cavendish (28 November 15534 April 1617), 5th child, a godson of Queen Mary I of England. He married Catherine Ogle, 8th Baroness Ogle. They had a son:
** William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, forebear of the Dukes of Newcastle, extinct since 1691. The Barony of Ogle is in abeyance, as more than one person has a legal right to claim the title. The estates passed through to the female line to the Dukes of Portland and Newcastle-under-Lyne, both now extinct.
* Elizabeth Cavendish (31 March 155521 January 1582), 6th child, wife of Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox. They had a daughter:
** Lady Arbella Stuart, 2nd Countess of Lennox, married William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset, an extant title. 
* Mary Cavendish (January 1556April 1632), 7th child, wife of Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury. They had five children including:
** Lady Alatheia (or Alethea) Talbot, who married Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Norfolk. The title of Duke of Norfolk is extant.
** Lady Mary Talbot who married William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. The title Earl of Pembroke is extant.
** Lady Elizabeth Talbot married Henry Grey, 8th Earl of Kent. The title Earl of Kent from the Grey family has been extinct since 1740.
* Lucrece Cavendish (born and died 1556), 8th child, probably the twin of Mary.

===Third marriage===

In 1559 Bess married a third time, to Sir William St Loe (1518–1565) (&quot;alias&quot; St Lowe, Saintlowe, Sentloe, etc.) and became Lady St Loe. Her new husband was Captain of the Guard to Queen Elizabeth I and Chief Butler of England. Due to his relationship with Queen Elizabeth I, he was able to reduce the debt Bess owed and paid it back in full on her behalf. He owned large West Country estates at Tormarton in Gloucestershire and Chew Magna in Somerset, while his principal residence was at Sutton Court in Stowey. When he died without male issue in 1564/5, in suspicious circumstances (probably poisoned by his younger brother), he left everything to Bess, to the detriment of his daughters and brother. In addition to her own six surviving children, Bess was now responsible for the two daughters of Sir William St Loe from his first marriage. However, those two daughters were already adults and otherwise well provided for.

Sir William St Loe&#x27;s death left Bess one of the wealthiest women in England. Her annual income was calculated to amount to £60,000, . Further, she was a Lady of the Bedchamber with daily access to the Queen, whose favour she enjoyed. Still in her late 30s, Bess retained her looks and good health, and a number of important men began courting her.

===Fourth marriage===

Despite being courted by several suitors, Bess did not remarry until 1568, when she married for the fourth time to become Countess of Shrewsbury. Her new husband, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, was one of the premier aristocrats of the realm, and the father of seven children by his first marriage. Indeed, two of his children were married to two of hers in a double ceremony in February 1568: Bess&#x27;s daughter Mary Cavendish, aged 12, was given in marriage to Shrewsbury&#x27;s eldest son Gilbert, aged 16; while Bess&#x27;s son, Sir Henry Cavendish, aged 18, married Shrewsbury&#x27;s daughter Lady Grace Talbot, aged 8.

In the year before Bess and the Earl of Shrewsbury were married, a political disturbance arose in Scotland, which would profoundly affect their lives. Rebel Scottish lords rose up against Mary, Queen of Scots, imprisoned her, and forced her to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old infant son, James. In May 1568, Mary escaped captivity in Scotland, and fled south towards England, seeking the protection of her cousin, Queen Elizabeth. However, the English authorities were not sure how to receive her. On 18 May, she was taken into protective custody at Carlisle Castle by local officials.

Queen Elizabeth felt obliged to host and protect Mary, her cousin, against the rebellious Scottish lords. However, due to Mary&#x27;s persistent claim to the English throne, Elizabeth also regarded her as a threat. Elizabeth had Mary moved to Bolton Castle in Yorkshire, where she was lodged under the guard of Francis Knollys, pending the York Conference inquiry, regarding Mary&#x27;s fate. The inquiry results were inconclusive; yet Elizabeth did not set Mary free. Instead, Mary would be detained under the custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury, and his wife Bess. Elizabeth&#x27;s instruction to Bess and her husband amounted to little more than Mary&#x27;s house arrest. Mary reached her new residence, Tutbury Castle, in February 1569, when she was 26 years old, and would remain in the custody of Shrewsbury and Bess for 15 years. Elizabeth shifted the costs of the imprisonment to Shrewsbury. It was recorded that Mary would use the couple&#x27;s insecurities against each other, even convincing Talbot that Bess was stealing. Mary&#x27;s presence in their home, as well as the financial costs and political tensions, may have contributed to the rift between Shrewsbury and Bess, which would lead eventually to the break-up of their marriage.

While in the care of the earl and countess, Queen Mary lived at one or another of their many houses in the Midlands: Tutbury, Wingfield Manor, Chatsworth House, and Sheffield Manor. Throughout this period, Bess spent time as Mary&#x27;s companion, working with her on embroidery and textile projects. Indeed, all Mary&#x27;s work later became part of Bess&#x27;s historical collection at Hardwick Hall.
 Bess joined Mary at Chatsworth for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the Oxburgh Hangings. Bess sent Elizabeth I a remarkable dress as a New Year&#x27;s Day gift for 1577, according to Elizabeth Wingfield, who wrote;Her Majesty never liked any thing you gave her so well, the colour and strange trimming of the garments, with the rich and great cost bestowed upon that, has caused her to give out such good speeches of my lord and your Ladyship as I never heard of better, she told my Lord of Leicester and my Lord Chamberlain that you had given her such garments this year as she never had any so well liked her, and said that good noble couple, they show in all things what love they bear me.

It was not until Mary was removed to another keeper, Sir Amias Paulet, that she got into the trouble that would lead ultimately to her execution. Previous to the Queen&#x27;s change in custody, Shrewsbury and Bess separated for good. They had been apart, off and on, since about 1580; and even Queen Elizabeth had tried to get them to reconcile. Mary seems to have aggravated, if not created, their problems by playing them off against each other. The Countess spread rumors that her husband Shrewsbury had been in a relationship with Mary, a charge which has never been proved or disproved, and in any case which she later retracted, but seems unlikely given Shrewsbury&#x27;s disposition and increasingly poor health. On his death in 1590, Bess became Dowager Countess of Shrewsbury. She lived mostly at Hardwick, where she built the new mansion Hardwick Hall, which inspired the rhyme, &quot;Hardwick Hall, more glass than wall&quot;, because of the number and size of its windows. She was indeed one of the greatest builders of her time at Hardwick, Chatsworth House, and Oldcoates.

==The Stuart connection==
In 1574 Bess arranged a marriage between one of her daughters and the son of the Countess of Lennox. This was a significant match for Bess because the Countess of Lennox was Margaret Douglas, a member of the royal family, being the daughter of Margaret Tudor, Queen Dowager of Scotland and sister of Henry VIII, and therefore, also Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s first cousin.

In this match, the bride was Bess&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth Cavendish, and the groom was Charles Stuart, who was himself also the first cousin of Mary, Queen of Scots, (through their grandmother, the same Margaret Tudor). The groom was also the younger brother of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley who had been married to Mary until his death. This marriage, therefore, enabled a claim to the throne for any of Bess&#x27;s grandchildren born of the marriage.

The marriage ceremony took place without the knowledge of Shrewsbury, who, though well aware of the suggested match some time prior to this event, declined to accept any responsibility. Due to the Lennox family&#x27;s claim to the throne, the marriage was considered potentially treasonable, since Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s consent had not been obtained.

The Countess of Lennox, mother of the bridegroom, went to the Tower for several months, and Bess was ordered to London to face an official inquiry, but she ignored the summons, and remained in Sheffield until the row died down. The child of the marriage was Arbella Stuart, who had a claim to the thrones of Scotland and England as the second cousin to King James VI of Scotland (later King James I of England), through their great-grandmother, Margaret Tudor.

Arbella was at times invited to Elizabeth&#x27;s court, but spent most of her time with her grandmother. A BBC documentary showed that Bess very much desired Arbella to become Queen, even imprisoning the young lady to prevent her from eloping. Arbella blamed her grandmother for this, and the two fell out irrevocably when Arbella attempted to run away and marry a man who, as a descendant of Henry VII, also had a claim to the throne. Bess cut Arbella from her will and begged the Queen to take her granddaughter off her hands.

Arbella&#x27;s royal claim was never recognized. Despite disinheriting Arbella and her eldest son (Henry: for aiding Arbella&#x27;s escape); Bess later had a &quot;lukewarm reconciliation with her granddaughter. Bess has been an ancestor of the royal line since 1952; Queen Elizabeth II being Bess&#x27;s descendant through the dukes of Portland, in whose family was Elizabeth II&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck.

In 1604 Bess was involved with Queen Anne in an unsuccessful attempt to found a college or university at Ripon in Yorkshire. The scheme was promoted by Cecily Sandys, the widow of the Bishop Edwin Sandys.

==Death and burial==
Bess of Hardwick died at 5 pm on Saturday 13 February 1608, aged c.87. At the time of her death she remained &quot;one of the richest, and most powerful women in the kingdom&quot;. On 16 February her body was placed in a vault in All Saints Church, Derby, then the parish church of that city (demolished 1723 and rebuilt, since 1927 Derby Cathedral), under an elaborate monument with a laudatory inscription which she took care to put up in her lifetime. The monument with effigy survives, having been saved from the former demolished building. Stories of her body lying in state for weeks in the Great Chamber at Hardwick are mythical. Her accumulated estates were left to her children from her second marriage.

==Fiction==
===Television===
* A 10-part BBC series about Bess titled &quot;Mistress of Hardwick&quot; was broadcast in 1972, with Hilary Mason in the title role. The script was written by Alison Plowden, and the series won the Writers&#x27; Guild Award for the best educational television series. Most of the episodes are now lost. Plowden wrote a tie-in book, also called &quot;Mistress of Hardwick&quot;, which was published by the BBC in April 1972.

<text>In music theory, a leading tone (also called subsemitone or leading note in the UK) is a note or pitch which resolves or &quot;leads&quot; to a note one semitone higher or lower, being a lower and upper leading tone, respectively. Typically, leading tone refers to the seventh scale degree of a major scale (), a major seventh above the tonic. In the movable do solfège system, the leading tone is sung as &quot;si&quot;.

A leading-tone triad is a triad built on the seventh scale degree in a major key (vii in Roman numeral analysis), while a leading-tone seventh chord is a seventh chord built on the seventh scale degree (vii7). Walter Piston considers and notates vii as V, an incomplete dominant seventh chord. (For the Roman numeral notation of these chords, see Roman numeral analysis.)

== Note ==

=== Seventh scale degree (or lower leading tone) ===
Typically, when people speak of &quot;the&quot; leading tone, they mean the seventh scale degree () of the major scale, which has a strong affinity for and leads melodically to the tonic. It is sung as &quot;si&quot; in movable-do solfège. For example, in the F major scale, the leading note is the note E.

: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative f&#x27; {
 \clef treble \key f \major \time 7/4 f4 g a bes c d \once \override NoteHead.color = #red e f2
&lt;/score&gt;

As a diatonic function, the leading tone is the seventh scale degree of any diatonic scale when the distance between it and the tonic is a single semitone. In diatonic scales in which there is a whole tone between the seventh scale degree and the tonic, such as the Mixolydian mode, the seventh degree is called the &quot;subtonic&quot;. However, in modes without a leading tone, such as Dorian and Mixolydian, a raised seventh is often featured during cadences, such as in the harmonic minor scale.

A leading tone outside of the current scale is called a &quot;secondary leading tone&quot;, leading to a &quot;secondary tonic&quot;. It functions to briefly tonicize a scale tone (usually the 5th degree) as part of a secondary dominant chord. In the second measure of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Waldstein Sonata&quot; (shown below), the F&#x27;s function as secondary leading tones, which resolve to G in the next measure.

&lt;/score&gt;

===Descending, or upper, leading tone===

By contrast, a descending, or upper, leading tone is a leading tone that resolves &quot;down&quot;, as opposed to the seventh scale degree (a &quot;lower&quot; leading tone) which resolves up. The descending, or upper, leading tone usually is a lowered second degree () resolving to the tonic, but the expression may at times refer to a resolving to the dominant. In German, the term &quot;Gegenleitton&quot; (&quot;counter leading tone&quot;) is used by Hugo Riemann to denote the descending or upper leading-tone (), but Heinrich Schenker uses (&quot;descending leading tone&quot;) to mean the descending diatonic supertonic ().)

The tritone substitution, chord progression ii–subV–I on C (Dm–Db7–C), results in an upper leading note.

=== Analysis ===
According to Ernst Kurth, the major and minor thirds contain &quot;latent&quot; tendencies towards the perfect fourth and whole tone, respectively, and thus establish tonality. However, Carl Dahlhaus contests Kurth&#x27;s position, holding that this drive is in fact created through or with harmonic function, a root progression in another voice by a whole tone or fifth, or melodically (monophonically) by the context of the scale. For example, the leading tone of alternating C chord and F minor chords is either the note E leading to F (if F is tonic), or A leading to G (if C is tonic).

In works from the 14th- and 15th-century Western tradition, the leading tone is created by the progression from imperfect to perfect consonances, such as a major third to a perfect fifth or minor third to a unison. The same pitch outside of the imperfect consonance is not a leading tone.

Forte claims that the leading tone is only one example of a more general tendency: the strongest progressions, melodic and harmonic, are by half step. He suggests that one play a G major scale and stop on the seventh note (F) to personally experience the feeling of lack caused by the &quot;particularly strong attraction&quot; of the seventh note to the eighth (F→G&#x27;), thus its name.

==Leading-tone triad==
A leading-tone chord is a triad built on the seventh scale degree in major and the raised seventh-scale-degree in minor. The quality of the leading-tone triad is diminished in both major and minor keys. For example, in both C major and C minor, it is a B diminished triad (though it is usually written in first inversion, as described below).

According to John Bunyan Herbert, (who uses the term &quot;subtonic&quot;, which later came to usually refer to a seventh scale degree pitched a whole tone below the tonic note),

=== Function ===
The leading-tone triad is used in several functions. It is commonly used as a passing chord between a root position tonic triad and a first inversion tonic triad: that is, &quot;In addition to its basic function of passing between I and I, VII has another important function: it can form a neighboring chord to I or I.&quot; In that instance, the leading-tone triad prolongs tonic through neighbor and passing motion. The example below shows two measures from the fourth movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 3 in C major, Op. 2 in which a leading-tone triad functions as a passing chord between I and I.

 »
&lt;/score&gt;

The leading-tone triad may also be regarded as an incomplete dominant seventh chord: &quot;A chord is called &#x27;Incomplete&#x27; when its root is omitted. This omission occurs, occasionally, in the chord of the dom.-seventh, and the result is a triad upon the leading tone.&quot;

:&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;

 &lt;g b d f&gt;^\markup { \column { &quot;Dominant&quot; &quot;seventh chord&quot; } }
}
&lt;/score&gt;
Some sources say the chord is not a chord; some argue it is an incomplete dominant seventh chord, especially when the diminished triad is written in its first inversion (resembling a second inversion dominant seventh without a root):

For example, vii often substitutes for V, which it closely resembles, and its use may be required in situations by voice leading: &quot;In a strict four-voice texture, if the bass is doubled by the soprano, the VII [vii] is required as a substitute for the V&quot;.

=== Voice leading ===
Since the leading-tone triad is a diminished triad, it is usually found in its first inversion: According to Carl Edward Gardner, &quot;The first inversion of the triad is considered, by many, preferable to root position. The second inversion of the triad is unusual. Some theorists forbid its use.&quot;

In a four-part chorale texture, the third of the leading-tone triad is doubled in order to avoid adding emphasis on the tritone created by the root and the fifth. Unlike a dominant chord where the leading tone can be frustrated and not resolve to the tonic if it is in an inner voice, the leading tone in a leading-tone triad must resolve to the tonic. Commonly, the fifth of the triad resolves down since it is phenomenologically similar to the seventh in a dominant seventh chord. All in all, the tritone resolves &quot;inward&quot; if it is written as a diminished fifth (m. 1 below) and &quot;outward&quot; if it is written as an augmented fourth (m. 2).

 &lt;f b&gt;2 &lt;e c&#x27;&gt; \bar &quot;||&quot;
&lt;/score&gt;

== Leading-tone seventh chord ==
The leading-tone seventh chords are vii7 and vii7, the half-diminished and diminished seventh chords on the seventh scale degree () of the major and harmonic minor. For example, in C major and C minor, the leading-tone seventh chords are B half-diminished (B–D–F–A) and B diminished (B–D–F–A), respectively.

Leading-tone seventh chords were not characteristic of Renaissance music but are typical of the Baroque and Classical period. They are used more freely in Romantic music but began to be used less in classical music as conventions of tonality broke down. They are integral to ragtime and contemporary popular and jazz music genres.

Composers throughout the common practice period often employed modal mixture when using the leading-tone seventh chord in a major key, allowing for the substitution of the half-diminished seventh chord with the fully diminished seventh chord (by lowering its seventh). This mixture is commonly used when the leading-tone seventh chord is functioning as a secondary leading-tone chord.

The example below shows fully diminished seventh chords in the key of D major in the right hand in the third movement of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 5 in G major.

=== Function ===
The leading-tone seventh chord has a dominant function and may be used in place of V or V. Just as vii is sometimes considered an incomplete dominant seventh chord, a leading-tone seventh chord is often considered a &quot;dominant ninth chord without root&quot;.)

 &lt;g b d f aes&gt;^\markup { \column { &quot;Dominant minor&quot; &quot;ninth chord&quot; } }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

For variety, leading-tone seventh chords are frequently substituted for dominant chords, with which they have three common tones: &quot;The seventh chord founded upon the subtonic [in major]... is occasionally used. It resolves directly to the tonic... This chord may be employed without preparation.&quot;

=== Voice leading ===
In contrast to leading-tone triads, leading-tone seventh chords appear in root position. The example below shows leading-tone seventh chords (in root position) functioning as dominants in a reduction of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, K. 527, act 1, scene 13.

<text>In music theory, the key of a piece is the group of pitches, or scale, that forms the basis of a musical composition in Western classical music, jazz music, art music, and pop music.

A particular key features a &quot;tonic (main) note&quot; and its corresponding &quot;chords&quot;, also called a &quot;tonic&quot; or &quot;tonic chord&quot;, which provides a subjective sense of arrival and rest. The tonic also has a unique relationship to the other pitches of the same key, their corresponding chords, and pitches and chords outside the key. Notes and chords other than the tonic in a piece create varying degrees of tension, resolved when the tonic note or chord returns.

The key may be in the major or minor mode, though musicians assume major when this is not specified; for example, &quot;this piece is in C&quot; implies that the key of the piece is C major. Popular songs and classical music from the common practice period are usually in one key. Longer pieces in the classical repertoire may have sections in contrasting keys. Key changes within a section or movement are known as modulation.

==Overview==
Methods that establish the key for a particular piece can be complicated to explain and vary over music history. However, the chords most often used in a piece in a particular key are those that contain the notes in the corresponding scale, and conventional progressions of these chords, particularly cadences, orient the listener around the tonic.

The key signature is not always a reliable guide to the key of a written piece. It does not discriminate between a major key and its relative minor; the piece may modulate to a different key; if the modulation is brief, it may not involve a change of key signature, being indicated instead with accidentals. Occasionally, a piece in a mode such as Mixolydian or Dorian is written with a major or minor key signature appropriate to the tonic, and accidentals throughout the piece.

Pieces in modes not corresponding to major or minor keys may sometimes be referred to as being in the key of the tonic. A piece using some other type of harmony, resolving e.g. to A, might be described as &quot;in A&quot; to indicate that A is the tonal center of the piece.

An instrument &quot;in a key&quot;, is an unrelated usage that means the pitches considered &quot;natural&quot; for that instrument. For example, modern trumpets are usually in the key of B, since the notes produced without using the valves correspond to the harmonic series whose fundamental pitch is B. (Such instruments are called &quot;transposing&quot; when their written notes differ from concert pitch.)

A key relationship is the relationship between keys, measured by common tone and nearness on the circle of fifths. See closely related key.

==Keys and tonality==
Perfect authentic cadence (V-I [here in [[Dominant seventh|V7]]-I form] with roots in the bass and tonic in the highest voice of the final chord): [[ii-V-I progression|ii-V7-I progression]] in C

The key usually identifies the tonic note and/or chord: the note and/or major or minor triad that represents the final point of rest for a piece, or the focal point of a section. Though the key of a piece may be named in the title (e.g., Symphony in C major), or inferred from the key signature, the establishment of key is brought about via functional harmony, a sequence of chords leading to one or more cadences, and/or melodic motion (such as movement from the leading-tone to the tonic). For example, the key of G includes the following pitches: G, A, B, C, D, E, and F; and its corresponding tonic chord is G—B—D. Most often at the beginning and end of traditional pieces during the common practice period, the tonic, sometimes with its corresponding tonic chord, begins and ends a piece in a designated key. A key may be major or minor. Music can be described as being in the Dorian mode, or Phrygian, etc., and is thus usually thought of as in a specific mode rather than a key. Languages other than English may use other key naming systems.

People sometimes confuse key with scale. A &quot;scale&quot; is an ordered set of notes typically used in a key, while the &quot;key&quot; is the &quot;center of gravity&quot; established by particular chord progressions.

Cadences are particularly important in the establishment of key. Even cadences that do not include the tonic note or triad, such as &quot;half cadences&quot; and &quot;deceptive cadences&quot;, serve to establish key because those chord sequences imply a unique diatonic context.

Short pieces may stay in a single key throughout. A typical pattern for a simple song might be as follows: a phrase ends with a cadence on the tonic, a second phrase ends with a half cadence, then a final, longer, phrase ends with an authentic cadence on the tonic.

More elaborate pieces may establish the main key, then modulate to another key, or a series of keys, then back to the original key. In the Baroque it was common to repeat an entire phrase of music, called a ritornello, in each key once it was established. In Classical sonata form, the second key was typically marked with a contrasting theme. Another key may be treated as a temporary tonic, called tonicization.

In common practice period compositions, and most of the Western popular music of the 20th century, pieces always begin and end in the same key, even if (as in some Romantic-era music) the key is deliberately left ambiguous at first. Some arrangements of popular songs, however, modulate sometime during the song (often in a repeat of the final chorus) and thus end in a different key. This is an example of modulation.

In rock and popular music some pieces change back and forth, or modulate, between two keys. Examples of this include Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Dreams&quot; and The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;. &quot;This phenomenon occurs when a feature that allows multiple interpretations of key (usually a diatonic set as pitch source) is accompanied by other, more precise evidence in support of each possible interpretation (such as the use of one note as the root of the initiating harmony and persistent use of another note as pitch of melodic resolution and root of the final harmony of each phrase).&quot;

==Instruments in a key==
Certain musical instruments play in a certain key, or have their music written in a certain key. Instruments that do not play in the key of C are known as transposing instruments. The most common kind of clarinet, for example, is said to play in the key of B. This means that a scale written in C major in sheet music actually sounds as a B major scale when played on the B-flat clarinet—that is, notes sound a whole tone lower than written. Likewise, the horn, normally in the key of F, sounds notes a perfect fifth lower than written.

Similarly, some instruments are &quot;built&quot; in a certain key. For example, a brass instrument built in B plays a fundamental note of B, and can play notes in the harmonic series starting on B without using valves, fingerholes, or slides to alter the length of the vibrating column of air. An instrument built in a certain key often, but not always, uses music written in the same key (see trombone for an exception). However, some instruments, such as the diatonic harmonica and the harp, are in fact designed to play in only one key at a time: accidentals are difficult or impossible to play.

The highland bagpipes are built in B major, though the music is written in D major with implied accidentals.

In Western musical composition, the key of a piece has important ramifications for its composition:

*As noted earlier, certain instruments are designed for a certain key, as playing in that key can be physically easier or harder. Thus the choice of key can be an important one when composing for an orchestra, as one must take these elements into consideration.
*In the life of the professional clarinetist, for example, it is common to carry two instruments tuned a semitone apart (B and A) to cope with the needs of composers: Mozart&#x27;s well-known clarinet concerto is in A major. To play it on a B instrument is difficult, and to rewrite all the orchestral parts to B major would be an enormous effort. Even so, it is not unheard of for a piece published in B to include notes a semitone (or more) below the range of the common B clarinet. The piece must then be played on a more exotic instrument, or transposed by hand (or at sight) for the slightly larger A clarinet. There are clarinets with an extended range, with a longer bore and additional keys.
*Besides this though, the timbre of almost any instrument is not exactly the same for all notes played on that instrument. For this reason a piece that might be in the key of C might sound or &quot;feel&quot; somewhat different (besides being in a different pitch) to a listener if it is transposed to the key of A.
*In addition, since many composers often utilized the piano while composing, the key chosen can possibly have an effect over the composing. This is because the physical fingering is different for each key, which may lend itself to choosing to play and thus eventually write certain notes or chord progressions compared to others, or this may be done on purpose to make the fingering more efficient if the final piece is intended for piano.
*In music that does not use equal temperament, chords played in different keys are qualitatively different.

==Key coloration==

Key coloration is the difference between the intervals of different keys in a single non-equal tempered tuning, and the overall sound and &quot;feel&quot; of the key created by the tuning of its intervals.

Historical irregular musical temperaments usually have the narrowest fifths between the diatonic notes (&quot;naturals&quot;) producing purer thirds, and wider fifths among the chromatic notes (&quot;sharps and flats&quot;). Each key then has a slightly different intonation, hence different keys have distinct characters. Such &quot;key coloration&quot; was an essential part of much eighteenth- and nineteenth-century music and was described in treatises of the period.

For example, in tunings with a wolf fifth, the key on the lowest note of the fifth sounds dramatically different from other keys (and is often avoided). In Pythagorean tuning on C (C, E+, G: 4, 5, 6), the major triad on C is just while the major triad on E+++ (F) is noticeably out of tune (E+++, A+, C: , 5, 6) due to E+++ (521.44 cents) being a Pythagorean comma (23.46 cents) larger sharp compared to F.

Music using equal temperament lacks key coloration because all keys have the same pattern of intonation, differing only in pitch.

<doc id="70642" wikidata="Q298808" url="?curid=70642" title="Alfonso XI of Castile">
<text>Alfonso XI (11 August 131126 March 1350), called the Avenger (&quot;el Justiciero&quot;), was King of Castile and León. He was the son of Ferdinand IV of Castile and his wife Constance of Portugal. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1312, several disputes ensued over who would hold regency, which were resolved in 1313.

Once Alfonso was declared an adult in 1325, he began a reign that would serve to strengthen royal power. 

==Life==
===Minority===
Born on 13 August 1311 in Salamanca, he was the son of King Ferdinand IV of Castile and Constance of Portugal. His father died when Alfonso was one year old. His grandmother, María de Molina, his mother Constance, his granduncle Infante John of Castile, son of King Alfonso X of Castile and uncle Infante Peter of Castile, son of King Sancho IV assumed the regency. His mother died first on 18 November 1313, followed by Infantes John and Peter during a military campaign against Granada in 1319 at the Disaster of the Vega, which left Dowager Queen María as the only regent until her death on 1 July 1321.

Alfonso inherited the throne at a time of instability within the region, decline in populations, reductions in the royal treasury and increasingly ambitious regents caused numerous problems during his young reign.

After the death of the Infantes John and Peter in 1319, Philip (son of Sancho IV and María de Molina, thus brother of Infante Peter), Juan Manuel (the king&#x27;s second-degree uncle by virtue of being Ferdinand III&#x27;s grandson) and Juan the One-eyed (his second-degree uncle, son of John of Castile who died in 1319) split the kingdom among themselves according to their aspirations for regency, even as it was being looted by Moors and the rebellious nobility.

A 14th century chronicle mentioned his appearance as &quot;...King Alfonso was not very tall but well proportioned, and he was rather strong and had fair skin and hair.&quot;

===Majority===
His effective reign began in August 1325 when he was sworn in as king as he was proclaimed to have reached the age of majority in the Cortes of Valladolid. Following a ritual that took him to Santiago de Compostela and to the monastery of Las Huelgas in Burgos, his self-crowning took place in 1332.

As soon as he took the throne, he began working hard to strengthen royal power by dividing his enemies. His early display of ruthless rulership skills included the unhesitant execution of possible opponents. Alfonso XI ordered the assassination of Juan the One-eyed in Toro in the 1326 feast of All Saints, along with two of the latter&#x27;s knights, luring the former with promises of reconciliation.

He managed to extend the limits of his kingdom to the Strait of Gibraltar after the important victory at the Battle of Río Salado against the Marinid dynasty in 1340 and the conquest of Algeciras in 1344. Once that conflict was resolved, he redirected all his Reconquista efforts to fighting the Moorish king of Granada.

During his reign a political reform in the municipal government took place, with the substitution of the &quot;concejos abiertos&quot; by the &quot;regimientos&quot;. He fostered the issuance of &quot;cartas pueblas&quot; as strategy for the demographic strengthening in the borderland areas.

He is variously known among Castilian kings as the Avenger or the Implacable, and as &quot;He of Río Salado.&quot; The first two names he earned by the ferocity with which he repressed the disorders caused by the nobles during his long minority; the third by his victory in the Battle of Río Salado over the last formidable Marinid invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 1340.

Alfonso XI never went to the extreme lengths of his son Peter of Castile, but he could be bloody in his methods. He killed for reasons of state without any form of trial. He openly neglected his wife, Maria of Portugal, and indulged a scandalous passion for Eleanor of Guzman, who bore him ten children.

Stricken with plague during the 1349–1350 siege of Gibraltar, Alfonso died in the night of 25–26 March 1350 (some sources put the date wrongfully at 27 March) becoming one of the most prominent victims of the Black Death. The Castilian forces withdrew from Gibraltar, with some of the defenders coming out to watch. Out of respect, Alfonso&#x27;s rival Yusuf I of Granada ordered his army and his commanders in the border regions not to attack the Castilian procession as it traveled with the king&#x27;s body to Seville.

==Marriage and issue==
Alfonso XI first married Constanza Manuel in 1325, but had the union annulled two years later. His second marriage, in 1328, was to his double first cousin Maria of Portugal, daughter of Alfonso IV of Portugal. They had:
* Two sons buried with their mother in the Royal Monastery of San Clemente in Seville. One of them, the firstborn Fernando, died a few months after birth.
* Peter of Castile (1334–1369), King of Castile.

By his mistress, Eleanor of Guzmán, he had ten children:
* Pedro Alfonso (1331/1332–1338), 1st Lord of Aguilar de Campoo;
* Sancho Alfonso (1332/1333–1342), 1st Lord of Ledesma;
* Henry II of Castile (1333/1334–1379), King of Castile (1369–1379)
* Fadrique Alfonso (1333/1334–1358), Henry&#x27;s twin brother, he was Master of the Order of Santiago and 1st Lord of Haro;
* Fernando Alfonso (1334–c. 1350), 2nd Lord of Ledesma;
* Tello Alfonso (1337–1370), 2nd Lord of Aguilar de Campoo;
* Juan Alfonso (1340–1359), 1st Lord of Jerez de los Caballeros;
* Juana Alfonso (1342–after 1376), Lady of Trastámara due to her marriage in 1354 to Fernando Ruiz de Castro. The marriage was annulled and in 1366 she married Felipe de Castro;
* Sancho Alfonso (1343–1375), 1st Count of Alburquerque;
* Pedro Alfonso (1345–1359)

After Alfonso&#x27;s death, his widow Maria had Eleanor arrested and later killed.

==Popular culture==
He was depicted in the 1802 play &quot;Alfonso, King of Castile&quot; by the British writer Matthew Lewis. It was first staged at London&#x27;s Covent Garden Theatre with Charles Murray in the title role.

<doc id="70643" wikidata="Q299156" url="?curid=70643" title="Alfonso II of Aragon">
<text>Alfonso II (1–25 March 1157 – 25 April 1196), called the Chaste or the Troubadour, was the King of Aragon and, as Alfons I, the Count of Barcelona from 1164 until his death. The eldest son of Count Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona and Queen Petronilla of Aragon, he was the first King of Aragon who was also Count of Barcelona. He was also Count of Provence, which he secured from Douce II and her would-be father-in-law Raymond V, Count of Toulouse, from 1166 until 1173, when he ceded it to his brother, Ramon Berenguer III. His reign has been characterised by nationalistic and nostalgic Catalan historians as &quot;l&#x27;engrandiment occitànic&quot; or &quot;the Pyrenean unity&quot;: a great scheme to unite various lands on both sides of the Pyrenees under the rule of the House of Barcelona.

==Reign==
Born at Huesca, Alfonso, called indistinctly from birth Alfonso and Ramon, ascended the united throne of Aragon and Barcelona as Alfonso, in deference to the Aragonese, to honour Alfonso the Battler.

For most of his reign he was allied with Alfonso VIII of Castile, both against
Navarre and against the Moorish taifas of the south. In his
Reconquista effort Alfonso pushed as far as Teruel, conquering this important
stronghold on the road to Valencia in 1171. The same year saw him capturing Caspe.

Apart from common interests, kings of Aragon and Castile were united by a formal bond of vassalage the former owed to the latter. Besides, on January 18, 1174, in Zaragoza Alfonso married Sancha, sister of the Castilian king. Another milestone in this alliance was the Treaty of Cazorla between the two kings in 1179, delineating zones of conquest in the south along the watershed of the rivers Júcar and Segura. Southern areas of Valencia including Denia were thus secured to Aragon. Alfonso also reached an agreement, the Treaty of Sangüesa (1168), with Sancho VI of Navarre dividing the territory of the Taifa of Murcia between them.

During his reign Aragonese influence north of the Pyrenees reached its zenith, a natural tendency given the affinity between the Occitan, Catalan and Aragonese dominions of the Crown of Aragon. His realms incorporated not only Provence (from 1166 or just before), but also the counties of Cerdanya (1168) and Roussillon (inherited in 1172). Béarn and Bigorre paid homage to him in 1187. Alfonso&#x27;s involvement in the affairs of Languedoc, which would cost the life of his successor, Peter II of Aragon, for the moment proved highly beneficial, strengthening Aragonese trade and stimulating emigration from the north to colonise the newly reconquered lands in Aragon.

In 1186, he helped establish Aragonese influence in Sardinia when he supported his cousin Agalbursa, the widow of the deceased Judge of Arborea, Barison II, in placing her grandson, the child of her eldest daughter Ispella, Hugh, on the throne of Arborea in opposition to Peter of Serra.

Alfonso II provided the first land grant to the Cistercian monks on the banks of the Ebro River in the Aragon region, which would become the site of the first Cistercian monastery in this region. The Monasterio de Piedra was founded in 1194 with thirteen monks from Poblet Monastery, in an old castle next to the Piedra river, the Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda was founded in 1202 and utilized some of the first hydrological technology in the region for harnessing water power and river diversion for the purpose of building central heating. He also became a patron to the Carthusians and founded the first chapterhouse of Scala Dei in 1196.

He died at Perpignan in 1196.

==Literary patronage and poetry==
He was a noted poet of his time and a close friend of King Richard the Lionheart. One tensó, &quot;Be·m plairia, Seingner En Reis&quot;, apparently composed by him and Giraut de Bornelh, forms part of the poetical debate as to whether a lady is dishonoured by taking a lover who is richer than herself. The debate had been begun by Guilhem de Saint-Leidier and was taken up by Azalais de Porcairagues and Raimbaut of Orange; there was also a &quot;partimen&quot; on the topic between Dalfi d&#x27;Alvernha and Perdigon.

Alfonso and his love affairs are mentioned in poems by many troubadours, including Guillem de Berguedà (who criticized his dealings with Azalais of Toulouse) and Peire Vidal, who commended Alfonso&#x27;s decision to marry Sancha rather than Eudokia Komnene that he had preferred a poor Castilian maid to the emperor Manuel&#x27;s golden camel.

==Marriage and descendants==
Alfonso married Sancha of Castile, daughter of king Alfonso VII of Castile. They had:
* Peter II (1174/76 – 14 September 1213), King of Aragon and Lord of Montpellier
* Constance (1179 – 23 June 1222), married firstly King Emeric of Hungary and secondly Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor
* Alfonso II (1180 – February 1209), Count of Provence, Millau and Razès.
* Eleanor (1182 – February 1226), married Raymond VI of Toulouse
* Ramon Berenguer (ca. 1183/85 – died young).
* Sancha (1186 – aft. 1241), married Raymond VII of Toulouse, in March 1211 
* Ferdinand (1190 – 1249), cistercian monk, Abbot of Montearagón.
* Dulcia (1192 – ?), a nun at Sijena.

<text>Ferdinand III (; 1199/120130 May 1252), called the Saint (&quot;el Santo&quot;), was King of Castile from 1217 and King of León from 1230 as well as King of Galicia from 1231. He was the son of Alfonso IX of León and Berenguela of Castile. Through his second marriage he was also Count of Aumale. Ferdinand III was one of the most successful kings of Castile, securing not only the permanent union of the crowns of Castile and León, but also masterminding the most expansive southward territorial expansion campaign yet in the Guadalquivir Valley, in which Islamic rule was in disarray in the wake of the defeat of the Almohad caliphate at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. His repeated and decisive victories against the Islamic Caliphate earned him the title Athleta Christi, meaning &#x27;Champion of Christ&#x27;, which was conferred upon him by Pope Gregory IX.

By military and diplomatic efforts, Ferdinand greatly expanded the dominions of Castile by annexing the crown of Guadalquivir river valley in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, establishing the boundaries of the Castilian state for the next two centuries. New territories included important cities such as Baeza, Úbeda, Jaén, Córdoba and Seville, that were subject of Repartimiento, given a new general charter and repopulated in the following years.

Ferdinand was canonized in 1671 by Pope Clement X. Places such as the cities of San Fernando, Pampanga and San Fernando, La Union; the Diocese of Ilagan and the San Fernando de Dilao Church in Paco, Manila in the Philippines; and in the United States, in California the City of San Fernando, the San Fernando Valley, and in Texas the Cathedral of San Fernando in San Antonio were named in his honor.

==Early life==

The exact date of Ferdinand&#x27;s birth is unclear. It has been proposed to have been as early as 1199 or even 1198, although more recent researchers commonly date Ferdinand&#x27;s birth in the summer of 1201. Ferdinand was born at the Monastery of Valparaíso (Peleas de Arriba, in what is now the Province of Zamora).

As the son of Alfonso IX of León and his second wife Berengaria of Castile, Ferdinand descended from Alfonso VII of León and Castile on both sides; his paternal grandfather Ferdinand II of León and maternal great grandfather Sancho III of Castile were the sons of Alfonso VII between whom his kingdom was divided. Ferdinand had other royal ancestors from his paternal grandmother Urraca of Portugal and his maternal grandmother Eleanor of England a daughter of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine.

The marriage of Ferdinand&#x27;s parents was annulled by order of Pope Innocent III in 1204, due to consanguinity, but the legitimacy of the children was recognized. Berengaria then took their children, including Ferdinand, to the court of her father, King Alfonso VIII of Castile. In 1217, her younger brother, Henry I, died and she succeeded him on the Castilian throne with Ferdinand as her heir, but she quickly surrendered it to her son.

Alfonso of León considered himself tricked, and the young king had to begin his reign by a war against his father and a faction of the Castilian nobles. His and his mother&#x27;s abilities proved too much for the king of Leon and his Castilian allies. Berengaria continued to be a key influence on Ferdinand, following her advice in prosecuting wars and even in the choice of a wife, Elisabeth of Swabia.

== Unification of Castile and León ==

When Ferdinand&#x27;s father died in 1230, his will delivered the kingdom to his older daughters Sancha and Dulce, from his first marriage to Teresa of Portugal. But Ferdinand contested the will, and claimed the inheritance for himself. At length, an agreement was reached, negotiated primarily between their mothers, Berengaria and Teresa. The resulting treaty of Benavente was signed on 11 December 1230, by which Ferdinand received the Kingdom of León, in return for a substantial compensation in cash and lands for his half-sisters, Sancha and Dulce. Ferdinand thus became the first sovereign of both kingdoms since the death of Alfonso VII in 1157.

Early in his reign, Ferdinand had to deal with a rebellion of the House of Lara.

== Reconquest of al-Andalus ==

Since the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 halted the advance of the Almohads in Spain, a series of truces had kept Castile and the Almohad dominions of al-Andalus more-or-less at peace. However, a crisis of succession in the Almohad Caliphate after the death of Yusuf II in 1224 gave Ferdinand III an opportunity for intervention. The Andalusian-based claimant, Abdallah al-Adil, began to ship the bulk of Almohad arms and men across the straits to Morocco to contest the succession with his rival there, leaving al-Andalus relatively undefended. Al-Adil&#x27;s rebellious cousin, Abdullah al-Bayyasi (the Baezan), appealed to Ferdinand III for military assistance against the usurper. In 1225, a Castilian army accompanied al-Bayyasi in a campaign, ravaging the regions of Jaén, vega de Granada and, before the end of the year, had successfully installed al-Bayyasi in Córdoba. In payment, al-Bayyasi gave Ferdinand the strategic frontier strongholds of Baños de la Encina, Salvatierra (the old Order of Calatrava fortress near Ciudad Real) and Capilla (the last of which had to be taken by siege). When al-Bayyasi was rejected and killed by a popular uprising in Córdoba shortly after, the Castilians remained in occupation of al-Bayyasi&#x27;s holdings in Andújar, Baeza and Martos.

The crisis in the Almohad Caliphate, however, remained unresolved. In 1228, a new Almohad pretender, Idris al-Ma&#x27;mun, decided to abandon Spain, and left with the last remnant of the Almohad forces for Morocco. Al-Andalus was left fragmented in the hands of local strongmen, only loosely led by Muhammad ibn Yusuf ibn Hud al-Judhami. Seeing the opportunity, the Christian kings of the north – Ferdinand III of Castile, Alfonso IX of León, James I of Aragon and Sancho II of Portugal – immediately launched a series of raids on al-Andalus, renewed almost every year. There were no great battle encounters – Ibn Hud&#x27;s makeshift Andalusian army was destroyed early on, while attempting to stop the Leonese at Alange in 1230. The Christian armies romped through the south virtually unopposed in the field. Individual Andalusian cities were left to resist or negotiate their capitulation by themselves, with little or no prospect of rescue from Morocco or anywhere else.

The twenty years from 1228 to 1248 saw the most massive advance in the reconquista yet. In this great sweep, most of the great old citadels of al-Andalus fell one by one. Ferdinand III took the lion&#x27;s share of the spoils – Badajoz and Mérida (which had fallen to the Leonese), were promptly inherited by Ferdinand in 1230; then by his own effort, Cazorla in 1231, Úbeda in 1233, the old Umayyad capital of Córdoba in 1236, Niebla and Huelva in 1238, Écija and Lucena in 1240, Orihuela and Murcia in 1243 (by the famous &#x27;pact of Alcaraz&#x27;), Arjona, Mula and Lorca in 1244, Cartagena in 1245, Jaén in 1246, Alicante in 1248 and finally, on 22 December 1248, Ferdinand III entered as a conqueror in Seville, the greatest of Andalusian cities. At the end of this twenty-year onslaught, only a rump Andalusian state, the Emirate of Granada, remained unconquered (and even so, Ferdinand III managed to extract a tributary arrangement from Granada in 1238).

Ferdinand annexed some of his conquests directly into the Crown of Castile, and others were initially received and organized as vassal states under Muslim governors (e.g. Alicante, Niebla, Murcia), although they too were eventually permanently occupied and absorbed into Castile before the end of the century (Niebla in 1262, Murcia in 1264, Alicante in 1266). Outside of these vassal states, Christian rule could be heavy-handed on the new Muslim subjects. The range of Castilian conquests also sometimes transgressed into the spheres of interest of other conquerors. Thus, along the way, Ferdinand III took care to carefully negotiate with the other Christian kings to avoid conflict, e.g. the treaty of Almizra (26 March 1244) which delineated the Murcian boundary with James I of Aragon.

Ferdinand divided the conquered territories between the Knights, the Church, and the nobility, whom he endowed with great latifundia. When he took Córdoba, he ordered the &quot;Liber Iudiciorum&quot; to be adopted and observed by its citizens, and caused it to be rendered, albeit inaccurately, into Castilian.

The capture of Córdoba was the result of a well-planned and executed process whereby parts of the city (the Ajarquía) first fell to the independent almogavars of the Sierra Morena to the north, which Ferdinand had not at the time subjugated. Only in 1236 did Ferdinand arrive with a royal army to take the Medina, the religious and administrative centre of the city. Ferdinand set up a council of &quot;partidores&quot; to divide the conquests and between 1237 and 1244 a great deal of land was parcelled out to private individuals and members of the royal family as well as to the Church. On 10 March 1241, Ferdinand established seven outposts to define the boundary of the province of Córdoba. Following his conquest of Cordoba, Pope Gregory IX hailed Ferdinand as an &quot;athleta Christi&quot;(champion of Christ) and ordered bishops in Castile and Leon to provide him with 20,000 gold pieces a year, for three years.

== Domestic policy ==

On the domestic front, Ferdinand strengthened the University of Salamanca and erected the current Cathedral of Burgos. He was a patron of the newest movement in the Church, that of the mendicant Orders. Whereas the Benedictine monks, and then the Cistercians and Cluniacs, had taken a major part in the &quot;Reconquista&quot; up until then, Ferdinand founded houses for friars of the Dominican, Franciscan, Trinitarian, and Mercedarian Orders throughout Andalusia, thus determining the future religious character of that region. Ferdinand has also been credited with sustaining the &quot;convivencia&quot; in Andalusia. He himself joined the Third Order of St. Francis, and is honored in that Order.

He took care not to overburden his subjects with taxation, fearing, as he said, the curse of one poor woman more than a whole army of Saracens.

== Death ==

Ferdinand III had started out as a contested king of Castile. By the time of his death he had delivered to his son and heir, Alfonso X, a massively expanded kingdom. The boundaries of the new Castilian state established by Ferdinand III remained nearly unchanged until the late 15th century. His biographer, Sister María del Carmen Fernández de Castro Cabeza, A.C.J., asserts that, on his deathbed, Ferdinand said to his son &quot;you will be rich in land and in many good vassals, more than any other king in Christendom.&quot;

Ferdinand&#x27;s death was attributed to a dropsy he contracted in the winter of 1251. His death took place on 30 May 1252, and he was buried in the Cathedral of Seville by his son, Alfonso X. The funeral took place on 1 June 1252 and was officiated by Remondo, Bishop of Segovia, in the cathedral. In the city there were royal vassals, bishops, abbots and wealthy men of the kingdom, who had come to show their lament. His tomb was inscribed in four languages: Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, and an early version of Castilian.

He was canonized as Saint Ferdinand by Pope Clement X in 1671. Today, the incorrupt body of Saint Ferdinand can still be seen in the Cathedral of Seville, for he rests enclosed in a gold and crystal casket worthy of the king. His golden crown still encircles his head as he reclines beneath the statue of the Virgin of the Kings. Several places named San Fernando were founded across the Spanish Empire in his honor. His supposed likeliness, enthronement, sword and orb are depicted on the crest of Sevilla Fútbol Club.

The symbol of his power as a king was his sword Lobera.

== Patronage ==

Saint Ferdinand is the patron saint of Seville, Aranjuez, San Fernando de Henares, Maspalomas, Pivijay, and of several other localities. He is also the patron of the Spanish Army&#x27;s Corps of Engineers, and engineers generally.

Since the establishment in 1819 of the Diocese of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, also called &quot;Diocese of Tenerife&quot; (Canary Islands), Saint Ferdinand is the co-patron of the diocese and of its Cathedral pursuant to the papal bull issued by Pope Pius VII. This is because La Laguna is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Seville whose capital city has Saint Ferdinand as one of its co-patrons, together with the &quot;Virgen de los Reyes&quot;. Saint Ferdinand is also the patron of the University of La Laguna, since this institution was founded under the name of &quot;Universidad Literaria de San Fernando&quot; (Literary University of Saint Ferdinand).

==Family==

===First marriage===

In 1219, Ferdinand married Elisabeth of Swabia (1203–1235). She was the fourth daughter of Philip, Duke of Swabia, and Irene Angelina. Their children were:

# Alfonso X (1221–1284), his successor

# Henry (1230–1303)
# Philip (1231–1274). He was promised to the Church, but was so taken by the beauty of Christina of Norway, daughter of Haakon IV of Norway, who had been intended as a bride for one of his brothers, that he abandoned his holy vows and married her. She died in 1262, childless.
# Sancho, Archbishop of Toledo and Seville (1233–1261)
# Manuel of Castile (1234–1283)
# Maria, died an infant in November 1235
